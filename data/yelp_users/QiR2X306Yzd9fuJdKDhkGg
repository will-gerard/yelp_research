Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.  One of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall "character" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.  This was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.  Ken and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a "lil" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.  The menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the "70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!  I have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search.

Judging by the twenty minute wait to be seated for lunch at 1 PM on a Friday afternoon, Flancer's Cafe in Gilbert (there's one in Mesa, too), doesn't need any publicity from me. There's also more than 50 mostly four and five star reviews on Yelp. And  the Arizona Republic gave it a glowing review in September. After our lunch, I can tell you that Ken and I heartily agree with all the praise.       Flancer's is a small, unpretentious place. The menu is basically bar food - wings, salads, sandwiches, pizza, and some pasta. What made it worth our 30 minute drive is the care and thought that goes into the preparation. Jeff Flancer, the owner, is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. When he gives you a steak sandwich, its a  filet mignon sandwich ($10.75), tender and cooked to order - and served on a freshly baked homemade roll. With caramelized onions and house made chipotle mayo that has the perfect amount of kick. Oh, and gorgonzola cheese, too. Accompanied with an interesting choice of sides, like jalapeno & cheddar mashed potato pie or sweet potato fries. Ken says that Jeff knows what people like to eat, then he thinks of a way to improve on it. Like the onion soup ($3/5) that has a ton of cheese on top, not the thin slice that lots of places try to get away with these days. The pastrami in Ken's "Cure Heaven" sandwich (every item on the menu has a name) was very flavorful, served hot with provolone and mustard ($8). Portions are large, but not overwhelming. The only disappointment was the pickle - not bad, but not up to the level of the rest of the meal.       For nine years, Jeff had a restaurant in Santa Fe. There are a number of dishes using a variety of chilis, like the Santa Fe BLT ($8) that comes with New Mexican green chili mayonnaise. Or the Baked Chipotle Fettuccini (Jeff's spelling) ($11): "Baked fettuccini with sausage, pepperoni & ground beef with chipotle cream marinara sauce & melted mozzarella cheese". An appetizer I have to try is Flancer's Green Chile Mushroom Phyllos ($7.50).       Something that shines through at Flancer's is pride in the staff (our waiter was excellent), and caring for the community. On the website there are pictures and bios of many of the staff members. If you order a particular dessert, proceeds are donated to a youngster from the community who needs a heart transplant. There are raffles and a yearly pizza eating contest with proceeds also going to charity. The vibe here is really good.        Flancer's is open daily from 10:30 to 9 PM, with Happy Hour from 3 - 7 (they serve a Prickly Pear Lemonade spiked with vodka that sounds really good). There's free wi-fi, and on some nights there's music. Check out the menu on their website.

Once upon a long, long time ago life seemed simpler. Neighborhoods were more stable, everybody knew everybody. When you went into a store, the shopkeeper called you by name and probably knew what you were planning to buy. For better or worse (and it certainly wasn't all good) those times are long gone - but we found a little slice of it last Friday.       When we walked into Casella's Italian Sub Shop at about 3PM, we were warmly greeted by Joe and Denise, a father/daughter team. Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the "family" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.       Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.       We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings. In the back cooler you can see huge jars of mayonnaise waiting their turn. The salad was very simple, not gussied up with lots of add-ins. I will say that when I ate the leftovers at home I added a dollop of cranberry sauce. I think I'll bring some to Casella's next time we go.       After 2 PM, if you buy two sandwiches, you get a third free. So I chose the Italian Hoagie ($3.70/$6.80). Ken was astonished to find that he actually enjoyed this one. What made it truly delicious, oddly enough, were the onions. Thinly sliced, and sweet enough to be eaten on their own, they also graced the cheese steak. Our side of homemade coleslaw was one of the best versions in town. Can't wait to try the potato and pasta salads.        Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef, ham and cheese, meatball, sausage, and pastrami (not made in-house). Also available are two entrees: Lasagna ($10) and Spaghetti & Meatballs ($8).        Now for dessert. Ken wanted a cannoli, usually not something I like. I'm now a convert, at least to Casella's version. Denise makes the silky filling, garnished only with a few chocolate chips, and the large, wonderfully crispy shells don't get filled until you're ready to snarf one down. Homemade rice pudding is on the menu. We had a taste and it, too, was delicious, but it had no raisins. We'll bring those next time, along with the cranberry sauce.       Not much to say about the decor. I think it came from that long, long ago time. Basic wood paneling. There are photographs of years and years of Saguaro High (I think that's the school) graduating classes. That's about it. But the warmth of the Casella's fills the room.

If Rosario Ristorante feels like the quintessential neighborhood Italian restaurant, that's because it is. It's been in the same spot for 30 years, and until a few years ago it was owned by the same family. When they were ready to sell, one of their loyal customers took up the gauntlet. Although Michelle and her husband completely gutted and redid the interior, the ambience is still that of a long established, timeless place. There's a red swag on the front windows and wrought iron decorations on the walls. Black tablecloths and nice stemware lend an upscale but not intimidating feel.       The menu, too, is neighborhood. Nothing unexpected (except for escargots), but pretty much whatever you'd want to satisfy your southern Italian cravings.  We started out with crab-stuffed mushrooms, which the menu warned were spicy. Since it was happy hour, when all appetizers are half price (ditto cocktails), we paid $5.50 for six mushrooms delivered in an escargot dish. They were stuffed with just the right amount of crab mixed in with the bread crumbs, and a little cayenne added a pleasant kick. We had been served some outstanding garlic butter with our bread, and couldn't resist topping the mushrooms with it.  My entree was eggplant parmigiana, my "test the new restaurant" dish. The eggplant was thinly sliced, breaded and beautifully fried, but there was a strange absence of sauce. The same was true of the spaghetti - well prepared but under-sauced.  I had ordered a side of meatballs and was served a pair of huge ones - these were an unbelievable $3 - with adequate sauce. They were just the way I like them (you can stop snickering now), lots of bread crumbs mixed in to make them nice and tender. Ken had ordered a side of sausage, and that was excellent too. His lasagna was delicious. It was somehow light and substantial at the same time. The only disappointment was the Caesar salad. This was a ghost of a Caesar with an almost tasteless dressing that had never seen an anchovy.  Desserts are house made. We tried the chocolate mousse pie (it was called a cake, but really wasn't). It was good - you could actually tell it was chocolate. There's also a fried cannoli.  The espresso machine had broken down, so Ken can't report about that.       The prices are quite reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity, as befits a neighborhood restaurant.  My eggplant was $12.95, and Ken's lasagna $9.95. The most expensive dishes, veal picatta and marsala, and cioppino are $18.95. Fettucini Alfredo and Spaghetti Bolognese are $10.95. Service was excellent. Our waitress, Vanessa, recognized us from her stint at Gino's Restaurant, one of our favorites. And, you can get a Restaurant.Com certificate. What more could you want?        Actually, you could want a 4 course chef's dinner for $15. This is served on Thursday evening, and it's content changes every week. Call to see what's being prepared if you don't feel like taking a chance.       To past reviewers who complained about the bar next door, just park down at the end beyond the bar. As for the service - ask for Vanessa.

It's a really sad thing when the final meal of an outstanding vacation is a lousy one. We had spent a week in San Francisco, foodie nirvana, dining on Indonesian, Basque and Moroccan cuisines. On the last leg of our journey we reached Phoenix at about 1PM. We were tired, hungry, and hadn't been able to find the restaurant we were planning on going to, so as a default we ended up at Thee Pitts Again, a BBQ joint on Bell Road at about 57th Ave.        When Thee Pitts Again had first opened it had been pretty good, with a few out-of-the-ordinary entrees, like smoked turkey, available. Over the years, I felt it had gone down hill. This visit more than confirmed my opinion. The place was almost empty. We sat on the side usually reserved for groups (tables and chairs as opposed to booths). It felt like a nursing home dining room, trying to be kindergarten cheerful. I became more depressed by the minute.        We decided to share a slab of ribs - ordering potato salad and fresh fruit as our sides. Our dishes arrived almost instantly, really not a good sign. Especially since it looked like nursing home food. The ribs were on one plate, with pools of orange fat and a lone piece of decorative kale. They had a slightly off smell, but the taste was even worse. Either they had been reheated on a dirty grill, or they had spent a lot of time absorbing odors in the refrigerator (or both). YUCK. The potato salad had turned grey with age and was inedible. It matched my mood. The corn bread was served with margarine... What more can I say?       A few years ago Thee Pitts Again had made it onto the Food Network show Diners, Drive Ins & Dives. The chef/owner had won many prizes at BBQ cook-offs. Too bad there was no competitive spirit in the restaurant. It sure was a loser.

Expensive but tasty lunch. Bold, distinct flavors, nice plating. Handsome but noisy room.

It's 1961 and we're having lunch in the courtyard of our Miami Beach hotel. Parker House rolls, sweet and salty, an open-face meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy. There's a surf board and a tiki carving amidst the flowers. But wait - something's wrong!! There's no humidity! Those are imported mushrooms in my gravy! I work to orient myself in time and space and find, what a relief, that I'm actually in Cafe ZuZu in downtown Scottsdale and it's 2010.   The Valley Ho Resort, which houses the Cafe, is such a wonderful period piece. It opened in 1956 and was renovated in 2005 by a very wise design team that left the mid-century architecture and spirit intact. Cafe ZuZu is at the far end of the lobby, and its charming patio is surrounded with flowers. The decor is late 50's. If you're as old as we are, you'll recognize it instantly. The menu consists of "Flavorful American comfort food. Familiar favorites with a contemporary twist." There are goodies like warm Maytag blue cheese fondue ($7.50), truffled grilled cheese ($9), beef stroganoff ($17), and (gross) tuna salad with cottage cheese which brings me back to my childhood a little too clearly.   While waiting for our entrees, we received a basket of Parker House rolls. These are the nice squishy white bread treats that, if you can manage not to eat them all, make wonderful toys. You can mold them into sculptures, or shape them into little round beebees to shoot through your straw. My meatloaf sandwich ($11.25) was served on a thick piece of grilled white bread topped first with melty cheese, then the meatloaf, then the gravy. There was a mound of lumpless mashed potatoes alongside. They were so smooth Ken wondered if they were made from instant, but they tasted much too good for that. The portion was huge, I took half home (of course I knew I was going to have dessert). Ken had sauteed liver, beautifully prepared, atop a mound of kale that had been cooked with high quality bacon, sauced with a Madera reduction. He loved it. I surprised him by ordering a lemon meringue tart ($6) for us to share. There were several chocolate desserts that sounded good, but I had a vision of the mile high meringue toppings of my childhood. The tart had only modest swirls of meringue, but it had been made in such a way that it was creamy, as opposed to foamy, and it was really good.The lemon custard was the star. I remembered a gelatinous filling, but this was smooth and velvety, with just the right tart/sweet balance. The pastry was a cross between cookie and pie crust, and stood up well to the filling.   This was not an inexpensive meal, but the portions are large and quality is excellent. Plus we had joined an organization called The Lunch Club, which every weekday, emails it's members a discount coupon for a restaurant in their specified zip code. So one of our entrees was free! (The discount coupons differ, some are 20% off the bill, others merely are for a free drink). But, to pay Cafe ZuZu the ultimate compliment - I'd come here and pay full price.

I admit it. I'm a romantic. Sometimes I give my heart away too easily to a handsome french fry here, or a buff egg roll there, only to have it broken on our second meeting. The french fry has gone limp, the egg roll greasy. That's why I forced myself to hold back after going to Little Saigon the first time. I had to see how I'd feel on our next date. Now I'm ready.  The place is really cute. It's in one of the little houses that make up much of downtown Glendale's shopping district. You'd expect to be served Irish stew or corned beef and cabbage here. There are lace curtains in the windows and potted fake plants scattered about. But the food is Vietnamese, and lots of it, too. You can order by number, or enjoy feeling foolish trying to pronounce the Vietnamese names of the dishes correctly - all one hundred and one of them. So far we've tried eight.  The dish that first delighted us was #62, bo cuon la nho ($9.99), This, of course, is marinated beef wrapped in grape leaves and served with rice noodles and "paper". It comes, as do many of the dishes, with a large helping of fresh-as-can-be romaine lettuce leaves, mint, thai basil, coriander, and sliced carrots and cucumbers. It it looks like you're going to run out of greens, the pleasant servers (none of them Vietnamese) happily bring you more. The beef is tender and flavorful, contrasting nicely with the brininess and chew of the grape leaves. On our second visit,  Ken ordered #55, black peppered bite-size pork ribs with caramelized onions ($6.99). It was served in a pot which came boiling to the table. The broth was delectable, flavored by the onions, and the ribs were falling off the bone with just the right jolt of pepper.  I decided to order two appetizers - egg rolls ($4.99) and banh xeo ($7.99), which are rice flour crepes filled with pork, shrimp and bean sprouts. The egg rolls were good, but not noteworthy. The crepes were delicious. I've had them at other places and they usually arrive at the table soggy from the filling. These were perfectly dry and crisp, despite the load of meat and veggies. Our friend Sue, who was with us on our first visit and happily came on the second, had the fried rice bowl ($6.99) both times, so we plied her with our goodies. I bet the next time she'll go with the ribs.  There are 10 variations of Pho, with rice noodles, and 5 more soups made with egg noodles. Then there are 6 hot pot soups. Many dishes are served over rice, and others with stir fry noodles. Catfish is done 4 ways and shrimp 3. There are 3 green mussel salads and 5 mixed salads including one with jellyfish. I could go on, but if you go on line, you can see the menu for yourself.  As I mentioned above, the servers are friendly and attentive. They actually remembered our names and what we had eaten on our first visit. We had directed other friends to Little Saigon that night, and the servers remembered them, too. The portions are large, the ingredients fresh. And there's even a cute patio. I think I'm ready to commit.

It would be a real kindness if someone would come along and put Uncorked, "the unpretentious wine bar"  out of its misery. I think despondent would be a better word for it these days rather than unpretentious. It opened in the heyday of rising real estate values and hasn't changed a bit since. The prices are still high and the furnishings - untouched - are hitting a new low. But what has really bottomed out is the kitchen.  Four of us arrived for lunch at 12:30. The place was empty, and stayed so except for one other party of two. When we sat down, Ralph started to disappear under the table. The banquette had become unsprung. The laminate tabletop was peeling off in chunks. There was a sign on our table advertising summer specials. I'm wondering now why we stayed.  Ken and Ralph ordered the soup of the day ($ 5), which our waitress said was chicken and corn chowder. I asked for a pulled pork sandwich ($10) and mac & cheese($9), which I was going to share with Ken. Ralph also wanted the pulled pork, and Sandy ordered a chicken salad sandwich ($9). The sandwiches are served with a side of 5 grapes?!?!. A bag of chips cost an extra dollar. A side salad is an additional $2.50. Sandy asked for a salad with a sesame dressing. The dressing that was served was an unidentifiable oil mixed with a touch of sesame oil - no vinegar or seasoning. It was awful. When she asked to exchange it for honey vinaigrette, she was served something orange flavored instead. The chowder contained no milk or cream. The bread on Sandy's sandwich was inedibly stale. But the biggest gaffe of all was the pulled pork. Both sandwiches arrived at the table stone cold. Like just out of the refrigerator cold. The person in the kitchen, I wouldn't call him chef, couldn't even bring himself to put them in the microwave (which is a sin anyway). Ken, who is a bit of a conspiracy theorist, thinks that the kitchen staff is trying to sabotage the operation. Could be, except for letting a good mac & cheese slip out of the kitchen undetected, they're certainly succeeding.

I went to Hobe because I wanted a flank steak that was larger than the usual pound and a half specimens found in the grocery store, and although I know how to do it myself, I wanted to save myself the work and have it butterflied by the butcher. One of the men behind the counter didn't know the meaning of the term - I should have taken the hint then. But somebody in the back said that he would do it. Since it was given to me all wrapped up, I couldn't see how the butcher had butchered that piece of beef.  One third had been cut almost all the way through and was hanging by a tendon. The other two thirds hadn't been cut at all. I was forced to do that part of the process, plus find a way to patch up the severed piece. This was an expensive pain-in-the-flank.

The ambiance is great, industrial urban chic, unusual for Phoenix. But exposed brick, aluminum table tops, and concrete floor make it quite noisy.       We were there for late lunch, so we were seated right away. Service was pleasant but not terribly efficient. Entrees were not brought out all at one time, and drink refills were spotty. A requested side of bread and butter never arrived.       The lunch menu is tiny, but the items sounded interesting. The soup, celery root with apple puree was a winner. The romaine salad was nice and fresh and well dressed. Portions are large. However, our hamburger was disappointing. It was way too salty, but the french fries were even saltier. And it was expensive for what it was, $12 for a burger no better than Indulge or Blue Burger.       I'd be willing to go back and give dinner a try, but I understand that the wait is long, and the noise level excruciating. We'll see.

A few days ago my favorite restaurant blogger, Seth Chadwick, wrote about a dim sum place with a twist - no carts. Instead you check off items on a printed menu, much like those in many sushi places, with an accompanying page of photos of the various dishes. I thought this was a great idea since I've always been intimidated by the servers who push the cart up to your table and try to force unwanted dishes on you.  China Chan is at the Metro Center, a place we seldom go. The freestanding building is unprepossessing, to say the least, as is the interior. A few sad lanterns hang from the ceiling. That's about it for ambience. But the servers are very nice, and those who speak English are happy to make suggestions and give explanations of the various dishes. There are 28 dim sum dishes at $1.80 each including spareribs with black bean sauce, baked BBQ pork buns, and tripe with ginger and scallions. At $2.85 you can get steamed lotus flavor rice, pan fried rice noodles with dried shrimp, and 7 others. Next are those at $3.55; steamed shrimp filled rice noodles, beef tripe, chinese broccoli and shrimp roll steamed rice noodle. Finally, the chef's specials, eight of them, are priced from $5.99 to $8.50. From this last group we chose roast pork and roast duck. We also selected daikon cakes (I know these as turnip cakes) at $1.80. Lastly, from the regular menu we ordered eggplant in garlic sauce. Our waitress, licking her lips, suggested we add beef to the dish and that we pour lots of chili oil on top.   The roast pork and daikon arrived first. Chunks of moist, slowly roasted pork were generously sprinkled with the cracklings of skin. Decadent. And the portion was huge. The daikon cakes, three large rectangles enough to serve 6 as part of a meal, were the silkiest I've had, with just enough pan fry crust to satisfy. A small bowl of hoisin was served alongside. Then the duck and eggplant were served. The eggplant sauce was quite mild (our server was right about the chili oil) but beautifully flavored and the beef slices were a great addition. Again, the serving was huge. I don't recall how much this cost, but the dishes from the menu are remarkably low priced. The only thing not stellar was the roast duck. The skin wasn't crackly, and there was lots of fat.   Both menus contained dishes you don't often find, and there were lots of Asian diners, so China Chans felt like the real deal. I suggest you go there with lots of people so you can sample a great variety of dim sum. Give us a call - we're ready to go!!

It was raining. We had to get out of the house for a few hours.  It was lunch time.       So we decided to go down to Scottsdale Fashion Square, figuring there must be someplace to have lunch, we'd be out of the rain, and we could walk around for a while afterwards. However, it seemed to be a bad decision. The mall was mobbed, the food court gross, and the uninspiring restaurants near the food court had long lines. I was ready to leave, but Ken has more forbearance than I do, so we went up half a level, following a sign pointing toward Yard House and Grand Lux Cafe. Fortunately, the sidewalk led us to the Cafe, a place we had never noticed before.        We entered the imposing lobby, done up in black marble (faux?), with a nice display of desserts in a glass case. There was a short wait, during which we looked over the extensive menu. The dining area is cavernous, with high, high ceilings. There are lots of chandeliers, gilt moldings, and art deco touches. All very Vegas. But with an eerily Cheesecake Factory vibe about it, too. Actually, now that I think about it, Vegas is very Cheesecake Factory. And as it turns out, the creator of the Cheesecake Factory was commissioned by the owners of the Venetian Resort and Casino to create a casual, upscale restaurant for them. And, voila, the Grand Lux Cafe was born. There are now about 15 of them scattered around the country.       As you probably know by now, I'm not a big fan of corporate food, but there were some interesting items on the menu, it was still raining, and by now we were starving. We decided to share a cup of chicken/cream of mushroom soup. It was actually more like a bowl, a serving-size trend which was to continue. Beautifully seasoned and creamy, it came as a great surprise. But even better was the accompanying bread. Both the white and whole wheat slices had such crisp crusts that we were sending shards all over ourselves and the tablecloth when we broke the slices apart.        Within a reasonable time our sandwiches arrived. Mine was short rib, grilled cheese and carmelized onion. A sublime combination, and one that had never occurred to me. There was a little container of a sweet and sour salsa, which helped cut the richness of the sandwich. I had asked for my side of fries to be extra crispy, but there were none on the plate. The waitress brought them a minute or two later - they had obviously spent extra time in the fryer because they were perfectly cooked. They're at least as good as those at George's Gyros, and maybe even a little better. For me, that makes them the best in town. Ken went with short ribs, too, but in the form of a sloppy joe. It came in a large hot dog style bun that had been nicely grilled. Mild,sweet onions and a serving of mustard sauce (which was heavenly on the fries) were on the plate. Ken liked my sandwich a little better than his, but I thought they were pretty much equal. I believe my sandwich was $12, and Ken's was $10 - not bad for the quality and quantity.       As I said, the menu was quite large. I'll mention a few of the items which caught my eye. Appetizers: cheese steak springrolls, duck pot stickers. The Oven and Broiler section: chicken pot pie and Jamaican pork tenderloin. Pan and Grill: fried chicken, thai caramel chicken, jambalaya, and weiner schnitzel. Many of the desserts are baked to order and must be ordered at the beginning of your meal. There's molten chocolate cake (isn't there always?!), roasted pineapple upside down cake, beignets, and a few more. From the bakery come sticky bun bread pudding, banana cream pie, five kinds of cheesecake and chocolate layer cake. I could go on but you get the idea. I've left out lots of things on the menu, salads, pizzas, and a specialty cocktail of the day for $5 - you can see the whole thing on their website. Unfortunately the prices aren't listed there. The entrees seem to range from about $13 to the mid twenties. Not cheap, but not outrageous, and lots of things are share-able.       I'd happily go back, particularly if it's not raining. There's outdoor parking right near the door, so you don't have to set foot in the mall.

This entry is about D'Vine Bistro and Wine Bar in Chandler. I wish I was more competent with my word processor, because I'd like to divide the review into three columns: Very Successful, Adequate, and Giant Flop. I think it would mean more if you could see side-by-side comparisons, but you'll just have to try and visualize it.  I'll be nice and start with the Very Successful column.  (1)The menu: it's full of innovative selections. There are a number of Tapas, such as fried plantain cakes topped with grilled mango poke, seared pork belly, and a habanero vinaigrette ($8) and salmon cakes with chipotle molasses ($7). Many of the entrees come with interesting sides and sauces, for instance grilled pork tenderloin with a pan seared goat cheese polenta cake and roasted peppers, finished with a chipotle, espresso and raspberry BBQ sauce ($18). Which leads me to the Most Very Successful item of the evening. (2) Ken ordered one of the specials, a New Zealand farm-raised venison 2 rib chop with a juniper berry marinade, accompanied by spinach and roasted potato hash and the raspberry espresso BBQ sauce. Given how far the deer had to travel, the $32 price tag didn't seem too unreasonable. The chop was truly superb, moist and flavorful but not gamey. The sauce suited it perfectly. (3): portion sizes were quite generous. And (4): White anchovies were featured in several of the dishes.  That's it for the Very Successful.   On to Adequate. (1) The ambience is pleasant, if somewhat noisy. There's a bar, with a television above it, high top tables, and those of regular height. The paintings on the wall are for-sale originals, some good, some not-so. There is a patio (this will also appear in the Giant Flop column). (2); Our dessert selection of chocolate mousse cake was "corporate food", not made in-house, and nothing special, but certainly both edible and size-able. The coffee fell in this column, too. (3) The nicoise salad ($12) ordered by our friend Sena came with seared Ahi tuna rather than the canned variety packed in olive oil. This would have put it in the Very Successful category for me, but Sena likes the more traditional canned tuna.   OK. Here's the column you've probably been waiting for: Giant Flops. I'll start with (1) the above mentioned patio. The misters were on and it felt like London on a foggy morning. When we asked that they be turned off, nobody warned us that we would get dripped on, and our drinks would get dripped in. We soggily moved inside. (2) Sangria shouldn't be offered unless the proper ingredients are available. The white sangria ($5 at happy hour) given to us had a few slices of lemon in a poor quality wine. When we told our waitress that it was unacceptable she brought us a little carafe of "berry juice" to add to it. This made it even worse. (3) Nobody should ever put slices of cucumber in drinking water. While it may look stylish, after about 5 minutes it tastes really strange, and after 15 it's horrible. Imagine drinking it while eating chocolate mousse cake!! (4) My entree. I ordered one of the specials - fried chicken marinated in buttermilk, served with gouda mac & cheese, sauteed vegetables and a rainbow peppercorn gravy ($18). I asked for all dark meat, and my plate arrived with two huge chicken legs. I thought the coating was good, although the crispness of the coating was quickly lost to the gravy. The first few bites were quite good, the chicken was moist, with a pleasant taste. But then I noticed how pink the chicken meat was getting as I got closer to the bone, and it was actually almost raw in the center. The second leg, which I had given to Ken was somewhat smaller, and he said it was adequately cooked. The mac & cheese, if it had a flavor, was drowned out by the gravy which was cough-inducingly peppery. The sauteed vegetables consisted of a few strands of bell peppers.   When our bill arrived, $6 had been deducted from the price of my entree, and we had not been charged for the sangria (which we had not drunk).  As we were leaving the restaurant a woman whom I assume is the manager asked how our meal was. I politely listed some of our complaints and she seemed genuinely upset and was quite apologetic. While we were getting into the car she came out to the parking lot and gave us a gift certificate to use if we'd give D'Vine a second chance. Because of the items in the Very Successful column, I think we will. It's not every place that has pork belly, white anchovies and venison.

Bold flavors but terrible execution. The gnocchi were like little lead bombs and the fish had been cooked so long it was unrecognizable.

The more I think about it, the more enthusiastic I become about The Mission. We had lunch there yesterday since I wanted to try someplace new and I'd read good reviews. It's "new Latin" cuisine, brought to you by the people behind the successful Zinc Bistro, Matt Carter and Terri Ellisor.       The setting is lovely. It's housed in one of the outbuildings of the blindingly white old Mission Church in Old Town Scottsdale. You walk through an attractive fireplace'd patio and into the aroma of fire- grilled meats and romantic darkness (even at lunch). Unfortunately, you're assaulted by the background music which was very loud and distracting.  There's an interesting back-lit wall of orange and beige Himalayan salt blocks (actually I thought they were fake bricks until I read differently - gauche me). Lots of fancy chandeliers hang from the black ceiling, casting only a little light on the faux finished ochre walls and the somewhat crowded dark topped tables. Our server, Derek, added to the ambience - he was attractove, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Many of our south-of-the-border neighbors are represented on it: Mexico of course, Ecuador, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Uruguay, Cuba,and probably some I've missed.        I ordered a Cubano torta, one of my favorite grilled sandwiches with pork belly, smoked ham, swiss cheese, pickle, dijon and yucca ($12). The pork belly was meltingly tender.  Surprisingly, the torta did not come with a side, which struck me as pretty chintzy for the $12 price, but that was okay because I had to try the Creamy Grits ($8). Ken chose the Pabellon Arepas ($12). An arepa is a cross between a pancake and an english muffin. It's made out of a special pre-cooked corn meal, water and a little salt. First it's fried on a griddle, then it can be baked in the oven for a while where it rises a little and becomes less dense. It's then split, sometimes some of the interior is scooped out, and then it's filled with whatever delicacy strikes your fancy. In this case the arepa contained braised beef, peppers, black beans, cotija cheese, and fried plantains. So good. I spent an hour today googling arepas recipes and plan to go in search of the special corn meal tomorrow. The only disappointing (actually downright bad) thing on Ken's plate were the french fries, a mixture of white and sweet potatoes. They were supposed to have been sprinkled with lime and cumin, but they weren't, and also they were sadly limp. But OMG, the grits!!!! These were made with the addition of chipotle powder, butter, honey, and cotija cheese. They were on the spicy side, but the heat was moderated by the honey. The color was kind of a cross between pink and salmon (at least that's how it looked in the dim light), which made it even more interesting to eat. $8 for a good sized bowl which I proceeded to eat pretty much by myself as the grits were too spicy for everybody else (this was fortunate, because I really don't know if I would have been able to bring myself to share).       Our friend Ernest had a Skewered Grill Prawn Salad ($14), with arugula, yuzu vinaigrette, avocado, potato and orange sections. He said the prawns were nicely cooked but were somewhat too spicy for his taste. Anna ordered a chicken arepa ($12) with chorizo, corn, aji amarillo (the menu doesn't tell you, but this is a hot yellow chili pepper from South America - be warned), and Oaxaca cheese. While she didn't complain, I have the feeling she would have been happier without the pepper. The food here really isn't for the faint of heart (or heat). I don't know if the kitchen would be able or willing to tone it down for you, but it's worth asking.          But the desserts won everybody over. We tried the Pumpkin Bread Pudding ($6), which is composed of pumpkin bread, creme brulee, a butterscotch sauce loaded with Scotch, pepitas, and topped with Berto's cinnamon gelato. To die for, not to mention get drunk on. The Fried Bananas ($7) were terrific, too, served with butter, nutmeg, peanuts, and a dollop of peanut butter mousse.       Go on line to see the dinner menu. It's expensive, most of the entrees are in the $20+ range, but they sound fabulous. The Mission is, for me, one of the most exciting restaurants I've been to in a long time, and I'm grateful for it. But especially for the grits!

Don't be fooled by a pretty face. Every review I've read about Takeda Thai raves about the fancy facade and upscale interior of this small strip mall restaurant. I think belief is suspended at the door, as most reviewers go on to praise the food. Phoenix Magazine even rated it one of the 23 best new restaurants in its October issue. That actually is my reason for writing this entry - to give a dissenting view.  For lunch today, we ordered pad thai ($7.95 from the lunch menu, $13.95 at dinner), garlic mini pork ribs ($10.95) and angel wings ($11.95) from the appetizer section. Our very nice waitress brought us two bowls of soup instead of the one we were entitled to. It was a mild chicken soup with a few vegetables and some tofu floating in it. OK, certainly not notable. Then the rest of the dishes came out. I was truly shocked by the plate of riblets. There were 6 tiny riblets on a bed of wilted lettuce. Remember, these cost $10.95!!! They had been fried to death and had no garlic taste. I looked closely at the lettuce and noticed a few bits of overly browned garlic sprinkled on it. These clearly had never touched the ribs. This was downright insulting. The portion size of the angel wings was somewhat better. Angel wings are large chicken wings which have been boned and stuffed with vegetables, minced chicken and glass noodles, then fried and sliced. Like the riblets, these had been overcooked and were totally dried out. The insipid "sweet and sour chili dip" tasted only of sugar, and dunking the slices of wing in it did not revive them. Somehow the "chef" even managed to turn out dry pad thai with a horrible fishy back taste. When our waitress came over and asked which was our favorite thing, the only answer I could give was "the service". Our cost, even with a 10% discount coupon, came to $40.  I guess I could give the restaurant and its reviewers the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps since it was lunch time a talented chef was not on duty. However, if that's the case, and no one better than the person who was in the kitchen could be found, then lunch should not be served  The only review I read that got it even partly right was from AZ Central. It said "the kitchen assumes you don't want to play with fire, so everything here is mild enough to feed a newborn."  I hope you won't think I'm a grouch, but I did want to warn you.

The concept at Posh restaurant is "improvisational cuisine". I think of something improvised as being made up on the spot, done without preparation. What an exciting dining experience that would be, albeit fraught with danger for both the chef and the patrons. But don't go to Posh expecting that. The days menu is set long before you arrive and all you get to do is check off on a printed list what proteins you dislike so they won't be served to you. It's disconcerting to be asked to think about food you don't like at the beginning of a meal. Your other decision is how many courses you desire and if you want wine pairings: from $45 per person for 4 courses ($77 with wine) to $110/$165 for a full tasting, which is more than 7 courses.       Our meal started off promisingly. We shared a nice cocktail called a Cosmonade ($9) made with Hangar 1 Citron, Chambord, and lemon. An amuse bouche of papaya sorbet with mint "caviar" was delicious (this tiny spoonful doesn't count as a course).  My first course was an heirloom tomato salad with haricot vert and a few shavings of cheese. With something this simple  the ingredients need to shine, and these did not - the tomato, while ripe, had little flavor, and there was so little cheese it's impact on the dish was negligible. Ken's vichyssoise with chive oil was pleasant enough. For me, the fish course was sea bream with bok choy. The fish skin had been blasted with a propane torch which rendered it beautifully crispy. The Asian-y sauce on the vegetable was pretty salty, a harbinger of things to come. Ken received shrimp (they were called some fancy name) served with gnocchi, baby garlic, and a blastingly peppery aioli. The shrimp had been way overcooked, rendering them rubbery and tasteless.        On to the meat course. Mine was venison served on farro (which is an Italian whole grain), with a rhubarb gastrique. First I took a bite of meat - it was flavorful but tough. Then the farro. I gasped and almost choked. It was that salty. The insipid gastrique was totally overpowered by the other elements of the dish. Ken was kind enough to swap plates with me, and his braised short rib (hardly a seasonal dish) was at least edible, though also oversalted. Interestingly enough it was served with fingerling potatoes, making this the third dish in a row served to Ken that contained potatoes (assuming that the gnocchi had been made with them). When our waitress, cooly professional throughout, asked if we enjoyed this course, we mentioned the salt issue and she said she would inform the kitchen.       Finally, dessert. We were both given chocolate cake, cut into unattractive chunks. Mine topped with cubes of apricot, and Ken's with plum. Neither of these fruits complemented the cake, which contained a distractingly large amount of pepper. The drizzle of chocolate ganache was tasty. At this point we were seriously considering going to Crudo to have dessert since we needed a satisfying conclusion to the evening. Just then our server brought us a complimentary cheese plate, an apology for the salty food. That turned out to be the high point of our experience (along with the amuse bouche). The cheese selection was excellent, and the buttery grilled bread outstanding. But for $130 you'd expect more, wouldn't you?       I strongly suggest that if you want a an exceptional "tasting" experience you should visit Crudo Cafe. You even get to choose the foods you like to eat, not those you don't.

The one star is due to the fact that San Gabriel is now closed for a "concept makeover". The sign on the door doesn't say when it will reopen. I guess concepts are open-ended.      I had been really excited to try the build-your-own guacamole that was talked about in the Yelp newsletter. Oh well.

Outstanding food. We had beef shank, and goat stew. Both were fall-off the bone tender (Not an easy thing to do with goat), And both had delicious sauces. The gulpi (Cauliflower ) Was the best version of this dish I have ever had. All the staff were welcoming.  There's a buffet on Sundays which we will be back to try. For lovers of ethnic food this place is a must!!

Wonderfully al dente pasta with authentic Italian sauces. A very European feel all around, including the unisex bathroom.

Makes my soul sing! Fall-off-the-bone tender ribs, crispy fried chicken, amazing coleslaw. What more could you ask for but perfect pecan pie. And that's here too. All at a great price.

On entering Andrew's BBQ Restaurant in Tempe I was transported back to kindergarten, the happiest time in my childhood: hardwood chairs and tables, red floor, white walls covered with crayon drawings. I expected to see my teacher seated at her upright piano leading us in song. There was no piano, but Jody, event coordinator and restaurant manager, was as cheerful and informative as the teacher of my memories. I should have asked her to sing "I Am A Little Teapot" with me. Maybe next time.       A huge blackboard above the counter displayed the menu. The item that popped right out at us was Wisconsin Cheese Curds with Ranch Dressing ($4.95). We also ordered a BBQ Sampler Plate ($12.95) and a house-made cupcake ($2). Our food arrived quickly. Portions were large: the cheese curds could easily have fed four.  Our sampler plate consisted of 4 pork ribs, a container each of BBQ chopped chicken, beef brisket and pork. For our two sides we had selected baked potato salad and slaw. There was also a wedge of cornbread.        The cheese curds were out of this world, deep fried in a beer batter. Cheese curds are fresh young cheddar cheese in natural form before being processed into blocks and aged. They're mostly found in places that have cheese factories, since they should be eaten soon after being taken out of the vat  - but happily they've been showing up in the Valley. They're less chewy than mozzarella, with a lovely mild flavor. It's worth a trip to Andrew's just to have these!       The BBQ was excellent too. It's cooked over cherry wood imported from northern Michigan. All the chopped meats were moist and tender, served in their jus rather than slathered with BBQ sauce. Our only quibble was that the same rub seemed to have been used on all three, thus making their taste similar. The ribs were falling off the bone, but just this side of dry. There were two sauces, regular and spicy - not overly sweet or tomatoey. The baked potato salad was a treat, with bits of real bacon and scallions. One of the nicest surprises was that the moist, caky cornbread was served with real butter, and there were packets of honey on the table. We did pig-out on the cheese curds, so we finished only half of our platter. We took the cupcake home with us and had it as a mid-afternoon snack. From the many flavors available, we had chosen a chocolate-cherry. The pink frosting was topped with a maraschino cherry; while sweet it went nicely with the chocolate cupcake which was less sugary.       Other items I'd like to try:  Loaded Fries ($6.95) - Choice of BBQ Meats, Cheese, Onions & Ranch  BBQ Baker ($6.95) - Large baked spud loaded with cowboy beans, choice of BBQ meat, onions, sour cream and cheddar cheese. (Jody says this is HUGE)  Green Chili Mac & Cheese (one of the available sides) or $1.75.       Andrew's started out as a catering company, then added the restaurants (there's also one in Mesa) about a year and a half ago. They do catering for the Phoenix zoo and also private parties. If you happen to be having 100 people over to your house, for $13.95 per person you can get a whole smoked pineapple pig, injected with teriyaki pineapple juice, slow cooked for fourteen hours and hand carved at the buffet. Too bad our condo is so small....

We stopped into Kozy Cactus the other day for lunch. It's not one of our favorite places, but they have some interesting things on the menu, and they try hard to be "local" and organic. At least they used to. The menu we were handed had been cut in half and everything but bar food was gone. We asked the waitress what had happened, and she said that the management had changed but the name remained the same. Since we had our Restaurant.com coupon with us we decided to stay......not a great decision.  We ordered wings with sauce on the side, chili, onion rings and a patty melt. We waited and waited some more, and the place was not very busy. When our wings came they were slathered in sauce but we didn't want to send them back and risk waiting another half hour. Silly us, the sauce was awful!! It seemed to be a mixture of marinara and bbq, to the detriment of each. Too bad because the wings themselves were decent. Ken said the chili recipe was totally changed - it had no seasoning other than "hot". No onions or cheese were offered with it and our waitress was too busy chatting to come to our table for a request. The onion rings were dripping with grease, and like the hamburger, way too salty.  There are bars that serve way better food at much lower prices. I suggest you find one. And don't be fooled by the name. Like I said, it ain't Kozy anymore.

Tremendously good. And a tremendous deal. Located near the corner of Greenway and 19th Ave., a bad luck spot formerly housing Lenny's Burgers and several other restaurants, Tiny's Country Cafe should turn that bad luck around. This is a family business, run by mom "Tiny" and her daughters. They have a long history in the Phoenix restaurant business starting with The Famous Restaurant on Dunlap, back in the 60's.       Decorated in country style, with red check plastic tablecloths, lots of down home pictures and hand-lettered signs, a menagerie greets you as you enter. The day's specials are posted on the walls, but there's a menu too. We were there for lunch, so we ordered "Family Favorites" fried chicken ($8.99 for a half), and meatloaf ($7.49). These came with soup or salad, real mashed potatoes or fries, vegetables, and a roll or homemade corn bread. Ken enjoyed a cup of three bean soup, loaded with beans and very flavorful. My salad was nice and fresh, topped with green peppers, tomatoes, and, a nice touch, scallions. The cornbread was delicious. Somehow it managed to be both moist and crumbly. Too bad it was served with Country Crock margarine. Both the fried chicken and the french fries were greaseless and perfectly cooked - and there was a light hand on the salt shaker. Ken would have preferred bigger pieces of chicken, but I like the small ones because of the ratio of skin to meat (more crunchy skin), and because often the bigger pieces are bloody near the bone. I found the meatloaf somewhat strange: it had a texture that reminded me of corned beef hash. Not necessarily a bad thing, but the bottom of the slices had been burned on the griddle.       Other offerings on the lunch menu include pork chops ($8.99), chicken fried steak ($7.75), sloppy joe ($5.99) and a variety of sandwiches and burgers and salads. But the real treat here is dessert. I've never been able to figure out why people like strawberry pie - now I know! The flavor of the berries shone through the not too sweet glaze, and the crust was delicious. But we were told that the coconut custard and peanut butter pies are even better. Oddly, rice pudding, at around $3.75 was more expensive than the pie.        We're planning to try breakfast sometime soon. The biscuits and gravy are prize winners. Egg dishes are served with either hash browns or grits. There's a dish called "hog wild" which is two pork chops, two eggs, and two biscuits covered with country gravy ($8.25). I've heard of milk toast, but have never seen it on a menu until now. It's three slices of buttered, sugared toast with hot milk poured over it ($2.50). Odd. You can get a plate of hash browns topped with fried onions, cheese and sour cream. I can relate to that.       So come to the country for breakfast or lunch, seven days a week, from 6 AM - 2 PM.

On at least four or five occasions we've tried to go to The Parlor, a former beauty salon turned upscale pizza restaurant, but there has always been a long wait to get seated. Given that, and it's consistently good reviews, we made a plan to eat a late breakfast so we could hold off having lunch until 3PM, figuring this was way past lunchtime but too early for happy hour. We were right, there were only a few cars in the lot - we were really excited and had high expectations of a delicious meal. Whoever was responsible for the renovation did a fabulous job. There's lots of exposed brick, wood, glass bricks, and a cute little patio. At the bar there are some salon-type chairs: I don't know how comfortable they'd be for cocktail sipping, but they're a witty touch. My favorite part of the decor is the planters lined up along the path to the door. They're filled with fresh herbs and tomato plants. We were even more convinced that we'd have a great meal. And our server didn't let us down either (service has been the major negative in most of the reviews). He was pleasant and helpful.       We started off with a roasted beet and avocado salad ($9.75). The colors of the golden beets and mellow green of the avocados made for a beautiful plate, and the walnut crusted goat cheese was the perfect foil. While a little on the expensive side, we felt it was worth it. We couldn't wait to dig into the pizza!!       According to the menu, the Smokey pizza ($14 for a 12") is topped with speck (smoked prosciutto), olive tapenade, ricotta, and fresh arugula. Sounds good, doesn't it? It arrived at the table heaped with arugula, with a few pieces of speck on top. I think they put so much arugula on the pie so you couldn't see the paucity of the other ingredients. The only taste that stood out, overpowering even the arugula, was the tomato sauce. OMG, it transported me instantly to my high school cafeteria - and that's not a good place for me to be !!!  Do you remember those thick slices of bready dough topped with a thin, tinny tasting sauce? Aaggh, get me out of there !!! At least at The Parlor the crust was thin, but it was limp as a noodle, and tasteless. I actually, for the first time in living memory, didn't take home the leftovers. That's how bad it was.       I wouldn't tell you not to go here. The Parlor is a pretty place, and the salad was outstanding, but I wish you good luck with the pizza.

The dining gods were kind today, At lunchtime they led us to La Mirage, a Mediterranean restaurant in the almost deserted Bell Canyon Shopping Center near Rt. 17. On entering, you're in for a surprise - a stage set up for musical entertainment, a dance floor, catering style cloth-covered dining tables with upholstered barrel chairs on wheels. And not a customer in sight.  The extensive menu is a combination of familiar Greek dishes, more exotic Lebanese ones, and a great many dishes I had never heard of (which made me very happy). The owner is Arab, so perhaps that's what these dishes are. There are many combination plates and family platters. You can even get a whole lamb with rice (called Quzy) for $225.  We ordered the deluxe appetizer platter ($13.95) which came with stuffed grape leaves (served hot), falafel, a large plate of hummus, and fattoush, a salad with pieces of fried pita bread. This was more than enough for a meal, but we had also ordered an entree of Shish Kafta ($13.95), skewered ground beef with onions and parsley. The two skewers were accompanied by a mound of fluffy rice and a pile of raw chopped onions coated with sumac, a spice not used enough in restaurants in the U.S. A bowl of lentil soup came with the entree, and it was delicious, as were all the various dishes. Our very nice waitress also supplied us with a bowl of curry potato stew because the sauce goes well on the rice.  Here's a list of some of appetizers and entrees. I hope it whets your appetite and curiosity: Quail, Foul Mdmass, Bajilla, Kibbe done three ways, lamb chops, kabobs and shawarma, chicken cream chops, ghallaba, lablabee, fruit smoothies.  If you go to the website you can check out La Mirage's menu, and also their entertainment schedule. There are card games on Sunday and Wednesday evenings, belly dancing on Saturdays, and Latin and Salsa dancing on Thursdays.  This is another place that's barely managing to hang on. So if you feel like having a Middle Eastern meal, safe or adventurous, please give them a try.

On Friday night we had dinner at Tommy V's Osteria Pizzeria, across from the Biltmore Fashion Park at 32nd St. and Camelback. It's a relatively new spin-off of Tomaso's Restaurant which has been at that location for 32 years. Where Tomaso's is upscale, dressier, and heavy on the proteins, Tommy V is casual and carb-oriented. It's interesting that the prices on most of the appetizers, salads and pastas are pretty much the same at both locations.       Tommy V's is divided up into two rooms. You enter the bar area which also houses an open kitchen with wood burning pizza oven. It's light-filled and colorful. and also very loud. The second room is more sedate, and unfortunately somewhat gloomy. It's dimly lit, and the faux brick, dark wood, and taupe painted walls don't help. There are some windows cut into the front and back walls, framed with curtains, which look into the bar area, and a third back room. Very weird. However, the gloom was dispelled when our cheerful waitress brought us a basket of crusty bread and some fabulous pesto butter, redolent of garlic. She informed us that happy hour was on (from 5 - 7), and we could get most of the wines on the menu for $5 a glass or $20 a bottle. We decided to share a glass of red Primitivo 'Layer Cake' (I don't know why it was called that, but you knew that I wouldn't be able to resist ordering it). It turned out to be delicious, rich and deeply fruity. Because we had arrived quite early - I didn't know how busy the restaurant would be and reservations are only taken for tables of 6 - we ordered a roasted beet and goat cheese salad ($8) while we awaited our friends Walt and Maria. While it was quite good, it didn't live up to the one we had at The Parlor since the beets weren't multi-colored and the dressing didn't have as much zing. However, there was lots of cheese and toasted pistachios.       When Walt and Maria arrived, our bread basket and carafe of butter was swiftly refilled (the bussing was top notch). I suggested that they try the Primitivo, and they ordered the Romaine Wedge salad ($7) with bacon and gorgonzola. It was beautifully presented, with a pile of whole romaine leaves holding the accompaniments and dressing. All the salad ingredients were quite fresh. I ordered an Eggplant Torta ($15), described as "Baked Multi-layer of Eggplant, Cheese Fondue, Pasta". Ken opted for V's Kick Ass Burger 9 oz ($12) - "Handcrafted with Short Rib, Brisket & Kobe Beef, Caramelized Onions, Heirloom Tomatoes, Bacon, Blue Cheese, Arugula, Truffle Aioli & Parmesan Herb Roasted Potatoes". The combination of meats made this too interesting to pass up. Walt and Maria decided to share a pizza. These are "personal size", 10 - 12 inches, and range in price from $10 for a Margherita with mozzarella and tomatoes to  $16 for a Proscuitto and Fig pie with gorgonzola and arugula. Unfortunately I don't remember what kind they had, but they said they enjoyed it, and it was actually big enough that 2 pieces were taken home. The burger was great. It was big and juicy with a fascinating texture because of the short ribs and brisket - it's now my favorite Phoenix burger, and the price is comparable to the other good ones served elsewhere. Ken loved the roasted potatoes, and while they were flavorful, I prefer nice crunchy fries. My eggplant torta was a pleasant, non-confrontational variant of eggplant parmesan. But having taken a Zantac, I was looking forward to confrontation - a spicy sauce and loads of gooey cheese. This was disappointing, but edible. It was also a fairy small portion.       There were no surprises on the dessert menu - tiramisu, cannoli, etc. We ordered a tartufo for the table. When it arrived, nicely sliced, there was none of the zablione promised on the menu. I asked the waitress about that and she tried to tell me that it had been "mixed in". When I gave her a skeptical, unhappy look she brought over the owner/manager (I'm not sure which he was), and he apologized, saying that there's been a dispute with the distributor over that item. We weren't charged for it, which was very nice, since we did eat it all.       The parking in front of the restaurant is limited, but Walt said to tell you that immediately to the east of the strip mall containing the restaurant there's a large parking lot, not particularly visible to the street. All in all I'd say this was a good dining experience and we'll go back to try some of the interesting pastas like braised short rib gnocchi ($20) or butternut squash ravioli with amaretto cookies, toasted almonds and parmigiano sage sauce ($15). And especially to have another burger!!

Notorious Porker Ingesting Groupie. It sounds like some kind of bad sci-fi movie, doesn't it? Actually it's what my overactive imagination came up with on hearing that the Notorious P.I.G All American BBQ  didn't have any words to go with the P.I.G. acronym. I thought they should have a contest and whoever came up with the best name would win a free dinner. So that's my entry.  The Notorious P.I.G is a new BBQ restaurant on the corner of Thunderbird and 32nd St. where Carmella's Italian Restaurant used to be. Now that Carmella's talented former chef is cooking at Gino's (see below) this is an even better use for the building. The interior hasn't changed a lot, in fact they still have the same uncomfortable chairs (new ones are on the way), but the simplicity works well for a BBQ joint. For sports fans there are two flat screen TVs in the dining room, and more in the busy bar. It was a little past lunch time and the dining room was almost empty so we had lots of time to talk with our server, Torry. He moved to Phoenix a few weeks ago from Cincinnati, and this is his first restaurant job. We really enjoyed his enthusiasm. Ken asked a question about the chili, and Torry got a sample from the kitchen (with two spoons - smart man). When I said I had heard that the hushpuppies were overly seasoned with cayenne pepper, he went back again to make sure I could get some that would be to my liking. He checked in on us frequently, and later brought other staff members over to meet us.   Before our entrees, we were served a little loaf of piping hot, sweet cornbread, still in the dish in which it had been cooked. It was accompanied by honey butter. I was already being won over.  There are three kinds of BBQ sauce - a mild tomato based one, the mild kind spiced up with pepper (I combined these two to make a slightly hot sauce), and a North Carolina mustard based sauce that captured Ken's heart. I "ingested" a pulled pork sandwich ($8.99) topped with delicious coleslaw that had a blue cheese dressing. The pork, nicely moist and flavorful, combined with the slaw (I would have liked a little more of it on my sandwich) and a decent roll was very satisfying. One side comes with the sandwiches, so I chose the hushpuppies. There wasn't a trace of cayenne, which I appreciated, but they were a little lacking in corn flavor. The texture, however, was fabulous, they were so light they were almost airborne.  Ken had ribs and beef brisket ($16.99). Be forewarned - the ribs are dry cooked, not falling off the bone and swimming in sauce. The dry rub was nicely balanced and the meat was perfectly tender, as was the brisket. The mac & cheese side needed a slight flavor nudge. We suggested adding truffle oil.  We were too full for dessert, but Torry told us that there are several homemade pies ($3.99 including pecan and sweet potato), cobblers, and cookie sundaes (both $4.99).  Get this - on January 29 (I think that's the correct date) there's going to be a FREE pig-pickin'. You can bet this Notorious Porker Ingesting Groupies will be there.

You'd think, wouldn't you, that with a name like Hillside Spot this restaurant in Ahwatukee would be nestled in a pastoral setting with lovely views? Not so, it's in a typical strip mall off Warner Rd. and unfortunately its patio faces directly on the street, making it hard to carry on a conversation, even on a Sunday. The patio, without misters, is uninviting, with a very odd mixture of seat cushions for the wrought iron furniture. It was even more off-putting because most of the tables were loaded with dirty dishes. There was one hard working busboy who couldn't keep up with the mess. It wasn't much better indoors - messy and noisy (the noise of the cars being replaced by very loud music).       You place your order at the counter. Breakfast is served daily from 6:30 AM to 4 PM. There are pancakes, plain or with apple compote ($6) or with bananas, caramel, creme fraiche and peanuts ($7).  Eggs, scrambled or fried, come with MJ toast and a choice of bacon, ham, sausage, or chorizo ($6).  Various egg sandwiches and omelets range from $6 to $8. But we had come for lunch. The selection was small, and not particularly inspiring. Tuna or chicken salad sandwiches ($7), turkey ($6), a BLT to which you could add a fried egg at no extra charge ($7) and a croque monsieur ($7.50). Surprisingly, none of these came with a side. The cheeseburger ($8.50) came with fries.       I ordered the rotisserie half chicken ($10) which was served with fries and seasonal local vegetables. Of course, I requested crispy fries. Ken opted for the Derby Salad, with various greens, egg, avocado, bacon, and blue cheese, served with house made buttermilk dressing ($8). We waited quite a while, when finally a server, shouting our name and number, delivered our food. The salad was good size, with loads of blue cheese chunks of good quality (rather than the generic crumbles served at many places), and large pieces of bacon. The greens were fresh and the avocado looked freshly cubed. It's a shame that the buttermilk dressing was tasteless, and the quantity skimpy. My chicken was nicely cooked, with crisp skin - much crispier, in fact, than my fries which were dark brown, but limp. The vegetables were a mix of roasted cauliflowerets, corn, and red peppers which I enjoyed.  We took home a brownie and a slice of chocolate cake. Both were excellent.       All in all, although our food was generally good, I had expected more. More ambience, a nicer setting, a more interesting menu. One of the owners of Hillside Spot also owns Gallo Blanco, a Southwestern/Mexican restaurant (our favorite) in the Clarendon Hotel in downtown Phoenix,. That menu, while small, is full of interesting, flavorful food. The place is clean, the decor "bus station" funky. It is, however, LOUD, especially when the Flamenco dancers are in attendance. Unfortunately, the limp fries are there too. So, while we will continue to eat at Gallo Blanco, Hillside Spot is off limits for us.

Andre, the owner of Off Da Hook Soul Food Restaurant, is a true foodie. When he noticed that the fried chicken breast on my plate might be a little dry, he cooked up a new one for me. His goal is to serve the same quality food in his restaurant that he'd want to eat at home. He can invite me there anytime.      We each ordered a plate: smothered pork chops ($10.50) for Ken and fried chicken ($9.50) for me. Each came with two sides, so we opted for mac and cheese, cabbage, greens, and yams (all the sides are $4 if ordered a la carte), and corn bread. Since it was busy, Andre gave us some corn bread to "keep us busy". It was burn-the-fingers hot. Whether it got that way in the microwave I don't know, because it was so buttery-sweet-good it got eaten before it could change texture. The chicken was delicious, with a light peppery crust and moist meat. The two pork chops on Ken's plate were huge, and to use Ken's word, "astounding". They had also been breaded and fried, but they remained succulent. All the sides were outstanding, to a great extent because they're not loaded with salt. The cabbage was nice and sweet, and the mac and cheese gooey and rich (although I have to say that Bobby Q is still has my #1). The yams were fabulous - in a nice, lightly spiced syrup, they could have been dessert. Since the portions are more than generous, we took home a piece of sweet potato pie ($3). I'm glad that we hadn't tried it at the end of our meal as it was disappointing. The filling was one-dimensional and the crust unpleasant. Hopefully the peach cobbler or red velvet cake are better.       There are lots more things on the menu I'd like to try. I'm not sure Ken will ever be able to get beyond the pork chops. Ribs, meatloaf, fried shrimp, and oxtails. Some of Andre's family is from Louisiana, so there's gumbo and red beans and rice. Catfish and red snapper. You can even get baked chicken - but why would you?      The restaurant is small, with an active take-out business. It's clean, tables get bussed quickly, and everybody is friendly. In fact, we spent a pleasant half hour talking food with Andre. There's another location at the swap meet at 5115 N. 27th Ave.

I was awakened from my foodie revery of perfectly seasoned babaganooj on home-made bread by an eerie orgasmic humming. I looked up and saw Ken, his eyes glazed over, humming to his glass of iced Turkish coffee, a delight of his own creation. When Tony, the owner (along with his wife Juliette) came over to investigate, he decided he had to have one too.       This took place at Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill in North Phoenix. Unlike most small groceries, Olive Tree is bright, clean and cheerful. The shelves are stocked with fascinating Middle Eastern delights - jars of olives and tahini, an interesting assortment of cheeses, sweet treats that I'd never seen before. You order at the counter    from a good size selection of ethnic dishes, plus a few typical American items. Food is then brought to your table in a sectioned off area.       I had discovered Olive Tree on Restaurant.com. Since we had to order $35 of food from the menu, we ended up with quite an array of dishes. Now that I think of it, the humming started with the above-mentioned baba. This roasted, pureed eggplant concoction is found in most Middle Eastern restaurants, with varying results. It can be very flat tasting if too much tahini (sesame paste) is mixed in, or it may be over-spiced. This baba was beautiful, with all the tastes dancing in our mouths. Julliette makes her own bread to go with it. The texture is very different from pita (even the pita served here was selected with great care), crustier and chewy. A special of the day was stuffed cabbage. About the same size and shape as the stuffed grape leaves (which were delicious), these are lighter and lemony good - a real treat. We shared a combination kebab plate with chicken, kefta, and shish-kebab skewers. This paled in comparison to the other dishes, since the meat was on the dry side. The baklava was quite good, it wasn't soggy with syrup, so the layers of phyllo dough made a satisfyingly crunchy noise.      After lunch we did a little shopping. We got some delicious feta cheese and something called Chicago cheese, which reminded me of mozzarella. I could have bought more, but Ken wisely herded me out the door.

Thanks to Restaurant.com we discovered Il Poggio d'Italia which is tucked away inside the Pima Crossing shopping center on Shea just west of the 101. In it's last incarnation it was Shanghai China, an overly decorated place with boring food . This time the decor suits the cuisine. Owner/chef Tom Giresi serves up sophisticated southern Italian dishes at surprisingly reasonable prices (it's a steal if you have a Restaurant.com coupon).  This is a place with tablecloths and an excellent wine list. There's lots of wood and stone, which is attractive but noisy. And a well-dressed Scottsdale crowd - shame on us, we were in our T-shirts and jeans. For a Thursday night, the restaurant was hopping. We were immediately served a pleasingly plated dish with sliced baguette, butter, and some caponata. The eggplant spread was less assertively tomatoey than usual and had pine nuts and raisins - delicious. We perused the menu and were surprised to find dishes like tripe and pig skin bracciole. So many things caught our attention that we decided to graze. Happily, our friend Pat was along, so we were able to order a larger than usual selection.  Pat chose the stuffed mushrooms, 5 for $4 or 10 for $8. The sausage/breadcrumb/cheese stuffing was tasty, and the mushrooms properly cooked. We couldn't resist trying the pig skin bracciole ($6). It's stuffing was, again, excellent, and the pig skin was succulent - maybe too succulent. I enjoyed my first piece, but couldn't bring myself to have another, it was that rich. The marinara sauce spooned on top was light and flavorful, and also went well atop our order of polenta ($6). The polenta had been cooked and allowed to cool so that it could be cut into bars and sauteed, yielding a nice crust. Our "individual" order of broccoli rabe ($4 - as opposed to the family size for $12) was enough for the three of us to share. It was toothsome, with a nice lemon/garlic flavor. I'm pleased to say that none of our dishes were over-salted. Perhaps the thing that pleased Ken and me the most was that anchovies were available, at no extra charge, for our Caesar salad, and they gave us lots! The dressing was a little on the light side for my taste, but pleasant.  I regret that I can't tell you about the entrees, but they sounded good, and there seems to be enough variety to please everybody. There were 3 soups, and 9 pastas which ranged in price from $14 to $21). Steaks and lamb ($20 - $25), lots of chicken dishes, a veal parmigiana ($18), shrimp scampi ($20) and salmon ($17) are waiting for your approval. The only offerings that struck me as mundane were the desserts: cheesecake,   ice cream, tartuffo and the ubiquitous cannoli and tiramisu.  Guess how much we paid, including tip, using our coupon - $26 !!!!

If  you kiss enough princes, and you're very lucky, one of them might just turn into a satisfied frog. Good fortune has smiled on us - if you go to 2827 E. Bell Rd. in Phoenix, you'll find one there. Crazy Ed's Satisfied Frog (a.k.a. The Little Frog on Bell) opened last night.   This is the home of my favorite fried chicken, and some mighty good ribs, beef and pork. The original Satisfied Frog lived up in Cave Creek in Frontier Town. He'd been around since 1981, and his demise came amidst a swirl of controversy, about two years ago. Crazy Ed and his wife Maria kept in touch with the faithful by e-mail, and he continued to sell his "world famous" Cave Creek Chili Beer on line. Then came the news that he was planning a come-back, and we hung on his every communication. Last night was our reward.   The new Frog is much smaller than its predecessor, but much cuter. There are rustic wood chairs and red tablecloths. Terrific lantern light fixtures, and for those who can't do without, 12 TV screens. And the food is even better!! Our chicken ($14.99, enough for two) had crackly good skin, the fries were just the way I like them (you know, nice and crisp). A house salad was included, unlike at the old Frog. The price for this dinner was $3 less than previously. For dessert we had our old favorite, strawberry shortcake ($6.99, again, enough for two). The quality of the ice cream has been upgraded, and nice biscuits sop up the syrup, instead of cake which used to get soggy. This was $2 less expensive.   In fact, all the prices are quite reasonable. The meats, which all come from Harris Ranch and are organic and hormone free, range in price from $6.99 for a ground-fresh burger, to $18.99 for a full rack of St. Louis ribs. All-you-can-eat beef ribs (boy, did they smell good!) are available daily for $10.99. There's pulled pork and brisket, and fish and chips ($9.99 for a basket and $12.99 for a platter). A new item on the menu is cream of green chili soup ($6.99), described as heavy cream blended with mild green chiles and butter, then topped with croutons and cheese. I've got to try that next time. There's lots more on the menu, which you can find on line.   I think I'll go find some more princes to kiss and see what pops up next.

If you're in the mood for a foodie adventure, I've got just the thing. A trip to the Caribbean! Head on over to Tempe and enter A Taste of the Caribbean restaurant. The bright yellow and green walls, red floor and outdoor furniture will make you feel like you've arrived. It's kind of scruffy and laid back - this is not the place to come for a quick bite. First of all, you have to make the tough decision about what to order. Oxtails or goat? Jerk chicken, of course, or do you want the milder brown stew chicken? Fish? There's snapper, tilapia, and shrimp. The menu is divided up into Caribbean Favorites, Friday and Saturday Menu, Lunch Specials, Rice Bowl Specials and Plate Specials. If all this has your head spinning, you're not alone. Our server, part of the family who own and run the place, seemed equally confused. But she was charming. Just accept it, and the slow service as part of the experience - don't worry, be happy.       We ordered oxtails ($11.95) and Eggplant Curry Shrimp ($9.95). The oxtails, in a brown sauce, were fall-off-the-bone tender, fatty, as oxtails are, and totally delicious. The accompanying plantains were caramelized and a little crunchy. Perfection. A huge mound of rice and peas filled the center of the plate - moist and beautifully seasoned. And finally, a side of cabbage. There must have been a little sugar in the cooking pan, because it was sinfully delicious. Served on the side was a basket of roti, a homemade flatbread, similar to a flour tortilla but much softer. It was so hot we burned our fingers trying to pull off a piece. We had finished off the oxtails when the eggplant dish arrived (they were supposed to have come out together - it's a good thing we like to share). Be forewarned, this curry is not for the faint-of-mouth. I wasn't expecting the degree of heat - my nose started running and my eyes watered. But it was pure bliss, with flavor layered on flavor. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, although I wouldn't have minded a few more, and the eggplant was so tender it was almost melting into the gravy. There were also some pieces of potato, which had not been mentioned on the menu, hiding in there. The heap of rice and peas helped mitigate some of the heat. As you might have gathered, between the roti, the plantains, the rice and peas,and the potatoes, this is a carb-lovers paradise.       Two odd things: a wide variety of Caribbean sodas are sold here, but no ice tea. And the rest rooms are in a different building than the restaurant.       The only disappointment was dessert. I got a pineapple tart to take home (I couldn't have eaten another carb if my life depended on it). Our server had said it was the best of the two desserts available. Uh-oh. The tart was really bad - a smidgen of decent pineapple filling wedged between layers of leaden dough, tough and greasy. I was glad I hadn't eaten it at the restaurant, because it would have put a bad ending onto an otherwise extraordinary meal.

How fortunate we are that  Stefano Fabbri, owner of the new Pomo Pizzeria in the Borgata, is a pizza fanatic. He is obsessed with the authenticity of his Napoletana style pizza - so much so that  his restaurant will be vetted by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana at the end of the month. There's a lengthy set of rules to be followed: specific imported tomatoes and cheeses, the proper kind of flour, the dough must be shaped to a certain size (12 -14 inches) and thickness after a particular rising time. You get the idea. Fabbri has an imported wood burning brick pizza oven that heats to a blistering 950 degrees and cooks the pizza in 90 seconds. It's smoking hot coming out of the oven, which gives the toppings time to meld to perfection.        There's something you have to understand and be open to experiencing in this crust. It's thin and light as a feather, but what most of us are not used to is that it's slightly moist in the center, not crispy. That's because one of the above rules says that the crust must be foldable. Stefano says that after you've tried it two or three times, even die-hard crispers will be converted I say that it's possible to enjoy both crusts. The one concession made to American tastes is in the variety of toppings. Traditionally the pie is made only with tomato, oregano or basil, mozzarella di bufala, garlic and oil, but 17 varieties of pie are offered here - though for sure you won't find pineapple and Canadian bacon. Also available are some appetizers and salads. We had an antipasti platter with meats and cheeses, sliced on an imported hand-cranked slicer. I learned that if an electric slicer is used the blade becomes hot enough to start to cook the prosciutto. There's a soup and pasta of the day, five paninis, and some amazing desserts made in-house daily by a well-known local pastry chef.       Pomo occupies the space formerly used by Thai Thai. It's done up simply in dark browns and white, with a floor to ceiling mural of Naples on the back wall. The bar, with a selection of Italian wines, and the open kitchen takes up about a third of the space, while banquettes, tables and chairs (somewhat crowded together in European fashion) uses the rest. Patio dining is available. Our server was delightful and efficient although I have read some complaints about the service at peak hours. This is not a restaurant for the faint-of-wallet. Our antipasto, pizza, and molten lava cake came to about $40 without tax or tip. But believe me, it was worth every penny. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY THIS PLACE. Like I said, pizza rules!!

I know a lot of you will disagree with me, but I have to be honest with you, I've never been a fan of Sam Fox Concept restaurants, mostly because the emphasis is on the concept, not the food. And they tend to be outrageously expensive. The exceptions are Sauce, which in my opinion serves insipid food, the Counter (it's 25 cent coffee was the deal of the decade) and the new Zinburger.       Of course, Zinburger is easy on the eyes, with it's huge mural of happy cows, and it's lighthearted use of chartreuse accents. Given that it's in the the Biltmore Fashion Park,  $8-14 for various types of burgers isn't bad - and they're big enough to share. Sides of french fries, fried zucchini, etc. are $3-5, and salads range from $9-14. There are lots of milkshakes and floats at around $6. The trouble, as I see it, is that you can get better for  less bucks at Indulge or BluBurger (particularly if you use a coupon). DeLux is a little less expensive, with a lot more food options, although the ambience isn't as pleasant. I won't bore you with what we ate, suffice to say it was merely okay.       My favorite thing is the irony. Zinburger, with it's emphasis on meat, sits a few doors down from Sam Fox's Tru, which specializes in being vegetarian and vegan friendly.

I know why the people behind Big Daddy's BBQ (the Maestro group, formerly of Maestro's Steak House and the Ocean Club) named it that. It's because they see hundreds of baby Big Daddy franchises spinning off this papa. And, sadly, they're probably right. This is BBQ for the unadventurous, for those who don't appreciate the glorious idiosyncrasies of the genre. As Olive Garden is to Italian, and Red Lobster to seafood, Big Daddy's is to BBQ.       Located on the west side of the Pima Crossing Shopping  on Shea Blvd. at the 101, you'll have to walk a ways after you've parked. The ambiance is kind of fun. There's a big mural of the Budweiser wagon on a brick side-wall. Several garage doors open to the picnic-tabled patio, and there are more picnic tables with umbrellas inside, as well as stainless steel topped tables. Paper towels are on each table as well as a rib bucket. I get the feeling the bucket is strictly for show and an alarm would go off if anyone dared to dirty one. As you enter you'll see the menu on the wall. No selection is over $20. Decide what you want and proceed to the counter to order. Then you pay and will be given one of those annoying vibrating, flashing light things that let you know it's time to pick up your order. It will be ready surprisingly quickly. This is a VERY bad thing at a BBQ restaurant.       Ken and I shared a 3 meat combo (the menu on line says $13.95, but I think we paid more) with 2 sides and a piece of cornbread. The most exciting thing on the list of sides was creamed corn, which we ordered, along with coleslaw. Our platter contained one beef rib, three pork ribs, and about 5 slices of brisket which had a small amount of BBQ sauce on top. There is more sauce available on the counter with the drink machine, but there's no selection - it's the only one. Neither spicy nor sweet - just blah. All the meats were quite dry, and somehow they all tasted the same. We were wishing for a pepper shaker when we tried the coleslaw. It was totally bland, as was the creamed corn, which had a bizarrely large amount of flavorless white sauce to canned corn kernels. Ken thought the best thing on the platter was the onion slice. I thought the corn bread won out - it was moist and slightly sweet.       As we headed home, the farther away from Big Daddy's we drove, the more dissatisfied with our meal we became. When we reached Scottsdale Rd., before I could ask him to do it, Ken took a right and headed toward Chocolate Star Bakery. We were in desperate need of a happy ending to truly ungratifying experience. The most positive thing I can say is that it's a whole lot better than Dickeys, the nadir of BBQ restaurants.

Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.        I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.       Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.        Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza   Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!

Do you remember Richardson's, probably the best known Southwestern restaurant in Phoenix? It closed a while ago without our ever having been there - the wait was always too long, and I was leery because I had heard that the food, while good, was very, very spicy hot. So I was pleased when Ken informed me that Secreto, a new restaurant in Ahwatukee Foothills, had been opened by Barbara Brown, co-owner of Richardson's.    I'm going to start by telling you how outstanding the food is, because you really should give it a try. Then I'll move on to what I didn't like.   We met foodie friends Leon, Sena and their granddaughter Julie for Sunday lunch. The breakfast menu was also being served. I ordered a stuffed poblano pepper from the appetizer menu (prices ranging from $4-$12). This had been roasted, unlike chile rellenos which are deep fried. It was filled with oozy Mexican cheeses and chorizo, and topped with creme fraiche. The heat level was perfect for me, my lips tingled, but only for a moment. For an appetizer, the serving was good sized. Sena also ordered from the appetizer menu. Her crab cakes,  two atop some salad greens, drizzled with chipotle aioli, were on the hot side for her, but she seemed to enjoy them anyway. When I tasted them, I again felt the seasoning and heat level were perfect, but I thought they had an odd texture. Although they were quite crabby, no pieces of crab were detectable, perhaps they had been too thoroughly mixed with the filler. At any rate, they were delicious.   Ken had intended to order from the breakfast menu because he wanted the carne adovada to come with a fried egg and potatoes, rather than eggless, with rice and beans from the lunch menu. When his food arrived on a dangerously hot metal plate, it was cross-dressed. The egg was there, but served with rice and beans rather than potatoes. We both loved the meat, it had a deep smokey taste with slightly charred edges and was served with just the right amount of red chile sauce. The portion was quite generous - Ken kept passing chunks of meat over to me. There was no liquid on the beans, and they didn't stick together at all. I've never seen them served with rice this way and I didn't care for it, but Ken did. Leon ordered a chicken sandwich. It was huge and looked really good, but was a little hot for him. I really have to remember to stay away from places where the heat level can't be requested for each dish when we're dining together. The mound of curly fries that came with his sandwich were perfectly crispy.   We had flan for dessert. It was delightful in its simplicity, light yet rich and creamy. Thank goodness no one felt compelled to spray phony whipped cream on top or add spices to it. This seemed to be the only dessert offered, but when Julie, Leon and Sena's granddaughter, didn't like it, she was offered Haagen Daaz with chocolate sauce.    Now for the negatives. You can see that a lot of money was spent on the interior, with its attractive copper bar, raised banquettes, and shades made of saguaro spines, but to me it felt dark, heavy and depressing. Because my scooter couldn't be accommodated in the main dining room, we were put in an unpleasant room used for business meetings and large parties. It's a long narrow room and feels like an after thought, only half decorated. Second, there's a charge for chips and salsa. But our real complaint was with the service. It was very slow yet chaotic. Ice teas went unfilled, dishes were given to the wrong people - and this was in an almost empty restaurant. The owner came over a few times, and although she's a lovely lady her presence didn't make the service any more smooth. Since Secreto has been open only since June, perhaps this is a glitch that will disappear over time.   I know we'll go back to try it again. The dinner menu has some interesting items on it that demand our attention.

I've deleted the opening lines of this blog entry at least ten times. I think it's because I don't want to put Renegade Canteen in a niche - doing so might cause some of you not to go, and that would be a shame.       So I'll start by telling you what we had to eat. We shared a wonderful Caesar salad, replete with white anchovies ($7), more than enough for two. I chose to have soup for my entree: Oxtail and Onion Soup with Caramelized Shallots & Sweet Onion topped with Gruyere Cheese ($13). It was delivered to the table in a soup bowl that had a very large, inwardly tilting rim around it on which were sitting three slices of grilled baguette. The bowl itself was covered with a lid. When the server removed it, the toast slid down into the soup, ready to sop up the broth. An oxtail bone was in the middle of the bowl, surrounded by lots of meat (way more than would be on one segment of bone). It struck me as both odd and clever. Presentation is a big part of the experience of eating here, and it's done with flair. The soup was gorgeous, sweet and savory, the meat succulent, and the onions perfectly caramelized. At first I was mildly disappointed that there wasn't a huge amount of cheese, but the oxtail was so rich that more cheese would have been cloying. Ken ordered the special of the day, Roasted Rack of Lamb with Creamed Spinach ($20). The five double chops were lined up on a long narrow plate, the bones of one chop leaning on the meaty portion of the next, all of them balanced in a ribbon of creamed spinach. The meat was cooked perfectly to order, but it was the spinach that blew Ken away. Rather than being pasty, it was lightly sauced and beautifully seasoned. Now, hopefully I've caught your interest, so I can go back to the niche part.       Robert McGrath, formerly of Roaring Fork is the chef here. He's won the James Beard Foundation Award for Best Chef in America-Southwest. But this isn't the hit-you-over-the-head-with-a-chili-pepper Southwest food. The peppers sing quietly in the background, getting along happily with the rest of the well thought out flavors. While many of the dishes have a Southwestern twist, there's lots that are straight American. Chef McGrath has bought along his famous "Big Ass Burger", now called Bob's Big Burger - 12 ounces for $13 - one of the best in town. Steamed Pacific Clams with Copious Amounts of Butter, Garlic, Wine and Bread are $12. A 20 ounce Berkshire Pork Porterhouse weighs in at $22. One of the more entertaining specials is Friday night's "Peter;s Smelly-Old Fish From Last Week".       The only bad thing, and it really was a bummer, was our dessert. Rather than go with  the flourless chocolate cake, i decided to be different and try the Red Beet Root Cake with Carrot-Vanilla Gelato, Candied Pistachios and Carrot & Beet Powder ($7). What was brought to the table was a desiccated scoop of ice cream, too hard to even get the tines of a fork into, and cake which was not much better. Our waiter was appalled by this, saying that the ice cream had been pre-scooped, and he went running back to the kitchen to replace the dessert. Its texture was somewhat better, but for me, the whole concoction was pretty much flavorless. I detected neither beet nor carrot. The candied pistachios were good though. As an apology, our waiter comped Ken's double espresso.       The ambience is upscale but not stuffy. Lot's of dark wood, big upholstered chairs at the dining tables. There's a stunning fireplace on a small patio out back, and a larger patio for diners to one side. Up front there's some leather upholstered couches and arm chairs, which is a good thing, because there were lots of people waiting. The place was shockingly busy for a week night, and I've heard it's a zoo on the week ends. Reservations would seem to be a good idea. I can certainly understand the popularity of Renegade Canteen. It manages to be trendy yet unintimidating for us non-trendy people, has great service and excellent food (I'm willing to overlook the dessert), and very reasonable prices.I think you'll enjoy it, even those of you who are Southwest food averse.

An intriguing concept: Food from areas that the Roman centurions conquered. Places like Achaea (Greece), Hispania (Spain), Gaul (France), Judea (the Middle East), and Britannia (England).       An intriguing menu:  Mushroom, Goat Cheese and Spinach Strudel ($10); Bricked Fired Poached Tilapia with Sage Butter, served with Coconut and Shrimp Risotto ($23); Gnocchi in Shitake Dijon Cream Sauce ($13).       An intriguing venue: A tiny place with old world decor - red walls, chandeliers, lots of empty wine bottles on the ledge behind the banquette, and a cute little patio with an amusing statue of a centurion outside the wrought iron fence.       So what more could you ask? Regrettably, lots...       We were four, for lunch. Ken and I arrived first and ordered an appetizer of Stuffed Mushrooms wrapped in Prosciutto ($8). It did not arrive until well after our friends, Leon and Sena came in. They wanted to try the Strudel, but were told it wasn't available. Our mushrooms were three of the ugliest lumpy things I've seen in a long time. They had been cooked in the pizza oven which pretty much incinerated the ham and dried out the mushrooms However, with enough of the accompanying Aged Cheddar Tarragon Sauce spooned over them, they were fairly tasty. Sena got a panini of eggplant in tomato sauce. The eggplant was almost raw, so it was chewy and bitter. Ken ordered Mussels in a Mustard Sauce ($10) served with Endless Bread. The jar of mustard had never found the sauce. Leon asked for a hamburger with ketchup. He was told that no ketchup was served in the restaurant because it would interfere with the bold flavors of the food. I would applaud this as a policy had there been any bold flavors. Ken quipped that most of the food seemed to have its roots in Britannia. My Espana Pizza ($14) had a nice amount of manchengo and mozzarella cheeses, but was pretty low on the chorizo topping.The crust was something of a disaster - burnt on the edges and flabby in the center.       Service was poor.. With only two other customers in the restaurant, there was no excuse for ice tea glasses that were not refilled until we pointed it out, dishes that were not cleared from the table to make way for new ones, a long wait for Ken's entree to be served after the other three had arrived, and the lack of a bowl to put his mussel shells in. The restaurant also had a general air of sloppiness about it. I don't believe that chef/owner Eric Osburn was in the house while we were there, at least I hope he wasn't. But he needs to be more aware of what's going on when he isn't present.       Hopefully Centurion will make the effort to live up to its concept, menu and venue. I'd like to be intrigued.

Shortly after posting my entry about Centurion (see below) I received an email from chef/owner Eric Osburn stating that the had, indeed, not been in the restaurant during our lunch because someone had set fire to their fence, and he was taking care of that. We had noticed the damage on our way in. He asked that we give Centurion another try. Since, as I said in my review, there were many intriguing things about the place, we decided to do that.       The patio had been repaired, and even improved on, with the addition of canvas "sails" overhead to block the sun. It was 2PM, there were few customers, and we were able to have a good conversation with Eric. He's a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park and is passionate about food. With Centurion, he wants to overturn many of the problems he's noticed in other restaurants. He aims to be high-end, but with reasonable prices and no pretension. His kitchen is right in back of the windows looking out on Roosevelt, so the cooks don't feel shut in. And like many chefs now, he tries to use local and sustainable products, making for a seasonal menu. He even told me a great way to cook butternut squash - using a cider reduction and vanilla.       The truly notable changes in our meal were with the stuffed mushrooms and the sauce that came with the mussels. Instead of being ugly lumps, the mushrooms were a work of art. They had been split, stuffed with rice, and wrapped in proscuitto. Looking like exotic oysters, they were so pretty I hated to cut into them. But I was glad I did, because this time they were perfectly cooked and delicious. The mustard sauce on the mussels was well balanced, with the flavors of mustard and white wine playing off each other. We kept soaking it up with the accompanying tasty house-made bread. I have to say I still wasn't crazy about the eggplant panini, but it was more thoroughly cooked than the last time. I guess it's just a matter of taste.       Because it was Eric who served us, things went well. I'm willing to accept the fact that the staff had been upset about the fire and not functioning as well as they ordinarily would. We'll be going back to try the dinner entrees, so I guess we'll find out.

Forgive me for being gross, but I have to tell you my favorite way to judge a Jewish-style deli. It's by how much you enjoy the post-meal burps. And the new JJ's Delicatessen at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road rates high on the burp-o-meter!! It's been open since July in the spot once occupied by Kashman's. In my opinion, JJ's is much better. The service is lovely (a big change), the menu extensive, and the food delicious.       I ordered the signature sandwich, a "Pnish" ($8.95). It's a "square potato knish sliced in half and filled with your favorite meat, cheese and dressing, then grilled panini style". I chose corned beef, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. For my included-in-the-price side, I got cole slaw. In general I'm not a great fan of knishes, but this one did make a great (and unusual) sandwich. The corned beef was a tad dry, but with Russian dressing and cole slaw, who'd notice? The cole slaw was fabulous; I appreciated its sweetness, and Ken its sourness. We both loved the freshness. All the salads are made daily. As are the breads and bagels. Ken had a cinnamon raisin bagel, which I, of course, tried. It was more dense than most Arizona bagels, and chewy, so it reminded me somewhat of New York bagels. Ken's fruit platter was quite large, and the fruit was ripe and tasty.       All the pastry looked delicious. We took home a chocolate horn and an apricot hamantaschan. Both were shockingly good. The hamantaschan dough was melt-in-your-mouth rich, and the tart filling was a pleasant contrast. The texture of the chocolate horn was perfect, it shattered when I bit into it, yet it wasn't dry. The chocolate had a good flavor. By the way, iced coffee goes perfectly with chocolate horns, and JJ's makes theirs using a cold drip method. I had ice tea with my sandwich, and it was excellent.       We're planning to try breakfast at JJ's. There's a huge variety of options including a L.E.O.($9.95), matzo brie ($8.95), and a whitefish salad platter ($10.95). Latkes and blintzes are both available at $10.95. Not cheap, but I bet there'd be enough to share. Coffee comes in many forms: cappucino, latte, macchiato, etc. And more pastry.       As we were getting ready to leave I experienced my first JJ's burp. I got into the car with a big smile on my face.

About three weeks ago the Greek gods decided to take a break from their endless squabbling, descend from Mt. Olympus, and pay a visit to us mortals. Fortunately they landed in Phoenix, and they came bearing gifts. These can be sampled at Athena Greek Cuisine, a new restaurant in the shopping center at Mayo and Scottsdale Rd.       If the Scordalia ($6) isn't heaven sent, I don't know what is. This spread, made from bread, almonds, potato, olive oil, white wine vinegar and GARLIC is jaw-droppingly good. It has a mellow, almost sweet taste and is good smeared on anything, but especially on the Greek Sausage appetizer ($7), another gift. In fact, all the appetizers we had were delicious. Ken chose Grilled Octopus ($12); Pat had Greek Style Wings ($9), which had been marinated in olive oil, parsley, oregano and lemon (these were even better cold the next day). Marinated Beets ($7) were refreshing. Meg, to whom we owe a debt of gratitude for introducing us to Athena, says the Fried Smelts ($7) are tasty too. It's so nice to have out-of-the-ordinary menu selections available. And the servings are surprisingly large, great for sharing.       The entrees don't reach the sublime level of the appetizers, but for the most part they were good and reasonably priced. Meg and I split Moussaka ($13). It was as good as any I've had in Phoenix, but there was nothing to lift it out of the ordinary. Stewed green beans were served with all the entrees, and these were a nice foil for the richness of the moussaka. Ken had the Combination Plate ($15) which had Pastitsio, Moussaka, Dolmades with Avgolemono Sauce, and Roasted Leg of Lamb. I thought the lamb was  overcooked (but that seems to be the norm for Greek restaurants) and tasted curiously liver-y. Pat was disappointed with her Greek Spaghetti ($12) which was way too salty.       We were quite full, but Pat, being half Greek, felt we had to sample the Galaktoboureko, a filo and custard concoction. The custard was pasty, rather than silky, and the lemon sauce needed some zest to wake it up. But it was nice to see something besides Baklava on the menu (in fact there were a number of Greek desserts).        I loved Athena's decor. It's happily over the top. There's a statue of Athena centered in the doorway, an aqua back-lit frieze on one wall, a white bar framed with Greek columns. The white painted wooden chairs (which Ken said were not very comfortable) look great against the dark floor. The only jarring note is the two TV screens flanking the bar. If you go on Athena's website you can get a virtual tour of the restaurant, and also check out the menu.        Our waiter Chris and his "shadow" were both very pleasant and seemed familiar with the menu. There was a huge amount of staff for the number of patrons, but better too many than too few. Given that Athena has been open only for a short time, I find it easy to overlook the shortcomings - in fact we're planning to return this weekend. We'll probably stick to the appetizers, but believe me, that's no sacrifice!

Back in the gold rush days before the real-estate bubble burst, we went to Fiamma Restaurant in the Mondrian Hotel (or was it called the James Hotel?) for a post theater dinner. The driveway was lined with hummers, manned by twenty-somethings in their $200 jeans, all screaming for attention. It was no better inside: the noise was deafening, the service poor, the food downright bad and the prices outrageous.       How things have changed! The hotel is now The Theodore, and the parking lot, when we arrived at 6 PM on a Saturday, was deserted, as was the lobby. As, indeed was the restaurant, although by 7:30 (the hour when people more civilized than we go out to eat) several more tables were occupied.  Service was outstanding, the food excellent and reasonably priced. Under Chef Comer Smith the seasonal menu is Italian, with the emphasis on local and sustainable ingredients. The pasta is made from scratch daily, and it tastes like it - toothsome and fresh. Gelato is also house-made.        The menu changes frequently and I forgot to write down the descriptions and cost of our entrees, so please forgive any errors. Ken had the special of tuna and olives in a tomato sauce with big fat spaghetti (I don't know it's technical name). From his first bite he raved about the quality of the pasta. The serving size was generous. I ordered braised pork shoulder with brussels sprouts served over polenta with gorgonzola ($20). The combination was divine as was the rich sauce served on it. I had read that the truffled mac & cheese ($6) was good, so I had to give it a try. At first I thought it was bland and under truffle-oiled, but after a few forkfuls I could appreciate the subtlety. I forced myself to leave a bite or two so I'd have room for dessert. Panacotta ($8) was one of the choices, and something Ken loves. It was a peach version, served atop a disc of white chocolate and accompanied by a limoncello granita. I had the intriguing sensation of being able to taste the colors. This truly is food made by a thoughtful chef.       I looked on line at some of the past menus so I could give you a few more examples of the cuisine and the prices. One of the appetizers was Polpettine Siciliano ($10): little meatballs with raisins, pinenuts, tomato sauce and baked ricotta salata. Braised Oxtail Tortellini ($17) served with tomato sugo and parmesan crema was something I have to go back and try (I think it was on our menu). Jumbo Sea Scallops ($26) with blood orange and fennel caponata didn't sound bad either. Pizzas ($14) are made in a wood burning oven.And, of course, here's the best part - you guessed it! - Ciello (pronounced chee-EL-oh) is on Restaurant.com.       I have to comment here about the decor of both the hotel lobby and the restaurant. If I thought Athena (see below) was over-the-top, Ciello takes the cake. Actually you feel like you're inside a wedding cake, all white and rococo, although there is some odd rooster art left over from a previous incarnation. The mishmash of styles - huge steer heads and abstract sculptures - was a great conversation maker.

There's an odd disconnect between the name, the menu, and the ambience of Amaro Pizzeria & Vino Lounge. I've never seen a pizzeria that looked like this: dark wood paneling, carpeting, a huge chandelier, cloth napkins. It's a very traditional, upscale Italian look which I think would appeal more to the 40-and-up crowd than the 20 somethings. The menu has way more than pizza on it, and some of the dishes are even a little adventurous. Prices fall in between the two concepts.       The team behind Amaro has had lots of restaurant experience, including stints at Kazimierz Wine Bar and The Estate House. Chef Bernie Kantak of Cowboy Ciao played a part in developing the menu. In fact he loaned his name to the signature salad, The Kantak Chop ($12). This salad alone makes the trek to Cave Creek worthwhile. It comes to the table with bands of finely chopped smoked salmon, asiago cheese, dried corn, pepitas, currents, couscous, arugula, and tomatoes. Our waiter dressed it lightly with pesto/buttermilk dressing, and tossed it for us. The melding of tastes and textures was perfect. I've never had dried corn before; its sweet crunch is a revelation.        We decided to try the Dolce Arrabiatta pizza ($15). Our server asked if we liked spicy food. When I asked how spicy, and he said "VERY", we opted to have the Calabrian chili peppers on the side. A good decision. We carefully picked all the seeds off the tiny pieces of pepper before gingerly putting them (sparingly) on our slices. Even so, it was a sinus-clearing experience, but truly delicious. The pizza here reminds me of an Americanized version of the outstanding pizza served at Pomo (where you should go if you haven't yet). The crust is a little firmer than Pomo's and the topping choices more familiar. In addition to the chiles our pizza had lots of Taleggio cheese, both sweet and spicy sausage, and caramelized onions. We added some sliced garlic. We used perhaps one tenth of the peppers that were brought to us in a little ramekin - the full amount (including seeds, the hottest part of the pepper) is what is usually put on the pizza. Beware.       There was a very unusual dessert on the menu, Baba Au Rhum, with a twist. The large brioche was soaked in rum, split, and filled with marscapone mousse and fresh raspberries, drizzled with hazelnut/milk chocolate sauce, sprinkled with chopped hazelnuts, and served warm. It was soothing, and put out the fire raging in our mouths. For $7, this dessert was big enough to serve 4.        As I said, this isn't your mama's pizzeria. There's a choice of 9 antipasti including shrimp scampi and meatballs (both $9); 5 pasta dishes, and 4 entrees, ranging in price from ($17 - $23). The Filet Marinato, a house specialty, sounded good - an 8 ounce piece of beef tenderloin in a black peppercorn demi glace served with an asiago baked potato and pancetta sauteed spinach. Eight pizzas, plus a design-your-own range in price from $10 -$15 and can feed two or three people.       The wine bar, separated from the restaurant by a clear plastic partition is large and attractive. I understand its jumping on weekends. Happy Hour is from 4 - 6 daily, and Reverse Happy Hour from 9 - 10 daily.      All in all, Amaro's is a very nice place to come if you want something more upscale than the usual formica tabled neighborhood place. More interesting food for not much more money. A good deal.

Not even as good as its predecessor Silver Spur which paled in comparison to the original Satisfied Frog.      The oil used to fry the food needed changing desperately, so it ruined our broasted chicken, fries, and onion rings.  In a restaurant where probably a third of the dishes go into the fryer, why would you do this?       No complaints about the service, and the veggies in the limited salad bar were fresh enough.       Over all, this rated a big blah.

It's a brilliant concept, really, non-threatening food (brussels sprouts are probably the scariest thing on the menu) given an interesting tweak here and there to make it worthy of a night out. And judging from the crowd that showed up on a rainy Sunday evening, it's working. The diners were a mixed bunch: lots of families with their kids, lots of singles at the community table.        Chef Justin Beckett, formerly of Canal, his wife and some friends took over the space previously occupied by That's Italiano, a restaurant that deserved to close. They did a lovely renovation, with exposed wood beams, an open kitchen, lots of windows, and the above mentioned community table, made from a fallen black walnut tree. To put you in a good mood there's a number of specialty cocktails, a nice wine list, and 4 draught beers, plus others by the bottle. Our server, Allison, was delightful - very funny, but also very professional.        The menu isn't large, but it was hard to make a selection since everything sounds good. An interesting appetizer entry is Beckett's Original Grilled Cheese served with  roasted red pepper tomato soup ($9). Creamy Grits & Spicy Andouille Sausage ($8) was tempting. Ken opted to get two appetizers for his meal, the Chef's Country Pate ($8) and those scary Roasted Brussels Sprouts with pancetta, shaved manchego cheese and lemon thyme vinaigrette ($6). I thought it strange that this was considered an appetizer. For me, the Crisp Butter Lettuce Salad, green grapes, toasted pecans, candied lemon vinaigrette ($6) and a side of Mac and Cheese ($5, as are all the side dishes including the bacon cheddar biscuits which we ordered while trying to decide on the rest of our meal). Our friend Sena decided, after much pondering, on the pork osso bucco ($17). And Leon ordered his usual hamburger - in this case the "B"  Burger with Buttered Brioche, Boursin, Bib lettuce, Beefsteak tomato ($13).       So how was it? The biscuits, which arrived first were a good omen. They were more scone-like than biscuity, but they were delicious, especially with the accompanying apple honey butter. Ken enjoyed his pate, which came with lots of things to eat with it, including peanut brittle. Sena's osso bucco was delicious, tender and rich. The only problem was that the carrots served in the roasted vegetable medley were terribly undercooked. The same was true, to a lesser extent, of the brussels sprouts plus they were pretty much tasteless. The vinaigrette on my salad was outstanding, but the grapes and pecans were in short supply. Leon said his burger was just okay, but he seems to feel that way about most of the burgers he orders. One day we'll find him one that will knock his socks off! If anybody has any suggestions, please let me know.       The entrees didn't live up to the biscuits, but I had high hopes for dessert ($5 each). There's a strange one - Chocolate Dipped Bacon S'Mores with caramel, housemade marshmallow, whipped peanut butter, and graham crackers. But I had to go with the Fig & Pecan Pie which came with cream cheese and citrus zest ice cream. This was delectable, rich but not too sweet. I usually don't like cream cheese ice cream, but this was a perfect match for the pie and the citrus zest just sung out. Loved it. Ken grumbled a little about the poor selection of tea, and the fact that there was no espresso.       All things considered, despite the negatives, I'd go back. I have the feeling that things will get better and better.   Beckett's Table 3717 E. Indian School      Phoenix     602-954-1700 (reservations are a good idea) 5 - 10PM  Tuesday through Sunday beckettstable.com

More than a top notch chocolatier/bakery, this is a great place for a sit-down dessert and coffee. Everyone is super friendly,knowledgeable and truly cares about their product. Christene (the baker's daughter) not only was schooled in Europe, but she imports her chocolate from there too. If you like your desserts and candy with layers of flavor and texture, this is the place for you!!!

We've been to a few new places lately, some were even pretty good, but none inspired me to write. Until today. We had lunch at a brand new place in Old Town Scottsdale called Big Earl's. It's a BBQ joint run by the people responsible for La Petite Maison.  Nice to be so multi-faceted!   While you can get the usual BBQ suspects (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, etc.) the big treat for us was "Tasty Parts". This section of the menu included fried sweetbreads ($8.99), oven roasted beef bone marrow with pickled okra ($7.99), and pickled pig's feet  ($5.99). I know a lot of you are cringing at the thought, but believe me, this is great stuff. We had crispy pig tails with ranch dressing ($5.99) - two big deep fried items that were the shape of hot dog buns. I was thankful that they weren't curled. The meat, which you strip from the bone was succulent, especially when eaten with the fried batter, dressing, and a little BBQ sauce. I'll admit the remains did look kind of gross. Roasted pork belly with caramelized onions ($6.99) was our second dish. It wasn't quite as good as the tails since it didn't crunch, but I was licking my fingers anyway.   We had started with an appetizer of  Barbacoa nachos of Texas beef brisket, Memphis Pork Butt and Velveeta Love ($8.99). The chips had been more than generously layered with the tender, smokey meats - so much in fact that I ended up taking home a large cupful of meat, which will make a great sandwich tomorrow. We also shared a blue cheese wedge ($3.99). The lettuce was nice and fresh and the dressing actually tasted like blue cheese. The bacon bits raised the salad to a higher level, so tasty and crunchy.    Both of us were stuffed, but there was one dessert that we had to try - Pecan and  Date pie ($3.99).  OMG, this was to die for. Somehow the chef managed to control the sweetness, and the creamy, tangy topping was a brilliant touch.    The restaurant is cute, not overly kitchy. There's a great soundtrack of old fashioned cowboy songs playing quietly in the background. The servers are very attentive but unobtrusive.I LOVE THIS PLACE. There's a lot more on the menu we want to sample. I think Big Earl's will become one of our go-to restaurants.

At last, a restaurant worth blogging about!! It's been a long dry spell filled with mediocre meals, and a few real losers. In fact, my despair was so great it drove me to diet. We'd go out occasionally, but it was always easy to order a salad (my fat free dressing traveled with me) and not feel deprived. So it was with low expectations that we went to Bonfire Grill and Bar.  This five month old newbie is in Old Town Scottsdale, occupying the building that had housed Furio. That it is close to The Mission (see my 7/1/10 blog "Kiss My Grits) is no coincidence. Matt Carter, executive chef and proprietor of both The Mission and Zinc Bistro created the menu, and his former sous chef Eric Guerin is now Bonfire's executive chef. Carter mentored the manager of Bonfire, Jimmy Swann, a firefighter and newcomer to the restaurant business. It's rare to find a team so eager to please their customers.  Bonfire serves elevated American comfort food. Many of the selections are cooked over a pecan wood fire, and this divine smell greets you in the parking lot. There were so many temptations on the menu, I knew my diet dressing would remain hidden in my pocketbook. We started by sharing a grilled artichoke ($8) filled with sun dried tomatoes, and served with a delicious garlic aioli. It was quite large, perfectly tender, and fed three of us.   It wasn't easy to select our entrees. One of everything would have been nice. But eventually I ordered the BBQ Short Rib Skewer sandwich ($9) served on MJ bread with beer braised onions, Tillamook cheese and a chipotle BBQ sauce. It came with fries, lightly dusted with onion powder and a homemade chipotle ketchup. The chipotle taste was evident, but the heat level was happily low. The chunks of short rib were tender and moist even though all the fat had miraculously disappeared. Ken had short ribs too, but his entree came from the brunch menu - Short Rib Hash With Buttermilk Biscuits ($10). The chef obligingly put the potatoes on the side in a cute little iron pot. The biscuits were both chewy and fluffy. Ernest decided on the Skewered Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($7) With Roasted Tomato, Bacon and Arugula. He seemed very pleased. Anna's Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger ($9) looked good, but her Honey Mustard Coleslaw was the real hit. It was lightly dressed, yet full of flavor. Given the size and quality of these dishes, the price was truly a bargain. The only nit I might pick here (I had to find one so you wouldn't think I'd lost my edge) is the over-use of the skewer concept.  Since I'd already blown my diet, why pass up desert? A Cast Iron Toasted Marshmallow Smores dish with Shaved Chocolate, Graham Cracker Cookies (homemade, not the flat board-like kind), and Malted Vanilla Ice Cream ($6) went with the Bonfire concept, but Jimmy urged us to try the Chocolate Bread Pudding with Banana Ice Cream ($6). Good choice! A huge portion of warm, gooey chocolate with hints of banana and caramel paired perfectly with the ice cream. Eventually I gave my spoon to Ken and told him not to give it back no matter how much I begged.  The ambiance is pleasant. Lots of dark wood, with an impressive wooden collage on the wall behind the bar, commissioned from a local artist. I think it would be nice if more art work took the place of some of the innumerable TV sets lining the walls. But at least their sound was muted, and enjoyable music was being played at a reasonable noise level (live music Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights). There's a communal table, booths, high and low top tables, and very comfortable upholstered chairs. A good thing if you can't bring yourself to leave between lunch and dinner service.

What a DISAPPOINTMENT !!  About a month ago we had a stellar lunch here. Great food, even better service. Decided to bring friends back with us to give them a treat. My bad.  Our server was perfunctory at best, with an attitude. Dishes came out of the kitchen with no thought - starters were served with mains, items were missing from several plates. Some were inedible (meatballs and lava chicken). It took ages for the food to come out of the kitchen (at a not very busy lunch hour). This happened on our first visit too, but since everything was tasty, and our waiter entertaining we didn't mind. But who wants to wait for bad food and unpleasant service?

Outstanding cookies and biscotti, to eat on the run or send to a lucky friend. We sampled a few. The oatmeal raisin is one of the best I've had - nice and moist, not the typical dry, overly chewy kind, with lots of nice spices. The ginger biscotti, dipped in good quality chocolate, was more moist than usual, good for eating with or without dipping. These are the kinds of cookies that will hold up well during shipping.      While we were sad to see Chocolate Star Bakery (at this location) had gone out of business, we were quickly comforted.
