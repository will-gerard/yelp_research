Been a resident here for 14 months. New ownership right after I signed 2nd year lease in July. First I should point out at renewal the agent in the office quoted us a rate. When we came to sign the paperwork the next day, price was $70 a month higher. The woman working said he must have misquoted us. I fought with corporate office for 3 days to get then to honor the quote he gave. Since that time service has dropped to horrible levels. Shower head broke off - 3 days to replace. Sink faucet knob broke in half. Guy looked at it & told me he had a knob for it but needed to go to storage room to get it. Said he'd be back in 10 minutes. Never returned. 3 days later it was replaced after I had to contact the office about it again twice. The excuse? Only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Now, our washing machine is broken. It overflowed a week ago & flooded our hall. Went to office to let them know & she said she would send maintenance right over. Never came. Contacted them again next day & excuse was, again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. Guy came and shop vacuumed water but was still another day to look at washer. Got a call from manager that it's fixed. Yay right? Wrong! So it isn't overflowing now. It just doesn't spin out or refill for rinse cycle. Doh! Went to office again. Will have someone look at it "tomorrow". Tomorrow came & no one came so I called office an hour before closing (it was Friday). Excuse? Again, only 1 maintenance guy on staff. And no one will be here over the weekend so she'll have him come Monday. Not to be a dick, but them having only 1 maintenance guy is their problem, not mine. a week and still no washer? how about pulling a working one from an empty apartment for a quick fix? Or at least a credit to my rent for having to go to a laundromat 2 weeks in a row? Creative solutions & customer service people! But there is neither, just excuses. Hence this review recommending you STAY AWAY from this property.

Awesome prices, decent stuff. But if you need to get in and out quick DO NOT go on the weekend! It's like Black Friday every Saturday & Sunday.

I like this theater, 25 screens so good variety. Good matinee prices ($7). Buy the reusable drink cup for $4.75. Bring it back each time for $1 refills.

Took my parents who are in from Ohio. CR back there is good food & a good time. However CR Tempe isn't. It was Friday night but very slow, so that should have been a red flag. Five of us went for dinner. Only one meal was rated OK, the rest were horrible. Burgers were dry & tasteless. Chicken wings undercooked and virtually sauceless. Waitress was slow & wasn't knowledgeable about menu questions. The pretzel with dipping cheese appetizers were great but that wasn't enough to up the stars. The manager did come to the table about undercooked wings, but he had an arrogant attitude, leaning into my moms face & saying "so what's your problem with the wings." While at the table he was also hugging the waitress while she was hanging on him. Not at all professional. Choose another place if you want good food & good service.

This place ALWAYS sucks. Waited 10 min in the only line to order a scone. Once I got to th head of the line, the guy behind the counter told me he couldn't get it for me but he'd get someone who could. Really, you can't put a scone that's 10 feet away in a bag? But you can walk about 40 feet and go through a door for 2-3 minutes to get someone else to do it while we all continue to wait? So anyway, he comes back out and takes next person in line while I wait 10 more min for someone to finally come out from the back (seriously I timed it). Then that person told me she had to make sandwiches first. Seriously? Put a scone in a dang bag. So at this point I left irritated because of 20 min wait & still didn't get the scone I came in for. Instead I drove up the street to Wildflower where I was in & out with a scone in 4 minutes...with a line. Take note Paradise, this is one reason why Wildflower is so much better than you (aka you suck). Paradise is more like Paradise Lost...I won't be back.

Unbelievably slow! There were 2 people waiting outside & 4 inside all waiting on food. After waiting 5 minutes @ counter I finally got someone to come take my order, 2 slices & a drink, "grab & go special". No truth to the name. Waited 15 more minutes for slices. When I left, guy outside was coming in to cancel his order. Lady he was with already had eaten & he still didn't have his sub. Also I ordered to go but they gave it to me on a plate not in a box. Definitely wouldn't go back.

Good burger (BBQ). Bun was toasted and seemed to have a garlic toast flavor on the grilled area (garlic butter used to toast bun?). Burger itself was large and well cooked to order. Excellently flavored Gouda cheese used for this burger, along with some onion straws (nice thick ones like onion rings, not those dry wimpy ones). Great sandwich!  I chose a side salad with honey mustard which was excellent too! Fresh mixed greens with carrots, tomato, red onion. Other side options were fries or Asian slaw. Even better reason it was extra tasty? My friend Mark bought...THANKS MARK!  :)

Wash isn't very good. Had some dried bugs on front of the car & passenger side window. $12 super wash removed NONE of them. After reading reviews how awesome this place is I was VERY disappointed. Free vacuums are nice, but who cares if the outside is still dirty?  I've been to WAY better.  :(

My old girlfriend was a too hippy b**ch so the mere name of this establishment, Two Hippy Beach House, gave me the chills. But word on the street (and Yelp!) was this place is awesome, so I mustered up my courage & headed over.  This place is incredible! Basically they do tacos, burgers & hot dogs, but with creative quality toppings that make them exceptional. I had a red shredded beef taco & two green shredded beef tacos. Best taco I've eaten in quite awhile! They also do pork, cactus & chicken tacos. Also chips & guacamole. Yum!  They also do flavored lemonade. But unusual flavors like blood orange (what I had). Very tasty! Not bitter like my mom's personality.  They also do breakfast, so I'll be trekking over to check that out another day.  So, in conclusion, are you hungry? The mellow out man...and get yourself over to the Two Hippie Beach House.

Pretty new location. This one is drive thru or walk up only. They have no inside seating but there are some shaded outdoor tables. Bathrooms are outside as well. Staff is super friendly and drive thru is very quick.
