Flamingo Palace has a great online menu and ordering was very easy. Took my credit card over the phone and even though they said 30 minutes it took 45 minutes, but hey for great Chinese food I can wait an extra 15 minutes. The delivery driver was very nice and the food was still hot!  We ordered: Vegetable Fried Rice- Excellent Sweet and Sour chicken- Very good Broccoli Chicken- Very good Egg rolls- Good Egg Flower Soup (egg drop)- Good (but needed pepper)  We will order from here again (and again, and again) in the future!

I typically really enjoy Chili's and think the food and service is great. This is the first time at this location and will be the last. We went there for lunch last week and had horrible service and we were not even there during "lunch rush". The waitress was not busy had maybe two other tables the entire time we were there. Yet, two tables that were sat after us in a different section received their food before us, even though we had ordered first.   Chips were greasy, food was cold and was impossible to get a refill on drinks. Next time we are craving Chili's we will drive a few extra miles and go to the Chili's at PV Mall.

The potatoes are AMAZING...   Everything else (omelets, pancake and chicken fried steak) was really good too...  But the potatoes! Best.Thing.Ever.

We walk in to this restaurant and while from the outside it looks a tad "run down" but the inside is very warm and cozy and sets the stage for a great seafood meal. When you walk in they have a cute table made out of an old lobster crate and the walls have photos that have a New England feel to them.   The worst part of the meal was being seated.  About half the restaurant had empty seats and a sign that said please wait to be seated and wait we did... in fact three employees walked by us without so much as a hello or we will be right with you. We waited over 5 minutes before we were greeted and seated (yes I am a poet and didn't know it). When we were seated the "hostess" had the personality of a rock, she must really not like her job, not a smile or greeting out of her.   I would say they are "child" friendly but bring your own entertainment. We had our 3 year old son with us and while they did have a kids menu (with a pretty painted fish on the back) that was laminated, there were no crayons (the typical kid package) to color with. Luckily I had a couple of crayons in the car which my husband went out to get and we had enough to keep him occupied until the food came.  Here is what we ordered: Crab stuffed shrimp- which was out of this world, I loved them and might be the best I have had. Clam Chowder-My husband is kind of a clam chowder snob and he thought this was pretty good. Not the best he has ever had but he said it was good. I am not a fan of clam chowder but I thought it was good and I liked the big chucks of clam in it. Steamed Clams- My husband and son "shared" these. My husband said they were good, again not the "best" he has had but still good. Shrimp and Chips -This was what my son ordered but ended up eating more of my husband's clam chowder and steamed clams. So, my husband had one, I had one and our son had the third. The "chips" were waffle fries which was pretty cool and the coleslaw it came with my husband really liked.  We would go back to this restaurant again, and if you are in the mood for some good seafood in the area, this is the place to go!

Super disappointed in the service today. They had a sale buy 3 get 3 free. I had six items and I asked a sales gal if the items I had qualified for the 3 for 3. She said yes- it was basically everything except these two men's sections (which she pointed out to me). I get to the register and the gal at the register says that my items don't qualify. So the girl that had told me that came over and says to me "oh, you must have misunderstood me, these don't qualify" Um no... I didn't misunderstand anything, which is why I asked you specifically if they qualified before I got in the long line at the register. What a waste of time and energy.

We had a business lunch there yesterday and it was packed with the Arts festival going on. The City of Scottsdale is having an arts festival this weekend and it is very cool! We went after and there were two stages, lots of booths and even a kids area!  Back to AZ88, I guess the reason you are reading this!  There was a line to get in (although we took patio seating outside and got to sit right away). The couple in front of us had a little marital "tiff" as the wife didn't want to sit outside. The temps were in the 70's and this couple was from Wisconsin, but hey their loss was our gain!   As usual the food was excellent! I had the club sandwich with bacon and chicken.  The waffle fries (my favorite by the way) were a little skimpy but I made it work, with the huge sandwich that was served!  However on this visit, the service was not that great. One person in my party (there were three of us) asked for extra dressing with her salad, when she needed it (about 15 minutes into the meal) she finally just got up and went to ask for it. Same when we wanted the check, our waitress was nowhere to be found. Took forever to get our check and then when she never came to get our payment we just went inside.  That being said, when there is not an event happening, this place has good service, funky bathrooms (and I mean FUNKY) and free wireless! When I want a quiet "working" lunch this is the place I like to go.

Stayed at NY NY and thought the Family Meal provided here would be a good option for us (2 adults and 2 kids). Boy, was I wrong! We ate around 6 pm.   First, I was told they were out of hush puppies as part of the family meal, but they would add a piece of chicken instead. Then, we were told they were ALSO out of the shrimp (as part of the family meal), so I asked if they could sub fried clams instead of fried shrimp and was immediately told "no, but we can give you another piece of chicken". I immediately questioned this since a piece of chicken is not comparable to fried shrimp and they asked if I wanted to talk to the manager. I replied "yes", not realizing this meant I would need to call the manager on the phone.   **Side Rant: if you are going to be out of two items included in a Family Meal deal, either make a decision beforehand, or empower your employees to make a decision on substitutions that make sense. Rant over.   The manager ended up substituting the clam strips for the shrimp.   My son ordered the clam chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl and they served it in a plastic bowl with a slice of bread in a plastic container for him. What a joke!  Overall, the food was okay. The clam strips and the fish were good. Nobody wanted to eat the chicken and the waffle fries were way overcooked.   Would not recommend.

After reading reviews on Yelp my husband and I decided to try this place. We took our son and a guest who was visiting from Columbia.   Let me just get down to it- The good, the bad and the ugly....  The good- Very large portions- if we had liked the food we would have had leftovers for days The Bakery- That was attached to the restaurant was very (VERY) good- keep in mind the prices are a tad on the expensive side. So, expect excellent baked goods for a high price.  The Bad There was only one word for the service and it wasn't good.... Altogether there were two waitresses serving both the bakery and the restaurant. They had two other tables when we arrived and a total of six when we left. Numerous times I had to ask for a refill on my drink, for some dressing, etc. It took a while to get our check even after asking for it.   And... The Ugly They didn't have any type of "kids" menu... nor did they have Mac and Cheese! No Mac and Cheese? Throw some pasta on and put some cheese on it! If this is a from scratch type of restaurant make some Mac and Cheese from scratch! The restaurant itself was a hole-in-the-wall type place and looked it. I could have overlooked this had the food been good.  The food My husband was shocked they had clam chowder on the menu- if you have seen my earlier reviews you know he is a sucker for good chowder. So he asked the waitress if it was homemade. She said yes- After one bite- my husband says "no way"- It was Campbell's Soup all the way! We had Chicken Parmigiana, Lasagna and Spaghetti.  All were just fair. Nothing to write home about! Again large portions, but not anything I wanted to reheat and eat!

Let me start off by saying that I like Quizno's- I like their how their sandwiches are warm and the soup is always good. The chip selection could be better, but that is something that I could work around. I love how they have a pickle "bar" that you can snack on pickles with your meal! I happen to really like pickles so this concept is great to me. I went to this Quizno's today and for the second time in a row (I went there a couple of weeks ago) the service was just bad. I specifically ask for no tomatoes when I order my sandwich. . I don't know if the "front" people are not talking to the "back" people but come on they are 5 feet away from one another.  I don't like tomatoes on a sandwich! The girl really started picking the tomatoes off my sandwich like she was irritated that I didn't want tomatoes. Then put my sandwich in the bag. Not only did this happen on this visit it happened last time as well. Is this Quizno's really in that bad of shape that they cannot make me a new sandwich?  The service at this Quizno's will prevent me from going back I will either go someplace else to eat or I will drive the extra five miles to a different Quizno's that will value me as a customer. So today  before I can eat my sandwich I have to pick the remaining tomatoes out as there is still "slime" and "seeds" that cannot be removed... Good thing I am not allergic to tomatoes... that would not be good!

I would recommend having lunch here!!  The margarita pizza (with house-made mozzarella) was really good! The red sauce was great and it had just enough cheese!   The soda comes in cans/bottles which is interesting...
