Stopped in for dinner around five (dinner time).  We were greeted and seated right away.  Our drink order was taken by an employee who appeared to be the manager.  After that it appeared some type of a shift change was going on.  After our order was taken it was a very long time for our food to arrive.  Our drink glasses went empty.  When the food did arrive it was good.  We were given pieces of pie on the way out due to our wait.    Had the food arrived and drinks refilled this would have been a 4 star review.  With the very long wait I feel I am being generous with a 2.

The Creative Cafe is a good place for a great meal.  Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted promptly and seated.  I was a little worried as only a few tables were occupied.  It was slightly before the normal dinner time.  In a little time a few other people came in and then more and more.  Almost everyone entering was known to the staff and it appeared to be a popular local dinner destination in Casa Grande.  In just a short amount of time the place was buzzing.  It was just a matter of time and I could clearly see why.  I ordered the fish and chips and my wife went with a salad.  Looking at the prior reviews we also went with the sweet potato wedges.  From where I was seated I could see inside of the kitchen and three cooks were busy preparing the food.  When the food arrived the presentation was remarkable, especially the salad.    My wife went with the jalapeno ranch dressing and was very pleased and asked for a little more.  My fish was battered just right and was crunching and flavorful.  The fries had just the right amount of crunch and the slaw appeared to be fresh.  The sweet potato wedges were no disappointment either!    Casa Grande is located between Phoenix and Tucson with interstate 10 running through it.  Several people stop here for food and gas.  If you are traveling through the area and want a great meal take the extra 5 minutes it takes to drive here.  It is well worth it!  Great food and service.

This Apple store can get very busy.  When we went to buy our current imac we got what we needed.  The employees are great with the common stuff but anything technical I found them struggling a little and having to ask different employees in order to come up with the answers.    A big plus here is they did not try to over sell us anything.  As a matter of fact I was talked out of the computer configuration I was looking at and into a little lower model for what our needs were.  Pretty honest people here.    I will return to this location when I am in the area.  It is great place for any of my Apple needs however I will plan enough time for a wait

This was our first time trying Filly's Roadhouse and hopefully will not be our last.  Our evening here provided us with a great meal, cold drinks, live band, and a perfect place to watch the sun go down.    The place was packed when we arrived and the majority of the seating is outside in the rear of the location.  The seating is a bunch of picnic tables with vinyl tablecloths.  The band was just starting to warm up.  We felt our drink order was taken fairly quickly with the amount of people they were serving.    When the food arrived the bar-b-q was great.  The sides and meats were perfect tasting.  The band was in full swing and everyone was having a great time.  We watched the sun set on the Superstition Mountains while enjoying our meal and listening to the music.  It wasn't too long and my wife found herself line dancing.    Our stop here provided one of the best total entertaining evenings we have had in some time.  This place is perfect for date night or a family event. My one recommendation is don't be in a hurry if you go here, but then again with all it has going on who would be.

This is a family operated place.  They do everything from sales to repair.    After looking hard for a newer jeep grand Cherokee I saw an ad on AutoTrader.com that was the right price.  After a quick call to Craig Arnold and we were on our way from Oro Valley.  When we got to the dealership we were met by the friendly Arnold Family.  The price remained the same as what was quoted on the phone.  After our test drive of the vehicle we were down to doing the paperwork.  This was one of the best car buying experiences we have ever had.      We will definitely return to buy another vehicle from them when it is time.  We would recommend them to anyone trying to buy a vehicle that doesn't want to go through the painful sit down and talk numbers game that most dealers do.  This was a wonderful experience.

Great beer and food.  This time we had the fish and chips.  The fish is battered in a beer batter made with the in house beer.  It was a generous portion and very good.  It is located in a historical building downtown.

We found this place by doing a search on Yelp.  We ordered a Sal's special pizza and an order of bread with cheese.  The food and service was great.  The price was great for what we received.  We will be back when we are in the area.    This place has a lot going for it.  The atmosphere inside is nice and it is like stepping away from the busy area just outside its doors.  It was clean and comfortable and very relaxing.  The service was great and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu.

This is a pre-prepared type of food place.  I got the lasagna and a side of potatoes that were tossed in the microwave and my wife got pizza and bread.  The pizza was placed in the pizza oven to warm it and the bread went into the microwave.  It had a good taste but my food was pretty cool in spots.  I would say it is better tasting than the usual chain pizza places found in the food courts.  It served its purpose but nothing more!

Very poor way to do business!   We found an advertised "internet special' on a Jeep.  We called and confirmed the vehicle and price.  We drove from Tucson and drove the vehicle.  We were ready to write the check (cash deal).  Then the games began.  We were told we did not read the fine print and they had added a paint protection additive (auto butler), a different security system, and had the windows tinted.  The salesman Mike Harding insisted we were going to pay for the items.  We got up and left.  We did end up buying a better jeep and at a better deal than they had to offer at another dealer with "NO BULL".   Just FYI we were told they add this stuff to all of the new vehicles on the lot

This place was the dirtiest restaurant I have even eaten in!    My wife told me how good firehouse subs were so while going to California she wanted to eat here.  We went in and were greeted fast and no one was in line on a Sunday at dinner time (should have been my first clue!)  We ordered our sandwiches and went to get the fountain drinks.  The floor was filthy and had multiple layers of spills on it.  The counter in the drink area also was dirty and had several old spills and trash on it.    I went to try the drink machine and could see lemons or limes inside the drain and other trash in it.  The drink machine needed a wiping down and it also had spills all over it.    We were able to find a table that didn't need too much wiping down so we could eat.  This place was slow and only had one other table with dine-in customers.    I counted 9 employees working and they were not busy.  I can not believe the management or health department could let this place stay open with it being this dirty.   The food was not that good either!

Over the top great service!  We received excellent service while eating dinner here on a Monday night.  The food was great and the drinks were outstanding.    The service  It is nice to eat a restaurant and have a server who knows about the menu and what it tastes like.  We got great info when placing our drink order and then our food order.  We never waited a minute if we needed something.  The chips and salsa were replaced when they got low.      The atmosphere   We ate outside under the large mall entry way covering.  It was comfortable and was good for people watching in the background.  I did mention we ate here on a Monday night and the large screen television allowed us to watch some of the game(even though we both didn't like the teams playing LOL)    The food  I went with a 3 taco plate and tried 3 different tacos.  It was served with beans and rice.  All three were good and my favorite was the diablo shrimp taco.  My wife had the grilled chicken enchilada flat.  We both thought the food was very great.  I was just able to "just' finish everything on my plate and my wife wasn't.  We both left full!    Overall  Having been to the Tucson locations this new one in Chandler is on par with the others.  I had a great tasting margarita and enjoyed the chips and salsa while waiting for our food.  When the food arrived it tasted great.  The automotive garage theme they have going on works.  Outside dining and the ability to watch the game worked.  With the amount of quality food and drink we got the price worked.  If you find yourself wanting Mexican food while at the mall give it a try.  It will not be the typical mall fast food and the quality here will be much better!

Great food.  Good service.  Fun atmosphere to eat in.  With all the other good reviews on this place not much more to say.  Give it a try if you are in the area.  If you are a fan of Italian beef dipped sandwiches you will not be disappointed.
