Generally, Church's is not a place to expect much but it's at least adequate.  My order started off with a broken ordering speaker.  Once I received my order I had to turn around and head back because my sides were wrong.  This was the first time I had actually been inside this store and it stinks like rancid grease.  The staff is apologetic and corrects my order so I leave happy enough.  I then have to return again once I open the giant box of chicken strips, only to find the small, cold hard strips of chicken huddling in one forth of the oversized box.  Once again, I return to the grease pit to have chicken over explained to me by a lady I can only assume was in charge.  Her lack of name tag made it impossible to know who she was, but she was the loudest, rudest person in the shop.  After having a good 45 minutes of my day wasted I left with hot, properly sized chicken.  This place is a relic and needs to be shut down.

I frequent Valle Luna as I am a fan of great Mexican food and I live in the area.  I recently had a simple misunderstanding with a take-out order.  When I brought it to the attention of the hostess she instantly became aggressive taking no accountability only making matters worse.  This started becoming an argument that I didn't want any part of...I had a delicious chicken chimichanga waiting for me and I would rather eat it than argue with a teenager about my order.    ...why am I giving this a 5 star review?  As the owner of a small business with employees I would want to know of issues regardless of size so I called the admin contact.  I know not everything can always go as smoothly as preferred and these are often the moments that you can really tell what a business or person is made of.  The next day and spoke with the owner, Janie with regard to the issue and was pleased.  I wasn't looking for anything, I just wanted the restaurant that I enjoy to continue to be great.  Janie, handled the issue reasonably and professionally and I would tell she had a great deal of concern for her establishments.    Great food and a great commitment to customer service from the top down.

I've purchased and had tailored 5 suits over the past 10 years from Brothers and it had nothing but great experiences.  I have always left feeling that I received a suit worth well more than its price and tailoring that was always properly executed.
