I'm really happy with everything from my visits for my root canal! I saw Dr. Christensen each time. They worked with me on finding a payment plan while my insurance waits to fully kick in. They checked in constantly so I actually experienced no pain once it was numbed.  And the environment is as positive as it gets for getting drilled on lol.  I'm not terrified at all for my upcoming fillings. Honestly, best dentist I can remember seeing!

SUCH a bad experience today!  In the past, the worst that happened, were the ditzy receptionists that called to ask for my payment again.  After I signed a receipt and my insurance covered the rest.  I'd have to call them back and have them double check their records. Yup. Paid.  Today was another level of unprofessional and money needy!  I'm never going back.  I chipped a tooth while snacking on corn nuts like a loser.  Whatever, I have  dentist, so let's just fix it right? So I called Dentistry of Old Town, they said if I made it there by 4:30pm, I could get in.  I told them my private insurance is currently getting reinstated, but I'll pay cash.  It just needs to get fixed so I can go to work tomorrow without half a tooth. Easy, right?  So, I race from 5 hours away from my drive home after visiting family in NV and made it before 4:30pm. After waiting, they took me back and it took them 45 minutes to figure out how I payment works.  After getting the estimate, x-rays, and payment sorted out, they told me I had to leave and come back tomorrow ... The receptionists were useless.  Dr. Bradley was in the room next to me working on someone else.  They don't open until 8am and I needed to be at work with a tooth by 7:30am and they knew this at noon when I made the appointment.    This place is disappointing and everybody who works there is useless.  Don't waste your time and 4 times what you should be paying! It's not worth all the stupidity, poor communication and paying the same bill 10 times.    On a happy note, I found a non fake dentist who accepts payment plans and stays 30 minutes past his "clock out time" for costumer service and to make an extra 1k. The receptionists didn't giggle and knew where they were too, so that was refreshing :)

Organized, clean ... and expensive. For me at least. I can find similar things for less. But quality items and good staff!

I like bar 1! Especially on Thursdays buy 1, get 1 deal. Their drinks are already affordable, so we always save a ton when we go there. Calm but fun atmosphere. A dive but not sleazy and it's clean!

Love Postinos prices, atmosphere and service! I wish they took reservations because it does get so busy and sometimes I can't off of work early enough to get on the patio or a table on a busy night, but everything else is perfect.

I LOVE it here!!! Taylor and D'Lisa are the only waxers I go to in Phoenix. And the atmosphere is laid back and fun every time.  I've literally had everyone there cut and color my hair and I trust all of them :)
