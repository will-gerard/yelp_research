Went here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it was busy, but they seem to know their business well because our food was out within 5 minutes of ordering and tasted fresh.  I come here for the chicken and that did not disappoint.  It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The waffles seemed a little overdone, so I ended up eating only half of it.  I had some mac and cheese which was great, so that made up for the waffle.    The service was prompt and attentive, so no problems there.  However, I don't agree with the 18% gratuity for a group of 5 people, but I'm guessing it's to ensure people tip.  Since the service was great I have no problem paying 18%, but I would prefer that the amount to tip be my decision for a group of less than 7 or 8.

I saw this business on Yelp and wanted to try it out to fix my iPhone due to their great reviews.  Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to so I can't review their repair service.  However, I can rate their professionalism and customer service.  I find it very unprofessional and frustrating for someone to schedule an appointment for 11 AM the next day and not even call to cancel or let me know what's going on.  My wife was told by Miles he would call at 10 AM to confirm our location.  10 AM comes around.  No call.  My wife left him a voice mail with our address.  We waited until 11 AM thinking he might just show up anyway, but he was nowhere to be found.  A simple call letting us know that he wasn't going to be able to make it would have sufficed, but we got nothing.  Since we were quoted $60 for a mobile repair at our apartment we were definitely interested because the price was right and we didn't have to go anywhere.  However, due to our frustration with contacting Miles we decided to take our business elsewhere even though it was $10 more.  Maybe next time I have a problem I'll give them a call, but this left a bad impression to my wife and me.

I just moved into town in March and was looking for a local auto shop since I don't like taking my car to the dealer.  I chose Family Auto Care because of their great reviews on Yelp and Kadzu.  I brought in my Honda Fit since it's approaching 36,000 miles and wanted to get an oil change, tire rotation, brake fluid flush, and just a general inspection.    8:30 AM - Dropped off and got a ride home from Cassandra.  9:49 AM - I received a call from Chuck with a quote of $400+ because the valve cover gasket was leaking, a serpentine belt needed to be replaced, and I needed to replace the air filter and cabin air filter.  I mentioned I had both air filters and Chuck gave me another quote for $318.  I also mentioned I had 5 quarts of oil, an oil filter, and a new oil drain plug in the back.  Chuck said they would use that and quoted me $300.    Chuck was upfront about the fact that they would be waiting on one of the parts from the Honda dealer in Phoenix which wouldn't arrive until 2 or 3 PM.  This wasn't a problem for me since it's my day off and I had no plans.  The important thing was making sure my car was taken care of and I appreciated being informed of that delay.  4:10 PM - I called and Cassandra told me they were finishing up and were about to take it on a test drive.    4:35 PM - Cassandra came by and picked me up at home.  I'm very happy with their service, honesty, and the courtesy of dropping me off and picking me up at home.  I will definitely be coming back in the future.    The only thing I forgot to do was use my 10% Yelp coupon for First Time Service, but that was my fault so it's okay.

I took my iPhone 4 here yesterday after the dock connector got messed up and I wasn't able to charge it.  They went through their pre-test and had me sign off on the repairs.  I asked if they would have it done by the end of business (7 PM) and although they didn't guarantee it (which is a good business move) they did end up getting it done in about an hour.  They replaced the dock for $69 and everything works as it should again.

I think I've been here 3 times already and just never got around to writing a review.  My wife found this place through Yelp, so we decided to give it a try.  The first time I had sea salt caramel and dark chocolate.  To this day that combo is still my favorite.  The other times I've visited I tried the mango, pineapple, and kiwi sorbets.  I loved all 3 of those as well especially the kiwi.  This is our family's go-to dessert spot whenever we feel like some gelato.  It's about 10 minutes away, so it's not from us at all.

Brakes were squeaking, so I found this place on Yelp with a lot of good reviews.  I figured it was worth a shot since it's close to home.  My first impression was how clean and organized the garage looked.  Kurt was very friendly, had my Honda Fit brought in relatively quickly, quoted us a reasonable price, told us it would be an 60-90 minutes, then offered a vehicle for us to borrow while the work was being done.  The waiting area isn't very large and they have a TV in there, so we took the vehicle and got some errands done while waiting.  We came back to get my car with the new brakes installed, used a Yelp deal to save some money, and not once was I offered an upsell on anything while I was there.  They did what I asked and were honest about what they would do and how long it would take.  I'll definitely be back.

We were in downtown Chandler and looking for somewhere to eat.  We've passed the place a couple times before driving, so we decided to check it out today.  The smell of fresh bread when you walk in is amazing, so that was definitely a great first impression.  I had the 12" Super Hero and I thought it was great.  The bread was fresh and the meats and cheese in the sandwich were just the right amount.  My wife had the Green Turkey.  She was very happy that they had sprouts available to put on sandwiches and liked that their bread was whole wheat.  The kids just had basic ham and american and turkey and american sandwiches from the kids menu.  They weren't anything special, but they enjoyed them and finished their food.  That's all I can ask for.  We're not often in the mood for sandwiches, but when we are this is definitely a place we'll go to again especially if we're in the area.

Arrived in town on March 22.  I had a feeling this was a hot, new spot because a couple friends were checking in here 2-3 times a week.  My friend Michael T. mentioned we'd stop by when I got hungry.  It was a great way to end my first day in town.  I ordered the seasoned wings, sweet potato fries, and a grape Kool-Aid.  The wings were crispy, meaty, and seasoned perfectly.  You could tell they were cooked fresh.    The same could be said about the sweet potato fries.  They were fresh and crispy.  Washing that all down with grape Kool-aid just made everything better.  The Kool-Aid is a little spendy at $2.99, but you get free refills so drink away.  I will definitely be frequenting this place on a regular basis.  I'm looking forward to trying out the other wing flavors and other stuff on the menu.
