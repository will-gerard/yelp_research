The worst ever...not even scary...too large of groups being let in to the so called haunted houses at a time. Ok maybe if you had a small young family but hardly a adult scare. It was set up like a small fair with fair food and snacks... It's poorly ran and cops were everywhere , mainly because parents just drop off the Pre-teens and lets them run around .... So no I won't be going back to a un scary mall for kids. Not my idea of a good time. Also the corn maze isn't haunted so... Yeah blah money wasted.

Great Haunt !!! Entrance is a bit odd and location inside a go cart racing track... But put all that aside this is a nice scary one folks. Tons of actors! And super dark rooms make for a good time .

New favorite pizza place in town!  As a cubby kid I like good pizza with all the bad stuff on it. And they know how I like it! Btw the cookies are yum too! I ordered by phone and picked up so this review is solely based on TAKE OUT.  The wait was a bit long when I got there but worth it! It's a popular place so a little wait isn't that big of a deal, esp. When it's good and a fair price! And don't the cookies.

Feeling "pretty fly for a fat guy" anyways...I've been coming to this barbershop for about 6 months. I'd rather wait before I write a review until I've lived the experience. I get my haircut on a regular basis about ever 2.5 weeks or so. I enjoy coming here, Ronnie always makes you feel welcome and greeted as well as the other barbers. I've been cut by everyone in the shop "I do have a fav. Shawn" But I'm comfortable with getting my haircut from anyone he employs. Ive had a shave done and beard trim at one or more visits. It's just a nice chill neighborhood barbershop with great customer service and stupid humor most times. And if you are feeling it a cold beer....so yeah i stand by my first statement ...... Fly for a fat guy! Keep up the great job Uptown Barber.  And I'm a picky one folks. .

Dear Jackson's car wash on 20th st and Highland ..... If you don't know how to detail a car with clay bar wax job DONT OFFER THE SERVICE!!! When I have to walk around and wipe off inside of Windows and other parts of the car myself that were missed in this "$400" service , you people have lost your minds ... No different than crappy the service provided by the previous ownership!  "Danny's " Worthless Sub par!!! Please people stop using them Not nearly worth the money. They have failed the audition for my business .   What a damn joke...full detail, inside and out and clay bar wax. I wish I could give them zero stars .
