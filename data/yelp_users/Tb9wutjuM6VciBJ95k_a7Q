Beautiful view is all they got going for them. We took our family from New York here. The view was fabulous and the story ends pretty much there if you want to hear good reviews. The food was horrible!!! We all got something different so four people can't be wrong. The server was the worst I have ever seen. Ok so if you know you are busy why don't you update your guests instead of ignoring them knowing that you are busy and won't be able to get to them as much as you would like. Our food took two hours to get to us. I was told it was because of the huge party upstairs. Hmmm well what about the two tables that walked in 45 minutes after us. And got their food 30 mintues before us. Yes that's because their server didn't suck and forget to ring in the food. Then the manager came over and said we will comp you a bottle of wine perfect thank you. But when we tell you how long the food has taken. He argued and said it has been only a hour. And I said yes it has that's when your server remembered to type in the order so that is the time you have on the ticket that gets printed to the kitchen. The table next to us was also pissed and yelling at the server. Get it together!! Your food sucks and so does your service. Well our server any way. Go for bar and views nothing else.

Absolutely amazing street tacos! You can't beat $1 tacos on Tuesday and happy hour margaritas!

Love love this place! Tacos are legit and I love the outside bar and umbrella seats. They brought in sand to make you feel like you are really in Mexico.

Horrible service, felt dirty everywhere and the food was greasy and bland. As an Arizona native that has tried every Mexican restaurant in the valley this was by far the worst!

Great veg place. I take all my friends that wouldn't dare to go vegetarian here and they all love it. When you can take your friends that eats meat and only full fat dairy products and they like it you know it's good. You can't go wrong with the bbq,parm, or steak sandwich. All the Ice creams are to die for. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the chilli burger. That is the only thing out of everything I have tried that I didn't care for. But everything else rocks.

I went here 5 years ago and was in the best shape if my life. I now bring my daughter and it has changed her life. She is so positive and it gives her the self confidence I always knew she had. Thanks Iron Gloves!

I love the atmosphere on weekends with the DJ. Now when I say DJ I'm talking about good beats playing in the background when your dinning. Not a club atmosphere with dancing going on everywhere. Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well. Nate was our server he did an amazing job. Decor fits what they are trying to accomplish swanky with a bit of lounge atmosphere.  I gave this a five because it had all the elements that I like in a restaurant.

Love this Grungy bar that I call home to the 90's. They have amazing craft beer always on tap. You can always step back in time and tie a flannel around your waste with a hemp choker chain and jam out to Pearl Jam cover bands. Or you can come across a diamond in the ruff and watch someone like Alice Copper's son playing here trying to catch a break.  Very hip cool fun place!

Specialty martini's even though they are 18 bucks they are to die for and plus they give you the martini shaker so it really makes two in a half martinis. Crab legs are sawed open for you no trying to pick them out with those tiny forks. Amazing ceasar wasabi blue cheese salad! Everything is amazing!

I usually start off by raving about food and drinks, but this time I'm going to rave about Alexandra. The most knowledgable food connoisseur I have ever met in all my dining experience. She needs to be a Brand Ambassador for a restaurant. She pronounced every type of delicacy with the correct accent. Truly an amazing dining experience.

Came here for happy hour with my boyfriend. Didn't know they had craft beer he was stoked about that. Pretty much the place is on the water, happy hour seven days a week and reverse. They have cool backyard games like Cornhole, darts and complimentary boat rides. Our new fav place!

My BF and I were looking for a killer happy hour spot and we ran across The Beverly. $6 hand crafted cocktails that were delish! I had the Old Fashioned that came out perfect! Our bartender Stevie was so helpful with picking which classic cocktail would suit our palets best. She hit it on the dot! Then we tried the Cabot wings with blue cheese cream and truffle fries... YUM!!

Great place for my kids to train with actual pro athletes. They have football, basketball and baseball. The coaches are mentors on top of everything else.

Umm nothing but delicious! I brought my two friends here from out of town. They were ecstatic that they could try every local craft brew under one roof! Not to mention the brick oven neapolitan pizza.  Definitely my favorite spot in Old Town Scottsdale
