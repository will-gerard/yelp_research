Now this is the kind of place I could really dig. It's a little bit divey, but still warm and inviting. My first visit there I got a greeting and handshake from the owner. The bartender was all smiles and friendliness. Every single person in there (and it was quite a diverse crowd) was enjoying themselves and just having a jolly old time.  On top of that, prices are great, they've got what looks to be a pretty nice pool table, and I hear they have steel tip darts. How can you go wrong there? I'll have to make a few return runs up here, for sure!

In the first two days of discovering Croque... I had eaten there twice. While I've been looking for new places to eat in the area, this one quickly sucked me in. On the second day, I also got two co-workers to eat there, and I think this is quickly becoming a Croque office.  I've now had a number of their sandwiches, including their bugolki sandwich (on multi-grain with the garlic spread) and the chicken pesto club (on white with their remoulade) and both are absolutely delicious. Very different sandwiches, but each is great in its own right. Unwrapping these sandwiches alone is enough to get you salivating. The scent is irresistible! Add fresh, quality ingredients hand assembled while you wait, and you've got a winner. I was even eating some of the remoulade straight out of the side container they gave me, that's how good this stuff is!  I also tried out their teriyaki chicken lunch bowl... YUM!  Matter of fact, I'm getting hungry again just writing this...

I've got something of a love affair with this place. It's becoming a regular part of my life now... and I am okay with that.  In the past, I would go here for lunch... their freshly made sandwiches are absolutely delicious. Given that I now work about 25 miles from here, that's somewhat... difficult. So instead I now go here after my early morning South Mountain hikes. Turns out their smoothies are quite fantastic as well. I believe the general consensus amongst my friends and I has been "heaven in our mouths."  On top of that, their selection of local produce and related products is unrivaled. Delicious fresh fruit (of which they're usually handing out samples), local honey, locally made salad dressings, salsas, jams, and much much more, make this place to die for. I get all of my best fruit here, without a doubt.  One thing to note though is that you should bring cash here! There is a small additional charge for paying with your credit card, as it's expensive for them to process.

I have been a loyal customer of Sakana for some time now, and have made converts of many other people as well. Every single visit is a great experience; the staff is fast and friendly, the sushi chefs are artists of their craft, and the food is amazing!  The fish they get is some of the freshest I have ever eaten, and they get some amazing variety as well! The whiteboard up behind the sushi bar is always listing their latest specials, and that's usually where I do most of my ordering from. Of course, if I can't decide what to eat, the sushi chefs are always more than willing to make some creative suggestions.

This is the third of the Sakana locations I have been to, and they have yet to disappoint once! Given that I work in the area, this is a prime spot for me to grab a quick lunch. And given their prices it's absolutely one of the best (and most delicious!) values to be found!  For $11.99 I got the sashimi deluxe lunch. This had 3 pieces each of: salmon, albacore tuna, Fiji albacore and lightly seared white tuna. All of the slices were very generously cut and every piece was perfectly fresh, as I have come to expect from Sakana. Even the salmon was rich and buttery, without a hint of the "fishy" taste that salmon so often has. The also came with miso soup, a small salad and a bowl of steamed rice.  Overall, this was a decently filling meal without leaving me with that overstuffed feeling. Everything tasted great. Plus, this is one of the healthier options you can find for a quick lunch. Oh and there's the fact that every member of the staff was absolutely delightful, welcome and helpful! Always a bonus on top of great food.

I'm lucky enough to work only about a mile from this place... so any time I can't decide on what to eat, this is the instant fallback. I have never had one bad item from the menu, and I've eaten most of it.  One of my favorite things about their food, aside from the fact that it always comes out delicious, is that when you ask for something "extra spicy"... they can actually bring it! Not "melt your face off" spicy, mind you. But it's at least a nice tingle spicy. Most places can't even get that right!  Bottom line is, if you're looking for something quick, tasty and not too expensive, go here.

Holy monkeys, I didn't expect this to happen, but my opinion of this place just increased in an explosion of "YAY"ness!  I've been going there for some time now... probably nigh on a year. Somehow, in all this time of getting lunches there, I managed to overlook the roasted pork with plum sauce. NO LONGER will I make such a mistake! I feel like I have an orgy of flavor in my mouth right now. Seriously, this is good. I don't know what they did to it. Maybe I'm delusional. Maybe I'm just really really hungry.... whatever it is, I am in love with this food right now.  Mmmmm, back to nomming....

Two stars does feel a bit harsh for rating this place, but the description fits perfectly. "Meh. I've experienced better." Three stars would be "A-OK," which I don't feel describes my experience here at all.  It's not that anything was particularly bad or offensive. It just wasn't great. The roll I got before eating was harder than I would have liked, but the pesto/olive oil that came with it was quite pleasant. On the recommendation of the server, I got one of their chef's special dishes, the Ciambotta Di Pollo e Salsiccia. Again, nothing was wrong with it. It was good and I plowed my way through it quickly. However, it was far from gourmet. The sauce, while it tasted fine, was hardly distinguishable from something from a jar. The chicken and peppers were roughly cut in all sizes. Then the biggest problem with the whole experience was the price. For my lunch of only iced tea and an entree, I paid just over $20 after tax and tip. Now I don't have a problem with paying $20 for a meal, not at all. But for that price, I expect quality. What I got did not at all match up with that expectation.  I have nothing against this restaurant. I wasn't at all put off by the meal. But I can get better at Olive Garden for a lower price. I can call to mind several family-owned Italian restaurants with higher quality and lower prices. So I'll be taking my money to those.

I really like The Corner Deli. Sure, I don't love them. But that's okay, I'll keep coming back anyways! They're a great little deli with simple, tasty food and nice people. Nothing fancy about it, but that's part of what's so good.  Of course I'm sure it helps that I work just down the street. Easy access = easily drawn in.

I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with REI.  You see, I really love this place. They've got great products. They have sales all the time on things which are already very fairly priced. They always have what I need. And I've become friends with a lot of the staff, because... well, they're just awesome people and I see them outside all the time, using and abusing the very gear that they're selling.  So why do I hate this place? Because I spend way too much money here. Seriously. I have to force myself to stay away. It's rare that I'll walk out of here spending less than $100. I see one thing that I need... then think of something else... then see another toy... and before I know it, I've forgotten what I originally came for and picked up 10 other things.  So I guess what it comes down to is, this place is almost too good for its own sake.

I'm all about eating local, supporting small business and all that... I never thought I could become a fan of such a corporatey chain as Applebee's... but it truly is the staff that makes the place.  Everybody here is super friendly. Robert is a fantastic bartender, and hardly ever short on ideas for new drinks. On top of all that, they've got karaoke on Tuesday nights that is a blast! Yes, you read that right. Karaoke at Applebee's. Crazy, I know, but lots of fun regardless.  Oh yeah and their shredded pork wonton tacos... YUM!

I'll admit, I was a little skeptical when I heard "chicken and waffles". It's just a curious combination, especially having grown up in the Northwest. This idea is all new to me.  Then my food arrived. I was no longer a skeptic. I could swear I had a full half of a chicken in my three pieces, and they were smothered in some delicious form of gravy, which I could have just as easily poured straight down my gullet. The chicken was cooked to perfection, as were the waffles. Even having everything mixed together on one plate which could barely contain all of that food didn't deter me one bit.  I do not have a single complaint about this place. Everything was amazing.

I love Wong's Place. I always have. How I never wrote a review about it before, I have no idea! I've been going here for around 10 years and have never been disappointed. Despite living in South Phoenix, I still make a point to come to Tempe from time to time just to visit Wong's Place. It's well worth the drive.  As to what to eat here, well... everything! My personal favorites are the Wong Jo and House Special chicken dishes, but I've had nearly everything on the menu and loved all of it.  Also, like Nader said, get the blue menu!

I tried to like this place. I really did. I heard so much good about this place, from people whose taste I trust. The experience itself was enjoyable. A very nice atmosphere. It was all so promising.  So following my normal habits, my friend and I sat at the sushi bar and asked the sushi chef to simply feed me what he would like, "omakase" style. He seemed happy enough about this... and made some fairly tasty rolls, albeit nothing extravagant and all pretty basic items from the menu. Given that I told him the only thing I wouldn't eat was octopus, I somewhat expected him to be a little more creative. Generally that is what's to be expected from omakase. But, this was my first time there, so it was excusable. He didn't know my taste.  We ended up having 4 rolls in all, and then when I was about ready to ask for some sashimi to finish up, he hands us some nigiri; 2 pieces each of salmon and ahi tuna. Okay, cool, that works just as well. This is his choice, after all. Unfortunately this is where the low rating comes from. I entrusted him to showcase his selection.... and this fish he gave me was not fresh. It was slimy. It had hardly any flavor at all; the predominant flavors came from the rice and the tiny dab of wasabi binding the fish to it. I had to wash both pieces of nigiri down with water and tea.  To me, the true measure of a sushi restaurant is in its sashimi and/or nigiri. And this is unfortunately where Sushi Eye fell flat on its face in my experience. Perhaps I've been spoiled at other restaurants, but I can't see myself returning here to try again. I'll go where I know the fish is fresh and flavorful.

Alright, another chain restaurant. Chipotle is Chipotle no matter where you go. They win on consistency.  What makes this one in particular stand out is the only thing that's different here: The people. Fast and friendly very aptly describes them. As far as speed, when business is slow, I'm pretty sure I've managed to be in and out of this place in less than a minute. It was kinda crazy. That was even including smiles and a couple jokes. Seriously, who can manage that?  I'm definitely glad this is right by my work. It makes for a great quick lunch grab!

I can honestly say, eating here was the worst dining experience I have ever had. I've been to worse places. I've dealt with worse service. But bundle together the entire experience of the evening and top it with the hefty price tag for a bow and you've got something you would wish on nobody.  I had high hopes for this place, really I did. I recall going for lunch a couple of times when they were Fogo E Brasa, and they were very good. Something changed. We saw our server (who turned out to be the manager...) only once, meaning no drink refills. The person bringing the meats around could best be describe as a "meat pusher"; he would butt his way into our conversations, mumble what he had, then start sawing, without asking if we wanted any. The meat was inconsistently bad... I saw everything from overcooked to the point of burning, to something that looked like it was in the pan for no more than 15 seconds. Add to that an apparent total lack of seasoning and you get a rather unappetizing meal.  For this lovely experience, we were charged $31 each, not including any drinks or desserts. This is the first time I honestly considered walking out on a check. I will never be returning here, and am making sure to spread the word of just how bad that dinner was. I actually went to Applebees afterward to get some better food in me. Yes, Applebees was better.

I was very happy with the food here; I got a full size rice bowl, and it made for two very large meals, all for about $9. Can't beat that with a stick.  On top of that, it was super tasty. Although, don't go there expecting any spice. At all. Even their "spicy teriyaki" sauce didn't have so much as a hint of spice.  This will definitely be added to my list of lunch spots in the area.

Alright, so this place may have a bit of an unfair advantage in my book. Why? Well first of all, I'm a fan of dive bars. Second, I love karaoke. Add to that their monthly "costume" days (They've done trailer trash night, "Sunday Best" on Easter, Halloween costume contest, etc) and I'm going to be a fan.  Now granted, the menu is rather schizophrenic. It doesn't know what it's trying to be. But the food that is available on there is actually pretty tasty and well priced. It's a dive bar, though. You can't go there expecting spectacular gourmet. Or at least, I wouldn't. I go there expecting cold beer, friendly faces and bar food.  Plus the aforementioned karaoke is a blast. Thursday nights. 8pm. Be there. So much fun! :-D

The only negative thing I could possibly say about this Spinato's is that it's just too far from my office. Any time I want to eat there for lunch, I have to get take out and come eat it at my desk. And let me tell you, driving back and smelling that pizza in the passenger seat next to me is pure torture. But maybe that's all a good thing... at least it keeps me from going there every day.  Apart from having the best pizza I've ever had the chance to nom on (and I've had quite a lot of pizza in my time,) the staff here is simply fantastic. They treat everybody like a friend or member of the family. All smiles, super pleasant, eager to do whatever they can to make sure that you are having a wonderful day. It's not even out of the ordinary to see the GM walking around, sweeping, making sure everybody is comfortable and being just ridiculously pleasant.  I really do love this place. That's all there is to it.

Okay so we all know what to expect from Starbucks. The selection is the same. So what it really comes down to is the staff. And this location happens to have superb staff. I always end up leaving this place with a smile on my face, regardless if I'm having a grumpy, frumpy morning. I'm sure the fact that I'm leaving with a giant cup of caffeine helps with that... but the people working the drive-thru are always quick with a smile and laugh, and seem to genuinely want to spread those smiles to the customer.

When somebody says "breakfast in Phoenix," this place instantly jumps to the top of my mind.  I'm always shocked when I hear that people have lived in Phoenix and never been here and some never heard of it. I suppose this truly is a "hidden gem" as people say. I generally make a point of taking any visiting friends or family here at least once. It really can't be beat; from the food, to the servers, to the whole ambiance, Morning Glory is top notch.  The entire place is outdoors, in the shade of large, beautiful trees. The food is made from fresh, local ingredients. Families and friends are sitting around enjoying the experience. People bike up, and some even bring their dogs. Local vendors can be seen at times selling honey, jam, oil, bread and music unobtrusively in the yard. You can even see and walk over to the gardens and chicken coops where some of the wonderful ingredients come from!  I hope this place never changes.

I was seriously underwhelmed by this restaurant. Granted, I was a bit wary to even go here when I heard "all you can eat sushi" -- that almost never goes well -- but my friends were quite insistent on going.  True to what I expected, there was nothing particularly positive to report about this restaurant. Everything is designed to get you in and out with as little fish in you as they can manage. You are limited to one serving (2 slices) of nigiri. I didn't even see an option for sashimi, which is generally the majority of what I eat. All of the rolls were made mostly of rice, with very little filling -- again, a tactic to fill you up quickly. The rolls were very loose and fell apart easily. What little fish I did actually get was certainly not up to the standards of freshness that I expect.  Overall, my experience here was only memorable in the fact that I will remember not to return.

I can't help but love this place. I've been going here since, quite literally, the day the opened. I move further away and I keep coming back.  The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, the beer selection constantly rotates to new and interesting beers... and this is basically the de-facto hangout for climbers and cyclists! Really can't go wrong with this place.

Ding! Approved.  Okay okay, it's not Cibo or Bianco. But really, should you be expecting that? Given the price, speed and great service, this place is absolutely worth it. The staff is young, friendly, energetic and welcoming. The menu is focused and food well prepared. Quality ingredients are used to make for a tasty light lunch. Everything is served up very quickly and with a big smile.  This is definitely going in my regular rotation of lunch spots!

Food: Delicious, with generous portions Service: Deplorable  First, the good: I had chicken marsala, which came with two full chicken breasts cooked to perfection and a massive pile of pasta. Put a fancy presentation on this dish and I would expect I was eating at an expensive gourmet restaurant. One friend got a large antipasto salad which... well, large doesn't even begin to cover it. This salad was big enough to choke a hippo. The pizzas also looked very tasty, and got great review from everybody at the table. Honestly, the food itself deserves a higher rating, but the service was bad enough to drag this all the way down.  Now on to the bad. Most of our time there, the entire staff was too busy watching the football game to be bothered paying attention to the customers. Personally, I had to ask for water multiple times and had to get a set of utensils from a friend, as the server forgot to bring a set after I asked (shouldn't they have been provided without asking?) Oh and the real icing on the cake: I asked to get a box for my food, so the server was kind enough to go box it up herself. And then forget about it. I actually had to ask for my food back several minutes later as we were getting ready to leave.  I'm going to have to mark this place off as a "Do Not Return".

Fantabulous! That's the best way I can describe the food here.  I really wanted to get a photo of my dish, because it was a work of art, despite just being pasta et al piled onto a plate. Unfortunately, between my hunger and the amazing aroma wafting off the plate, the camera never made it out. This dish, by the way, was the strozzapreti. I could go on about how wonderful it was, but I'll spare the reader. Oh, there were also the Zucca chips. I nearly bit the waiter's hand off when he tried to remove the scraps.  In truth, I would love to give this place 5 stars. The food, without a doubt, warrants that rating. However, the place was pretentious to the point that it was palpable. The acoustics of the restaurant made for a very loud experience. Oh and the server was actually a bit too attentive. She was great, very nice, on top of everything... but just a little too much.  Overall I'd like to go again and try out some more of what they have to offer! (And of course, have more zucca chips...)

Let me start out by stating that I am not vegetarian or vegan. I will eat (or at least try) anything. That being said, this food was amazing.  I had their Spicy Lemongrass Tofu (extra spicy!) with brown rice, and I could not find a single thing wrong with the dish. Being a lunch special ($8 for a perfect portion -- amazing, right?) it came with the rice (no upcharge for brown!) and a salad. The dressing on the salad was just right; not too bold, not too bland, just delicious. Then the main meal... wow. First off, I was impressed by the spice, which doesn't happen often. I'll eat some crazy spicy things, so when I ask for "extra spicy," I want them to bring the heat... and bring it they did! Now I'm not saying this was nuclear hot. It was, again, just right. A couple beads of sweat formed on my forehead, but it didn't interrupt the flavor at all or leave my mouth feeling like Death Valley. Moving on from that, the flavor was incredible, the portion was just the right amount to fill me up; I could not find a single flaw with the food.  The only warning I will give is, beware the lunch rush! This place is small and has great food, which means it *will* fill up! This can make service a little bit slow at times when they get overwhelmed, but it is well worth the wait if you've got the time.

I love ClimbMax! I've been a member here, off and on, for over 2 years now. They have, hands down, the best bouldering of any gym in the Phoenix area. It is absolutely huge! I mean come on, you can boulder all the way up through a cave from the first to the second floor. How do you beat that?  Also, recently the ratings for the rope routes have changed to be by community consensus. This appears to be making for fairer, more consistent and stiffer ratings. This place is constantly improving, taking into consideration customer feedback and growing as a gym and as a community.  ClimbMax is absolutely my top choice for indoor climbing in Phoenix.

I have to apologize to all of my Tempe bars. I... may have to cheat on you a bit. I think I've fallen for SideBar. The crazy part is, I wasn't even drinking the night I went in here! Yeah I know. Me, not drinking. Weird right?  Perhaps it was partially the mix of non-drinking and a shelf full of great Scotch which I can't wait to tour. Or the couches that were comfy enough I may as well have been drunk. Maybe the great selection of craft beers they had stowed behind the bar. What finally won me over, however, was when I saw Metropolis come up on the TVs! At that moment, I knew it was true love. And yes, I do mean the 1927 silent movie. Don't judge.  But the next time I am there it will be love mixed with a healthy dose of Scotch. Oh yes, Scotch... mmmmm.

I love my car. Perhaps to an unhealthy level. I just have to put that out on the table immediately in attempt to add some weight to the following statements.  Since I found Goodspeed, when I am working on my car, I look to Goodspeed first. I go here for my oil and filters (They've got Motul oil. Simply the best!) I went here when I had trouble with my air intake and they helped me sort it out. When I started getting a check engine light related to my turbo, I went in here with my suspicions of the cause. I talked to Jon for a couple minutes to describe the problem, he reached under the counter, pulled out a part and said "This is what you need right here." And guess what? He was right!  I will continue referring my friends here, and going here for all my needs, most especially when I start doing more serious tuning of my car. I may live 30 miles away, but it's absolutely worth the trek.

I must admit, I had high hopes for this place... and given the posh, upscale atmosphere, I was ready to be wowed. The only "wow" I had, however, was at how disappointed I was.  The food was far from spectacular; my Caesar salad had very little flavor (even for a Caesar salad,) and my eggplant pomodoro had just barely enough sauce to get some with each bite. The flavor on this, as well, was somewhat lacking. The spaghettini which came with it, however, was well presented and had a nice fresh flavor.  Then, of course, there was the service. I would highly recommend NOT going here for a quick lunch. We ended up being there for nearly two hours, 30 minutes of which was waiting for our check. In addition, the server was rather brusque when my friend asked for recommendations.  Overall, definitely not impressed. For as lavish as the decor is, and given the prices on the menu, I was expecting far better. Most certainly not recommended.

I feel sorry for the new owners of this place that all the reviews are so old. I never went in before this ownership, but I was in there today and I was thoroughly impressed.  I'm no fool when it comes to cars; I've been doing all my own service on my Jetta for the past 100k miles and even put in a few thousand dollars worth of performance parts myself. Needless to say, I'm a bit nervous about having somebody else under the hood of my car. Here though, they didn't try to BS me at all. They got right to the point of what was wrong (an A/C hose was busted) and even took me back in the shop to show me. Quick and easy. They also mentioned that two of my tires were low on tread (they really are -- I mean, real low) but they didn't push hard to sell me on new ones.  Overall a very pleasant experience. Plus as an added bonus, Richard, the guy running the shop, has got a fantastic mustache and great attitude to go with it. That alone deserves a star, I'd say!

Lora is, without a doubt, one of the best massage therapists I have ever been to. And I've been to a lot! She's got over 12 years experience (so far) and it shows. She always manages to work out any problems I bring up.. and will even find problem spots that I hadn't even noticed before.  All the big name massage spas and whatnot may be a little cheaper, but you don't get anywhere near the quality that you get here. I'm more than willing to fork over a few extra dollars for a massage that blows away even the "top notch" resort spa massages I've had!

Situated in a slightly less than desirable area, tucked back amongst some old mini warehouse shops, I will not deny that this place looks shady as hell. I was a bit worried about leaving my car out front.  Regardless of the looks of the place, they do one hell of a job! The shop is run by great, friendly guys who works quickly and won't just try to gouge you at every opportunity. Very few people are allowed under the hood of my VW, but these guys, being the specialist they are, have got carte blanche. If I run into a large task that's just too much to handle on my own, these are the guys I will turn to.

I seriously can't find a single problem with this place. Except that maybe enough people don't know about it yet. They're family owned an operated. The staff is super friendly. The food is delicious with very generous portions. The beer selection is amazing. The atmosphere is totally chill, like a great neighborhood bar should be. Seriously, what more could you ask for? It's a bit off my usual path, but I have no problem going out of my way to return to this place. Highly recommended.

I was very happy with my visit to Perk. Recently, one of my co-workers came in to work raving about the breakfast he had at Perk, insisting I try them out as well. Well I figure, who am I turn down such an endorsement? I couldn't be happier that I listened to him.  First off, the atmosphere. This felt to me just like sitting around at a table at home with the family for a good old home cooked breakfast. The staff were all extremely friendly and good humored. All the patrons were relaxed and smiling. Everything was just right.  Then we get the food... not only did it come out very quickly, but wow was it great. I actually had a lot of trouble deciding from the menu, everything looked so good. So I decided to go with a special the waitress mentioned which wasn't on the menu; biscuits and gravy. Simply put: wow. I may have had better gravy before, but I honestly can't remember when. I was in love from the first bite. The portion was absolutely perfect as well. I finished up my breakfast and was quite full, without being too stuffed.  Needless to say I will be returning here. This has become my new breakfast joint in the area. Even for lunch. Because breakfast food is great any time of the day.

I'm seriously in love with Otaku. I crave this place, frequently. As evidence of my love for this place, in their first 3 months of opening I went there about 10 times, and I live 30 miles away. Perhaps "obsessed" is a better term here.  In addition to the above, I actually followed the sushi chef, Jay Chung, from his previous sushi joint. Turns out, this place was basically built for him, and for good reason! Better sushi is hard to come by, especially in the Phoenix metro!  My favorite option here is sitting at the sushi bar and ordering "omakase," or "chef's choice." Essentially, you just sit down and let the chefs get creative. They'll feed you anything and everything. I have yet to be disappointed with this option, and I am constantly wowed with what they create. The rolls are delicious and many are quite unique, with a great balance of rice, fish and filling. My poison, however, is sashimi. I would kill for a nice slice of tasty, fresh, raw fish. And Otaku does not fail here. In fact, they get some of the freshest sashimi I have ever had; it's truly impressive.  So if you go here, don't just have a california roll or something equally dull. Be brave, try something new, ask for recommendations, or just let the chefs feed you -- you will not be disappointed!

I'm definitely a fan of this place. It's become a regular lunch spot for me; usually at least once a week. I kept hearing about their burger from my co-workers, and they were absolutely right about it: It's delicious!  They have a nice selection of beers, the staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is very open and welcoming. The only detractor I found was that the prices are a bit higher than I'm used to. Given that this is the Scottsdale Quarter, however, the prices are certainly not out of line.

I am a convert, 100%. Both to acupuncture and to Mayo's practice in particular. Since my first visit, I have been urging my friends to get in here, for whatever might ail them.   Mayo has been able to help me with a number of problems I've had. The big one is my right shoulder, which had lost most of its range of motion due to pain, and is now becoming as strong as ever. On one occasion, I came in, completely drained of energy and was giddy as all get out, practically bouncing off the walls when I left. She was even able to ward off a migraine, when all medicine I've ever tried has failed!  Combine Mayo's proficiency with her warm attitude and the open, welcoming feel of this studio, and I can't help but want to return here.

So I see all these negative reviews and, rather than deterring me from going back to Capriotti's, what are my thoughts? "Great, shorter lines for me!" Really, no joke.  Okay so in all fairness I only ever eat one thing here. Which never happens. Ever. Here though, I always get the Cran Slam Club, and it never, ever fails to satisfy. I think I may have tried something else at a different location years ago... but since I tried that club, there's been no going back.  Oh and to the person complaining about a limited selection of chips, quick tip: Go to the counter where you ordered...... look down. You're welcome. :-)

I went into Lucky Break last night for their second night of operation, and they already had several people who looked like they were at home there. I must admit, by the end of the night, I was starting to feel that way myself. They seem to really have things figured out from the get-go, which is actually quite a surprise to me!  Walking in, my first impression is just how clean this place is. Seriously, it's nice. They've got brand new huge TVs all over, showing every game you could want to watch. There's more than enough table and bar space for a large happy hour crowd. The place also has a very nice open feeling that's very welcoming. Also, they have 6 nice new pool tables, which are rented by the hour. Everything you would expect from a place called "Lucky Break" and then some.  Oh yeah then there's the bar. Coming into a billiards joint, I expect to see just your typical domestic beers, along with maybe Guinness as their "fancy" beer. Okay well they do have those. Then there's the craft beer. With 24 taps in total their selection is nothing to thumb your nose at. There are a good number of local AZ beers and some beers that you won't even see at most craft beer bars!  This place is just pure danger for me. Quality pool tables, great beer, and oh yeah the food is pretty damn good too.

I will warn right off, I may be slightly biased in my opinion of this place, because of my incredibly pleasant first visit here. Is that such a bad thing though?  When I first arrived and seated myself at the bar, I was surprised to find that there were 3 people seated at the bar who I knew. Then lo and behold, I knew the bartender as well! Naturally, this resulted in a rather warm greeting and an instant level of comfort.  Next up was to get a good look at the beer list, which I had already heard many positive things about, despite this place only having been open for a couple of weeks. I must admit, their selection is rather impressive; unfortunately, it is Scottsdale prices. This means that each beer has been marked up a few dollars extra on top of your typical bar prices. It's not enough to steer me away from the place, but enough to elicit a bit of a cringe when the bill arrives. I ended up having a couple of very delicious German and Belgian beers, a couple of which I had (amazingly) never had before.  Finally, the thing that thie place is named and known for: their bratwurst. I was a little unsure what all they could do with bratwurst to make an entire restaurant concept out of it. Well let me tell you, they pulled it off brilliantly. I had a DUCK bratwurst and I was not in the least disappointed. A friend of mine also had a "rabbit & hops" bratwurst which he claimed was tasty. At some point I want to go back and give the rattlesnake bratwurst a shot. That selection is certainly enough to keep the curious coming back! I just need to save up a few dollars to cover the cost of the beers...

The two most important words to remember when going here are: Moscow mule.  Forget everything else; that's what you want. The jukebox has issues, as others have noted. The beer selection is decent, but there is far better in near proximity. The food is decent, but nothing to keep me coming back. What will keep me coming back, however, is the moscow mules. The first few I had there were made with cucumber vodka, and hot damn were they tasty! On another visit, I had a couple made with a vodka infused with mint and I can't even remember what else which one of the bartenders made herself.  Oh yes, speaking of the bartenders, they are awesome. Be nice to them, treat them well, and they will be awesome to you in return.  So in summary: Food, decent; Beer, decent; Moscow mules, delicious; Bartenders, awesome.

Color me unimpressed.  Anybody who knows me (and even some who don't) know that I love my beer. I consider myself a connoisseur, and have been called a beer snob on occasion (might have to do with my twitter handle.) With 54 taps and 500 bottles, this place certainly doesn't disappoint on the beer aspect. So why the 1 star, you might ask? With all of my high hopes for this place, it fell flat on its face in every aspect I feared it would. It was over crowded with far too little seating (we ended up standing). The music was loud enough that everybody had to practically shout and lean in towards each other to be heard. Then there was the service.  Only one other time have I ever even considered walking out on a tab. It takes a lot to get me to that point. Now while we were greeted quickly, which sounds like a rarity, this was the only good portion of the service. While my own beer arrived within only about 5 minutes, my friend's beer waited under the tap for a good 10 minutes, completely forgotten about. Of course this was only after he was told twice that the other beers he wanted were no longer available, with 5 minute gaps between each of these. At this point we decided to finish our beers and be done with this place. Little did we know, this was no easy task. Getting near the end of our beers, our server asked if we would like another round and we said, "No we'd like to tab out." Simple enough. 20 minutes later, still no check. I managed to get the attention of our server again finally and held my credit card out toward her this time, hoping for a stronger hint. "Oh, would you like to tab out?"  I am quite certain I will not be giving this place a second chance.
