I've been going to this place since it first opened over 20 years ago.  I still make it a point to get there for a shake every time I make it back home.  It's great for that and for chilling to the oldies.  I can't say I ever had any idea that the place would still be going strong, as I remember it was originally only a temporary setup, awaiting the inevitable displacement from the planned freeway down Colter (which never ended up materializing).  Imagine my shock when I drove past one in Las Vegas a few years ago.  Long live the 5 & Diner.

I grew up eating at this place, going back to the days when it was on the corner of 16th and Bethany in the spot where TexAz is today.  I would say that this place is very dependable.  The food is solid, and it's a steal.  I had a machaca burro enchilada style with an iced tea, and it set me back about $10.  It is a real Phoenix institution.

Huevos con masa.  That dish absolutely rocked.  The chiles, the cornbread, the queso sauce, now that was the way to start the day.  Great service, too.

We had breakfast there recently.  I had the iron skillet and it was such a cool dish.  Such a creative presentation, if nothing else.  Two years ago we had dinner there and I remember it really knocked our socks off, though I don't remember enough of that meal to provide details.  The view at this place is second to none, to say the least, whether on a clear day, at sunset, or at night.  As someone else already said, it is a nice crowd there, and the decor is very tastefully done.

This place never disappoints.  We started with fried squash blossoms that included red and yellow pepper sauces.  I had a cioppino with green chile sauce.  Wow, that was an amazing dish.  I usually shy away from cioppino because I'm not that big on tomato broth.  Green chile sauce makes it more than worthwhile.  My wife had a grilled chicken that had mango salsa and 12 spices (that's one more than you get at KFC).  Dessert was another great creation.  We split an order of the churros that came with a chocolate sauce that was flavored with star anise.  The waiter recommended it.  It often pays to listen to what dishes they recommend.  Another standout dish I had on a past visit was the pork tenderloin.  Absolutely amazing chile sauces with that one, also.  The strawberry shortcake that time was good, but not nearly as good as the churros.  Also, I have to give kudos to the service.  The staff was more than friendly throughout the evening.  This restaurant is a must, whether in Vegas or New York (though Vegas is much easier to get into than NYC).

Absolutely first rate service at this place.  Ribeye was solid, though not one that I am going to talk about for the next six months, and the sides were very good.  The malbec didn't go with the meal as well as I had hoped it would, but I forgot how hard that can be to pair with food.  I didn't realize the sides would be as salty as they were.  That meal needed something like a pinot noir.   My wife had the sea scallops and she absolutely loved them.  The staff recommended the monkey bread for dessert, and they sure were right on that one.  I paired it with a glass of madeira, and that was a homerun.  I got that one right, anyway.  I would give this place 4 1/2 stars if it let me.  I can't give it five, though.  It is a great dining experience.  Next time, I am going to splurge on that Kobe skirt steak.

This is the best place to have breakfast on the Strip, bar none.  We ate here three out of four days during our last trip there, and we only regret that we didn't eat there on the other day.  I had the signature french toast dish, the waffles with strawberries, and the croque madame.  It doesn't get any better.  And the cool thing is that it is a great value, especially when one compares it to an overpriced crappy casino coffee shop or any overcrowded buffet on the Strip.  Don't miss a trip to the bakery downstairs to get something for later.

Make sure to get a flatbread dish.  I had one with prosciutto and figs.  Wow.  I paired my meal with a Spanish mencia wine.  If you are ordering several dishes, split the pasta because it is way too much for one person.  I loved my butternut squash ravioli dish, but I had a lot left over.  Dessert was really cool.  It was a tea infused creme brulee with lemon scones.  A very Iron Chef interpretation of tea with scones, to say the least.

I tried this burger for the first time last night.  I took them up on the medium rare recommendation and was not disappointed.  The bun was very light and crisp and served to complement the burger, so the emphasis was properly placed on the burger itself.  The fries in the shopping cart were a nice creative touch.  They were solid aside from the presentation.    Allow for extra time to park, as the lot is incredibly crowded.

This was definitely a memorable meal.  I loved the veal parm so much that the wait staff thinks I might have set a record for fastest time to finish it.  I paired it with a barbera wine.  That was perfect.  Dessert was a chocolate and peanut butter creation that I still had room for.  It's not a cheap place to go, but worth eating at once during a trip to Vegas.

Definitely the meal of the week for us.  We started with a salad that had a bacon and cinnamon combination with spinach and goat cheese.  That was certainly a new one for us.  The short rib dish was outstanding.  I loved the way the spices went against the cola flavoring.  My wife had the pernil asado, and she enjoyed that.  It should also be noted that the sides were outstanding.  We closed the evening out with the chocolate cake with ancho chiles and ice cream that had little malted milk balls in it.  One of a kind dessert, that was.  Honestly, chocolate cake desserts are so commonplace, and it's easy to forget all the different ones we've tried, but this one will certainly be remembered.  Wines were not ridiculously marked up, either (and that is a huge pet peeve of mine).  We look forward to a return visit soon, as it's right by the ancestral abode.  I just wish it was around when I used to live in Phoenix.

One of the last of the independents in the Valley.  I think it's a real shame that Total Wine is gobbling up everything in sight out there, as chains like that take the fun out of the wine experience.  AZ Wine has a discount rack up front, and that is always fun to check out.  I lucked out with an older German pinot noir last time I was there that was marked down from $50ish to $20.  You don't get experiences like that at Total Wine.  AZ Wine tries to get a lot of lesser known producers (as much as a shop can do in a limited distribution market like Arizona, anyway).  Invariably, that's where the fun is when it comes to wine.  And I don't mean wines produced in Arizona that often aren't worth the money, either.  I have always enjoyed talking with their staff when I make it over there.  I find that they are all knowledgeable, helpful when asked, and never obnoxious.  AZ Wine Co is one of the last of the Mohicans.  Before you do your usual trip to Total Wine or BevMo, you owe it to yourself to visit an independent like this and get a more personal and interesting wine experience instead of the usual lowest common denominator experience you are sure to get at the chains.

I am glad I took the time to seek this place out.  If a local husband and wife shop can compete at a major intersection with numerous big players, it must be doing something right.  I came in to find a few gift bottles.  There were some well known bottles as well as a number of more obscure offerings.  I found a relatively well known Malbec (which I later saw was 50 cents more at nearby Total Wine), and they steered me towards a white Priorat that was 100% Grenache Blanc (or Garnacha Blanca if you prefer).  Who knew that existed?  If you want a more personal wine buying experience with owners who put a lot of thought into what goes on their shelves, and who don't do ridiculous markups, you should check this place out.  It's a lot more interesting shopping here than it is at a big impersonal chain or at that shop down the road that specializes in trophies that nobody can afford.

The thing I remember the most from this meal was the wine.  It was from a vineyard on the Italy-Slovenia border region.  The grape was ribolla gialla.  It was made the old fashioned way, in ceramic urns that were stored underground, and unfiltered.  It was orange in color, though it was classified as a white wine.  The entree was good, not great.  The nectarine salad was very solid, and the gelato dessert was fun.  One of the flavors was mocha porter.  Yes, it really worked.

Loved the fried chicken and waffle dish.  The spice and the maple syrup really worked well together.  My wife's chilaquiles dish was excellent, also, and she also enjoyed their signature iced coffee drink.  Nice vibe in this place, too.

I was shown this place back in the early 90s, and just ate here again for the first time in like twelve years.  Every single time, I've gotten the meatball and cheese sub.  Since I've moved to Chicago, I still have yet to find a place that made one like that.    The prices can't be beaten.  The old signed picture of Ronald and Nancy Reagan addressed to Raffaele himself is still on the wall, though the ink has worn considerably since I first saw it.  The ambiance is so everyman, and that really is how it should be, yet the place is a secret that every customer is in on.  It is all about the food.   The sandwich is still pretty much the same, but I think the bread was better back then.  It used to be a well baked bread, and if you grabbed the sandwich with both hands, a meatball would always fall out of it.  So I think the bread might be a bit different from then, but otherwise everything else is the same.  I was seriously stuffed after eating that sandwich, just like before.  I can't give an opinion on the pizza, because I've always had to have that sandwich, no matter what.

Considering what an average meal costs on the Strip, a burger, shake and fries combo for $19 is not so bad.  I don't think this meal would cost much less at the crappy casino coffee shop, anyway.  Go for a shake if nothing else.

I loved the peach creme brulee pancakes.  Every year that we come here, the pancakes always win.  It should be free if you can finish the meal, like if you can finish the massive steak at that steakhouse in the Texas panhandle.

I'm sorry, but this place is a total ripoff for lunch.  If not for people using their corporate Amex cards while being stranded on the island, this place would have no chance.  This cheeseburger and fries combo is not worth $15.  It just isn't.  And the service doesn't warrant the markup, either.

Total Wine is what is wrong with wine retail in Phoenix.  It represents the lowest common denominator, corporate wine, impersonal environment, weak product knowledge, and a soul sucking wine shopping experience.  If you want competitive pricing on Kendall Jackson or Cupcake, you just might get that here.  If you think there's more to wine than mass produced and mass distributed offerings, and corporate directed buying of uninspired wines, this store is probably not for you.  (It's not to say that every single wine on their shelves is terrible or uninspired, but good luck finding the few gems they have in this horrendous layout, and with the too frequent lackluster customer service.)

So I immediately went to the wine section, as I am wont to do in a place like this.  I arrive at a 2004 Pio Cesare Barbaresco.  I find the price tag.  $80!!!  I exclaim to myself, 'Jesus Christ!'  Immediately, the manager comes over and asks what am I saying "Jesus Christ" about, and I say, '$80 for a Barbaresco?'  And he launches into how he is merely charging 30% markup, and how it's a fair price for a Barbaresco of that vintage, especially for Pio Cesare.  I told him that I could get Barolos for less money than that, and that everything is cheaper now, implying that he should be aware of the market development.  (Edit:  I saw that this same bottle goes for $54 at Total Wine, by the way.)  I think this guy thinks it's still 2005 in Scottsdale, where any idiot with money to burn would pay the asking price, no questions asked.   I didn't even get into the outrageous markup on their half bottle of 20 year tawny.  What's the point?  I just walked out, disgusted with this place.  In this day and age, wine-searcher.com is the great equalizer for the consumer.  It has taken away the information asymmetry dynamic that was so pervasive in wine.  As more consumers catch on, places like Oakville will either have to lower prices or they will just have to quit selling wine.

I enjoyed my evening at the Vig Uptown.  Solid Persian Chicken kabob, with an unmentioned shirin polo accompaniment (they just call the accompaniment by the contents instead, probably for the sake of simplicity).  Kudos for offering good wine at a bargain price, also.  We had a bottle of their Spanish garnacha for only $21.  It went very well with my dish, and someone in my group who had the pork chop (which included a cherry/dijon reduction) loved that pairing, also.

This was definitely the best meal of this year's holiday trip....  The Kale Caesar! is a very creative interpretation of the timeless classic.  We loved the melted Scamorza cheese.    I had the Applewood Smoked Duck for my entree, accompanied by a glass of the Siduri pinot from Willamette.  The wine was perfect with the cherry sauce, besides the fact that pinot is a classic pairing with duck.  A glass of Siduri for $12 is a great deal, too.  I loved the way the duck was prepared, too, and it did not weigh me down afterwards like duck often can, either.  My wife had the buttermilk roasted chicken along with a glass of their creative (and delicious) interpretation of sangria.  Roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet corn are part of the presentation.    Dessert was the decadent Dream Pudding Jar.  We always get excited about an original dessert dish, and this one did not disappoint.  Service was top notch all the way, also.

This was our final meal of the trip.  My apple cinnamon French toast was one for the ages.  Very fluffy pieces of challah.  My wife had a scramble with bacon, spinach and Monterey Jack cheese, and even the toast that accompanied it was above and beyond what most places pass off as toast.  Aside from the meal being top grade, I would say that the service here should be a model for all breakfast/brunch places to follow.  This is a very popular place, apparently, and they make it look so effortless to get everyone served promptly.  We were told the wait was 10 minutes, and it was probably five or so.  There was very little wait for the food to come out, and a new iced tea was put in front of me well before I had finished the current glass.  They have a huge staff, and they are all working hard and keeping up with the deluge of customers.

This is my go to wine shop whenever I'm in Phoenix.  If you enjoy truly interesting Old World wines as much as I do, you need to shop here for wine.  The owner is very knowledgeable, and he goes all out to source bottles you aren't going to see much of around the Valley, if ever.

Slowly but surely, the the Total Wine/BevMo death grip on Phoenix is loosening.  Stores like this one are why that is so.  I owe this place a real visit next time I am in town.  Unfortunately I could only scout it out as I was staying nearby for a weekend wedding.  If you want to find interesting new wine experiences that you won't get at the retail boxes, and you want to learn more about the world of wine, this is a great place to go.  Downtown is the new Phoenix rising, and this store is a part of it.
