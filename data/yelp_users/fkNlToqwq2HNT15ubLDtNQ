Went here last night for my cousins birthday dinner. The atmosphere was cool, the live music was good and the slide they have inside the restaurant was fun for the kiddos. The food however...not so good. It's pretty pricy and on the chicken dish my sister got there was nothing but fat, and I tried one of my grandmother's BBQ ribs and there was barely any meat at all on those either. Definitely not worth the $20 a plate... Probably the only sweet thing about the food was the cotton candy they bring you at the end. Even the biscuits they serve you at the beginning were cold and crumbly. Then at the end the server was even allowed to split up the check! We had to figure it out ourselves. All I can say is I was not impressed...

Best ham breakfast burritos ever....and the cooks at this location specifically know how to make them right!!! Any other location you go to it's a hit or miss, but most of the time a miss. Oh and it's only like 4 bucks for the breakfast burrito! So you get your money's worth

Been going here since I was a kid, it's soooo delicious! I usually order the Ziti Alfredo pasta with added veggies, comes with a large size of freshly baked bread. Mmmm!! My boyfriend gets the lasagna and says it's "the best he's ever had" Oh and you HAVE to get the pazooki (large warm cookie pie with ice cream on top) at the end. My sisters and I use to fight over that thing, it's so dang gooood

My FAVORITE BBQ place in the state of Arizona!!! I order the pulled pork sandwich every single time with a side of homemade cheesy Mac and cheese with cheez-it crumbs sprinkled on top....it's to die for!!! OMG and for desert, their chocolate chip cookies are so warm and soft, it melts in your mouth....agh so good!!! The service is awesome too, everyone is very attentive and friendly! The food is served like a school cafeteria style, it's fun! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for GOOD food!! Just be sure to get there a little bit earlier than "dinner time" or "lunchtime" cause it gets busy!!! The line will be all the way out the door sometimes!

BY FAR... my favorite Mexican restaurant to eat at. My sisters and I absolutely LOVE the bean dip that is served with chips and salsa, and when I brought my boyfriend here for the first time, he asked if he could bring a tub of their salsa home because it was one of the best salsas he's ever tasted. I brought two of my other friends here just the other day and they ordered the House Quesidilla and said it was sooo delicious. But my all time favorites are the mini chimis (with a side of rice) and the Pollo Fundido. To keep it short sweet and to the point, anytime I'm craving good mexican food...I think La Casa Blanca!!

Haven't ever had a bad experience at a coffee shop before until this one, and I've been to many coffee shops. My friends and I are planning our trip to LA this weekend so we needed to meet up somewhere to book the hotel & etc but we all were working late so I thought hmm where's a place that's open late during the week? I thought Coffee Rush, it's open til 11pm, I've been here like twice before and it has a nice atmosphere outside. So I told the girls to meet there, some drove all the way from Glendale to meet up here.   Anyways so we sit down (there's 8 of us) at this point and in the first 5 min of being there a worker comes up to us and says "There needs to be a majority of your group with drinks. Theres 8 of you so at least 4." 3 of us had already bought a drink when they got there so we were like okay...I guess we'll go buy one more drink? It just seemed so silly.   So a few more girls in our group show up and now there's 12 of us total. We told the new girls to go and buy some drinks (they also had laptops with them and in order to use the wifi you have to buy a drink to get a code that can only be used on one device)   We go on with our night sitting outside in a corner just minding our own business not being loud or disrespectful to the people around us, and the owner/general manager whoever comes up to us and asks us if we had "called in before hand to ask for permission to have such a large party there" We're like uh no, we didn't know that was a rule? I mean who would?? And he was just completely rude and kept saying "yes you need to email us or call us telling us how many people you have and see if it's okay before coming in here with such a big group" (remember there was 12 of us, not really that big of a party, there was plenty of other open tables and chairs etc for other guests) So then he says he will let it slide this one time, and we're like okay whatever sorry we didn't know??  If all of that terribly customer service wasn't enough... There's a back gate to come in to the patio, and one of our friends ran out to their car to get something and came back in through the gate, and a worker yelled at us and said we have to make them go around through the front entrance!! How ridiculous!! She went out there for a second.  -Oh also if you want to purchase a drink on a debit or credit card & you're just buying one drink, it has to be the largest size because there's a certain dollar amount that is required to make a purchase on your card.   I have never took the time to write such a long review on yelp or anything before, but my experience here really pissed me off. Especially since I recommended this place to my friends and they had to make the drive out here. You can say that next time we will be going to a Starbucks or somewhere else of the sort that has better and more reasonable customer service!!

This place is soooo delicious!!! And fun because you get to put together your own bowl. Fill it up as high as you can but don't let it overflow because they will only cook what is on the bowl. Service is amazing at this location, especially Alex-he's awesome!! Very helpful and friendly :) I highly recommend this place, you really get your money's worth!!!

Tried this place out today and omg it's so yummy that I had to write a review!!! I ordered the chicken gyro combo that came with fries and a drink for $8.50 after tax. I asked the owner what a certain dessert was that was sitting in the pan on the counter and he gave me a piece for free! Very friendly workers. Now back to the food...let's just say, I got it to go and when I got home I was barely able to eat it because my family devoured it!!! I took one bite and was moaning because it was so delicious, and my sisters and parents came into the kitchen to check out what I was eating and asked to try it... Then they just kept taking more and more of my food cause it was sooo good! Now they owe me. Lol so the fries are seasoned to perfection, the chicken is marinated and juicy topped with fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and tahini sauce on a pita....nom nom I'm getting hungry just talking about it!!!

Ugh probably my new favorite breakfast place!!! So glad I found this gem, because I'm not typically a breakfast person. My favorite thing that my boyfriend introduced me to-- the PROTEIN PANCAKES. Whole wheat pancake batter mixed with blueberries, granola, almonds, & cinnamon. Not only are they delicious but good for you too! It's a win win. If you just want pancakes you can order that but beware of your portions cause just the pancakes alone are the size of a large plate! & it comes with two. Or you can do what I had this morning which was the "Half & Half". Comes with two small protein pancakes, and a half order choice of one of their Idaho Skillets. I got the Santa Fe Skillet, which comes with hash browns, eggs, cheese, chicken, chorizo, tomatoes, and a green chile sauce on top. Very flavorful. All for $11 bucks. Couldn't even finish it! Which is okay cause now I'll have leftovers for tomorrow :) One more cool thing that's kind of different, whatever drink you order they bring a pitcher and leave it at your table so that you don't have to wait for the waiter to bring you more drink! Love it. PEOPLE GO HERE!   :)

I got food poisoning from this place last night. Not only that but the chicken tasted soggy and stale, should of known not to eat it in the first place, that's how their food usually turns out unless you ask for a fresh batch. But now that I've actually gotten sick from the food, yuck!! NEVER EATING AT PANDA AGAIN

5 stars hands down. Could probably be the best nail salon in Arizona! This is the first place that I've found that has nail technicians that actually speak English well, so it's easy to communicate with them and tell them exactly what you want. Everyone here is super friendly too, esp Lin! She's my new go-to girl because she does an amazing job, and just an overall great person to have a conversation with! The salon is clean and professional, and offers many colors for paint! I get the gel manicure every time and they last me for weeks!!! No chipping. And If they do chip or if you are not satisfied with your nails, you can go back and they will fix them for you free of charge! The designs they can make are beautiful and artsy--I'm always getting compliments on my nails!  Show them a picture and they can re create it, they're extremely talented. Basically...Greenfield Nails is my favorite nail salon!! I recommend it to anyone :)

Let me tell you, I've heard some good things about this place but my first experience and probably last experience was not what I had expected!! First off, I couldn't even finish my overpriced burger because it was making my stomach turn. The terrible shoe-stringed fries didn't help either. Oh yeah and the iced tea tasted very watered down and gross. The bathrooms were not cleaned whatsoever, there was toilet paper and paper towels all over the place, and the toilet seat top itself wasn't even on.   Bottom line....take my advice and go to IN N OUT burger instead. Better food, happier wallet.

Just so everyone knows, this store has opened up under a new owner located in Dana Park, in Mesa Arizona! Off of Baseline & Val Vista. The store is in between Anthropology & Z Gallery! Still great prices & beautiful clothing, accessories & home goods for all ages!  go check it out!

Another one of my favorite places, especially this location!!! It's right along the lake, so I definitely recommend sitting outside before AZ's summer heat catches up with us! The food is always delicious, and the service is excellent! They come and check on you frequently and your food comes out pretty quickly. For hummus, my recently new favorite is the Jalapeno-Cilantro (not spicy). For entrees I recommend the Chicken Pasta Salad, the Ginger stir fry, or the Broiled Chicken Pita. Honestly though I haven't had anything here that wasn't good.

My friend just ordered a sandwich from here and the bottom her bread has mold on it. How disgusting. It should deserve 0 stars but it wouldn't allow me to. This mall is really going down hill into the dumps

Went here last Sunday for the first time based on the Yelp reviews. I will say that this will probably be our new go-to breakfast place every Sunday with the family. The service was great, we were seated within 20 minutes on a busy Sunday morning. Mike was our server and he was absolutely wonderful. Very charming! He checked on us often & made us laugh with good conversation. :) Now on to the food.... Soooo good!!! We ordered a short stack of pancakes that between the three of us it didn't even look like we put a dent into it (they are massive- and for $8 bucks that's a steal!) I also had to get a homemade cinnamon roll because they are my favorite & I read that they sell out pretty quickly! You could tell it was homemade because the frosting was very sweet, it was more of a decadent dessert type cinnamon roll but nonetheless, very good! My mom ordered the chorizo biscuits and gravy, also something I recommend! Overall it was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely be back soon!
