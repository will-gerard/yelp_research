Had dinner here for the first time and we will definitely be back.  Our server Seth was the best I've had in a while. He knew everything about the menu and made great recommendations. I'm surprised we hadn't heard more about this place before. The crab cakes are fantastic, as were our drinks. Very enjoyable dinner!

Most things here were just ok for the price but biggest complaint are the quality of drinks served at the pool... My boyfriend and I had a pina colada and a strawberry daiquiri and we were both sick to our stomachs within half an hour and had to leave. Ruined the day. DO NOT order the frozen drinks...

Love this place! Close to home but my real selling point is the dog friendly patio and homemade dog biscuits they bring out for the pups. Food is great, as is the service every time.
