I absolutely love this regional park! The only pitfall is the cost of admission.....Seems to me that a park should be free to enter but I understand that there are costs for maintenance as well. Buying an annual park pass makes the most sense if you plan on making repeat visits. Beautiful views of the valley from any trail. All levels of intensity for hiking, biking and the like. Hard to believe the mountain is surrounded by houses because it seems so serene when visiting.

Great group of professionals! I would recommend them to anyone. The best part is being able to watch a movie while you're bein worked on :)

Love, love, love the decor of this place! It's so pristine and modern. I see Kimberly Fry for my services and she is AMAZING. She always takes her time and gives you exactly what you are looking for.  She is genuine and kind and really knows her stuff! If you are looking for a waxer, I highly recommend her, and have never been unsatisfied with my results.   The staff is also quite professional and friendly. They always call to remind me of my appointments a day prior which is huge for someone like me who always forgets to write it down.   Make an appointment, you won't be sorry!

I have always had great service and who doesn't love a spa pedicure complete with sugar scrub and hot stone massage? All for $20 too! You can also find coupons in the Surprise weekly paper that's delivered every Wednesday to get the pedicure for $16.99. Can't beat that!

Crust was overcooked and only mediocre flavor. Won't eat again
