Asadero Toro may not be much to look at (outside or in), but they serve high quality Mexican food. The menu may look a bit daunting to a gringo, but the employees have always been very nice and helpful when I had a question. The setup is casual with a small salsa bar that contains sliced cucumbers, shredded lettuce, lime halves and pickled onion slices. For liquid refreshment, you can get a cold bottle of super sweet Mexican Coke or even Mexican 7-Up (that's something you don't see every day).  Condiments and drinks aside, the main reason to come here is -- the meat! Tacos are nice, but I usually pick one of their huge burritos with lots of savory beef stuffed in a huge, fresh tortilla. The carne asada is wonderful, as is the birria de chivo (a goat stew). Their meat tastes as if it's been stewing in juices all day, making me wonder if they leave it bubbling in a huge vat overnight.   One thing I like about Asodero Toro is that they have items that use the, ahem, offbeat parts of the cow. Recently I tried the beef tongue burrito, which was great. Perhaps one day, when I feel REALLY brave, I will try that cow's head burrito.

I echo the other reviews - great place with a small but well-chosen selection. The guy (Doug) who runs it is very friendly and knowledgeable about midcentury modern decor.   Unfortunately, this location will be closing soon. I'm hoping he opens another local shop sometime soon, since it was great having this little slice of Palm Springs retro sophistication in Central Phoenix.

Thank ye gods that I have a donut shop within walking distance of my house. This is a good one, too, despite the scrappy exterior. Honestly, the dining area is dingy and the coffee is nothing to write home about. Buy a dozen to go from the cheery donut lady (her name is Mary, by the way) and take confidence that everything is good and well worth the price. The gigantic cinnamon rolls and fritters that usually sell out early are to die for, but I've also enjoyed the sugar-dusted raised twists and perfect cake donuts covered in icing with peanuts, coconut or the ever popular chocolate sprinkles. It kind of blows my mind that more of my neighbors prefer the dry, unexceptional pastries at Starbucks or the sickly sweet, undersized product that Dunkin' Donuts churns out. Let 'em be a flock of ignorant sheep, I say. I'll keep patronizing my funky little neighborhood donut joint until either they run out of sprinkles or I stop seeing my toes - whichever comes first.

This looks like a nice little thrift store with a great selection of clothing. Nice front door, nice sign, nice paint trim on the windows ... I hate to dwell on irrelevant stuff like that, but let me explain. My partner and I arrived here at the posted opening time of 11:00 on a Saturday. Both of us are avid thrifters and wanted to check it out. We waited out front for 25 minutes (other potential customers came by, too), got a load of the traffic buzzing by on Indian School, and saw no sign of any employees inside or out. I still have yet to see the inside of this place. Cool concept, but three snaps down for failing to open on time!!

I was kind of dubious about this place, being a "-berto's" joint and all, but it's pretty terrific grub. The service is great and they keep the dining area squeaky clean with a widescreen TV tuned into a Mexican news station. They also have free wi-fi, which I haven't yet tried. I swung by there today and had the carne asada torte. This is a huge sandwich (about 9"x6") with a swatch of thinly sliced beef, lettuce, tomato and guacamole, served on a yummy homemade roll. It's served with french fries, a heckuva deal for $3.99. I've also had their burrito plate, easily big enough for two meals. Delicious, affordable, filling, what more can one ask for. At the very least, you can sit in this repurposed Burger King and dig the circa 1991 decor.

Out of all the eateries settling in on the "Corner on 7th" complex at McDowell and 7th Avenue, I was most excited for the Zoyo Yogurt. This locally owned chain serves up some high-quality soft serve along with a nice array of toppings - for a great price, too. We've been by several times and have never been disappointed (except when the one sugar-free option is something like mint or coffee - ick).  What I like to do is take one of the smaller cups and fill the bottom with a layer of the sweeter flavors like graham cracker or toffee topped with something like crushed Butterfingers. Then I put a fruity flavor (peach rocks) or good 'ol vanilla on the upper half with a fresh fruit topper. Yum.
