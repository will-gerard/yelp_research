Ask for Jamie!! She did such an amazing job on my hair. She was so knowledgeable and gave me some great tips to improve the quality of my hair. I love my hair cut and how quickly she got me in and out!

Came in for a quick bite before the music at Kierland. If we didn't chose to eat outside the not so busy place was on a 45 min wait?!?! Whatever outside wasn't that bad with misters. The Dr. Pepper I ordered my 4 year old came out a diet coke. Even he knew the difference and refused to drink it so I asked for a Chocolate Milk instead. Then we were charged for the Dr.Pepper we NEVER got and a kids drink was supposed to come with his meal! He got the Crispy Chicken which was a lot of food and good. Not your typical kids chicken fingers. Unfortunately my 4 year old doesn't like rosemary so he would barely eat it. The fries were large and saturated with grease. Our Pitcher of Sangria was so full of ice it would have been cheaper to order it by the glass! When we went to fill our cups back up the second time the ice was overflowing out of the small glass onto the table and the tiny amount of liquid was left at the bottom. No bread was brought to start we had to ask for it while we ate because the bread they supply to soak up the juice of the mussels was hard like a crouton. The Mussels were alright but tasted like bitter burnt garlic (in fact we found large amounts of burnt garlic in it). We ended up leaving after our appetizer since the service and food was so bad.

My son went there for years and never learned to swim. Think about it if your kid is swimming you don't need classes anymore. With 3 -4 kids in a 30 min class your kid only gets about 7 mins at most with the instructor so you do the math. In one hour at home I taught my son how to swim and I have no training. We kicked ourselves for the amount of money, time and effort we would of saved just doing it ourselves. I would even reccomend finding a real instructor to have a private 1 on 1 lesson. Also I heard at around 4- 5 kids learn to swim quickly so doing classes at 6 months to 3 years was a waste of money. I know people who had great success with survival swimming at 2-3 which is great if you have a pool and need them to learn to float and get to the side of the pool and lift themselves out. Aqua tots doesn't teach kids these techniques to really keep them safe and by 5 years old my son could have still easily drowned.

We love this church~! The band is beyond AMAZING! The message is always uplifting and can easily be understood and applied to everyday life.  My son is almost 4 and looks forward to going every Sunday. He even asks if we can go there when its not Sunday! We were happy at a church before but decided to visit because my brother goes there. Needless to say we never looked back and are HOOKED! Been every week since!  Can't say enough nice things about this place and am SUPER excited for its future!

I live right next to this location and there is never anyone there. Growing up in CA we drove far to get to one and there was ALWAYS a 30 min wait. My son gets a donut after school and they are always hard and stale. Not sure why I have never had a hot donut but probably why this location sucks and I refuse to pay 1.50 for an old donut with hard frosting!!
