I love this restaurant! I feel like this is what Indian dining should be like. The setting and the service are great. And the food!! I feel like this is the best I've come across in Arizona. It might be a little more than other Indian restaurants but I think it's worth it. The food is delicious and I would recommend this place to anyone.

I loved this place. I haven't come across a store that sells more local (a lot of which are organic) items in one place. It's great. Just what I was looking for!! I got some organic teas and vegan/vegetarian tamales. Very excited to try! I wish the produce was a little better, but they have some stuff. Hopefully it will just get better.

It might be a good "deal", but the quality of this food is very low. The chicken tikka masala was difficult to eat. The pieces of chicken were gross and not cleaned at all. A lot of veins, fat, and unwanted pieces. The place also could stand to be cleaner. I don't think I will be back.

Deyna is officially my favorite wax person I've come across so far. She was so nice and really knew her stuff. My wax came out perfectly and I really like her style. Best underarm and leg waxing :) I will definitely be coming back again and would recommend her to anyone and everyone!

We had a perfect evening here. The atmosphere, food, and wine were great. I will be coming back here again and bring more people with me.

Today is the second time I've come to this place because I have been craving it ever since. I recently became vegetarian and this place has become my favorite restaurant. The food is delicious and beautiful and the ingredients are all local, which I love, and mostly organic I believe. Don't forget to also try the dessert!! I definitely recommend this place and will continue to support it. So good! :)

This place was amazing. I've been transitioning into a vegetarian lifestyle and this place is god sent. It was so delicious. There were so many choices. Who needs meat?? It was clean and the service was wonderful. I will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone.

I need to show this place some love because they deserve it! I absolutely loved this place and have been craving it ever since. I had the lamb soup with hand pulled noodles which was effing amazing. That has to be the best broth I've ever had from an Asian restaurant!!! The noodles were great as well. We also had the orange chicken which was the best I've ever had! So crispy and not too much sauce. I will definitely be coming back for more. Probably today. Lol
