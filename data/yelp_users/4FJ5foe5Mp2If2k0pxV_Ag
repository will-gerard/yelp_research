I've had both Japanese vehicles in here for oil changes. The folks here are very thorough with checking filters, refilling fluids, tire rotation. David is very knowledgable about oil types and recommendations.  Call beforehand to set up an appointment or you'll be in line for a long while!

Got my food real fast (Express, I guess). Curry rice was over-spiced, not tasty at all.

Nice music, lighting. Indoors and outdoors seating. Waiters stood around like secret service agents. Food had slight char, but otherwise delicious. Would recommend my friends.

The place is decked out in Italian decor. The staff is super friendly! The food was delicious!  Friday night was not busy at all! We had the gnocchi plate and the butternut squash ravioli. The gnocchi was good, but the ravioli was DELICIOUS.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Go light on the garlic knots, make room for the Margherita Pizza, save space for the Cannolis.  I hear the place is owned by two guys from New York. I've never been to NYC, but the pies they make here are phenomenal.  The customer service is impeccable - Tony manages the front and personally greets the customers - he came by our table and we shared laughs and had a great time!  The pizzas are very large, the portions are very generous. At the end, we were given a free small order of cannolis.  One of the friendliest places I have EVER been to. If only all restaurants and businesses were run like this place!!

Party of four, we ordered 4 burgers, all varying levels of Medium. Order came back all well done.  For what it's worth, management redid the burgers and gave us half off the check.  This review does not reflect condition of dessert menu.

Their soy sauce had a smokey flavor. Affected the taste of standard rolls.  Las Vegas roll - tasted a little like bologna, prolly because of the soy. Spicy Salmon roll - spicy and delicious Sexy Girl roll - crab meat, sweet mayo, and a slice of strawberry. Mellow, fruity, almost like a dessert.  The staff were polite, helpful.

Tasty Mexican food! Very prompt and polite service! Colorful decorations, from the tables to chairs to the ceiling! Currently they are having El Trio de Jesse Armenta playing every Saturday night between 6 and 8 pm! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

Bootlegger burger is maybe the greatest burger I've ever had.  The Jack Daniels brownie had an excellent amount of cocoa in the brownie, topped with amazing ice cream.  The waiter (owner?) was extremely jovial and pleasant.  Would send anyone here.
