As good as it gets as far as diners go.  I'm not usually considered to be a hipster, but it might rub off on me if I spent more time her.  Great crowd hanging out eating delicious food.  Tiny enough that you HAVE to talk to the staff, they're right next to you.  Unless you sit outside.  That might be fun, too.  I've never actually been to a diner that had a liquor license, so have a hurricane with your brunch.

We come here fairly frequently.  This was not their best night.  The margarita I usually enjoy was limp and watery. The service was slow. The server was too busy to pay more than perfunctory attention to his customers. The food had  rushed air to it. Stay away from Saturday night.

Consistently good food and excellent, fast service.  I confused the staff by asking to change how something on the menu is normally presented and it didn't matter.  They made it how I wanted it.  Music selection leaves a bit to be desired.

Apparently, Barro ' s has decided that their gluten free offering is ok with a pre - made crust.   I can say that it's NOT.    It tastes like cardboard.

Super knowledgeable, convenient, friendly, Chris seems to know and love everything bicycle. I had a bike that supposedly had been set up and gone over by a shop in town, and the first time I rode it, the brakes felt off and the chain jumped off the sprocket when I shifted. In half an hour Chris was able to basically finish the assembly the shop had done so poorly, and get everything working and feeling the way it should. And he found ways to speak well of my cruiser bike!

Friendly? Yes. Fast? Never. Billing is always messed up. Drugs are never ready when promised.  So frustrating to deal with. I would much rather deal with the other compounding pharmacy that doesn't make me waste so much of my time.

Quirky, huge, all suite complex, no casino, and I was fine with that. Very tired buildings and decor  (some patches and repairs make you go, hmm?) the rooms are spacious and have the basics.  I was treated very well by the staff, even through a misunderstanding at checkin.  Its location is convenient except for the airplane noise. The property is not far north off the runway at McCarran, so during the day the noise is constant. During the nite, the planes are more occasional, but it is around the clock.  Checked in on a weekend day and was handed a voucher for breakfast as if it would be of use, but the vouchers are only good Mon-Thurs.

First time I ever visited and I might be addicted.  Super friendly helpful staff, super accessible way to wash a very hairy dog. Very affordable.  I'm used to doing this at home, I have a high power blow dryer and a big tub. I may never use either again.

I have been going to this place practically since it opened.  Was very intentional about continuing to go during light rail construction because it was important to me that they survive the construction and thrive as a business.  However, its' been a few months since I've gone downtown and so I haven't been in.  They've remodeled, I'm not crazy about the new seating they've chosen, but that's not really that big of a deal.  There were two people behind the counter, they were both standing there when I ordered a salad in a particular way because I have food related health issues. First, they took half an hour to make the salad (it was NOT busy in there!!), both of them delivered it, and the salad was made in the exactly the way that I had said not to do.   I pointed that fact out, one of them said, ok, we can just take that off of there, and I said no, you can't, you have to start over. One of them brought it back to me and there was clear evidence that I'd been ignored. The second time. No apology, no following directions, completely ignored me when I suggested that when people ask for things in a specific way, it's usually for a pretty important reason.   Sheesh, it's not McDonalds, they make stuff to order, they should be that much about customer service that she started over and didn't try to sneak something past me that is really important that I not eat.  I won't be going back.  This makes me sad.

I was told by a wine vendor in one of the other Fry's stores that this is the only "Signature" market in Arizona.  That is actually not true, there is one in Anthem that I'm aware of, so maybe there are others as well.    No matter, it is unique.  No shopping experience matches it.  I drive to it from a ways away when there is serious shopping to be done.  If all you want to do is dash in and grab a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread, the corner grocery store is better for that.  THIS store is an excursion.  It would be even if all you did was wander the aisles and admire the broad selection of items available in every category!  My family has health issues requiring particular types of foods that can be challenging to find in other neighborhood stores.  This Fry's has an amazing array of choices.  I also appreciate the selection of loose leaf teas and the ones I have tried are very good.  EVERY grocery store (almost) has whole bean coffee any more, I've never been in another one that carries quality loose leaf tea!  Cooking classes?  yeah, they've got that. plus all the other specialty items mentioned in other reviews.  I've even met someone here for a business meeting because of the plush coffee shop environment.  I know that free wi fi isn't much of a novelty any more, but it's nice to have for that meeting.  I've never encountered any grumpy employees, every staff person has been friendly and helpful.

In the category of services, check out their training classes.  Expertly taught, small classes at very affordable prices (you could even kick in a few extra bucks to support their important work in the community).  Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, CGC, Leash Manners, puppy classes, something for everyone.  Trainers have extensive backgrounds in dog behavior, creative problem solving on the fly!

Friendly, kitschy atmosphere (apparently folk LIKE to sit in the car to eat.  I do too much of that already!  :) ).  Animals hanging on the wall.  Food was great, salad was HUGE and very fresh and tasty.

Who knew that there could be a line before the place opens? Clearly this type of clinic fills a need in the community!   Friendly, caring staff, the perfect sized operation for those things in life that need medical attention but don't warrant a visit to the ER or that should wait for days or more to get into a primary care doc.

I like the food, and especially that they do lettuce wraps of anything on the menu.  This particular store, tho, just as I was leaving, a worker on the phone right next to the rack of sandwich rolls was sneezing multiple times making no attempt whatsoever to contain his sneezes. Gross.

This is a fave stopping off place for lunch.  I've always enjoyed the food, the staff have always been very friendly and helpful.  Until today.  Colleague and I dropped in for lunch and she placed her order ahead of me.  She was asked if she wanted to donate to X charity and she responded "No."  That should have been the end of it, but the server (#102, wasn't able to get her name) replied, "Don't care for charities, eh?"  It just so happens that Colleague commits about 60 hours per week to a charity and was there on a short break from some of those 60 very intense hours this week.  A.  It's no one's business why anyone declines to donate to any particular charity. B.  If someone says "No." DROP IT, cashiers should never go beyond that.  I'm seriously disappointed to see that another person had a similar experience at this store a couple of days ago. C.  Managers need to train their employees as to A. and B. above.  I don't care how good the food is, if it hadn't been for D. below, I would never go back. D.  We spoke to the manager and told her what had happened (wow, how cool is it that a store like this has a young, female manager!?!!?) and she was mortified.  She apologized profusely and appeared to approach said employee to address it immediately.

The single most horrid dining experience ever. Construction during breakfast?  Are you kidding me?!?  For years this place has been a "satellite office" where you could meet people, have a simple but good quality breakfast,  wait staff were amazing, all at a locally owned business that's been a staple in the neighborhood as long as I've lived in Moon Valley,  over 20 years.   Most wait staff we've come to know have left, the food is decidedly not as good, and now this: a breakfast meeting attempting an involved conversation punctuated by concrete being drilled directly adjacent to my table.   I'm not a business owner,  so maybe I'm misguided, but I would think that if you have a business that makes its mission to serve breakfast and lunch, and you need to have heavy construction done, you might have the contractor do the loud stuff when you're closed?

Tripped over this place. Lovely patio, delightful service.  Happy Hour deals make sampling affordable and delicious.  Wines on happy hour are tasty and affordable.  Tried both Malbecs, each had its own character

Family owned and run local business with world class tennis instruction and programming.  Small, well kept secret tucked up against the North Mountain preserve, the atmosphere is always friendly and relaxed.  But don't let the warm greetings and friendly staff fool you, the tennis is very competitive for those who want that. Lots of well-ranked USTA players hang out here!  Programming is available for all ages, including top flight instruction and coaching for juniors training for tournament play.  There is also a small weight room that features a circuit machine as well as elliptical and treadmill.  Some of the neighborhood families have "swim only" memberships to take advantage of the pool.  If you're serious about tennis, this is the place!

Don't get anything with rice in it today.  The rice isn't cooked. I've been to this place a lot and this has never happened before but it's yukky.  I'm sad to see the move to Styrofoam packages.

Sigh.  Two disappointing visits in a row.  Today the food was not prepared according to the order.  I might have to give up on this one altogether.

First time here. Good, fresh food,  friendly service. Two reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars:  rice is undercooked and nobody asked about our experience after we sat down so I could tell someone the rice is undercooked.  It probably wouldn't be a consideration if we hadn't been asked if it was our first time when we stepped up to order. Also, we were literally the only patrons in the place. You'd think someone would have had a moment to stop by our table to follow up.   My concern with the concept of having all the ingredients on display is for wheel chair users - are they able to see what I can see? Otherwise the facility is accessible.
