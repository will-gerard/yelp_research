This might just be my favorite place in all of Arizona. The meat is so ridiculously tender. Plus you get all of the toppings you want! Just a heads up, you pay after you eat! This is the way authentic Mexican restaurants work. They trust you, so trust them. It's great!

Literally the worst. I promise you it's not worth the discounted rates they quote. They are the opposite of Flow from Progressive. I was shocked when I stepped on the plane and they didn't start charging for oxygen. Plus, I think they have about 3 planes. There was one plane stuck in Texas so they couldn't get us home for three days and wouldn't pay for a room. Luckily they refunded the money and we drove a rental home.
