Their bread is baked fresh daily!! YUM! Their sandwiches are huge, so I'm glad they serve halves. The tuna melt on Rye (with Swiss substitued for cheddar) is amazing and delicious! Very small place, but definitely worth it. They are super friendly too!

I have gone here a few times in the last few years. I remember one time, ordering the sliders... DISGUSTING!!! It tasted like rotten meat... or as if the meat had fallen on the ground and put back on the buns. GROSS. It was game day, so it took forever getting the food, so we never complained or asked for another order since we had been starving. I ate the fries ONLY. Then, another time I visited, we asked for Pizza Rolls (thinking maybe they're as good as Casey Jones'). Nope... they were friggin Totino's pizza rolls, probably like $4 for a box of them at the grocery store, but $6.95 here. The next time I went, I didn't order food, I knew better! Don't have much to say about drinks, since I had nothing but water. Even that doesn't taste great though, like tap water. Great atmosphere for games, but just atrocious food.

Love their decaf!! I recently switched from regular to decaf and have been hesitant everywhere I go, ordering it. But Coffee Bean probably has some of the best in town! I get a light-iced, half hazelnut, half dark chocolate, almond milk latte. It's DELICIOUS! And they are always friendly too :)

Yum, yum & yum!!! I am a coffee enthusiast, and usually seek delicious coffee from local, tucked away, places. I'm always up for trying something new, b/c you never know what you could be missing out on. This place is only a little more than a 5 minute drive from me, and I'm so thankful I tried it this morning! I got there before 8am, and lucky for me it wasn't busy. The staff was super friendly and helpful. After looking over the menu, I decided on an Orange Sunset (Mocha w/a shot of Orange syrup). DELISH!! You know those Orange shaped chocolates you can get from World Market in the blue box? Yeah... just imagine that in your cup of coffee! Definitely going back to try it with raspberry next time (it was recommended, but I wanted to try the orange first, and glad I did!) :))

So since April, I have visited this place numerous times. I have had a breakfast sandwich and a delicious spicy turkey sandwich (minus onions & mayo) for lunch. I am usually not a scone fan either, since they are normally pretty dry, but after trying one of theirs (blackberry or raspberry perhaps??) I have changed my opinion of them!! It was SOOO good! More moist than others, and this delicious vanilla-sort-of taste to it as well. They even taste good a couple days old ;) Their staff has been so sincere and friendly since the get go! Definitely one of my favorite places. A lot of positive energy coming out of here :))

So even though I ADORE this place (and most of the time the music too... Thanks to them I listen to Carbon Based Lifeforms on a normal basis), but my experience today was less than mediocre. Whenever I deal with Sarah, Josh, or Roxy, my experiences have been great. They get it right and if not, they don't make me feel like crud. Yesterday I ordered a regular soy Orange Sunset, iced but no ice, and Josh made it in a small cup filled to the rim.   Today I ordered the same thing, and I make sure to be extremely clear about what I need, and whoever made my coffee today (young kid w/glasses whose name I'm unfamiliar with), seemed to not like that I asked him to take the ice out of my cup when he was done.   Then he proceeded to teach me how I am supposed to order it (cold, no ice). Either way, I said NO ICE. He gave it to me in a cup that was bigger than the one I drank yesterday and also informed me he can't fill it all the way up unless I pay for extra milk. Then, I taste it and realize this is NOT soy milk. Luckily I don't have an allergy to cow's milk, so I waited by the bar to ask if it was soy to make sure. He was taking orders from other customers that were behind me at the time, already, and the girl next to me asked him for me since she was able to get his attention. He said no, it wasn't, and I politely asked him if I could please have it with soy as I cannot drink regular milk. He seemed very irritated with me, and I was really disappointed the situation was handled so poorly and I was made to feel as though him getting my order wrong was somehow MY fault. I don't like that feeling at all. This is the 2nd time this has happened with this particular barista. A simple "I'm so sorry. Let me make you another one" would have sufficed just fine.   The coffee was great as usual the 2nd time around, and their Chocolate Chip Banana muffin is delicious too! Just make sure you are extra clear with certain people when you ordered. I should have asked a couple more times as follow up to be sure my order was made correctly, but I don't like assuming people don't get it right the first time... I assume though that they would ask me if they aren't sure.

I love their coffee and the staff is amazing. Hands down my favorite place!!  I always get the Orange Sunset, cold no ice with almond milk and it's delicious.  Their pastries and food are great as well. A must try for anyone who hasn't been!

I absolutely love this place. Being from NYC it's hard to find authentic and fresh Chinese food and this is the best I've had. I love their Kung Pao chicken (it's not fatty like those other places! Or fried either) and their General Tao. And when you say extra spicy, holy spice watch out! Delicious food and it's always consistent. Highly recommended!!

FYI, I'm trying to broaden my flavor horizons and order food I usual wouldn't, and I must say, the Panang Noodles (extra spicy) are delicious! The Tom Yum Noodles are great as well. The Hawaiian Fried Rice is a fave for me too.  I'm honestly never disappointed with this place (there was actually only 1 time when they were out of crab rangoons, I opted for the fried won tons instead and was disappointed at the tiny amount of meat in there). Other than that one-off time, I really love this place. Their delivery time is pretty accurate as well.  P. S. They state no MSG on their menu, and indeed I have not found there to be any! Sooooo relieving. I'd have a horrible headache if there was any hint of it. So eat easy folks! ;)

I've been coming here nearly every weekend (sometimes twice a weekend) for the last 6 months and LOVE it. They are extremely friendly and their food and coffee is delicious!! I usually get the Croissant breakfast sandwich without meat and with some extra veggies instead. I sub with Havarti cheese too :) To drink I get the Green Mint Latte with 1/2 soy 1/2 rice milk. Yummy stuff!!

So every weekend I come here and every weekend I'm never disappointed. The staff is great and the quality of food and coffee is superb. I love my weekends and always look forward to coming here! Their holiday drinks are delicious (I've tried the snickerdoodle & gingerbread chai lattes) but usually I go for green mint latte, all with almond milk. Their crepes and breakfast sandwiches are scrumptious as well!! If I could rate them more stars I would. I love this place!

Definitely a gem of a place, any Nutella fan would love their Mocha with Nutella (the iced is just as amazing as it is hot). I've eaten the Early Bird sandwich twice for breakfast and enjoy it (it's a great portion size). My friends and I ate on the patio and it's awesome for people who like to bring their dogs! A neighborhood friendly place, and it's one of my favorites. I like their bruschetta for dinner too... and of course the Nutella Marscapone Cheesecake for dessert... Mmmm. Their staff is super busy on Saturday mornings, and can get busy during dinner times too, but they are friendly and nice.

Updated 7.02: 5 stars!! Love this place for breakfast or dinner. Lovely and lively staff and the best decaf. Try their Nutella mocha (iced) with almond milk and their house-made orange syrup! So good!!!! Their bruschetta, sliders and drink options are great as well ;)

2 stars for being stingy with a Groupon. Server was good. Here's the scoop:  Last week I met about 30 other people there for a colleagues' farewell. We all sat at 5 different tables in an area across from the bar. When it came time to pay, the server told me (per her manager who never showed their face) that she couldn't accept my Groupon because someone else (within our group, not my table) had used one. ($10 for $20). Last time I checked, the fine print said LIMIT ONE PER TABLE. NOT one per group. (I read the fine print prior to buying!) I didn't want to argue about it in front of others so I sent a complaint days ago (online form) and have not yet heard back. Groupon however responded in less than 24 hours. I paid twice as much as I should have since I bought the Groupon, couldn't use it and paid full for my meal & drinks. STINGY. Needless to say unless the business offers me a resolution and compensation for their mistake in denying me the ability to use my Groupon, I, along with many others who experienced the same bullshit that day, will not be back. There are other locations that have more pleasant management. If you don't want to rightfully accept Groupons with the terms that were made for the establishment, then don't offer them. You can't make the rules up as you go! Put them in writing or let me use my damn Groupon.

Jay (the owner) just sent me lovely email offering to compensate with a gift card for all 4 people that could not use their Groupon due to the misunderstanding. Now THIS is great customer service. Thank you!! I received the coupon a few days later. Two thumbs up.

I ordered a to-go pizza last night for the first time after catching some good reviews about this place (it was Lucky's the last time I was at this location many years ago!) and I do not regret my decision at all!! They were totally great about my order (I asked them to take longer since I had guests coming over and I wanted the pizza to stay warm) and the pizza was delicious! I ordered a cheese with half pineapple and light on the sauce. That's what I got!! The only reason I hadn't given this 5 stars was because I really was hoping the slices would be a tad larger. I'm from Queens so I'm so used to the large slices you can fold and eat. Other than that, this place rocked and I WILL be back! Looked very nice and classy on the inside too :)

Went in on Sunday during a special they were running for $1 off "The Jam" (peanut butter, banana, Nutella, espresso) milkshake (I ordered mine made with almond milk) for #CoffeeMilkshakeDay. 3 words... TO DIE FOR; sooooo good!!! I missed seeing John (a friend who used to be of the of the best baristas at Matador Coffee), but I'll be back again!! Loved the atmosphere too... I walked around to look at the different art. Great place!

Not only are their smoothies delicious, but their food as well!! The hummus plate. The grilled cheese. The bruschetta. All amazing. And today they accidentally made my drink wrong, so Jacob came right up to the table, took it back and made me the correct drink and even up-sized it for me. Super sweet, and a relaxing place to chat with friends or study.

I always pass by this place on the way home from work and since I had no clue what to eat for dinner, I popped in! The woman behind the counter, whom I assume was also the manager, greeted me and I told her it was my first time there. She gave me a menu but told me that there was a special going on for the Mesa location's anniversary... Cheeseburger, fries and a drink for $7. Sold!  I waited not even 10 minutes while I perused their small market section, and my food was done. I didn't ask the burger to be cooked in any specific way. I just went with the flow. I tasted the fries first... Score!! Delicious and not too crispy or soft. Just perfect. Burger was next. It was very good. :)  I will come back to check out the other items in the menu and the patio as well. Thanks!!
