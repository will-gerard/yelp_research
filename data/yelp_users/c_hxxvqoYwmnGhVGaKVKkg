New ownership maybe but it's not the same here. Cashier wasn't friendly. The high chairs were so messy with caked in food. It took me many wipes to get it suitable for my son to sit in and eat in. Wires hanging down from window lights.  Napkin dispensers empty during dinner time. Come on!

So much to do! We have the season pass so I never feel as if we have to see the whole zoo. Season passes are the way to go with families! Just wish their food prices were lower.

Love this office! Love the staff! Never had a bad experience here and would highly recommend them! I have never had to wait a long time for my appointment. Dr. Di Leo and Dr. G are both phenomenal! My only complaint would be the soft leather chairs. They are hard to get out of when you're closer to your due date!

Yuck! Can I give less than 1 star?   How are medical facilities allowed to be this unkempt? Labs are generally a busy place and there weren't enough chairs to allow the patients to air while they waited. My son and I stood. I don't mind sitting on floors (I'm a teacher and I do it daily) but the gray carpet was extremely dirty and stained. I didn't want to leave having to come back to get tested for diseases we picked up while sitting on their floor!  I made an appointment online to minimize wait time. The appointment was at 9:15am. We arrived at 9am and signed in a little just after that making sure to mark the column stating we had an appointment. At 9:20 I was called back to the window to hand over the lab orders. I was frustrated because I was having to entertain an active 2 year old while standing. When I asked when we'd get called back, the nurse/clerk aid 15-20 minutes! What!?! I explained I had an appointment and would rather bring my business elsewhere. He acted bothered by the fact I didn't tell him! What's the point of the column on the sign in then?    Once we were called back, I told the nurse my son was autistic and I needed a little time to prep him. She was fine with it because it gave her time to prep the equipment for the draw. My son had to get his lead levels checked so it required the nurse to ask his ethnicity for government reporting. I told her black. She clearly didn't agree with me and said "Well, I'll just mark other because he looks of mixed race". I told her again he was black. She said "I think he's an other so I'm making an other". I should have left. I just wanted the blood drawn.   Don't go here. I'll never return.

What? This store is closed! I went by today and there were people boxing up the inventory and a sign telling me to go to other stores!

Seriously good food! The fry bread is so good and not greasy! They serve up big portions so be prepared to eat!  I love that they have expanded their delivery area and I plan on using them a lot for this (especially since the guy who delivers is HOT!)

Went in for the first time for a needed pedi. The tech spent a great amount of time massaging my legs so I was in heaven but when it came time for my callous remover, she skimmed over my feet. I want to go back and have them redo the callous remover but for a place that charges $1 to use your debit card, they might try to get more money from me. The man (the manager maybe?) Spoke on his cell phone my entire time. I could tell you all about his upcoming travel plans. When I asked to use the restroom he followed me back and stayed on the phone while I was in there! Many pedi chairs available but only 3 techs working. Customers left while I was there because of wait. Not the best vibe. Not the worst business but I'll be going elsewhere next time. I'd say save your money on this place or at least pay with cash.

Friendly staff. Clean restrooms. Large selection of hot and cold drinks. Staff always seems to be cleaning something and they can move customers through long lines quickly.

Great selection of shoes and a very large clearance section that even goes out onto the sales floor. Friendly staff weep don't hound you as you're shopping.

I'm sad to give just 2 stars on my first visit. I was hopeful for this new place. I went through the drive thru. What's up with the mic system? It was so hard to hear the employee.  And who puts the first window just a few feet from the place to order? No wonder lines here get long!   I ordered the Caniac to share with my son. I paid for the Caniac. I got home and saw they did not give me the Caniac. Packed my son back up in the car and drove back with now cold, untouched food. I chose to go inside to tell them about the order mix-up. I wasn't mad. They are new and it happens. Walking in we passed many employees out front on a break cussing and yelling. Inside employees were messing around.   I gave my food back and explained issue. The cashier took it and told cook they messed up on the order. Another random guy (maybe an employee who was off) yelled "Yea fix it!". The manager was called and she was confused because she didn't understand why she was needed. I never called her over.  She just said "do we owe you money? " I got my food back. The container felt warm and I opened it to check it over.   All is well so back to the car to load in my kid. Cold food 10 minutes later at home. The cook just added some chicken to the box of food I returned.   Not impressed and will not return. The chicken and sauce lacked flavor. The staff was mediocre at best. Let's hope this place turns around quickly!  Chick-fil-a for life now!

It's 9:01am. They should open at 9. No one is answering the phone and the lights are off. No signs saying they are closed the day after 4th of July. I wonder what's up? Crazy. My son wants to play.

UPDATE: I've been back to Jubeelieve MULTIPLE times since my initial review a year ago. My son loves it there! The owners have done so much to make this space feel warm and kid-friendly. It is clean and I never leave feeling my son didn't have a great time. They have good birthday packages. I had my son's 3rd birthday party here in February. What an amazing experience! They decorated based on my theme and helped with clean up! I could actually be a part of the birthday party and enjoy it with my son! I think there's a good assortment of toys for kids. I wish there were more places for adults to sit BUT this would take away play room. I get it. Perfect to have in AZ so my son and I can get out of the house but not be in the heat.  This is good for kids 5 and under. I like that there aren't older kids dominating the scene.  Remember to bring socks though!
