I adore this place! It is right by my house, and one of the only places I can get menudo 7 days a week. Their food is super authentic, and I wish I could work there, just so I could eat there daily!

So we went to Los Taquitos the other night, and were quite disappointed. They switched their menudo so that it's only available on the weekends. The fact that it was available on weekdays was a game changer for awhile. They also had stopped serving breakfast for some reason. The girl at the counter was pointing fingers at the kitchen and acting like she had no clue what was going on. We told her we changed our mind about eating there, and then left. When your business grows it's no excuse to lower your quality. I've been a customer for 10 years, and may never return.

I have been a customer here for 4 years. It is soo good! I am extremely picky about my hotwings, and this place hits the nail on its head. Crispy, yet juicey; spicy, yet savory! And a dozen wings fries and a large drink for about 7 dollars! I will make the drive for this place anyday:) They have really good hot dogs as well! It may look like a whole in the wall restaurant, but they got their recipes straight

Super great mexican food! I'm from a small town in southeastern Arizona with a lot of authentic mexican food restaurants, and this place was very similar. I had the hardshell chicken tacos and they were on point! The art was very interesting, to say the least. I would recommend this place to people in the area.

I'm really picky about my favorite foods, and menudo is one of them! This is the best menudo I've had in the valley so far. I'll drive about 25 minutes to get it when I want it. It is rich, a little spicy, and the tripe is cooked well. Also, it's not over abundant in hominy like many places, and they have it everyday, not just weekends. As far as their other food goes, I've never been disappointed here. The drive thru is convenient, but still takes some time to get your food. They're often generous with their portions, which is awesome!

First of all, I saw the other reviews and didn't think that this place could be that horrible... I was incorrect. Horrible front desk staff. They don't care about customers and aren't timely. I have to go to them for a final appointment and will never return. My husband and I were actually yelled at for being on time for our original appointment, which should have been warning enough! Enter at your own risk.

This is the closest place to my house that offers decent menudo. It's awesome and spicy and rich! They have a decent salsa bar, and chips which is a bonus. They're carne asada is delicious, but sometimes their portions are a little more sparser than others. All in all good Mexican food from someone that's picky about it.

First of all, I arrived early and waited so I could get serviced in a timely manner. They are supposed to open at 830, but the workers streamed in nonchalantly at 840. I was already late for work, because I knew that I couldn't come in on my lunch break. The woman who services me was an older Hispanic woman with long hair. She didn't smile once. Something was taken from my mailbox and I'm assuming it was by my mail carrier. It didn't have an address because it was dropped off by a friend. I didn't think that it would be taken! She told me that they process millions of pieces of mail everyday...which I obviously get. But if the PO isn't getting any government funding, maybe they should work a little bit harder so people would be happier and use their service more. This woman talked to me like I was an idiot, and she's lucky that I hadn't had coffee yet! I wanted to rip her a new one. Customer service is customer service! We all have jobs that we work hard at. You aren't special! I'm really unhappy with this experience. I wish that I could give 0 stars!

I went to Canteen for a friend's birthday dinner. It has a great atmosphere! The pineapple Patron was infused in house, and our server was super hot. After a few samples of the Patron everyone let her know that. I had the carne asada tacos and they were really good. I have had carne asada from everywhere(including Mexico), and this was easily in my top 5. It is a little bit pricey, but its Mill, what do you expect?

They were closed when I stopped by during business hours, with no note on the door and the open sign still on. I'm not a fan!
