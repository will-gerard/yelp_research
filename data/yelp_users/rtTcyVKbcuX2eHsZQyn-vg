If I could put zero stars I would. I went in at spent $55 on a pedicure and a manicure with Gel polish. She use some kind of cheap gel that made my nails all lumpy. I had her fixed 2 of them before I left and she used OPI which was great but the other 8 fingers look like shit. I came back to have them fixed they told me I had to wait an hour after I called an hour before. I will never come here again and I hope people read this and don't waste time or money. They think they're saving money by being cheap using cheap polish and all its doing is getting people in one time that will never return.

I have been coming here for almost 20 years. I eat here 3 to 5 times a week, it's awesome An the sushi chef and owner is amazing. Don't let the location fool you this is the best sushi in Phoenix for a great price. Truly I cannot say enough about this place.
