Place was awesome! Worked with Shelley Clark and she was super cool. I bought 2 American eagles and price was barely over spot!! I will continue to do business with them on a regular basis. Great local source for silver, gold and coins!

Took my car in for service at Berge and had a horrible experience. This was the first time I have used the dealership and was completely disappointed with the whole event. Not only did they not repair my car properly they provided zero help in a solution. They were rude and took every opportunity to bad mouth the dealership i bought my car from.   What should have been a simple CV boot repair has left me stranded with no car for the weekend and will either cost me a full day of work or the cost of a rental car. Not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service.   I know VW is better than this, I have owned 6 VW's in the past 10 years, and in a bad economy this kinda of service will severely  damage a reputation.   From now on I will drive the extra 50 miles round trip to have the service department at camelback VW work on my car. They have always provided awesome service.

Worse customer service ever. I called on Sunday around 4 in the afternoon on 10-23-11. Guy answers " long wongs 60 & stapley " I say " hey just need to place an order for pick up" the guy says " hold one" 15 minutes later still holding. After 20 min I hang up call back guy answers " long wongs 60& stapley" i say "hey man just need to place that order for pick up " and the guy hangs up on me. I will never spend another dollar at this place
