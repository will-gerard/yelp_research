In my quest for the best Mexican food (somewhere in which the refried beans are not from a can).  I happened upon Mariscos!  It was fabulous and I will return often and work my way through the menu.  I had the camarone culichi, which came with rice, salad and beans.  It was a lot of food, enough to take home for a second meal.  Next time I will try a margarita....it looked very tasty.  The establishment was quaint, it looked very clean and they were very welcoming!

Ordered an egg salad sandwich.  It was okay but bland.  Would try something else next time if there is a next time.  Also the sourdough bread requested was not sourdough received.

Tia's is a great place. They have been in business over 10 years and it is very clean. Their nail techs are polite, and they don't talk on their cell phones while they are working on you (I know you know exactly what I am talking about.) And they don't chatter among themselves while they are working with you. It is a peaceful environment.  I travel the extensively and I have had Shellac nails put on in many cities and this is BY FAR, THE BEST, ever!  I highly recommend them!

I use to love taking guests/clients/co-workers in town to the Rusty....but when Psychobilly band plays,  I have be careful who I take...   Jimmy and his raunchy lyrics...get kind of old after a while.  And he yells ever 5 minutes to TIP the F**king band...that gets old too!   Handle Bar J's is larger not as quiant as R.S.  but classier I guess.   Bring back the other band!

A fabulous choice in Carefree.  I can't believe it took me so long to visit!  The rooftop bar and dining is cozy, romantic and quaint!  I suggest you  make a reservation for that, as it is quite a coveted spot.  The menu is so extensive, with so many choices it's almost hard to choose what to eat.

I was having a client meeting in Phoenix and searched Yelp for a coffee shop to meet.  I was excited to support a locally owned establishment (even though I am a Starbucks shareholder!)   I arrived  and a very nice gentleman waited on me.  The tea selection was really great.  I found a table, and had to wipe it off myself from the crumbs that were left from the previous customer.  When my client arrived, I asked her what she wanted to drink and she only wanted water, I waited while the young gal (now the only one working) made a coffee for someone and when she waited on me, I asked for a water, she seemed irritated and she filled a cup of water from the faucet and was handing it to me when I had to ask for ice.  She was clearly irritated that I asked for ice in the water.   My client noticed that too and felt bad.  The atmosphere was nice, the music was at a nice moderate level where you could conduct business, read a book or concentrate on your computer.  I might give it another visit if I am in that part of town again, to see if the young gal has gotten a clue that that client is the one that makes her paycheck, but I won't make a special trip.

Stopped in for dining at the bar.  The kelp salad was very fresh and the sushi rolls were AMAZING!  They were the freshest that I have had in a LONG time!  I look forward to visiting again and trying more and maybe bumping them up to a 5 star!

This hotel is a great hidden gem. It is newer, clean with all the amenities. Great access to the I-15 to get you to the strip in minutes. Self parking is easy if that is your choice.  Excellent fitness center as well.

I always like to give places a second chance and Blue Martini, I have done so, and I am done!  To sum it up....the food is not that good at all.  The spinach dip was served and it clearly had been frozen b/c parts of it were cold.  When we told them they took it to the kitchen and clearly MICROWAVED it b/c it returned to us SCORCHED.  Come on! And the $15. glass of wine is terrible!  The service is horrible, b/c there are so many young people that work there that have NO concept of what service entails.  It will be a passing fancy in LV, I am certain of that. If 1/2 star was an option that would be my choice. Sorry! Raise the bar!

Took some guests in from out of town and it was so LOUD that we got up from our table and went to Bar North to dine outside....same menu, but not quite what we had hoped to experience.  Tiny round tables to dine...just because the employees may like loud music, let's not forget who pays the bill!   I ordered brussels sprouts and they arrived and they weren't even trimmed up....an oversight I hope.

I give Blanco 2 stars not because of the food, but because of the experience.  I have been there at least 4 times and have had mediocre service.  Why do I return?  Well, I love the White House Margarita, the chips and guac are wonderful.  But all of the teens in their super short cotton tennis dresses are lacking what it takes to make a dining experience receive 5 stars.   Most of my not so good experiences have been on the patio....it's as if they forgot I exist, until after they finish their chitter chatter amongst themselves.   I keep going back b/c I want Blanco to succeed, but one day, I will just give up if things stay marginal!

It's my own fault.....I keep going back and each time my experience is different.   It's close to home and they do have good food, but HELP, WHY do I have to ASK for a plate and a napkin after my food has arrived??  Pay attention servers!

A hidden jem!  Quiet, nice atmosphere with very attentive service.  Pad Thai was delicious and the thai basil with shrimp with fresh veggies and a flavorful broth that I wanted to drink!  We finished off the meal with coconut and chocolate chunck ice cream!   I will be back!

Quick service.  Lucky for me, I just needed new rubber tips put on some heels and they could do it while I waited.   My neighborhood spot closed and another shoe repair would take 2-3 days!  Thanks for saving the heels!

Love this place!  Culinary treat! This visit I tried the Mescolanza and Bruxelles. Both were so flavorful.  Some thought was put in to this menu!  I can't wait to try the pizza on my next visit.  I also love garden out front.

I have eaten lunch here and the atmosphere is quite stylish.  The food was wonderful: the flavors were well composed!  I had the soup, salmon and the brussel sprouts with apple bacon,,,,oh so delicious!    I have also been there in the evening for a drink and appetizer.   If you are looking for a healthy appetizer on the "STARTER" menu, keep looking.....they don't have anything available....but a couple salads....not quite what I had in mind! The patio is quaint for dining or a drink with a fireplace and a covered patio, makes you forget your are near a parking lot!   Excellent!

I had the Panang with chicken-spice 3-that was enough spice for me! Lots of food for lunch.  Great meal.

This was my first visit.  Very large, many places to sit and a fabulously huge patio, that is quiet and doesn't face a parking lot....that is hard to find in Scottsdale!   Lot's of RED chairs, but they are comfy.  Sat at the bar  which was cozy and comfy, ordered some bruchetta, which was unique and tasty....the bartender seemed a little preoccupied with her 'texts' , not so keen on that.   Nice place for a date or a group.  I will certainly go back and explore more of the menu and wine selections!

My first visit to Pomo was quite nice.  The decor is stylish and for once you don't have to stare at cars if you eat on the patio....not the case for most restaurants in Scottsdale/ Phoenix.  The ingredients were fresh and wonderful.  I enjoyed the Caprese salad, the mozzarella was wonderful, as was the tomato and bread.   It's nice to hear Italian being spoken by the staff,  The wine selection was limited because they were out of a few of the choices I wanted, but I will certainly return!

Great place to watch sports. Beer is always good, but the menu needs a little help.   Depending on what you order, but the nachos are embarrassing!   Who uses cheese sauce on nachos....it makes sense at a baseball park, but come on Blue 32....step it up!    The air handling system is horrible too.  Bring a scarf and parka, for if you sit at the high tables, you could freeze to death.

Spotted Donkey....you have redeemed yourself in my mind.  After a very mediocre visit with poor service...I promised myself to return to give you a chance at redemption. And you succeeded!   I ordered the queso,,,yummy,,,and the bread with it is delicious!   An a beef enchilada which was very substantial and so favorful!   Nice job!

I drove by 2 breakfast joints on Scottsdale Rd on Sat. am and the wait was 25mins.  Then it dawned on me that The Herb Box was in Old Town.  YEAH!  We walked right in, we were seated.  What a great place, cozy and great patio and the food was great, as always!

Once again....now a visit for happy hour.  Great prices and the food was delicious and generous quantities.  They have a wonderful patio with pleasant music and a fountain, and live greenery, so nice to sit in a patio that doesn't look at cars....and they have heaters too! .....I love this place.

I was able to get right in.  Environment was good but the music was not relaxing.  My shellac manicure started to chip after one week.  Unfortunately I'm out of town now or I would have gone in and made them fix it for free.   I guess it makes sense now that you could walk right in versus Tia's which is always booked.

I had the Lump Crab Hash- the sweet potatoes and caramelized onions were great a combo.  The hostess is darling and so friendly- and a great wait staff.  My date had the breakfast burrito- which was huge topped with a beautiful avocado.

Four of us dined here, I had huevos ranchero it was a very good selection.  One friend had a scramble and she said it was not warm at all.  The other two were satisfied with their dishes.
