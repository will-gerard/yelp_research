Worst managed restaurant we've ever experienced. I was a little uncomfortable with the very unhappy young boy (10 years old at the most) who was handing out roses to the moms for Mother's Day and then later gathering wood in a big trash barrel while the Manager was sitting at the bar and then later outside on his cell phone for long stretches of time. The restaurant was busy and there was 1 poor waitress doing an amazing job holding it all together while her boss avoided the restaurant and customers at all costs. Regardless of the 1.5 hour wait time for food the Manager never made the rounds to the tables or did anything to assist the only waitress there. When we complained about the 1.5 hour wait both the Manager and cook came to our table with excuses and offered us a very generous free dessert!! Are you kidding me?! We had been there with toddlers for an hour and a half and they thought we would be interested in keeping our boys up even further past their bad time for a free dessert? As we were leaving, we saw the Manger on his phone at the end of the sidewalk out front. We stopped and expressed our disappointment again. The Manager told us that 3 servers called off tonight, to which I replied, "then you should be inside helping the waitress that did show up, not out here hiding on your cell phone." It's terribly unfortunate that this restaurant has such incompetent staff, because the food was actually really good. We will never be back.
