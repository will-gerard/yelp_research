The yellow chicken curry and shrimp pad Thai were great. Trying to order online was a bit of a hassle but over all they delivered rather quickly. Good to know it's right down the street too.

If a ZERO star was possible this is what they deserve. My boyfriend tried to surprise me on Valentine's Day with a delivery to my work since he was home sick and couldn't bring them himself. By 5 pm the office closed and I had received nothing. He received an email "confirmation" for delivery at 7 pm. That is impossible because the doors are obviously locked at 5. We tried calling the customer service line that day earlier in the afternoon but their automated machine said "all florists are too busy to answer your call". When he called the next day to get a hold of a real person they promised a re delivery the next day to our home instead. Again, NOTHING showed. Now it's Tuesday and when I finally got a hold of a person to get a credit issued they won't do it because I wasn't the one who placed the order. Never mind it was paid for by OUR joint bank account.

The only "bad" thing I can say about this place is trying to find it. Especially if you're not familiar with the air park. Other than that everything was great. Not too crowded but not a ghost town. Nice place for a business luncheon. The ladies working were all very friendly and quick to refill drinks. The pulled pork sandwich was absolutely wonderful! Reasonably priced for the amount of food on your plate.

Great food & fast service. You can't beat the prices either. Small space inside so it gets a little crowded during the lunch rush.
