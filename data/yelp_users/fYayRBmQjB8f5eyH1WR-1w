I love this park, and my dogs do too!  It's beautiful and well maintained.   Even on a busy day there's still plenty of room to walk around, exercise, or have a picnic!

Mel is great. She's compassionate, and will take great care of your four-legged loves. I have a lab, so I'm not picky about her having a perfectly prissy cut, but I know she always has a ball when I take her here. There always seems to be poodles and malteses and labradoodles here, so I'm certain she specializes in fuzzy breeds. But needless to say, my dog and I always leave happy!

Good food, good ambiance, good prices.   I have been coming here for as long as I can remember.  The fish is always fresh, except for maybe a time or two in the dead of summer. But eating sushi in the summer in Az is always kinda iffy anyway!  It's usually pretty busy here, but the wait is never too long for a table. I love sitting at the sushi bar here, the chefs are friendly and entertaining.!

I just recently tried this place for the first time. My boyfriend and I shared the Pizza Nortena, which was like heaven in my mouth. I love those fried chicken chimichangas with the spicy cream cheese sauce on them (pollo fundido I believe they are called) and I love pizza. This is basically pollo fundido on top of pizza. Sooooooo good, and gigantic. We had left overs, which tasted a-may-zing cold. The chips and salsa are delish too, and they aren't afraid to refill them for you, which is good for me because I like to spoil my din din by going to town on freebies.  The service here is also good. The servers are nice and attentive. And a big plus for me is that it is CLEAN. I cant even count how many times I have had Mexican food in a filthy restaurant. Now, don't get me wrong, I love hole in the wall places, but in a sit down place that charges normal, not hole in the wall prices, I don't want to swat at fruit flies while eating my pollo fundido. I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but I will definitely go back.

I started coming to Alta Vista when my black lab/Aussie mix was a little over a year old. Since she was a little pup she's always been the dog that has something wrong with her/gets into something she shouldn't/injures herself by acting crazy. But she's adorable and I love her to pieces...  I first came to Alta Vista when a friend recommended them for their hours and reasonable prices. I was living downtown so they were super close. Right away I was impressed with the fact they could get me in that day for my pups broken toe nail. She was in a lot of pain and I knew she need help immediately. The wait was probably about 20 min, which wasn't bad at all. I am not bothered by long wait times at a vet or doctor office. It's not a restaurant people, get over your 'first world problems'. If there's a long wait, assume another creature needs more attention than yours! Jeeze! Anway... The vet tec and vet were both very nice and professional. It turned out Sadie would need a small surgery to remove her toe, as the broken nail was super gnarly. It was expensive, but I wasn't pressured at all and they made me feel very comfortable! I had been to vets before that treated me like a deadbeat loser when I was nervous about prices. They took great care of her, and even let her stay there all day after her surgery as I had to work late. I have taken Sadie back to AV for 2 years now, and I don't even live downtown anymore! I drive clear across town, because they are the only vet I will trust. As long as I'm living in Arizona I will only take my dogs here, and I always recommend them to people looking for a vet!

Love Grazie. They have, in my opinion, the best italian-style pizza in the valley. I made my way through most of the pizza menu. I love the complimenti alla mama, the vegetariana, and the sofia. i think their crust is what does it for me. Its so thin, and crispy, but still soft and chewy, and has the perfect seasonings. Their marinara sauce is also really, really good!  This place is totally a hidden gem, even though its crazy on the weekends, it's completely dead on weeknights. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because their menus are always really dirty, and some of the servers are kind of a-holes. They also seem to only want to cater to large parties on the weekends, so if you show up for a date you'll most likely get an awful table. But the pizza is so good it almost makes up for it!

Sunflower Market is hands down my favorite place to grocery shop EVER! They have an amazing selection of organic fruits, and vegetables. They have delicious soups everyday. They sell Boars Head cold cuts for cheaper than any other store I have shopped at. Their freshly prepared tuna stuffed tomatoes are banging. Their roasted red pepper hummus is the best I've ever had. Their frozen section is full of organic and all natural selections. Their beer selection is THE BEST, and they have a decent wine selection with really good deals.Their prices are better than all other natural grocery stores, and even better than some big name stores. I love this place!

The ice cream here is delicious, but the service is horrendous. There always seems to be 10+ people working here, yet they often seemed annoyed to have patrons.   This place is adorable, and has deep roots in old Az. Come on, Sugar Bowl, step it up a little.

I have to agree with the other reviews.   I lived here from January 2008- January 2009.  This place blows and I absolutely hated living here.  The units are outdated, dark, and depressing.  If you live on the first floor you have no wall on your patio, aka no privacy. Kitchen appliances were terrible, carpet was cheap and uncomfortable. If you don't have a washer dryer in your unit, there's only one public laundry room that had 4 washers and 4 dryers, for like 800 people.   The PARKING. UGH!!! The worst. If you live here, you only get one assigned covered parking space. Mind you, there are only about 12 "free" parking spaces. So, if you have a roommate, you guys are screwed. If you want to have friends over, tell them to get a ride or take the bus!   When we moved out, we were charged $900 for "damaged carpet". We never had pets, weren't smokers, maybe had 2 or 3 stains on the carpet. $900, what a scam! Had we known we would've replaced it ourselves before moving out for half the price! When we tried to inquire as to what the damage was they wouldn't return our calls or speak to us about it.   They also have a pretty open pet policy, No weight restrictions, so I was basically always stepping in huskey shit. Not their fault if people don't clean up after their dogs, I understand, but honestly this must be one of the only complex's in Scottsdale that doesn't have weight restrictions for pets. Which sounds like a good thing? Maybe to people that are cruel and think it's okay to have one or  more 50+ pound dogs in a tiny space. I however think if you have large dogs you should live, I dunno, in a house? Maybe one with a back yard?  The only reason to live here is because it's somewhat cheap. This place made me never want to live in apartments ever again, and I haven't since.

I don't understand all of the great reviews of this place. The food here is pretty blah. I feel like they use the same 3 ingredients in every dish, as if they don't want to actually supply the ingredients that the dishes need. Everything tastes ok, but just really off. Maybe that it was they mean by 'fusion'? Fusing Asian food with random meh flavor?  The staff here is pretty disappointing, also, which is the main reason why I don't return. I have tried eating here probably 5 or 6 times between dining in and taking out. The last time was so disappointing. I was second hand embarrassed for this restaurant. Their staff that night, of 4 or 5 twenty-somethings, all stood at the front of the restaurant talking loudly about idiotic things they had done over the weekend. My boyfriend and i couldnt even have a conversation because we could hear ever single word they were saying. So rude. And annoying. Honestly, they spent a good 35 minutes doing this(the entire time we were there, I'm sure they kept going even after we left). It was sad really, that a business would tolerate this kind of behavior from their employees. My first job at Pizza Hut when I was 16 wouldn't even allow that kind of BS.  So, basically, their meh food doesn't make up for their UGH service, therefore making take out not worth it, and dining in miserable. Sorry Totti :(

I think this is my favorite Italian restaurant! I have really really loved everything I have tried here. My boyfriend loves Italian food, I do not. However, this place is amazing. The food is great. We always have a nice server. We're usually the youngest couple in the dining room, but hey, that's south Scottsdale for ya!

Update: The first 5 or 6 times I ate at Uncle Sal's it was amazing. However, it has gotten worse and worse since then. On our most recent visit (on a Tuesday night) it was pretty busy. After being ignored at the hostess stand for what felt like 5 minutes, I was finally told it would be "about 15 minutes" for a table for two. After 45 minutes to an hour, and after every other group of people who came in after us were seated, we were finally seated in that "oh, shit, I forgot to seat these people who have been waiting way too long that even though I wrote their name down on the list I seemed to keep skipping over them for no apparent reason". It was uncomfortable. We were finally sat in the back section of the restaurant where there were a good 5 or 6 open tables around us. After waiting 10 minutes for our flustered waitress (who never apologized for the wait or introduced herself) to finally come over, she asked if we were ready to order our food yet. Didn't tell us any specials, didn't ask if we have any questions, didn't even give us a chance to order a bottle of wine... We saw her one more time the rest of the night when she brought our check with out even thanking us.  Oh, and the food was disgusting on that night. My pene vodka tasted like frozen Michelana's, and my boyfriends shrimp fettucini alfredo was inedible. The shrimp were so over cooked they were hard and crunchy, and the alfredo sauce was so tastless and heavy it gave us both a stomach ache. At this point I was so annoyed I didn't even have the energy to complain to the arrogant host/manager that forgot about us for an hour.  Hopefully in the summer time it will have slowed down a bit and they will get their shit together. They obviously don't operate well when they're busy. It was like being on Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares

China Wok...You're like a good friend I can always count on! I get delivery from here usually once a week, or whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps. Yes, the food isn't amazing or super authentic, but it's really tasty. And affordable. AND- what's really important- the food is always piping hot when it's delivered! I usually get the broccoli beef, house spicy chicken or sesame chicken, and either the hot and sour soup or egg drop. It's all good!

AMAZING. The cheese steak is the cats pajamas. The chicken parm sandwich is heavenly. I would like to try other items, but I cannot stray from my usual as they are too delicious. Would be five stars if their service was a teensy bit faster, but not a big deal. It's worth the wait!

I had a great first time experience here tonight! The staff were super friendly and accommodating and patient with showing me how to use the equipment!  And yeah the instructional film is super amazing. I would like a copy of it! Haha. I was lucky to come with some more experienced friends- but they left me in the dust once we got there so the sweet little brunette girl helped me out a lot. I'll definitely be back- as soon as my wrist muscles recover!

Favorite breakfast. Used to come here every Sunday, now it's less frequent, but the food is as good as ever. We never have to wait for a table, and the servers here are all really nice. My coffee cup is always full, which is a big plus. I haven't tried any of their lunch options, but I bet they're just as good as breakfast. My mouth is salivating now just thinking of the home fries.... Ask for them instead of hash browns. They ever disappoint!

Wow. I have known this place existed for years, but I always figured it was just a chain and probably wouldn't be very impressive. I went here for lunch the other day for the first time, and it was soooooooo good!!! I just got the basic gyro pita, and it was really really tasty. Probably the best gyro I have ever had (and I have had many). Everything tasted fresh, the meat wasn't too greasy, the pita was soft and fluffy and the taziki(sp?) was very good. The fries were also delicious. Nice and crispy. My lunch date got the Greek fries which were other worldly. I will be ordering those next time! Their prices are very reasonable, and our waitress was nice and not annoying! I will be getting lunch here more often now, especially since I work directly across the street!

I like Buffalo. They always buy my stuff, and I like looking around at what they have.    I think the reason a lot of people don't like this place is because they try to sell ugly nasty shit that no one wants to wear. It's a recession, so, you're not going to get top dollar for your J Crew tee shirts that you bought 4 years ago that have pit stains and are hideous. Duh.

I like Sauce, a lot. I like that for a 'quick-meal' place, they have a menu with a ton of variety. I like the brick oven pizzas, with that charred edge. The cheese they use is delicious. They have a new thicker hand-stretched crust, which is pretty good if you're offended by their normal thin crust. The hand stretched also appears to be a little larger, and is more filling than the thin crust, so it's good to share.  The white bean and potato soup is the reason why I only try to come here on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Yes, it is THAT good.  The pasta, salads, panini's are all good too. And they have a decent wine selection.   In the summer they offer great dinner deals. I believe last summer was a pizza, a salad and 2 glasses of wine for $20. Seriously, thats a steal and a half dot com.

I love Noodles Ranch! I was skeptical at first, because the name is so campy and silly! hahahaha. Any way... I only get take out, because I am not a huge fan of the sit down service. It seems like they only ever have one server working, and it kind of takes forever. But the food is delish, so take out it is!

Flo's is my favorite place to get Chinese in the valley. This location, especially. I am not a fan of the one in the promenade... The hot and sour soup here is AH-MAY-ZING. Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The broth. The pork. The shrimp. The mushrooms. Sooooo good. I hate when I order hot and sour soup from a restaurant and it tastes like salty beef broth with peas and carrots and those canned bamboo shoot things. I also hate when it's the consistency of jello. But Flo's is always perfect. Just the amount of spice and vinegar, the perfect thickness, perfect amount of egg that's actually stirred in correctly and not just giant globs...  Their other dishes I've had are good too. The ingredients are fresh. Their noodle dishes are pretty basic tho, so if you like tons of ingredients, maybe don't get one. I however think they're delicious. My only real complaint about Flo's is the service. Everyone always seems extremely stressed out, from the hostesses to the servers. Maybe they need a few more employees? But it's not a big deal for me, I usually just get take out. Or lunch. And it's actually great for lunch, super fast, and fresh, and you totes get your money's worth!!

This store, man! It's the best. Perfect place to shop, or kill time, or boredom, or all of the above!  Browsing here is just fun, i always manage to pick up a few random items, and usually spend less than 20 bucks. Also a great place to buy a unique gift. They even sell fun gift boxes! Their end of season sales are superb, too. We picked up a few lawn chairs for $20 each last August, and obviously in Arizona. managed to get plenty of use out of them!

Best cupcakes I've ever had! I have been obsessed with cupcakes since before they were cool and cutesy. Honestly, they have alway been my favorite dessert.  I have had cupcakes from here three times now and have yet to be disappointed! I love the (I think it's called) super nova, and the coconut and the plain Jane. I'm more of a vanilla and lemon cake person, and a cream cheese or butter cream frosting fan, than anything chocolate, so I have yet to try their chocolate cakes. I also hate red velvet cake, so I wouldn't try that one. But I have absolutely enjoyed the cupcakes I have had, and can't wait to use my groupon for more, if I can't make it there before it expires!

Little Chicago is the best. They are about a 5 min drive from my house, and they have free delivery since I'm usually too lazy to make that drive. Their pizza is super tasty, and it's cut into squares so you get those 4 fun trianglie corner pieces along with the big square pieces! I like that it has a thin crust that is light and crispy with out tasting like a saltine or melba toast. Its the perfect combo of crisp and soft. The cheese they use is divine as well. they always use the perfect amount and it's just the right amount of saltiness and greasyness. I like their sausage, however I believe they make it home made? Sometimes it's too fennel-ie for me, so I don't really order it anymore. Their specialty pizzas are also very good. And their cheese sticks. Yum! I like that they are called cheese sticks, and not mozzarella sticks or fried mozzarella or other "fancy" names like that. They are just delicious sticks of cheese that happen to be fried and taste like heaven. I always want to try their wings, but have yet to since I am not yet sick of the cheese sticks. I haven't tried any of the pasta dishes yet, either, but would like to. My boyfriend always gets their sandwiches for lunch and I have been lucky enough to eat his left overs from time to time (I work too far away for lunch time treats from Little Chicago unfortunately). Let me tell you, they are TASTY! Tasty tasty little submarine sandwich gems. My mouth salivates just thinking of them. Anyways, eat here. It's the best.

Yummy. This is my favorite place to go for Viet in Phoenix. I would go more often if it was closer to where I live. Service is sometimes lacking, but it's not fancy food, and the prices are great, so that makes up for it. Good thai iced tea!

Their clothes are okay. Some of the stuff is tacky, but some is pretty cute. The problem is the quality of the merchandise. I had browsed here a few times, but it wasn't until my most recent visit that I tried stuff on. Everything felt like burlap, and made me feel like I was having an allergic reaction. Although the prices are cheap-ish, they are still too high for the quality of the clothes. I can't imagine wearing such uncomfortable stuff!

This is the best spa I have ever been to! It was my first Bliss experience, but will not be my last. I came here with my mom and sister for some pre-holiday relaxation. The first thing I noticed upon walking into the spa was its chic and modern design. I loved the boutique-ie feel of it. Living in the Phoenix area, I'm used to the resort spas being a little too "Peruvian pan-flute-ie" for my tastes. I loved that at Bliss, the atmosphere was relaxing without being overly "spa like". And the cheese and brownies are amaze. I think I are an entire wheel of cheese that day. Onto the services! I had an amazing facial with Cynthia(I think that was her name). Definitely the best facial I have ever had. Not only was it extremely relaxing, but my skin actually looked fabulous after. I'm used to looking like I got stung by 50 bees after I get a facial, which is why I almost never get them. I would definitely get a facial here again. Next I had the blissage 49 with Suzi who was also really good! I definitely wouldn't say this was relaxing- but it was an epic, therapeutic message that I definitely needed. Even my chiropractor noticed when I came in two weeks later that I had hardly any tension in my shoulders and neck. I have never talked to my therapist while getting a message, and I thought it was kind of weird at first that Suzi was so chatty- but I was so grateful she was. The conversation helped distract me from the intense, healing pressure she was applying to my shoulders. Almost 3 weeks later and my back still feels the best it has in years. Lastly I had a shellac manicure and a pedicure with Amy. She was such a doll!! Absolutely the sweetest person, super easy to talk to! And she did an amazing job on my nails. Even trying different colors on my nails to help me decide which color I wanted. Very fun to hang out with her. My mother and sister couldn't stop raving about all of their services, and we are already trying to plan our next trip back!

I came here with my parents who happen to live in Cave Creek. They were going on and on and on... and on about it, so the last time I was visiting (and was promised free dinner) they suggested we go here.   Upon walking in, I wasn't very impressed. Very small building, kinda dark, and everything was blue (duh!). Also, it smelled like cooked eggs! Not like sulfur, but like cooked scrambeled eggs?  However, it was crazy busy! I immediately saw that they serve burgers made with buffalo. I LOVE BUFFALO. So, I got a little excited.  My parents told me that the "Blue Burger" was bomb, but, the menu clearly states no substitutions for specialty burgers. Aw man!! Cause I was really wanting the Blue Burger at this point, which comes with angus beef. Techincally, I could have "built my own" blue burger, but it would have cost about $17 dollars which is just silly! So I sucked it up and ordered a non buffalo meat Blue Burger. (with a salad instead of fries, this was the day after Christmas so I need to cut back on the calories!)  The burger was delish!!!!! So good! Oh, and they ask you how you want it cooked. I got it medium rare, and it was perfect!  I will definately come back here when I get the chance!   It would be rad if they could update the specialty burgers to have your choice of angus beef, grass fed beef, buffalo, or veggie. Then Blue Burger would be with out a doubt 5 stars!

Ew. I wish I could give zero stars, but then I wouldn't be able to complain about how awful this place is. Worst paradise bakery, ever. EVER. I'm surprised I didn't get food poisining eating here. My sandwich (chicken walnut) had a teaspoon of chicken salad on it, whith maybe one walnut, and mealy tomato, and wet soggy lettuce. The only good part about it was the bread. It was the tiniest sandwich I've ever gotten at a sandwich place. My boyfriend's club sandwich had gelatinous ham and turkey on it, like oscar meyer style. We also ordered a box of 15 chippers. They were AWFUL. It was as if the broke all of the chippers into even smaller pieces. The oatmeal chocolate chip ones didnt have a single chocolate chip. Someone must have forgotten to add them to the batter. The dark chocolate white chip ones were so dry, and the lemon ones tasted like butter and remorse.  I seriously think this location totally blows. The other locations I go to are always good, but this place is baaaaad. Mall food court bad. Jesus, get it together!

The best, most delicious cakes ever made!! I was never a huge fan of bundt cakes, I always thought they were kind of dry and boring and blah... But then a client of mine brought me a bundlette for Christmas a few years back, and I've been obsessed ever since. My favorite is the lemon raspberry! It's to die! I die ten times every time I eat it! The girls that work at this location are very sweet(punny!) also. I'm glad that this place is far away from my house, because if it were closer I would weigh 300 pounds.

This place is the best. I only order the cottage pie or bangers and mash. They have like 100 different types of pasties, but I've come to realize that the more traditional ones are the safer way to go. Plus I'm an Irish girl and I love meat and potatoes. I prefer this location to the Tempe one. It's much larger and the service is a lot friendlier. Plus the patio is amazing. Also, the Tempe one has been "expanding" forever and it feels as tho it will never be done.

You know when you go to a hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant that happens to serve sushi, but you think 'there's no way I'm ordering sushi at a non sushi restaurant'? I feel like that sushi would taste like Moira sushi.   The fish here is not fresh. That's really about it. They can have the most clever fusion ideas, 'cool' decor, a rad happy hour menu, but the fish tastes minutes away from expiration. There's no excuse for this. I've come here twice: once when they very first opened, and again very recently. Both times the fish was disturbingly fishy.   Also, their soy sauce is not a good quality one. Extremely salty and concentrated. I had to add water to it. (and I LOVE salt)

I have always been a fan of West Elm, however on my most recent visit I was less than impressed.   Apparently I came during the 'once yearly' or 'end of year bed/bath sale'. This sounds like a good thing, yes? No. Not good. Apparently a sale here means get rid of all the old and don't put out ANY of the new until all the old, picked over, sad stuff is gone. The 'bath' section was reduced to 2 colors of towels, 2 bath mats, and 3 or 4 shower curtains.   I hate when stores do this. Sale or no sale, I was looking to redecorate my bathroom this weekend, and would have liked to purchased some new stuff. First world problems, I know...  None of this would have really bothered me, except that a couple of the women who work here have some serious sticks up their rear ends. Not helpful, or friendly. I will stick to online shopping from now on.

This is the best frozen yogurt I have ever had. In fact, I never really liked frozen yogurt until I came here.   They seem to have twice as many flavors as other yogurt places. My favorites and strawberry, cheesecake, french vanilla, and madagascar vanilla. All mixed together, with cheesecake bites and strawberries. Sooooooo good.   It's also pretty clean here, and it smells so good. I want a yogurt land scented candle.

Probably my favorite restaurant in old town. One of my favorite places for French in Az. The food is alway great, which is important to me. I hate when restaurants aren't consistent.  My only complaint is the service. I have had great service here, but it's also not been so great. I understand that it is a small place, but when I'm asked if I have a reservation when coming in on a Tuesday night when there are only two other tables eating? That is kind of odd, and frankly it comes off as rude. Asking two people if they have a dinner reservation on a slow night, and then acting frantic to seat us at a table... Calm down Petit Maison, we get it, you're a pretty 'big deal', but you're not too good for us...

I used to get Jimmy Johns all of the time when I was down at the good ol' UofA, so now that I work on Mill I was excited to try them again! I don't know if this location is different, if my taste buds have evolved since I was 19, or if I have to be completely shit faced to eat here, but this place is ewwwwww Like others have said, they use way to much mayo. WAY TOO MUCH. And no other condiment really... Their subs consist of 90% lettuce/sprouts, 8% mayo and 2% misc(meaning mystery meat, tomatoes, maybe cheese, etc) I just don't get why anyone would want to eat here? Unless they're drunk! I would totally eat here drunk, but then again, I'll eat ANYTHING when I'm drunk...

Julia is the best. She does a great Brazilian. I have been to a couple other girls here and neither compared to Julia. She really takes her time to make sure everything is perfect, and she's super sweet and fun to talk to. Definitely makes it a much less awkward experience!

Best fast food sub place ever! Everyone that works here is super friendly. I love the club sub! Ask for it Mike's way. But no oil. My only complaint, they put way waaaaaay to much oil on the subs! But if you get them with out it they are Sooooooooooooo good!

This review boarders on the 3-4 star range, so I'll just go with four. The pizza was alright. The crust was good, but like other yelpers have said, a little too soggy in the middle. I also wasn't digging the ricotta cheese they used on the pizza. Perhaps it was more authentic than I'm used to, or perhaps it was just gross. I'm not sure. Five stars for the tiramisu. Holy cannoli it was delicious! the best I've ever had.  The layout of the restaurant was nice, and I enjoyed the Italian music playing in the background.  It's a small restaurant, so make sure you call ahead and make a reservation if you don't want to wait. I will most likely return, but only for that amazing tiramisu and some wine!

These are the best donuts I have ever tasted. I only wish I had discovered them sooner, and I wish the lady in the drive-thru didn't always yell at me... but other than that I have no complaints. The raspberry filled, buttermilk bar, and bear claw thingie are my fave

This place blows like a con air. Lamest crowd/staff ever. Over priced drinks, bad music, bad vibe, bad location. AVOID!

Must update my review- the owner of this place is a d-bag! They were so concerned with their lame karaoke night that they wouldn't let us sing any songs that involved "bad words". Also 90% of the people there weren't even drinking- which isn't a big deal except for the fact that my friends and I's $50 bar tab a piece (for like 4 mediocre drinks) didn't warrant more leniency for karaoke. It's not like we were trying to sing Wu-Tang. But seriously every 10 minutes the owner or manager was running over like a total prude yelling at the dj. Lame lame lame. Will never come here again. This place is like a church retreat- but even worse. Also- their clothes and boutique totally suck. And they're bathrooms are disgusting.

Great food, really good prices! Cream cheese potato soup yes yes!!!!!  I like this location because it has a ton of seating. Usually at other locations it is nearly impossible to find a table, at this location I always find one.  My only complaint is that every time I have come here they only have one cashier working, and usually the line is super long to order.

This place is extremely over priced and underwhelming. I have been here three times now, and I always leave feeling like an idiot for going back. So no more!  On my first visit I had the chicken and dumplings. It was so blah and boring and corn starchy. The vegetables were under cooked and the broth under seasoned. Also, the chicken in it seemed to be more like mystery meat.  The second time I went I just went with the grilled cheese and soup. Pretty blah as well. They don't seem to season any of their food here??? The third time I went reluctantly for a friends birthday party. This time I tried the over-hyped short ribs. Again, blah. Over priced, over reduced sauce, overly fatty small piece of meat, but the green beans with it were delicious! It was funny because the birthday girl got the chicken and dumplings, even though I warned her, and was extremely displeased. She isn't one to send things back, so when our waitress asked her if she liked her food she just shrugged and said 'meh'. The waitress just made a rude face a walked away.  Oh and the bacon wrapped s'mores are seriously gross, and why do they put bacon in everything here??? EVERYTHING.  ps looking over this review I realize how much I really don't like this place. Was two stars, now one.

The pizza is really good. The crust is very thick, so if you're a thin crust lover this wont be the place for you.  Their hot wings are divine!

No. The frozen yogurt tasted like freezer burn. A girl working behind the counter had a cigarette (not lit) in her mouth and was texting. Gross. Go to Mojo

Came here for the first time on Saturday night. My boyfriend and I live right up the street, and had considered eating here for the past few months, so we finally made the 5 minute treck to B&Bs.  I wasn't expecting much, ambiance wise, so there really wasn't a let down there. However, it smelled very "clean" inside. I like cleanliness, and don't want to get sick, but it was a very strong fabreeze/glade plug-in cover-up-something disgusting smelling-smell. I want to smell grease and salty air at a burger place!  We both had the 'Blu Bro' burger, with fries. They were pretty good. The red onion should definately be sliced 4x's thinner, but still, good. Next time I will ask for mine with out mustard, since I apparently don't like a blue cheese/mustard combo. We also shared an order of fried pickles, which were yummy, but boring after 2 or 3.  I am giving four stars because I want to see this place stick around. I will be back.

Wow wow wow!! I can't get enough of Zoe's.  The food here is DIVINE. Completely SUPREME. I love it. My faves: -steak roll ups -chicken roll ups -the slaw -rice pilaf -hummus -they have bomb iced tea.  Plus, you can order and pay for your food online, so if you want to pick it up you literally walk in, are handed your food, and walk out. So easy.  The people who work here are rad too.

Usually when I find something I like at a restaurant, it's the only thing I'll ever order. At NCounter I have to try something different every time, and have yet to be disappointed. My only complaints are that they are on the slow side, yet they always seem to have a ton of asu students working. Would be 5 stars if the wait was less than 15 minutes for a to go sandwich!

I think this place is pretty good, compared to other 'fast' mill ave eateries.  I like the flavor of the tacos, with the feta and garlic sauce stuff. It gives it an almost Greek taste, which I like.   Also, the tacos are super cheap and pretty big.   I can't really compare them to other Mexican food places, because I don't think they're typical 'Mexican', considering I'm an Az native...  All in all, I like them. I think they're unique!

$2 cookie ice cream sandwich is totally a deal! Unfortunately you totally "get what you pay for".  I finally made it in here the other day, and I just wasn't all that impressed. After reading all the reviews, I was expecting the most adorable/amazing ice cream cookie place ever! What I walked into, however, was a kind of grungy store front.  I asked for the m&m cookie and snickerdoodle cookie with vanilla ice cream. After paying I was told to help myself to a spoon and napkins. The cup (or spoon holder/spoon display?) for the spoons had one lonely spoon in it. One! It was dead in there, how long does it take to refill the spoon cup? I thought it was the ice cream-sample-spoon-trash. Ugh, gross I really hope it wasn't. Anyway! My cookie sandwich had the tiniest scoop of ice cream on it, which tasted fine (I've had Dreyers a time or two). The cookies were pretty good, although the selection was seriously lacking when I went in there (around 4). My m&m cookie had 4 m&m's in it. Really, it did! I'm not just trying to be a snobby bitch, I swear! So, $2 dollars in exchange for an ice cream sandwich is a good deal. But like I said, you get what you pay for, and in this case it aint much. I'll keep going to Cookiez for my gigantic 1/2 ice cream sandwich that costs maybe $3, but has homemade ice cream, and ample amounts of spoons! (Cookiez on mill is pretty grungy, too, I know!)

Just got back from my spray tan at The Bronze Bar. Laura was extremely friendly, laid back, and professional. She made me feel so comfortable, and was fun to talk to. She was very thorough with our consultation, making sure she chose a good color for my pasty skin. She also listened to what I like and don't like, and wanted to make sure I was totally happy with the results.  Even though my actual tan hasn't fully developed yet, I have a feeling it will be great. Also, when I've be sprayed before I usually feel like a hot sticky mess, and am too embarrassed to go anywhere/ do anything for the rest of the day. Laura dusts this awesome powder on your skin after the tan to make you feel like a normal person. I also don't smell like that nasty spray tan smell which is such a relief. She was very concerned with my tan turning out perfect, and with me being satisfied with it. I can tell she really cares about her guests, and as a hair stylist I can relate to that.  I will recommend The Bronze Bar to everyone!

Yum! I like bulk, unwrapped candy. I don't care if it seems 'unclean'. Obviously if a bunch of candy is stuck together I will change my mind, but all the candy I got here was neither sticky, or in any child's mouth (from what I observed). The prices are high, but it's a novelty shop, not Circle K. I like that I can mix and match my own variety of candy. Also, the unwrapped bulk candy I purchased was absolutely fresh, and tasty. The man working at the cash register was super friendly. I love candy, and I will be back!

Lots of equipment. Super cheap memberships- and the trainers/staff don't bother you at all, which is nice. I can fiddle around with a weight machine like an idiot for 5 minutes without anyone giving me dirty looks- which is awesome.  Even at peak hours this location still isn't too crazy! Lots of open machines. My only complaint are the lame-o's that just want to post on a piece of equipment for like 15 minutes. You do not need that much time to cool down from your reps! GTFO!

I had Umami for the first time today. I had my friends from work send me a screen shot of the menu, and then I ordered from there and they brought it back to work for me. I am not sure which broth I had because I told my coworker to just get me "the best one" and it really was delicious. Super rich, salty and velvety. I added the roasted pork and a hard boiled egg to it. I really enjoyed my lunch, and they packed it really well for take out, with the noodles in a different container than the broth so they wouldn't get mushy. I ate about half of it, and was super full. I put the rest in the fridge, and then re heated it about 3-4 hours later, afraid that the noodles were going to absorb all the broth and become gigantic and mushy. But no, they were still perfect. I can't wait to come eat here more often as soon as the weather cools down. I think this will be a weekly lunch spot! A very satisfying meal

We have been to Bei twice now, and I have to say I hope this little sushi place stays around. The food has been really good on both visits, and I love that they offer a reverse happy hour, as my work schedule doesn't usually allow me to go to normal happy hour. The tuna lovers roll is amazing. Probably my favorite roll I have ever had anywhere! The sashimi prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay at a sushi restaurant. That's my only issue with Bei. The food is great, but the location and decorating/ ambiance of the restaurant aren't the best. The bar area is really dark- yet the dining room is extremely bright. I wish they could dim the lights a little more to give it a better vibe. I don't mind paying higher prices for quality sushi, but not when it's in a run down strip mall with tacky decorating. But we will return! And I probably just sounded super bitchy! Go here! Just don't expect a romantic setting of any sort!   Oh and they have a good selection of appetizers! Yum!

It's true. This is the worst chipotle ever. It's small, my tortilla was stale and chewy, the black beans were undercooked. The soda machine was broken, and when I told a staff member walking by he just shrugged his shoulders haha whaaa?? It was also disgustingly dirty at the drink/utensil station, showing it had been neglected for quite a while. My food was beyond cold by the time I got home (5 minute drive). Never again.

Good location for tempe marketplace. Far away from all the craziness and traffic aka much easier to get to than bevmo. Other than that it's your typical total wine. The second I walked in a staff member asked me if he could help me find something, and when they didn't have what I was looking for he redirected me to something similar. He knew what he was talking about, and even gave me a little lesson in champagne- Rose to be exact.

I'm so glad Pho Cao is reopened- and closer to my house! Food is as great as before, service is better than before. Couldn't be happier! Well, unless they got their website and online ordering back up and running. But still- 5 stars!

I'm so done with this place. First time we came here (around opening day) food was awesome. Second time food/service were awful. Went again recently and: $15 for fried chicken entree which was 1/2 of one chicken cutlet, with an ear or corn, and dried out brussel sprouts sprinkled with dry bacon. The brussel sprouts really made no sense, no flavor or even olive oil to make them palatable, but the fact that a $15 entree couldn't even come with a full breast of chicken? Most places gives you at least 1/2 a chicken when you order fried chicken. Total rip off and just so cheap and skimpy on behalf of the restaurant. Ordered the mac n cheese, which was amazing on our first visit. What we got this time was a watered down soupy mess that tasted like beer and nothing else. So disgusting and unappetizing- we asked our server to take it off the bill- which when asked they acted like they already knew it was bad. A quick "I'm so sorry I'll take it off the bill right away" before I could even explain what was wrong with it.  The second time we came here I figured it was just them working out the new restaurant kinks. Now they've been open for long enough to know what they're doing, and they're doing a terrible job. Such a bummer.

I was so excited for this place to open, and it does not disappoint! I went for lunch today around 11:30 and it was pretty empty when I walked in but by the time I left 5 minutes later the line was getting long.  I got a regular sized bowl (which was plenty of food) with white rice, avocado, tuna, spicy tuna, spicy house sauce, green onions, ginger, sprouts, cucumbers, crispy onions and sesame seeds. The price was not bad at all, about $9. It was so good I can't wait to go back!
