I've been to a couple Native locations before, and I've got to say: the Tempe location in particular is so DARK. Seriously, it makes it hard to read the menu and to see the faces of the people you're with. It doesn't feel as warm as the ones in Ahwatukee (to me, anyway), but it's clean, which is always important to me.  That said, you can't go wrong with the wings. I've had other items from the menu before (pizza, burgers, etc) and they're nothing exceptional. But if I'm in the mood for wings, Native is my go-to place. I just wish that they still provided moist towelettes for my saucy post-wing fingers...  Technically, I would give this particular location a 3.5, but half stars aren't allowed so I rounded up. For the record, I'd give the Ahwatukee locations 4 for better atmosphere.

I've been going here with my family ever since we moved to Arizona when I was a kid. It's always had a really laid back atmosphere.  We always get the pork tacos and quesadillas (which we load up with salad/slaw stuff from the free salad bar). I LOVE the pork tacos. They're street taco style so they're small, but I have never tasted another taco like the pork tacos at Guedo's. Maybe they just seem magical to me because of my childhood memories of them, but seriously. They're good.

I love the girls over at Grooming Humans! Everyone is super nice and friendly, and that's saying something because I'm usually intimidated by salons.  The first time I went, I had Holli give me an all-over color. The second time, I had Kate put in some low-lights to hide my roots as well as a cut. Both of them did great jobs, and didn't mind accommodating me when I was worried about the hair dye getting on my new ear piercings (just ask them to put a bandage or something over it; they'll also be careful around that area).  Before I went to Grooming Humans, I was a $20 haircut type of girl--but I can really tell that difference in quality between a $20 cut and a cut from Grooming Humans... and I'm addicted! My hair looks tons better after they're done with it. Plus, it's literally across the street from ASU's Tempe campus! Score!

Service: Good, very quick at refilling chips as soon as you get low. Chips and salsa were actually already set at the table for us when we were seated, which was nice.  Food: Fish tacos were bland. Quesadillas are extremely lacking. Don't bother with them as you can get a better one literally anywhere else. Guacamole looks like runny green poo. Other items I've tried tasted pretty standard - not stand out or especially delicious, but edible.  Ambience: Large restaurant, always somewhat busy for lunch. Feels a bit dingy though.  Verdict: Mediocre. If you're not set on Mexican food I would suggest going next door to Cornish Pasty Co instead.

If you want: 1) you want a simple manicure 2) you want it quick 3) you want it cheap  Then I highly recommend Uni Hair and Nail Salon, because they do all these things in a clean and spacious environment. Their location close to campus also makes them super convenient. I've gone to get a full set of french tips and both times I was very happy with the quality and the price. The staff here is nice and makes everything hassle free.  That said, I got my first pedi there today and I personally wouldn't come back to them for another, just because my feet didn't seem much improved afterward. I was hoping they'd get rid of some calluses but they didn't... so I took a PedEgg to these calluses after my visit and was able to get rid of them without a lot of effort. Knowing that, I feel that they could have tried harder and done a better job on my feet. But if your feet are in nice condition to begin with, I guess they do a decent pedicure--just nothing exceptional.

I am really uncoordinated, not very flexible, have a slow reaction time, and since I was a kid, I hated physical activity. That said, I decided on a bit of a whim one day that I wanted to take up kickboxing. (I figured that it would help me improve all of the aforementioned weaknesses--and it has. But I'm getting ahead of myself.) So I hopped on Google and Yelp and found out about Irongloves, which is quite close to ASU. It took me a couple days to muster up the courage to call for a trial lesson, but when I finally did Renene was very nice and accommodating. I went in for my first lesson that same day.  One of the big things that Irongloves emphasizes on its website is that it makes boxing for everyone. And I've found this to be completely true. I was afraid that it would be intimidating, but when I got there those fears were dispelled. All kinds of people train at Irongloves, NOT just pros. NOT just men. NOT just young people. NOT just super fit people. Everyone!  Now for my personal opinion: I'm a little obsessed with boxing now. Yes, me, who hated PE in elementary school! I think it has a lot to do with the people at Irongloves. Everyone is friendly, positive, and willing to help each other out. The owners, Joe and Renene, are always there to help you as well, and they will build a relationship with you (which you can't say for a lot of other places these days)! They also won't pressure you into joining (there are no membership contracts) and will accommodate you if you have to cancel or reschedule, given that you give them proper notice.  I train with Tony, and we started out with the very basics. He's patient but he really pushes you. Don't expect him to let you go easy. Plus, he's just a lot of fun to work with! I like having someone who holds me accountable and doesn't let me give up. And of course, kickboxing and boxing are great workouts. My arms have definitely toned up and I'm starting to see that coveted definition in my abs.  (And at the time of writing this, I've had 9 lessons.)  If you're a complete beginner like me, I highly recommend the 1-on-1 training, because your coach will be able to correct your technique and stance, whereas in a class there might be too many people for individualized attention like that. (Though they do offer group classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.) At Irongloves, you train with your coach for 30 minutes and then work on a set of whiteboard exercises that change weekly. The price for 1-on-1 is quite reasonable considering that it's personal training.  To sum up: Irongloves is awesome, don't be afraid to check it out!

HTC is the only place I would trust with any piercing more complicated than a lobe piercing. I've gotten 3 cartilage piercings done there, two of which needed to be replaced with a longer barbell a month in due to swelling (Unfortunately my cartilage is prone to swelling. It wasn't any fault of the piercing job). The staff at HTC took care of them for me without charge. Both the piercers and the front desk staff were extremely helpful and patient, even when I call them only hours after leaving the store with a silly paranoid question.  The whole process is done very professionally in a clean environment. They make sure you're well informed before they pierce you and always make sure you're okay after it's done. :)

What kind of business doesn't hire enough people to be able to properly service a half empty restaurant? Today we sat at a table for 40 minutes and didn't get even get to put in an order before we decided to just leave. Last time I was here the cook had to come out to help us because the one waitress who works there was so overwhelmed. It's a shame this place is so understaffed because I've been here before and the food is decent.   Unless they hire more people I wouldn't recommend coming here. They can only handle two parties in the restaurant at a time.

Even though it is an Americanized chain restaurant, I really like Kabuki when I'm in the mood for sushi but don't want to venture too far.  The service is always fast and you usually get seated right away.  The menu is awesome in terms of variety - you'll even find some Japanese food that you wouldn't typically find, like ochazuke and onigiri (though these items are a bit expensive, I appreciate the fact that they are  offered at all). The drink menu does not leave you wanting, either.  The food is always good, though admittedly the fish is not the freshest I've had. Then again, I have come to expect that in Arizona.  The atmosphere is great too - good for catching up with a friend or in a big group.

This place has a cute selection and is pretty affordable compared to the other meager shopping options currently on Mill, but if I'm in the mood to shop Pitaya wouldn't be one of my first choices. Maybe it was because I visited during the middle of a weekday, but I got the vibe that the salesgirl wished I would leave, because she was talking to a friend when I came in and I guess that my presence made her feel the need to talk in whispers. And when she did help me, she seemed annoyed about it.  I did end up buying a couple of things from there, only to find the SAME EXACT SKIRT for maybe $8 cheaper at LoveCulture in Scottsdale Mall. I kid you not. If I can get the same clothes for cheaper elsewhere, then I don't think I'll be going back.

All the food here is reheated right in front of you. However, I would be able to overlook that if the food tasted decent. I love pasta and don't know how you can go wrong with baked ziti, but somehow they did. It was bland and the noodles were overcooked. Terrible.

First things first: Yelp says this place is only open on Saturdays - it's definitely not true and hopefully it gets fixed soon. They're open everyday.  I go here weekly to grab lunch during work - I have yet to be disappointed. The chicken is always flavorful and I've never found it to be dry. The gyro is also on point and is served extremely fast!  In terms of price, if you get a plate combo then you can expect to pay about $12-$13.... But you get A LOT of food. It comes with tons of rice, pita with dipping sauce, a side salad, and a generous amount of whatever meat option your heart desires. I always have to take leftovers home when I order a plate. IMO, definitely not expensive considering all that you get.  Alternatively, you can get a value meal which consists of a pita sandwich with fries and a drink - typically about $10. The pita sandwich is nicely stuffed so I also can't complain about the price for those. Also, their fries are awesome - nothing special, just perfectly crisp on the outside and thick and "meaty" inside. Mmmm.  The only thing I would probably pass on are the salad entrées, just because I feel that there's almost TOO much vinaigrette on them. I tend to like my salads dry though, so I might just be an oddball in that regard.

Love it! Finally a nice place to hang out in the Foothills, only minutes from my home! The coffee and prices are good, and the atmosphere is relaxing. Not too loud, but also not too quiet. We played mancala, which is one of the small collection of games they provide. I only wish that it was open in the evenings! (Their summer hours close at 5pm.)  Overall, I can definitely see myself coming back here to chat with friends or to get some work done!

I don't think this place is deserving of the 4 stars that it has. Went in for lunch on a weekday around 11:30 and found the employees just sitting around doing nothing. We were the first customers of the day, but it seemed like they hadn't even bothered doing any kind of set-up until we ordered.  The cashier seemed to have no idea what she was doing. We watched the cook methodically heat a piece of chicken for a "grilled" chicken sandwich (Chipotle Chicken Club) in a toaster oven reminiscent of Subway. But at least Subway is fast - it took forever to get our food and it was not very good.  We were the only people in the place even when it hit peak lunch hour - only one other person came in and we watched her stand at the counter for 5 minutes because both the staff had gone into the backroom and didn't bother coming back out.  Perhaps this place is better during the weekend... but I won't be back.

Found out about The Revival after sifting through 17 pages of the same old Yelp results looking for a place for lunch - I live and work in Tempe and am running out of new places to eat, so I was stoked to find out that this place had opened just a few weeks ago. As soon as I read about the chef's association House of Tricks, I knew I had to go.  We got there around 11:40, which was perfect because it was right before the lunch rush started rolling in. Being a new restaurant, I wasn't sure if it would be busy, but it was once it hit noon. Clearly the word is spreading fast!  Everything on the menu looked amazing, but I decided to start by trying the Charred Korean Pork Belly sandwich, which was great. The flavors actually reminded me more of Banh Mi than Korean food, but being Vietnamese I can't complain. :)  The atmosphere was casual and relaxed. A great place for lunch, but I can also see myself coming here to unwind for dinner and drinks during happy hour.  Basically, I just left and I already can't wait to go back! It's definitely a place I can see myself frequenting in the future.

This is the go-to place in Tempe if you want a laid back place to eat & drink, while avoiding the college-y Mill Ave vibe.  The soft pretzel balls with cheese fondue are a MUST. Everyone I know raves about how they could drink the cheese because it is just that delicious.  Other items on the menu that I would recommend are the pub burger and the sweet corn cannelloni. The one thing I would not recommend is the ramen - it was pretty bland, didn't have shrimp as advertised, and when I asked for Sriracha to jazz it up, I never received any. That was probably more of a miss on my server's part though.  There is tons of space for activities, so it is GREAT for large groups. But heads up: if you go to the back area near where the games are you can only order from a limited food menu.
