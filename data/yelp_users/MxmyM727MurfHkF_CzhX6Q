Every time we go to Nakama we have a great experience. The Sushi rolls are amazing and unique. My favorite is the Marilyn Monroll and the Gila Monster. We just saw them light a roll on fire the other day and it was pretty awesome. We asked the server and they said the roll is called the lotus roll.

Friendly and quick. I would have liked a longer massage, but still a good amount of time considering it was a Saturday and it was busy.

Great food! We tried the steak and mushroom skewers, the patatas bravos, the shrimp ceviche, the sliders, and the stuffed dates. All were good and surprisingly the dates were our favorite. Also, the best service we have had over the 6 days we were in Vegas!

The service was good. Promptly to the table. Our order came out quickly and was cooked to order. The food was all very bland for burgers. Even the onion rings had very little flavor. Maybe we ended up on an off day or with a new cook?

The staff was friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is open and fun. The food was terrific, we tried the Baker pizza and it was amazing! For dessert we crushed a delicious pizza cookie with gelato. Truly the best pizza cookie we have had. They have drink specials and a good variety of beer. The only downside is Pepsi products, but if you drink beer and cider you won't even notice
