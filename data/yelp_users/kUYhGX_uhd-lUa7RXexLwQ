Well, I don't get annoyed easily. Walked in for a place to watch the 2015 World Series & an absolutely awful band was playing loudly. There was no host to find us a seat, so we sat down ourselves. We waited 20min with no service. We decided to go to the bar. We were served quickly, however the bartender (Julie) was rude as hell. I will not be coming back. Terrible place.

Decent sandwhiches. Ordered the number 22 with no cheese. They didn't put the sauce on it, that should have been. It a was a tad dry. The coffee was good, however it was almost as expensive as the sandwhich. 3 stars  To make it even worse, the owner came up trying to beg us to correct the issue. As we were walking out, the cooks and cashier starred us down. Wont be coming back here. As a professional yelper, zookz has failed.

I am a HUGE baseball fan! This is the place to be if you're a fan of the sport. Set aside from baseball, the food is absolutely amazing! I had the tostadas and my father had the carne street tacos. Both were awesome! The guac is on point!! Servers are great and friendly and the atmosphere overall is 5 stars. This is a must go to!
