I took my girlfriend here for our first Valentine's Day together. I was looking for my "Lady and the Tramp meatball moment."   Instead, I came away underwhelmed.   I believe much of my issues stem from the prix fixe menu that was available, but there were other problems as well.   The service was average at best. I forget our servers name, but she rattled off the entrees, brought us our bread, and then expected us to order. We were both a little shocked. Personally, I felt rushed all evening and I had to work against the servers to slow the evening down.   The ambience was less than ideal. Italian music played oh-so-faintly in the background. The lights were up all the way. No candles on any of the tables. We at least got the wine glasses promptly (though the provided wine key had a really loose hinge), though our wine was so-so (a custom labeled zinfandel I had got from a different place. Great label, average wine).   These issues were important to setting the mood for the evening, but we still had to eat. I had high expectations for the food, especially given the large number of very positive reviews from other Yelpers. However, the food did not live up to expectations.   The gnocchi I ordered was pillowy soft, exactly the way it's supposed to be, with wonderfully flavorful sauce. Alli's dish, a chicken piccata, was long on chicken, short of pasta, and the lemon sauce was only okay. In short, the presentation needed work.   Again, I think the problems with the food stemmed from the prix fixe menu. Under normal circumstances, I'm sure Ristorante Guiseppe serves wonderful, authentic, full-blooded Italian food, but this time, the experience felt rushed, cheap, and quick. In summation: not the Valentine's Day ambience one is trying to create.  I am very willing to give it another shot, but I would not recommend Ristorante Guiseppe for a special occasion.

Inventive dishes, but the portions are too big to justify their motto of 'the art of healthy eating.'   The service is average. On a busy night, try to order everything at once otherwise you will be at the table for a long time.   Always try a special. They are almost always excellent.   The hummus is excellent. We get it everytime, automatically.   PJ is a great spot for a date or a casual dinner. Be sure to get your order in promptly, otherwise you'll be at the table for awhile. Drinks are available, but are not set at world-beater prices.   Insider tip: try Pita Jungle for breakfast! They make a great egg pita sandwich!!! (Coffee is average, btw)

I was experiencing all manner of pain in my knees - it hurt to walk at times, let alone run or go about my normal activity. This worried me because I'm 23 years old and I was having the symptoms of someone twice my age. I saw a knee specialist and he recommended me to Dr. Amit Sahasrabudhe, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Amit then referred me to Endurance Rehab.   This was the second rehab center I was referred to. The first, Physiotherapy Associates in Tempe were awful. After diagnosing my problem (incorrectly, it turns out), they figured I could handle the exercises myself and pretty much let me be. Small wonder I didn't get better!   Totally the opposite at Endurance Rehab. First of all, they correctly diagnosed my issue: it wasn't my knees, it was my hips and IT bands. My therapist Mike DoVico created an individual workout plan for me and lead me through each exercise. Even when I was handed off to some of the other PTs, they each did an excellent job taking care of me and showing me exactly how to do each new exercise, as well, perhaps most importantly, keeping me on track.   Long story short: I can now run, lift, and be as active as I want - and should - be at 23. The staff and Endurance Rehab gave me back my physical ability, which is a gift that cannot be understated.   I fully endorse Endurance Rehab and will recommend Mike and his staff to anyone I know who needs to get back on their feet.

Don't let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience.   My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendre's on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter's advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate.   I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon.   We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all.   Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you won't come away disappointed!

I don't get the hype for this place.   The sandwiches are cheap, sure, but what do you get? Couple slices of deli meat crushed between two thick loaves of puffy sub bread. When I want a sub, I'm there for the meat - not the bread.   Is it better than Subway? Yes. But most places are better than Scrubway.   Potbelly's is Jimmy John's subs with a toaster oven.   Cafe Rio next door is far, far better and only a few dollars more.
