I've been taking my puppy to this place for over 7 months now.  I spent a lot of time researching options before choosing them and am so happy with my choice!  We typically see Dr Jennifer Johnson and she is kind, funny and smart.  We also saw Dr MacKenzie once and he was great, too.  Plus, each person on their staff, from the assistants to the front desk, has been helpful and nice.  Love everything about them :)

This review is only for the club room upstairs as I haven't been to any other areas of the club. The main reason I went here - they have 2 poles you can dance on! They're only 3/4 height poles so they aren't the most stable, but for doing basic pole tricks and bends it'll work! Both poles are elevated on platforms so you can shake your thang for everyone to see.

This place has my favorite food in the Phoenix area.  And, if you like grilled meats, hummus and rice you will love it, too.  Disclaimer: I'm not a connoisseur of the depth of traditional Persian foods - I'm just a regular girl who loves her meats, veggies and rice.   If it's your first time I HAVE to recommend you try the Barg - beef or chicken, they are both amazing.  The meats are tender and full of flavor.  The hummus here is one of my very favorites and the dipping bread they make on-site is perfect - even whole grain recently.  As for the rice, if you like tartness (think cranberries with a twist) I recommend upgrading your rice on the dish to the Zereshk - it's amazing.  The little red spice they offer on the table (Sumac) has a very slight lemon flavor and accents both the meat and the rice wonderfully.  I also sometimes order the koobideh - think meatloaf with lots of flavor.  I've not liked that in many Persian places but here is it very good.  The only hazard I have for you is that the portions are huge, so plan to have leftovers.  Highly recommended!

I was here for their monthly girls night and it looked like so much fun! I didn't get to partake in any of the festivities since I was teaching pole dance tricks, but the bar had free champagne from 9-11, a chocolate fountain with strawberries and bananas, free gifts in a raffle for various local businesses and $3.00 drinks all night. They have a pole installed in the back with seats all around so you can get your pole on with your friends!  The place is pretty small, but cozy and the staff were so friendly.  They had great music playing that you could dance to and the burger I had was great!

After reading the reviews for this place I was really looking forward to trying it.  I did - and I won't be back.  First impressions weren't great - it's rather dingy and dirty plus the restrooms really needed a cleaning.  It even smells funny.  I tried the vegetable tempura and was quite underwhelmed - no flavor and the provided dipping sauce wasn't great.  I tried a side salad - didn't like their take on dressing.  Then, a few of the more 'conservative' rolls.  I can't say they were horrible but I also can't say they were good.  I even ordered a side of chicken fried rice and found it not good, either.    I'm guessing that for people who are really into authentic Japanese food or raw sushi this place hits the mark.  However, if you are like me and more of a causal sushi eater then I don't recommend it.

I was so happy when I saw this chain appear in AZ.  I used to frequent it in CA and have never found another sub that comes close.    I think the secret to their success lies in the freshness and quality of their meats and cheeses - always sliced to order.  If you are looking for a veggie sandwich - you will be limited here.  But, if you like a hearty cheesesteak or italian sub you are in for a treat.  They also take a bit of a different approach in that they really douse their sandwiches in oil & vinegar.   It is a different approach but seriously good!  The "Mike's Way" option (lettuce, onions & tomatoes) is a bit bland, I love to add the mustard, mayo & pepperocini.  Their signature sandwich is the #13.  It has several flavorful italian meats plus freshly sliced cheese.  Don't judge this place until you have tried that sandwich!  It is unlike any other chain's offering & really amazing.    Their sandwich sizes are a bit different from the regular foot-long, but if you order the largest size you are getting quite a bit for your money.  I've visited the one that just opened in Chandler and was completely pleased.  And, I'm happy to hear they are now opening one in Ahwatukee.  They also seem to have a high focus on customer service - I've always been met by very cheerful, helpful people.  Not a necessity for a sandwich, but certainly a lot better than the opposite.

I love this place! They have a few poles strategically placed around the club...some for public viewing and others that are a little more shielded from public view if you want to dance in a more "private" setting in the VIP tent area.   The drinks are reasonably priced, the DJ played some great music, and overall this place is good for a night out.

This place is really good.  And, it's a great value.  My favorite item so far is their salad - the one they serve with the meal.  It's beyond delicious.  I tried their namesake dish (the Baked RigaTony) and it was just OK.  But, everything else I've had there was wonderful.

Now having gone many, many times I have to recommend their ravioli - it's homemade pasta (yum!) and top notch cheeses.  I LOVE their sauce that is tomato + cream, it would seriously made an amazing soup but also blends perfectly with the ravioli.  Try it!  That plus a salad is a perfect dinner.  Plus, I don't really care for their bread which is perfect since that way I don't eat any!  ;)  (the ladies will get it...)  My husband also loves the chicken parm.

I am so very pleased with the quality of both the customer service and the work of Clearly Clean Carpets.  Friendly, professional, honest, thorough and well-priced - what more could you ask for?  I'll be a loyal customer for a long time to come.

I really wanted to like this place.  I like to give new places and unique concepts support. I love seeing people try to make a go of something they are passionate about and always hope for their success.    On the bright side, our server was friendly and accommodating.  But, on the not so bright side, the ambiance was confusing and the food was not great.  I ordered a chicken dish they suggested as a top seller and found it so salty it was hard to eat.  The French onion soup was just OK, and the spinach dip was also odd.  I will say there was one thing I loved - the bread they serve was super tasty.    Obviously the food needs help if they are going to be successful, but I also think that they need to clarify who there are in order to draw a sustainable crowd (it was crazy slow there when I went on a Friday around 7).  From the name, menu and 3/4 of the décor I'd expect a fun, old school experience.  If they went with that identity I'd imagine they could get a following from the local swing dance crowds plus others looking for a fun reason to dress up and go out on the weekend.  But, they are pretty obviously trying to do something country there, too ~ some country décor, country dance, country bands... it just ends up feeling confused.  I'm not sure the mix of everything ends up making it comfortable enough to either crowd.  Just my opinion, but if they picked a direction and went down it perhaps they could create something outstanding.  I do wish them the best. :)

I have had the pleasure of working with Tom at SDR for years.  I first hired him as the GC for a mid-sized commercial remodel back in 2008. I was ever impressed by his fair pricing, reliability and timeliness.  Let's face it, a lot can go wrong and contractors don't have the greatest reputation for staying on time and budget.  But, with Tom I've always been super pleased on every front.  Since I first found him online I've worked with him for a second remodel as well as a handful of other projects (various repairs, etc).  I can confidently say that I highly recommend Tom as a general contractor.

Oh wow - I am so happy I found Living Spaces.  They have a great selection of mid level furniture (not as nice as name brands but not like Target stuff, either) at REALLY good prices.  Plus, their sales people are super friendly & helpful but also not commission based so it's way less intense than most furniture stores.    I had so much fun I dragged my sister around for hours as I got a dining room set, pieces for my home office and a sectional.  Jason and LaLa were a ton of fun and very helpful.  There were people to help everywhere in case you need something, like I said, very helpful but not pushy.  Even their management was spot on with excellent customer service.  I think one of the most amazing things to me was that on the couches, etc you can pick your own fabric... for the same awesome price as the regular in-stock one... and it's going to get to you in just a few weeks!  Pair that with their one-fee-for-everything delivery + set up (haha... I got more than my money worth on that part!) and I really couldn't be happier.  The delivery people were fast, friendly and professional.    Seriously. Love. This. Place.  Will be back!

As a regular to Tempe Square I had heard a lot of good things about this new place.  I stopped in today for my first pedi and absolutely loved it.  Not only is the place ADORABLE - very pretty décor - but the people are awesome.  The pedicure was also top notch.  Since I spend pretty much all my time barefoot let's just say I (and my husband) ;) really appreciate a callous removal done right.  These guys have those magical grater thingies that many salons don't for a comfortable and very effective job well done.  Did I mention the place is also super cute?  That's a nice bonus to us girls.  Try them out and you'll see what I mean.  You really don't need any more reason to support a business with top notch customer service, great prices and excellent treatments, but by going here you are also helping a girl with a dream to own her own biz be successful.  The owner is super smart, sweet and friendly and her team (I'm looking at you, Kevin) follows suit.  So do it - get polished up pretty!
