Hands down, this place has the BEST sandwiches in AZ!  1. Great Bread 2. Generous size portion of meat in each sandwich. 3. Nice variety of sandwiches.  Wild Turkey is my personal favorite sandwich. Brie/ Boar's Head Turkey/ Lettuce/ Tomato on Sourdough Bread.

The area is a little sketchy but the restaurant is very nice, they have a great selection of tequila and margaritas. The food is decent but what I liked most is that when you order the guacamole a guy comes out and makes it from scratch in front of you.   I would go back..

1. Awesome location. 2. Fantastic Food. 3. Great environment.  Only reason to not give it 5 stars is because the wait time is so long but this place is a must go.

You think Pizzeria Bianco is the best? This place is at least even or better and you don't have to wait 3 HOURS to be seated.   Only Pros : Large seating area/ Nice bar area/ Great simple drink menu/ The BEST brick oven pizza with homemade dough! / Great Ceviche/  Perfect place to go with a group of friends or a date/ FREE VALET/ One of the best drinks ever "SHAKIN' LEMONADE"   This place should be Bookmarked!! TRY IT

Very low key and dark vibe, not group friendly and very small. The beer selection was very basic but a nice selection. I wouldn't recommended this place to anyone just because it's a little creepy to take a date or friends. I had high hopes for this place but now that I've tried it, I'm not a fan.

Just went for the first time on Saturday night and it was overall a great experience, I like the vibe and the service was excellent. As far as the food goes, it was fantastic! I started with some Bruschetta and would have to say my favorite was the goat cheese. I ordered the sicily pizza and the bread was amazing on it, it also had some goat cheese as well. I would recomend trying this place at least once, I wasn't the biggest fan of goat cheese but now I am.

Worst Nightclub ever, let me tell you about my experience...   First of all its way to expensive ($40) to get in the club and the line is too long. Its too packed inside and the drinks are expensive. To top everything, the bouncers get power hungry and push people out of the way for no reason. I would strongly recommend that you will never come here.

Great spot on a Friday after work to grab a drink with friends or co workers, this place is "Light Rail Friendly" which means if you want to do a little bar hoping after a few drinks then you don't need to drive to the next bar. When I want to show off uptown phx, I bring friends to this place and everyone always enjoys this place. The happy hr is decent but the real deal is when you get a volcano bowl or spider bowl and share with a group of people. I just love the ambiance of this place and how great it is for groups of any size. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because the service could be super slow and the waiters tend to forget about you. But overall I am a fan and I will be back for more good memories!

Best tacos in phoenix!  1. Simple Menu 2. Great flavors in the carne asada. 3. Ceviche is great. 4. Horchata is fantastic!  p.s. If you want to catch a game the location on 7th ave has a TV.

Convenient when on the go! This location is right off the I-17 and Thomas and easy to get in but not easy to get out which is the reason why I didn't rate it at 5 stars.  Outdoor only, nice patio seating.

This past weekend I went to The Vig Uptown twice because it was that  good. This is a perfect place to hangout with friends and get a bite to eat with a really great drink menu. What I love most about this place is that it is very modern and the people are pretty chill. The cherry on top is the games they have to offer, Bocce and Bags!  Drinks 1. Moscow Mule is a perfect nice refreshing drink to order, made with Vodka/Ginger beer and fresh lime juice.  2. If you bring in your own "pimp cup" any size, They will fill it up with the mixed drink called Pimms Cup.  Food 1. VigAzz burger is my favorite food item to order because the pretzel bread is amazing. 2. Thai spicy Vings here are probably one of my favorite wings that i've ever had so I highly recommend getting them.
