Drove here Saturday night craving MEAT!!!@! my best friend and i had our wallets ready to feast like queens :D i ordered the 16 oz prime rib with sauteed mushrooms and a glass of red wine. my bestie ordered the porterhouse and a coke.   16 oz prime rib ($25): i ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. it was ammmazzing!! it was tender, very juicy, the cut was 3/4 of an inch. the prime rib was slightly seasoned and it was perfect.   Porterhouse ($30): it was cooked at Medium. My bestie gave me the parts where the fat was on the steak.. she passed that part over to me so i had a taste LOL at medium it was a bit dry. the steak was boned in. it was kinda bland but hey!!... its not my meal so bleh...as long as mine was bombay.. i dont care LOL.   Wine ($6): not sure what i got cz i asked the watiress to surprise me LOL it was good tho  Coke(?): oh man... it tasted sweet and bubbly... it was pretty darn good cup of coke LOL  Service (priceless): they were very attentive, kept coming back to check up on us. they were so polite O_O never had that great of a service in cali -_- come on.. LOL do i really have to drive to arizona for good service now? LOL

I never want to go back to the room after the club so I love to go to Drai's after hours. The old location is being renovated but the temporary location at Bally's has the same decor. There's 2 rooms to choose from hip hop or edm so I never get bored. Girl guestlist is the best if you know the right people.

soo.. AFTER the long 6 hr drive to Arizona... i Came here during my Vacation . Got the Lamb shank. it was pretty good. not as great as Kerostena but it was pretty good for a spot in Arizona. the rice it came with was drenched in a tango sweet tomato sauce. portion was pretty decent it. Rice was kinda soupy with too much tomato sauce. The lamb shank was decent portion. wished it had more flavor.  they gave us free soup and since it was my friends brithday they gave her a free dessert. it was sweet of them. They also had a salad all you can eat bar for $12 which the waitress did not mention =/ i was starving too.. she could have wheeled me in that plus the $15 plate of lamb shank =/ oh well LOL. i feasted like a beast from hungry and dehydration. The smoothies there are made from real berries cz i swallowed a few chunks of strawberries and nearly choked LOL but it was worth it. at least i know it wasd fresh right? =] LOL   sorry guys. i had to take 1 star off cz no one told us about the salad buffet and we were super hungry =/

I LOVE THIS HOTEL!!!! it was very clean! im really picky with rooms and set ups. the bathroom was super clean. i had bubble baths in there every night while my best friend went down stairs to gamble LOL they have an ipod dock for u to play music. they also have a 27 inch lg tv in there and etc. first thing i did when i got to the room was run and jump onto the bed ^_^ the bed was very comfortable. most places give u cheap pillows. they gave each bed 5 memory foam pillows. gahh... my best friend and i are both light sleepers.. we slept thru each others convos on the phone LOL. room service came every morning to clean our room around 10am. they dont misplace our stuff like other places did. they just clean up and put our stuff in a convenient spot where we still can find it. i left my itouch on the dock by accident and it was not stolen..so therefore u can trust these people. the busboys and valet guys were SUPER nice. they didnt mind carrying up our stuff or carrying things out for us. =]   the bar in between the customer service area and the casino.. was cool. Joey was very attentive and nice. he made me 2 random ass drinks. i told him to surprise me (since i can hold my alcohol VERY VERY well) the drinks he made were sooo yummy. he definately deserve a raise. i will be asking for joey to make my drinks the next time im in town =]

First day in Arizona.. 1 hr after checking in our hotel at Wild Horse Pass hotel and casino.. we decided to try out this asian spot. it was pretty good.. but not as good as the asian spots in Cali where most asians lived. the food was a bit too salty. the lemonade drink thing i got was too bitter. wished it was a bit sweeter. my bestie and i ordered the Pad Thai and Filet mignon dish.. both were a bit salty. the Pad thai was drowning in msg and sauce. it was a bit too much for me =/  Service was great tho!!! the asian man who was our waiter was very attentive and hooked us up.   next time i wanna try their Sliders. the burgers looked HUGE O_O
