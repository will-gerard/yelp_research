Oh god.. I use to love this place its the closest store to me, and I have my safeway card so I'm good to go.. place is a mess.   First the parking lot.. too small for the amount of things going on at this complex, I am shocked that there isn't a daily accident in the parking lot. People are impatient, driving down the middle of the rows instead of one sides.. I just got back from there and I was making my exit and three cars tried to go for my parking spot created a jumble mess, so much so I had to pull back in the spot so they could move.. ugh.   Inside the story, they seem to always always be stocking and never seem to be stocked.. When I go I can never fully complete my shopping list, there is always something not stocked so I have to come back or just go with out it.. But today took the cake.. Its just after one in the afternoon, every single row there was at least one person stock, blocking half of the row.. its 1pm! Usually by 1, stores are stocked up, maybe one or two things to go..   There was also a cockroach.. and not to sound snobby but the type of people that tend to go to this on, I feel I need to carry mace or have a buddy..   So I may go back for quick in and out shopping, but for big shopping trips I'll drive out of my to somewhere else.. even with the gas prices..

I have been to this place a couple of times once for dinner and a couple of times for happy hour. And I love it. The servers are friendly, the place is beautiful, the best part is the outside patio. The only two negative things are the small bar area (happy hour is only in the bar) and the birds. The birds are cute, very chatty and will join you at your table to try and share your chips.  The food was great, I got the enchiladas which were tasty and I asked to change the side and the waiter was more then happy to let me do that. A friend got the Tuna salad which she enjoyed. I am not a fish person but she let me try her tuna and it was actually pretty good. The chips that come to your table are okay, I'm not a fan of the sweet potato chips, the texture and taste just do not work for me. So when I go I ask if I can just get corn tortilla chips, and they are happy to do that too. The salsa is a red smokey salsa which is good, but you can ask for green salsa which is just as good.. maybe better  The best part of this place is the Happy hour. The drinks are cheap and tasty. The best is the Grand Canyon Margarita which a mixture of orange, cranberry and prickly pear juices, its strong and only 3 bucks. The regular margaritas are excellent, on mondays that have a 10 dollar pitcher deal, a friend and I were able to get three each out of the pitcher. Good thing she lives in walking distance to the place.   Another good thing about the happy hour is the food. The bar has its own list of items in addition to the restaurants main menu. The best thing on that list is the chicken nachos, so good, best nachos I've had in a long time. Another is the cheese crisp with carnitas, very tasty.  Most of the items on this menu are around five dollars, and for five dollars you get a lot of food enough for two.   I would highly recommend this place.

I've drove past this place many, many, times and always wrote it of as one of those typical cheap filiburtos type of places.. However, today I wanted fresh tortillas, and I heard this is a good place to go, so I went.. And I was in love with the place.. They have a bakery with yummy looking pastries things, a full menu of anything you would want at a Mexican restaurants..   I didn't take advantage of the menu options, there cooks were smoking up the place which wasn't great, smelled good but hopefully its not always smoky there..    Strolled around the small market, excited about their lower prices on what they had.. found my tortillas along with freshly grilled green peppers, both were still warm and steamy.. I was in love! There tortillas were some of the best I've had, so I am so going to go back and next time I go I'll have to try their menu..

If you are in the downtown area and need a quick lunch or a good sandwich this would be the place to go.. Walking in it kind of has a half cafeteria half restaurant feel. Inside it is huge, allowing it to handle big crowds and when you order you make your way down the guide rails and watch them make your food. There are tons of choices and tons of seating.  They also have a relaxing patio.   Food was good, I got the hot pastrami sandwich on french with provolone. So good, traveling to New York and Boston I've had some amazing hot pastrami sandwiches, living here not many places offer it hot so finding this place was awesome. My friend got the New Yorker, which is pastrami and slaw sandwich, which he loved.   For sides, I got fries, I love fries and I wasn't a huge fan, you can tell they were frozen (bad sign), my friend got the pasta salad and he said it was pretty good.   Other good points, they serve breakfast, they deliver and they allow call in orders and ask what time do you want it ready and instead of telling you what time to come. They have beer, wine and a bunch of other drink options.   Bad points, say no to the fries, traffic on central is horrible because of the light rail (I was trying to make a left and couldn't because a ROW of four cars coming the other way were all trying to make a left at the same time! What the hell?), and they are only open to 7pm..

I do like this place.. is it the best no, but I am finding that Phoenix is kind of hard to find Chinese that is good and not in a shady looking place.. I am very paranoid about food poisoning and I'm very picky about food..   So Pf Chang's, yes its a chain, its not own by Chinese people and its kind of generic but its good for what it is.. The hostess always do seem to be snotty but the waiters are nice and quick, the bar is a little expensive but that expected at a restaurant like this, but they do have a great martini menu.. Sometimes I splurge..   I usually always get the Chicken Lettuce Wraps which is one of my favorite things on the menu, they are messy but really good. I tried the vegetarian Lettuce wraps and they were just as good, maybe even better.. I asked if they were really vegetarian (I worked at a restaurant that claimed to be but weren't) and the waiter said that it was suitable for a vegan.. good to know..   For entrees I usually get the Kung Pao Chicken, very good never disappointed.. The Mongolian Beef is also pretty good.. There noodle dishes as alright pretty basic, haven't found one that I would routinely order..  But the thing I like about the food is that it is down well.. It never is too fried, or too oily of slimy etc.. some many Chinese restaurants I've been to just left me feeling like I ate a whole bucket of McDonald's fries, Chang's doesn't leave you with that heavy icky feeling..   Is it the best ever? No, but for what it is its good, I don't go often but when I do go I enjoy it..

I love this place, its great to curve pizza cravings without having to order a whole pizza and its great when you are with a group and they can't agree on what type of pizza to order, here they can get whatever they want..   Bad news first.. Depending on the time of day the pizza can be tough.. it isn't made to order.. they make all the pies in advance then when you order they throw a slice back into the oven to reheat, which isn't bad.. but when you go in late at night or between rushes you can sometimes end up with a pizza that is tough..   Over then that! I still love the there pizza, The white pizza is the best it has a light butter taste, pesto, tomatoes, and wonderful cheese.. can't get enough. The classic pepperoni is great and they have it with a bunch of other options; with mushrooms; sausage; black olive; etc.. They also have a huge mixtures of pizza's that you don't normally see, such as a greek theme with artichokes, mixture of olives, feta, and more goodness.. They also have chicken bqq and just a bunch of stuff..   I love it because it tastes good, its cheap, and you can get basically whatever you could possibly ask for on a slice.. and its great hangover  food or to wrap up a night of drinking..

I love this place. Its great for a fun relaxed night out, or for a friends birthday party or what have you. The music is good and interactive with the crowd, they help get you in a good mood. They take requests and do the best they can to sing everything they are asked, only once have they turned down one of mine, because they just didn't know it.  If you go early between 5-8, they have fantastic drink specials aka happy hour. Beers, wines, wells are 2 bucks, everything else is 3 bucks. Can't beat that :). Also the earlier you go the easier it is to find the seat. Going after 8 it is almost impossible to find a table, and standing room is kind of limited.   People some times say they play the same songs every night, and they do, because they know them, people request them all the time, and they are good group singing songs. And you have to admit to be up there playing the piano, drums or guitar and being to play a song on the spot with no music sheets is pretty awesome.

Note: This is okay if you are going with a group of really out going people and you go early during their drink specials. They start at 9 and I believe end around 10 on Saturday.. Don't take my word on that part but its 1 dollar cherry vodka, which really cough-syrup sweet be smart on what you mix it with..   Anyway.. this place is boring, unless you just turned 21. When you get in there are two rooms to go into, a lounge like-area and then the dance area.. The lounge area is okay, has the VIP room, usually not a crowded and you can actually hear people talk.. The dance room, packed, and is built like a pit so getting in and out is a challenge, you cannot hear over the typical dance club music that seems to hold the same beat the entire night..   The place does feel dirty, its dark and everything seems worn.. Bathrooms are always gross, all the seats and tables seem wet and the floor is always always sticky or slippery.. Bar area seems disorganized and chaotic.. the only nice thing about the place is the light fixtures in the dance room are cool.. The people there are a mix of college kids and a more hip hop crowd.. So you will see the college boy that just turned 21 trying to dance and you will see the girls that are dressed to impress in heels that are too high for them getting on the pole trying to grab attention.. Kind of reminded me of high school.. which is not what you want on a weekend..   So I think this place is maybe a good place to start out a night, if they're specials are going on, then go somewhere else on Mill..

Such a headache.. I've had a membership with Envy since December, had no problems loved the massages (had only one bad experience, wasn't really that bad) until today! By the way, this is a venting session, the majority of my experience with the company has been REALLY good, massages are worth every penny.. this vent is about their computer system..   I have a really bad knot(s) in my shoulders so I got a membership. So, I use to go to the one in Tempe on Elliot, loved the location, stuff was amazing everything was great. My one kind of blah experience was probably on the third or fourth time I went the girl wanted to try pressure points as well as a regular massage. She did pressure points the majority of the time, didn't do a thing to help, didn't really feel anything... but anyway..   So I moved out to the downtown area, and with their membership it is good at ANY Envy, like I could go to Kentucky and use it. Well went to this one on Camelback, called in to make an appointment... They couldn't find my membership on their computer after a few minutes of searching and checking name/phone number/address, they said they found it! However..   Showed up to the place to check in, couldn't find my membership, when they said that they found it they asked if I was still living on 48th st.. I have NEVER lived on 48th st... Asked if my number was a 602 number.. I have NEVER had a 602 number.. Asked if it could be under another name, no. ... Mom and dad don't make appointments for me anymore, and memberships are assigned to one person only, there are no couple deals.. Anyway went ahead and got my massage (it was okay, think I'd try some one else next time, which is kind of what you have to do, test out the people till you find one you really like)  I was relaxed, and the front desk person said she would have everything figured out by the end of my massage (an hour).. Came out, no progress. So went through the dance again, I had my membership keychain so we double checked the number.. She called the Tempe Envy (where I started my membership), they couldn't find me either.. What the hell? My membership has disappeared! HOWEVER, they are still taking the monthly payments out of my account.. Interesting..   I left, leaving my phone number and all the info I could give them, once again assuring them the account was under my name and my name only.. anyway.. I called the Tempe location to get the same, we can't find you response, asked to talk to a manager, no one was available.. Camelback location called back saying they found me by my membership number.. why couldn't they find me the first time, I have no idea.. Apparently all my information was screwed up, including my name, which they said is COMMON? yikes.. I asked to check how many prepaids were left on my account, they said three which is what I have so good.   However.. Tempe called me back saying they found me, my info was also screwed up, and I had no prepaids left.. umm no, so told them what Camelback told me and that they needed to talk to each other, she said they will just accept what Camelback had found.. All I can say out of this is at least they kept trying and finally did get it within twenty minutes after my massage..   So my biggest advice is: - Good place for a massage? Yes - Good prices? Yea, great prices, best deal - Variety of massages? Yes, all for the same price and a variety of time lengths - Safe, clean, nice? Yes, Yes, Yes.. they change the sheets and wipe down everything between patients, they are very polite and pay attention to requests, let you know what to do and what they are doing etc..  Good customer service, those helping didn't give up or blame me - Good membership deal? Yes, its $49 a month which pays for a massage for you each month, if you don't go for a month the massage you missed rolls over to the next month, so like me I have 3 prepaid waiting for me to use, also if you need more then one its $39 for a hour (which is almost $20 less then non-members price) and its unlimited, and they pull the payment out of your account the same day every month  *** BUT! double check that they have your membership info correct when you FIRST sign up, they fill it out for you, you just sign which is why things probably get screwed up.. and randomly check the info as your membership goes on and keep track of when you go so you know how many prepaids are there etc..  Soo I really don't know how to star it, they did screw up my membership however their service is awesome.. so.. eh..  I wish we could do half stars sometimes.. I guess minus on star?

Soo made a appointment to do a double check that these guys really had my membership info correct.. Well. They couldn't find it, rattled of a 303 phone number and a 9-hundred something number.. I've only ever have had a 520 and a 480 number.. Shocking, my account info is still screwed, however, the girl did find it and it was still the same amount of pre-paids and story of messed up info..   I told her I wanted a document of everything that she found so I have a copy of my account info in case this happens again.. Debating if I want to renew my membership.. its a great deal, good services, but such a pain in the you know what.. (If this doesn't make any sense you probably want to read my previous rant about this place..)

Do not get a membership with massage envy!   You can read from my experience from before.. but here's a new one, my membership was suppose to end last month.. However, I checked my bank account today and guess what.. they are still pulling payments!  So I called figuring they once again screwed up my account, but apparently your "year-length" membership actually would last a lifetime unless you send in a e-mail or letter asking for it to end.. Which is kind of dumb.. especially since they tell you this once when you sign up, and they send home your contract on the same day you sign up (a year ago).. and then they never mention it again... even when you ask, "When is my membership over?" They'll tell you what month, but won't remind you about the cancellation policy.. So much for feeling the warm fuzzy feeling of being called a "member.." So yes this is my fault for not remembering what was said last year, and keeping my flyer of a contract.. but it is also partly theirs for having no professional customer service.. that's what you get with a chain! (I now understand why people hate chains so much)  So massages are still good, but what is the point when the front desk leaves you with nothing but stress..?

I've never been there at night, just for lunch and happy hour. I've never seen the place busy so on service I am going to give it two thumbs up. The servers are helpful and kind. The bartenders will chat with you and comment on the game with you.   The happy hour drinks are a good price, 3 dollars for wells and 2.50 for beer. And the wells are strong, I've had to ask for more tonic because the bartender was a little too giving, which really isn't a bad thing. They have specials on drinks almost every night of the week, shots, mixed drinks whatever, which is awesome.   The food, haven't been disappointed yet. I've had the smoke turkey sandwich, the bread was a little tough, but it had fresh herb lettuce and brie cheese which was wonderful. Also the jerk chicken on flat bread is to die for, especially, if you are looking for something light. The salads are amazing and come with either steak or tuna, both are tasty.   For entertainment they have a couple of flat TVs at the bar area. On various afternoons they have live music, usually a fusion of hip-hop/R&B. They also have fantastic Djs that mix just about everything.   Overall its a great relaxed place, for nightlife I heard its one of the best, so maybe one of these nights I'll stop being old and go out :)

Finally found and went to this place the other night and I was soo happy I did. The place is off of Stetson and is located on the back of all the shops, over looking the canals, hence the name. Inside the place it is classy with a rustic touch so its good for a romantic date, a night out with the girls or with the guys, or a family night.. Just a heads up, there is a runway, so if your are wanting a romantic date you probably want to figure out when they do their shows...  Back to the important stuff.. Service was good, our waiter gave great advice, was able to answer our questions, and came back to check on us. Also they have the back-up servers, which I love because that means that as soon as my food was ready it came right to me, instead of sitting and wait for the main server.. Another good thing our waiter told us is that everything in the restaurant is fresh, except the grapefruit juice, they make their own pasta, sauces, juices, even down to the sweet and sour mix at the bar..  Drinks that had a book that you could choose from, which was a little intimidating, but they just got voted as best place for a Martini so they must be good, I stuck white a glass of wine.. They are kind of expensive, but that is not really a shocker for Scottsdale's restaurants.   For food we started with the Ahi three ways the group I was with loved it, even I tried it and I'm not a fish person, and it was good. We also got the Tuscan Bread Salad, one of the best salads I've ever had.   Main meals, I got the Grilled Chicken layered pasta.. I loved it. It tasted fresh, it was the right size, and not a over powering taste to it. The only bad thing about was that the pasta was was in long wide strips, so trying to get it on a fork was a little hard, but it was worth it. Other people at my table got the bass, Mahi tacos, and snapper, which they all loved, no complaints. For Dessert we got the peach cheesecake (very, very good), the Chocolate layered cake, and sorbet, also very good.    So overall the place was amazing, would for sure go back, it is on the expensive side so be prepared to spend a lot on dinner. Also if you look at the menu that they have posted online it doesn't have all of their menu items on it, such as the Chicken pasta..

Fantastic.. This is a great place to get some tasty Mexican food and margaritas. The Prickly Pear Margarita is wonderful, but you have to have a sweet tooth for it, however, their regular lime margaritas are some of the best in town.   The Motto of the restaurant is "Some like it hot" and for the most part, you do need to like spicy food to eat here. There are menu items that are low on the spicy side, however the salsas are usually pretty hot. When I say "usually" it means that it isn't always very spicy and this when people can be disappointed in the restaurant. Everything is homemade and made by scratch, which is a good thing but doesn't mean everything is going to be the same. The chili's that they use to make the salsa and sauces etc, are spicy depending on the season. (Just like in the store, you can only really get cherries at certain times). I've found the the summer season, esp. June is when Molinos is at its hottest (ate there a few days ago and had to down 3 huge glasses of water to make it through the meal).  In the winter months things are usually not very hot there.. But still tasty.   What I usually get is the Carne Adovada Chimichanga with green chili.. it is to die for, I've gotten it many times and I would have to say its one of the best chimichanga I have ever had. A couple of other items that are good is the blue corn enchiladas with green chill and the carne adovada platter is excellent.   The reason Molinos doesn't get five stars is because service can sometime be.. interesting. This one on Washington isn't very busy, however, it seems like there is really only one waiter taking care of the restaurant so it can take time to place orders, but food comes out quickly.   The Molinos on Central Ave, there are more servers but it ten times busier and when the servers/hostess gets stressed out they tend to take it out on the costumers.. I had called in to get a table of eight reserved, however, when I got there with five of us and the other three where in the parking lot. I asked for our table and the hostess looked at us and asked for the rest of our party. I  explained that they were on their way in. And she replied well they're not with you, we're giving your table away. My three other people walked in before she finished saying this and she refused to change her mind.   I would highly recommend going to the Molinos on Washington instead of Central..

The place looks great and is in a great location so you are thinkin' you are in for an amazing meal.. nope. The service was spotty at best and the wine was good.. The food not so much..   We first started with the crab cakes, which was a special that night, those were good but difficult to eat.. Crab cakes are suppose to be soft but they should stick together.. these just fell apart to the point we started using a combo of spoon and fingers to finish them..   Next came out salads.. interesting. One of us got the caesar salad which were full leaves of romaine lettuce (three to be exact) that were soaked in dressing and water, more water then dressing. Another of us got the farm to table salad, a warm salad or bean, mushrooms etc.. that was actually good.   Meal time, took forever to get our food.. and I was hugely disappointed in mine. I got the lamb pasta, excited for freshly made pasta and sauce.. The sauce was beyond salty, the supposed lamb meatballs were just ground up through out the sauce, couldn't taste it, and the pasta wasn't cooked all the way.. Also, I had assumed that since the dish was 17 dollars I would be getting more then I could eat.. Nope. It was served in a line, maybe longer then my hand, so maybe 15 pieces of pasta.. right.   The people I went with had better luck with getting the fish.. they enjoyed it quite a bit.. one got duck, overcooked and chewy..   Bottom line, this restaurant is good if you want to spend a lot of money, Our tab was over 300 for five or us. If you like the idea of ordering a variety of meals that honestly don't connect well together and you like fish. Or you are willing to do what I did and hit up Slices pizza on Mill Ave on the way home so you don't go home hungry..   If you want to spend money on a good meal i would suggest Roy's or Arrivederci

I loved this place and was glad it was my first yoga experience. I went to the 7am fundamentals class that was instructed by Todd.. I got there early and the place was empty, filled out my forms praying that another person would show up for class no one did.. so I got a private class with Todd which is amazing since private sessions are always so expensive but scary as hell feeling completely out of shape and being the only one there.. However, Todd made the class very relaxing and I felt perfectly comfortable even with my legs shaking and feet slipping all over the place..   By the end of the session end with him having me test some harder poses and a nice breathing/meditation at the end.. He gave me a hug when I said I found the studio at Yelp :) I am going to be sore, can already feel it but can't wait to go back for another class.. I would highly recommend this studio its beautiful and the people are very caring about their students..
