I've been using Central Barber Shop for years, with very few exceptions.  I need a haircut every 4 weeks and I always leave Central with a smile.  I have had all of the barbers cut my hair, but I prefer to use Abrahigm or Roman.  Previously, Roman's dad, Boris, was also excellent.  I have never had to wait more than one person to get one of those guys, and usually get to sit down in one of their chairs as soon as I walk though the door.  The cut and the hot towel and massage are all so relaxing.  I have also had several shaves there as part of my service.  Closer shave than I can ever give myself, and you'd never believe how relaxing it is to have a guy with a sharp blade that close to the jugular!  I always leave there knowing that I couldn't have had better service anywhere else.  I would recommend it to everybody!

I love Spinato's pizza.  I usually get a gluten free Get Meaty.  The gluten free crust is better than any I've had.  Their regular crust is, of course, delicious as we'll, but I have come to enjoy the gluten free crust even better than the regular.  My family loves to go to Spinato's.

Pom and Cheer Classes - 0 stars if I could.  Totally unimpressed after day 1, but I was already invested $70 per kid (x2) so I was hooked.  Here I am 5 weeks later taking them both out and enrolling them in activities elsewhere. The flyer that my girls brought home from school made this program sound wonderful!  I fell for it hook, line, and now I am the sinker.  The flyer's luster quickly turned sour when I heard the orientation speech from the instructor.  A fee for everything.  The $7 per class that the flyer made sound so great quickly turned into a cost for uniforms, a cost for pom poms and different color pom poms as your kid advances (similar to a belt program in martial arts).  A fee for the test to get into the next color of pom pom.  A back fee if your kid missed a class and didn't pay the $7, and all fees must be up to date for your kid to take the test to advance.  The list goes on.  I was disappointed enough with those fees, but the disorganization of the staff members was also a downer.  They had all kinds of very specific instructions on properly signing in your kid to be given credit for attendance, and then most of the time, the instructor that carries the sign in form that would allow me to do that didn't show up until after the class started.  After a few weeks of instruction, the teacher also said we could find the routine on YouTube so that our kids could practice.  She didn't give a link or anything.  I searched and searched and I can assure you that the routine is not online, YouTube or anywhere.  My wife was also not real happy with the whole false advertising on the flier thing, but then she got really upset when she heard the instructor yell at the kids to sit on their butts and be quiet. I assume the fantastic reviews that I see for this organization are by parents who want nothing else than for their kids to be cheerleaders and who have very few choices to be elsewhere, so they're forced to tolerate this bullsh!t and disorganization.  As well, they're forced to brown nose these instructors so that their kid stands out as a favorite.  Take my advice.  Go elsewhere for your kids' activities.  I just enrolled my kids at Flip Dunk Sports for tunbling, conditioning, and trampoline.  I have been happy with prior one off experiences there and I think my kids will enjoy this more.

It's easy to give Papago Park a 5 star rating! I've been coming to the park all of my 45 years and have great memories, including living right on the western border overlooking the golf course for over a year. I have used the park facilities and amenities in every way shape or form.  As a visitor to the zoo, I've played real golf (at Papago and Rolling Hills) and disc golf here.  I've climbed, hiked, mountain biked and road cycled here.  I have visited the Desert Botanical Garden and I have seen one of the greatest concerts of my life (Keiko Matsui) there.  I have enjoyed watching the squirrels, fish, ducks, turtles, and coyotes that live here. Disc Golf (Moeur Park):  This course is a big challenge!  There is running water involved in the first several holes and you should steer well clear of that.  My buddies have fallen in the river (canal) while trying to cross it or retrieve their disks right out of it.  The course is also very thickly forested, especially right around the river.  Your disk can get eaten by the bush, so bring something to retrieve it at least.  It's really cool to play here.  You're in the middle of the city but it feels far away, somehow, between the serenity of the running water and the brushy desert terrain. Golf:  I love the Rolling Hills course.  The terrain is different from most courses in the valley and it plays into my style, although I'm not enough of a golfer to really have a style.  The "Papago" course is also really nice and fun. Mountain Biking:  This is the nicest set of trails in the valley.  They are smooth and rolling rather than jagged and pretty easy to navigate. They are also plentiful with acreage full of trails to explore.  They are also part of the larger system of trails connecting to the rest of the valley via the crosscut canal and also the Tempe Town Lake.  Really great cycling here. The zoo is outstanding!  In addition to the great selection of animals, there are two water features in which the kids love to get wet!  We have been members of the zoo off and on, but currently we are not.  My wife just mentioned that we should renew our membership and get going back there regularly. I've spent some time fishing in the ponds at Papago with very little luck, but if you keep an eye on the right websites, you can find out when they stock the lakes and have a better opportunity at getting something on your line. Desert Botanical Garden is a relaxing place to walk around and not to miss. Hole in the Rock is a great climb, but beware that it is much harder to get down than to get up, and you should probably keep looking behind you and down on the way up to make sure you're willing to go further before you get up there and get scared.  The hole also has ancient historical significance, as the sunrise shines through it on the winter solstice and hits the point on which the nearby Pueblo Grande (Museum) was built.  It is a very significant location for the ancient Anasazi where they initiated several canals coming off of the Rio Salado. Papago is a great place!  I would give it more stars if they were available.

Disc golf course is a great place for people just getting into the game. Few trees come into play and no permanent water hazards, but this is a river bed so you might avoid it after rains. There are lots of drives from up high so it's a great place to feel good about the longer distances you can achieve because of that. Bring a decently Insulated canteen with you as you start and finish near the restroom/drinking fountain but you're well away from them over the course of your game. My game wasn't great but the time there with a group of 8 of us playing today was outstanding.

Worth a visit. The 4/5 is mostly based on the chips and salsa being $2.50, small in quantity, and not all that great. The Carne Asada burrito was outstanding. The red chile beef enchilada was outstanding. The chorizo breakfast burrito was plentiful but lacked the spice and full flavor that I like out of my chorizo. The marinated pork burrito deep fried and smothered in red sauce was a bit on the sweet side for Mexican cuisine but it was good and, like everything else, big enough to get all the value out of the price paid. We didn't partake in the bar offerings but the margaritas tempted me. We also dropped the ball on looking around before ordering as we missed the specials board for Taco Tuesday at a buck a piece. The value was great and we will be back to try the red chile beef and green chile pork burritos. Glad we finally tried this place after living close by for more than 2 years.

Bosa is easily the best donut shop in the valley.  Take your Krispy Kream and shove it. Anyone can heat up a donut to make it taste better, but Bosa doesn't need that. They're great even if they're a day old. Also, everybody says the apple fritter is the bomb. I don't know about that, but the bear claw is filled with baked apples and I have never had a better donut, EVER, than that! Their cinnamon swirls are also out of this world. Yum!

This is a challenging disc golf course. Lots of desert shrubbery, rocks, and rough terrain. Several holes are equipped with flags so that you can see them peeking out from the brush. You are going for a decently difficult hike when you play this course, so dress accordingly. I enjoy courses with elevation change and this one certainly has that. The course is set up as an 18 holer but there is also a 27 holer available through my favorite scoring app (UDisc). The playground, fields, and facilities are all kept up nicely. I have also biked these trails on my mountain bike and they are nice and smooth and not as difficult to navigate as the disc golf course is. Really fun place!

Disc golf here is a 9 hole course that plays pretty quickly. I especially like coming here for practice before and after work. This is an old olive grove so the holes are located amongst neat rows of trees that want to eat your discs. I always carry a telescoping stick (it's actually a golf ball retriever) with me to easily knock them down when they get stuck there.  Those rows make it easy to line up your shot and I improve my game through my visits here. Also, I like to throw back and forth between holes 3 and 8, conveniently located near each other, to improve my short game. My kids like the playground but the local teenagers tend to hang out there. While I have not had contact or incident with any of them, it does make me nervous sometimes, and it is often that there are older kids around there. Bathrooms are near the playground so that's nice when the kids decide they need one amidst their play. Really nice Park!

It's easy for disc golfers to write this course off after one or two rounds. It's a short course and so it is automatically assumed that it's an easy course.  Many a golfer to whom I've mentioned that this is my home course has poo pooed it and scoffed at me for bringing it up. It is, however, a very challenging course. There are plenty of tunnel shots to be made through the neat rows of olive trees, including the mandatory under/through them on hole 8.  There are also a few long shots that need to heiser or anheiser into position just perfectly or you will find yourself with a throw that needs to be put through, around, or over a tree to basket out. I have played this course 5 times per week for months and have yet to master it. A recent basket move added to the challenge, but it's always a beast. Don't knock it until you've given it a chance to knock you! If you see me out there with my extending tree pole, join me for a round or two. Always looking to learn a thing or two from another's perspective.
