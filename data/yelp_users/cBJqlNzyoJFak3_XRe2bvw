I work around the corner and go here sometimes for a quick lunch. I've never had a problem here until today. I walk in, order my flat bread, sit down and BAM! In my sandwich is a HUGE grasshopper just jammed in there with the head popping out! I didn't freak out outwardly just calmly walked over to the cashier and showed her my sandwich. She joked that it's just a "little extra protein" but would make me a new sandwich. News flash...this is AMERICA, nobody wants to eat that kind of "protein" at Subway! My stomach is still hurting from the sight and for my trouble was offered "2 free cookies". Great, thanks. All in all, I will never come back and probably would never eat at Subway again!

This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends.

I came here on a whim as I was driving by because the world cannot stand to have my boyfriend wearing shirts that just aren't long enough anymore! I walked inside and was immediately greeted and asked how I could be helped. I let them know it was my first time in and was looking for some shirts for my boyfriend. They were more than happy to show me around to different areas (including clearance) to help me look for something nice. I ended buying 2 shirts, both of which my boyfriend loves! I bought both shirts in clearance but still ended up with a $63 bill so definitely not cheap. The salesman wasn't pushy and was really helpful. I decided to sign up for the membership program because they told me a location would soon be opening in Chandler, which is closer to where I live. I took my time inside and enjoyed my experience. If you have a big/tall man in your life, definitely direct him here!

I've been eyeing this place for a long time and I was recently in the area (and craving Italian) so I stopped in. It was just before the lunch rush so I was able to browse their cute little store, which I bought some rigatoni pasta and ordered a chicken parm sandwich. The owner was so sweet and helpful- she told me it would be about a 15 minute wait. I sat myself in their adjacent dining room and waited. It turned out to be a 25 minute wait but the sandwich was amazing! Other than the longer wait time, I also was surprised that their bakery didn't have more desserts- just breads from what I saw. I would have definitely bought a dessert had I seen any. The prices are a bit steep as well- the pasta was $3.25, their canned soda $1 and the sandwich $10.   I enjoyed the food, customer service and the pasta I cooked later that week. Good experience overall

The majority of my technology gadgets are not Apple but I have visited this store a few times and have been impressed each time. There are tons of staff members around to help and greet you, even when the store is crazy busy. I had the pleasure of working with Quin and Stephen and both are exceptional staff. Stephen gave the youth I work with an amazing experience through the Apple Store "Field Trip". I was impressed at how much they learned and it's always rewarding to see a child smile and enjoy themselves. If you work with youth and are looking for an awesome (and free) field trip, definitely check this one out! Store is clean, cool and enjoyable to use all the product! Great location too...lots of stores and restaurants in the same complex. Definitely recommend!

Just like the 5 stars review says, Woohoo! As good as it gets! My friend knows the owners and I love the flowers here! They are beautiful, probably the best flowers I've seen! I know they are a bit pricey but if you're serious about flowers, this place is it! Great service, great store, great flowers. Done.

If you're craving Chinese (or good food for that matter), check out Desert Jade. I came here on my lunch hour. Service was attentive and food came out really fast. The crowd starting really coming in at noon so I just missed it by coming in a little after 11AM. I ordered the lunch portion of the chicken broccoli, which also came with a scoop or rice and an egg roll. Hot tea is also available at each table. I really enjoyed the food and my experience. I will be back!

I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache, which is a breaded sausage and cheese pastry. You can get it spicy or not, I chose for the not spicy warmed up. It was delicious! As far as donuts, their glazed is addicting. I also got an iced chai, which was very flavorful and delicious. Restaurant inside has bar seating and a few tables. Staff is also really friendly. Overall winner here!!

To be honest, I wasn't expecting amazing at David's Bridal but my recent visit was worst than expected. My sister is on the hunt for a wedding dress and wanted to check out a few she liked online in store. This was her first ever appointment and she came with her mini entourage (me included of course). As we arrived, we were greeted but it took a while for someone to take us back to fittings. It was quite awkward standing in the middle of the store with no direction or place to sit while we waited..  This is when the appointment got slightly better. Our consultant was very sweet but double booked. It was fun getting to see all the different brides trying on their dresses and having those "a-ha" moments with what they liked but not so fun waiting 10-15 minutes for my sister to get her undergarments and then another 10-15 minutes just to try dresses on. At one point, I was in there tying her up into dresses because the consultant was busy. By the way, those dressing rooms are TINY for a bridal store!! Wow, two people were pretty squishy in there plus trying on dresses. I wish they would have given each bride her special time rather than squeeze people into time slots. The consultant was very knowledgeable about the dresses and picked many styles my sister wanted to try on. For our 2 hour appointment, she was able to try on about 10 dresses, which was great to see her in so many styles.  To make a long story short, she did find a beautiful dress but wants to keep looking. I will say David's Bridal is nice for lower budget options and for brides who need a dress quickly.

As a friend of the family and being half Polish, this place is absolutely wonderful! They have delicious food on top of "market" type items that are found in traditional Eastern European cooking that you can buy. I love coming here because it reminds of my heritage and has awesome food! The place is pretty tiny but the food will keep you coming back again and again! Too bad it's really far away from my home or I would be here on a weekly basis!

I was in the area and wanted something non-chain and not a sit down restaurant. Bread crafters is tiny (doesn't even have a public restroom) but very cutely decorated. The guy behind the counter was very helpful on my first visit and even had a chance to sample the soup of the day. The lunch special was good and I liked the soup bowls. I didn't try a pastry but noticed lots of goodies. I'm glad I stopped here!

I had the pleasure of attending Rustler's Rooste for my company's Christmas party. The restaurant is really fun and enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. The slide...is awesome! The view and patio are also great! The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the meats we were served at the luncheon. The steak was more than well done and the chicken was dry. I know if I came back to the restaurant and had the chance to order something else, I would be happy. Also, for some reason, I couldn't connect to their Wi-Fi. I would have loved to post on social media that I was there but my phone wouldn't connect.    I want to come back sometime in the evening to enjoy music, the view and the company. I will return!

I've been to this location a few times but last night was the WORST service I've had at a restaurant in a very long time. We got here a little before reverse happy hour so we waited to order food and drinks until 9pm. Our waitress barely came to our table to check on us and the place was pretty dead. We ordered our food at 9:10, got our pot stickers appetizer at 9:45pm. I ordered a sangria and it took about 20 minutes for it to come out. Our friends couldn't get a refill on water and iced tea to save their life...the list goes on and on here. All of our entrees were cold and tasted like they had been re-heated and sitting under a heat lamp for a while. Really not appetizing and we all left hungry. When we asked to speak to the manager, she offered us a "free" dessert and after 30 minutes of waiting, we walked over to the hostess stand and waited to speak to her again. At this point, we didn't even want the dessert or anything to do with the place. Oh, and on top of everything, the place was FREEZING!! Yes that sounds great in the summer but it was unbearably cold. Overall, this is a very poorly run restaurant with very poor service. We were comped the food and offered a couple coupons but I am certain I will never come back here!!

I've been here a few times and have enjoyed myself each time. I am reminded of Texas with the country music, laid back decor and of course, the food! You walk in and see steaks in the chiller...mmmm beef!! You are immediately greeted with amazing rolls ad cinnamon butter as you sit down...both are amazing! Service is attentive and prices are really reasonable. If you don't eat meat or are on a diet, I really wouldn't suggest going here because eveerything is meat and butter here. I've ordered the BBQ chicken and filet medalions, both are cooked perfectly and taste good. I haven't ordered their speciality cocktails but they look amazing!! Good beer prices though...overall a thumbs up for me and will keep returning!  TIP: If you go on a weekend night, expect a wait. Last time I went on a Saturday, the wait was over an hour. But, if you go on a week night, there isn't a wait at all!

In my experience, there aren't a lot of stores who sell the items Mary Immaculate has around the Valley. I've gone here a couple times and have enjoyed my experiences. It may be a little overwhelming for some but there are a lot of religious books and trinkets to choose from here. Staff is helpful and personable. Will be returning today to purchase a St. Michael pendant as a gift to a friend who just graduated the police academy. My only complaint is how expensive everything is!

If I had to rate Dunkin Donuts soley on their beverages and donuts, I would rate it much higher than 2 stars because this place is great for that. But for lunch and service, I was very disappointed. I went through the drive-thru today for a vanilla chai and a turkey, cheddar and bacon sandwich. There were only 2 cars ahead of me and somehow was in the drive-thru for a total of almost 20 minutes. The girl at the drive-thru window did apologize for the wait but still, not the reason why I go to the drive thru...I go because it's supposed to be fast and convenient!!! When I took out the sandwich, it had some sort of sauce all over the wrapper and the paper was sticking to the bag. When I opened the sandwich, I bit into stale bread and a horrible tasting sauce on the turkey! It was so nasty!! On top of that, I opened up the sandwich to wipe the sauce off and noticed a torn off piece of notebook paper stuck to the turkey!!! The chai they gave me was also sticky and had brown stuff floating on the top. The drink was also warm, even though I ordered it iced. I do like the flavor of the vanilla chai (I"ve ordered it before and obviously like it). Completely disgusted and will not be returning for lunch or to the drive-thru!!

The last few times I've been to Red Lobster, the food has been pretty bad. On this particular night, we decided to go because my boyfriend had a $25 gift card. The gift card helped with the cost, but dinner was still around $30 out of pocket (and that's with their new 4 courses for $14.99) deal and no alcohol.   We decided to order an appetizer (calamari) and that was the best thing we ate all night! The new england clam chower soup was a joke!! It was really watery and I found myself having to add salt and pepper for more flavor. I didn't even finish it and new england clam chowder is my favorite soup!!  Next was a caesar salad, which was good. For my entree, I had the grilled honey BBQ shrimp. I was really unimpressed and thought it was bland. For dessert, I had the brownie. It was a good portion size for the amount of food I had already eaten and tasted good.  At this location, I felt uncomortable with our server. He never looked at my boyfriend when he came to our table and was coming over to check on us constantly to see if we needed anything. It was annoying and distracted my boyfriend and I from any conversation we were having at the time. We still tipped him well but both felt uncomfortable.  Needless to say, I will not be venturing to Red Lobster anytime soon. I feel as though there are much better seafood places for a better or more reasonable price.

After seeing all the 2nd pasta helping commercials on TV, my boyfriend and I decided to have Italian for date night. We were seated promptly upon arrival but noticed an odd smell coming from the dining room. The wood burning grill was close to where we were seated but it smelled off. Our server was slow to arrive for drink orders and my boyfriend kept having to drink my water because our server neglected to fill water. I ordered a glass a wine, which of course was delicious. Bread came and was honestly the best thing we ate all night. I loved the olive oil and spice mixture! I ordered the pasta Carraba and a Caesar salad. The salad was really over-dressed and the dressing had quite a peppery kick. I like pepper but not overpowering. For the 2nd pasta helping, there were only 3 options and none of them resembled the pasta on the commercial. The pasta I ordered was very disappointing, very mushy. The chicken was grilled nicely but for $15.50, the pasta wasn't prepared better than what I could have made at home for a lot cheaper. We skipped dessert and took my leftover pasta home. I did like that we were given bread, olive oil and spice mixture (since that was delicious). It has been a while since I had visited Carraba's and now I know why. Everything was mediocre and for me, I don't like visiting places that are just OK.

After signing up for their e-mail list, I was pleasantly surprised to find a $25 coupon sitting in my e-mail for my birthday. I had only been to the Keg once before (a very long time ago) so I was very excited to try again and take my boyfriend, who had never been. We did go on a weeknight (coupon stipulation for weekends) but liked the fact that it wasn't as hectic and busy as on a weekend night. Since it was my birthday dinner, my boyfriend I got all dressed up and went out for a nice dinner.  We were seated immediately at a spacious booth next to a large fireplace. The ambience reminded me of an upscale lodge. Our server was very attentive and charismatic. He made our experience fun but not overwhelming us with unnecessary visits to our table. We were given a loaf of wonderful bread to start. Our server made awesome dinner selections, including my boyfriend's filet oscar entree. I went with the 10 oz filet mignon and a side of steamed veggies. We ordered our steaks cooked medium and medium rare. Both were cooked very well. Everything we ate was top notch!  The best part comes with dessert! The GM came over to our table and not only wished me a Happy Birthday with his adorable baby boy in his arms but gave us a free Miner Pie. OMG it was incredible!! I think the idea of giving us that kind of service was better than the actual pie for dessert.  For the food and service we received, the prices were on point. The Keg is not a cheap place but is very delicious and service was great. I will definitely return and my boyfriend even said he would return for his birthday dinner in the summertime :)

I've gone here a few times and have always liked the food and service. I like coming for their happy hour (and reverse happy hour). Their menu is huge (think Cheesecake Factory) but everything I have had is good. The ambience of the restaurant is nice, not a big place but it's cool to see the brewery through the glass next to the restaurant. I would recommend the pizza!! They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies, which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips & salsa. Both can be improved :)

Is Liberty Market my favorite place to eat? No, but it is unique, sits in downtown Gilbert and just has that "likeability" quality. Their food choices are classic (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) and for the most part, tasty. I like the ambience inside, everything is wide open and welcoming. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. I guess I just can't say I love anything I've tried here. The margherita pizza to me doesn't really resemble a margherita pizza. There aren't slices of tomato, basil and mozzarella on top but sliced really thin and almost could pass a cheese pizza without the small strips of basil on top. I also recently ventured to try a dessert, which was highly recommended by the cashier, and I really hated it. I don't remember the name of it but it was essentially a brownie/cookie made with corn flakes. It was overly sweet and had a very odd texture. No go for me! I recall breakfast choices being better and might go again soon to recall my distant memory.

The wait and line can seem intimidating but I finally went to Farmhouse for Sunday brunch. The wait was 15 min, no big deal. If there's nobody outside,  write your name and party number on the clipboard outside to get your name down on the list. We went inside and the restaurant is so charming but small. Tables get turned quickly. We were seated in a booth and given a menu with one side breakfast and one side lunch. I went with the Belgian waffle and my fiance had the #18 scrambler. Food came out quickly and portions are just right. Food was decent, I thought my fiance's food was better than my waffle. Prices are good, much better than other breakfast options nearby. I would come again.

I've been going to Paulenes for years to get pedicures. Depending on the day and time, this place can get pretty packed. If you go on a weekday during the middle of the day, I've found the experience to be wonderful with a longer massage. The ladies are friendly and do a good job. I really love the hot stones they rub on your legs with the lotion.   If you're looking for a clean, professional place to get a pedicure, I would recommend this place. The prices are a tad high but is nice to spoil yourself every once in a while. For a regular pedicure, callus removal and tip, I usually pay around $25. I've never had a terrible experience there and do come with friends often.

I ordered the turkey sandwich and coleslaw on my stop for lunch. I liked everything I ordered but I felt it was a pricy. The sandwich was a good size though and took half of it home. The décor here is pretty dated but has ample seating. The options here were also plenty and had stuff I'd never heard of or seen before. It's definitely unique to the area so if you're in the mood for casual but good food, stop here.

I've been eating at Casella's for years!! I used to live down the street and go more often then I do now but even when I'm in the area, I try and stop by. The decor is old but if you look past that, you will discover the family friendliness and food are incredible! I usually order the turkey sub but their chicken salad sub is THE BEST! Unfortunately, this place isn't super healthy but boy is it tasty!  Just remember to bring cash because they don't accept anything else!!

I had the pleasure of attending a luncheon meeting on the Tuscany @ McCormick Ranch property and was blown away! The grounds are stunning, the restaurant and food were great and the staff were very knowledgeable and welcoming. I was able to take a tour and see a vacant villa, which is beautiful! I would recommend saying hello and taking time to visit here!

I've been coming here for years and it is definitely the best bagel shop in town!! They have a wide variety of bagels, cream cheese and sandwiches that are all delicious! I would personally recommend the egg and oreo bagels. Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable. They also have really good lemonade :)  Overall, if you're in the area or looking for a nice bagel/sandwich shop, check this place out!! Oh, and they offer a lot of coupons and specials on their Facebook page so be sure to check for those too!

I recently went here for lunch with a co-worker. It is literally around the corner from our office so we wanted to try someplace new. I had only had Thai once before at a different restaurant so I was a little hesitant to try it since I don't enjoy really spicy food. The place itself is pretty small but were greeted promptly and given our drinks quickly. I really enjoyed the soup that came with the lunch special I ordered (mango chicken). The mango chicken was really delicious and I made sure to order it mild. I tried the yellow curry dish my friend ordered and liked that as well.   I will definitely come back for it's convenience, quick service and good food. It was also priced well!

Oh my gosh! My stomach is growling just from writing this review and remembering the aromas and deliciousness of this place! A co-worker took me here for lunch and I was blown away at how amazing the food was for such an affordable price! The fry bread itself is divine! I ordered a bowl of menudo and it was so good! If I lived or worked anywhere near here, I would go every-day (OK that's probably not true) but as often as possible! My only advice would be that it can be hard to see so drive slowly down 7th ave so you don't miss it. Yum yum, must go!

Even though this Game Stop is located in a rough neighborhood, the staff and cleanliness of this store would never show it. Dave (general manager) is top notch and very professional. All staff are helpful and knowledgeable about the games. I've  never been in the store where I wasn't immedately greeted and asked if I could be assisted. Overall, one of the better Game Stops I've been to and I look forward to the progress being made here.

I just got home from the festival and had a great time, like I always do. I've gone to the Ren Fair many times in my life and I always love getting immersed in the Medieval time period. It is really far outside the valley but it's nice to drive out and see the Superstition Mountains up close.   Pros: Buy tickets at Fry's beforehand (saves you money and lines), food is good, drinks are aplenty, cool stores, hair braiding and shows.  Cons: Can be really crowded, pricey, women wearing skimpy clothes that they shouldn't be wearing, coming/going traffic and waits  For shows, I would recommend Ded Bob and Tortuga Twins. The fire whip show is also really cool. The pirate show is also not bad (very inappropriate thought for kids). I don't have children so I don't know of the good child friendly shows (but there are lots since a lot of kids are there).  All in all, it's a fun thing to do if you're willing to drive and spend some money. Would recommend going!

I love a good dive bar but this place is disgusting! I was with a group of 7 looking for a bite to eat on a Saturday evening before making the long drive to Glendale for a pre-season Cards game. We walked in and the place was dead...nobody was in the dining area and a few people were sitting around the bar drinking. Inside it was dark, dingy and felt dirty. While waiting for service, I noticed a small stage and a few games to play but nobody was even around this area. We waited a solid 10 minutes and were never greeted nor did anyone come to take our drink/food order. Since we were in a hurry, we decided to leave. One of the people in my party yelled as we were walking out "You just lost about $300 in business by not even acknowledging us!". True fact. I won't be back.

I must say, Applebee's has really stepped up their game lately! I've been to 2 of their locations in the past few months and haven't been disappointed at all. Their HH is awesome and they have re-vamped their menu. The drink menu is also really good. I specifically enjoy the white peach sangria and you can't go wrong with a $3 20 oz beer on draft. I literally live around the corner from this location and have visited several times (carside to go included). The customer service is quite wonderful; everyone is very friendly and helpful. The carside to go is super convenient and fast so if you're in a hurry or don't want to eat inside, get it to go. The 2 for $20 is also a nice option (but limited) if you're wanting to eat out for less. Overall, 5 stars to Applebee's and this location especially!

I've been to Kona a few times but have learned the best time to go is happy hour. The place is lively and the drinks are awesome! I would definitely recommend the chambord margarita. It is one of the best margaritas I have ever had!! And, for $4, it's pretty inexpensive. I also enjoy their sushi and appetizers.   Kona is a nice place to go for drinks and a meal. I would recommend it.

I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. I've gone twice with the first time being my boyfriend's birthday dinner and the second just a dinner out with friends. I would agree that the service here isn't stellar but nothing horrible enough to write/complain about on a review.   Pro's: Great patio and indoor atmosphere, great tortillas (I've had the cheddar cheese and red pepper), good food  Con's: Weak margaritas (for the price), limited indoor seating and limited menu  Overall, I had a nice time both experiences and would recommend to others. I would like to go back when the weather is cooler so I can experience the patio.

The ambience of Kazmierz is cool, I like the fact that it's dark inside and looks like a basement wine cellar (with a bar and dance floor of course!) It is pretty laid back and loungy, so nothing like the crazy club scene some of Old Town Scottsdale has going on. I love coming here with friends to enjoy wine and appetizers. Every time I have been, we have had good service and have listened to good live music. I like bringing new people too because they always seem to enjoy it just as much as I do!

My review is specifically related to the bridal department:  I've had the pleasure of ordering a bridesmaids dress through Nordstrom's before with a fabulous experience so I came here to look at bridesmaids dresses for my wedding. I was in LOVE with the Donna Morgan dresses, specifically the candy apple green color for my outside garden wedding. 3 of my girls, my mom and I came in on our Sunday morning appointment and were treated so well. Terri is very accommodating and sweet- she even called me in advance to let me know the Donna Morgan dresses were running a 25% off sale at the time of my appointment! We got the fitting room to our party and loved having the girls try on the dresses. We ended up picking the dress I had my eye on and everyone loves their dress! Dresses came in a WEEK later and were shipped to my girls living out of state in less than a week. Amazing experience, amazing dress and a really good price! Thank you Terri and the Nordstrom's team for making this experience so wonderful!

I tried Body Solutions as a Groupon offer. My sister and I bought 6 treatments for 2 small areas for $99. That's a steal if you ask me!  I decided to treat my forearms and chin. I had never been to a laser place before and had never recieved laser hair removal. I was hesitant but willing to try something to remove virtually pain free and more permanent to remove this unwanted hair!!  For the first few treatments, I didn't see a lot of results but was reassured by staff that it could take up to 6 treatments. Around my 5th treatment, I noticed a huge difference on my arm hair growth and was very excited! After my last treatment, I didn't see a lot of difference with my chin but did with my arms. I rarely shave those areas anymore and am very pleased with the results.   Overall, the staff was friendly and very willing to answer any questions. I was able to schedule appointments on weekends, which was a huge convenience for me since I live far and work during the week. The place was clean and very professional. I would recommend this place for sure!

This place is pretty dang cool! It's right off Scottsdale Road (just before Oak). Part grocery store, part restaurant, part deli, this place has a lot to offer. I've eaten here a couple times and have enjoyed the food. They have Italian classics to sandwiches (and desserts!). So yummy!! The only criticism I have is that it is really small inside. I feel squished trying to pass through people in the aisles and the seating to eat is pretty tight too. Other than that, it's fantastico!

This place is awesome!! I go here often with friends and always have a good time. The food is pretty good but the beer is why you go. My favorites are the oatmeal stout, peach ale and kiltlifter. The pumpkin porter is also good but only a seasonal flavor. This place is pretty busy at night but is a fun atmosphere to be with friends, drink and watch a ballgame. I would recommend the Tempe location far beyond the Scottsdale one as far as atmosphere and actually seeing the brewery itself.  Never been disappointed here and will continue coming back!!

I was in the area and decided I would check this place out. Let me just say this, the time to go to this place is around 3PM because you will get treated like a king (or in my case, a queen! :)  I didn't really know what to order, so many choices, and Billie working behind the counter gave me several suggestions. I  go with the smoked turkey sandwich and red beans & rice for my side. She let me sample the beans before I got them (just to make sure they weren't too spicy). When I sat down, she asked if I would like a sample of the pork. Of course I do!! And damn I should have ordered the pork because it was delicious! The smoked turkey was good too just not like the pork. The BBQ sauce they put on too is sweet and yummy!!   As I'm eating, Billie and another staff member come out and talk to me for about 20 minutes. Both are really cool, laid back people and enjoyed having some company (as I went in alone). The entire time I was there, nobody else came in so it was fun talking to the staff. Just want to point out they do get slammed for lunch and dinner but since 3PM on a Thursday is an odd time to eat, they weren't busy.   Definitely loved this place and will be returning!!

I've been to Vegas many times but never to Harley-Davidson...until this weekend. I must say, I am definitely a fan! Everyone in my party raved about their mac n' cheese so of course, I have to order it! It definitely lived up to the hype...OMG! SO good! I loved the motorcycle displays and staff was really attentive/friendly.  I would recommend for a cool/laid back place to eat on the strip!

I've never actually stayed here (have been many times though) but I wanted to review anyways for their amazing customer service! I made a reservation from 2/21 to 2/23 for my sister's bachelorette weekend. Reservations were easy to make and the person I spoke with was great. Unfortunately, there was a death in the family and we were unable to go on this trip :( :( :(  BUT, when I called the hotel and explained to them this madness, they were very understanding and gave me my full refund back on my deposit, despite the 48 hour cancellation notice requirement. I told the person I spoke with on the phone how deeply grateful I was for this understanding and would return when I come out next time. Now this is great customer service!!  I can't wait to stay here when it comes time to hit up Vegas again (which I sure hope it soon!)

I am a big fan of YC's! I love the wide variety of options for your bowl and the wonderful sauce options. I particularly like the soups, rice and chips with sweet and sour sauce!! I could eat bowl after bowl of those chips with sauce!!! I am literally getting hungry as I write this review...  I didn't give YC's 5 stars for 2 reasons. 1 is that their prices keep going up. I swear everytime I go the price for a bowl has gone up. I think the last time I was there for dinner a bowl was $11.50. The other reason is that you have to pay for a to-go box!! I think that is a total rip off!!!  Other than that, YC's is great and delicious. I would recommend for a filling lunch or dinner.

Chinese and mexican together?! Yes please! This place is really great and I can't believe tonight was my first time trying it!! Location is a little hidden but once you pass Dobson, it's clearly visible (turn right after Circle K). Restaurant is really large and staff was really friendly. Since it was my first time in, they let me sample a few of their menu items. I thought that was really cool! I ended up ordering the jade chicken (similar to sweet and sour), gringo chicken in a quesadilla with chicken fried rice and refried beans. We ordered to go and waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. When we got home, I was excited to try all the food! Quesadilla was amazing...jade chicken great, beans good and rice was OK. I LOVE that they give you a warm snicker doodle too! Cookie was really good and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, this place is great and will return soon!

I came here for dinner and HH with a friend, after hearing nothing but raving reviews about LGO! I actually drove past it the first time but was able to find it after a quick U-turn (legally of course!). The market is lovely with all kinds of things to look at, the bakery was stocked full of yummy goodies and breads galore! We were seated in the dining room and our waitress was very sweet and attentive.   After looking at the menu's, we noticed there wasn't much of a HH (only 2 wines for $5, $1 off cocktails and $2 beers). My friend and I ordered Sangria (OK I had 2) and thought it was quite tasty and full of fruit to nibble on afterwards. We split the smoked salmon salad, which was amazing! Perfect amount to split with someone because we also ordered the roasted corn pizza. Wow, the pizza was so good! I didn't think corn in a pizza would taste this good but it really does, as it was layered underneath the cheese and sourdough pie! Since we saw all the amazing bakery items beforehand, we had to order the Smore's cupcake (to split!). It was also incredible and rich, glad we split it!   I had a really great time and will be back! Delish!

I just want to shout out to Kristen M. at the corporate office, who contacted me after this review. She not only apologized but gave me another opportunity to try this location. I went on a week night and just ordered dessert. The pizooki was amazing and I was SO happy to have indulged in such heaven! THANK YOU Oregano's for your amazing customer service...much appreciated. Will be back for sure!!

This place is a lot of fun for big groups or just to go with a few friends. The last time I was here, it was my birthday and boy do they celebrate birthdays! I got asked to the stage (with a few other people who also were celebrating a birthday) to be played and sing along...it was super fun! Just a heads up, if you plan to go on the weekends after 10pm, it's always super crowded and there's a cover charge.   Buuuut, if you're looking for a fun (and a different) change of pace from the norm, this place is fun to visit. It's loud, entertaining and fun to sing along to the songs (that you know :)

Friday night date night and we ended up here, since the smells and sound of BBQ were too good to pass up. The line was quite long but only took about 15-20 minutes to get through. The set up is cafeteria style where silverware, trays, plates and drinks are first and you order next. My boyfriend got the meat platter but unfortunately, they were out of chicken and ribs! So it was a double order of chopped brisket and pulled pork. I ordered the 2 meat platter with turkey breast and jalapeño sausage. Sides we got were mac and cheese, cheesy potato, coleslaw, and potato salad. A piece of garlic/Texas toast comes with the meal and corn bread is $2.50 extra. Total with drinks was under $30, not bad for all the food we got! BF got the homemade root beer, which he loved! It does have quite a root beer kick though, from what I was told (I don't like root beer).   Seating is a plenty here, including outdoor seating. We picked a booth inside and started chowing away. The BBQ sauce was nice, it was tasty on the pulled pork and turkey. Surprisingly, my favorite meat was the jalapeno sausage, and I am NOT a fan of spicy things! It had just the right amount of spice and the sausage was unreal. Favorite side of the night (agreed unanimously) was the coleslaw! It was SO fresh, crunchy with a touch of sweetness. I swear I could eat an entire bowl of it. Mac and cheese was OK, cheesy potato was OK, potato salad was OK. The toast is nothing special, next time I will try the corn bread.   Overall, we liked the food and would return. I probably won't go on a weekend again so we can actually try the food we want before they run out and avoid long lines. We will be back!

We went here late one night for dinner because it was the only Mexican place open past 10PM. The bar was the only place available to sit down so we ordered drinks and got chips and salsa. I ordered the albondigas soup and a bean burro. The soup was extremely salty, too salty to the point where I told our waiter I wasn't able to eat it. The burro was OK, I only ordered it because it was on the a la carte menu and cheap. I will say the service was pretty fast and attentive but it still isn't saving it for me to return anytime soon.

I came here after seeing some Craigslist furniture ads with an adorable ottoman posted for sale here. First of all, I almost couldn't park because the parking lot is tiny and literally right off the street. I think I almost caused an accident by braking so fast just so I wouldn't pass it. I walked past another antique like store (Charlie's House) and then walked into Qcumberz. Holy blazes was it hot in there!!! I don't know if the AC wasn't working or if they enjoy it being 95 degrees with hot air blowing around by fans but I was NOT impressed with that! Not once was I greeted by anyone either...bah. The store itself is a good size but there's just so much "crap" everywhere! I think I've learned that this kind of vintage just isn't my cup of tea. Nothing struck a cord with me, just a bunch of stuff I could see at my grandma's garage sale. I did find the ottoman I was looking for and it was so tiny...and for $69! I was shocked how small it was...the close up pictures really make it appear larger. And, the color on the ottoman picture was also different in person (in pictures it was green, in store it was light blue). Major disappointment! Overall, I did not like this store and would not return.

This place is really close to my boyfriend's house so we decided to stop here one night to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. We were the only customers inside at the time but was impressed with how many choices they have as well as their beverage selection. We had a few samples, all fantastic! I honestly can't remember what I ordered but remember it being delicious! They have a lot of sorbets and fruit flavors too if that's more your style. Girls behind the counter were helpful and gave suggestions for flavor combinations. Oh and the place smells wonderful!! The waffle cone pieces they give you in your gelato are good too!  Will come back!!

Whoa, some of these reviews are mouth hanging open shocking to read! I've personally enjoyed every experience I've had here and will continue to return. Lunch time can be a bit crazy so just beware. Everything from the hummus, pitas and salads are delicious! I don't think I would call this place "Mediterranean" but it's good food. The tabouli salad I ordered today was gigantic and very tasty! All my co-workers who hadn't been before have loved it after a recommendation from myself. It can get a little pricey but to me isn't price difference wise to somewhere like Paradise Bakery. The food options are really good and I like that it's a healthier choice than some of the places around the area. I also love the Greek dressing they leave on the tables (which you can buy to take home as well). All in all, I am a fan and will keep returning!

I pass by this place everyday driving down Cooper/Stapley and decided on a whim to go for dinner one night with my boyfriend. It was very crowded when we arrived but the line wasn't long (thank God) but paid almost $30 for 2. Everything was categorized by stations so we started with the salad bar, which was closest to the booth in which we were seated. Everything looked fresh and dove right in, bringing back some Clam Chowder soup as well. No complaints with the salad bar, just needed to add some salt and pepper to the soup. Next we went around to the rest of the stations, where there were options of chicken, steak, ham, pizza, taco bar and assorted sides. Food looked like it had been sitting out for a long time and there were hardly any healthy options to choose from. When I came back and started eating, everything I ate was horrible. The chicken was extremely dry, the ham that was sliced to order was not moist and had this overly sweet and hard glaze to it. My boyfriend got a steak and he said for the cut of meat it was, which wasn't good, was cooked well and at least edible. We also tried the popcorn "shrimp" when we realized it wasn't actual shrimp. The taco "meat" was truly a mystery as well. Nothing had flavor and everything was so dry. Gross.  As for sides, the mashed potatoes were awful and the mac and cheese was mediocre at best. I didn't touch the pizza, as it looked nasty. My boyfriend and I did not finish our plates and debated just grabbing dessert and leaving. We walked to the dessert bar, where the options were a plenty but not too appetizing. The chocolate fountain with strawberries was the best thing I ate. The apple cobbler and peach cobbler were giant blobs of canned fruit disasters. We were still hungry so we went to grab more salad but when we walked back to the salad bar, everything was taken away and being cleaned with bleach. I wondered why they were bleach cleaning during the middle of rush hour dinner service...the smell permeated the entire area, which made wanting to eat even more unappealing. So, we scratched that idea.    Golden Corral, we tried to like you but you just make it very tough with your step below "cafeteria" style food. It was also very dirty inside and décor is very outdated, which makes the place seem even more dirty. Our server was also annoyingly loud and was singing to every song being played on the radio. Really, people don't want to hear your squealing during dinner. I couldn't wait to leave.

I love Costco! I'm not even a member here and I love coming (don't worry, I always come with members). It's busy on weekends (as expected) but slower on weeknights. Staff are friendly, food/drinks are cheap and I always spend way too much money here! On a side note, my boyfriend and I just bought our bedroom furniture set here and we are super impressed with the quality and price. Furniture stores are charging double or even triple what we paid for and we are completely happy with our purchase! I also like to browse Costco online to see what's not in store. So, I will happily keep returning, even if it's not this exact location!

I truly feel that this theatre is a gem! Ticket prices are cheaper than Harkins and AMC and it's a really nice theatre. They just re-modeled the parking lot and the complex around there so it's really nice to visit. The theatre itself is clean, nice AC and doesn't have as many people as Harkins. I've never had a problem here and come here often to avoid the crazy crowds at Tempe Marketplace. Plus, I live across the street so it's very close. It's definitely worth checking out!

I certainly am not one who enjoys the dentist but decided to give this place a try, as it is literally within walking distance of my home. Office staff is friendly, technicians are very gentle and pleasant and I really liked Dr. Kubota! I had my teeth cleaned and x-rayed on my first visit and did the Zoom teeth whitening on the second visit. Dr. Kubota answered all my questions and gave me great referrals for wisdom tooth extraction. I also enjoyed the fun decorations of the office and the TV/Movie options to watch while you're stuck in the chair. I would definitely recommend Harmony Dental and have since referred someone!

My husband and I finally went to this place on a Friday evening. It wasn't busy at all. We waited several minutes at the hostess stand before anyone even acknowledged us and showed us to a table. Their sign clearly says "please wait to be seated" or else we might have sat ourselves. Once we were seated, it took another 10 minutes for a waitress to take our drink and food orders. We started with the egg rolls, which were clearly frozen egg rolls they just put in the fryer. My husband ordered the mango beef and I ordered the chicken fried rice. Food came out quickly- mine was better than his but we both said the meats were not fresh and tasted like they were re-heated from being frozen. Very underwhelemed with the service and food. We will definitely not be returning.

I've dined in twice and have ordered take out from here many times as this place is about 5 minutes from my home. It's cool this joint was featured on DDD and has some decorations from the occasion inside. My personal favorites are the baked ziti pizza, antipasto salad and chicken & eggplant parmesan. The garlic knots are also really good when you eat in! Very casual inside but the food is pretty good. We will keep returning!

I've eaten at some Middle Eastern type deli's and bakeries before and this one does not disappoint! Nestled in between Thomas and Osborn off 16th street, turn in the small parking lot with lots of painted colors on the store front windows. The store was fun to look around, definitely won't find these items at your local Fry's. I walked up to the counter to order and was greeted by a smiling man. I ordered a small hummus with wheat pita, the chicken gyro pita sandwich and a lemonade. I didn't feel like eating a huge plate of food for lunch..maybe next time? Seating is a little tight and not many tables for small parties. I was lucky to snag a small table near the dessert case and waited about 10 minutes for food to arrive. Hummus was good but obviously came right out of the fridge. Pita was good, just wished it would have been warmed up. The sandwich was also good and the yogurt sauce inside was amazing! Apparently you only get a side of it when you order a plate, not a sandwich...bummer! The hyped up lemonade is nice and sweet. As I was getting up to leave, the owner came up to me and asked if I'd like a refill on my drink. Of course! He knew exactly what I had too...very nice! I wish they had other desserts though, since I do not like baklava and that was the majority of what they had. However, I will definitely return!

I went here for my sister's birthday as a new place to try after hearing about it on the Food Network channel. The vibe of the place is really special and unique, feels like you're at a private farm. The food was amazing!! I decided to order a salad just so I could sample all the home grown veggies from the farm. The strawberry lemonade was also top notch and came in a very large cup! After lunch, we walked around the fields and visited the coffee shop next door. The only negatives for me was the really long wait time (almost an hour) at 2pm in the afternoon on a weekday and how far of a drive it was for me. Overall, great experience...would go back!

I came here for lunch today- I think I drove past the complex it's in twice because it's so hard to find. To save you some trouble if you haven't been before, it's on the NW corner of Indian School and 32nd St. The lunch hour was pretty busy here but did enjoy the lunch special (1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad with chips and a small cookie). I did notice all their pastries and desserts too but didn't get one after my meal because I didn't want to wait in line. I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich, which was great, and the chopped salad, which was also great. I also noticed they have breakfast options until 11AM.   I'm glad I checked this place out!

I don't crave cupcakes often but when I do, I go to Sprinkles. Location is great, right off Scottsdale Road and Camelback. Lines can get long though (just means it's THAT good) so I wouldn't suggest coming if you're in a huge hurry. The staff there is really what makes my review 5 stars! Every single person I have ever encountered at Sprinkles is none other than friendly, sweet, accommodating and truly customer service orientated. I've seen some extremely rude, disrespectful people in there and am truly appalled at how they treat these amazing staff members! They will truly go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience so don't treat them like dirt! End rant.  So, about the cupcakes. I am pretty sure I have tried most of the flavors (even the seasonal) and would recommend the following: black and white, cinnamon sugar, chai latte, chocolate peppermint (seasonal), vanilla milk chocolate and the bailey's one around St. Patty's day. As you can tell, I like my chocolate! I really haven't had a bad cupcake to be honest. I mean at $3.50 a pop, it better be good! They also sell some of the flavors for cake mixtures in store...mhm!! I also love how they will create a dozen box for you on most special occasions (birthdays, anniversary's, thank you, congratulations, etc.) They also do wedding cupcakes!!   For every Sprinkles location I have been to, I have received top notch service and product. The cupcake ATM is also a unique touch too and hope Scottsdale gets one soon! Sprinkles is amazing and you should at least stop once if you haven't already!

I live in the area and come to this mall only if I need to do some quick shopping. The mall seems small because there's not much to do there. Many of the stores are vacant and there are very few "name brand" stores. They don't have a movie theatre there anymore (the one nearby shutdown) and the food court is nothing special. I usually spend about 2 hours there, tops. There is a pretty nice kids area and a lot of kids were playing so that is a big draw for families with little ones. Overall, I wouldn't expect much coming here. It's not the worst mall I've ever been to but I much prefer Scottsdale Fashion Square and Chandler Mall, even though both are somewhat of a drive for me.

One of the nicest bowling alleys I've been to- it's actually updated and not old/smelly like other places. It does get really busy here so be prepared to arrive early or wait. We came here on a Sunday night and was around $10 a person for 3 hours of bowling and shoes. My fiancé and I are actually looking to join a bowling league here too, since it's nice and close to our house!

Su Vino is one of my favorite places in Old Town and my favorite wine bar! I have been here many times with friends and just to order wine for parties and special occasions. For the price, the wine tasting is well worth it! If you become a Su Vino Club Card Member, they will send you coupons for free wine tastings so it's definitely worth it. Even people who don't enjoy wine will find at least one flavor they like. Summer Rain is very refreshing and fruity, perfect for someone who doesn't know wine well or just wants something delicious. Peachy Keen and Blueberry Breeze are also amongst my personal favorites. Their chocolate wine is also fantastic!!!  Highly recommended for groups or even on a date. It's classy, friendly and fun. I have recommended this place to many friends and they all love it. 5+ stars for Su Vino!

This place is off the chain!! We stopped here after hearing nothing but amazing things and were already there checking out the Miracle Mile shops. The line was a little long but worth the wait! I honestly don't think this place is ever dead because it's open 24 hours and has great food!  I ordered the "all american" sandwich and the tomato bisque soup. My boyfriend ordered the chicken chipotle sandwich, which apparently is a limited time only sandwich. Priced fairly well for Vegas (around $6 a sandwich) and we both referred to the size of the sandwiches being like a brick. Both of us loved the portion and freshness of the sandwich, made to order, and I loved my soup! The soup has homemade croutons inside and the sandwich had all my favorites (turkey, lettuce, tomato, cheese) and also cranberries! It added a sweetness to the sandwich but very good toasted with the other ingredients. My boyfriend's sandwich was also good, the chipotle sauce giving the chicken a nice flavor.   I'm a little sad I won't be able to find one of these back home in AZ but am hopeful for the day it makes it here! Definitely check this place out when you're hungry and in Vegas baby!

I've wanted to try this place out for a while but never did because it's a bit of a drive from the East Valley. But, I had the opportunity to dine here tonight with my boyfriend for a nice dinner out. Since it's a Friday night, we did have to wait but decided a nice drink at the bar would be a good idea. The bar is pretty big and the bartenders are very friendly. Full service bar too so if you don't want to wait, that's an option. The couple we sat next to are regulars of the restaurant and raved about the food before we even sat down to eat. The restaurant itself is very vibrant and nice. The decor is a little outdated but still comfortable. You can dress up or be casual.  When we got our table, we were greeted by a friendly waitress. We were immediately served bread and continued to have great service throughout the night. If our waitress didn't get to us, there were many other staff available to get drinks, napkins, bring out food, etc. When I asked to sample the gumbo, they were more than happy to bring out a sample. It tasted great with the bread! I decided to eat light and went with the mussles whereas my boyfriend ate the mahi alexander. He loved it! Big portions but also a big price tag.   For good seafood, this place is amazing. They also have a nice outdoor patio and on a nice night, it's nice to sit out and eat. They also have a live band on the weekends too. Overall, this place is great and will definitely return!

I've been to San Tan Brewery a few times and have had good expeiences overall. My favorite beer is the Mr. Pineapple! One of the best beers I have ever had in my entire life!!! The food is also good and offers a lot of variety. I particularly like the daily selection choices. My favorite dish has been the street tacos. Staff is also very friendly and has a good overall vibe.

I've been to Benihana a couple times before but never to this location. I received my $30 off birthday coupon so we came in on a Thursday night. I actually have to use my birthday coupon early because it expires before my actual birthday! What a riot..   Service was slow but our server was very nice- our chef was really disappointing to be completely honest. You could barely understand him- he really wasn't a showman at all and couldn't cook the food well! The scallops were torched, meats were overcooked. The best thing I ate that night was the Rainbow Roll- which was very fresh! The white peach saki sangria was also tasty! We decided to leave before dessert (take it to go) because I ended up not feeling well half way through the night.   Oh and on top of a $30 off coupon, we still didn't get out of there without spending close to $100. Medicore food for a very expensive price tag.  I think I'm done with Benihana.

Kabuki is my favorite sushi restaurant. The restaurant is nice, clean and lively. Happy hour is very reasonable to go for the rolls and drink specials, although regular menu prices aren't overpriced. I love getting their Dynamite roll and their Philly roll. I've even taken friends here that don't like sushi and they are able to find something to eat here. The chicken teriyaki is also delicious for those who don't enjoy sushi.  I would definitely recommend for sushi and an overall nice meal. I live very close to this place and love their sushi so I will keep coming back!!

I came here about a month ago and am kicking myself as to why I haven't gone sooner?! Not only is this store so cute, it's really a great salon for an affordable-ish amount. This is definitely the place you want to go with your girlfriends or like others have posted, some sort of special occasion. I would suggest making an appointment because they are crazy busy! I really enjoyed the technician who did my nails and decided to treat myself to a spa pedicure and gel manicure. I liked that I got to choose the scrub and lotion for my massage. The pedicure is still on my toes (mind you I have had to trim the nails since then) but still looks pretty decent after a month! The gel manicure lasted maybe 5 days. I'm much more a pedicure girl anyways! So, if you're looking for a new place to try or your new place to get your nails done, I'd suggest Pink Polish!

As a relatively new resident of Gilbert, I am always looking for new places to try. Black bear diner caught my interest and finally came here on a Sunday during brunch hours. Not the best time of day to go (long wait) but we finally got in and seated. The décor is adorable. I love diners and this place has all the typical diner stuff and more! We started with a cherry bearclaw and wow was it tasty! Breakfast came with HUGE portions. Service was attentive and good.  As we went to the front to pay, the chocolate cream pie looked too good to pass up so I took one home for a dinner dessert. Pie was good served cold, not room temp.  I will definitely come back here!

As far as bowling alleys go, it's a pretty average looking place. They do have a pretty cool cafe with pool tables and TV's as well as a snack bar. What I do like about this place is it's clean and staff are very friendly. I come here for my boyfriend's bowling league and find it comfortable to hang out.I also do enjoy the fact there's no smoking inside. If you're looking for a good place to bowl, I'd go here!

Famous Dave's has been a family favorite dinner place since I moved to the Mesa Riverview area. We have enjoyed everything from a casual dinner to birthdays here. We always order the family platter, which is a massive amount of food! Their pork, brisket and ribs are the best! The cornbread is also great.  For around $70, you can feed 6 people and still have food to take home! The BBQ sauces are also tasty with the chips they bring out before the food. I like the sweet and tangy sauce the best.   The best part about Dave's BBQ is that they do FREE dinners for anyone named David or Dave on their anniversary. That's been a benefit for me since my dad is David and a good friend is Dave. Only thing I've ever had here that I wouldn't order again is the chocolate brownie dessert. The flavor of the brownie was off and I didn't enjoy it.  Good food, fun vibe and friendly staff here. Would recommend!

I fell in love with Culver's when I went in Wisconsin back in 2007. At the time, I had only tried the custard, which is absolutely divine! I went there a few times until I had to return home to Arizona. After a few years of patiently waiting, I found out Culver's was coming to Mesa! I was elated!!! Since then, I have expanded my pallete to their burgers, wraps and sides. I still think the custard is what makes this place special but their other food is good too. I love the fact that they have flavor of the day for custards. Totally amazing place and I would recommend to anyone who likes burgers, fries and custard.

I've been in a few times to get gift certificates but had not received services. I decided as a treat for my upcoming birthday, I would make an appointment for a pedicure. I arrived and was taken to a waiting area, with dimmed lighting, water and soft music playing in the background-very relaxing.  Shay came over and explained the pedicure process with me, as this was my first time. The 1 hr and 15 min pedicure started with a foot soak then was led to a private room. As I reclined in the zero gravity chair, Shay did an excellent job relaxing me and giving an unbelievable pedicure experience. If you're looking for the best pedicure, go here. It's pricey at $70 but I enjoyed every minute of it! Next time, I hope to book a massage!

After trying Binkley's, I wanted to try out their casual Cafe Bink. I've been here twice now and have had exceptional experiences both times. Service is attentive and prompt. Dylan W. was our server both times. He was great and would recommend! The food here is straightforward but made with exceptional ingredients. The last time I was here, I ordered the fries (which are awesome), a burger and a caesar salad. Everything was great! Fries came with a trio of sauces, including a garlic aioli and truffle ketchup. Caesar is made with homemade croutons and anchovies. I didn't think I liked anchovies but in the salad, they taste great. The burger was well made and delicious on the onion roll. For dessert, we tried the nutella creme brule, which was outstanding! It also came with chocolate chip cookies on the side. Yumm-o!!   It's a bit of a drive if you aren't already in North Scottsdale, Carefree or Cave Creek but well worth it! It's small inside, has a nice bar and a beautiful patio that has a great view of the mountains and desert scene. Prices are a bit high but food is great!  Will keep returning!

I came here without an appointment and was immediately greeted then taken over to the bar for my manicure. Salon was clean and lots of people were working that day! My nail stylist was friendly and spent quality time making sure my nails looked great. For $35, I got a great gel manicure with glitter detail, which is a much better price from what I have paid in other salons for gel and glitter. As a tip, they do not accept credit card gratuitity so make sure you have cash on hand. In case you are unaware or forget, there is an ATM located inside and doesn't charge an extra fee! If I'm in the area again and need/want my nails done, I will be sure to visit again!

I live in the area and shop in the Mekong plaza from time to time so I decided to check this place out for Pho. It's very casual, you can sit anywhere you like. It's a smaller restaurant with TV's around and tables for big groups and couples. I ordered my chicken pho to go and waited only 5 minutes (I didn't call ahead to order just walked in). Staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I waited. The pho itself is a very generous portion and for those that have never had it, it's like a soup on steroids! The broth is so fragrant and tasty...you add in the rice noodles, meat and veggies yourself.   I really liked this place and would recommend!

I LOVE cornish pasty!! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers (import and domestic). I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty (if you want them to be).  If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!

I used to think Tropicana was a dump but after the remodel, the place looks great! It looks really clean and modern inside, definitely a place you want to hang out.  Our party checked out the pool and had a great time! Good size pool, swim up blackjack, bar..I mean what else could you ask for? Food options looked amazing (I didn't eat here but saw all the places). A couple of friends had a room here and the room was also very nicely remodeled! Love gambling here for the cheap tables but looks nothing like before...go check it out! I think I might stay here next time I'm in Vegas!

I've had the delight of trying this ice cream twice and I am definitely a fan. The first sample I received was at the Taste of Ocotillo event, where I tried the nutella flavor. I was hooked after that so I searched up their location and found out they are pretty close to where I live! I went in on a random weeknight, where I was the only one inside, but was able to chat it up with the staff and get recommendations. They have TONS of flavors but ended up with a 2 scoop of hazel "nutty" and their super farm. I just went on their website and discovered even MORE flavors to try, including avocado, girl scout cookie, toasted marshmallow, potato chip?! They also sell a variety of butters, which I will probably try next time.  Check this one out!

I don't live near Silver Mine anymore (tear) but do love their sandwiches! I actually crave these guys and love their punch card system. I can't tell you how many times I've earned a free sub! If you're a dessert person, their brownies and cookies hit the spot! Plus, who can complain about delivery AND staying open late, and I mean 3AM late! They also offer soup, chips, potato salad and a pickle for side options. Simple and delicious, can't complain!

I wouldn't usually come to this area to eat but was in a hurry and wanted something other than taco bell. The menu online is completely different than when you walk in but so was everything else. Service was friendly and food came out relatively quickly but this place just gave me the creeps. There were flies flying around, place was almost dead during the lunch hour and just wasn't clean. I also didn't feel like I should have been in there...like a fish out of water. I ate my ham torta and undercooked fries quickly, just so I can get out of there. I will say the bread that the torta was on was really amazing! If I could just get that to go, I would come back. For everything else, no thank you.

If you're looking for a cute-sy place to try at a great location on the Strip (in front of Caesar's Palace) this place should make your list. Yes it's expensive and probably overpriced but what place on the Strip isn't? The wait is pretty crazy but, I did get a kick ass table outside on the patio with an amazing view and great service! The frozen hot chocolate was amazing, lets be honest, but I couldn't come close to finishing it because the drink is so huge! My friend and I had a fun time chatting, enjoying our beverage/dessert and being on the strip. I would come back for sure!!

I have given this place 3 chances to get it right for me and unfortunately, they struck out! I think the service is attentive yet their employees are annoying and try too hard to keep a conversation. I appreciate the "Hi, how's your day going?" but these guys just take it to another level...and not one I'm comfortable with I guess. I do not like the fact it is drive thru only and that you can't go in and sit down. Isn't that what a coffee shop is supposed to be? Most importantly, I just do not like their product.  I have tried 2 of their infusion teas and their chai tea latte. The first tea I tried was a green tea mixed with blackberry and pomegranate syrups. I thought it was very watered down and didn't taste sweet enough. The second tea was also a green tea but had raspberry and pomegranate syrups. This tea was too sweet and just not good. I went again and decided to get their chai tea, which is my favorite tea, and was extremely underwhelemed. It tasted like their was NO chai tea at all, absolutely no spice whatsoever...all I could taste was the milk and maybe a little honey. Honestly, it was the worst chai tea latte I've ever had!   Maybe if I only wanted a cup of coffee, this place would do it for me. But, I don't like coffee and like trying coffee shops for their teas and lemonades. Overall, this place just doesn't impress me at all and I would much rather spend my money at Starbucks or a local coffee shop.

Out of all the popular fro-yo places, Yogurtland is surely the best! I have never had a bad experience and come here often. The flavors are diverse and delicious! I personally go for any chocolate, graham cracker, pistachio or any flavors in that family. The toppings bar is also really fresh and always stocked with plenty of goodies! You can get anything from fresh fruit to candy to cereal to sauce. The staff is also very friendly and sample cups are always available upon arrival. Prices are reasonable unless you fill up your cup with a lot (like myself). For two normal size cups, my boyfriend and I usually spend around $10. Great location, right off the 202 inside a complex with In and Out and Starbucks. Overall, this place is amazing and I will keep coming back!

I've passed this store many times but decided to take a look inside today. Staff is very friendly and will tell you more about the store. They were doing a fundraiser for Red Cross and if you donated (literally pocket change), you could receive 20% for items 10 days or older and more for items 30 days and older. The dates are located on the tag so you also know how long an item has been in the store. Items include handmade jewelry and "gently used" clothing items including shoes, purses and belts. I was happy to see such an array of sizes, including plus sizes. The store itself isn't huge but they do have it laid out well. I noticed a lot of the clothes came from Banana Republic so mostly name brand here. I did end up buying a cream colored shawl for $14. As a tip, some of the clothes did have signs of significant wear and small holes so look over clothes really carefully.  I liked this store mostly for the customer service and staff- they are really helpful and great! I would come back to check out what else has come in but I personally didn't find much my first visit to try on or even buy. May be a hit or miss type of place.

This place is pretty legit. They have delicious and unique flavors that are good to enjoy alone or blended with another flavor. The prices are pretty reasonable as well. I would recommend this place for sure!

Yogurtland is my favorite frozen yogurt place. They always have great yogurt choices and they have the best toppings! I love coming here for a nice treat. Their bowls are big and you can take whatever you don't eat home. I usually scarf mine but that's because I love yogurt!!  The only negative is the parking can be limited depending on the time of day you go. Other than that, it's a nice place with great yogurt. I even like their water with the strawberries, which is complimentary. Expect to pay around $5-$10 for yogurt, depending on how much you put in your bowl. Not really cheap but definitely delicious!

I went here today for the first time with a friend and I really enjoyed the "betty boop". It came with one big waffle and a chicken thigh. The waffle was good, tasted like cinnamon, and the chicken was juicy and delicious! I also ordered a rasberry kool-aid just because it was available and I enjoyed that as well! I loved how quick we got the food and how attentive the servers were, even the host was great!   I would come back for the chicken and waffles but also to try their "soul food".

I would really give 3.5 stars but decided to be generous with 4. We went on a weeknight and were seated right away. Place has trivia to play on your phone so my boyfriend loved that and it was fun to play a game while eating/drinking. Our servers were pleasant and nice, chips and salsas came out right away. Love the chips and salsa, as well as the homemade bean dip! I could eat an insane amount of these!   The menu has a lot of options to choose and I went with the chicken fajitas. Food came out quick and was hot! I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning that was cooked with the fajitas, a little spicy for my taste. Rice and beans were delicious, too bad they charge an extra $1.25 for sour cream and guacamole. The margarita was also really good but $10.   I haven't been on taco Tuesday but am interested in checking it out!

I cannot begin to express how much I love this place! Up until recently, I had only picked up gifts here but now, I have some balsamic vinegars and oils to try for myself! Taste away here and have employees mix flavors for you to try, it is so delicious! Bottles range from $16-18 a piece but will last a long time! Outrageous is tucked in a small shopping quarter across from Rusty Spur Saloon and next to Del Sol. Walk around and stumble upon this gem and discover new inspirations for cooking or gifts! Will keep returning!

We tried this place out on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. While we waited for our table, we sat outside on the patio with our drinks. The patio space was nice and had additional tables for people to sit and eat. Since it was a warm night, we decided to eat inside. We were seated right in front of the stage at a long table. As the night worn on and got more packed, sitting at this table wasn't exactly ideal because so many people were standing behind us from the bar and bumping into our chairs. It was also pretty dark inside so I did have trouble reading the menu (that's what the flashlight app on your smart phone is for I guess). The ambience of the restaurant was very impressive with the purple tile walls and huge chandeliers. It reminded me of Vegas?  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful on drink and food choices. Our table started with the kettle chips and pretzels with provolone fondue. Ummm just have to say, the pretzels and fondue were fantastic!!! Huge hit at our table and we are still raving about them days after we ate them! The chips were also good.  I decided to split the chopped vegetable salad and sweet corn canelloni with my boyfriend. The chopped vegetable salad was a nice light note with a ton of vegetables and worked well with our entree, the sweet corn canelloni. The canelloni was really good but if you're hungry, I wouldn't recommend splitting it. For us, we knew it was going to be a night of drinking so we didn't want to over-do it. Perfect amount for the occasion. I stuck with my usual white wine for the night but many of my friends ordered speciality cocktails. I was able to try a couple and thought they were strong but good.   As we were leaving, the band came in and started playing. We could hear them through the loud speakers on the patio and they sounded pretty good, playing a few cover songs from popular pop/rock singers. It was definitely a fun place to go for a friday night and would return.

I would never have thought to stop here if it wasn't for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses but I am sure glad it was on the list to go! Velvet is a cozy store with cute clothes, accessories and very friendly staff! I personally didn't buy anything here but my shopping buddy found a few Christmas gifts for her nieces. They did have a shawl piece, which can be worn many ways, but was a little out of my price range at $48. Once I obtain a little more spending money, I will be sure to return!

I would never come back and I would never recommend this salon to anyone!! My sister and I went in for mani's and Pedi's on my birthday and somehow it took almost 3 hours for us to get both done! The day we went they were not busy, there were only 4 technicians working so we ended up having to wait about 30 minutes with our feet in cold water before our pedicures began. Both of our technicians were nice but not good at what they do. My gel manicure started peeling off in a few days and my pedicure looked terrible that I ended up going to another salon a week later to get another one because I couldn't stand looking at the terrible pedicure any longer! I wish I would have went to another salon but now I know to avoid this place like the plague...

This was my first experience with Hawaiian Airlines and I honestly couldn't imagine flying another airline to and from Hawaii. We had 4 flights with them on our recent Hawaiian stay as we flew from Phoenix to Honolulu, Honolulu to Kahului, Kahului to Honolulu and then Honolulu to Phoenix. Staff are very friendly and accommodating. On our last flight home, my husband sat in front of a jerk who kept kicking his seat and calling him rude names under his breath and the staff were able to move us both to new seats and gave us free drinks. The meals on the flights were also great and the snacks were very Hawaiian, which I liked. The rum punch we got on our flight to Honolulu was very tasty too. We did have to pay $25 bag fee for each flight but that's common nowadays.   All in all, I would definitely fly with Hawaiian again!

Angel Touch Nails is nowhere near my house but I came with my sister, who had a gift certificate, to get our nails done together. On a Saturday, there were maybe 5 people there. Also, there was no AC just a couple fans blowing around so it was really warm inside. They do give you a bottle of water so that helps cool you off a little. Somehow, I waited 10-15 minutes for someone to do my pedicure after my sisters had already started. My pedicure was very nice (hot stone) but she did not properly clip my nails. My manicure was the biggest disappointment, it started chipping after 1 day! She also made me bleed, which is never a good sign. I paid $64 (with tip) for a good pedicure and a horrible manicure. I would not return.

I've been here once and thought it was so-so. I'm not sure how often I would be running back to eat here but I did leave with leftovers because this place gives you an ENORMOUS bowl of food! I also tried the thai boba tea, which I didn't love. If I'm in the area, I'd much rather check out four peaks (which is a block away) rather than this place, just sayin.

How is it that I've NEVER heard of this place or hadn't eaten here before?! My boyfriend and I were driving past Warner one evening craving Italian and saw Riga Tony's sign. We looked it up on Yelp in the car and saw really great reviews so we decided to stop in! We came in late (9pm) but were seated right away. I loved the small store set up when you walk in and the dining areas that are decorated with really tacky art deco. Furniture was a bit dated but clean. Our waiter was very prompt and attentive. We were offered samples of wine, antipasto salad table side and a plate of bread. The salad was so good, the strips of salami were unreal and so was the homemade vinaigrette! The bread was sliced and fragrant, no breadsticks here! Olive oil is provided at each table for dipping. My boyfriend ordered the special for the evening (Seafood Linguini) and I ordered the Penne Sausage Rosa. By the time food came out, we were so excited to see huge plates of amazing food in front of us! My pasta was so good, especially the rosa sauce! My boyfriend loved the plentiful amount of scallops in his pasta as well as the shrimp! Of course we couldn't eat all of our food so we took it home to enjoy the next day. We walked out feeling full and all for under $40 (for 2). Next time, I will be ordering more of everything to enjoy table side and at home! Yum yum, would totally recommend!!!

This place is off the hook! I have eaten here many times and have loved everything I have tried. Couple of things though: 1. If you come here, expect to wait in line. There are no reservations so come early if you don't want to wait or wait for a long time. 2. This place is not a true "restaurant style" space. It's literally a section off the casino floor that you might think looks good but don't want to wait in line. WAIT IN LINE. Trust me! The gumbo is why I come here. You can order it spice level 0-10 and trust me, it packs a punch!! Portions are huge and extremely satisfying! I love this food so much! To me, there is nothing like this in Arizona (or nothing I know of) and is definitely worth a try. Come here with friends or on a date, it's a great restaurant. Plus, you're already inside Talking Stick so enjoy the casino, music or dance clubs upstairs afterwards. Boom, there's your next fun night out already planned!

I've gone here twice and had good experiences both times. Service is a litle slow so I wouldn't come here if you are in a hurry. But, what I would recommend is to come here and enjoy the extreme deliciousness that is Chompies.  I've had the Jewish sliders (which are incredible!), the knish, cheese blintz, pastrami sandwich and the chicken matzo ball soup. MUST HAVE THE MATZO BALL SOUP!! I did feel quite full after sharing a large bowl though so prepare for a lot of soup. The knish I had was the potato and onion. I liked it but it was very one note after a while. I had a few bites of my boyfriends mile high pastrami sandwich on challah bread and it was divine!! The challah bread was sweet and amazing and the pastrami was perfect! The blintz is a good sweet dish but also savory. Probably wouldn't come here if you are on a diet.  Prices are decent, decor is cool and the bakery walking in/out is amazing. They also serve Dr. Brown, which is great soda if you've never had it. Good food, good location, good experiences. Will be back!

First of all, I'm pretty sure this place is closed. Not just closed but no longer in business. I drove by recently and saw the signs in the window "For Lease". Based on my last experience at Luke's, I know why. I've been to Luke's many times before and always had solid food. The customer service is minimal at best but nothing bad to report per say. I raved and raved about this place to my boyfriend and so we finally stopped by one night. He ordered the Italian beef and it was literally the driest meat I've ever seen/tasted. It did not appear the meat had been soaked in anything and the sandwich was so dry! I was so disappointed he got this sandwich because I've tried their Italian beefs before and they were good. I don't know if they stopped caring because they know they were going to close down or if they forgot to soak the meat. So, I now have a different opinion of Luke's, especially since Portillo's are popping up nearby.

I've been here several times and only eaten at the bar but this weekend, I sat in the dining room for a nice meal with my boyfriend. We walked in around 8:30PM on a Saturday night and didn't wait, although the dining room was pretty full. The booth was very spacious, could have easily fit 4-6 people. Chips and salsa were quick to arrive and the salsa is really amazing! Our waitress took our drink orders and was surprised when she said I couldn't have sugar around the rim of my margarita glass. Hmm...never encountered that one before. Margaritas were delicious though and only $4! We each had 2, they were kinda small. For dinner, I ordered chicken fajitas and my boyfriend ordered a burro with rice and beans. Our food came pretty quick and was really delicious! The fajitas came with different types of bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. Really good! The sour cream is also a little different, but good! Service was prompt, nothing over the top though. I would definitely recommend Matta's for good Mexican food!

I came here on a Saturday night to watch an ASU game and have a nice dinner. It's located right off Scottsdale Road, easily visible from the street. There was no wait when we came (around 8PM) but very packed. We were seated at a bar top and were quickly greeted by our waiter. I decided to order a raspberry margarita, which was pretty good. I do prefer margaritas on the rocks and this one was frozen. I ordered a caesar salad to start and the chicken alfredo. The alfredo pasta came with rotini noodles, which I liked but reminded me slightly of a macaroni and cheese. The portion was HUGE though, definitely share or plan to take a lot home! Everything was good, the place has a bunch of TV's and the bar area with the TV on was really loud. If you don't like to watch sports while eating/drinking, I probably wouldn't come here. But, if you don't mind it or like it, it's a fun place to check out.   Overall, I had a good time and would recommend.

First of all, who doesn't love a 24 hour drive thru?? I tried this place after hearing nothing but amazing things to test it out for myself. I tried the chocolate sprinkles, glaze and devils food cake donuts. They were all amazing!! I was also pleasantly surprised to find out they have boba teas as well. Next time I go, I will be trying one of those too!

Huge transformation!! I remember the Pavilions movies theatre growing up as a staple place to go for movies. Once the economy went downhil, so did this theatre..until now!I've been twice since they re-opened. I went to see a G rated movie and an R rated movie. In the G movie, we took some time to visit the bar beforehand and grab a drink. For the R movie, we had someone give us a menu and come to us in the theatre to grab our drink and food order. I couldn't believe I could have a glass of wine and watch a movie in a theatre! I was in heaven!  The seats and theatre itself were very comfortable and clean. I loved both experiences here and will be returning! I wasn't bothered by the prices for the movie since movie tickets nowadays are ridiculous. I'd rather pay the same or a little more for an experience like this than go to a regular theatre. Well worth it!!

I have nothing but good things to say about Yume!! I have recommended this place to many people and everyone has said they love it, including me!  A friend introduced me to this place about a year ago. The restaurant itself is tiny but the food is awesome!! You can custom create your own rolls (which I have yet to find at other sushi places) and every roll I've had on the menu is amazing! I love the atmosphere of sitting up at the bar (the guys behind the counter are hysterical and great to talk to) while you wait for sushi.   I would recommend going during happy hour for the cheaper prices. I've also had some of their main dishes aside from sushi and those are delicious too.   Yume is my favorite "hole in the wall" sushi place and I will keep coming back!!

To celebrate our anniversary, my boyfriend and I decided to go somewhere nice for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated as soon as we arrived. The booth they gave us was very spacious. Our server was very attentive and we continued to recieve great service throughout our dining experience. We were there about two hours so it's definitely a "dining experience".   For an appetizer, we had to try this table side mozzarella because we kept hearing such amazing things! The server who made it was really friendly and showed us "newbies" what it was all about. We got to choose what kind of salt we wanted and if we wanted oil. We chose the Hawaiian salts, which were great! I would definitely say the mozzarella was the hit of the night for us! For dinner, I ordered the swordfish and my boyfriend ordered the short rib. Both were very delicious and would recommend! We took the chocolate cake with raspberry sauce home with us to share. The cake was very rich but good! Overall, I would recommend Tanzy. For us, it was definitely an indulgence (food and money wise) but we enjoyed out time at the restaurant.

We had a gift card- went in around noon on a Sunday. If you don't want to wait, I would suggest coming a little later. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes, not too bad. We were seated a large booth that could easily fit 5 (there were 2 of us) but was nice and roomy. Decor is modern and some of the design aspects were interesting yet weird (ie: only seeing part of the kitchen, large communal table). We started off with drinks- the honey bee was nice with honey vodka, cranberry juice and ginger ale. Beer selections range from local breweries (San Tan and 4 Peaks) to domestics.   Our waitress was very attentive and service was very good here. I ordered the Cali Benedict, which came with 2 poached eggs, bacon, avocado, tomato and hollandaise. My fiancé ordered the BLD burger with sweet potato fries. The BLD burger was GIANT and came with 2 beef patties, green chile pork, onion straws and a poached egg. The Benedict was good, eggs poached perfectly, the homemade potatoes were OK. The best part of the burger was the green chile pork...mmm!! Onion straws and beef patties were over cooked. One thing I did notice is some tables seated after us did get their food before us- which is something mentioned in other reviews. It wasn't a big deal for us as we were enjoying our Sunday brunch meal.  All in all, we liked this place and would return.

I am a big fan of Vietnamese food and decided to come here during my lunch hour. The restaurant is built inside a house and is super adorable, even with a walkway to the front door! I walked in and was immediately greeted and was told to sit anywhere. I chose the bar and was immediately given a glass of water and a menu. Service was very friendly and helpful, since this was my first time in I had no idea what to order (other than Pho). I ordered an Ahi tuna spring roll and it was so fresh and fabulous! The miso ginger sauce is really tasty and a great way to start off a meal.   Next was a half bowl of pho ga and came out really quickly. I've had pho from many places and this one while not being the best, was still tasty. It was the right amount, but could have done with more meat! I decided to give this place a real test and ordered dessert, since I can't drink on the clock. The only dessert they had was a ginger crème Brule, which I wasn't super into but decided to order anyways. The Brule part was very overdone and the crème was a little too gingery for my liking. For $7, not worth it.  I left full and will return when I get another craving!

I've been twice and bought a great bag today! I got a Michael Kors satchel for under $100, including tax. The saleswoman was nice without being pushy. For those who haven't been, the bags they sell are either returns or display models from large chain department stores (Bloomingdales, Macy's, Lord and Taylor). Some have slight tears or blemishes but the bag I bought today has nothing wrong with it! Selection is really nice and I am really happy with my purchase. The ONLY thing I didn't respond well to was the fact that they have a computer and a reciept printer in store but my transaction was all done on a cell phone. I was also told my reciept would be texted to me and it never was. Other than that, I would totally recommend! Store is also located in a great shopping complex so go check it out if you haven't already!

I went here tonight for dinner with a friend. The menu was really limited and for being a burger place, they only had 6 burgers to choose from. 5 of the 6 options were out for me because I do not enjoy spicy toppings or bacon. I ended up getting the original coal burger and essentially "creating my own" toppings. When we got our food, I was surprised at how thin and small the burger actually was (I got the 1/3 lb) and my friend got the 1/2 pound. His burger was slightly thicker than mine. The food was OK but nothing special. We ordered the mixed fries, which in my opinion were the best thing we ate there. I also would not recommend ordering their soda to anyone who is used to Coke or Pepsi products because they make all their soda in house using cane sugar. My diet coke tasted nothing like diet coke.  For 2 burgers, 2 drinks and a mixed order of fries, our bill was almost $25. To me, it was overpriced and not that great. I will not be coming here again nor will I be recommending them to anyone.

I really wish I could give this place a better review, since I see it has many raving reviews, but I just didn't have that great of an experience. I love trying new places and I especially love a good sandwich so I purchased a Groupon for lunch and decided since it was close by, I'd check it out. I liked that it was in downtown Mesa and had a cute concept with the whole picnic theme so I was looking forrward to something a little different. Parking is pretty limited, I got a spot on the side of the building but there wasn't a whole lot of other places to park other than the street.  It wasn't very busy during the lunch rush but I still waited about 20 minutes to get my food. I only ordered the caprese sandwich and a fruit cup so I was surprised it took as long as it did since they aren't actually cooking anything I ordered, just putting it together. Then, when I saw the size of my fruit cup, my jaw dropped open. It was literally the size of a cup you put ketchup or another condiment inside. I think total there were two pieces of strawberry and a few grapes. Sorry but if I didn't have a Groupon, I would have went up to the counter and asked for my money back on that alone! Then, when I tasted the sandwich, it really wasn't anything special.  I remember leaving disappointed and didn't feel like it was a good value at all. I also felt like the menu is pretty limited and there really wasn't a lot on there I would be interested in eating (and I am by no means a picky eater). Overall, not a place I enjoyed.

I had the most beautiful bridal shower at Arcadia Farms in their Hacienda room! The ONLY somewhat negatives are that the room is across from the actual restaurant and parking can be a bit of a challenge. The room, service and food were absolutely amazing for my tea party themed shower. Service was attentive, food was delicious (especially the desserts) and the space was nice and cool on a warm day. I would totally recommend having a private party here and going across the street and eating at the actual restaurant. Perfect!

This was my first time in and didn't really know what to expect. I guess I was going to compare it to YC's but it's really not the same. Genghis is a sit down restaurant where you create your own bowl, add sauce and they cook for you. I liked the selection of proteins, veggies and the array of sauces. I had someone helping me on all my selections and really enjoyed being able to sample sauces. When I got to the cooking station, I liked that you could add extra ingredients (I chose an egg). Service here was really great and I enjoyed my bowl!   I would definitely come back!

I came here during HH, which is everyday from 3-6pm. We walked in and sat near the bar, which had high top tables, floor to ceiling windows, and even plants growing along the windowsills. I thought bugs might be a problem but not one showed up anytime during our visit.  Our waitress handed us menus and told us all food items are on HH and certain beers are only $1! And, when I checked in on Yelp, I recieved an offer for a free beer shot! They have over 60 beers on tap so lots of classics, local brews and more! In addition, I also ordered a Moscow Mule, which did NOT come in a copper mug :(  After drinks came, we ordered food. I ordered a turkey club on cibatta with house made chips and my friend ordered the cilantro shrimp pizza. Food came out and was delicious. Service overall was fine, I really liked the restaurant and food. Even though we weren't here during the evening hours to hear music, Copper Blues is definitely somewhere I want to check out again!

I've been coming here for about six months and everything here is great! Staff is friendly and very easy to work with if you need to change or cancel an appointment. It can get a little pricey ($16 for eyebrow wax) but the refer a friend deal is great for $5 off. I also get rewards points for every time I come in to get a service so that helps to lower the cost. Location is always clean and I've had a positive experience every time I've come. I can't say it doesn't hurt but the more frequent you wax, the less it hurts. Would totally recommend and will keep coming back!

I've rarely gone anywhere to get alterations done so for my super expensive bridesmaids dress, I was really looking for quality. I saw all the raving reviews for Jenny at Perfect Bride Alterations & Couture and had to call. From the get go, Jenny was very sweet and made the alterations process a breeze. It did take about 4 weeks to get my dress complete BUT, I had a massive hem job and a few other things done with the dress. Just an FYI, the shop has a separate entrance from her home so go to the side with the white door to ring door bell. I really enjoyed my experience, even though the cost of alterations was almost as much as I paid for the original dress. Now it fits perfectly and cannot wait to wear it for the wedding! Would highly recommend!!

I've come here twice and have enjoyed my experiences. I was able to score some adorable lanterns for home décor, bought my sister a vintage chalkboard for her upcoming wedding and some coasters for my dining table. I did have to return a wall plate I bought for a light switch, just because it didn't fit, but other than that, very much enjoy my purchases!  The store is filled now with Christmas decorations! There's tons of stuff everywhere and have items to fill pretty much any room in the house. It's easy to get carried away here but totally worth a look! Check it out, I'm sure you will either get some great craft ideas or end up buying something!

We came in towards closing one night and were greeted with friendly smiles and conversation from Mike (the owner). We told him it was our first time in and he was more than happy to go through the menu with us and proceeded to tell us his restaurant is known for their cheesesteaks. The rumble in my stomach and the smells of meat cooking got me to order one immediately with peppers, onions, mushrooms and cheese. We were told it would be about a 10 minute wait and were given complimentary fountain drinks in the meantime. We were also told the restaurant is getting painted and having some minor renovations to look less like an ice cream shop (ie: checkered floors, ice cream pictures posted, etc.). Place is cute with toys and candies for kids and a Coke machine with glass bottles.   When our food arrived, the cheesesteaks were huge and overflowing with meats and toppings! The bread is heavenly mixed with the tender meat, veggies and melting cheese, WOW! I was super hungry and could barely finish the cheesesteak! This is definitely the right place to go if you are hungry and in need of good food!  Oh, and I did get some ice cream to go (chocolate brownie) and that was also good. I could have done without the walnuts though.  Will be back and lucky for me it's so close to home!

Out of all the places I've ever attended a conference, this one is top notch! Facility is nice and clean, staff is friendly and the food/beverage supply is endless! The food is really awesome (they feed you every 2 hours) and I always get my fill when I come here. Conference rooms/space are very spacious and nice. My only complaint would be the location...it's not exactly easy to find but is in a nice business complex. Overall, this place rocks!

I've gone to 2 of their Valley locations and both are very clean, professional and easy to make appointments. The hair wash part of the appointment is nice and the products used are top notch. I wish there was a scalp massage but having someone wash your hair for 15 minutes still feels nice. Both appointments I have received lasted about 45 minutes. The blow out itself on my hair looked great leaving the salon but started to become limp shortly afterwards. For $35 and tip, this isn't a great plus. However, when I get curls (hair already washed before the appointment), these last for a couple days and that's $25. For the experience, it's great to get pampered and would be fun to do with girlfriends before a night out. I will be back but not something I can do often.

Great brewery with great food! The handlebar hefe is delicious! I also like that you can bring your dog and play board games here- very fun and casual place to hang out with friends while drinking good beer and eating delicious food. What's better than that?!

This place is SO cute for adults and for kids! They have tons of candy to choose from, many of which are hard to find, toys, books, etc. My shopping buddy picked out a few things for an upcoming grandchild and I was sucked into the candy. Service was a little slow but the lady at the counter told us she doesn't work there often. I didn't mind the wait though because it was fun to shop/look around at all the novelties. If you're looking for a little distraction in Old Town for the kiddos or just have a sweet tooth for candy, you should stop by!

I can't decide if this place is nothing like Paradise Bakery or similar to it. It definitely has it's uniqueness but also reminds me of PB. I walked in and was immediately greeted by staff and given a run through of the menu (I told her it was my first time in). I did the $7.99 lunch combo with a sandwich and soup (you can also choose salad). I liked that you went down the line to order everything (like PB). I ordered the chicken pesto Panini and was able to sample soups before making a decision. I liked the tomato basil with orzo so I went with it. Then I saw the desserts and couldn't say no to some chocolate mousse. I got a drink and went to find a table. In the center of the restaurant, there is a technology center with small TV's mounted. I definitely thought that was cool. The drink station was behind it and I also liked the drink recommendations you could make with the different beverage options. Overall, I liked the food that I got, the chicken pesto sandwich had almonds in it and wasn't really a fan of that. The soup was good just couldn't eat an entire bowl of it. Unlike PB, they give you an entire sandwich and a big bowl of soup (with a chocolate cover strawberry). I left feeling extremely full! Overall, I liked Café Zupas and would return!

I often use Yelp to find great businesses and to review my experiences so when my husband and I wanted a pet door installed, we used JGM Pet Doors, based on their raving Yelp reviews. In OUR experience, we cannot in good faith give them a good review. Their quality, customer service and our overall experience were absolutely terrible. I've been waiting several MONTHS to write this review, as it took MONTHS for our experience to finally end with them. I've told my family and friends to NEVER use this company and they all were absolutely appalled when we shared with them our experience.   We wanted a custom install and were quoted $500 and put down a deposit of $250. For the price, we expected great quality AND great customer service. I personally spoke with the owner, Greg, multiple times as the dog door we discussed and the install were both done poorly. After the first install visit, 2 days later, we found the dog door had fallen off. I called Greg multiple times and left messages to let him know this happened. When he finally returned my calls, he blamed it on our dog hitting it and knocking it off. First of all, we wanted to get the door BEFORE the dog so I told him we don't even have a dog so this wasn't possible. He never apologized about HIS company's crappy design or the fact that the door had been poorly installed. They come out again, a few weeks later and the design is poorly executed YET AGAIN. We were so disappointed with the quality that my husband and I both called Greg multiple times and left messages saying this wasn't the quality we had wanted and we wanted our deposit back. Greg finally returned our calls and said they would be out to get the door and refund our deposit. About a month later, we finally get someone out to get the door and refund our deposit.  Greg, I hope you read this because you and your company need serious improvements. We were never rude or upset with you over the phone when we had to call you so many times, since it was so hard reaching you. Now, since our experience is over with your company, I hope you will learn from this experience, as my husband and I definitely have. You told us another company would never be able to provide what we wanted. Let me assure you that we have found that company and at a LOWER price with GREAT customer service!! I honestly don't know how you and your company have so many amazing reviews because this was probably the worst experience with a company and owner I've ever encountered.

The concept of a car wash/boutique/restaurant was completely unique and unexpected as I arrived for a Yelp event. We dropped off my car, walked inside and were greeted with nice smells, smiling employees and tons of merchandise! We were able to sample a couple brews, wines, food and dessert during our duration, all while getting a free car wash! The food was tasty, I especially liked the brisket tacos and coleslaw. The desserts were also very good...I tried the oreo cupcake and a cookie. Employees were quick to take your empty plates away and refill your drinks almost instantaneously, 5 star service for sure!   As we walked around the market, we noticed kitchy items, wines, car products, beverages galore, clothes, scarves...the list goes ON AND ON! Of course, everything was completely overpriced but that is to be expected in Scottsdale. The cute coasters I wanted were almost $40 for 4...yeah right! We didn't catch the demos and after wandering around the store, we walked out to get the car. The car wasn't there so we walked to the front to ask someone where it was then were told to walk to the back (again) to get the car, where were told it was parked in the front. That was confusing...good thing my car was left in a garage type area next to an incredible Lambo! Keys were left inside my car after the car wash, which made me a little uncomfortable because who knows who could have hopped a wall and drove off with my car.   We ended up getting gas at another store (gas here is at least 20 cents more a gallon than most) and upon further inspection, noticed the car wash wasn't very good. I noticed lots of white spots on my black car and had to wipe down areas that the attendants should have...at least it was a free car wash. I don't live anywhere close to here so it was a nice surprise to come here and enjoy a different experience. I think this place would do really well out in a rural area or be a great stop on a long road trip for good food and merchandise.  Maybe an idea for expansion?  Thank you Tom's Thumb and Yelp for a overall good time.

I've spent money here twice; once on a take out order and once inside. Service is slow but you get your food...eventually. I'm a huge Italian food fan, especially when they have chicken parm on the menu. At Frankie's, I've ordered the chicken parmigiana sandwich and the chicken parmigiana meal. Both were absolutely awful!! The sandwich bread was so toasted it crumbled apart and the chicken inside was pathetic with 3 very thin cut strips with a tiny amount of sauce and cheese. Thank God you get a side of marinara because you need the sauce of it to get this down.  The chicken parm meal was also disappointing- the spaghetti is grossly overcooked and the marinara has no flavor. I will say the chocolate mousse cake was delicious but I doubt it's made in house.   I'm sad because Frankie's is pretty close to my house and I really want to like it. It's just not good. Sorry.

This year was my first time going and had an excellent time! I loved how many breweries there were represented from across Arizona and other states. I don't remember every beer I tried but I do remember leaving quite "happy".  Props to the event planners for thinking of everything, including the cooler fans that felt amazing on a warm day! I will definitely come back next year!

I really enjoy this place...been now a few times and have had good experiences. I recommended coming here with a friend who was visiting from out of town to grab a drink and she was also impressed. The house margarita with a chamboard float is great! We also ate the coconut calamari appetizer....phenomenal! The chips are also a bit unique but are delicious! Saturday night was a bit crazy but would recommend to go for a fun time and good food/drinks!

This weekend was my first time attending the festival and I enjoyed every minute I was there! The layout of the event was great, I especially loved the signs with arrows pointing to main points of attraction. Food vendors were aplenty and delicious! I invited many of my friends to attend, even a few from out of state. Everyone had a great time, especially during Hoobastank. Free parking and $10 admission is very reasonable and great for kids (who get in free). The event was pretty packed so I know lots of people enjoyed the festival as well. Plus, the time of year couldn't be better with such perfect weather. Hats off to everyone who puts this event together...job well done! I will be back for as long as this event is around!

I came here for lunch...service line is in the back so you have to walk around the dining area or cut people off in line to "start". I had to re-direct a couple people who came in after me. Service was also really slow and the meat slicer was spitting out meat across the counter. Then, while one of the staff was making my sandwich, there was a disgusting guy who literally came in, cut me off in line, proceeded to the cash register and demanded change for the bus (mind you he didn't order food but would "think about it"). Staff didn't say anything since he wasn't ordering a sandwich...rude much?! I get to the cash register and she asked if I wanted to leave a tip...for what?! Crappy service, rude patrons and mediocre food? No thanks! Needless to say, I won't be back.

I've read the raving reviews about the Maine Lobster Lady food truck in the past but actually happened to find it this past weekend at the Scottsdale Art Festival! I was so excited to try "authentic Maine lobster rolls", as I have never been to Maine nor had a lobster roll before! We walked up and noticed the price of $18 for a lobster roll, $14 for lobster mac and cheese, fried haddock sandwich for $12 and blueberry lemonade for $3. Service was very friendly and was told to try the lobster roll cold, since that's how they eat it in New England. We also ordered the mac and cheese, I mean how often do you see mac and cheese lobster?! I also ordered the blueberry lemonade and waited a few minutes for the food.  The lobster roll was TINY!! There was no sauce and looked nothing like the lobster rolls I've seen before. I got a few pieces of claw meat with a few pieces of lemon on top in a tiny size hot dog looking roll. My friend ordered the lobster mac and said it was COLD! I even took a bite and was shocked it would be cold. It was also cooked with a penne pasta, which is NOT mac and cheese! The only thing I enjoyed was the blueberry lemonade.   For $43 (food and tip), this was a total disappointment!!!!

My sister and I decided to check this place out after hearing good things. The shop is really well located (next to Jimmy Johns and Five Guys) and can be seen right off Scottsdale Road. We walked in and were greeted with delicious smells, cute decor and a friendly staff member. Upon arrival, we were told all about Sweet Tooth Fairy and even the story of how they came up with the name of their vanilla cupcake. The cupcakes look pretty and delicious, so we decide to get 6. We ordered caramel apple, oreo, strawberry, smores, pb&j and cookie dough. The cookie dough was by far our favorite, tasted like a cookie and a cupcake!! We also enjoyed the rest of the cupcakes, just not as good as the cookie dough. The only one we didn't like was the smores...the cake just tasted off.   There were a lot of other goodies here that we didn't try but would love to come back!! Their cakes look amazing as well as their cookies, brownies, cake pops and loaves. I believe they also have a milkshake.  Overall, I liked it and would return if I was in the area and had a sweet tooth!

Since I can't give half stars, I'm giving my review the benefit of the doubt with 5 stars instead of the 4.5 stars I want to give. I went here today with family for my dad's birthday. For a sunday afternoon, it was kinda slow but the ambience inside was pretty cool. We were seated at the large table, which could seat about 15, even though there were only 5 of us. There were a lot of beer choices and I decided to order the raspberry beer, which is amazing! The size of the glass was pretty small for $8 but still a great beer!  We ordered the pretzel appetizer and loved them! The pretzels were huge and the dipping sauces were great! I We also ordered the Belgian fries with sirracha and ranch for dipping. There are other dipping sauce options but those were the ones we chose. In the middle of our table, there were bottles of ketchup, mustard and other arranged sauces. Fries were good, nice they left the skin on them! My mom and sister ordered the field greens salad as well and I was able to taste it. I personally didn't like the dressing (too bitter) but my mom and sister liked it. The greens, veggies and toppings in the salad were good just not the dressing.  For lunch, I ordered the turkey sausage with apple & sage. I chose the apricot and onion chutney as my topping. I loved the chutney and was also able to try my mom's root beer onions, which were good. The sausage was tasty, just not a fan of the pieces of mustard seeds I got throughout the brat. The bread was really delicious, nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside. I didn't feel like it was too big for the brat, which has been a critique I've noticed in other reviews.  For dessert, they brought out the drunken cake. It was a generous portion of cake and it tasted good. We also ordered the soft serve ice cream and the butterscotch root beer float. I was pretty disappointed with the "soft serve" because they didn't have chocolate ice cream and the ice cream wasn't soft serve. The texture was off but still tasted fine. Not worth the $3.50 though! The float was also a big hit as well!  Overall, I would come back and try a different sausage and a different beer. Prices are a tad high but for Scottsdale, that's really not unusual. Everyone in my party enjoyed the food too!

I've been here a couple times and like the vibe overall. I find that Kelly's is spacious, has friendly staff and delicious cocktails! This is a different kind of bar then most in Old Town and find myself drawn here for those reasons. I enjoy the dim lights, wood interior and current holiday decorations. I have not tried the food but hope to soon!

I was introduced to Togo's by my boyfriend, orginially from California. I love sandwiches so of course, I was excited to try a new place. It's about a 10 minute drive from his house (about 20 minutes from mine) so we decide to head over from his place on a sunday afternoon. To my delight, it just happens to be my favorite sandwich as the daily special (turkey and avocado). How awesome!! We decide to order two sandwiches each, one for now and then one for later since the prices are great for the daily special. The sourdough bread is great but a little hard to eat so if you're looking for a softer bread, I'd go with the parmesean. Similar to subway, you are able to add your own toppings but cheese is extra. Sandwiches are stuffed full of goodies and just thinking about it makes me want to eat one now!!  The only negative (for me at least) is that it seems to take a long time for them to make the sandwiches. So, if you're in a hurry, I'd call ahead to order or just plan to be there a little while. My boyfriend and I now dub "Togos" as our sunday afternoon treat spot and have been several times since it opened. Staff is extremely friendly and the place is spotless. Totally love and will keep coming back!!

I love a good sub and Firehouse is a pretty solid choice for me. I always get a hot sub and it's delicious! Food does take a few minutes to get to you so it's not super "fast" food but still can eat in or take to go. Prices are between $5-10 a sub, depending on size, toppings, meats etc.   Good choice, close to home, will be back.

Wow! I've always wanted to try Pearl and I finally got my chance! My boyfriend and I went in on a Saturday night around 8PM and it wasn't super busy. Our waitress was very attentive and received excellent service throughout the night. Food came out quickly and looked delicious. We ordered pot stickers to start ($6) and were good. For the rolls, we ordered a Philly Roll, Vegas Roll, El Diablo Roll and Caterpillar Roll. All of them were delicious! I loved how fresh everything tasted and I loved that the Philly Roll came with avocado inside! My boyfriend could not stop raving about the El Diablo, which came with ceviche on top as well as 2 tacos and a shot of tequila ($1 extra). This one is for the spicy lovers though, which I am not. Most of their specialty rolls are spicy as well.   The prices are higher than other sushi restaurants but definitely worth it for the quality! It won't be somewhere I can go often but definitely somewhere I will know to go again!

I remember this place as Jimmy Woo's (I'm still a little sad it's gone) but Morning Squeeze was a nice stop end stop for the Yelp Shopping Crawl for Local Businesses. We were served a breakfast buffet and received 2 drink coupons, with a choice of a Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. Same layout as before just different color scheme to Jimmy's, there's 2 bars (one outdoors and one indoors, outdoor patio seating and indoor seating). Kitchen is open and booths surround the restaurant with varying tables. Food and everything was OK, drinks were nice, atmosphere was probably my favorite. I would return if I was in the area and looking for a breakfast/brunch hangout spot in Old Town!

I came here for a quick lunch with my boyfriend near our jobs and was definitely impressed! Location is great, right off of Baseline and 24th street inside the same complex as Wal Mart, Taco Bell, Jersey Mike's and Chipotle. The restaurant was clean and staff was very friendly. I ordered the spinach and goat cheese salad and picked at my boyfriend's "smashed" sweet potato fries. Smashed fries include rosemary and other spices...mmm! The sweet potato fries in general are really good! My salad was awesome, I've had their burger and chicken sandwiches before and everything I have had is great! Prices are a little steep (almost $20 for 2 at lunch without drinks) but good food indeed! Will be back!

I decided to take my boyfriend out for a nice Sunday breakfast at a nice little cafe around the corner from his house. We arrived a little after 11AM and had to wait about 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we noticed how cute the decor inside was and how many great choices the menu offers. I decided to get an omellete, red potatoes and biscuits and gravy. We waited about 15 minutes for food but everything that came out was good. Service was spotty but not complaining. I would come back to try some of the other menu items.

Nobody likes having A/C problems, especially during a sweltering Arizona summer, but on an unfortunate occasion, our A/C stopped working. My husband initially called another company to come out and after waiting 4 hours, they called to say the service charge just to come out would be $300. At this point, our home was already 85 degrees. He immediately called Arizona's Duke's of Air after reading all of their 5 star reviews on Yelp for a second opinion. Robert came out 2 hours later and knew the exact issue, fixed it under an hour AND for less than $100! Our exit pipe from the blower to our unit was clogged and gave us helpful tips on how to keep the drain from clogging, maintain our AC and the idea to schedule a yearly maintenance on the entire system. Clearly, this company knows what they are doing and has wonderful customer service!    If you are looking for a great company to fix your A/C, definitely check out Arizona's Dukes of Air! We will definitely be using them again for maintenance and if anything should go wrong.

I was having a bad hair day and wanted to get a blow out. Even though Drybar was a miss for me the first time, I decided to give it another chance (well after their grand opening). I was immediately greeted and asked if I wanted a beverage. My appointment began right on time. Brittany was my stylist and she was EXCELLENT! She clearly knew what she was doing- I appreciated that she told me every product that was going in my hair (permission granted first) and what the product would do. I also got the floater, which was a divine 10 minute scalp massage during my wash. It's $10 extra but so worth it! My appointment lasted an hour as I got my hair curled with a curling iron after it was blown out. She was a good salesperson because I also purchased the gold mine product, which helps with fly away's and serves as a leave in conditioner. She even showed me how the product works in her own hair...pretty cool! I connected well with Brittany and will ask for her again when I come back! Thanks Ali for reaching out to me after my first experience, customer service here is superb! I would recommend for a great experience and great hair!

After driving by this place a bunch of times, I finally stopped in. Place was dead when I arrived and ordering was a little overwhelming for this newbie. The employees were helpful and explained to me the process. There's 10 different sandwiches to choose from and each option has a corresponding brown bag to write down your specifics of the order based on the type of sandwich you pick. There are toppings galore, which is a huge plus for me! It took me a few minutes just to read through the menu and choose my selections. I took my brown bag to the cashier and paid. After a few minutes of waiting, the cookies came out first and were warm. I ate one while I waited for my sandwich and it was pretty good. My total order was a turkey medium sub (10.5 inches), 2 cookies and a large drink for a total of $13. The large drink is good for .50 cents off of a refill if you bring in the cup again. Plus it was kinda cool looking so I bought it. As I was picking up my sandwich, I was told it was made on white bread instead of wheat. I was asked if I wanted them to make it again and but said no because I didn't want to wait again for my sandwich to be made. I've read on other reviews that sandwich orders were incorrect also so this may be somewhat of a problem here, I'm not sure. When I got home and ate my sandwich, I noticed it was a little too salty, not sure why. Overall, I like the concept but would go back and try some things differently :)

I love sushi and have been to several revolving sushi bars around the Valley. I was in the area of Kiku and thought I would stop in for a weekday lunch. I sat by the bar- my server was nice but not attentive. After waiting 15-20 min for sashimi, I ended up asking the owner what happened and she gave me some free miso soup. I appreciate the effort but the soup was terrible. The sushi unfortunately wasn't good quality so everything tasted off. I wanted to like it but the salmon sashimi literally was 3 different colors. All of the revolving sushi I ate was warm and that surprised me because I got there maybe 30 min after opening. For a $30 lunch plus tip, this was really disappointing.   Overall, if you really like sushi, I would skip this place.

I think Over Easy is a very nice breakfast place. Yes, it is more expensive then Ihop and Denny's but the food is really good and has some unique options. I have had in my visits the Dolly breakfast sandwich (egg, tomato, bacon on a English muffin), brioche French toast (plain and Banana's Foster) and the chocolate chip pancakes. Service is also good and overall, it's a nice breakfast place.

I lived in Riverview Park Apartments for just over 2 years with a good friend of mine. When we first moved in to the community, we loved the landlords, space, location and overall apartment. It was a quiet community and we loved how close it was to a lot of attractions. However, after those landlords left (which was about a year later), I truly felt the complex went for a nosedive. I noticed the tenants coming in were trouble. I firmly believe our neighbors were drug dealers and on one Saturday night, someone tried to steal stuff off our patio! The cops were called and I informed management but they really did nothing to alleviate my concerns. I didn't feel safe living there and tried to be home as minimal as possible. Maintenance was also a problem, there's only 1 guy for the entire complex. I had to make many reminder phone calls to management for repairs needed and it took weeks for stuff to get done. Management at that point was very unpredictable and kept trying to increase the price of our rent. At that point, we had enough and decided it was time to go. After we moved out, we hassled with (again) new management to get out deposit back in full. We eventually did but was a frustrating process overall.

Unlike it's neighboring store, this place actually has cute vintage stuff and AC! I liked the fact that "I Love Lucy" was playing on old TV's and set up just like a living room from 1950. There were also 2 adorable bathrooms with kitchy stuff inside to buy. I also liked the snack table, which included free popcorn, candy and cookies. How clever! I didn't end up buying anything here but really liked it. Just be careful walking around...very tight spaces and stuff everywhere! I would probably return.

We decided to come here on a Thursday evening for dinner and we waited about 20 minutes. Décor inside is nice, similar to country log cabin. They do play a lot of country music too, which isn't my personal style but wasn't distracting. Our server was fine but nothing special. Some bread came out after ordering, which was perfect as we were pretty hungry. We did the 2 for $29.99, which was a choice of appetizer or dessert (we chose dessert) and 2 entrees. Entrée selection is limited on this deal but we both went for the Portobello garlic sirloin. Steaks were cooked perfectly and steaks tasted great. Baked potato was also good. We were REALLY full after dinner but still had a dessert to choose from. They were able to actually make the dessert a half size, as the full size could literally feed 3-4 people, and didn't even eat all of the half size dessert. The dessert was really good, very chocolatey. I definitely would come back here again, as this is a cheaper option to other steakhouses and can still get quality food.

This place has changed names so many times but this was the most "updated" name of the venue I could find. It's current name is Ak-Chin Pavilion. Anyways, I came here for the first time to see Gavin DeGraw/The Script/Train last night. I read all the horrible reviews and was a little nervous coming here. We came about an hour before the concert and had no problem with finding the place, parking, getting in or finding a place on the lawn to sit. In my opinion, drinking a beer and being on the lawn was a really wonderful way to enjoy a summer night. The sound and stage set ups for all the bands were really great and thought they put on a great show! The only downside for me was the fact that everything was extremely overpriced. I paid $12 for a beer and water was a whopping $7.50! I would suggest bringing your own water and eating beforehand. The marijuana smoking on the lawn was also a small issue so if you are sensitive to that, beware. Overall, had a great time and would definitely return!

If you're looking for a breakfast/lunch place that is cheap but with delicious food and a lot of variety, this place is it! It does get pretty busy on Sunday mornings but it's worth the wait. Service is good- food is good- price is good. What more could you want?!

I saw a Groupon for this place and decided to buy it, since Ahi is pretty close to my home and was interested in trying something other than Teharu. The deal was $14 for $28 worth of food and drinks (non-alcoholic). My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a weeknight and waited about 15 minutes to be seated. I was OK with waiting because after reading the reviews, it's better to wait because sushi is put out more frequently and in turn is fresh(er). Décor is funky, but in a cool contemporary way. The light fixtures above the entrance kind of reminded me of the Cosmopolitan in Vegas.   Once seated, we were able to start picking sushi off the conveyer belt and begin eating. We also decided to order several fresh rolls, including the Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll, Philly Roll and Spicy Scallop hand roll. Overall service was OK and rolls took about 15 minutes to get. In the meantime, we ate the spring rolls, Alaska roll, dessert and my surprising favorite, the strawberry roll! I have never seen fruit in a sushi roll but this roll was SO tasty, and only $2!! Later, I also saw a banana tempura roll but was too full to try it. Overall, this place has good tasting sushi and really good prices. We walked out of there paying an additional $15 with tip after a $14 groupon. We ate more than $40 worth of sushi so we saved a good amount with the Groupon.  Yum!!

I'll keep this short and sweet- I came with a friend for HH one night and liked the vibe, food and service. The sushi rolls here are above average and I liked the variety. The surf and turf roll was really delicious and I would recommend it. The prices here were pretty high so be prepared.

I'm absolutely obsessed with Snooze and cannot wait for their Gilbert location to open! The décor reminds me of retro modern and the servers here are fun with great personalities! My party decided to order and share so I was able to try multiple things on the menu. Their flight of pancakes is a great deal- we got the pear, pineapple and blueberry streusel. All of them are great but the pear was my favorite! The brioche French toast is outstanding as well. The benedicts are great too because you can order both the same or 2 different ones. I went with the ham and chilaquiles and I loved the chilaquiles one! Hash browns are also great!   I really don't have a negative thing to say about this place. As a tip, they do get very busy so call ahead or be OK with a wait.  Can't wait to eat here again!

On a rare rainy day, I entered the restaurant craving some soup and a sandwich. I could have gone through the drive thru but since this was my first time, I wanted to go inside and get the full experience. At the entrance, cute home décor items were displayed for sale. A fire was roaring in the middle of the restaurant and felt very cozy inside. Before ordering, the pastry display is right there with all these beautiful desserts staring at you screaming "eat me!". Oh I will, don't you worry!  There wasn't a line when I came in but then again it was around 3:30pm on a rainy day. Samples of their bread were available on the counter, in which I grabbed a slice of the asiago cheese bread. So good! I then asked the cashier for recommendations and he said the turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich was the best seller. I ordered it as a whole sandwich, a cup of corn chowder and a couple desserts (a mint chocolate brownie and a chocolate mousse dessert). All this and a beverage for $15, not pricey at all. If we are comparing it to paradise bakery, as many of the other reviews do, this is WAY cheaper!   I wait a few minutes for my food to-go and continued to look around at the items for sale. I waited maybe 5 minutes and everything was ready to go. The sandwich was HUGE and looked so yummy. I couldn't wait to get home and eat. When I got home, I zapped the soup for 30 seconds just to heat it up again. The corn chowder was very good, it had sweet corn which gave it a sweet yet savory flavor. The sandwich was amazing...the focaccia bread was so soft and amazing! The sandwich contents kept falling out but still a great sandwich and was very filling. I actually had to wait many hours before trying the desserts.   The mint chocolate brownie was incredible! I also got the chocolate mousse dessert, which was good but not as good as the brownie. They have lots of other desserts to choose from as well and am excited to come back and try more!  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Kneader's. I am so excited this is not too far away from me and cheaper than other bakeries. I can't say this place really compares to Paradise Bakery anyways, the food and variety of desserts and concept are very different. Would totally recommend and will be back!!

If this is authentic Italian pizza, put me on a jet to Italy PRONTO! Location is great, parking is metered or you pay to park in a lot. $1.20 in change got me roughly 46 minutes on the meter. Seated at the inside bar (there are 2 bars, 1 inside and 1 outside). Décor is nice and outdoor space is perfect for lovely weather. Service was quick and pleasant, even with a personal run through of the menu. My Margherita pizza came out in under 5 minutes and was bigger than the plate it was served on. I was told since the dough is thin it's not all that scary to eat but decided to eat half and save room for dessert. Before dessert came out, the chef brought out a mini dessert of fried dough and powered sugar. Simple yet waited for my cake. Sooo glad I did, the nutella torta was AMAZING! I didn't get a lot of nutella flavor but the hazelnuts and chocolate were divine!  Will come back for sure!

I came in on a weekday basically just to alleviate my curiosity and to maybe get some ideas for furniture to fill up my brand new home. I walked into the showroom and was immediately "hunted down". The guy who helped me was very nice but was obviously trying to get a sale. I told him multiple times I was just looking but he proceeded to follow me around and collect my information. I did see some very nice things but way out of my budget! I was hoping prices were a little more reasonable, as this store is new to Arizona, but we're talking thousands of dollars for a couple sofas. The salesman told me these stores are super well known in Texas and throughout the South and apparently "the best there is". I walked through the dining table area and did like a couple tables. When I asked if anything came in black, the salesman ran around trying to "get some answers" but found out that nothing comes in black. I am surprised that a furniture store of this "quality" has no dining tables in black! When I asked about the financing options, I also wasn't impressed by what I heard. Many competitors are offering no interest for 60 months...they don't. For the "quality", I just can't fathom spending this much money on something that isn't super high end or more well known.

I'm sure this place is a happening spot during sports games but if you're looking for a weeknight dinner, I wouldn't come here. In the 30 minutes we were there, not one server came to our table to greet us or take our drink order let alone our meal order. I actually asked the hostess to have a server come over and after waiting an additional 15 minutes, we decided to leave. Never in my life have I had an experience like this- I was absolutely livid! What kind of a restaurant, which wasn't busy at all the night I went in, wouldn't have someone come over at all in 30 minutes?!   I really was excited to try Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers but now, I will never come back or recommend anyone go there.

My goodness this place is good! I've been several times and have enjoyed my cupcakes each time. My sister and her husband ordered their wedding cake from here and enjoyed their overall cake design and taste. Not a ton of flavors for cupcakes but they are better known for their cakes. My favorite is the cookies and cream cupcake. Plus their sandwich board on cooper is great, check out if you like cupcakes!

I'm always looking for a new spot to try and this place is about a mile from my house. We came in during happy hour and the place was pretty dead. Our server was nice and very attentive, but can tell he was bored with his lack of tables because he came over every 5 minutes. Food choices are American (burgers, salads, sandwiches). We ordered beers, which were $5 for craft beer pints. Beer choices here are good. For HH prices though, I wasn't too impressed. Appetizers are still between $5-10.  For dinner, I ordered the Wrangler burger and fries. I was told to stay far away from the coleslaw, as recommended by our server. My boyfriend ordered the philly cheesesteak and fries. Food arrived and mine tasted fine. My boyfriend said his philly was very dry and the bread was clearly burnt. He couldn't wait to leave. I can't say my burger was bad because it wasn't. I liked the egg bun too. Fries were not warm though and that was a bummer.  We didn't get dessert, just the check. We left for about $30. Sorry TapHouse but we won't be back. Nothing special here

My fiancé and I recently were on the hunt for fantastic living room furniture. Quite honestly, the 1980's sectional we were using just had to go! We came to Living Spaces and went BANANAS for the Barnes reclining living room set, which is all black bonded leather, reclining everything and LED lights! The price was right and the service on the floor was great. But remember, the sales associates do not work on commission (they make sure to tell you this several times).   Now here's why they get 1 star, the delivery. This was a nightmare. Our delivery date was scheduled for a Sunday and got a call Friday that our expected delivery time would be from 12-6pm and a 3 hour time window would be confirmed in a phone call the next day. Never got a call the next day. So, on Sunday, we called to find out more details of the time frame. We were told by customer service we were the last delivery scheduled and would receive a call 30 minutes prior to the driver arriving. The time frame was 2-5PM. At 12:45PM, I received a call from the driver they were 10 minutes away. I was annoyed because we weren't home at the time (ran a quick errand) but told the delivery guy we would rush home to be there. 2 hours go by and we get another call saying they were coming in 20 minutes. I asked why 2 hours went by and they said I told them to come at 5PM. No no, that is not what I said, I said our expected delivery was from 2-5PM as stated by customer service. I don't think the delivery man understood me as he spoke very limited English. I also received a call from customer service saying the delivery truck did come to our house but left because we weren't home. We seriously were gone maybe 15 minutes because the delivery was over an hour early! Anyways, they wanted to drop a $99 fee on us. HECK NO!! I told them to make sure the delivery guy came back because of the mis-information we received. The delivery guy calls again and says they would be there in ANOTHER 20 minutes. Yeah, he told me that 30 minutes ago. The delivery truck arrived at 3:15PM. Guys hardly speak English and set up our furniture. After they left, we noticed the LED lights don't turn on in the sofa. All the recliners worked and that's all they checked.  After ALL the headache of delivery, we now have a technician coming out to fix our brand new couch. I would absolutely never buy again from Living Spaces just because of the delivery and the fact they delivered us a faulty piece of furniture. Customer service and service in store are good but everything else needs serious work. Stay away!!!!

I came here on a Friday night with some friends to enjoy the nice weather and have a couple brews. Parking is close by in a dirt lot with just a quick walk over to the front. Friendly staff and one of the owners greeted us right away as we went upstairs. A nice crowd of people were there, enjoying their drinks with friends. The bar upstairs was slammed so drinks took about 10 minutes to get. I started with a San Tan Hefe, which was cold and delicious. I was with a big group and were able to sit on the nice couches and then moved to an area with smaller tables to nibble on appetizers. The food choices are different but did enjoy what we ordered. Our group had the chips and salsa, which came with 3 different dips. We also ordered the cheese platter and the hummus. The hummus does have a kick, which I wasn't expecting, so I stuck with just eating the veggies. Cheese platter was delicious, especially with a nice cold beer. Chips and dip were good too.   Servers were around to take orders, which made getting drinks and food easy. They do have angry orchard, which I ordered next. The view, weather and vibe of the Perch was really awesome and my favorite part. It is so relaxing to drink, hang out and just enjoy other people's company. I talked with many new people that night, including the owners. James came over to personally thank us for coming and asked if he could get us anything. Personally, I think that is awesome and makes me want to come back even more. Oh, and the women's bathroom is decorated really cute, nice touch!  Yes, this place is new and does still have kinks to work out. It's truly a unique spot and I really had a great time. I can't wait to come back and enjoy, whether it's with a group of friends or on a date with my boyfriend.  Great job James, keep up the good work!!

I got a pedicure here on a weekday. From start to finish, it was 45 minutes. Salon is beautiful and the technician who gave me the pedicure was great. If you're in the area, check this place out for nails.

My boyfriend raved and raved about Winco and talked about his experiences going here often growing up in California. When they finally built out here, we ventured out to shop. Store front is large, in a good location with ample parking. Shopping carts are deeper than normal, which is smart. Store layout is somewhat of a maze in the beginning but is large inside with a lot of product. Prices are noticably lower on many items but not on everything.  It might take me a couple more trips to know what to get here to save money and what I can continue to buy at my neighborhood store. Staff is also very helpful and we used our spend $50 get $10 off coupon. Shoppers bag their own groceries so dont expect that when you shop here. Overall, I liked Winco and will return!

I think it can be challenging to find good seafood in the desert but High Tide is amazing! It's located on the southwest corner of Val Vista and Williams Field Rd in a shopping complex. Hubby and I came on a Tuesday evening, so it wasn't crowded. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant and the smell of seafood as you walk in. Service was great- I also enjoyed reading their weekly specials board. We started with the calamari, which was probably the best I've ever had! The dipping sauces are great, perfectly breaded and not chewy. I ordered the Tide Roast steam pot and my husband ordered the gumbo. Both of us raved about our food and loved how much seafood we got in each dish! I probably counted 15 shrimp in mine along with the crab and crawfish meats. It also came with rolls, which were perfect to dip in our entrees! I also liked on the menu that there were other options for those who don't like or eat seafood. Honestly, I will always eat the seafood when I come back!  Overall, High Tide was great and we cannot wait to return!

I have been waiting YEARS for Cheddar's to make it's way to Arizona. I honestly didn't think it would ever happen but now that it's here, I'm in HEAVEN!!   This location is prime, just on the other side of the 101 to Chandler Mall. Restaurant is extremely clean and looks amazing. You would think from the inside this is a fancy restaurant until you read the prices and think "YES, good food that's actually affordable!" Since this is a new restaurant, expect to wait unless of course you come at like 9:30PM on a weeknight. Service was friendly and efficient, even though it was busy when we came. We ordered an appetizer of chips and queso (adding meat is FREE). Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Caesar  pasta salad, which has been my go-to dish at Cheddar's ever since I've known about it. I think my favorite part of the meal is the unbelievably soft and buttery croissant that comes with the meal. I could eat an entire tray of those things. In fact, during this visit, I had 3 and they only charged me for 2. We didn't get dessert- too full honestly. My boyfriend had a few drinks as well and walked out of there for $40.   Great value, food and service. I will keep coming back!!!

I was misled into this place thinking it was a revolving sushi bar but when I walked inside, it was clearly not. I was seated in a booth and my waitress did not speak very good English. I had to call her over every time I wanted to order or needed a refill on my water. I did come in for lunch and was told about the all you can eat lunch. I felt this was a good deal so I ordered. The flavor of the sushi was just OK- nothing tasted great.   I would not return.

This is definitely NOT a smokehouse or BBQ joint I would ever recommend to anyone. It's a weird concept because they also have fair food too (funnel cakes, corn dogs, etc.) There were 4 in our party that came in on a Saturday night- it was pretty dead inside whereas all the restaurants in the surrounding areas had waits/lines out the door. There's a large smoker and BBQ pit in the middle of the restaurant and there was NOTHING going on in this area! I was scared the food had already been made and we were just going to get stuff warmed up.   Our waitress was completely clueless- whenever we asked her a question she had to bring other servers and even the bartender over to answer anything. We weren't asking anything crazy- just if they could make a Mai Tai. Even though they have a "full bar", 3 of the drinks requested couldn't be made because they didn't carry that specific liquor. My friend finally decides to order a shot of Jack and said the alcohol seemed "watered down".   Food arrives and parts of mine were cold (mac and cheese and the meats were barely warmed). I went with the 2 meat (chicken and pulled pork). During our meal, our waitress takes away the BBQ sauces to "refill them", even though they were more than half way full. I hardly ate my food because everything tasted re-heated and awful!!   Stay far fary away from here!

This was my first time into MOD- went in at the lunch rush. There were about 10 people in front of me in line but the line moved quickly. I really liked how friendly the employees were and how they explained everything. It's awesome you can add whatever toppings you want for the same price. I went with the Dillion James pizza but added chicken, mushrooms and green peppers. The menu is really inclusive with lots of options, even gluten free crust and dairy free cheese. For the pizza and drink, I paid a little over $10. I tried a sample of the blackberry lemonade and it was a little too sweet for me but I saw a lot of people drinking it. From waiting in line to ordering to receiving my pizza, I waited 15 min. Not bad at all! Pizza was a good size with 4 slices and tasted really good! I didn't finish everything but they conveniently have to go boxes by the drink station to take your leftovers home. Tables were being cleaned when I was there so it was very clean.   I would definitely come back!

We live just minutes from downtown Gilbert and were looking for a new place to check out. My fiancé and I came on a Thursday evening around 6PM and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. A lot of large parties were there that night so the waiting area was really crowded and there was very limited seating to wait. We got our text saying a table was ready and were seated in a 4 top with a booth.   Here are the things I really liked: The service was excellent- drinks were always refilled, we were asked several times how food was tasting and ended up staying a couple hours. Bartenders were great and the bar area is nice (and has all the TV's unless you sit outside on the patio). The food was really good- zucchini fries were hot and not overly battered. I got the breakfast burger and it was a party in my mouth! It came with a fried egg, cheese, bacon, lettuce and mayo- mmm good! The ice cream is also really good- we ended with a small vanilla shake. Oh and like other reviews have mentioned, the décor is modern and very nice!   Things I wasn't too impressed with: The prices were steep- my burger was great but $12.50 is about $3 over priced in my opinion. The bathrooms are also outside- yes you have to walk outside just to use the restroom. And, they are tiny so if there's any kind of line, you're probably going to have to wait outside or just hold it. I also didn't like the limited beer menu- they do have some locals and domestics but not very many choices. Many of the beers are also served in cans- which is kind weird for this style of restaurant.   At the end of the day, I will totally come back. But, only if I REALLY want a burger and fries (because that's really all they have other than some salads).

There are so many better breakfast options within a 5 mile radius of this place. For the price, the food is just not good and the restaurant is severely understaffed. A 30-45 minute breakfast visit took almost 2 hours due to the wait to be seated and a long time to get service to order. I will skip this place from now on.

I've been meaning to check out TopGolf since it opened and finally had a chance to go. I went with a group on a Monday night, since weekends can get pretty busy. We got our membership cards and were directed to our bay. Food and drinks were all delicious, we had the fish bowl (says to share with 4 people) and I tried the chicken and waffle sliders. Even though I didn't hit the ball farther than the green section, I still had a blast! It was a very expensive night though so not a place we can go often unfortunately! Definitely check this place out whether you are a pro or a beginner!

We've been coming to this location for years (it's been through quite a few name changes) and it's always been a pretty average bowling alley, no matter how it's "remodeled". We heard about Bowlmor's sunday special deal ($3 shoes and $3.05/game) so we decided to check it out. Décor looks kind of like a nightclub with the dark lights, faux leather couches and black décor. Service, food and drinks were acceptable- when we went to pay, they tried to over charge us for shoes. Our lane also stopped working mid way through the second game. For 5 of us, it ended up costing $60 to bowl 3 games with shoes for 3 people and an additional $40 for food for 2 people and 1 beer.

I've come here a few times for lunch, as this spot is pretty close to my work. If you're looking for someplace quick to get good sushi, this is it! I wouldn't say this is the best sushi I've ever had but it will definitely satisfy that sushi craving. Some of the names of the rolls definitely crack me up...playboy roll? Sexy roll? LOL!  All in all, good place to check out.

I came with my mom on a weeknight and we both enjoyed our experience. The restaurant/bar/lounge/nightclub(?) is an interesting concept but the service and food here were good. We started with the shrimp spring rolls and both ordered pho, I ordered meatball and my mom ordered chicken. The veggies for $2 extra is totally worth it too- they give you a lot of nice broccoli, carrots and other assorted veggies. Good prices here too- I would come back.

My parents introduced my husband and I to this restaurant, which is really a fast casual concept. I ordered the salmon and chicken, which came with 2 sides. I got the zucchini and brown rice for the sides. Everything I ate was very good and it comes on a good size plate. I was hungry again a few hours later though. It's very healthy here so definitely check this place out if you're searching for a healthy and tasty spot!

Hubby and I came here tonight but did the drive thru. This was my first time eating Popeye's. I ordered the chicken po boy combo and my husband got the 4 piece chicken combo. When we got home to eat, I noticed that my chicken was really dry and not very fresh. The coleslaw was OK and my husbands meal was fresher than mine but 2 of his pieces of chicken were tiny!!   If the chicken was fresh, I think this would taste a lot better.

First of all, I'm absolutely stoked there's a good sushi place within walking distance of my home! The complex it's located in doesn't have much for food options so I'm really excited this came up. Yanagi has a wonderful neighborhood feel to it- a place where everyone knows each other and is very welcoming! I came in recently during Happy Hour and was immediately greeted by the owners (Jen and Troy) and sat at the counter. Service is very attentive and great here- drinks are quickly refilled, staff is happy to give suggestions and I received several wonderful samples throughout my visit, as they still consider this time as their "opening". I was so full after I left and got out of there for $24.99 (not including tip). All the classic sushi rolls and dishes are here and they do have some unique items. HH prices are really great too! If you like spicy, try the spicy edamame! I also really enjoyed the salmon avocado sashimi and smoked salmon roll.   If you're looking for a great meal and friendly customer service, look no further! I have no doubt this will be my new favorite hangout spot!
