I like the fact that a retailer stays true. There are many stores out there, "specialty stores", that start to drift from the primary product and start carrying other things in their stores.., not Swarovski.   The Swarovski store at Fashion Square is amazing. I love that the store is so small and the clerks are always so polite and friendly. I walk in, look at stuff, they get stuff, I look more, they get more... Yadda Yadda. They take special care with your purchases and really seem to enjoy what they do. 5 stars for putting up with me!

Well,.... garlicky taters....chipotle chicken thingies..... a Philly steak pita.  Now I'm not what you call a small eater but damn....I had to try a few things for my first experience. My driver had the Portobello  Burger thing and really loved it. I tried a piece....well, I am not a vegetarian but it tasted ok to me! I like mushrooms just as much as any other.  I would say that overall deliciousness is 4 out of 5. Pricing is 3.5 out of 5. I will eat here more often....

The only saving grace for this taco joint is the al pastor tacos and only because it wasn't smothered in their awful tasting pico de gallo. The horchata was old tasting and room temperature-ish... How do you manage that? Its supposed to be an iced beverage, The carne asada taco I tried was barely edible. The meat was over cooked and way too carb√µn "charred". Let me say this... Guacamole is supposed to have avocados in it and chunks!!!!!! WTF? They have the exact same "guac" as Filigatos and every other "Fili or Roli" taco shop out there ..looks like green ranch....creamy and gross!  Isn't this supposed to a cool, eclectic spot to get Americas B*st Tacos? Well, why dont you stop selling the same crappy tacos as the crappy mexican food joints. Make your own guacamole you cheap bums! Americas "commercialized, mediocre" not best tacos... 2 stars because of the Al Pastor taco instead of 1 for false advertising in the business name.. BOO! thumbs down
