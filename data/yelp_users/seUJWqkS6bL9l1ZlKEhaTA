McDonald's food is always the same crap so I'm not reviewing that.  The employees at this location are rude and they have cockroaches.  Other than that is is like every other McDonald's in the US.

I've been to 4 different Original Pancake House locations.  The other 3 are all an absolute treat.  This location sucks.  The food is OK.  The manager is a dishonest dealer.  He charged me for things I did not order and refused to take them off the bill.  The services was unfriendly to say the least.

Super great lady!  I was away from home visiting Arizona and had a periodontal problem -- a big one!  Dr. Tandy got me right in and treated this abscess with a laser.  It felt 100% better the next day.  I got home and my regular periodontist called Dr. Tandy and they talked about my treatment so my regular doc wasn't in the dark.  Really good follow-up.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Tandy and her practice.

The food is the same as every other Chipotle restaurant.  The employees are just rude.
