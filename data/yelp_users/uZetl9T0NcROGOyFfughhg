The line for this drive thru wrapped around the building and took FOREVER to move.  I realized why when I finally got to the window to pick up my grande coffee.  I wasn't even acknowledged to pay for at least 2 minutes and then it took another minute to get my coffee.  I can't imagine how much longer I would have waited for a soy latte.  Normally I would run in and get my coffee but it was an early Saturday morning after a late night.  I wasn't willing to get out of the car.  In any case, next time I'm heading up to the drive thru at Glendale and 16th for a cup at McDonald's.

It seems like I've been giving out a lot of 5 star ratings lately, but my experience at Scottsdale Strands definitely deserved it.   I'm obviously a brunette and called my stylist Kandi and told her I needed a drastic change- something for summer. "Let's go Blonde."  She advised for a few, soft highlights around the face and a fresh cut.   When I smocked up and settled into her chair, I told her my frustrations with my current style - long, heavy, flat by the end of the day - and told her to do her magic.   She highlighted, washed, and cut me and I couldn't be more satisfied! Kandi is very professional and all the ladies in Strands are very friendly. In fact, most of the clients are nice too. I've also had my nails done there in the past and loved it and since my last visit, a new permanent makeup specialist has moved in a semiprivate room and opened a cute, affordable boutique.   Kandi saved me from going blonde - which probably wouldn't have looked so good while letting me leave feeling refreshed for the summer.  If you're looking for a new stylist, I recommend Strands - professional, reasonable, and they actually listen to you!

My boyfriend is in need of a suit in a major way.  His size is uncommon and hard to find and he didn't have time to get a custom suit made.  He's 6'7" and the Men's Wearhouse and other stores didn't offer anything of quality at a reasonable price.  We ventured into Thaku's on Scottsdale Road just South of Camelback on Saturday morning and found a very helpful staff.  The gentleman at Thaku's knew we were coming and had pulled a few suits from their other location so we had more choices.  My boyfriend was fit with a quality suit at a very competitive price.  Some alterations were necessary and Thaku's was able to complete the suit in time for our event.  Any tall, short, or big men can easily find something that fits well at Thaku's.  They have a variety of style to select from - business suits to casual wear.

Every time I go to Z'Tejas I just love it! I always pig out on the Trio App - warm queso, salsa, and guacamole - and taste my meal. I always take home left overs.  Tonight I got the Steak Fajitas. They were delicious and a bit different than other fajitas I've had. There was a citrus flare to these fajitas without too many onions and peppers.   This was the best part:   On Tuesday's Fajitas are only $10.99 and you get 1/2 your first margarita! What a deal. If you've had the margs at Z, you know you don't need much more than 1. 2 will do you. I highly recommend the Chambord Frozen Margarita. Delicious!   The service was quite attentive. Presentation was nice and the patio was perfect.   Quite honestly, not a thing I didn't like at Z'Tejas - Tempe. BTW, I usually frequent the Scottsdale Fashion Square location. They remodeled their entire restaurant. I love the new atmosphere although the patio is always my first choice for a table.

After reading all of the wonderful reviews on Caffe Boa I am sad to say I didn't have a good experience there. First off, let me mention I didn't taste a morsel of food. I was in the area with 4 other friends and we decided to walk in last night at about 7:30 - on a Tuesday. Our friend had called for a reservation for 4 and when we showed up with one extra person, the hostess gave us a look of complete devastation and stress - She would have to push two tables together in a practically empty restaurant. She sat us and we sat, and sat, and sat.   We were never greeted. Not even a water.  We gave the server/manager/whomever a good 10 minutes.  Well, we got up and went to Z'Tejas. I will try again - maybe on a busier night when a newly sat table may not slip through the cracks. I figure our odds of being acknowledged will be greater. :)

As a woman, I'm always on the cautious side when it comes to auto care. I swear it looks like I have a big target on my forehead when I walk into the tire store, the brake store, etc. to get overcharged.   I needed brakes - they were squeaking, not grinding luckily, but I knew I was overdue for new break pads. I opted for Brake Masters for two reasons - good experience in the past with their company and convenience to my office.   Great experience overall. I felt like I was offered services that needed to be done - mostly because they never have done in the life of the vehicle. I was able to get a deal on the price, just by asking and an oil change to boot.  Quick, friendly service with a lifetime guarantee on the life of the break pads.  I would recommend this Brake Masters with confidence.

I went to Lux for a change of studying atmosphere the other evening.  I was lucky enough to find a seat at a table to get down to business.    This is my second visit to Lux and both times I truly enjoyed the pastry I treated myself to and my coffee.  My soy latte was perfect.  The staff is friendly and the crowd is diverse.  I enjoyed the music and atmosphere.  Lux always seems to be a busy spot and I can see why.  While everyone seems to love Lux, I'm not in love with it, but then again, I'm very picky.  ;)

I have had my fair share of burgers and I can confidently say Delux has the best burgers in the valley. I have heard their paninis and salads are great, but if I'm going to Delux, I'm ordering the burger.   I have been to Delux several times and their extensive beer selection, creative drinks, and consistent great service makes their experience just that much more enjoyable.   There are hundreds of reviews, so see them for details regarding the atmosphere and specifics, but I can reassure you their burgers are the best.   Brett is the most attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable server I've had at Delux (July 2010).

Rosie, Dakota, and I LOVE Chaparral Dog Park!!! It's very convenient and surrounded by a lot of paths, a desert xeriscape, baseball fields, ballparks, and a lake with ducks.  The Scottsdale Park and Rec Dept. does a wonderful job of keeping the park clean and shaded.  You can find trash cans and poopy-pick up mitts located all over the park and paths.  The fenced in area is huge to let the dogs run, play, and sniff!

This is a reliable company with honest people.  I have used them for a few plumbing needs.  They helped repair a blockage in my sewage pipes and installed a new water heater.  I recommend this company for trustworthy company.

I just had Jason replace my windshield. He showed up on time and was done really fast. I didn't get any free dinners, but my insurance premiums won't go up! Great job Jason.

I love, love, love Z'Tejas.  Z is conveniently located in Fashion Square.   You can meet up with a friend for happy hour and take care of a few errands all in one evening.  I've had lunch at Z, dinner, drinks, etc and can't remember a negative experience.  Food is consistently fresh and tasty.  Service is always friendly and prompt.  Luckily, the menu offers a wide range of options where not everything is spicy or with a Mexican flare if someone doesn't like the spice.  I like the spice!  Favorite options:   Trio App Skinny Margarita! (rox/salt) Achiote Chicken Chopped Salad Chicken Sandwich Can't Go Wrong! Shrimp and Guac Bites

I like J. Alexander's.  I'm surprised by the disappointing reviews of this place.    I've been here several times and enjoy it, just like I did tonight.  I feel the wine selection is great, my martini was perfect and took the edge off of a long day at work, and the pork tenderloin was very tender and delicious.    I feel the service is always prompt and friendly.  I like the decor and the patio.  Good value for your $$ too.  If you're thinking about giving J. Alexander's a try, I encourage you to.  I think you're going to like it.  :)

True Food is awesome! It inspires me to dissect their recipes and try to cook like this at home.   True food offers a variety of healthy, delicious choices. We started with the Summer Chopped Salad with a nice, light but flavorful vinaigrette dressing. It was a good mix of greens, snap peas, strawberries, walnuts, and goat cheese. It was a good-sized portion for a starter salad.   I opted for the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. I love it and saved the rest for lunch! My handsome dining partner tried the Natural Pan Roaster Chicken with asparagus, fennel, and farro. It was drizzled with a light sauce and was very tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.   So believe it or not, we had room for dessert and tried the Apple-Cranberry Crumble with dairy-free maple flavor ice cream. I should have skipped the salad and had two of these! We also tried the Lemon Cake with Strawberries and Greek Yogurt. That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert.   Other than the awesome food, the service was friendly and attentive. I love the decor as well. True Food Kitchen has an open floor plan (that never seems too loud) and a nice patio.   I would highly recommend! I've dined at True Food several times and have always left satisfied. On other visits, I've tried a variety of their cocktails and enjoyed them. The Teriyaki Brown Rice with Asian Veggies is also great!

My sister, Jessica J (see her review) has been raving about this Gelato place for a while now. She, her boyfriend, and I finally made it in. The owner Ron was there and let me sample as many flavors as I wanted. I really liked all of them! I like the texture and flavor. I usually don't eat Gelato, but I have to say - this was much better than the other Gelato spots in town.   My favorite sweet is anything caramel flavored. The were a little low on the salty caramel Gelato and Ron offered to whip up a fresh batch while we waited. I opted for 1/2 caramel and 1/2 almond rather than waiting. It was delicious and a nice sized serving for the $$. One thing I like too, is that I could get two different flavors in a small cup. At other Gelato places they limit you to one flavor if you order a small. I liked having the option.   Ron basically apprenticed in the Gelato field with one of the most successful Gelato businesses in Europe. He was fortunate to learn from the best and it shows! Give this awesome Gelato a try!

I think I'm in trouble. A Carolina's 5 minutes from my office in Peoria. I didn't realize this was the same Carolina's as the restaurant in Downtown Phoenix until this week, so I introduced the delicious, affordable, Mexican fare to my coworker.   Compared to their original Phoenix location, this location is much more comfortable and clean. Although I appreciate the "taco stand" feel of the Phoenix location, the West restaurant is newer, cleaner, and a bit more welcoming.   I overdid it on the ordering. I over-ordered. I was so excited I couldn't help it! I tried the green corn tamale, a chicken enchilada, and a soft chicken taco. I ate half of everything and was stuffed and saved the rest for dinner. I enjoyed the tamale the most. The size was good too - I'm sure most would say it was a bit on the small size, but I liked that it wasn't huge. My coworker ordered the chips to start and they were awesome. The salsa isn't chunky, but it's spicy and delicious.   What else can I say?! Good cheap, fast, authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for a light, low-cal lunch, this isn't it.   I have to mention the tortillas. I ordered a dozen to take home. I didn't realize they were close to 18" in diameter. I sure hope they freeze well. Carolina's claims they have the best tortillas - and I agree.   The only things I didn't care too much for is the excessive amount of Styrofoam used and the fact that my hair smelled like corn tortillas the rest of the day. :)    Simple, delicious, authentic. Carolina's will not disappoint.

Davis Home Furnishings was a pleasure to work with!  I went in for 2 sofas for my new home and the Designers Chris and Michelle were so helpful selecting the perfect design to fit my style and space.  The sofas arrived right on time and in perfect condition.  I cannot express my happiness with my entire experience with Davis Home Furnishings.  The delivery even went without a hitch.  Next time I'm in the market for more quality furniture, Davis H.F. is my first choice.

I've been wanted to dine at Petite Maison and last night presented me the opportunity to share a nice evening with three dear friends of mine. We went a little later in the evening and were lucky to grab a seat at the bar while we waited for our patio table for four.   I opted with a Malbec (delish!) while a tried two martinis my friends selected. I'm terrible at remembering names (of menu items, not people) but one was a cucumber martini and the other martini had ginger - I preferred the second. Both were great, and the bartender was knowledgeable about the wine and made great martinis. We started with the cheese plate. Four different kinds of cheese and accoutrements- we liked it - how can you go wrong with cheese?  My only gripe is that the cheese serving sizes could have been a bit larger for the $$ but I really liked the thoughtful way the platter was assembled so you could compliment the cheese with a variety of things - candied walnuts, Dijon, salt, pepper, olives....   The bartender suggested his three top favorite meals - the salmon, flank stake, and stuffed chicken. My friends and I split the french onion soup - we HAD to try it and I can say - hands down THE best french onion soup I've ever had. I'm not a big eater so I'm sure I'll be back just for soup - amazing!  Well, we split the three meals between the four of us - The chicken was may favorite - served with delicious potatoes. It was a very rich dish, but the chicken was cooked perfectly. The steak was good (medium-rare - just like I like it) and the fries were awesome.  The salmon was delicious as well, but it was served with a pouched egg that was cooled, breaded and then fried. I was the only girl brave enough to try it and I only took one bite with the salmon. Not a fan of the egg - maybe because I couldn't get over the fact that it was cold. All in all, the meal was satisfying, everything was delicious. This was apparent because 4 chatty friends went silent when the food hit the table.   When the bill came we noticed that our bar tab wasn't transferred. Of course we let them know (maybe we're too nice?!) and because of our honesty we were given creme brule. So glad we did! Again, amazing.   The outside patio is beautiful. I love the quaint ambiance of Petite. I will be returning. You can bet I will get that french onion soup every time I go!

I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  I really liked the food here.  I ordered the Build Your Own Sandwich today with a Groupon coupon.  FRESH, FRESH, FRESH.  Great portion, free chips, clean restaurant, friendly service.  There were 4 women working and I can tell you that if they keep it up, they're going to need some help to get the sandwiches out quickly.  They deliver too - and I'm sure it's with a smile.  I highly recommend for a quick, healthy, homemade lunch.  Prices are reasonable too!  **The restaurant is set off of Main - right across from the Rusty Spur - Look for their "A-Frame" sign on the sidewalk.  You won't miss it.

I went to Indulge Yourself Salon to get a facial by Kimberly.  I had read about Kimberly's work experience and some other reviews online and I was convinced I had to give her a try for a facial.  The facial she gave me was quite thorough and very relaxing.  I was a bit worried that I would break out or my face would be a mess after the extractions, but she was very gentle and thankfully a week later, I don't have any blemishes.  Kimberly was professional and friendly.  The salon is quite comfortable and upscale while quaint.  If you're looking for a relaxing facial, I recommend giving Kimberly a try.  She used all natural products as well.

Dr Wareing is a passionate, personable and knowledgable OB/GYN.  I recently gave birth to our first child and Dr Wareing guided my husband and I through the entire pregnancy and birth with grace and care. I would recommend Dr Wareing to anyone. She is the sole provider in her practice so you are guaranteed to receive top notch care. The support staff at Dr Sally's office is caring and friendly. Dr Sally makes you her priority and makes you feel so special. She really cares about each patient.  The staff at the hospital all rave about Dr Wareing - which I feel goes a long way!!

My girlfriends and I ventured into RnR last night for their first night open.  What a gorgeous building and warm atmosphere.  RnR is going to be the perfect spot for day drinking (due to their abundance of outdoor seating).  My favorite structural aspect of the decor was the wine wall - you can't miss it.  We didn't sample the menu items, just the cocktails.  The cocktails were great - an unusual selection of specialty cocktails. The menu has a a variety of selections without being overly pretentious.   I can't wait to visit again to see how RnR settles in.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great place frequent for lunch and for nights out.

I'm a big fan of independently owned coffee shops, especially one that the owner has a passion for roasting and organic foods.  http://www.echocoffee.com/2010/04/24/now-open/  Echo Coffee opened yesterday in a beautiful small shopping center on the Northwest corner of 68th St. and Thomas Rd.  It's about time Scottsdale has a great place to go for free wi-fi, awesome coffee, and fresh baked pastries.  Granted this place has been open for business less than 24 hours, but I can tell this is going to be a hot spot for Old Town residents.  Phoenix rules the independent coffee shop scene, but Scottsdale can contribute and follow their lead.  I ordered a large coffee and it was made by pouring hot water over fresh ground, organic beans through a paper filter.  I haven't seen this at a coffee shop before.  Delicious taste.   Good luck to Echo.  I can't wait to see how you evolve and I know I'll be there every weekend.

Echo Coffee is rockin'!  I am in love with their coffee and espresso drinks.    I have gone in several times a week since they opened and I see that Echo is getting more popular.  I usually run in for a to-go cup, but last weekend I met a girlfriend there and we visited for 2 hours.  They offer sofas and table with chairs, so it's quite comfortable to sit and talk or get some work done (with their FREE Wi-Fi).  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I haven't tried any pastries yet - not because I haven't wanted to because they look delicious.  I had a small cookie on my latte saucer last weekend and it was delicious.   Echo Coffee is proving to be a great little independent coffee shop.  Their beans are roasted on site and I can tell it's a labor of love for the owner.

Alright! A Fresh and Easy right down the road!   If you haven't visited a F&E yet, you'll find a fresh (obviously) selection of fruits and veggies, popular "regular" groceries, great wines, and ready to eat meals.   To save you money, most of their produce is prepackaged and pretty inexpensive. One of my favorite finds in the produce section is their Broccoli Coleslaw Mix. The suggested serving is to mix with mayo for a slaw, but I suggest eating it with a light sesame soy dressing and F&E Roasted Edamame. Healthy and good!   Fresh and Easy feels like they plucked the best parts of all grocery stores and cut out the B.S. - flowers minus the designer, baked goods minus the bakery, deli cheese and meat sans the counter (check out the price on the brie), and a small drugstore with vitamins, a baby section, and paper needs.  The F&E brand items are marked lower than the national brands and they stand behind their quality, saving you $$.    At checkout - you do your own scanning with your own conveyor belt. Beware - F&E makes shopping fun so you may end up with more in your cart than you needed. In order to celebrate their grand opening, I got a coupon book for $5 off when I spend $20 of more - there are four of them that can be used in weekly time windows.   Check it out!

We had girls night out last Saturday and were so impressed by Lucky Strike.  The vibe was good, the service was good, and the staff was friendly.  We had a reservation for 7 to bowl and checked in and got our clean bowling shoes without a hitch.  Awesome drink specials from 9-close - $2 domestic drafts, $3 well drinks, and $4 house wine.  I was a little put off by the sign out front about the dress code - no "colors", motorcycle wear, construction boots, or cut-offs.  This place was pretty classes and I just hope it stays that way.    Great place to celebrate a birthday or take a group.  Awesome DJ with VIDEOS (I love that) and pool tables.  :)

After having extensions regularly in the past I wanted to get extensions again to lengthen my hair and add to the fullness.  Two of my girlfriends highly recommended AZ Strands - they regularly go there. I'm so glad they recommended them!! AZ Strands did an amazing job!!  Cassandra worked on my hair and not only did it turn out beautifully but she was really nice and fun!  I can tell the hair they used is high quality and they know what they are doing. Since I have worn extensions in the past I knew what to expect. Everything was top notch and I would highly recommend AZ Strands and Cassandra. Thank you, Cassandra!

Always great pizza. Friendly, fast service. This is my favorite thin crust in town. They deliver and have a nice dining area too. They serve beer and wine as well. The wings are always served hot!  Who likes cold wings? Not here!  Give them a try. You'll love it!!

Simply put the food is always delicious. It's consistently flavorful and well-prepared.   The service is great as well. We went for my birthday and a friend's birthday and our server Sarah was very accommodating. She even offered us a birthday dessert.   I ordered the miso salmon prepared medium. Excellent glaze with just enough sweetness and "crust". I substituted the side of asparagus for a special side - cold red beats with goat cheese and a honey sauce - delicious.   Grassroots is easily pulling into my front spot as my "go-to" dinner spot.

When my daughter brought my truck home I asked why the interior was skipped. She told me that she in fact did have the Attendant redo a few spots. He stated, "it was really dirty"!  DUH. I'm not sure how this place got even one star.  If I could rate less than 1 star, I would.
