Always a great place before a sports event of whatever downtown. We had a great server and the best way is to be a member so you get priority seating.   On a DBack game night we waited 10 minutes maybe. The salmon is excellent and the drinks are to die for. They actually use alcohol. The hurricane was delish...I love hard rock

We have lived in the valley for 20 years and have never come up here for dinner. My husband made reservations and we had a very short wait on a Friday night in the summer. Now in the winter not sure about the wait time.  We got there just before sunset and it was amazing. The view is beyond breathtaking and worth the drive alone.   Once at our table the menu was a bit confusing as it looked like a newspaper with nothing inside. They charge for soda water which is a bummer...but plain water is okay.   The salad is served family style with the dressing already on it. I just asked for more plain salad to mix with the other salad. The dressing is very good. I ordered a steak well done and I should have ordered either pork chicken or salmon. I am not a big steak eater. Of course it was a bit dry and chewy. The corn was to die for as were the steamed veggies. The cowboy beans were okay just not my thing. The biscuits were a bit tasteless but the honey butter added flavor but I wasn't wanting to eat that much of it.  They do have dessert but the stock standard is bringing cotton candy to everyone. You can line  dance and enjoy the patio overlooking the city for as long as you want too. Will come again.

I love coming to this place at all times of the season of the year. This place is awesome to relax to have fun and create something new and different.  I have come many times by myself I have also brought my granddaughter here she enjoys painting and has developed the technique and love for painting pottery I think this will be something that we will be doing for a long time.  There is no rush you can stay as long as you like they have lots of color choices and paint choices and tools to help you and the assistance they are also willing to help you draw help you write hope you make your piece your piece and make it perfect

I have eaten here several times and each time I am not disappointed. The food is excellent quality and fast and hot.  The last time I came with my 6 yr old granddaughter who wanted nachos. When they arrived they had everything on them. One look and the manager knew this was not right. He quickly took those away and made the biggest cheesiest place of nachos I have ever seen  This place goes above to make you experience a true pleasure

This is nowhere close to industry standards it is very cheap and tacky. The customer base here is very poor and very diverse.  The store smells old. The cashiers do not necessarily have a good handle on the English language  My recommendation is that you find a different Walmart

I have a very special and rare diamond that deserves the upmost care and concern when dealing with this diamond. Anytime I have come into that Shane Co. I am greeted by a professional staff members that are eager to help me and show me exactly what I may be looking for. They are never in a hurry or pushy in trying to make a sale they truly are trying to help you create your luck that you want for your ring.  I chose a wedding ring set that has diamonds and sapphires it has 21 stones between the two bands and the diamond would make the 22nd stone. Because of the nature of the center diamond I did have to go to Farar jeweler to Rod and have him set the diamond. Once the diamond has been set by Rod Shane Co. honors all warranties and will rhodium and take care of the ring as if it was a normal ring.  Because of the nature of my diamond I don't like to leave it overnight to be rhodium door cleaned every single time I have gone up there the Shane Company has moved heaven and earth to make sure that my ring is done in the afternoon time that I have available the same jeweler takes care of it he knows the ring and takes very good care of it and treat it with the upmost respect that it deserves.  My center diamond is a red 1.24 carat diamond that was created in St. Petersburg Russia with the ashes of my daughter who died six years ago. Shane Co. treats me and my ring and my diamond with the upmost respect that I could possibly ever ask for. I will never ever shop anyplace else when it comes to the careof the ring

I have been going to Dr Bill Halmi for three years and have found him to be honest and open about what treatment works best for my rosecea. As with every disease it is the same with skin conditions every doctor had their own treatment plans and things they will do or not do.  I had VBeam treatment for redness about two years ago and was very pleased with the outcome. Again this is not a treatment that works for everyone but I happen to be lucky enough that it works.  Today August 28, 2014 I went back to have another round of VBeam.  De Halmi has not changes and was the same. The one thing that changed was his prices. For me they had dropped and I was thrilled. I also asked him about another condition and he told me there really isn't anything to be done about it. At least he didn't charge me tons of money for nothing. I for one appreciate his honesty and will continue to go to him.

I have been a loyal customer of Helzberg Diamonds for nearly 20 yrs. I have purchased many items for myself and my three daughters. I have spent many many thousands of dollars in this store specifically.   I have always purchased the warranty agreements. First they were limited by the number of years and then finally they went to the lifetime replacement of EVERYTHING- not just the diamonds. If you still had your 3 yr warranty you were allowed to purchase the lifetime warranty. So I did just that for most all pieces.  I came in today with 9 rings that needed to be resized because of arthritis that has enlarged my knuckle, making it impossible to get my rings on my finger. Then they are too big for the other fingers.   The first sales associate told me that none of my rings purchased before 2009 would be covered. I told her that was not true I had purchased the lifetime warranty and had my magical warranty cards with proof I have been very consistent with my inspections. I told her that she was not around at that time and that my warranties are valid for everything I brought in.   I told her I had brought in nearly $8000 to be taken care of. She went to get the manager of the store. The manager and I have had issues since she took over this location. She has me pegged as a troublesome customer. She is one reason why I no longer purchase items in this store.  She came out and I told her that her troublesome customer was back. She told me "I always come in mad"...I began to tell her that the sales associate was telling me my rings would not be covered when she cut me off and got stern and told me "FINE" she would just do it!!! She took all the warranty cards my rings and went up to the counter.   She told me that they don't have to honor my warranty since I was over on my 6 month inspections. However I have past dates on the warranty card to prove I come in on a regular basis. Nothing was wrong with my rings and NO STONES were missing! I just simply wanted them resized.   I tried to explain to the store manager that she needed to talk to her sales associate and tell her about the past warranties when she cut me off and said "well! I am taking care of this so enough!"  When I left the store I knew that the store manager would be really immature and talk about me. She didn't even wait till I made it out the door before her and the sales associate began talking. This was witnessed my husband who could see them from outside the store.   Make sure you never ever ever ever miss a 6 month inspection or your bought and paid for warranty will be null. And I personally will find a different helzberg diamonds to service my jewelry.

I came to Susannes bridal to look for a prom sees for my daughter. We found many nice things but nothing seemed to be right for that occasion.  I returned in October 2008 to find a ball gown for my daughters cancer victory party. We found the perfect blue ball gown and my daughter felt beautiful for the first time in months of chemo.   The night of the ball in November 2008 she was the belle of the ball and had the best time ever and memories were made. 5 months later my daughter would be laying in her casket in that dress. I never dreamed.  My youngest daughter got married and we came here to find her dress. Susanne the owner remembered me and my other daughter. She treated is like we were her only customers.   I came back in 2012 to her a formal dress for a cruise and I loved it, it was the first time I had been fitted for a formal dress.  Here it is 2014 and I just got finished trying on all different kinds of dresses and found the perfect one. I cannot recommend this bridal shoppe enough. It is the best

This place is a bit divey and had been in our neighborhood for many years. We have walked to eat here several times.   The food is hot and the serving sizes are huge and good. This is the best gyro ever.   The place itself is a bit small and can get very busy. It can be a bit hot during the summer when cooking. The bathrooms are big and clean  I highly recommend eating here for the Greek you may need

I would have giving zero star but that was not an option. This has always been a very fun and good place to come eat for the 22 yrs we have lived in Mesa. It was a fun place for our family to go.   However, tonight, a Saturday night in the hot summer when there were only 2 guests in the whole place they refused to seat our family party of 8. There was plenty of room and no line. We were told because it was Saturday they could not push tables together. This was not acceptable and we left.  Normally I would not think much of it but this is the Saturday before Father's Day. Our family came to spend Father's Day together at this place. Holidays are very difficult for our family as our 21 yr old daughter died 6 yrs ago. Our granddaughter loves the soup here and we thought it would be a fun memory to make.  SHAME ON YOU! SHAME...ON...YOU for having no compassion and accommodating our family. We will never be back again. Your lose

Safeway has been my store to shop at mostly because it is really close to my house. We have survived two remodels and the last one was not the greatest one.  The Starbucks could be bigger and so could the health food section. The produce is not always the freshest. The flowers are good but the roses have a tendency to wilt after a few days not high quality.  Overall the staff is friendly and they know me. My market of choice

Very quaint and great place for sushi! Forget the big chains and bring your appetite here. The quality and quantity is excellent. For dinner we had a delicious salad and soup to begin with.   It may be in a strange location but don't let that fool you. The service and food are excellent. I will come back again and again

I would really consider before burying your loved one here. I recently learned they are holding a Trunk or Treat in the cemetery and they see nothing wrong with this and claim this is an "outreach" to the community. That they service 150 families in the community. With candy? Pumpkins? Really this is a "community outreach?"   When families voices an opinion we were given a stock PC answer as to their decisions. So if they begin with Halloween will Easter egg hunts be next? Where does this stop? This is not a food bank or a church. This is a cemetery.  I have no issue with Memorial Day or fourth if July events being done tastefully to honor veterans... But come Halloween and having fun, that seems a bit tacky and tasteless. Management had refused to listen or call me back concerning this issue. I may move my daughter  After more than 24 hours I received a call from the owner. He was talking in circles and stated he sees nothing wrong with this event. There will be face painting as well. Let's just make it a circus and charge admission. Do yourself a favor and bury your loved one in a non corporate owned cemetery. Corporate ones are just out for money ask could care less about respect or their families

I would consider going to any other cemetery other than this one. The management changed hands and the current management does not care for the community of families that it services.   The cemetery management is truly out for money and money only. They do not care about the families that have loved ones buried out there as proven by the recent trunk or treat event that was scheduled to be held on the property. While the event was changed The whole motivation behind the event leaves me wondering what were they thinking. The cemetery families voiced extreme out rage over this and yet the management having change the name of the event carried out the event regardless because they felt it was "their duty to the community" to hold this event.  I know that they say that they've been in the community since 1951 and it's their duty to return community service however there is a proper respect full way to do things and then there is a tacky in proper way to do things. I know of no other cemetery in the valley that would consider holding a Halloween event on their property open to the public. I do know the Arlington national Cemetery and Pearl Harbor would also not be holding these types of events. When management loses the respect and the sanctity of the cemetery they've lost respect for what they do

Over the last 22 years we have watched this Burger King go thru many changes. When we first moved into our house 21+ years ago this was our first meal in our new neighborhood. Our girls were very young and we had no other places to eat around. We ate here quite a bit over the next few years.   More businesses moved in along with a few more eating places in the area. However the one thing that never changed was this Burger King. Sure there are good days and bad days but overall this place is the best.  They added the computerized drink machine so the sodas have a gray variety and something for everyone every caffeine free diet sodas. The last couple of times we have eaten her the fries have come out so hot I can't eat them.   This is a fast food restaurant and they all make mistakes. Give this place a break and try.

This is my local Target and I love it. Both my daughters worked at this target at one time or another. It is very close to my house and within walking distance if I so desired to do that.  I love all the holiday and then clearance items they have from time to time. I was able to buy a Dyson vacuum for $175 off what everyone else was selling it for.   I shop target for almost everything. But recently learned their prices are not as low as the grocery store on some items   But overall great place to shop for all yor needs

This panda is subpar. It has the ability to be amazing but the skimpy amounts of food they give 90%of the time makes them cheap on food but high on cost.   People are always standing out the door and waiting for food. This staff is never prepared for the dinner rush. And by Rush I mean four people in line. They are always waiting for the veggies and orange chicken.  Tonight on our visit there was a very dangerous sauce spill on the floor in the middle of the walkway. Instead of cleaning it to prevent a fall the workers walked around this for nearly the whole time we were eating. Then one employee went on dinner break right in the middle of the big rush.  This restaurant is always freezing cold and dirty. Only reason why we eat here is it is close to our house. There are much better pandas to eat at.

I placed a call to Falconer Funeral Home while my daughter was in ICU and spoke with Chris. He was very patient and sympathetic as I explained my situation. 10 days later when I had to call for his services he remembered me even though he only heard sobs on the other end of the phone.   From the moment I met with Chris, through the funeral and even afterwards I felt Chris truly cared about me, my daughter and my family. He was very patient as me a very picky and over the top mom made plans for the "perfect" funeral for her 21 yr old daughter.   I highly recommend Falconer Funeral home and Chris Timothy for any and all funeral needs. It is very wonderful to know that in today's world there are people like Chris who really care.

Always a favorite place for me. I love movies and it is great that they have a popcorn shirt and a cup. Makes the price of the movie acceptable when the concessions are free or cheap.   I have been so much that I have a knowledge of what theater is a small one and which ones are big ones. The seats especially in the front bar row could be replaced as they have lost their spring.   For the most part it is the best theater around. Much better than AMC. Harkins popcorn is much better as well

The pharmacy here has always treated me very well and as a personal friend. The pharmacy manager went though my daughters cancer journey with me and was very helpful. The staff doesnt seem to have much turn over.  Overall the store is very well stocked and has a good selection of things that are requires for most drug stores. I like their new reward program for getting RXs filled there's I have saved $30 to days with this program

Had been wanting to go for several weeks. Finally decided to make the trek over to the other side of town to check out the shopping and the restaurants. The wait was not lawn and the atmosphere is beyond great. The Decour is very appropriate very fun and very different.  My husband had a margarita and said it was great my drink was not great asked the waitress to replace it and she replaced it with a different drink that was excellent no problems.  Our food was hot and serve very well ..tasted very good I had the teriyaki chicken with double vegetables my husband had the avocado burger turkey burger with a side salad it was all fresh good hot.  The band was fun and they were just getting started when we left would've liked to of stayed and enjoyed it a little bit longer. But there was no rush for us to get out service was great not an issue. I personally highly recommend this restaurant

Was kept waiting for napkin even though I had been served my edamame. The dish for soy sauce was dirty and now I am waiting to tell my server it is unclean and I need a new one. Not off to a great start.  The food arrived and it was amazing. The amount of yellowtail over the rice was amazing! The biggest portion I have ever seen. The spicy tuna roll was excellent but had a bit too much rice around it. Overall a good dining experience till the check arrived...  Soda water or club soda is not free. Not impressed! Soda water is free everywhere else but not here. That was not appreciated much.  I would come back. It is close and happy hour is okay pricing

This restaurant is a very nice place to go for celebrations something special. With that being said the service is superior to the service at most places.  I began with the spinach salad which was okay but I felt the dressing had no flavor at all. I was excited for the pistachio crusted salmon. I was disappointed that my order was wrong and I did not get the garlic mashed potatoes. I had asked to sub the Brussels sprouts for mixed veggies. The salmon was oven roasted and had no flavor. The maple butter sauce I had in the side was tasteless as well. While the presentation was beautiful the meal itself was average.  The filet steak however was cooked to perfection. It nearly melt in your mouth. The flavor was amazing. This was what I expected from the salmon. The twice baked potato was excellent.  The dessert menu was okay but not terrific on the choices. Seemed average.  Yes I would go back but next time I would not have the salmon.

We have been here on many many occasions and the food is always hot hot and fresh. I have never had a bad meal here. The wait at times can be long but it is worth the wait for Alfredo's green chili pork. It is delicious!! Hot fresh chips and salsa makes it even better.  We had my daughters wedding rehearsal dinner here (yes it is a groom thing...but well) they placed our group in the meeting room and it was wonderful. We had our own servers and a full bar. The manager made me a great deal considering we had to pay. Everyone left full and happy...  This is Mesa's little secret

Love this gym being so close to my house. It is a smaller place but that works for me. Not all the huge muscle men and body builders making you feel insecure about how you look and workout.  They have no pool but who needs one anyway. They do have a jacuzzi and that is all I need

I love BJ's Restaurant and their many variety menu and beer list. They are alway shaking with the newest brew flavored developed in their chandler brewery.  Happy hour is extended till 7 pm most days  I love the cherry chipotle salmon. I have had their salads and pizza as well. Their burgers are beyond amazing. They have shoestring fries that are sooooo good  Finish off the meal with a poozkie-cookie in a skillet with ice cream. They make a donation to charity each time you buy one regardless of the time of year   You cannot go wrong with a great meal for lunch or dinner here

Stay away from this Rubio's if you want to be charged the normal price and not twice as much. Had an argument clearly on my receipt but I had paid for an extra set of black beans the manager at the counter did not give them to me and charge me for them again. I took my receipt back he still could not understand it ended up leaving and getting frustrated over $.89 worth of black beans. What happened to the customer is always right   This is the second time that I've been to this Rubio's and I always wonder if my order is going to be complete as I feel like they don't understand what I am ordering. I eat at a different Rubio's all the time and never have an issue it seems to be this Rubio's in particular. I love Rubio's but stay away from this one

This makes my second time to India Oven and I am hooked!! This is without a doubt the best Food ever. To the soft hot fresh garlic naan that comes table direct from the oven to the desserts it is all delicious.  For a buffet it is sit down high quality food only you can pick and choose what you want.   The service is better than most and they are very attentive and polite. Not a fancy place but not a dive either. It is the best of both worlds combined into a very casual eating environment that makes it a pleasure to come back too over and over again.

This place is the BOMB and I can't get enough of eating here. I eat here at least once a week now. The food and service is top quality all the way. It is best little secret in Mesa!   The buffet has everything you could want and is very very good. The garlic naan is one of the best ones ever. It is soft hot and fresh!  The dessert mango lasso is the best ever.   If you love Indian food or if you have never tried Indian food....this is the best place to go!

I wish they had negative numbers to give as it would be a -10. The crew was a disaster from beginning to end. First off in bringing in the equipment they nearly knocked a fine art painting off the wall in a hallway that was plenty big enough for him to move and bring equipment in.   I also have laminate flooring on all the entrances into the carpeted areas. They cleaned and left the laminate floor completely soaked with water that they didn't clean up and left sitting on pools. Water will ruin laminate flooring so I took nearly half a roll of paper towel to clean up the water from the three entryways. The laminate is about 2 yrs old and the guy using the machine actually cut a gash into the trim piece about the size of a penny.  My carpets were left completely soaked and have taken me 3 days to dry them out with fans and doors and windows open. They simply took no time or care into my carpet cleaning.  When I called to complain I was rescheduled and not given a manager. I my when they called to tell me they were on their way did I get my point across that I needed a manager. The manager that called me back was rude and unsympathetic to what happened. He did refund the scotch guess charge and that was all   I recommend that you get someone else to clean your carpets if you want them done right

I love coming to this IHOP. We have our regular server, Amanda, who is awesome. We eat here for dinner and I get the fir and  fabulous with harvest nut pancakes.   They recently changed this but our favorite server was able to help me out and not charge me an arm and a leg.  The food is good and hot and have never had a long wait or bad food. The drinks are always filled. You will not be disappointed with this IHOP. Ask for Amanda

This Rubio's is the best. The owner and staff are very personable. several of the front cash register people know my order when I come in. It is nice to feel at "home".   I love the fresh made burritos. These are not made beforehand and sitting. You can substitute items and make it healthy with a wheat tortilla. They make their sauces fresh as well.  I highly recommend the mahi grilled fish burrito with the chipotle white sauce. It is delicious hot and fresh

A different type of sandwich as it is heated meat. They do come fully involved with mayo cheese and everything else so not terrific if you are watching what you eat. But you can eat healthy if you remove the fully involvement.   The bread is really good and a pickle spear comes on the side. Their chili is super good too but has enough calories to be a full meal by itself. One unique feature is the computerized drink machine. You can combine so many drink combos that you could come back everyday and not have the same one.

This place is great and has some different items on the menu. The one we went to make us made upset when I forgot to order my sub with cucumbers and they had to get a manager to get them. A bit dumb.  I order the sandwich with the whole grain bread but peel off the crust. It is a bit too much for me.

I love chipotle and am so happy they placed one close to my house. I eat here on the average of 8 meals a weeks between lunch and dinner. It is always fast and friendly.   The staff knows me personally and always makes me feel welcomed. It can be chilly inside bit I bring a jacket or eat outside and it is perfect! No complaints here

A gym is a gym is a gym. We belonged to 24 hour fitness and were bought out by LA Fitness. Not my plan at al. On top of that they promised they would not close out location and within three weeks our gym is now and empty building.   LA fitness is not bad  as it is a very big clean gym. Lots of rooms for racket ball and lots of weight machines. They have very little workout room for hand weights and ball exercises. The pool is nice but is strictly a lap pool only. The locker rooms are nice and the shower area is nice being separate from the changing area  I personally don't happy to like the life fitness equipment they choose to use. While I can make it work I really love PreCor machines better. The personal tvs are okay but feel they are turned down too much and interfere with my personal space

My first visit and I will return. The service was excellent and we were seated right away. Our server was right on the ball and helped me try to make my meal choice since it was  my first time. He had very good suggestions.  I ordered the special mahi mahi with pinenuts, caramelized cauliflower with a spicy sauce. It was excellent but a bit too much sauce for me personally. I would ask for the sauce on the side next time.  Our drinks were filled promptly and the outside seating area was great because it has misters. Our server took the dishes away promptly and brought the check in a fast but polite way.  I will be back again and again and plan to try many new things on their menu. A great new place to eat

I called at the last minute on a Sunday night and I was shocked that Marilee answered. On the spur of the moment move of my daughter I needed movers to load and unload all her things. My husband would be working and I would not be able to lift the heavy items.  Marilee was beyond understanding and helped me get scheduled for the next day. This was absolutely the best decision I have ever made.  The guys, Rob, Soloman and Hugo showed up at my house at the right time and for eight to the job. They wrapped everything in plastic and were beyond careful with everything.  They made it to the location to drop the furniture at the same time. No delay. These guys were amazing and awesome moving the stuff in. They had a huge dresser to carry up an impossible set of stairs. (Lots of Twists and turns) they moved that dresser up like it was bitter. Never touched a thing.   I cannot say enough about this moving company. Everything from beginning phone call to payment was easy and wonderful.

This restaurant is inside the mall. Not much can they so low the stand alone cafes. The down side is they do not have drinks refills anymore. However chick-fil-a next door does. So I get my chicken walnut sandwich and then get my drink next door. Problem solved  Sometimes the portions can be smaller but then you simply ask for a bit more and they usually accommodate you.   Please be aware that this cafe has younger employees and they are not as willing to bend the rules or they do not have the authority to do so.  A chocolate chip cookie comes with each meal and you can substitute for another type of cookie such as peanut butter or oatmeal. I find the oatmeal raisin to be one of the best ones around

Great place and moves very fast even when they have a long line. I love the fact you can make your own pizza and put the toppings on that you want. This is pizza meets fast food at its best.  They have a great outside eating area that had a fire pit in it. Very great place for atmosphere

I highly recommend this most  unique and out if the way place. I have been here twice and have not been disappointed. The outside eating area has been shady and cool so far this warm spring.  I have offered the same thing twice the apple chicken salad sandwich on whole grain bread. It is simply the best one around. I have been craving chicken salad sandwiches and went to chick fila and paradise bakery and ended up here again today. The amount of food is amazing and the chicken salad is excellent.   The staff is very friendly and eager to help and serve your needs

Absolutely the BEST pizza ever! Build your own pizza with any topping baked fresh. Their assortment of toppings is fantastic.  The crust is very good and crunchy and delicious. You can make any other combination you want. They have amazing salads and shakes. The chocolate chip mint shake is solo good.  It is a great place, awesome food and great staff. This would be a hot for a date night or a night with the family
