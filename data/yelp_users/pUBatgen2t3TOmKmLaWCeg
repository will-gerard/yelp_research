The atmosphere was really awesome but everything else was lacking.   Sitting outside under the large trees was really nice, only having Coffee, Tea, Lemonade, and water as your drink choices was not. Oh did I mention you had to serve your own drinks.   The portions were small and expensive, and nothing to write home about in the taste department.  I feel that the only reason people give this 4 stars is because it is trendy to like Organic locally grown places.

This place has become my favorite lunch spot for a grab and go. The burgers are some of the best period. You can not beat the value, a sauteed mushroom and onion 1/3lb burger with fries and a can of soda for 5 bucks! Both times I have been in there the staff was remarkably friendly.   The only real con to this place is that there really is no seating and it is fairly tight. This makes this a pick up and go place.

Two Brothers is the kind of organic, locally grown ingredients place that I tend to find overpriced and highly overrated by people. But this place really delivered. I would say it is one of the best breakfast places I have eaten at.   I ordered the Canadian "peameal" bacon breakfast.  The peameal bacon is more like a slice of ham, the most juicy tasty ham I can remember having. The eggs were full of flavor and the potatoes were a little spicy but excellent.  I think the real surprise was the strawberry jelly which was more like fresh pureed strawberries.  All in all I left full and for less than I expected.

The chicken shawarma pita at Tzikii grill is one of the best I have had. The pita was packed full of savory chicken with just the right amount of added fillings and delicious tzikii sauce.   We also got a side order of hummus which was very tasty and a good thick consistency.   To top it off the staff was exceedingly friendly.  All of this added up to quite an unexpected lunch experience.
