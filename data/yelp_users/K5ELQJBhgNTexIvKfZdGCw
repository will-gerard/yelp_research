I've tried few korean restaurants here in phoenix. but this place probably has more of my flavors than any other. even with their extensive choices of their soon tofu hot pot, it wasn't as good as it is in LA. their rice dishes and summer specials are good, from traditional stone pot bibimbap to cold noodle soups. I also enjoyed their bulgogis... but found that pork one was too sweet for my taste bud. one of my favorites were korean sausage soup with pork innards, oyster, pork and nappa cabbage plate with radish kinchi, and monk fish braised in spicy sauce. I would not recommend fermented soybean paste stew. I found that meat was too gritty.

I have been to pho saigon several times and have taken out few times. their food is always consistent, quick and good. anytime we are in the mood, we always go there.

Didn't your mom ever tell you not to play with your food? well, that rule DOES NOT apply here! so roll up your sleeves, pick off the shells (while sucking every ounce of flavor off from every single piece!) and devour yourself into these heavenly tasting stone crabs!! You will not forget but crave for more and more!  while you're there, I also recommend the oysters rockefeller... It was so good I wanted to lick the remaining off the shell... the best I ever had. and chopped lettuce, tomato onion & bleu cheese... it had real bacon crisped to perfection, flavored oil of some sort (maybe from bacon) was definitely a positive addition! and PLEASE don't forget the key lime pie!! like everything we had for dinner, this too was full of flavors! yum!  not only the was the food excellent, but staff also seemed to have been perfected! highly recommended!

I've only been to see Franco couple of times since he opened in Troon North... vs when he was at Un Bacio, I was there more frequently. I must say that he's food has always been consistent regardless of the location. It's just good Italian food that I'm familiar with.The service staff was always courteous and accommodating. atmosphere comfortable.  If I didn't live so far away, I see myself there more often, especially when my wallet can afford it.

we went to celebrate one of our friend's birthday at this location because 1) it got great reviews 2) we all loved pasta.  the atmosphere was artsy with maybe east coast flair to it. it was narrower, like shot-gun style flat but clean and simply done.  we had some mozzarella and tomato as appetizers. good tomatoes!.. mozzarella had fresh pesto sauce on top which was good, the cheese itself was soft but seemed like it was kosher salt flakes on top of it. it added a nice texture but it made it too salty for my taste buds.  for in betweens, we had some meat balls which was pretty good, something lamb which was very tender like pulled pork, and sauteed calamari without breading which wasn't bad if you like lighter flavored marinara sauce.  for dinner I had this pasta with 12 ingredients from Neapolitan streetwalkers pantry.... yeah, it was the description that got me intrigued. it had some interesting items on there like this olive looking thing with okra liked inside (without the slimes) but flavored like capers. I think that's the most interesting thing about the dish. I picked on my food... which generally mean to me that I didn't care extremely about it ( I could eat a cow and a half it was done right to give you some idea).  what else was interesting about this place is that we had asked for some bread and butter with our meal, you know, Italian place.. gotta have some around? I was surprised to hear that they charge for it.. what?? are you kidding me? I mean the whole meal with 3 apps, 3 sides, 6 entrees, and some cocktails cost as much as really good upscale Italian restaurant in N Scottsdale for party of  7!  over all, if you want some ok food with little twist and  expensive ingredients and pasta shapes that you can't at your local market, and over spend the money you have abundance of, than this is for you! if you want to have the meal that keeps nagging at you at the back of your head, than I say look else where for this is not the place for you.
