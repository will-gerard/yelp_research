I love Cherry Blossom. Love it. That being said it does have some problems. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros:  The Food. The food is absolutely fantastic. Everything is good here. I've had sushi, salads, Italian pasta, udon soup, desserts, all of it. I've never had something that was less than good and most of it is delicious. I've brought many friends and family and they agree the food is good.  The Prices. The prices are very reasonable and despite many visits we are often surprised with how low our bill is considering the quantity and quality of food.  Cons:  The Service. The service isn't exactly bad but it is frequently very slow. The servers are polite but it can be hard to flag them down and difficult to get refills especially during busy times. Also, beware because ordering sushi here is an extremely slow process. I've had friends get full meals from appetizer through dessert before I even get my sushi.  The Bathrooms. The bathrooms are shared with another restaurant and are usually quite filthy. They are also single stall bathrooms which I hate in a restaurant.   I do recommend you eat here though. The food is most definitely worth it. The cons really aren't enough to stop me. Just plan for some extra time.

I adore this gaming store. As a female gamer it can be hard to find a good gaming store that doesn't smell and where all the employees don't stutter and stare at your boobs*coughGamersInncough*.  Game Depot is nothing like that. It is the most super awesome game store ever. It is clean, well lit, smells nice, nice bathroom. Ok, so I'm a little obsessed with the ambiance of my game stores.  There is also an excellent selection of games and minis and books and toys and everything my geeky little roleplaying heart desires. Patty (the owner) is always willing to help me find something new. She has an amazing ability to not only recall the names of most of her customers but also their gaming preferences.  She is also always willing to order something if they don't have it.  I love coming here and I even enjoying playing games in the store. They host a great DnD and I just recommend this place to everyone.

Really everyone? Just 4 stars? Crow's Dairy get's 5. They have the best chevre I've ever tasted. Consistently excellent smooth texture. The flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but it's very smooth and clean. Some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming. I've been buying them at a various local farmer's markets for a while. Since I'm slow on the uptake I didn't realize it was available on the shelves of the Phoenix Public Market every day of the week. Now that I know that I'll be eating it much more frequently. Yum.

The only thing I have pierced are my ears and I'm really not that cool. I love Halo anyway. They have a fantastic jewelry selection not just for those with plugs or exotic piercings. Everyone here is always super friendly and helpful. I've come as the hand holding companion for numerous friends who have gotten pierced. I've always been impressed by the hygiene standards and knowledge of the piercing staff.  I also think their small museum collection of ancient piercings they've had over the years is pretty awesome.

God, I love this place. Every location is awesome. The food is always great. I've never had a single problem other than having to wait because it's packed with so many other people enjoying the awesomeness.   While I do love the pasties, it's great to venture to other areas of the menu as well. Their handmade soups are fantastic and I try to always save room for some. I've had both the Pavlova and the dessert pasty and I could go in for those alone.  They usually have great music playing and the service is always friendly.

I less than 3 Red Hot Robot. I really don't need any of the awesome cool kitschy things they sell but I want them anyway. Want them like crack.  Do I need I stuffed mustache I named General Robert E Lee? No. But they have him and I love. I also don't need the billions of tiny stuffed ninjas but they make my life somehow more complete. And safer. Nothing is safer than having an army of stuffed ninjas at your back.  Every time I come in the store is well laid out and as well stocked as possible considering most of what they sell is limited edition and awesome.  It's also super conveniently located next to Smeeks Candy Shop and the light rail.

I've been going to Tea Infusions since literally the day before the opened. They happened to have the door open and my boyfriend and I wandered in because we were all excited. Unfortunately, we had to come back the next day:)  I love tea and I love their selection. Genmaicha, Blueberry White, Monks Blend, and Moroccan Mint Green Tea are my favorites. I'm really impressed with their Moroccan Mint as it tasted like the tea I actually had in Morocco. I can't say that for the versions most other stores and brands sell. They also get all kinds of interesting seasonal flavors in.  Chrissy(owner), Steve, Tina and the rest of the staff have always been very friendly with me. Always willing to honor my weird requests like layering my whip cream into my blueberry pomegranate tea smoothie.  I love all the little teapots and things they have for sale. Which reminds me I need to go in and get one of their cups with the infusers for work as I've already stashed up on all of their loose tea tins.  It's great too see they are now partnering with Lulu's cupcakes another yummy local independent. Now I can get my tea and cake:)

So my Dad has been wanting to go to this restaurant for forever it seems. He lives on the East Coast and saw it in some restaurant review article.   This week he came to visit so we decided to make reservations. The restaurant had a typical Biltmore atmosphere, nice but snooty. The chairs were very comfortable and the decor was nice. However, there did seem to be a lot of white noise which kind of made it difficult to hear my 4 dinner companions. The bathrooms were very clean and had a really neat sink/rock sculpture/fountain thing going on.  But that's not why you're reading this review. You're reading for the most important question, "How was the food?".  The appetizers, salads and sides were great. We tried the buttered lobster salad, the parsnip soup, the curried duck fries, potatoes au gratin, and the asparagus. They were all quite yummy.  Desserts were also yummy. We had the vanilla flan, the tower of chocolate mousse, and the profiteroles au chocolat. Nom, nom, nom. Is all I have to say.  The entrees however, were very disappointing. The duck two ways was bland and both ways tasted exactly the same. The rack of lamb had almost no flavor as if it had not been seasoned at all. I've quite frequently made better racks of lamb myself at home. The truffle oil filet mignon was also merely adequate. The portions were extremely small   Honestly, for the price Christopher's just really isn't worth it. While the appetizers and desserts are yummy I've can easily have similar items as delicious at much cheaper restaurants. The entrees are definitely not worth it. Small, bland, uninteresting, and overpriced.

Dianne really is Frickin' Awesome!  We met her today at the Yelp event at Kiwanis park. She did face painting on myself, my boyfriend, and two of my female friends. Everyone was fantastic. She can and will paint literally anything you ask for butterflies, gnomes, dinosaurs, motorcycles, whatever.  She is also a total sweetie and was pleasant to deal with. I will be hiring her for my 30th Birthday party.

How can you not like Cornish Pasty's? This place is amazing. Every location is amazing. All the food is amazing.  AMAZING  More seriously, I do go to their locations all the time. The one I end up at the most is the Dobson/Guadalupe location. I love the decor. Church pews are great seats. The place is always packed with a pretty friendly crowd. The jukebox has some really excellent music. The food of course is nomalicious. I highly recommend all their hand crafted soups. I've never had a pasty I didn't like. Of course, also save room for some dessert. The caramel pasty and the pavlova are both killer. The pavlova was so good I went home and learned how to make them so I could have them even when I didn't feel like putting on pants. Sadly, sometimes the desire to not put on pants even outweighs the desire to eat at a place this amazing.

I have really large calves and was so excited to find a pair of boots that fit. Except they didn't quite fit. One I could barely get zipped up and the other one just wasn't going. The guy who runs this place was fantastic. He recommended a liquid that I used to stretch out the boot that was just too tight and he stretched out the other boot for me. Since he only did one boot he only charged half the price! When I got it back it fit perfectly.  Now I have an awesome sexy pair of knee high boots that I'm wearing all the time.  The service was friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. He was also really cool about me not having cash when I showed up. I know the Yelp guide says credit cards are accepted but that is wrong. So don't forget to bring cash. The prices are very reasonable.

I honestly just love this restaurant. Mainly because the food is just so good. The Pan Fried Dumplings are honestly the best I've ever had. My family loves getting the green beans as a side dish. While I know Hong Kong rolls are listed as an appetizer they are a great dessert. I do find the soup broths a little bland.   I admit I have not liked everything I've ever had here but I was exploring dishes. I am an adventurous eater though so I don't blame the kitchen in those cases.  You need to be aware that you're only coming for the food. It's a small hole in the wall location. There is no fancy decor. Most of the wait staff does not speak English. I find a lot of times the behavior some people find rude stem from a difference in culture. You're not going to get a waiter who is super perky and grovels for you if you're the slightest bit displeased. You will instead get basic service that gets your delicious food to you as quickly as possible.   The noodles are amazing. So amazing. No matter what dish you get. Nothing can beat a fresh noodle. I know some people not used to fresh noodles can sometimes find them a bit oddly textured. It's ok. Don't try to compare them to your dried noodles at home. These are different and wonderful.  Everything is super cheap. The food is hot, quick, and delicious. The noodles are amazing and fun to watch being made. What more do you want?

I came here the other night with my brother. We were up late on a week night and happy to find some place that wasn't fast food or Denny's. Seriously, what is up with the lack of delicious late night eats in the East Valley?  Anyway, we had a great time and the food was very good. We were seated right away and the staff was very friendly. They walked us through the whole process because we had never done hot pot before. They made sure we always had plenty of water and came by to top off our broth a few times.  The water was especially important because we got the Yin/Yang broth and the spicy one was ridiculously spicy. Very flavorful but crazy spicy.  The mild broth however was too mild. We found that mixing the two made a great broth. We tried some enki mushrooms, bok choy, the regular beef and they had a special of scallops. Unfortunately, they were the small scallops so they kind of got lost in the broth. If they had been the larger kind it would have worked out better.   We had a lot of fun making our soups and just generally playing with our food. We left completely stuffed and with leftovers for later in the evening. We were kind of conservative because it was our first time but, I think next time we will go a little more wild in our selections.  The tea at the end was delicious.  I understand why people complain about making the food yourselves. If you're one of those people you probably won't like a fondue restaurant either. It's about the experience and if you have fun interacting with your food you will enjoy this kind of restaurant.   I also think this is more of a small group restaurant 2-4 people tops. Stick with two if you have picky eaters or dietary restrictions. I say this because all the tables seem to only have one burner per table. Perhaps they could use a split pot for broth other than the Yin Yang? I don't know. Just something to think about.

I hate to right less pleasant reviews but I'm really not sure what the good reviews are about. These cupcakes were meh. Exactly how yelp describes 2 stars.  The shop itself was adorable and the service was friendly. Unfortunately, that does make up for the cupcakes. Which is sad because they were very pretty looking.  They weren't bad they were just blah. We had the following cupcakes:  vanilla with vanilla buttercream vanilla with milk chocolate buttercream red velvet cotton candy malted milk ball dark chocolate milk chocolate buttercream  The malted milk ball was probably the best of all of them. I did kind of like the milk chocolate buttercream frosting. However, for all of them the cake was kind of dry and bland. Most of the frostings were too sweet. The red velvet was kind of awful. I've been baking red velvet for years and this one was just too much dye with a weird tasting frosting.  I wanted to like it and like I said the shop and staff were super friendly. I just can get the same thing from a cake mix. I know the lady I purchased from emphasized that they were from scratch. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean awesome.

Bookmaze is a fun little used bookstore. They have a wide variety of everything. I've been especially amused by their cookbook section. They also have I believe all the romance novels in the entire world. :)  I also enjoy the little cafe. They make a yummy Italian soda and I love that they have the all sugar coke.  The only downside really is that like the store name it's a maze. While that's kind of cute and fun it can make it difficult to find what your looking for. On the other side half the fun of a used bookstore is never knowing what you're going to find.  Also, they have board game nights every other Monday at 6pm. I've been to a couple and they are super fun. They have some games and encourage people to bring their own.

This man can do amazing things with his hands if you know what I mean ;-) He was a fantastic entertainer and balloon maker at the Yelp Pleydate event at the Phoenix Children's museum last night.   We laughed our rear ends off he was so amusing and he made some fantastic pieces. He's able to come up with great ideas for both children and adult themed items, He made everything anyone requested last night. He even fulfilled our request for the dirtiest balloon creature of the night. He did not disappoint!  Hire this man.

I see Jessica here and she just does an absolutely amazing job on my hair. She's very responsive to requests and meticulous in her work. I've been seeing her for over a year now and I get constant compliments from friends and strangers on my hair. Definitely A+.  The salon itself, just a heads up, doesn't seem to staff a receptionist? So all scheduling etc is done by the individual stylists. So just be aware when you come in and you don't immediately have someone there to greet you/man the phones etc.

I love seeing Jessica. She does an amazing job on my hair. I'm always getting compliments from strangers. Plus, she is just a super sweet person.  Jessica also listens to what you have to say and is willing to work out what you want done. She is very meticulous and cares about her work.  I would absolutely recommend her to anyone.
