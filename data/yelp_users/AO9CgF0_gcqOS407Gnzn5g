Don't know the deal with this restaurant, service not great, took forever.   I asked for my wings extra extra extra well done and nothing.   The table next to us also didn't have good service.   Now I'm in the restroom because of raw wings...not good.   Not going back and I don't recommend, seriously need new Manager and training back to basics.   First time and the last. Ill just drive my but to BWs in Casa Grand lol

Not a bad place, love that it's open early.  I had the Posole and it was ok. Had good meat to hummunie ratio. It needed a little kick with lemon and salt and maybe more spices. I will eat again for sure.  The CSR forgot to give us tostadas.  They weren't included in the order.   Service was quick and love the huge beer options. Not memorable, but a good place to come in the mornings.   Service was a 4 out of 5. Could be cleaner and brighter inside.

Come on Copa! Wheres the service around here!? They gave me my food fast, but....   Forgot my drink, soy sauce, chicken egg rolls, chopsticks and napkins.    Come on guys whats going on here.   The stars speaks for themselves.   It's the essentials in a drive threw that make a difference.   ××Never got my egg rolls××  ××After further eating, now i know why it was fast... wasnt cooked all the way ××

I've wanted to do a review on this place and finally.   DON'T COME HERE, WHY?   Dirty Un Professional Car wash doesn't work well(Ripoff).  Dark Smelly NOT KID FRIENDLY  **ALL THE STAFF IS RUDE**  I would rather go to the QT down the road,  cleaner friendlier and brighter.    The need to clean their act at this Circle K.  **ALL THE STAFF IS RUDE **
