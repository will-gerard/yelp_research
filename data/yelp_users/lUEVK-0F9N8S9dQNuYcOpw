Horrible service.  Took us 45 mins to get a beer on the outside patio, same as our food.  45 minutes for fried pickles and Gumbo!  The checks were messed up at the end as well.  Granted it was a Monday night football, but staff accordingly.  We were celebrating a birthday as well and no offer for free a free drink, shot nothing. Last time I would intentionally go here.

Small office but the doctor was awesome and very polite and make sure you know exactly what he was doing. I also make sure I was very comfortable the entire time. The receptionist and dental hygienist they're also very polite and helpful. I would definitely recommend this dentist office

I bought a Groupon for this to check them out. I split the hour between a 1/2 hour foot reflexology and massage.  The staff was polite and my appointment started on time.  They started with the foot "reflexology" which was basically a foot rub with lotion.  Nothing special or reflex about it.  I was offered no water or any other form of refreshment.  After the foot rub i was told to flip over with my shirt and tie still on and a towel was draped over me and the so called massage began.  It was more painful than relaxing.  Apparently the foot massage employees are not licensed.  I've had better massages from my girlfriend.
