Bomb wings but slow service. Took forever for the food to come out. Cheap drink specials.

Pretty cool place! Stingers has expanded much!! The food had definitely improved a lot. If you have a large party call in advance and they can definitely accommodate you!! Stingers has something for everyone!

Came here to watch RPDR and loved it!! Before I went to a few other bars to watch the show and the majority of people were rude and the bartender some days was cool and others kinda meh. However, a friend of mine said Kolbalt was the place to go and boy was she right!! After coming to Kolbalt I knew this was the spot to enjoy RPDR!! Atmosphere was  better and LOVE the bartenders!! Oh and they gave out free Dominos pizza and also let you bring in outside food! In case you are wondering what RPDR stands for it is RuPaul's Drag Race! I recommend to come here on a Monday night when the season starts up!! #teamviolet

Very professional and kind staff. My dad is in a wheelchair and was extremely nervous when transferring  out of his wheelchair into the one they had and onto the the MRI table. The staff was so kind and encouraging to him and even helped with my family transfer my dad out of his chair. Great staff!! Also the waiting room was very nice and had cold water. It was a little chilly but other than that it was fine.
