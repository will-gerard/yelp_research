I worked with Cole in creating a GF dessert spread for an event held last weekend. The entire process - from the initial order, through editing to delivery was smooth and professional. Not only did he deliver personally, but he brought along the Chef. Desserts exceeded our expectations, and we will absolutely be using and recommending their catering services in the future.

I cannot say enough fantastic things about Tony's. He is THE BEST in Scottsdale/Phoenix, and you'd be foolish to take your leather anywhere else. The service is ALWAYS fast and his prices are beyond reasonable. This man can seriously fix anything and will sometimes do it within two minutes of you walking in. I have told countless friends/family members about his shop and insist they give him a go. His skill and customer service are outstanding, and I will forever be a repeat customer.

Booked a bus with Jonathan to and from a private event--the entire process from booking to check-in post event was smooth sailing. Jonathan was professional and flexible as our guest count fluctuated. Would highly recommend this company, and will use them again in the future.

After having a 10+ year run with my colorist, I was forced to go elsewhere and was hesitant to say the least. I book an appointment with Ben based on positive yelp reviews and left with a gorgeous color, just quite a bit lighter than anticipated...he welcomed me back to fine tune my color and I've just left the salon, beyond thrilled with the results. Incredibly impressed with his talent, professionalism and business practices, and his assistant, David, gave me an incredible blowout. I am now a client for life.

I worked with RJ in planning and executing an event held this past weekend. He was prompt, professional, and extremely knowledgable. Beyond that, I felt confident he had my and the client's best interest in mind. There was no pushing of unnecessary add-ons onto us - he gave his honest opinion and therefore instilled trust in me as a future client. Though he was unable to attend the actual set-up, I received check-in calls throughout the day, and was assured that if anything needed tweaking, they would edit accordingly, no matter what it took. As an event planner, I've found that degree of flexibility to be rare. I will use his services for every event from here, forward.

As someone who loves Vietnamese food and was thrilled to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, I have to share disappointment for Pho King. I ordered the shrimp bahn mi burrito via grubhub, and I'm truly hoping the wrong item was delivered. Firstly, the burrito did not have any shimp in it and comprised only of dry rice, large pieces of vegetables and jalape√±os with a warm Mayo sauce and warm cucumbers. The flavor was not at all of a bahn mi..any pickled vegetables were masked by immense amounts of American rice, there was no cilantro, no semblance of bahn mi flavor. Disappointed by the order inaccuracy, but moreso over this restaurant underestimating their customers' knowledge of Vietnamese cuisine.

Don't let the strip mall location fool you. Fresh, delicious fish at fair prices. Sashimi was beautifully done and presentation was on point. What really made the experience was the service. We brought in a brood of rowdy children, and the restaurant staff was not only patient and warm but made the experience fun for our family. Highly recommend. We will be back.
