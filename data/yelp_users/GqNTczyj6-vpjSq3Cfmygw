Okay I like this place but prices have gotten higher... And the man that works here always looks at everyone like they are going to steal or something! It not like I wanna pocket a 2 dollar nail art! Customer service sucks

chips, cold cheese, and red salsa? I would have never thought! it is good.  My usual order is the burrito pastor. Its pretty good but I'm usually there for the chips!

I am not a huge steak person but i did enjoy this place. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and ordered the filet mignon. Very tasty! i just felt the prices were a little too expensive for me but i felt it was worth it. Loved the quietness and customer service.

This place is good just not all that great. Hard to find parking and a very long wait for fast food quality items. Just because the restaurant is on a farm doesn't mean it is all organic or high quality. Mormon central thats for sure! so be prepared to be overwhelmed with large families and children running all over the place

Love this place! My recommendation would be to get the wolf pack! Only complaint is the wait... But I guess you can expect that from a place that taste this great! Customer service was fairly neutral .

Amazing! I have no idea what is up with all these negative reviews !!! I've been going here for many years and I can honestly say I've never tried better especially for the prices they offer and quality of the sushi !  Let you be the judge for yoursel. Some people just rate because one bad thing happened and rate so poorly

So i went to this place for my birthday... my expectations were set high and sadly it did not meet. I assumed the meals would be large in portions and the prices to me neutral but was the complete opposite. The food was not that good especially for the prices. I did enjoy the decor though! ALSO the "frozen hot chocolate" was a let down i expected different.

I love this place! i don't know if it was because i was pretty drunk and it was 2 am but i loved the food portions, the drinks, and the customer service. The price for the goblet is pricey! i think $30 but it is large and big enough to share. **Just don't buy water! it seems like the use the glass bottles over and over again and just fill it with regular tap.

I loved this place. The environment, food, customer service was so welcoming and great! The only negative thing I have to say is that by the time my mom and bro got there (amazing) omelet from the "omelet station" and ate it, me n my step dad hadn't even gotten out dish!! A little odd eating your meal after the others have finished... It did take about 45 minutes for eggs. But anyways I still loved it!

Sooo I'm obsessed! Lol I LOVE this place! First time I got the marshmallow with graham crackers? Forgot the name!! Anyways it was a little pricey but once I got my sundae, that thing was huge!! Needless to say I obviously did not finish it. Second time I went I for the strawberry shortcake =bombness!!!!!  Can't go wrong with this place. Excellent customer service just a little packed but line goes quick

Uhhh will never go here again. Just got out of my car and saw that they don't even bother to clean my windows let alone lift my wipers to clean under. Plus my inside is dirty. Will never go back again.

A little pricier then usuall but worth it. They did mine my sisters and my mothers nails and they did a wonderful job, paid very close attention to the detail and to what you want(: I would def. recommend this place! So convenient being that it is right off the 60 fwy

I love this place so much. This is now my new "go to" wing spot! 1st time I went there the lady at the front register offered testers of the wings and different sauces!! She even had the cooks mix different flavors to accommodate the taste I preferred! I also love the drinks they provide if you dine in. Thank you guys so much and please keep the great customer service and wings (: try the lemon pepper

I am definitely fan!!!  the customer service is great and the idea of never ending amazing good quality food is wonderful!! YOU GET ALL THIS ONCE you get through the 2 hour line... Worth it though if you have the patience to wait. ** try going at 1 30 because by the time you get through the semi long line at that time it will be 230 and at that time is it lunch still BUT you get lunch price and 30 min later dinner is served  and dinner line is already formed by the time you are paying!(:
