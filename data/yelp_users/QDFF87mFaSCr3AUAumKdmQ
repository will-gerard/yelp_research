My friends were wanting Thai food and I suggested we go to Wild Thaiger, since it's so good. So we walk in, it's not very busy. Several open tables. The hostess says to wait and runs into the kitchen to talk to a woman putting take out food into bags, she slowly comes back and says "we're understaffed and it will be about 10min before a waiter can get to us". I said that's fine, and asked can we just go sit at the empty table of four then and we'll wait. She looked at me like I said something foreign and refused and said no. I said we can't be seated at the empty table for our party? At this point I'm getting mad and say to her I don't understand why you're refusing to seat us and can wait but you want us to stand in front of the hostess desk. I said never mind, we're leaving, never have been refused to be seated before. She didn't answer, gave me a dirty look and we walked out. I've never experienced anything like that. It's not my fault your understaffed on a weekend, you could have easily seated us with no problem. Absolute horrendous customer service. I've been to your place many times and will not be returning after that.

HANDS DOWN WORST SAFEWAY IN PHX!!!! It is the closest grocer to my home. OMG, Can I ever go there with out the lines going down the aisles!!! Never enough people working, ALWAYS 1-2 CASHIERS each time I have ever gone there. Littered with trash and filth. I would like to not be asked for $$ one time before walking in by the panhandlers of the day. This needs to be addressed, it shoudl not matter that the store is in downtown Phoenix.

Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.  I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey D's in the early 90's we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and say's yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. C'mon man

What an absolute dive, and not in a good way. The day I was so lucky to have gone there was a show of some kind with twinks bouncing all around on the stage with small briefs on, not attractive at all.  Now when entering it be prepared, it reaks of BO, sewer and garbage. I had to push my way through just to get past the entrance, once standing there trying to get my surrounding's, I'm pushed and bumped into as if I am not there. I cannot stand packed places, especially with shirtless, sweaty, smelly guys rubbing into me...yuck. I be-lined it for the patio for escape and stayed there until my friends were ready to leave. Just a awkward mix of very "interesting "people, not the most nice to look at, or trust to leave your drink for any amount of time. It's definitely not worth the olfactory assault to ever go in there again.

So my friend got his phone wet, tried to make a a appt online and not able to do that, had to cal the store and they are fully booked until 5p Sunday. My friend needs the phone traded out ASAP. He has apple care so we walked into the store 2 hours before they closed to hopefully get a lil help. Of course the overly pierced hipster stopped us dead in our tracks. No option to help us. Of course the 10 plus "sales reps" are all wandering around like zombies and can't do a thing. It would take 10 min tops to just switch the phone and pay. You shouldn't have to make a appt, just walk in and get help, I understand there would be a wait but my friend would have a new phone right now instead of having to go back again right when they open tomorrow, and we'll see what happens then. Good grief!!! Zero customer service, rude, very unhelpful service.

I love this place, always inviting, quiet to have a conversation, great atmosphere and good people! I cannot say enough about my barber Alex, he is the man! I have been coming to see him for several months now and will not go anyplace else! He does an immaculate job with his haircut and is a freak of nature with a razor!!!  You can tell he knows what he is doing from how quick and precise he is. He is a great guy to talk you and has alot of great stories from the country from which he immigrated. The price is awesome, only $21, and that includes a perfect cut, styling, razor shave of the neck, sideburns, ears etc, and a cold/ hot  face towel wrap and a great back massage!  If you are a guy who has gone through a myriad of barbers, never finding that one, or did, but was just mediocre then you can stop looking with Alex. If your a guy who is extremely particular about your hair, you will not be disappointed!   **Parking is less than to be desired since it is located right next to Arcadia Tavern, so you might need to valet (complimentary) or park across the street. Saturdays are really busy so if you choose to walk in prepare to wait a few, otherwise I would always call to make an appt first.

I have been coming here since moving back from college in 2002. I love everything about this place; the complimentary beverages, the warm shaving cream neck shave, the attention to each persons haircut, but especially the people who work there. Julie my stylist and salon owner has been cutting my hair 9 years. Does amazing work and is a real sweetheart. Adrian another exceptional stylist does equally amazing. If your looking for a nice to place to look your best, definitely check out Boxers!!

I loved this small business owned liquor store...that was until tonight. I went to purchase a pack of cigarettes. The owner said $6.50, I handed him the card and he said it was declined. I said, that's weird. So I called my card peeps and they said a charge of $7.00 was attempted to be put through??? I went back to the owner and said a charge for $7 was attempted but you told me $6.50. He looked perplexed for a minute then said that was the cash discount. I said I didn't pay with cash, you saw me hand you a card and you said $6.50, never mentioning you will be charging me $7 or that any type of cash discount was not being applied. He said "really, it's only $.50" I said excuse me, .50 is .50, that is still money and not the price you stated or ever advised. He replied "do you want your cigarettes or not, you're holding up customers". So because I called you out on your immoral business practice you get butt hurt and have a fit. Won't be giving my money to this small business again. And if you do go make sure you are getting charged what they say. Many times I've been there buying the same brand of smokes...with cash, and the nice young guy that works there charges $6, the rude older guy always charges $6.50 or $7. It might be only $.50 but it's the principal of the thing, it could be a penny more. YOU NEED TO TELL YOUR CUSTOMERS THE CORRECT PRICE!!!

CHARLIES TACO STAND!!!!!  Charlies is one of the original Gay Bars in Phx. It is a great place to dance and hang with friends, great drink prices and they have a fun after hours.   What I really love about Charlies is the taco stand outside. They are so addicting and will keep you coming back for more. Amazing prices on the food, great flavor on the tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc. They have great horchata too! The people that work the stand are the sweetest people. The guy in the trailer that chops the asada is a real cutie! I just go to Charlies sometimes just for the tacos. They are open really late and if you are out in down or midtown Phoenix I demand you to check them out.

Wow! I'll keep it simple. This small homey Mexican restaurant has the best service I have ever experienced. The best mexican food ever! Everything is made from scratch, the flavors burst in your mouth and everything comes out piping hot! Order the Baja chicken burrito or the patio chimi! The salsa is amazing, ask for the hot stuff....so good!  Order the maragarita or ice cold can of tecate! Oh and every time I have been out waiter brings us a complimentary shot from the bar!  Take your friends and family here, you'll never go anywhere else.

The best hashbrowns I have ever had. Cripsy, buttery, not soggy or soaking in grease. Cooked well done, can't wait to go back. I went for brunch around 10:30-11am and the wait is not as bad as earlier in the morning.

JOHNNY CHU...I LOVE YOU. Sens is hands down my favorite place for asian in dwntwn Phx. The environment, the decor, the food and drink selection are all spot on. They have Hitachino Nest, a wonderful rice beer. It some of the best beer I have ever tasted, especially the Red Rice!!! When you go, you need to get the Green Papaya salad with fried tofu, the Red Clay Curry Pot, and the amazing Mint Lime Beef Carpacio. Your tongue will have an orgasm, I guarantee it!!!! It has a great ambiance and a dj that plays great tracks. The server's are all very educated and informed on the menu and drinks. They have great daily specials, so make sure to ask your server. It is tapas so go with friends and split alot of dishes. Chef Chu exposes the true flavors of Japanese in small dishes. SENS ROCKS!!!

I am profoundly saddened to hear that Sens will be closing 5/6/2012. Sens is the best place to eat in downtown Phoenix, in my opinion. Johnny Chu will be moving to a new location on Central and Thomas, opening in June '12. It will have some of the same familiar items that the Sens menu had but also some new ones to match his new fresh concept. He will be naming it Shochu House. Get down to Sens before it closes to enjoy some of the greatest food ever!! Thank you Sens for so many great years, amazing food, and kick ass Sake!!! I and Downtown Phoenix will miss you. See you at Shochu in June!!

Hanny's is hands down my favorite place to frequent in downtown Phoenix. I was out late after a concert at the Crescent Ballroom and my friend and I needed some nosh! Everything in the area was closed except HANNY'S! The kitchen cooks until 1am every night, the bar pours till 1:30am. The ambiance of Hanny's is great, a old department store from the 40's-50's renovated into is new found glory today. Multi leveled with twisting stairs, a interesting bathroom area and a great elevator shaft that you can walk over!!! The interior is very sleek and refined, but very comfortable. The bar is beautiful, they have great drinks, even a Moscow Mule that comes in a real copper mug! The have great martini prices, only $5. The food selection is great, amazing salads, appetizers, pizza's &  sandwich's. I had the proscutto pizza with arugula. It was delicous. My friend had the beet salad with onion straws app. Also very good. The server we had was very attentive, professional and knew what he was doing. A wonderful experience and a grat place for a date or night out with friends!!!

My friends from work went to Hula for our team's Xmas gathering. It was out first time for everyone and we were very impressed. We went b/c we heard about the great HH special they do on Wednesday's. HH prices on apps and drinks till 11pm. The patio outfront looks great, cant wait to chill out there once it warms up! We sat inthe main dining area. The decor was great, old retro pics cover the walls and great tiki mugs on another. We all order our drinks and numerous app's to try everything. The food was great, very flavorful, good spice and it came out hot. I would suggest the Hawaiian Ceviche, crispy coconut shrimp rolls and the Fish cakes for apps, they were soooo good. For my cocktail I would highly suggest the Tiki Bastard, has Bourbon, Gin, Ginger Beer, lime and maraschino liquid. Not one complaint on any of it. The HH prices on all app's and drinks was a great deal. I can't wait to go back again!!!

Love this place!!! It's right across the street from my house. The XL Asada burrito is awesome, The Carne Asada is juicy and sooo flavorful, hand cut while you wait. I also got  America's corn and some street tacos! I absolutely love the corn, at first the idea of mayo on the corn put me off but it's amazing, especially with the cotina cheese and sauce they put on it. i love that they give you a lil baggie of cucumbers and radishes with your order, it comes in handy to clean your palate after some of the salsa. My friend had a Margarita but I had to try the Horchata.....so good, just the right amount of sweet, cinnamon and it was ice cold!!! Can't wait to go again

Hands down one of the best fast food burgers I have ever had. The Deluxe Butter Burger is incredible. The gristle on the edge of the burger is awesome, all the ingredients are fresh, crisp and you can actually taste everything. I love the options for sides; get the side salad, fresh lettuce, real tomatoes and freshly grated cheddar cheese. I tried the cheese curds but was not impressed. They were very, very salty. That was the only item I disliked. You must have a single scoop custard to top it all off. Absolutely delicious! The restaurant is very clean and modern, the staff is very friendly. I was just a little put off by the food linked Bible versus painted on the walls

I cannot say enough about this pub/ my second home. The pub has a homey/ family atmosphere during the day and into happy hour. At night it turns into a fun rocking hang out, especially on the weekends.   I am a sucker for a good happy hour and this place has possibly the best in Tempe. $2!! Jameson They are only $5 regularly, but 4-7 weekdays are a real steal. Also on happy hour are $3 glasses of wine, well drinks (which are made with surprisingly decent liquors) and $1 off a great draft selection. I suggest Jameson and Ginger during happy hour, or a nice Magners or the Irish mainstay Guinness. ( Which is poured to perfection, make sure Jay, Ross, or Brandon are pouring)   Also on special is the entire appetizer list at half off. You can easily make a meal out of the mussels at $5 or the best chicken strips ever, or sausages, which both include a big basket of tasty fries. My personal favorites the Garlic Shrimp and Irish Potato Cakes are a must have!!!   The regular menu has a lot of variety and you can't go wrong with any of the "pies", cottage, Guinness, chicken or my personal favorite, the seafood. The Robbie Fox or the Southern Chicken sandwich are also amazing. They also switch their menu around to match the season's. The summer menu debut's 6/17!!   Sunday's before 6pm you can also enjoy happy hour pricing on appetizers as well as half priced bottles of wine. The patio is always dog friendly and every first Sunday of the month they now have a Doggy Brunch until 3   Robbie's has a great European cafe society feel to it, and the regulars all know each others names and are family. Check out the framed photo of the lads/ regulars on the west wall when walking in. Robbie Fox, Dominic Jones and Ann-Marie are always there and are never to shy to make sure your visit was great, your service rocked or walk up to say hi or give you a pat on the back!   Robbie owns the patio and has a plethora of music playing during all times of the day and night. You cannot sit at the bar and not have some sort of sing along with the regulars.   All in all RFPH is literally a pub " Where everybody knows your Name"   Remember: We came for a pint but stayed for the Craic!!!!!

BEST BURGER HANDS DOWN!!!!!! Quality ingredients, great prices! The fries are out fo this world, and the onion straws are a great addition. The egg bun they use is so good. You get alot of burger for your buck! Only thing I did not like was that everything had to be bought separately, no combos, but that is minor.

We love the Vig. Been their many times. We ordered take out this evening. Pad Thai. My friend was enjoying his meal and bit into a piece of wire that was in his pad Thai. Luckily he didn't cut or slice his mouth or swallow it but it was shocking this was in his food. I was not happy. Never had that happen before.

Film Bar is awesome!!!!!!!! They show a wide variety of movies ranging from classic films to new independent movies. I've heard from several friends of wonderful documentaries that they have shown there. They also show some cult classics. If you get a punch card, after you see 4 movies the 5th is free! If you go on Monday the films are discounted. They also have a glorious happy hour as well, and don't forget to ask them about their film bar fly program.  It's cozy and comfy (both in the lounge and in the theater), with a nice Moraccan feel. My friend brought me on a Saturday night and it was pumping. On Saturday they host a world music night. The creation of legendary local deejay, DJentrification. You definitely need to check this place out.

All I can say is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE that Phoenix finally has something to be proud of in it's downtown. I don't have to yearn for Portland, OR to experience great music, food and drink at a local venue, one that has great character, and a great location. The list if upcoming shows and bands is impressive. Major props to Charlie Levy for opening this great venue!

A sister restaurant to my homebase Robbie Fox's. I was lucky to attend a soft opening a few weeks back and was unbelievably impressed. The building is gorgeous, the decor and design are superb. I especiallly liked seeing all the different rooms and pictures, especially all the ones of JFK! The old church organ in the main dining room is a wonderful touch! Since it is a new establishment, the new servers will eventually get their legs, same goes for the food being cooked in the back. Chef Mark though has created a wonderfully tasteful menu. It makes me jealous of the food at Robbie's. The owner's Robbie and Dominic have worked very hard on this new pub and it shows. I wish I lived closer to it though, there are no signs of obnoxious ASU students to detract from the environment!!!! I forsee Johnny Fox's becoming the best pub in the west valley; dishing out pints of "Craic" for years to come!

Hands down, the best Mexican street food EVER!! Run by the nicest, sweetest people. Best carne asada tacos I've ever had. Blow's Americas taco shop out of the water. (Sorry America, your food is still good) impeccable service, get there early though. Lines are long and can take a while since only one order taker for the line outside and the drunks inside Charlie's.

Came here with my boyfriend the Saturday before last and have been here 7 times since. By far my favorite new local bar. This vintage gem is everything a bar should be. It's very small, it has a gorgeous penny topped bar. The beer and wine selection is extensive and thorough. It changes every few weeks. It's a family owned bar, father and son. Greg  the head bartender is a pro on his beer and wine knowledge. Always excited to tell you what new selections he has. The expansive green chalkboard if full of choices that would quench anyone's palate. The prices are unbeatable for the high end beer and wine choices he offers. HH until 8pm daily, $3 beers and $5 glasses of wine. Greg's father Steve rocks a fedora nightly, and is always happily chatting up the customers and making you feel welcomed. Greg's sweet wife Chrissy is there pouring wine or making a freshly prepared charcuterie plate, dishing out a delicious brownie or a free Hershey kiss! It's just a wonderfully local, small business that will be getting my money for years to come. Get your asses down to the Whining Pig for a great time filled with good drink and great people!!

First time here. Checked it out after hearing good things. Was not impressed and very disappointed. They were out of French toast, oatmeal and biscuits and gravy. The things I heard such good things about. Why don't we order enough product to cover the demand, especially if it's a popular item. I found it to be very overpriced for what you get. I ordered a BLT and a iced coffee, $14!!. My friend I was with ordered the breakfast sandwich. The way they were prepared made it almost impossible to eat. The breakfast sandwich falls apart in the first bite with how they layered the items and the bread used for the BLT is so hard and the bacon not evenly placed it punctures the bread and mayo goes everywhere. Not happy at all. Would try it again but hope for a better experience.
