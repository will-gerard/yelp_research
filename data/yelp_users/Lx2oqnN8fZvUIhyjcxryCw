Scottsdale Air is the only call you need to make if you are in need of a new a/c system or repairs.  I own a restaurant and have had countless hvac companies preform work over the last two decades.  Most are happy to take advantage of the situation to make a quick buck instead of building a relationship to earn work and referrals.    I was in desperate need of 2 new a/c systems on my home as the previous units had exhausted their repair options and it was almost summer.  i decided to ask the clients of my restaurant for recommendations for companies to do the work.  Scottsdale Air kept coming up and all the reviews were glowing.  Scottsdale Air had positive reviews of residential, commercial and private wine cellar cooling systems.  My clients of the restaurant said to call Mike Cross and your cooling needs will be history.  Since my clients were willing to trust him with their priceless wine collections and luxury homes, I would be a fool not to call him.    I started by doing my due diligence and getting three estimates from Howard Air, Goettl and Scottsdale Air.   After seeing all the companies in action,  Scottsdale Air was my definite choice.   Mike calculated the loads, suggested new plenums and Lennox Signature High Seer Units.  Even though this was more work and higher end units then the other companies suggested the price was the best value in the group.  The professionalism of Scottsdale Air set it apart as well.  The excitement Mike showed for improving the quality of my family's life with a properly running system was evident.  On install day the appointment had been confirmed.   The crew of 4 people showed up clean, on time and treated my family and home with respect.  The cranes coordinated with them effortlessly and i could tell i was in the hands of professionals.  They removed 2 entire attic systems and outdoor units without a trace of dust in my home.  As the day went on and my promised completion time of 5 pm approached,  another crew showed up to help with he final steps to ensure they were finished on time.  i couldn't have been happier with he experience and had never experienced a service company run that well.    I have proudly recommended Scottsdale Air to my family, friends and clients.  I urge you to do the same and Call Mike Cross at Scottsdale Air to take care of you.

The juice bar doesn't serve organic juice the apples and cucumbers that are basically the base and the bulk of the juice is inorganic even though you can see organic cucumbers and apples from the juice bar they refuse to use them unless you buy them separately at over $10 a juice there should at least be a sign that says that my juices in organic I think of enough people complain they could fix it by walking all the way over to the produce section 5 feet from the juice bar and grabbing organic cucumbers and apples for everybody just trying to inform the public since Whole Foods refuses to do so
