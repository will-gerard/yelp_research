Not a very good pizza. Chewy crust and the toppings looked like they have been sitting on my pizza overnight. The pizza literally looked like what my leftovers looked like in college. I didn't realize you could mess up a pizza.

My cousin is a locksmith in San Antonio, TX and gave me the low down on what to look for in hiring a locksmith. I called 5 locksmiths listed on Yelp with high reviews but felt Avid gave the most reasonable quote based on my cousin's advice. Wow, did I choose correctly. Not only was his price the best, he included 4 keys and fixed 2 doors that weren't closing correctly at no charge. After he left, I immediately sent his information to my realtor to give to his clients. Zach is the type of person you hope every technician would be like.

We moved into a new house and had a tight schedule for cleaning our couches and then cleaning our new tile in the new house. Mark had his tech come out in the morning and clean our furniture and then he came out later in the day when we got our keys to the new house and cleaned the tile. I asked about sealing the grout and he gave me a quote but said I could also do it myself for half the price. He then gave me all the information on where to buy the sealant and how to apply. I would totally recommend GCS if you want an honest company with fair prices and great results.
