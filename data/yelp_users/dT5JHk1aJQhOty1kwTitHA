I enjoyed the Arizona Ultimate Women's Expo.  It was something that of course was geared towards women, but I saw several men there as well.  I must have entered at least 15 drawings.  Deidre Hall was great.  It's an even better time if you can get a few girlfriends to go with you.  There were 4 different stations for alcohol samples.  Some of them were good some not so much, like the Senorita Limonita.  That was horrible.  If anyone plans on going in the future, plan ahead.  I totally didn't even think about the Diamondbacks playing.  I had to drive a little bit further for parking, which was worth it.  It only cost me $5, whereas every other lot or garage I saw, was $15 or $20.  Also, take your time when walking through the expo.  There's so much to see and do.  Find out when the keynote speakers go on and when demos are, so that you can get the most out of it.

The service is always great.  Everyone is friendly.  The food is amazing.  I love the spicy tuna roll and california roll.  My husband had the chow mein with beef, which I tasted and I started eating that too.  I couldn't get enough of any of it.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and they offer take-out.  I know a lot of people speak highly of the sushi restaurants in Old Town, but if you just don't want to go all that way, definitely go to Moto.  You'll love it.  And for those Spicy food lovers, Moto offers all levels of spice.  Just be careful what you ask for.  If you know what I mean.  The name of the menu item will say it all.

I just went here for the first time yesterday.  I loved it.  Jonathan was amazing.  He listened to what I wanted and I love my new cut and style.

I have heard great things about this place and I had purchased one of those online deals to try it out.  I was not disappointed.  The only reason, I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was freezing.  But I had a small chocolate milkshake and the special of the day, philly cheesesteak.  My husband had a cheeseburger slider, chili cheese dog, and french fries.  We really liked the food.  If you want the sliders, make sure you order at least 3, I would say, because they're kind of small.  My husband is from Illinois, so walking into Chicago Hamburger Co, was amazing.  There is so much chicago decor, it's ridiculous, but since I've only been to chicago once, I liked reading all the signs and seeing pictures of former Bears players.    We will most defiinitely return.

This place has really good thick and thin crust pizza.  I've never been a fan of thin crust because of it being so crispy and it just wasn't good to me.  However, the thin crust pizza here is quite good.  I would order it again.  It's really small inside the restaurant, so I would recommend ordering it to go.

Every Friday night, there is live music and every single time we've been there, the band has been awesome.  It's a great atmosphere.  You can hang out inside and dance or go outside and sit down with your friends and still hear the music.

I love this location.  Everyone is really nice.  And the speed of the service is amazing.  You may be the 7th car in the drive-thru, but you will place your order, pay, and receive your food in 5 minutes.  Same goes for when you're inside.  There is limited seated inside, but there's usually not a long line and you get helped and served right away.  Right now I live within walking distance, but if I moved further away and there was another McDonald's that was closer to me, I would still go out of my way to go to this one.

My husband came with me to do laundry once.  The laundromat is in the same area and of course while I was doing that, he hung out at The Blooze.  I would go over in between loads.  There was only one person working in the front of house.  She was really nice.  She didn't lose her cool at all when more people started coming in.  She handled it well.  Especially when a regular at the bar was giving her a hard time.  She just went with the flow and eventually he left.  They have 2 pool tables, darts and a stage for a band on the weekends.  If you are already there when the band is setting up, you just get a stamp and don't have to pay cover, which is awesome.  We ended up leaving before the band came on, but we plan on going back soon.  It is a little bit of a dive, but everyone there was friendly.  And they don't serve food, so eat before hand, but the drinks are cheap.

Okay, so I finally decided it was time to get rid of my old flip phone and upgrade to a smartphone.  I was super excited.  My grandmother and Iare on a family plan together and she lives in Tucson.  She mailed me my phone and was told that I can just go to a Sprint Store up here and have it activated.  I took my phone into this store and the associate, I think his name was John, told me in order to access the account, he needed the pin # or the answer to the security question.  I didn't know either and I used the store's phone to call my grandma (since sprint had turned off my service a couple days before) and my grandma was giving me a lot of answers that were not the right ones.  I was really upset and couldn't believe that this was so difficult.  I asked to speak to someone else and he said that they would tell me the same thing.  At this point, I'm the only customer in the store and two other associates are wandering around and I know they can tell I'm upset.  Neither of them came over and offered to help at all....He told me that my grandmother had to call customer service to reset the password.  Well, that's a whole other story.  Well, at the end of the day when I met up with my husband (after he had a few beers) he took my phone played around on it for literally less than a minute and magically, it was activated.    I can't believe that this person is in customer service.  He is an idiot and should be fired.  When I was extremely upset, he showed no emotion at all and couldn't help me at all.  The next day, my husband and I went into this exact same sprint store, to get my contacts transferred over and I just wish that guy had been there.  We did however, let one of the managers know of the situation the day before.  I'm not sure if anything will be done about it.  It's best to avoid this store.

Every time that I have been to this location.  I always leave happy.  Not only do I love their $ menu, but each time, the service is great.  They are always asking me how my day has been and more importantly, they are smiling.  I love that.

So, I am giving this Zipps 5 stars, because have become regulars here and even though we now live 20 minutes away, we still try to make it over here as often as possible.  Joey, the manager, is awesome and always says "Hi".  We know several servers and the bartenders.  Everyone has been super nice and friendly.  The food is always amazing, especially the golden-menium wings, cookie skillet and of course the monaco foccacia.  They have a pool table, 2 dartboards, and 2 golden tee games (my husband is a fan).  During NFL season, they open an hour earlier and serve breakfast.  My husband and I had our first date here and this is also where we had our rehearsal dinner.  It is amazing.

My friends and I enjoy going here on Sundays for football.  Of course, I live the closest and have to be the first one there to get us a good table by the right tv's.  Food is really good, over 100 tv's, and battle for sound (so just because the Cardinals play during your team's game, doesn't mean that they will get the sound.  Bears' sound has won every time).  I'm not crazy about the service.  Sometimes we don't see our server for a really long time and no matter who we have, they almost never smile.  I know this isn't the most glamorous job, but "fake it til you make it".  At least pretend you want to be there.  Other than that, we love the atmosphere, some of the fans get too carried away, but that's okay.  It's pretty funny.    It's nice that they give you a layout of where all the games are going to be, so you know when you walk in, what table to get.  I like to get there at least an hour before the first game, so I have my pick of spots, plus if you land a table that has chairs with backs on them, you're golden.

I had never tried Bikram yoga before and I had heard about this place and for new students, they offer 30 days for $30 of unlimited classes.  I loved it.  My husband and I started going together and he is the opposite of what yoga is, so when I was able to get him to 5 classes, I was amazed.  I also told some friends and they jumped on the bandwagon too.  It is an awesome way to sweat and believe me, you have never sweat like this before.  All the instructors are awesome.  Andrea, the owner, is amazing.  If only I could have her body.  What was great, was when you are in a relaxed state (for about 20 seconds) lying on your stomach, she will come by and step on your feet.  It's like a little foot massage.  Make sure you get to class about 15 minutes early so you can grab a good spot, bring plenty of water and be ready to sweat.

Whenever we need to board our chihuahua/jack russel mix, we always bring him here.  Everyone that I have met here is very nice and accomodating.  They are very experienced and focused on customer service.  They always ask me if I would be interested in extra play times or a bath before I pick him up.  I have never had any issue with them.  And for it being in north Scottsdale and a "resort", it is priced very reasonably.    There is a very large outdoor play area and the runs are in 3 different sizes, I believe.  There is no other boarding place that I will go.

If you are out in Old Town and find yourself needing to go to the bathroom, Bungalow has the best restrooms.  I believe in the Women's restroom, there are 4 stalls and they are very spacious and clean too...Just in case anyone was wondering.

Hated it!!!  I had a pasta dish and had to pay an extra $4 bucks for 2 tiny shrimp.  My husband had a burger, which I swear would have been on the kids menu anywhere else, because it was so tiny.  Our server had absolutely no personality at all.  Would not recommend this place

Okay, so this Starbucks is in no way close to where we live.  I have been here about 3 times before just to meet with our realtor, because it is close to halfway between our homes....  So, we were here on Memorial Day at 5:30pm (it closed at 6) to fill out some papers.  We were just sitting there minding our own business, when this man walked up to the counter and he was there for less than 5 seconds, before he started demanding someone help him.  I noticed that one employee was making a drink and the other was helping another customer.  The man at the counter said "Can I get some service" and he was not nice about it at all.  The employee making the drink told him, that he was busy, so hold on a minute.  The man at the counter said " I'm busy too"....The employee finished the drink and helped the man, but the man was still rude to him and continued to be rude until he walked outside.  When he was outside, he was just sitting at one of the tables with his friends, kicking his feet up....Some hurry he was in.   He was still there when we left.  I don't understand people.  I give the employee 4 stars for still being calm and having to deal with that.  I am a server at a restaurant and there are times when I want to tell someone off, but have to keep my cool.

This experience is based soley on the deli....I had ordered a sandwich platter to include ham, turkey, roastbeef, and veggie.  I even emphasized having a few veggie sandwiches, because at the get together I was having, two of my good friends do not eat meat.  When I went to pick up the platter, just by looking I could tell that there was not one veggie sandwich.  When I mentioned this to the woman at the deli, she said "there should be some veggie, because the lady you ordered from made them herself".  I replied, "should be" and "are" are two different things.  Then she just ignored me. She was rude and I can't believe she didn't have the common courtesy to at least turn around and speak to me face to face. (She was cutting meat with her back turned to me). We tried to fix the problem by looking for some veggie wraps in the cooler right there, but there were none, so we settled for two salads. At my gathering, one of my friends had to leave to get something more substantial.  I do not plan on giving any more of my business to this deli.

Subway is so great.  I try not to eat out too often, but when I don't want to feel guilty about going to Mcdonald's or Chipotle, I usually choose Subway.  This location is within walking distance from my home.  Plus, they always have these deals going on.  For the rest of June, there are three 6" subs that you can get for $2 each.  How great is that?  Those subs are the Cold Cut Trio, Meatball Marinara and the Veggie.  Yummmmm.

This review is about 2 months late, but just knowing that I kept this place in mind means something.  So,  let me start by saying "this place is horrible".  A group of friends and I went here before the Arizona/ASU basketball game.  Now, knowing that the 2 schools are rivals, you would think that it would be a big turn out.  Well,  it was.  Apparently, The Tavern didn't bother staffing for it.  The place was packed.  There were only a handful of servers.  Our server was in no hurry to help us.  Our friend waited over an hour for his food and he only got his food after telling the bartender.  Also, many drinks were dying while they sat at the bar, so we just walked up and grabbed ours.  When we asked for the check, it took her at least 20 minutes to drop it off and it was all wrong.  There was another tables food and drink on it.  We told our server and she "corrected it".  Except, she didn't.  It was still wrong.  So, we did it ourselves and left her the exact amount of what we owed.  I'm a server myself, so I know how things go.  Worst place ever.

I love Circle K.  86 cents for a 32 or 44 oz fountain drink.  If you use your Fry's VIP card at the pump, you save 10 cents.  These 2 reasons are why I love Circle K.  You have to look out for children running through the parking lot, bicyclists, or random rap star wannabe's trying to hand out their cd's.  Super annoying.

I absolutely love big lots.  They have most of anything you are looking for.  All of it for way cheaper than what you would find elsewhere.  You want christmas decorations, body wash, cereal, a couch, picture frames, dvd's?  They have it.  It's never crowded.  The only possible downside could be that they often only have one checkout open, so there might be several people in front of you.  Other than that, this place ROCKS!!!

I got a massage here about a year ago and the massage therapist was horrible.  He rubbed my skin raw and for days it felt like I had a 3rd degree sunburn.  However, I get stressed easily and that causes knots in my shoulders and since Massage Envy is a well-known chain around Phoenix, I figured I'd give them another try.  This time, I had a female named Vanessa.  She was really good and listened to me.  They always customize your massage for you.  Just make sure you communicate with your massage therapist and don't be afraid to say something if the massage doesn't feel right.

This Wendy's is right by Paradise Valley Mall.  It has a completely revamped look, which is awesome.  I would recommend trying the Cheesey Chedderburgers on the dollar menu.  They are so great.  Plus, they're on the dollar menu....Hello?!?!  They are really fast and friendly there.  They also have those cool looking soda machines, if you like that kind of thing, which I do.  You get to choose different flavors of coke you would like.  It's just really cool.

Went here for my birthday.  From the moment we walked in, I wasn't all that impressed.  Sure the decor and ambiance  is nice, but I think this is a place where people go "to be seen".  The tables are so close together that people kept bumping into my husband's chair as they walked by and when I was getting into my seat, my butt was pretty much on the table next to us.  The sushi was nothing to brag about and the rolls kept falling apart.  My husband had finished his beer well before we finished our meal and the server never asked him if he wanted another beverage.  Won't be back.

We went here last night for the first time.  We really enjoyed it.  We sat down at the bar and the bartender greeted us right away.  She was really nice.  The next thing we noticed was that the bar had an icy edge to it.  The part of the bar that's closest to the bartender is covered in ice and that's where your drink stays so it keeps cold.  How cool is that?  Pun intended.    Also, we had awesome timing, because Trivia started at 8pm and we just made it.  We enjoy playing trivia, which Hazelwood's has 3 nights a week.    They also have a pool table, foozeball, shuffelboard, a boxing game, and big buck hunter.  They also have dartboards, but you have to bring your own steeltip darts.    For those Jack Daniels lovers, they have single barrel and it was just $6.50.  There are about 16 beers on tap, including Guinness.    Give this place a try.

I had never heard of Sweet Republic until a week ago.  I knew they were celebrating their birthday by giving away free single scoops of ice cream.  I read several reviews and not one of them had anything bad to say about it.  I am now one of those reviews.  This place is awesome.  I had the brownie swirl.  Love it.  Check this place out.  They also have sorbet.

I have only been to this theater once.  I was hanging out with some girlfriends and this is the closest theater to where they live.  At first glance, it looks like a typical movie theater.  For the most part it is.  The thing that I found awesome, was that it has a daycare center.  If a couple wants to go to a movie and it's not appropriate for the child or they just want to do something for the two of them, they can bring their little one to the day care center.  I can't believe all the parents, who bring their kids to adult movies.  It's unacceptable and of course selfish of the parents.  I hope other theaters catch on to this.    It's also right next to Buffalo Wild Wings and several shops and other restaurants in the area.  Check it out.

The Lodge is a pretty low key place.  It's great to go there to just hang out with friends.  There's a pool table and darts in the back and if you go outside you can play bags (ie. cornhole).  It doesn't normally get too crowded, however, it can feel busy.  Nicole was our server and she was great.  The only thing is, I feel like she was all over the place, especially at the end when we were ready to close out our tabs.  That's the ony time we had a problem.  It seems like The Lodge needs to hire more staff, so their current staff doesn't have to be running from one side of the restaurant to the other.  I was very impressed by Nicole's attentiveness, though.  There were over 30 people in our group (we had reserved the back room) and she managed to keep everyone's bills in order.  I thought that was amazing, usually servers have difficulty doing that with huge groups.  I don't even remember having to tell her what tab to put my drinks on.  She just knew.

This branch is right down the street from where I work.  It comes in handy when my computer at home is acting up.  I have been coming here about every 2 days or so for the past couple weeks.  They have a good amount of computers.  Some are Express, which means their only for 15 minutes and others allow you to stay on for an hour.  There's hardly ever a wait to use a computer.  If you need to print something, it's 25 cents per page, which isn't that bad.  Faxing is free.    There's also several areas where you can sit down and get some work done.    I haven't looked at their book/cd/dvd collections yet, but from what I can tell, there is a wide variety.

My husband and I love this place.  It is so close to where we live, that when we decide last minute that we don't want to cook, we more than likely call Babbo for carryout.  It is best on Mondays and Tuesdays because they have spaghetti and meatball for $5.99.  They are huge portions too.  It also comes with garlic bread, which is really good.  Sometimes we split 1 and are completely satisfied with that.  I also had the Pasta Rustico, which was really good as well.  We've never dined in though, so I can't really say what that experience would be.

I got a coupon for a free panty.  As soon as I walked in, the sales guy was really helpful and showed me where to look.  I overheard him talking to these women who came in after me.  He definitely was knowledgable about the products and very comfortable talking about it.  I thought that was pretty cool.  My only criticism would be that I was at the counter waiting to check-out and he was still helping those ladies and when he finally made it up to the counter, he checked that lady out first.  I'm in customer service and I would have politely told her that I need to take care of this young lady first.  This is especially so, since he continued to talk to her about the product she was buying and he decided to tell her about a brand that was even better, so he went to grab that one.  I mean c'mon.    One tip: if you're buying panties, go 1 or 2 sizes bigger than what you normally buy, because they run small.  As far as the panties go, they seemed to be pretty inexpensive.

I LOVE CULVER'S!!!!  It's from the midwest.  I had not tried Culver's until I met my now husband(he's from Illinois), who introduced me to this awesome place.  Since that first meeting, I was hooked.  Now locations are popping up everywhere.  I love it.    They are best known for their Butter Burgers and their Custard.  Me, personally, I will go there just for the custard.  I recommend a small or medium chocolate custard concrete mixer with brownie pieces.  Yummy!!!  Don't get a large, because that is way too much, you'll get a tummy ache.  If ever I'm feeling down, I will always turn to Culver's.  Their butter burgers are good as well.  Low fat and low in calories....Yeah right.  But they sure are tasty.    My friend is from Wisconsin and will go here just for the cheese curds.    Culver's is a place to go once in awhile as a treat to yourself, because the prices are little on the high side.  Besides you don't want to spoil yourself too much, otherwise you might lose appreciation for it.  Definitely go here.

Two of my good friends live here.  The apartments are awesome.  They live in a 2 bed/2 bath.  Great view of the pool.  There are 3 floors.  2 pools.  We've been to both pools.  It's not heated, so you have to just go for it.  Sundays are usually the busiest day, so get down there early enough to find a good spot and a lounge chair.  There is a fun sprinkler type area for little kids to play in.  There are also 3 spas and I believe 2 huge grilles at this pool.  Make sure when you walk into the clubhouse, that you cover up, or they will yell at you.  I just say "Whatever, I don't live here".  At the smaller pool, it's less crowded.   Still not heated....Jump in.  1 big grille and 1 spa.  There's a little less sun at that pool, but it's still a good choice if you don't want to deal with alot of people.  Of course, you may come across some annoying child that wants to get in on your game of toss and ends up throwing your ball over the fence.  But that's a possibility anywhere you go.   In the clubhouse, there is a gym, a pool table, computers and a private movie theater.  If you want to watch a movie, you sign up for a time slot and invite your friends.  It's pretty cool.   Aspire is close to I-17 and is also gated.  Norterra is within walking distance.  Anything you are looking for, is right there.

Any time I plan to go to the movies, I try to find a time at Picture Show that works for me.  Even though, it's located at PV Mall, it is far less crowded than the bigger theatres.  Also, because it is at the mall, there are plenty of places in the area to grab a quick bite to eat before or after the movie.  Ticket prices are less expensive.  Concession prices are more reasonable (still up there, but more doable).  I especially like all the room that I get in the actual theater.  The seats are comfy and I don't feel cramped.  Since there is less foot traffic, the staff is always friendly and I often strike up a brief conversation with them before going into the theater.  So, next time you want to go to the movies, give this one a go.  You will not regret it.

City Scape has a lot to offer.  There's Stand Up Live, Copper Blues, Lucky Strike Bowling, Chipotle and CVS.  There is also a parking garage located right beneath it.  If you are going to Stand Up Live, bring your parking ticket with you and they will validate it at the door.  That's awesome.

Since we moved to 16th street, my husband and I have been meaning to try Rico's.  Tonight, we finally went for dinner.  We were greeted with a friendly and warm welcome by the hostess.  However, it took awhile for our server to greet us.  When he did, he wasn't very personable at all.  We started off with the honey hot wings.  It felt like forever for these to come out.  The sauce was good, but the wings came out in these 2 little buckets.  That was kind of weird, because it makes grabbing the wings more difficult.  Then I ordered the Margherita Flatbread and my husband ordered the Steakhouse Burger.  He got to choose which cheese he wanted and the server wasn't even sure what cheeses they had so he asked a nearby server.  Our entrees were actually out pretty quickly.  However, my husband's burger had the wrong cheese and apparently the burger comes with chips as its side, not fries, which was a little weird.  I did enjoy the Margherita Flatbread.    The restrooms were really nice and clean.  I liked the atmosphere of the whole restaurant.  We went on a Thursday night and it was pretty dead.  A couple people in the dining area and the rest in the bar section, which is where we sat.  They have a huge patio, which looks ideal for large groups. The menu had very few options.  It was pricey.  We were pretty surprised about the prices.  They do have happy hour though from 3pm-7pm, Monday thru Friday (I believe).  If we do return, it would be most likely during that time or lunch, because as a Yelper, you get a special discount.  A positive note for those who are guests at the Squaw Peak Resort, you can charge the bill to your room.

My husband and I absolutely love this place.  It is just across the street from where we live, so it's very convenient for us.  We love the food.  I definitely recommend trying the Carnitas Burrito chimi style and my husband absolutely loves the Chicken  Burritos az style.  Don't forget the green salsa.  It's amazing.  For the price that your paying, they give you a pretty big portion.  I usually don't get any sides, because the burrito is more than enough to keep me satiated.  They also serve margaritas and cervesas.  It's a nice place to sit down and relax while eating and since it's not in a busy location, there's never a line and always plenty of places to sit.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I wish more people knew about this place.  It's 100x better than Filibertos and more affordable than Chipotle.  Heck, even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place.  Check it out.

Third time's the charm.  We went to see Greg Fitzsimmons for my friend's birthday last Thursday.  Greg Fitzsimmons was super funny, I've never laughed so hard.  This was my first time going on a Thursday, which was nice.  It didn't feel packed, but there were of course a lot of people there to see Greg.  We sat right in front of the stage  These seats weren't that bad, except my husband had to turn in sort of an awkward manner to look at the stage.  I wish they had small round tables instead.  On my end, I was freezing.  The first two times there, I was comfortable, but this time I was so cold.  Our server was really nice and super attentive.

This is the absolute worst bar that I have ever been to.  First off, when we pulled into the tiny parking lot, we saw what we can only assume was a drug deal.  Not a great start.  Then, once inside, we sat at a table and waited a few minutes and then the lady at the table next to us, told us that it would be best if we went up to the bar to order, because the service was really slow.  I did go up to the bar and it took forever for me to order us two beers.  Then I went back up to the bar to order food and it took even longer.  The place obviously was not up on the technology these days, so the bartender (pretty much the only person working...if you want to call it that) was using a calculator to figure out these two guys' bills.  It was totally frustrating, because she saw me standing there ready to place an order, which would have taken less than a minute, but she continued with these guys for at least 15 minutes until finally I could place my order.    When we got our food, the sliders were supposed to be pork (which I order a lot, so I know what it tastes like), but my husband and I are positive it was not pork.  By that time, the manager came over to finally greet us and make sure we were taken care of.  It was about time.  I really can't tell you how much this place sucked.

HOLY COW!!!  I never had thai food before, but I will definitely have many future dinners at Pete's Thai Cuisine.  I loved it.  The people were super nice and one of them was telling us a hilarious story about his recent birthday antics in vegas.  He made us feel completely comfortable.  The portion sizes were humongous, so it's probably a good idea to split something.  I got the Chow-mein thai style noodles with beef.  Amazing!!!  They ask you how spicy you want it on a scale of 1-5 ("1" being not spicy and "5" being OMG spicy).I recommend not going any higher than "3" on the spice and I'm a huge lover of spicy food.    If you're looking for a great thai cuisine experience, you have to go to Pete's.

A couple of friends, my husband and myself went here last Saturday night.  We arrived close to 10pm and in Old Town, that is still early for some people, so there weren't that many people there yet.  But that was the best time to get a drink.  Later on, we were fighting to get a bartender's attention.  However, with yelp, you do get 50% off your first drink.  The DJ played awesome music (old-school and now).  I would recommend this place.  It's 3 levels.  First level is pretty crowded once people start coming in and there's not really a dance floor, you just kind of start dancing there in the middle.  There is one go-go dancer on a small platform with a pole.  Don't get too excited, she's not that pretty nor does she seem interested in being there.  However, when she takes her breaks, almost immediately, the platform is now covered with 3-5 girls, who just want to dance.  It's good entertainment.    There happened to be a Bachelorrette Party there when we went and my husband was asked to do a magic trick...make his shirt disappear.  That was fun.    On the second level, there is beer pong and two more bars and you can look over the rail to the crowd below.  The third level is a patio with a bar.  I wouldn't recommend spending too much time up there unless you're a smoker.  There are, however, several patios or balcony's throughout all of Barney's.  They also have a food vendor cooking up pizza and hot dogs on the first level patio.  They weren't bad.  Overall, Barney's Boathouse is an all-around good time.

Now, I have only been here on a weekend night, so I don't know how it is during the day.  Before I was totally feeling the atmosphere and the music.  We went this past Saturday night and the bar service was horrible.  We literally stood at the bar for 15 minutes trying to close out our tab.  Unbelievable.  Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip.  My advice if you want to go here, do not open a tab and maybe you'll have faster service upstairs at one of those bars.

My husband brought me here.  Here after he had been a couple times and he knew exactly what we were going to have...the 20" cheese steak with sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms.  We of course split it.  It was awesome.  One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had.  It doesn't seem to be that busy in the evening, which is when we went.  That was nice, we didn't have to stand in line and got our food right away.  This place is nice change from the usual.

This place is a Chicago Bears bar and so, my husband and I, who are Bears' fans, thought that it would be nice to go further out of town for a change to watch the Bear's game.  We had been here once before and it wasn't anything spectacular.  This time around we sat at the bar.  Before I go any further, it's important to note that this place will reserve seats for you....During football season....on a Sunday....At the bar (or in booths)....  Have you heard of anything more ridiculous?  I've always been around Sunday Football and have learned that you need to get there early or you don't get a seat.  That's part of the package that comes with watching football at a bar or restaurant.  Anyways, we managed to find 2 of the few seats that were not reserved.  But, I know the people, who were sitting next to us had sat down before the "reserved" signs had been put up, so the Bartender later told them that those seats are reserved and the people who reserved them has until, I believe, the 2nd quarter to show up.  So, those people had to move (because the ones with the reservation were there).  We noticed that the bartenders were really nice to them and bringing them refills right away and chatting with them, while my husband had to wait a long time for them to bring him another beer, even after 2 of the bartenders walked by at least 10 times (no exaggeration).  So, basically, if you make reservations you get treated better, which doesn't make any sense.    Plus, the prices were ridiculous.  Especially, for the service and treatment we were getting.  I do not recommend going here.  Maybe the Buffalo Chip across the street treats their customers better.  This is really sad, because, I don't want this to reflect poorly on Chicago, or Bear's fans or anything associated with the two.  This place needs to figure things out and hire new staff.  The reservation thing needs to go.  That's just stupid.

Love Chipotle.  My only criticism is that some of the people making the burritos and tacos and such don't know what they're doing.  Sometimes, they aren't listening to what I am saying or they're very conservative on the portions, or they're just too slow.  I come here quite often and know who does a good job and who just gets in the way.  No matter what, whoever is at the register is always very nice....The place is always clean....Sometimes there's a line, but if the right people are making the food, then it doesn't take that long.  Love the burritos.

Not impressed.  I have been here twice.  The first time was just me and a girlfriend.  We were just grabbing a drink before going to a movie.  It had been open maybe a month by that time and it was pretty full.  Of course there were mostly male customers, which is to be expected.  I will admit that many of the servers are attractive.  However, I wonder if they have little experience serving or just don't like female customers.  I'm a server, so I don't feel bad criticizing.  You're supposed to get the customer to come back and you also want them to tell their friends.  My friend and I did not feel like a priority for the server, she did not spend much time talking with us at all.  For all she knew, we could have money to burn, but because of the service, she gets a crappy tip.  The second time I went, my girlfriend and I both brought our significant others.  There wasn't that much of a difference.  Once again, we were just grabbing drinks before a movie.  Maybe due to the fact that we weren't ordering food or staying longer, she didn't feel that she needed to put more effort into her service.  If you ask me, that's when I, as a server, spend more time making sure that the customer's visit is a positive one.  The server spoke very softly and didn't seem confident and lacked personality.  I wonder what qualifications these girls need to get hired....24" waist and at least a "C" cup??  At a nearby table, we saw a male customer massaging the shoulders of one of the servers, which we thought was highly inappropriate, but the server obviously didn't mind at all.  There are short video bios of each of the girls on several of their tv's.  It's pretty cheesy.  Oh yeah, they don't do frozen margaritas.  What the french toast.

I love to work out.  I was super excited when this location opened up.  I always went to the one around the corner, which closed.  This one has all new equipment and a lot of it.  It's all one level.  There's a basketball court, several raquetball courts, a group fitness room, spinning room, free weights, lots of cardio equipement and machines, plus it has an indoor pool and spa.  All the staff are super friendly.  It's always clean.  I would advise not to go from 4:30pm-7:30pm.  That time is crazy.  Granted, there is a lot of equipment to go around, but there are always those people who like to set up camp on the machine that you want to use.  And the reason for only 4 stars is that, it seems to take them awhile to fix anything that is broken like the cardio machines and the water fountain.

This laundry facility is awesome.  No quarters needed.  You just have a card, which is only $1 and then you add money to it as needed.  You never have to wait for a machine to open up because they have so many.  There are several places to fold your laundry too.  They have huge washers (double, triple and mega load machines).  I always bring my comforter here to wash and I'm in and out in no time.  I believe it's Tuesday and Thursday when they have special on the top load washers and discounted dryer loads.  Another plus,  The Blooze is in the same area, so you can head over there for a cocktail while you're waiting for your laundry to finish.

I didn't know what to expect when I arrived at Winco.  It is a huge warehouse type of store, which I liked.  The aisles were huge, there were a lot of different options, and there were some items that you could buy in bulk.  The items we bought were less expensive than the competitors prices.  The only item that we noticed was not cheaper than other places was the milk.  So, get the milk somewhere else, but everything else was a steal.

This place is awesome.  It's at a great location and easy to get to.  From the moment we walk in, we are greeted with a smile and a great attitude.  We've been here twice and each time has been great.  They serve thin crust pizza.  Try the Capicola.  They also brew their own beer plus they offer guest taps, which they change up ever so often.  Everyone is friendly and we love this place.

Made my original order, which came in 45 mins. Turns out my pizza was incorrect. ONIONS were on my pizza when I specifically asked for no onions. My husband called and said we were not happy. The manager assured they could rush a pizza out in 15-20 mins. 47 MINUTES later our correct pizza arrived. So in total, it took over an hour and a half to get a correct pizza delivered to our house( less than 1 mile away). Very poor customer service and a manager that just tells you what you want to hear. Thank you for ruining our dinner. And my 1 year old was asleep before the pizza got there....not acceptable.

I have heard so many good things about La Grande Orange and having this be a Yelp event, finally gave me a reason to go.  I loved the gelato.  The chocolate was my favorite.  I also tried the red velvet cupcake and a cinnamon roll.  I love red velvet, but I feel like the frosting was too sweet.  Now people who know me, know that I have a huge sweet tooth and for me to say something is too sweet, really means, it's too sweet.  The cinnamon roll was good, but I only like eating the inside part of it, because it's softer.  I loved that our location was "behind the scenes".  That was pretty cool.  All the staff was so nice and helpful.  Everyone was smiling.  There were goodie bags to take home too.  I thought that was really nice, since my husband was supposed to come with me, but got off work really late.  This way, I was able to bring him home some of the good stuff that he missed.  I do think I will go back.  The only issue I found was the parking.  I knew from driving past LGO on prior occasions, that parking was not going to be fun, but this time, when my destination was LGO, I really didn't know where to go.  There wasn't really any clear sign.  I saw that there is complimentary valet parking, but I wasn't sure where to pull into and each time I tried to pull into the teeny tiny parking lot, there were already at least 2 cars ahead of me with their rearends sticking out in traffic.  I ended up parking on a street down aways.  Be careful if you do this, though.  There are signs that tell you where you can't park.

Went to zipps around 4 o'clock on a Tuesday.  May have been a total of 20 people there.  A coworker and myself sat a a high top. 5 mins went by and no one acknowledged us. Finally walked to the bar to order. After our first beers came, a waitress showed up.  I believe her name was (Feather). She seemed ok and asked if we needed anything.  After I finished my first beer she came and asked if I needed another.  I got another and ordered wings at that time.  Beer came promptly.  Around this time the bar started to fill up.  Then 30 plus minutes went by, our beers were way past gone  others tables were getting food, and we had not seen our waitress (Feather ) or our wings. Ended up leaving hungry and pissed, way to go Zipps!!
