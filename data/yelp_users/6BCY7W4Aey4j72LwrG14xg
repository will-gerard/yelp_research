This is by far the worst pedicure I have ever had to sit through in my life to the point where I couldn't even allow them to touch my fingers. The "massage" consisted of dumping handfuls of lotion on to my leg and before it could be rubbed in completely more was added. She then had to rinse my legs off with alcohol. There was no pressure during the "massage" it was literally like she was petting my legs. Then she would lightly squeeze my big toe like you would do to a toddler... I asked to discontinue my service because it was literally torture and was told that I would pay $5 less than if I just completed the pedicure. Against my better judgement I continued only to have my nails cut too short and an uneven paint job applied. She clearly had no idea what she was doing. They are over priced and clearly undertrained. I would never step foot back in here again.

I'm a recent college graduate and was lost in the world of careers. I met with this company and Kent was so attentive to my personal needs. I felt he genuinely cared that I have the best resume to go after the jobs I desire and he really helped guide me through the process. He even helped learn to network online to increase my employment chances. I couldn't be happier with the results and would definitely recommend using this company.
