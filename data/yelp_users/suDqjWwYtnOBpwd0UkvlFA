Don't expect good customer service here! One girl to gift wrap on Valentine's Day The gentleman in front of me left upset after waiting and no one had wrapped his item yet. I asked the manager on duty if she could help the poor girl and she said she isn't trained to gift wrap and wouldn't help!! I guess she is above that job! Macy's for me next time!

Very disappointed! I've been coming here for years and NEVER again! My daughter and I had an appointment and while we were choosing colors felt rushed so I brought over 5 colors that I wanted to choose from. The technician scolded me like I was a child and told me not to drop them (on the floor or in my purse)! I assured her I wouldn't. She seemed irritated and when I tried to read the remote that was glued on the underarm of my chair, acted even more irked. She was extremely rough and even cut my toe. When I told her that she was too rough and the digging she was doing was painful, she told me that no she is not rough, she needs to clean underneath and my toenail was ingrown, which clearly it is not! I get pedicures at least once a month and have never had someone so rude and rough! She was obviously in a hurry and made what should have been a pleasant, relaxing experience,  a painful irritation.  My toe did not hurt until she cut it with her tool. Rather than acknowledging that it was too rough for me and being a little more gentle she proceeded to talk to the technician next to her in their native tongue (I'm sure about me) with occasional laughter. The leg massage was more like her getting a break to talk to her friend, not very attentive to the massage. At the end she did apologize and said she did not mean to hurt me. Even so, I've lost my faith in this establishment.

Omg! By far the BEST SUSHI in the Valley! Wow! The Crab Nigeria, the Special Spicy Tuna Roll and Salmon Nigeria highly recommended! So fresh! Do not mistake their small storefront for the delights that await inside!  So excited for our new find!

OMG! WTF? Completely amazing musicians jamming in Vegas on a Tuesday night! What a treat! I can't even decide who was the best from the trumpet to the keyboard to of course the amazing guitar, bass and drummer! Simply amazing! Dying! And great cocktails at a great price! I'm coming back to this place EVERY time I come to Vegas!

Who knew this little gem was right around the corner from my house right next to my neighborhood Sbux! Best Thai food I've had! We started with an appetizer, por Pia Sod! Healthy and delicious! We shared the Tom Kha soup and just loved the flavor the lemongrass and coconut milk gave this famous hot and sour soup! My husband and I shared two entr√©es, Red Curry with beef and Pad Thai with tofu, which we came no where near to finishing! Large portions and both were just superb! Medium heat was perfect for me but my husband would have preferred it with a little more heat! The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because they do not serve wine or beer so we saved money and did take out. It was hot and ready in 15 minutes! We will most definitely be regulars of this latest find!

Completely dissatisfied with this place and will not be returning! Went to a birthday party here where we paid in advance to partake of appetizers. $30 a head included am array of cheese cubes, a clump of blue cheese and some cooked veggies that were slimy and cold. The drinks were tiny pours in glasses with slanted bases to make it look like you are getting more than you are! To top it off the server decided to add her own gratuity of 22% and not tell us about it. There was just two of us on the bill. Our friend noticed his bill and the tip they added was higher than his entire bill! If you look out you may catch a nice view of the sunset but if you look down it's just brown dirt! Not good food, not good drinks, not good service! One star is generous!

Wow! Anyone who knows me, knows that I need variety and I am not a creature of habit! Think again! When it comes to Cafe Roma, I can't seem to leave this place alone! Love, love, love the food! Not to mention the owners! Antonio, Ana along with their son Marco, make you feel like you are part of the family! I'm so addicted to the Eggplant, I order it every time! I make sure to always taste my husband's dish, as he mixes it up and usually gets one of the nightly specials because he has never been let down! Tonight we had the mussels as an appetizer and loved them! They were so fresh and tasty and seemed to melt in our mouths! The Calamari is wonderful too and only lightly fried! My husband had a dish that consisted of pork shank with penne pasta and the meat  literally fell off the bone! No knife needed here!  If you find yourself in East Mesa and want GREAT food, this is the place! Not heavy Italian but light and delicious! You will thank me later!

This show is AWESOME!!!!  I went with a group of dance mom's and dancer's so we had some pretty hard critics with us and everyone loved it!!!  It was so entertaining!  The girls are extremely talented and beautiful!  The shorter blonde, Amy, is an amazing dancer!  We stayed in the lounge for a drink after the show and she came up to us, introduced herself and took pictures with us!  She was darling!!!  I have and will continue to refer people to this show and I will definitely be back to see it again!  Thank you for a most entertaining evening!!!

Great food! Wasn't really feeling Mexican food but the restaurant next door had an hour wait and we were hungry. Since we have had Mexican a lot lately I choose the Beet salad which was amazing! Very fresh and yummy! The guacamole was fresh and de lish! Street corn to die for! I had a bite of the  ahi fish tacos and LOVED it! The staff was friendly and accommodating! GM even stopped by our table to say Hi! Water never empty. Great place and we will return!

I'm picky and this place just wowed me! From the moment we walked in the staff was friendly and helpful! Kane recommended Pimms Cup as a not too sweet but refreshing cocktail and it was refreshing and tasty with cucumber and fresh mint! We shared the Street Tacos, Roasted Cauliflower and under Kanes direction the Pork belly skewers! All 3 were amazing! Honestly the best food I've had in a long, long time! Gavin, the owner came over to our table several times to see how we were liking it. We ended with the Churro Trio for dessert and loved every bite! Great place! I can't wait to go back for more!
