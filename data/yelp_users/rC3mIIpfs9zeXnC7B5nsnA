We got here just before the rush. I had the diablo burger which was Ã¼ber spicy but delishum. My girlfriend had the llano poblano burger which was also delishum. The truffle fries were good but not great. Our server, LoLo aka Lo aka Lolita was great! She had a great personality and was quick with refills. They have a unique selection of organic soda flavors too. We topped our experience off with some milkshakes and WOW!

It's been several years since I've been here and I see the name has changed from blue sage to stone grill. Along with that change came a change to the breakfast buffet, and not for the better. The price is the same, but the selection has dropped dramatically. I was also disappointed with the service. The place was empty and we saw our server twice while we were there. Doubt I will go back again. It's a shame because it used to be so good.
