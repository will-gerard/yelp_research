My quick summary:  Perfect for splurging on a romantic evening.  My fiance took me here last night for an overdue romantic evening together.  I had never been to The Melting Pot before because I didn't understand paying so much to cook most of your own food.  But if my sweetie is paying...  Well sure, why not?  :P  I was immediately impressed.  The hostess seated us immediately, took a complimentary picture for us and our waitress arrived to take our drink orders right away.  Their blackberry sage lemonade may just be my new favorite drink.  My fiance had a margarita, the waitress recommended it because she was also this evening's bartender and makes a mean Margarita. Well, she was right.  And our service was never lacking.  Quite a feat to bar tend and serve us all at the same time.  She also knew what changes had to be made to all the courses we ordered for my gluten free dietary needs, they're very well trained there.  The tables are small, intimate, and closed in by a curtain.  There is a small burner at the back of the table for the fondue pots to be heated up on.  The booths were quite comfortable.  And the low lighting certainly creates a romantic feeling.  The first course was a gluten free beer and cheese fondue with scallions on top.  They brought us bowls on fresh veggies (broccoli, cauliflower and carrots) and bowls of crisp Granny Smith apple slices.  I'd never eaten fondue and had no idea what to expect.  But the flavors were amazing.  It was creamy, cheesy goodness that was paired very well with the vegetable and fruit flavors.  The second course was a Wisconsin wedge salad.  This course was OK, but not my favorite.  It wasn't bad, but it's really just a partial head of iceberg, ranch, bacon and a flavorful cheese on the side.  This is just my prejudice.  I don't like only iceberg in salads.  It's bland and holds almost no nutritional value.  Our third course was the main meat course.  We got extra shrimp (had to substitute out some pasta), pork tenderloin, buffalo chicken, slices of beef, and more veggies.  They bring you sectioned plates for all the dipping sauces, a plum based one that's like a sweet & sour, a yogurt curry one, a creamy cheese one good with Buffalo chicken, and a creamy veggie dip.  They told us exactly how long to cook each meat so it gets cooked perfectly.  It was all seasoned perfectly with a small amount of heat.  Everything was quite flavorful.  Our dessert course was the S'mores chocolate & marshmallows, minus the graham cracker crumbles.  They were even kind enough to bring my fiance a small plate of rice crispy treats because those aren't certified gluten free, but he loves them.  And we shared a plate of large strawberry slices, pineapple, marshmallows, and banana slices.  One word: divine.  The chocolate was rich, creamy, and addicting, with a hint of marshmallow.  Their dessert is the perfect end to a romantic meal.  I've heard a lot of people complain about the price, but I think it is really a fair deal.  Now, hear me out before you throw rotten produce at me.  A full meal here takes at least an hour and a half, probably more like 2 hours, or more depending on this size of your party.  It does not have the quick turnover the vast majority of restaurants have.  And it's really about paying for the experience.  It's fun, romantic, and if you've never had fondue, a learning experience.  I think this will easily become my go-to romantic date night location...  However few and far between they may be.

If you're considering purchasing an engagement or wedding ring from this location, please think again.  My husband purchased my wedding ring set from here several years ago.  When we initially went to browse the rings the service was fantastic, everyone was so nice, it felt good purchasing from here.  And my wedding ring set he chose was gorgeous.  I loved it every day I wore it.  However, the maintenance for their pieces is terrible.  Any time I needed maintenance on my ring (repairing loose stones, re-treating of the white gold, etc), it took forever.  I think the shortest wait I had was exactly one week.  But it usually ran over a week, sometimes more than two.  And every time they gave one of two excuses.  Either the jewler was on vacation, or they were getting a rush because of a holiday coming up.    What holiday happens in Aug. that everyone needs their jewelry to look their best, I'm not certain.  And to rub salt in the wound, the staff is completely unapologetic if I had an event coming up that I wanted it done for earlier than that.  The last time I went (and vowed never to go back), I explained why I was hoping to get it sooner, the associate's response was, "So do you want it, or not?".  I never got any apology or empathy with them, but that was the worst.  My husband and I got so sick of their attitudes that we exchanged the set at Jared a few days ago, and purchased a new set there.  I own many Jared Neil Lane, Le Vian, & Smithsonian pieces, and all the same service is done within 2 hours, much better than about 2 weeks.  And even if I am going in for service instead of a purchase, they're so wonderful and attentive.  The attitudes at Helzberg ruined any chance of us wanting to do business with them again.

My husband brought me in here for the first time last Nov for a birthday present. I got a very nice sapphire heart necklace and matching charm bracelet. At the time a very nice Neil Lane diamond ring caught my eye, but was out of my husband's price range that night. I kept thinking about that ring for months, it was just gorgeous. I went back in March to see if they still happened to have it. I worked with an associate named Tirzah who helped me find and purchase my ring. They only had one very small size in stock, so she sent out a custom order for one to made for me so they didn't damage the integrity of the setting, since it had diamonds set down the sides. It was originally going to take up to 6 weeks to come in, but Tirzah got it rushed for me so I could wear it to my sister's wedding. Since then my husband and I have purchased a few additional pieces from Jared. Tirzah has always been there to help us. She really goes above and beyond to make sure we're happy with our purchase and find something I really love, and the jewelry itself is gorgeous.

Since writing this review, my husband and I have gone in to purchase a few other items from Jared, Tirzah in particular. She continues to offer the best customer service I've ever experienced. She treats you more like a best friend than a customer. She doesn't rush you, or try to convince you to buy something out of your price range. And she really commits to finding just the right thing for you, no matter how long it takes. And the other services (cleaning, resizing, etc) are quick, and very good. I really can't imagine going anywhere else for my pieces. I definitely suggest stopping by, and ask for Tirzah if you do!

My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.  I rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, but when I do, I always stop at KO's.  This is a nice, friendly neighborhood bar.  The owner is a nice guy, the staff is always friendly & courteous.  They have fun activities, like poker tournaments, on certain days.  They have TVs in every inch of the restaurant, so you never miss a game.  You can easily spend a couple hours here.  The menu is pretty amazing.  They have your basic bar food like potato skins, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  But, the manage to elevate their food to something surprising and unexpected.  Their chicken sandwich with pesto & cheese, so good & unexpected for a location like this.  Yet simple enough to make you wonder why other places can't manage good food like this.  I maintain their sweet potato fries are the best in the valley.  Their mac & cheese is worth the calories and cholesterol.  I ordered their grilled cheese one day, without tomatoes.  When it came, they forgot & added them by mistake.  Didn't bother me, I was willing to take them off.  But the waiter took it back, had them make me fresh one, and then took it off the bill.  All without me asking.  An excellent place to watch the big game or just pop in for a quick lunch.

My quick summary:  This is my favorite book store, and I'm a true bibliophile.  I don't often make my way up to the Scottsdale area, but when I do, I make it a point to stop at Poisoned Pen as often as possible.  You know you're in the right store by the outline of the body on the floor, fitting for a book store dedicated to mostly mysteries and thrillers.  The are also several other decorations from around the world hanging about, as the owner is an avid traveler.  The book selection is pretty unique.  They do not carry most genres of books, just a small sampling of everything except mysteries/thrillers.  However, the greatest advantage is being able to buy signed books.  They keep a lot of signed first editions on the shelves, so if you're a book collector (like me), have a favorite author, or are looking for a unique, personalized gift, this is the store for you.  The store is very nice and very knowledgeable about their product.  Several of them keep a small shelf stocked with books they've recently read and recommend for the customers.  The best thing about Poisoned Pen is the signings.  I've gone to several signings for some of my favorite authors (James Rollins, Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child to name a couple).  It's awesome to hear the authors talk about the book, what the inspiration was, what went into writing it, etc.  You also get a chance to ask questions of the author and have some 1:1 time with them as they sign your books.  The store also lets you pre-order books before they release, so you get a # assigned to you for the signing, so if you're on top of things, you don't end up at the back of the line.  :)

My quick summary: One of the best places I've been to eat, possible ever.  My husband and I went here last night to celebrate our anniversary.  My husband had made the reservation online.  It was great because it asked if we had any allergies, so he could let them know ahead of time that I'm gluten free.  They also asked if we were celebrating anything special, so he let them know if was our anniversary.  As soon as we walked in the door and let them know our names, they immediately wished us a happy anniversary, and grabbed me a gluten free menu.  When we got to the table we found they had created personal menu inserts, congratulating us on our anniversay, brought us a complimentary glass of champagne, and let us know the chef had prepared for us an anniversary tasting menu (gluten free for me) if we wanted to go off the regular menu.  It was truly memorable.  The tasting menu was amazing, simply amazing.  The started with a shrimp & scallop appetizer.  Scallops are one of my favorite things, and this was cooked perfectly.  They brought us a small plate of steamed edemame, and the seasoning was super delicious.  The next course was ahi tuna poke.  It was a little spicy, but the cucumber and avacado they served it with toned it down and made it perfectly balanced.  We were then served butterfish bites.  I have to say, that is one of the best things I've ever eaten, hands down.  It served with a ginger glaze and a little wasabi.  I could have eaten a whole portion of that.  We also had a small salad of arugala, dates, panchetta, and a white balsamic dressing.  It was so light and refreshing.  All the flavors just exploded in your mouth.  The main course consisted of steak and a half lobster.  The lobster was buttery, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The steak was served with a red wine ver blanc.  The official dessert was their chocolate souffle, but as a surprise they served a mini dessert for us with chocolate cake and creme brulee.  They decorated the plate to say Happy Anniversay and took a complimentary picture for us.  Those mini desserts were divine.  Then came the souffle, I'd been eager to try it for about a week.  It did not disappoint.  The chocolate was rich, the inside was gooey chocolate goodness.  Between the experience of all the managers & our server catering to our anniversary and the amazing food, my husband and I are guaranteed to become regulars here.

My quick summary: Fabulous dining for any reason.  My fiance and I usually go here in the evenings for date nights.  But yesterday my 10 coworkers and I went her for a work lunch.  I was amazed at how smoothly the service went for 11 people.  Our waitress was fantastic and the food was amazing, as always.  Since I've dined here before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, I'll just go ahead and tell you about all the food, versus just what I ate yesterday.  They start you out with loaves of fresh baked bread and butter.  The crust is crispy, perfect, divine & I have no idea how they accomplish that.  I wish my baking experiments came out that well.  They were more than willing to bring out many, many loaves for the carb addicted hordes at our table.  The appetizers the table shared as a group were the lobster spinach dip, smoked chicken wings, and onion rings.  I, myself, have only tried the lobster spinach dip.  It is hands down the best I have ever had.  It has just the right about of lobster so that you actually can get a bit in every bite.  I did not get to try the onion rings or wings, but they looked amazing.  There was no excess oil or anything to make either appetizer looks slightly soggy.  Everyone raved about how wonderful & perfectly cooked everything was.  I got to sit in watch in extreme envy.  Woo boy.  For my entree I had the Aspen sirloin and loaded baked potato.  I ordered my steak medium rare, and shockingly, it was a true medium rare.  Most places overcook it and bring out a medium.  Not Firebird's.  And it was so juicy and delicious.  The baked potato was also amazing.  My only complaint was that they outside was pretty salty.  But, unlike most people, I am not a huge salt person.  I like spicier and/or other flavors, not so much salty ones.  So I chalk this up to my own personal taste.  It had bacon, chives, sour cream, cheese, all the goodies.  I also have to rave about their pecan crusted trout with peach salsa that I've has before.  I'm not usually a fish person, but I am a salsa person so it caught my eye.  And I ate every bite.  That fish & salsa is addictingly good.  The group ordered an array of dessert combos and there was no complaints from anyone.  They even brought one friend a small bowl of vanilla ice cream because she wasn't hungry enough to eat a real dessert, the wimp.  Best of all, the service was continuously prompt.  Our waitress checked on us every couple of minutes for drinks, etc.  And they delivered all our dishes within moment of each others, so no one was watching other people eat, etc.  Can't wait to go back again!

My quick summary:  Sky's the limit with burger invention and fresh ingredients.  I absolutely love Blu Burger.  I've always found traditional burgers so boring.  Blu Burger is my burger mecca.  They have too many ingredients to list (meat types, bun types, toppings, sauces, etc), so you can mix & match, combine, and taste test to you heart's desire.  The staff is friendly, super attentive, and quite charming.  There's never a long wait for anything.  And they really treat you like family.  They will work with any request you have.  I wanted to try a couple different toppings & sauces to find what I liked best.  So, to cater to my known insanity, they brought everything out on separate little plates & bowls for me.  I settled with goat cheese & green chilies on a black Angus burger on a whole wheat bun.  The burgers are always cooked to perfection.  They have options for meat lovers & vegetarians alike.  The fries are always crispy & delicious.  Their side salad is always super fresh & crisp.  They're even kind enough to bring the dressing on the side, so it's never a case of no dressing or drowned in dressing.  A am now a proud regular & will not be leaving any time soon.

My husband and I have used this company twice now, and could not be happier with their work and results.  Both times we had a two man crew, and a 26 foot truck.  The company is great at giving you a very realistic quote over the phone, before they even show up at your door.  The first time we used them, they said it would be a 3-4 hour job, and sure enough they got it done in just over 3 hours.  I loved them so much, I went back through all my old records from years ago, just so I could make sure to hire them for my move today.  They just finished moving us into our new condo today.  When I spoke to them originally, and described the job, they guessed it would be 4.5-6 hours.  Sure enough, they finished in a little over 5.  These guys know what they're doing.  They take excellent care of your belongings, and are super friendly.  They bring all the tools they might need to get the job done.  For our first move, we didn't realize our dining table was too wide to fit through the door, so they guys brought in the tools, separated the top from the base, and reassembled for us at our new place.  This is really the best company for the job.  If we ever have any moving needs in the future, we will definitely use Just-In Time Moving and Delivery again.

My quick summary:  Deliciously surprising.  So my younger sister had been trying to take me for some chicken & waffles for years.  But, me being the stubborn mule that I am, I dug in my heels.  I was stuck on my idea that fried chicken & waffles are not a natural combination, as this was not the food I was raised on and I don't even like waffles.  Boy was I wrong.  My sister had a insane pregnancy craving while we were out together one day & demanded I take her to Lolo's that very moment.  Who am I to argue with a seven-month pregnant woman who is like 6 inches taller than me?  I am proud to say I caved like the cowardly lion.  My first impression on the atmosphere leaned towards the positive side as the place was packed on a weekday, during lunch.  And the colors are bright & exciting.  The desserts were displayed in cases on the counter & looked mouthwatering.  The waiter was funny, friendly & very helpful.  I am not a Kool-Aid drinker, so he brought me his own concoction of rd Kool-Aid mixed with lemonade.  One word: addicting.    I ordered the Tre Tre, which comes with a couple legs & a waffle, a side of mac & cheese & banana pudding for dessert.  The chicken I ate first, being not that big a fan of waffles.  It was divine.  The spices on the skin are amazing, best I've ever had.  The mac & cheese was creamy and rich.  I even loved the waffle.  It is cooked perfectly, and has a hint of cinnamon.  And I don't usually eat pudding, but I will order that there whenever possible.  There was not a crumb left on my plate.  I now take any family & friends there if we happen to be in the area.  And they never disappoint.

My quick summary:  A really yummy place to eat, but please make reservations.  My fiance and I gathered both our families here for a Sunday brunch to make sure we had all our wedding details finalized.  We knew we'd have a large party and didn't want to wait, so we made reservations.  What a great idea that turned out to be.  This places is PACKED on Sundays.  People walked in, took a look at the crowd, and walked out.  I felt bad for the crowd waiting as they don't have a lot of benches, etc, to sit down on.  Some bales of hay, with blankets thrown over them.  Not my cup of tea, but I know they're trying to stick with the country theme.  We were all seated fairly promptly.  The waitress came by immediately to get our drink orders, but informed us they hadn't gotten their soda delivery so Coke & Diet Coke were not an option (tear).  Our food came fairly quickly.  I had a house omelet with green chilies, chorizo, and a mixture of cheeses.  The omelet was good, but very chorizo heavy.  I found myself search for other flavors.  The hash browns were also crispy and yummy.  Several people at the table ordered their biscuits and gravy & said it was ridiculously delicious.  The kids with us had some of the biggest pancakes I've ever seen.  Overall the service and food was very good.  I'll have no problem going back in the near future.

My quick summary:  Spinatos is a gluten free Italian heaven.  I have a gluten intolerance, so my fiance and I have to have gluten free pizza crust.  Sounds simple, but it is super hard to find a good one.  Spinatos has made an art out of it.  It does not taste like it's made of anything but regular flour.  We ordered it for delivery, and they have mastered the art of under-promising and over-delivering.  They told us it would be 45-60 mins, but it was more like 35.    Their pizza sauce manages to be the perfect combo of sweet & tangy all at the same time.  The ratio of cheese & toppings was perfect.  It's even good cold for leftovers.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the gluten free pizzas came in larger sizes.  My fiance & I had to order 2 of them, as he can pack away the pizza & I wanted some too.

As much as I hate to do it, I have to amend my original review and take a way a couple of stars from Spinato's.  I am very upset to learn that I have been mis-informed several times by their managers about certain items on the menu being gluten free.  Originally, I was told by their manager that all bone-in wings were gluten free because they had their own dedicated fryer.  Shortly after that, a delivery guy informed us my favorite wings, the spicey chili, were not gluten free.  The manager I spoke to about that informed me only certain sauces were gluten free, mild, medium and hot.  I ordered some pizza and wings this past weekend.  I was called & informed that none of their wings have ever been gluten free, that they have never had a dedicated fryer.  Shame on Spinato's for mis-informing me on several occasions and jeopardizing my health, and anyone else's with an allergy, in the process.  Some things I was told were completely false.  I immediately attempted to contact their corporate office about this & asked them to consider re-training for their staff and managers.  I have not received any response or apology from them.  I am removing them from my gluten free favorites list and will be giving it some serious thought as to whether or not I want to order from them in the future.

I have been patronizing this location for year, at least once a week with friend and family since we all  live in the neighborhood and love sports.  Recently everything has gone downhill and the quality of food is terrible.    The wings (something they used to be known for) are awful.  They are not tossed in the sauce, as they used to be.  Now they pile them on the platter and dump the sauce in just one spot, making those couple of wings soggy & inedible.  They have also grown consistently smaller.  They actually served me one wing that was about an inch and a half long.  It looked like it came off a baby chick, rather than a full grown chicken.  Everything tastes like it is just being reheated in the microwave.    The overall quality of  the food is going down fast, most noticeably with the wings.  The only thing they still manage to do well is pizza.  But, with its host of other problems, is not worth returning for.    I tried to contact them to provide my group's feedback.  All I got was a system generated email letting me know someone would be contacting me shortly.  I have waited almost 8 weeks, and still have not heard anything.  My friends and family will not be returning to Native New Yorker.

My quick summary:  Ice cream will never satisfy you again.  That's right.  Never.  I'm sorry to say that for most of my life I had bad taste, and didn't even know it.  I loved ice cream growing up.  Who didn't?  Well, after discovering Frost, I can't eat ice cream anymore.  Gelato has only been in my life a few years.  But now I know what I've been missing out on.  If you've never tried gelato, there are some major differences you need to be aware of.  First, ice cream is packed with air, so it's not as great a flavor compared to gelato.  Second, gelato is MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH (like whole freaking bunches) creamier.  And third, it has way less calories and fat.    Frost is a truly unique experience.  The creators tried to be authentic as possible.  The majority of their ingredients and all of their equipment is imported from Italy.  Their master gelato chef?  He's from Italy too.  And you can tell.  The flavors are amazing.  They even have an extensive sorbet collection.  When you first walk in you're greeted by a display with dozens of flavors, all masterfully decorated to look like works of art (candied sugar, champagne corks and flavorful swirls, oh my).  A couple flavors even change monthly, to go with the season.  Oh peppermint, how I miss you.  I ended up taking like a gallon of that stuff home to gorge myself upon...  But that's another story.  The staff are extremely friendly and polite.  There will wait upon you while you sample flavor after flavor until you find the perfect one to purchase.  Their best selling flavor is sea salt caramel.  And you can pair it with almost any other flavor to make your second choice even better.  And if you're not a straight gelato fan & want to get ll kinds of inventive treats, they accommodate those wishes as well.  You can get a milk shake, gelato infused coffee beverage, etc.  And their milkshakes are insanely good.  My fiance & I like to share a large one (more flavor combos available).  The best thing we've ever had there is a banana, chocolate, peanut butter crunch and seas salt caramel shake.  They even sell gelato cakes and other yummy treats for special occasions.  So if you're looking for a truly life altering dessert or sweet snack...  Go to Frost.  They will not disappoint.

My quick summary: Not even up to par for bar food.  My fiance and I visited this location one Sat night because we didn't want to cook & it was close by.  We're on the hunt for a nice bar to go & enjoy football games at once the season starts.  The first that struck us was the decor.  You can easily identify this location used to be a Hooters.  It just looks like they took the decorations out.  They've added nothing to it.  There was hardly anyone in the bar, maybe 5-6 other tables.  The waitress took an extremely long time to come and take our orders.  We ordered the red pepper poppers as an appetizer, my fiancé ordered hot wings for his entrée, and I ordered the BBQ pork sliders with wasabi slaw.    The food took way too long (at least 25 mins to arrive).  I don't know how it took so long, considering the quality of the food.  We noticed a couple of things immediately.  The poppers did not come as an appetizer as requested, they brought them with the rest of the meal.  The BBQ pork sliders looked dry & old.    I can easily say, the poppers were the best part of the meal.  They were creamy with just enough heat.  I'd eat them any day of the week.    The wings were nothing to write home about. They were fine, but not great.    The BBQ sauce on the pork wasn't that flavorful, and it was quite obvious they scooped the BBQ pork out of a pan that had cooked quite some time ago.  The buns were stale and kinds of hard.  It was truly disappointing.  The biggest insult, though, was the wasabi slaw.  How can you claim to have a wasabi slaw when it has no wasabi whatsoever?  It was just plain coleslaw that was something you can buy at any grocery store & slap on a plate.  There was no spice, nothing exciting about it.  It was even a little watery.  We will not be dining there again.

My quick summary:  Great food & more than prepared to work with dietary restrictions.  I know a lot of people complain about the noise level, but I happen to like it.  It really kind of goes with the whole experience.  The staff was really knowledgeable.  They knew what gluten free meant, and even the cashier knew off the top of her head that they had dedicated fryers, so the fries are also gluten free.  Most places look at me like I have eye growing out of my forehead.  And they'll customize your burger any way you like it.  Did you know they'll grill the jalapenos if you ask them?  I did.  :)  The soda machines are, in one word, awesome!  It's a touch screen.  You pick your drink type & it allows you to add flavor shots.  May I recommend the light cherry lemonade?  Great way to start a meal.  The burgers were perfect.  I watched the guy behind the line tenderly wrap mine in lettuce, since I can't have a bun.  And he then re-wrapped it after making sure the proper condiments had been put on (the guy in charge of that apparently wasn't sure).  The burger was wrapped so well, it really resembled a bun & I could have picked it up & eaten it with my hands, no problem.  The fries were warm, delicious, and plentiful.  They were seasoned perfectly.  My fiance & I shared a small order with our burgers, and there were still some left over.  Should have taken them to work & tortured my coworkers with the smell...  Oh well, there will always be next time.

My coworker and I went here last Friday for lunch.  We ordered 45-60 minutes ahead of time online. The instructions said when we got there to go straight to the pick up area for our food. When we arrived it was a few minutes after our pick up time, the place was packed and two guys behind the counter wouldn't acknowledge us or meet our eyes. After a few minutes I was finally able to get one of their attention. We informed him we were there to pick up our online order. The guy at the pick up station asked the guy at the register if he had any online orders. The guy at the register gave us a deer in the headlights look, they hadn't even printed them. The guy at the pick up station told us our order came in just before a rush, he offered no apology. They then put our orders on the line, behind everyone in the lunch rushes orders. We asked what was the point of ordering online? They guy just said it depends on the day, some days they get a rush and some they don't, again no apology or offer to expedite our order. Apparently online orders don't matter of a rush comes in. We had to wait quite a while to finally get our food and rush back to work, they still never apologized for the delay. I ordered a BLT bowl with turkey, ham, bacon, pepper jack, lettuce and spicy ranch. I got 95% shredded iceberg lettuce and 5% meat and cheese. It was a disappointing visit and meal. An apology or some kind of gesture to show that they cared about fixing their mistakes would have gone a long way to help the situation. This was my first and last visit.

I absolutely love this place.  Bosa always has the freshest, largest pastries.  These are not donuts made at a factory and then shipped to individual locations.  My favorite type of donuts are jelly filled.  Bosa always guarantees there will be actual jelly in the donut.  It's not like Dunkins or Krispy Kremes where all the jelly is in one little blob at the very back of the donut.  These have a good jelly to donut ratio.    Really, every flavor I've ever tried here is good.  Their glaze is melt in your mouth amazing.  And they even have options if you prefer savory options.  Sometimes my hubby and I will go here before the grocery store for breakfast and just grab a ham, cheddar, and jalapeno filled croissant.  The staff is always pleasant and will do their best to accommodate special requests (like my husband asking that his croissant be warmed up).  Definitely stop in when you get a chance!

Me, my friends, and my family (a party of 16) visited this location on Sat. for my birthday.  I've been to this Lolo's, and the one in Scottsdale previously, so I was confident this would be a great place for everyone to enjoy.  We called ahead and let them know we had a large party coming.  They don't take reservations, but just a few minutes after they arrived they'd made a large section for our group on the patio, so we could all sit together.  The weather was perfect for us to all sit outside and relax.  Our server, Andrea, arrived promptly to take our drink orders.  She was very friendly, and anticipated we'd need a lot of seperate checks.  We were very happy we didn't have to ask for seperate checks, since there were so many of us.  But she rocked it, and was totally prepared.  All the drinks came out quickly & correctly.  The food, to everyone's surpise and delight, came out not long after the drinks.  For a party of 16 people, you expect there to be a few errors here and there.  There was only 1 small one, my husband's meal came with 1 chicken breast, instead of 2, which Andrea recognized, and got corrected in just a moment.  His plate was back with the other piece of chicken by the time the rest of the food was served.  I got 2 drumsticks, a waffle, and a side of mac 'n' cheese.  Their fried chicken is perfect.  It's crisp & not oily on the outside, and juicy and tender on the inside.  Everyone absolutely loved their chicken.  The waffles are fantastic.  I always eat the whole thing, and I usually hate waffles.  Lolo's is the only place I will eat one, and love every bite.  The mac 'n' cheese was great too, no complaints, super yummy.  Several of my friends got their "Big Azz Sandwich", and went nuts for them.  Everyone in our group loved their meal.  There wasn't a single complaint, except about how we could not eat another bite.  The only thing that I think was better than the food, was the service.  Not only was it well above average for what you expect dining out, but is was beyond our expectations for a party that large.  Every single person there commented on how great it was.  We will all definitely be back.
