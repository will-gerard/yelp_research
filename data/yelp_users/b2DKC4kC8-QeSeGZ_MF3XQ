Not the best part of town but they do have security in the parking lot.  Food is pretty decent Mexican food.  Chips and salsa suck but the desserts like the flan are to die for.  The place is huge inside. Service is generally pretty good. I would recommend.

Gotta love this store.  Almost like taking a trip south of the border.  Authentic Mexican Bakery, frescas and a nice eating area with both the normal everyday burros/tacos you see everywhere but with other goodies as well. Fresh flour tortillas and a good butcher shop and cheese shop.  A great place to take visitors to also to get a taste of the Southwest.

This place is great.  No name on the building, somewhat sketchy neighborhood but the burritos are oh so delicious.  The green chili is to die for.  Ne inside seating but a little patio outside.

Would love to give more stars but what a cheapass place.  Ordered a milkshake at 7:59, by the time it arrived it was after 8:00. They are offering their half price shakes after 8:00. Even though it was delivered after 8:00 they wouldn't give it to me at half price because I ordered it one minute too soon.  I hate lazy workers who don't want to be bothered making things right for a customer.

Very small shop with a limited variety of items, however the items they do carry are outstanding.  Nice selection of cold cuts, loved the jerky.  They have a brown bag special that while it doesnt blow you out of the water is satisfying.   They have a sampler platter but you have to ask what the items are because there is no description.

If you don't like grease than don't come here.  The food is so greasy I can see how it can turn some people off but it is oh so good.  The fries are crispy and the Italian Beef and Italian sausage sandwiches are great.  If I have a complaint it that there is not enough giardena put on when you order it, plus it is placed on top of the sandwich and half of it always seems to fall off.  Soda's are on the low end of the soda chain, who serves RC? Really?  Dripping good sandwhiches- no need to ask for it wet.

Yes, the on the food network sign is incredibly tacky but the food is better than most Italian places. Actually we found it hit or miss. My wife loved the gazpacho soup, I thought the house salad was so so, the garlic bread wasn't very good but our main courses were pretty good. I had the spaghetti and had a couple of meatballs. I thought the meatballs were extremely well done. The service was attentive, they had to be because the water and iced tea glasses were only like 6 oz glasses so they had to come by and constantly refill them.

Interesting little butcher shop/german market next to OHSO.  Rather small selection but what we bought looked fresh and tasty.  The smoked pork chops are to die for.  Not much variety in the 'market' either but what they had looked authentically German including mustard, pickles and snacks.  They also threw a little something in our bags for free.  Only knock is needs more inventory.

Who knew this place was here. Located in South Phoenix in an area you wouldn't expect it.  Great for it's picnic type atmosphere and good old school healty food.  Don't forget to try the desserts as they are heavenly.  Summertime it is a great breakfast place on Saturdays but arrive early or you may have a wait.

The food here is your typical national chain nothing special food although the cookie dessert is to die for. Decent size bar area. Ordered an Old World Brewing beer that was disgusting. Sent it back and the bartender said he would have no problem taking it off the bill, he said it wasn't the first time someone had sent that beer back.  Pizzas are ok and probably the go to menu item.  The places really needs a decor upgrade, it feels like someplace from the late 80's in there.

Rather disappointed in this location.  The soda machine was out of ice and was not filled after I told them about it, and they did not have any of the vanilla flavoring powder to be able to add vanilla to your iced coffee but the worst thing was the amount of cream cheese on my bagel was barely noticeable, it was like they wer spreading butter onmy bagel instead of cream cheese.  Sorry but when I order a bagel with cream cheese I expect there to be cream cheese on it. Other than that it is just your typical corporate Einsteins.

Very clean well run store.  Great little dessert area and prepared food area. Has a small but adequete salad bar area.  Great for when you want something a little bit more upscale but without having to pay an arm and a leg.  Prices are higher than other grocery stores but so is the quality.  Nice beer and wine section. Lots of fresh produce and a good butcher shop area..

Love the deli here. It is always clean with good food choices. The candies and pastries are great also.  We stopped in to grab some dessert and ended up getting some other items to nosh on later since the other place we had just eaten at nearby had horrible food.  Wish they had more AJ's around.

While I am not usually a fan of corporate restaurants and brewpubs, BJ's in Chandler is an exception to the rule. The beer is fresh as it is brewed on site and they usually have a couple of offerings that set them apart from the main street amber ale brewpub crowd. The best deal is the all you can eat soup and salad at lunch for around $8.00. Food is above average pub food and the pizzas are a ok. They also make root beer for the kids.

Went here because they were supposed to have a nice craft beer selection, which they did. However if I am going to buy premium priced beer I want it to be kept in a cooler and not just sitting out.  No, thanks, won't be back.

For North Scottsdale this is about as good as it gets for a sports bar.  Lots of tv's although they could be updated to high definition. Food is pretty typical sports bar food. Decent wings, overcooked burgers. Your typical sports bar beer selection could be easily improved with a few more microbrews.

Two words describe this place, Old School.  The restaurant and bar area are certainly dated, kind of like a throwback to the 60's or 70's and could certainly use a makeover and the food is Old school Italian as well which is actually just fine with me as there is nothing better to me than an heaping portion of spaghetti and meatballs to bring back old family memories. Service was friendly and food came out fairly fast.

The customer service in the individual departments is really good, I especially like the meat department people, however the customer service people in the customer service area need to work on their customer service skills.  While waiting they are prone to spend time on the phone helping people not in the store rather than people in the store.

Pretty decent Mexican food, certainly not the best around but not bad either.  Service was outstanding, The salsa that comes with the chips is very mild-too mild for me but certainly quaffable.  The Margaritas are pretty good and my wife was happy they had Papago Orange Blossom beer that certainly goes well with Mexican food.  We will return.

Your typical Sonic, busy and slow service is more the norm at this location than other locations, however I also have to wonder about the cleanliness of this location.  Looking in through the window you could clearly see the lemonade machine was dirty and probably hadn't been cleaned in awhile.

Ok, Not the best part of town nor the nicest looking restaurant around, however the food is outstanding. Sonoran style Mexican food at its finest. Way better than Filbertos or LosTaquitos.  The green chili has a nice roux base and the carne asada tacos have a great blend of onions and FRESH chilies blended in.  The hot sauce is pleasently spicy.  Kind of unusual but great for parties is that they sell many items in bulk quantities for a nice discount.

Not our normal stomping grounds but was driving back from Flagstaff and wanted to stop in and get some dinner and watch the game.  Place is most definently a sports bar with your typical sports bar food that leans on Italian.  Food came out fast an was tasty.  My biggest complaint is about the lack of good craft beer. The have some but could do a much better job and really elevate this place and ween people off of bud miller coors.

Good German food and beer although the beer choices were pretty much the larger German Beer companies.  A couple of local places, Four Peaks and Huss both make excellent Kolsch beers that would do well on the menu here to have some fresh beer.  My only complaint about the food is that mine was drenched in gravy and my apple strudel was also swimming in the vanilla sauce )not that it was bad but just a little too much and the salad bar was pretty minimal,

Typical KFC, this review is more of a slam on the corporate KFC for the ripoff they are doing by selling us Nashville wings.  Nashville Wings are really the same crispy chicken with hot sauce and a couple of pickle slices added for an extra $2.00 (for the 8 pack).  Pure ripoff.

If you are looking for an old fashioned ice cream parlor this is the spot.  The food is also old school diner type food, the meatloaf is pretty good, but it is meatloaf after all, not a porterhouse steak.  The desserts are rich and the ice cream is decent, wish they would have more flavors though.  The servers are mostly young High School age kids who sometime spend too much time talking with their friends.  It is what it is.

Really good prime rib. Beware can be a long wait this time of year with spring training in full bloom. We waited over an hour and a half for a table. On street parking can also be an issue. Typical old town Scottsdale overpriced but you are paying to be in old town and the experience.  Food was good, but not sure if it was worth the wait.

Can you say Old School or dive steakhouse?  This is it.  The food is good as well as the frosty beverages.  The bar is ultra small and very much like a dive bar but beyond the astetics the food is wonderful.  Some items like the ribs are priced in line with what you would expect of a steakhouse but some things are expensive.  The soup is rad and big portions of fries.

Planned a party night out at Papago Brewing which is around the corner from the Best Western and knew we weren't going to be in any shape to drive.  What a smart idea. Hotel is kind of old but the prices were great and the location couldn't be beat. The staff was nice and the place was clean and quiet. Certainly not an upscale resort but it serves it purpose well. Would highly recommend if you are going to any Spring training games as the A's and Giants are super close.

The setting is in your typical strip mall as is all the good places it seems these days.  The place is small and the decor kind of sparse and cheesy Chinese but who cares, the food is what counts.  It was all very good and the prices were very reasonable.  I really enjoyed the General Tso's chicken, just the right amount of smice.  My wife enjoyed her sesame chicken and we both had a fair amount of leftovers for lunch the next day.  Has a small bar where you can get exotic cocktails.

Not really much of a grocery store but a great little deli and restaurant.  I had a wonderful calzone that was enough for two meals.  My friend had a sandwhich with a side of antipasti salad that looked really good as well.  A small selection of wine and beer but the reason to go here is all about the food.  Didnt try the desserts but might next time if I have room.

Four Peaks is a classic institution.  Not only is the building a really cool old building they have the best patio in town. The beers are consistently good and the food is above reproach with fantastic daily specials, some of which you'd only find at high end restaurants. The only knock is that because of the lack of a/c you have to rely on swamp coolers and misters to stay cool in the summer, but hey, that is covered by having Four Peaks North in Scottsdale.   P.S. The ASU student waitresses aren't bad either.

Love this place, major problem is that there is always a wait on the weekend and no reservations.  My other knock is that they have some crazy pricing-while some items are certainly reasonable such as a side pork chop for $4.75 how can you justify $4.00 for a side of cottage cheese.  Breakfast is fairly old school but with a lot of nice specialties.

I gave it 4 stars because my wife loved it even though I thought it was just ok.  The food was good but the bloody mary I ordered was very small and I've had a lot better. Imagine adding vodka to spicy v8 juice and calling it a bloody mary? Weak.  It was a bad day for the staff when we were there, some kid spilled a drink on the floor, then the manager was carrying a cappuchino over to a table and slipped on it and made a bloddy mess.  I did notice that no one got around to making another cappuchino for the people that ordered it but the staff was obviously discombobulated.

Located just off Mill Ave.  When the weather is nice it has a great patio. Inside is a total dive. Pretty decent food but it is a total drunk fest type of place. Lots of ASU kids and a whole host of regulars whose sole purpose in life is just to hang out and get drunk.

Normally I wouldnt waste my time reviewing a fast food restaurant but the service at this KFC is a joke.  I've gone twice the past few months and it has been horrible.  Today the person working the register was also having to expedite the orders which made things super slow.  What was crazy was that the guy behind me ordered a chicken pot pie and they said it would take 35 minutes...and he decided to wait for it.   This place needs to hire more staff and TRAIN them.

I am still a fan of this place even if it seems to have gotten a little stale. Nothing ever changes here, including the daily specials. It would be nice to see some new menu items.  Salsa and chips are always good and HOT. We love the chorizo dip. Adovada ribs aren't the best, they really should try to get better meat.  The marq's are tasty but a little overpriced. All that said it is a favorite of guests from out of town due to its charm and hot food.

If you don't like hot spicy food don't go here. Starting with the salsa it is a pure capascium burn. Really tasty. I prefer the Mesa location over the Phoenix location based solely on the fact that I rarely have to wait, while at the Phoenix location (Which has more ambience) there is often a wait.  I love the chorizo dip, even if it isn't listed they will make it for you. The green chili is also very good. Service is generally very good, even on a Friday night.

Very Hipsterish type place in the Scottsdale civic center area.Very clean with a good cocktail menu but limited and uninspiring beer choices. Food was good, house made chips were excellent as an appetizer and I had the burger au pouive II which is a blue cheese bacon burger with a lot of black pepper. I ordered it medium well and it came out very well done....to say the least-closer to bone dry but the addition of some mustard made it a lot better. Service was good and attentive even though the waiter didn't seemed that enthusiastic or happy.

On the weekends this place gets packed so make a reservation.  My wife and me ordered a app, soup and an entree.  Got the guac that was tasty but small portion.  Then we were served the entree. When asked about the posole soup we had ordered they said they'd have it right out.  Was almost done with the entree by the time it came. The waiter said he would be right back with the cabbage and lime that was supposed to be with the soup. Well it never came until we asked 2 other times. Horrible service-props for tasty food.

Great selection of ecletic spices and herbs.  Yes, the prices are higher than the grocery stores but you shouldn't be buying spices at Penzeys that you can get at a grocery store.  They have a number of different chili blends that make some of the best chili you will ever have.  Everything always seems very fresh.

Nice little neighborhood strip bar bar and grill.  Decent selection of beers including a few locals.  Food is the main reason people come here.  Burgers are big 1/2 pound burgers.  Plenty of other options including salads and steaks.  Service was good and friendly.  Our waiter said he has worked there 10 years so that says something about the place.  Looking forward to trying their weekend brunch during football season.

Sort of like a poor mans version of Ruth Chris's steak house  or a rich mans version of Frasher's steak house.  Food was good but not great. Service was very good.  Plenty of wine choices but very limited beer menu. I find it a shame when you have a nice place that thinks that wine is cultured but beer is not.

Very casual place, great if you want to play some volleyball or horseshoes. I'm a fan of the cook it yourself grills.  Not a big fan of the food they prepare for you though.  The beer selection usually has 1 or 2 drinkable beers but their selection is mostly a bunch of the big watered down beer companies or pseudo fake micros like Blue Moon.  You can also bring your dogs and kids which is a plus and a minus for some people. Great for group outings.

Cheap and for a reason.  Arrived to pick up the car and only had one agent working with 5 people waiting.  They were out of the size car we wanted so he gave us an upgrade from an intermediate car to a huge suburban.  The next day one of the tires had a slow leak in it and the sensors came on, added air and sure enough 6 hours later needed to add more air.  Called e-z about it and had to leave a message, of course they never returned the call.  Left a second message the next day. Of course no call back again.  Ended up having to add air multiple days over the next couple of days,  Cheap cars but dont expect any help should anything go wrong.

Had about a 10 minute wait which was surprising since there were open tables but it was worth the wait.  Decor is nice, slightly trendy-slightly rustic.  Service was excellent.  A little bit after we ordered the waitress came out and apologized that the kitchen was slow and offered us soup and some bread complimentary.  Right after that arrived so did the food.  The wifes burger wasnt cooked to order and they fixed it promptly.  The service is what made up for the little wait and the kitchen error.  Would highly recommend.

Great store to get slightly used designed clothes, shoes, suits, etc.  They also must have a deal with Tommy Bahama to get all their older clothes because they always have a ton of brand new Tommy Bahama clothes at a fraction of the price you pay at Tommy Bahama.

Yes it is fast food. But for a fast food place you have to give it exra stars because of the great service you get which sets it above other fast food burger places.  When you order to dine it they will bring to your table a condiments tray and ask you if you need anything else. No other fast food place does that.

Great selection of different cuts of beef.  Decent selection of items from the midwest such as Door County pastries. Good dog treats also, pig ears, bones, etc. Surprisingly has a good selection of craft beer also.  Prices are higher than the chain grocery stores but the quality is there to justify it.  Love the beef sticks and sausages.  I'd avoid the typical deli items such as the coleslaw, potato salad, etc and get that at a regular grocery stuff. Great service also.  Use their coupons and save a mint.

A bit more pricier than some theaters but probably worth the money. Clean place with a clean and safe mall.  Nice seating. Don't really see the big attraction with the cine capri theater vs the other ones but if bigger screens are for you than knock yourself out.  Save some money and buy tickets at costco.

If you are in the mood for a fast fresh prepared as you order burger this is the place to go.  I recomend doing a google seach and looking at their 'secret' menu that list multiple different options and variations ontheir food.  I am a huge fan of the mustard grilled cheeseburger.  Fries are delish.  This isn't gourmet but they dont pretend to be.  The decor is 50-60'2 style throwback drive in.

Great for the price if you want to see movies that are soon to go on tv soon.  My main beef is that the walls are thin.  If you sit near a side or near the back wall of the theater you can hear what is going on on the other side of the wall which is distracting from the movie you are watching.  Good picture in the theater, just needs updated soundproofing.

They remodeled the theaters recently so it is only like stepping back in time to the 80's and not the 60's comfort wise but the movies are all digital now so the picture and sound is good and for $3 ($2 on Tuesdays) it is a great deal.  I really wish they could step it up a bit and offer the popcorn flavorings like Harkins does but I guess they are budget for a reason, no frills just value.

Great mexican food, located in a crappy little strip mall but the food makes up for the location.  Nice pleasent atmoshere. Can be crowded but a good sign is that they are expanding their hours.  The Tortas are great, filling and reasonably priced.  The chocolate flan is sinfully delicious.  They have nice marqaritas and crappy beer to wash the food down.

The place has grown up and gotten better over the last year or so.  Food wise it is top notch with tasty food choices including a bit of healthy choices.  The beers are usually pretty darn good also and they have some nice beer and food pairing suggestions.  The patio is small but pretty nice also.  Service is generally pretty good too. Good for lunchtime also.

If you don't mind the price it is a great place to go wild in. You can create your burgers, shakes, soda, etc anyway you want.  I loved being able to make a chocolate/root beer malt. The burgers come in multiple sizes. Service was good. If it wasn't so expensive I would go more often. Decor was 1950's soda fountain style.

One of the top breakfast joints in the city. My only knock from 5 stars to 4 is the wait and lack of adequete seating while you wait. The food itself is awesome and the wait staff are always friendly and efficent. Love the iced coffee.

If you aren't easy big greasy cheeseburgers, cold beer and hot waitresses who really turn on the charm then stay away from this place.  It isn't for those with weak stomaches and narrow minded chain driven people.  A little bit pricey but well worth it.

Yes, it is in a strip mall. Don't let that fool you. This is some downright good food with affordable prices.  Even though service was very attentive the waitress apoligized for taking so long. She must have high standards because like I said service was fast and attentive.  The chef came out and asked every table how their meal was and chatted with everyone a little bit.  The food has a French flair and to it and the chef is from Paris.

Huge selection of wine, booze and beer along with other bar/party type items. Snack food is really overpriced. My biggest complaint about this place is the lack of good craft beer that is kept cold. They have a big selection but 98% of it sits on a warm store shelf where it can go bad fast.  For my money I'd rather shop for beer at AJ's, Sun Devil, Tops or Papago but for wine and booze Bevmo is more than adequete.Prices can also be surprisngsly higher than their competitors.

The gelato is top notch. Really great flavors. Maybe I just had bad luck with the server but she didn't know how to make a malt, she even said that she thought a malt and a shake were the same thing and I had to tell her how to make it, and to top it off she used way too much milk, not enough gelato and so it was more like a chocolate milk than it was a malt.

Nice Arcadia area restaurant.  Pretty industrial look to the place, valet parking.  Meatball appetizers were very good and the pasta bolognaise was great as well.  Good selection of mixed drinks, wine and beer.  Very nice waitress and very attentive.  We'll be back.

Delicious ice cream with fantastic wonderful and fresh flavor ideas.  Got to say, wasn't a fan of the blue cheese but aI'm not going to knock them for that because it was creative. The basil lime was to die for.  Typical ice cream shop atmoshere, nothing fancy, just good times.

They have a number of interesting flavors and do a great job of being unique.  About my only complaint is the price, I know it is in Scottsdale but it is still just ice cream after all.  I am a huge fan of the jamesons irish creame and the salted caramel.  Available at Whole Foods also but a visit to the place is worthwhile for their unique flavors.

Went there for dinner last night at around 6:00. The place was packed. They were out of chicken so no chicken items and they were out of diet coke. I can understand a restaurant running out of an item that they have to prepare in advance but to run out of diet coke shows bad management in ordering, Food wise ordered the pasta but asked for no cheese as trying to do a lactose free thing, well guess what? Yes, They added cheese. When the pasta did arrive guess what again? It was cold? WTF. Can't believe the bad experience we had.

I was really looking forward to eating here.  Tucked away in a strip mall behind a Denny's. Nice patio area facing a parking lot.  The choices for the burgers were really good. The sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was good. Our burgers were both overcooked. The most dissapointing thing though was that the bun was nothing more than a store bought hamburger but. Sorry, but if you are spending $15 on a burger at least make it a good bun.

It is a drive to get to but the food is worth the drive.  Very nice decor and attentive staff. Prices were not unreasonable but could have been a tad less for better value. Lots of pasta choices and plentiful servings, I like a place that offers two kinds of garlic bread, with or without cheese. I was disappointed in the meatballs, definently have had better and at $2.50 a meatball they were not worth the money. Overall a good place to go if you are heading down towards Queen Creek.

Yelpers beware.  Unless you are into loud awful music and bad beer this is not a good spot to go to. In a remote part of north Phoenix we stopped in on our way back to civilazation after visiting Flagstaff.  I ordered the wit and thought it was simply disgusting. My girlfriend ordered the Red Ale and it was almost just as bad.  Paid for our beers and left them almost full and headed to Mellow Mushroom instead to get the bad taste out of our mouths.

Saw this on Diners and Dives so decided to check it out.  Certainly a low rent place. Come here for the food and not the atmosphere.  A great place if you like grease or huge portions. Dont even come here looking for anything vegetarian, it doesn't exist.  A big selection of flavors of milk shakes which go down real easy with all the grease coating your stomach and throat

Totally different type of Pizza than their Nello's cousins. More like a California Pizza Kitchen style. Also more upscale.  Funny area for such a little hidden gem.  Good pizzas-try the yukon gold.  Also the sandwiches and cheese/meat place is very good.  A micrf bag beer selection, some good imports and Four Peaks beers, full bar and a good wine list.

This place is a must go if you are some beer starved party animal ASU student but as an adult who is one step beyond the let's get blottoed for the sake of getting drunk this place isn't really worth visiting.  The beers really aren't that good compared to Four Peaks/Papago/Sun Up/San Tan, or any of the other brew pubs around.  Really wasn't that impressed with the food either.  The only reason I gave it an extra star than one because the service was good, of course there were only one other group in the place at the time.

Horray for hockey.  It's unfortunate that beyond the tv's to watch the games this place fails both on food and beer.  They share a kitchen with Over Easy so I know that the kitchen can produce great food however the menu is horrific.  Someone needs to step into this century. The beer menu is also pretty pathetic.  You would think that a place in North Scottsdale would realize that people will pay more for good beer and that there is more to beer than just Coors light. I give it two stars one for the tv's and one for the friendly waitress.

The same great food as their Phoenix location but it is just missing the same old school charm of the owner yelling at the cooks to get the food out fast.  It has a nice patio next to the ice rink. The main advantage of the Scottsdale location is the extended hours and larger seating capacity than their Phoenix place.

I've been here a couple of times, hopeing that they would get past their newly opened problems but alas they still have the same stupid willie wonka movie playing and are still serving lousy hot dogs. The beer is ok most of the time. The 'attitude' of the bartenders is what really turns me off though. Lighten up, so you hate your job. Don't take it out on the customer.

My check engine light had come in on my car. Firestone said it was going to cost about $300 to do a complete diagnostic on it.  A friend told me about Ron's.  Got it checked and the problem fixed for less than what the diagnostic would have cost me at Firestone.  Great service.

If you like old fashioned greasy burgers this place is for you.  Very reasonable prices. Old fashioned milk shakes for $2.99, burgers about $6.00 with extra fixins like grilled onions for .59 cents. Not fancy, just fast food good.

Great 24 hour coffee shop and bistro. One caveat-only order the baked goods in the morning, by the afternoon/evening they tend to be dried out. The coffee is good and the service is friendly. Unlike most coffee shops they have alcohol so it is a good brunch place. The beer selection is geared towards out of state beers and really not that exciting.  They also have sandwiches and after 5:00 P.M. a daily dinner special that for a coffee shop is usually pretty good. Casual coffee shop vibe inside and a dog friendly patio outside.

Finally a place that northern phoenicians can go to to get good beer.  Very much more like a pizza joint than a bar even though they have a wide variety of good beers, both local, microbrew and imports.  A little more like North Scottsdale prices than North Phoenix prices though which is funny since they are going to open one in North Scottsdale from what they told me. The pizzas were heavily crust oriented with a sweet crust, almost honeylike.Being the only real game in the area they will do good so if you like pizza and beer check them out.

Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.  Just get the food ala carte, the beans and rice portions with a combo are small and aren't that great.  Not a very good selection of beers and the regular margarita is just so so.

Way off the strip and beaten path so it was pretty easy to get in.  Enormous portions. Perfect after a long night of partying.  Everything is big here including the desserts.  Food alll seemed fresh and delicious. Great Bloody Marys also.  Cheaper than a Vegas buffet and just as filling.

Saw this on Diner's and dives,  While it may appear to be a typical fast food place located in a gas station the food is so much better than the other 'to's' places, like poliburto'a, filibrto's, losbeto's,etc.  Service is generally fast, the al astor is a favorite of mine as are the carne asada taco's.  They even deliver to the surrounding area.

Hard to like or dislike this place.  The dessert (flan) and beverages (horchata) were outstanding, the rest of the meal below average. Taco's were small street size taco's and the carne asada burrito was filled with a lot of beans. Service was good and the place was very clean.

Yay, a place with real authentic home cooked food. It's a small mom and pop place where everything is made from scratch. The homemade apple cider sweetener for the tea is to die for. I just wish they were open in the evening for dinner. Great for breakfast and lunch though.  They serve up soups, salads, sandwiches and have daily specials.

The place is located in one of Arizonas many fine strip malls but dont hold that against it.  It is primarily a little neighborhood sports bar with big screens that is narrow, dark and noisy inside which dings it one star however the food is what I am going to talk about. The burgers are extremely well made albeit a little bit too large to really wrap your hands around.  Lots of interesting upscale fix-ings.  They did a great job of preparing our burgers to order, the rare was perfectly rare and he medium well was medium well.  The side dishes are upscale for a bar but fit in well for this camelback/arcadia area location, they were o.k. but not as well done as the burgers.

I was really looking forward to getting some upscale food at a real gastro pub here in Phoenix but alas was sadly disappointed.  This place gives the word Gastro Pub a bad name.  The food was slightly overpriced for bar food, which it essentially was. The wife had the salmon that was overcooked. I opted for a burger and would have been just as happy going to in n out down the street.  They did have a large tap list, about 30 beers on tap but half of them were garbage beers, they were really trying to push PBR when we were there. C'mon- PBR in what is supposed to be an upscale pub!!! Whomever owns this place needs to get a clue.

A nice place to take a date or the wife for a little romance. Women just melt for fondue you know.  French and Swiss cuisine. They place has nice small appetizers and boatloads of crepes either for dinner or dessert.  My only knock is the price. You know that there really isn't anything to making a crepe or fondue but places like this jack up the price just because it is French. C'mon people, it is basically either just an egg or cheese.  I would also like to chime in on Denise's review. C'mon knocking a French place because they have foie gras is stupid. You might as well write a bad review about every French restaurant on the planet.

Went here for dinner, there were only about 6 other people in there on a Monday night. Even with 2 servers for 6 people the service was absolutely horrible. We almost walked out after not getting service for about 10 minutes.  The food itself is decent BBQ. Not great but entirely edible.  I enjoyed the blue cheese cole slaw.  When my dinner arrived the waiter said that they gave me the wrong type of sausage, they left the one they gave me and followed it with what I ordered later which was nice.  The ribs come dry, not wet but they will make them that way for you if you want.  With a crowd like this I don't know how much longer they can stay open.

Even if the decor is from Ikea the food is anything but Ikea. Really eclectic mix of scandavian, polish and canadian food. Desserts are wonderful. Huge portions and dirt cheap prices. Shhh, don't tell them they can easily charge more. If they were in a real sit down restaurant and not a strip mall fast food locale they could charge twice as much and still be considered cheap.  All food is handmade and should remind you of what Grandma used to make for you from the old country.

Old school diner with old school friendly service.  Great biscuits and sausage gravy with a ton of sausage in the gravy, the corned beef hash is mostly corned beef-not potatoes as other people corned beef hash is.  As I said, super friendly staff with great service. Military discount also.

I am sold on this place.  The yogurt flavors are simply outstanding. Taste fresh and not artificial. They have a large selection of toppings, since it is sold by weight and not exactly cheap I usually lean towards the lighter toppings such as the toasted coconut.  Bonus points for the sample cups.

Even though I gave this 4 stars I was tempted to give it just 3 but are giving them the benefit of the doubt having eaten there a few times. The place is remarkably clean. The food is usually very good although a few dishes, especially the desserts and Mongolian BBQ could be improved upon. I have to give them credit though for also offering steaks even though I rarely get them. On our last visit the food was as good as previous visits but will visit it again to see if it goes back to the level it ws, if not the star rating will go down.

Old town Scottsdale for sure. Old Town prices on food, small portions but tasty. Prices on beers were fair for Old Town but nothing local and nothing too exciting beer wise, as is typical with Old Town the featured beverages are overpriced mixed drinks with fancy names-best to avoid them.  Food as I said had small portions but had an eclectic menu with a lot of variety and was prepared well.

This is a roadtrip type of place for sure.  Met the owners at a different place and they seemed nice so decided to check it out. Pretty good selection of beer, not as good as taste of tops or papago but better than 98% of the other bars out there.  Didn't try the food, just there for beer. Service was so so.  Wish the owners had been there and if they are when you visit give them a shout.

I think the owner came from Luke's originally.  Much of the same menu except it is a 1 person operation and can be slow at times.  Very good food, fries not as good as Lukes and the sandwhiches were smaller than Lukes however they were less expensive so fair value.  Same RC cola as Lukes.

This is a working brewery, not a brew pub. There is food available from a food truck occasionally.  The choice of beers is limited to just a couple of beers none of which are really exciting for a craft beer lover. Their beers are more entry level type beers for craft beer newbies so if Blue Moon is your idea of craft beer you'll like this place but if your idea of craft beer is Four Peaks Hop Knot forget it. Prices are ultra reasonable but I look at it as you pay for what you get. Their beers and the place are clean without any off flavors.

Maybe my expectations were too high but I was really disappointed. Basically has the feel and vibe of just another chain restaurant along the lines of say a BJ's or TGI Fridays. I agree a lot with Les L review. They are trying to be a fake beer bar by having a lot of taps, sadly there really wasn't anything special on their 40 or so taps that you can't get at the grocery store. The food itself was pretty lifeless. Also had the feel and look of chain restaurant mass produced food. The service was ok and also atypical of a chain restaurant. Lifeless and no personality.

Located in a non descript strip mall and that alone will turn away a lot of people...for shame. Because inside you will find some tasty craft brews from Firestone, Papago, Four Peaks, Oak Creeek, San Tan, and O'Dells.  The burgers are the house specialty and will satisfy any burger lover. Get the one with the egg on top and you are in chloesterol heaven.  Nice pool tables and friendly bartenders in aq place that is trying to make craft beer work in a non craft beer environment.  PS Sweet potatoe tots are to die for.

Went in there tonight to catch the ASU game and to have some dinner. So disappointed about how this place now appears to be going downhill.  The service was atrocious.  After being there at least 10 minutes another waiter told my waiter that I hadn't been waited on. The guy appeared to be put out because he was enjoying his conversation with a friend at the bar.  I had a burger and it was cooked beyond well done.  Because the waiter never bothered to come back and check on me after my food was there I finally ended up eating it instead of sending it back since it was at least 10 minutes between visits to our table. Bad food and bad service is no way to stay in business.

Imagine a Hooters where the girls cut their outfits in half. That is about the only reason to go to this place. It's a decent sports bar for guys to hang out in but not for familys or with your wife. Lots of beers on tap, unfortunately they serve them at ice cold 29 degrees temperature which is ok for your bud light, coors light drinker but for craft beer it should be served at around 40 degrees. Hello McFly!!!  Food was typical bar food for the most part with a few modern choices. The meatloaf is more like just a hamburger patty than real meatloaf IMHO. The place specializes in breasts, and not chicken breasts.

Snottsdale version of a gas station.  How many places can you go and find 100 octane racing fuel, latte's, basic groceries and good old fashioned BBQ and get your car washed also?  Love the sauce bar for the BBQ.  While it certainly isn't your homespun old school type of any of the above mentioned business they do a good job at combining all of them under one roof.

Had to give Sol 5 stars simply because of the super friendly and helpful staff.  Food was good, had the street taco fight which consists of 6 tacos and an order of guac.  While I have had better Mexican food for cheaper it was still very nice, fresh and was all well made. Atmosphere was nice and pleasent except that they kept opening up a side door to do cleaning which let in a lot of unwanted cold air. Normally I would knock down a star except for the great staff.

Would love to give this place 5 stars but just cannot since to get 5 stars they would have to provide celery and carrots with their wing orders.  Other than that little thing everything here is great. 18 different flavors of wings.  The dry rub ATL are great as well as the citrus chipotle as my top two.  A unique item is kool aid for the kids. Decor is sparse but the food is great.

I may or may not give these guys a second chance. No draft beer was available when I was there because their draft system was broken.  The selection of draft beers looked o.k. nothing outstanding but their bottle selection sucked. If a place is calling itself a brewery at least try and have some real beer. The worst part though was the food... $6 for a fried bologna sandwich? Are you kidding me? Cute names on the food but poor execution.

Very unusual place. Most bars and nightclubs don't have a pool. Honestly I don't see this place surviving long term given its location.  Large menu. Good Happy Hour prices on food and drinks.  Food was just average.  Hot waitresses, typical for Scottsdale.  Almost more like hanging out at a resort pool than a bar/restaurant.

Love the decor changes the new owners made. A vast improvement of chuy's.  Food was very good. Delicious chips and salsa.  Service was a little bit spotty. Slow on the iced tea and water refills.  The kitchen did make sure to bring out some more albondigas soup to my wife which was nice, when they delivered it to the table they said they would because hers was lacking some meatballs, they're call not ours so it was good to see them paying attention to that level of detail.

So disappointed. The last time when it was pretty new it was good. This visit was horrible.  Carne Asada was overcooked and looked disgusting. The waiters seem uninterested in helping and only made the occasional pass by.  The place was deserted. Management needs to get their act together and bring this place back to life.

The place only rates one star but gave them a second star just because they have some other beers available besides their own terrible ones that don't taste like toefungus. Food was average at best. as was the service.  One would have hoped a repackeaged Electric Dave's would improve itself but alas it hasn't.  Plenty of other options on Mill Ave or Four Peaks that are so much better.  Just a matter of time before this place closes it doors.

Another typical Scottsdale overhyped eatery.  Food wasn't as good as these rave reviews are making it out to be.  Food was overcooked, bacon was burnt, and buns were kind of lame. Portions were somewhat on the small side although for Scottsdale the pricing was inexpensive by Scottsdale standards.  Really strange beer pricing.  German imports and American microbrews were reasonably priced but the Belgian imports were marked up like they were liquid gold, twice what you would pay for the same beer at OHSO, Delux or Papago.  I was there on opening day so I'll leave my comments about service for another review after they have time to settle in.  Gave it another chance and service still hasn't improved.  Had to knock it down.

Went here for their Octoberfest celebration on a nice cool night and sat on the patio.  Once again was extremely disapointed in the service and the food.  Ordered the schnitzel and it came out say we say extremely well done.  My wife ordered a pretzel as an appetizer and it never arrived.  She was disapointed in the size of her sausage which was mostly bread and had to order another item to fill her up.  Use caution if ordering a bottled beer, crazy high prices on anything Belgian. Cheaper and better options abound around town.

Too bad Yelp won't allow you to give out 10 stars.  Located in a non descript strip mall like just about everything else in Phoenix.  This place has it together. Great food, great service, friendly people. If I had to complain about anything it is that one day I can imagine that one day the place will be too small and they'll be a wait but for now it is still somewhat a hidden gem.

Very spacious and a very attentive wait staff (probably because there were only 4 tables seated at the time so with 2 managers, a few hostesses and multiple busboys and waitresses the service should be good).  Food was pretty good. The spicy pickle was excellent as were the sidedishes. The entrees and dessert were a little of a let down. Another negative is that while they do have some decent local beers available with their menu they could do a much better job at having a larger beer selection and they should include some Belgian beers like a wit or triple to go with the seafood.  Expect to spend at least $60 per person as everything is ala carte.

There is nothing exciting about a stale corporate version of Taste of Tops. They have the same beers and are much more expensive than Taste of Tops. Guess the rent on Mill Ave is a lot more than on University a couple of blocks away.  Loud and horrendously bad music doesn't help either.  No food but you can call the local restaurants for delivery, but this is a problem because when the delivery people get there they have no idea on who ordered the food and you can't hear your phone ring so the delivery people just wander around aimlessly.. Also you have Mill Ave parking issues to deal with. They do have a lot of beers to choose from but so does Tops down the street.  My advice, save your wallet and your ears and go to Tops down the street instead.

When we got there the place was crowded so we decided to go out on the patio. Alright, who spends a lot of money on a patio and doesn't install lights?  Service was super slow outside and because we couldn't read the menus we made our way back inside and eventually got a table. Problem #2. The noise. Really bad acoustics.  We had to scream at the server just to get our order in and then when it eventually arrived it was wrong.  I wish new places opening up would have better training programs for their staff.  It appeared that they only had one computer working also which slowed things down.  The menu looked good and the variety of beer on tap was impressive.  I'll go back again in a few months to see if they have worked out their solvable problems. I'm sure the noise problem will solve itself if people stop going if they don't fix the other problems.

OK I gave this place the benefit of the doubt by visiting a second time but when we visited for lunch they still continue to have major issues with the place. Our food order was once again messed up as it was the previous time we visited. The server also knew little to nothing about the beers they had on tap.  I think it is bizarre that when four people order food at the same time that the kitchen cannot expedite everything so that everyone gets served at the same time.

OMG-Bring back the regular Sweet Tomatoes.  The place is a disaster.  You walk in and are confronted by chalkboard menu that is overwhelming and a hostess who has to explain everything to you.  They still have a do it yourself salad bar that is a scaled down and not for the better version of the old Sweet Tomatoes, except you have a server who doles out the watered down salad dressing to you in individual paper cups. You end up paying more and getting less than the original concept.  They also have taken away their great strawberry lemonade. Even though you are with your family you are all given your own order cards---dumb.  Suffice it to say we will never go back to a Field Kitchen and will just have to drive further to a original Sweet Tomatoes.  Decor was only slightly modified from the old place and still has the gross original sweet tomatoes carpet.

Horrible customer service.  My satellite is out and they can't come out for 5 days to look at it and they only have 8-12 available so I'll have to miss work. Next evening or weekend available isn't available for 12 days. Ridiculous.

Don't come here looking for the great Four Peaks food.  This is a pure brewery with a beer bar.  Waitresses were simply transplanted from the original brewpub so they know their beers.  Nice open space without the college kid atmosphere and unlike 8th Street they have plenty of parking. A great place for a business meeting over a beer..

Still doing good and wanted to update my review to say they are doing a great job at bringing in really good food trucks.  Lacks thge atmosphere of the 8th Street brewery location but has good beer, is quiet and climate controlled year round.

Two stars for a great patio, zero stars for everything else.  Service was horrendous. Our server couldn't get one order straight and when the bills came it was apparent why, every bill in our group was wrong.  We were all laughing about it. One guy tried the tabbedout thing they have and his orders were messed up also.  Food wasn't very tasty either, the wings were overcooked, the salads were mushy. The beer list was large but all mostly entry level microbrew beers, with so many taps put a couple of out of the box beers on please.

Typical corporate hooters wannabe knockoff. While the food is marginally better than Hooters the problem here is the beer. They seem to be stuck in the 70's with their idea that to be good beer must be served below freezing temperature. They are actually proud that they serve their beer at 28 degrees.  Wake up management and yes serve your Bud and Coors at those temperatures but welcome to the modern era, craft beer should be served in the low 40's to be able to taste the flavor and get the right aroma out of the beer. Average service from scantilly clad girls who are looking for MRS degrees from hipster wannabes.

Food and cocktails were spectacular but the beers were all so pedestrian, even with a nice selection of craft beers they are all mostly run of the mill everyday beers like SunBru or Stella Artrois. It is a shame that they don't put the same effort into the beer menu as they do the food or drink menu.  Potato and leek pizza was really good.

This was a tough review.  They advertise Mexico City cuisine, to me it was pretty much Sonoran. The food was very tasty, I had a torta where the bread was dipped in a guarillo sauce. The problem with it was that it was all bread with very little filling, but I still loved the flavors.  The place is pretty big with not much crowd. I hope they make it. They would probably have been better off in a smaller establishment.

To start off with the building is ultra cool being in an old church with the stained glass windows still intact and all.  They have an extensive tequila list and also feature local craft brews from Cartel, Papago, Four Peaks, etc.  The portions of guacamole were large enough for a group of 4.  Very interesting mix of tacos to choose from from lamb with blue cheese to peking duck. Prices were fair and service was excellent. Could turn into a new regular place for us.

Would give it 5 stars for the food, service and ambience but have to knock it down a star because of the long wait times to get in.  C'mon please take reservations and make everyones life easier.  The hash with green chilies in it is to die for.  They also make a killer bloddy mary. I understand they are getting ready to open a place in Tempe. I can only imagine what the wait time will be like there.  They also carry a few beers but the choices don't make sense. I'm sorry but who wants to drink a big IPA for breakfast, they'd be better off selling San Tan's Mr. Pineapple, Papago's Orange Blossom or Sonoran's Vanilla.

Not a fan of their ordering system, come in order at a counter then sit down for delivery. Would have much preferred to sit down and order like at a normal restaurant.  Burgers were extremely tasty as was the gourmet style milkshakes.  Sodas are not your typical coke/pepsi products but vanilla cream, etc.  Has a small bar with a small selection of microbrewed beer but nothing really to write home about.  Dog friendly patio.

Nice little chocolate, waffle and ice cream shop in old town Scottsdale.  Prices are high, as you would expect for the location and for the fact that they import the waffles and chocolates from Belgium.  You can save money if you buy the chocolates by the box and not individually, example each chocolate is $2.50 a piece, but it is $25 for a 12 chocolate box.  The waffles are good, like the chocolates they are pricey also at $3.50 each just for plain, double that when you add the toppings however the salted caramel topping is to die for. Lots of variety on the chocolates and the waffle toppings.  Haven't tried the ice cream yet but we'll be back for sure to check it out after we get our next bonus checks.

The place is brand new so I will have to come back to see if there are signs of improvement. The menu is very ecclectic, with everything from your standard bar nachos, burgers to mussels and prime rib. Some of the food seemed fairly priced while others seemed a little high, burgers for example were pretty much all over $10   The food was just ok, nothing special but they are new so kind of giving them the benefit of the doubt but for the prices they will need to step it up a notch.  The decor is spartan but clean, not sure what the theme is that they are trying to accomplish, layout looks much more like a casual diner than a bar or upscale restaurant.  Now my big beef.  If you are going to call yourself House of Brews the focus should be on the beer, which it clearly is not. Some local distributors sold them a bill of goods.  They have a pretty decent size beer list but the bad thing is they are wasting a number of taps on beers that tastes alike, Victoria, Budweiser and Coors Light, Stella Artrois and Redhook? Come on now, you only need one bland beer, and 2 ciders? Really., Give the people of Gibert some credit. Only one SanTan beer on but 4 Four Peaks beers, that's not fair. All the other beers were also just very pedestrian. It wouldn't take much like having 1 beer knowledgeable person on staff to revamp that list and make the beer stand out instead of just becoming known for a place that buys the cheapest beer from the distributors that they can.  When I go back instead of ordering an everyday meaningless beer I'll take a water or a coke unless they change it up.  I'm sure people in Gilbert want to have a place to go for beer that is on par with places in nearby Chandler, Tempe and Scottsdale. So far this isn't it.

After seeing this place in the Yelp top 100 we had to check it out.  I find it hard to believe it made the top 1-- but whatever.  The dogs were good but the owner was constantly yelling at his wife/girlfriend who was taking orders.  Place is in a strip mall.  Most of the food is a big mess, a tasty mess but a mess nonetheless.

Great food truck,  it's really a shame that the actual bar that owns the truck diesn't have the same quality food. Like a lot of food trucks it is a little pricey but it is pretty good. My only complaint is that there wasn't enough gravy with the fried chicken.

A new brewery in the same spot that housed the former Rio Salado Brewing Company in an industrial area in south Tempe. This review is for the tasting room only as they don't have any of their own beers made yet. The decor is homey, more like hanging out in your living room than a brewery tasting room. A couple of tv's and a nice little bar area with 20 taps.  They have 2 wines on tap as well as a root beer and a cider so there is a little bit for the whole family. No food but they have food trucks similar to what Phoenix Ale is doing. The brewery itself looks really nice and I am looking forward to having some of their beers in the future. They have some of the same owners as Papago Brewing and will be making Papago beers on site also as well as their own. Looking forward to good things from people who "get" what craft beer is all about.

Certainly not the best new brewery in the world.  Four Peaks easily in my opinion is the best local place for beer and food.  Long wait for a table and then an equally long wait for service.  Take a lesson from Four Peaks and learn how to handle crowds.  The beers-yes they are different but just because they are different doesn't mean that they are all good.  I liked the IPA but the berliner weiss was disgusting. A real drain pour.  Food when it finally did arrive was extremely salty.  Giving it two stars because I did like the IPA.

Where to start. A. Slow service. B. Everything we ordered was a salt bomb. C. Their beers tasted like butter bombs. D. How can you mess up BBQ and beers so bad?  These guys have found a way.  E. The place was clean-give it one star for that.  They need to do a clean out of the kitchen staff-wait staff and brewers before we'll be back since the problems all seemed to generate from the people working there who either don't care about the quality of what they are serving or how they serve it.

Sadly My wife forced me to go back to this place to meet with some friends of hers.  Nothing has improved since our last horrible visit and if I could give it zero stars I would. Place was now dirty unlike the last time. It is clear the staff could care less about this place.  Food was still overly salty and covering it up with BBQ sauce doesn't work and the beers were still horrible including their mandarin wheat which is clearly trying to be a rip off of the delicious tasting Papago Orange Blossom. Their IPA tasted like dirty soap water which is surprising since there is apparently no soap around to clean tables off with.

Located up in North Scottsdale, it holds it own with other great breakfast places in the valley.  I loved the red velvet waffle. It's dessert and breakfast all rolled into one.    They have a omelette where you can add everything including the breakfast sink for one price.  Service was exceptional from the friendly hostess to the waiter.

One star for atmosphere but zero stars for the beer, food and the service.  Beer is simply bad homebrew, not quality craft beer. Food was greasy and you can tell that they mostly use preprepared food with very little made fresh on site.  How hard is it to mess up tater tots that are prepackaged? This place found a way. Grease pit galore.  The server seemed more interested in chatting with her coworkers than in actually working.  San Tan located a couple of blocks away is so much better.

Probably the worst Chinese food I have ever had.  Ordered the 2 item combo, Sesame Chicken and Beef with Onions and Peppers. Both were so overcooked it was inedible. The meats were cooked until they were both crispy as in burnt.  What was truly amazing was that the onions weren't cooked at all so it was like eating burnt meat with a raw onion. Never again but even at a shopping mall food court one must expect better.

Hard to rate this one. The bacon board was excellent except but the entrees weren't so good. Why use a smoker if you are going to cover the meat in bbq sauce that tastes like ketchup?  Drinks were good and they had a good selection of craft brews from Four Peaks, SanTan, Papago and others. Our server was excellent and got one of our entrees comped when it was messed up. Could have been 3 stars because of the poor bbq sauce but the service made it 4 stars.

Probably the worst tasting beer in Arizona.  Bad Water is an appropriate name for this place since their beer is obviously brewed with bad water.  The guest beers are just mediocre probably because any really good beer would shine the light on how bad their beer is.   Located in Old Town Scottsdale so instead of going to this place spend your money going to any of the dozens of nearby places that have good beer and food. They have a number of charcuterie boards to eat, all overpriced.

This was a tough review, with the name Taphouse you would expect beers to play a huge part of this business and they do but way too many mediocre offerings such as Stella, Kona and Widmer but a number of good local favorites such as SanTan, Papago and Four Peaks help make up for it.  Biggest gripe was with the prices, yes it is Scottsdale but the beer costs them the same as other places and $7 a pint is too much to charge for where others charge $5 or $6 for the same beer.  Food prices also high by about 25% over what I would consider a fair price but we were celebrating so what the heck The Coconut Joe braised short ribs were pretty damn good and the service was good. Wish this place had better prices so we could go back more often.

Get there early because when they run out they are done for the day.  Brisket was good as well as the turkey.  Real Texas style BBQ.  Sauces on the table are good but not really needed.  Sides were plentiful. We probably had a 25 minute wait on Saturday which wasnt too bad.

Made a late afternoon stop today and thought I was too late because there was no line. Much to my delight they still had ribs, brisket and turkey left.  Super friendly service.  Also ordered a smoked pecan pie that was fantastic, not a lot of smoke flavor but utterly delicious.

Read about this place and decided to check it out.  It lives up to the hype, doughnuts come out fresh with the toppings you want. The owner is very nice and tries to greet everyone.  My only complaint is just the lack of the doughnut itself in variety as only one kind is made. I would have loved to have had a devils food doughnut. The place is kept spotless.

Typical Phoenix strip mall location.  Have to love it when a plan comes together-NOT. I had read that this place was going to offer Czech style lagers and Czech cuisine, sorry but milk stouts and candy cream ales are not Czech and neither are grilled cheese sandwiches.  The beer really is just like typical homebrew and is certainly not up to commercial standards. Come here with your expectations set low and you'll be ok but dont expect a real brewpub.

This place has so much potential but falls so short on everything. The patio will be sure to rock in the winter but the place is a deserted wasteland right now in the summer.  Stay away from anything with cheese sauce such as the cheese fondue. The stuff is literally worse than melted velveeta.  At happy hour they have $2.00 off apps. Not a very good happy hour.  It should have warned us not to order dinner but we did anyway. Major disappointment again.  They do have a lot of craft beer taps but sadly the selection is very pedestrian. they did have some good local brews like Four Peaks Hop Knot, Papago Orange Blossom and Huss Scottsdale Blonde but very little to really thrill a craft beer person seeking something more than mainstream offerings. Only had two IPAs on out of all the taps. So sad.

After a airport drop off I decided to visit this place for breakfast.  Friendly staff and incredible donuts.  Some were on the pricey side ($3.00) for a donut but trust me they were worth it. Had the Maple Bacon and Chipotle Lemon.  It was too early for chicken but you could see the chicken out getting prepped for lunch and looked incredible.  They also have a couple of beers on tap but I didn't ask what they were.

Same great food as their other location.  Wasn't happy that there was no wait however it was a Friday with ASU on summer break.  I would imagine I wont be going back to this location when school is in seesion.  Also parking is more difficult here. The location at the Town and Country has plenty of free parking.

First Caveat, this review was written the second day the place was open so I am hopeful it will improve.  The place is big and airy with a nice bar and patio. Be warned-the beer selection is pretty pathetic and would be better if they added some locally made craft beers instead of crap like Blue Moon and Dos Equis.  That said the service was horrible.  The waitress was completely out of her element.  We waited for about 5 minutes or so before we were asked if we wanted anything to drink. Over 10 minutes went by before our coffee and water showed up (Water spots on the glassware). Then we had to ask for menus.  Finally our order was taken.  The food came out in a semi reasonable time but the waffle was cold and the $2.99 side of jalapeno coleslaw was incredibly small for the price. We actually should have received two waffles because the waffle that came was with the meal and I had ordered the coffee and waffle special as well. There was a second waitress who seemed to have her act together, in fact another table next to us that came in 15-20 minutes after us got served by her and had their food before we did and paid before we did. Oh and that waitress took the time to refill my coffee, something our waitress didnt do once. Oh-the bill was messed up also and they had problems with their credit card machine being out of paper.  The bathroom was also dirty and wasn't cleaned from the night before as we were there right when the place opened. We were there just over an hour which is twice as long as it should have taken.  Was a calamity of errors but errors that proper training of the staff or a good restaurant manager could fix.

This place is trying to be a craft beer focused place but in reality it is much more of a wine place.  The food and beer are way overpriced, even for Scottsdale. If you like "gourmet" style pizzas you might like it but if you are a traditional type pizza person forget it. The decor is spartan, the place looks like an old house that was converted into a restaurant. The rest rooms are located in a separate building outside.  The bill for two people was over $50 and we still left hungry.   The pizza at Fate Brewing is cheaper and better.  LOL- I couldn't believe the place is 5 stars on Yelp until I looked at most of the 5 star reviews. Funny how so many of the people who gave it 5 stars have only reviewed one place-this place. Beware of fake reviews.

So very different than the old Frahers on Scottsdale Rd that you wouldn't know that they moved because it is so very different.  Much more like a midwestern bbq restaurant than a dark dive bar as it was.  The menu was small but everything we ordered was good.  The chicken wings were the bomb.  The smoker is outside the front patio.  They have a small bar area but it isn't the kind of place you'd want to hang out in but the beverages are more just to go along with the meal.  Had a very small selection of craft beer and well drinks.  Service was good and friendly.

Very delicious food. 40 minute wait though.  Since it's only been open a short time hopefully the fad will fade away and have more reasonable wait times,  We ordered the spicy and crisp chicken.  Could certainly have been more spicy but it was tasty.  Prices are on the high end for Asian food.

Service, service, service. It is the star here. Of course I expect that to change over time, no business is going to survive with 4 people working outside the drive thru or 2 people handing out menus to people as they walk in. Food wise for Chicago style dogs, italian beef, etc I would rather have locally owned Luke's or Taylor Street with one exception, the chocolate cake shake is awesome but as I said the other food is just average, nothing outstanding.

Have to love a place that makes its own flour tortillas from scratch.  The place is somewhat hard to find tucked in a mall.  My only complaint about the chili verde burrito is that while it was stuffed full of pork I didn't see even one green chili in the burrito.  It was still tasty but I just expected a little more.  One suggestion would be to beef up their soda offerings or maybe include some authentic Mexican beverages.

Great little place in Old Town Scottsdale.  They are fairly new, only open 3 months but are delivering some great tasting meat pies and desserts.  Limited soda selection but they are in the process of opening a bar so by the fall they should have more beverage coices.  I thought the sausage roll was a little on the salty side but it still tasted great.  Not exactly a great vibe right now as a sit down place but great food to go.
