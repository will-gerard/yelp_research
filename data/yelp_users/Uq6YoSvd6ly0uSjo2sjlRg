I hate this place so much! The smell of burnt fry oil consumes you when you arrive. Then we sat at the bar which smelled even worse and tiny fruit fly's everywhere. If you are reading this and you are the health inspector, please drop in and give this place a much needed wrist slap.

Best meal I've had here in the valley! Tuna tartar, filet, gnocchi, peas, carrot cake.... All perfect!

Took me as a walk in customer, in and out in about an hour and a half from start to finish for an easy little piece I had done. Great service, very clean, very professional!

Best spot for hard to find local AZ brew!!!  They also have a very cool Nano brew setup that every homebrewer would kill to have!  Good food, good atmosphere, and enough bikes on the patio to start your own hipster bicycle gang.

Wasn't expecting a great breakfast, but I got one! 1 and a 1/2 actually because I ate the rest of wifey's as well.  The food is much better quality than you would think based on appearances. Its a little dive like but that's where the gems are usually hidden!  We will be back, soon!!!

Just found my new favorite hang out. This place has it all, good service, great beer selection, TVs all over the place, killer food menu, even the house music is on point. We will be visiting this place regularly.
