I have been to many Waffle Houses before, but this one is gross. I had to get up and leave due to general lack of cleanliness. We sat down at a "just cleaned" table which still had a big smudge of syrup or jam on it, then we grabbed our menus which also had finger-smudged gunk all over them. I ordered an ice tea and the aftertaste of it was gross... it had been over-brewed. It was incredibly cold in there as well, which was totally unnecessary considering the temperature outside was in the 70's. Yet they had the AC on full blast and I was uncomfortably chilly. The final straw for me was when I saw a small group of flies buzzing around next to the window near my table... at first I didn't think anything of it; I thought they were outside the window. But then I noticed they were all actually inside, and if I can see that many flies right at my table, there must be quite a few roaming freely inside the restaurant. Overall lack of cleanliness made us get up and leave. I shall not come back to this particular Waffle House.

This place is awesome! The management at the front office are all really nice people. The greenery and scenery all over this apartment complex is so nice. There are little waterfalls and a little stream, lots of big old trees and the pool area is really pretty. Also the floorplans inside of these apartments are really nice, some of the best we've seen around here and we looked at probably 10 other places in our search to find an apartment. This place is also located right next to a park and a dog park, so just walking around here and taking the pups for a walk is really serene.

I have eaten here twice (hoping my first experience was just a bad fluke... but sadly it wasn't). The service at this place is HORRIBLE. My first visit, I told the waiter that this was my first time and he said "that's nice" and just walked away. It took forever to get drink refills, salsa for our chips, etc. The waiter just didn't care and treated us like we were inconveniencing his otherwise very lazy day (FYI, we were one of 3 tables in the entire place... it was pretty dead in there). The sad part is the food was actually pretty good, so we decided to give it another shot. The next time we went, the service level was just as bad even though we had a different server (a waitress this time). Asking for extra water, salsa, etc. seemed like such a chore for her... and she'd disappear into the kitchen for long periods of time, then come back with one little thing for one of the 3-4 tables of people (again, pretty dead in there) and would then disappear again... it really seemed like she was avoiding the customers. For such a small, dead place... you would think they would be trying to WOW their customers to drum up some new business, but no... they don't want you here. Customers are just a nuisance to them.

Sun Asian Kitchen is a great restaurant. The place is always clean, the staff is super friendly and attentive, the food is damn good and happy hour is 3-7pm every day with some great specials for sushi, appetizers and drinks. I am a regular here and I can't praise them enough. I have never had a bad experience here. If this is your first time, I'd recommend their spicy tuna rolls... delicious! ^_^

I wish this didn't sound so harsh, but to be honest... the smell that we experienced when we walked into this restaurant was just overpoweringly foul. It smelled like a sweaty, dirty clothes hamper combined with a pungent not-so-fresh meat smell. We had been excited to come try this place, but we were out of there within 2 minutes. It was a memorably bad experience.

There is a masseuse that works here named Kevin Pittman. He is F A N T A S T I C! I just got home from my massage and it was the best I think I have ever had anywhere. He's built like a truck and he's super personable, friendly, social and very intelligent too. I normally avoid talking during massages because I dislike random small talk, but Kevin was very genuine and fun to talk to. He worked out my back incredibly well (it had been hurting me all day) and I feel so much better now. I am DEFINITELY coming back here.   Awesome Groupon find :-)

Went to Cadillac Ranch for the first time last night with a big group of friends (about 12 of us) for a birthday get-together. We got there around 8pm and started ordering drinks and food. The waitress was attentive, so that's a plus, but the food and drinks were not very good and they were very overpriced.   I ordered the nachos... and what do they bring me? A plate of small tostadas! WTF?! Also, they burnt the chicken they put on top of these tostadas. Every bite was 50/50 between dry bland food and gross burnt flavor. So then I ordered chicken strips and fries. While the fries were pretty good, the chicken was very bland and kind of chewy.   Now for the drinks... the birthday girl had quite a few and I tried a bit of each. Most of them were really tart and honestly hard to drink. I had the big blue punch-bowl drink with the Red Bull in it... and while it was a decent (3-star) drink, there's no way in hell it's worth $14.   Up until 10pm, this place is a solid 2 stars. However, after 10pm they brought out a terrible DJ and cranked the music up so loud we couldn't hear each other anymore. The music was terrible, way too loud, and it totally ruined the conversation we were all having. Around this time about half of our group left. The only reason we stayed is because a few people were still on their way, so we tried to make the best of it and we stayed until 11:30pm.  The comments from just about everyone in our 12 person group were... "Wow, this place isn't very good, is it?" or "Where did our waitress go? After 10pm they simply abandoned us over here, didn't they?"  All in all, great company at our table... but this place sucks.

The pizza here is truly mediocre. The crust is really bland and floury, the cheese and toppings oozed grease all over my plate, and the service was non-existent. I had ordered water to start off with, then nobody came back around to see what else I wanted. Also, the pizzas here take 30 min to cook, which is pretty ridiculous.   I have been to other places nearby that have much better pizza and that only take 10-15 min to cook.   NYPD: Sorry, but you fail at pizza making.

We just stayed here two nights for Comicon... it was not a pleasant experience. This was our first time here and we were excited to stay at a luxurious 4-star hotel (really it's like 2 stars) and enjoy their pool and hot tub (not expecting all that blood... read on).   The GOOD: the hotel itself looked nice, the lobby was an inviting place to hang out, our king bed and pillows were really comfy, and things seemed nice on the surface.   The BAD: the towels in the bathroom are like sandpaper (not soft or luxurious at all... these were more fit to wash a car with), the refrigerator in the room was so small we had to smash and bend our to-go food containers just to fit in there, and there was no microwave in the room. I ended up finding a couple teeny tiny microwaves in an open area on the 4th floor, but they were so small it wouldn't let my food container actually spin around to heat thoroughly. There was nothing else in that space... no napkins, no plastic forks / spoons, no paper plates, etc., just a couple cheap and tiny microwaves that barely worked sitting on a table. It seemed like an afterthought for Sheraton guests, not a notion of 4-star service.  The UGLY: We could have stayed anywhere, but we stayed here specifically because of the pool and hot tub. When we got in the hot tub, we noticed a considerable amount of blood pooled right along the lip/rim of the hot tub that oozed down the side wall into the water. This was at 10pm on Friday. Gross, but stuff happens and we din't make a big deal of it. Now, fast forward 24 hours... we go back Saturday night thinking surely it would have been cleaned up. NOPE! Not only was it not cleaned... there were more spots of blood! They could have been there the whole time, but we just really weren't looking for them at first. Not just in hot tub, but along the pool too! We saw 5-6 areas along the deck where someone might sit and along the inside rim were someone's leg might hang were a good amount of blood had smeared and dried.   Maybe this was a prank from one of the zombie people at Comicon or maybe it was real blood... either way, the fact is the Sheraton people didn't bother to check or send anyone to clean any of that up in a 24 hour period. We had to go down to the front desk and tell them ourselves. We did not get to enjoy the pool or hot tub, in fact this experience was pretty gross, yet we paid full price for the ability to do so. The front desk people didn't care to offer any discount or try to make it up to us in any way, yet again showing no notion of 4-star service.   This place overall is a solid 2 stars with a 4-star price tag. I can still feel the sandpaper towels on my skin when I think about them, they were that bad.

This is a great little dog park, usually half the park is grass and the other half is dirt. Lots of people use this park so at any given time there should be plenty of pups for your pups to play with. It's also right next to Horizon Park, so there's lots of other stuff to walk around and see with your pups.

Dr. Rooh is fantastic. My fiancee and I have been going to him for a few months now and he has done wonders for our back pain and headaches. The trick is to stick with the treatment schedule and the more you go, the better you feel. I would recommend Dr. Rooh to anyone. He's very friendly, jovial and really makes you feel at ease before doing the treatment. I often like to tease him and call him my "crack dealer" since he is so good at cracking my back and neck.

Justin (Elite Floor & Furniture Cleaning) did a fantastic job cleaning the carpets and tile in my parent's new home. He really went above and beyond and was very prompt and dependable. I would recommend him to anyone. He's a really nice guy too, and he takes great pride in his work. Thanks again Justin!

Service was non existent and they did not make me feel welcome at all here. I came during lunch because I had bought a Groupon, but they told me my Groupon does not apply to the lunch buffet (why the heck not, I do not know) so fine, I'll pay again for the lunch buffet. I have never found so many bones and hard, inedible bits in my food at any other place I've ever dined at. In one plate of food, I found 7-8 of these that I had to spit into my napkin. I told the waiter about it and he seemed totally unfazed like this happens all the time. This was NOT a pleasurable dining experience and I have since refunded my Groupon. I will not be coming back here.

This has become one of our favorite sushi places here in north Scottsdale. The food is excellent and the prices are really reasonable. The fun part is they have a conveyor belt that goes around the restaurant, so you can just sit down at your table or at the bar and start grabbing sushi that you like, no need to wait or place any orders, unless you want to order some drinks or miso soups or whatever. If you don't see exactly what you want on the conveyor belt, you just tell the chefs and they'll make whatever you want within a couple of minutes.

I have been a regular here for about a year. The food is really awesome for the price (you can eat your fill for about $15). I recently stopped going as much because they got rid of my favorite role (the Mountain Potato Roll) and nobody of the 5 people I asked could give me a straight answer as to why. They just said "sorry, we don't serve that anymore." Well, that is too bad (talking to you Management) because it cost you a regular customer. I have yet to see them add anything new to the menu either, so the same old menu does seem to get old after a while.

I came here for lunch and was really not impressed. The lady behind the counter had her food-handling gloves on while she was sweeping the floor and cleaning up the place, and then she came over to take our orders while handling the money and cash register with her gloves still on.   Can you guess what she did next? You bet... she went right over and started handling our food with her dirty gloves. I spoke up and asked her if she was going to change her gloves and she replied "Why?" I told her and she replied "Oh, don't worry the broom is always clean." I explained again and she finally acquiesced.   OK, so now let's talk about the food... I had one chicken and one steak taco. The most notable flavor on the chicken was a burnt taste. She charred the crap out of it. Now on to the steak... it was overcooked to the point of losing all its juices, so it was very dry and chewy. Completely underwhelming.   This place is clearly an after-dark spot where all the drunken people from Whiskey Row can grab some fast food to soak up all that alcohol. To that crowd, things like flavor, quality and cleanliness probably don't matter so much. But to me, they matter very much and this place absolutely failed in my experience.

The owner (Nezza) is amazing and she personally delivered some flowers to my 86 year old grandmother on her birthday. Grandma LOVED it and said it was one of the sweetest presents she's had in years. MLP was fast, friendly and really terrific. I'd recommend them.
