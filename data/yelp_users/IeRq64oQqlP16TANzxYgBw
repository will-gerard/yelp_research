The worst customer service you could ever imagine!  I read the reviews and still bought a groupon because they are so close by our home.   They refused to accept our groupon because their computers were allegedly down upgrading their groupon program.  Their cashier Tereasa  had plenty of attitude in telling us that there was no way possible to redeem our groupon, so we had to pay full retail price instead!  She wrote a messy note for us to walk out and get our car back from the line of cars being washed!  She did not have a phone number for her manager, so we had to just chalk this one up as another failed effort for consumers to use a groupon at Danny's.

Love the Persian Room. Excellent appetizers and they make their pita fresh in the dining room.  The fresh basil, butter and onion they serve with their pita is delicious. Great service!

I'm surprised when I read the other reviews for this store.  We have been going here for years and have always had a nice experience.  Peggy behind the counter is helpful and sweet. Occasionally they are quite busy but are always pleasant and professional.

We love this little neighborhood cafe.  They have created an oasis in the middle of a parking lot of an aged shopping center.  We enjoy riding our bikes here with the family.  They have yummy salads and sandwiches and a great happy hour.  $5 bloody Mary's and mimosas all weekend
