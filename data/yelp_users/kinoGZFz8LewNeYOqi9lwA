Discovered this place yesterday night for a late dinner(1am), and was amazingly surprise. The ambiance, the decoration, the friendly staff. It was happy hour and we had the pork fries ($7) the portion was huge and it was really tasty. It's also a full bar and they make great cocktails!  We will be back for sure!

I came to this place at least 6 times and never disappointed!  Employees always recognise me and really friendly!  Prices are really affordable!  Normally I do acrylic nails but this time I want it to try their pedicure, it was awesome!  They spend at least 15min on each leg for massage!  The classic pedi is $22 and It was 10am when I sat and 10.45am when I left . Such a relaxing moment!

I really like this restaurant but I had couple bad experience and I  always want to give another shot. This time was nice, our server looks like he didn't have a lot of experience but he was really polite and nice. Food taste always the same, it's little hard to decide which pasta choose because they're all base with Alfredo sauce...

I went yesterday night for the movie at 10.20pm and I discovered something new, subtitles!  It's something that you ask when you take your ticket and they give you like a "arm" with a screen and it's connect by wiffi. This doesn't exist where I'm coming from. I think it's an amazing idea!

Hang out after work tonight,  we had couple beers and watched TV.  Our waitress was very nice ! We had some wings, burger and salad. Wings were really tasty , the fish that you made by your own has a really good size. But I order a chicken ceasar salad, and actually for the first time it was "spicy" ! My mouth was on fire, I have no idea what they put on , they were nothing wrote on the menu. I just wanted a regular ceasar salad, little sad.. it's a good place for beers, watching TV and eat wings!   And it's also good that they serving late so I can come after work!!

Second time here, food is great lot of choices,  services is good too. But maybe it's little over priced. Last time I had pasta with seafood and this time I took a ceasar salad and I added a 6 oz Salmon  blackened. (It was excellent! ) I recommended this place to my friends!

I was so excited to try this place after many people recommend this place. When we arrived we had to wait in the entrance for couple minutes.  Than we were placed at a table and the server came 5 good minutes later.  When he arrived we ordered drink and food.  We had time to visit all the shop and after wait at the table. The food arrived  and all our meats were dry and hard. The tabooli tasted like the presley was old... we all left more than the half of our plates and very disappointed..

I had my lunch there today, I know there aren't a Japanese or sushi restaurant. But I still order there spicy tuna and mango california roll and they are always good. Service is fast so it's good when you don't have a lots of time for lunch time.

Sometimes we like to go to Red Robin to eat my chicken crunch salad and my family some burgers,  we always take as well the dipping sauce they gave with the onions tower. And we are always disappointed,  the fries arrived at the table always cold. And we try many different locations and it's always the same..

Each time I went to this place , it was perfect ! The patio is small but nice. When there is a wait, it's always really fast. Employees are very nice and here to help you if you need. My favorites are the Asian Chicken Salad with an Orangina!  Perfect combo. And the price are very affordable. Love it!

Many peoples recommend us this place for there breakfast on Sunday morning  ($11). So this week we decided to went there. They open on Sunday at 11am, we were there at 11.20am. Service was really slow and king of long but when the food arrived we just forget all the time we wait.. The food was perfect, each ingredients in the plate has is own flavour ! Everything remind me Ireland, all the taste! ! It's a 5 stars!! For breakfast with a good Guinness on Happy hour!  And listen good music in this old fashioned Irish Pub !

Today was our second visit to this place. We were four at  table and we all ordered meals served with fries. When we received our fries they were way too salty (plus the seasoning)!  So when we received the last plate, we told the waitress about the fries, and asked for them to be replaced, she didn't comment, just turned and left. This was the last time we saw her, she never came back to the table or even looked at us! When we were all done (+/- 20 min later), the Manager arrived at the table to tell us that the fries were almost ready. We told him that it was too late and we wanted just the check. He apologised and proposed that we have a desert to go. He also took a discount off our check. I am giving them 2 stars because even though the Manager tried to do what he could, the Server ruined our meal. She didn't even acknowledge us when we left.

It's almost a 5 stars.. but the service need to be review. Our waitress wasn't paying attention to us, but all the others employees took care of us. I went there today with my brother for a brunch. We took the Chef board and the daily bruchettas and couple of glasses of wine. The presentation of the food is really nice and the taste as well (I love there abricots mustard! ). Since the summer is here we were able to eat outside with there beautiful patio. We will be back and we hope the service will be better.

Invited my mom there last night, found on Yelp that if you check in you have a free app.  Our server tell us that we can choose between app and bruchettas. We pick the Spicy Shrimp and eggplant and it's was delicious!!! We finished the spicy sauce with the warm bread!  We also found on Yelp some pasta with angel hair,  shrimp, caramelised onion,.. but they didn't do it anymore but the server recommend something similar and put shrimp instead of chicken  (without any up charge :) ). So we both had the Pesto pasta . It wasn't very flavoured,  we had to put some salt and pepper.. we will come back for a glass of wine and the amazing spicy shrimps and eggplant! ....and the patio is beautiful !

Was searching on Yelp for a breakfast place to go on Sunday morning with my family. Found this with good reviews. When we arrived at +/- 10.30Am it was packed and we had to wait outside for couple minutes but it was pretty fast ! Traditional American food,  service was efficient and fast, coffee was $ .90 !!! And really good!

My family and I went there and ordered 2 large, 1 small and 1 personal pizzas + 2 large salad for 8 people and it's was just perfect. This location is really nice but little bit too loud for having a conversation.

I had lunch there today with my brother,  we didn't have much time and this place was perfect for our timing!  We sat at a table at 1:30pm and we were all done at 2pm!  We decide to try this place because they had great revues! And weren't disappointed!  On the menu they have a category 15min or less ready, between 11am and 2:12pm. We ordered two sandwich, they were both really good size and good flavor!( $9.99 ) We will be back soon, we already told our friends about this place. (Lots of tv,  game room and a huge bar )

I had so much good time in this place those last couple years and today I had a bad experience!  Service was cheap and our waitress didn't know the list of beers, she had to come back two times at the table because we ordered something she said they have it and few minutes later she came back to say that they don't have it. The menu that she gave us were dirty and sticky.

Server always recognise us and remember what we usually order. Prices are really affordable and the food really good!  Always bring new friends so they can discover our favourite late stop  ( and dogs frendly patio ! )

Worst service I ever had! Join some friends on a Tuesday for lunch, we were sitting at the bar, we were the only customers  (6ppl) the bartender never said hi, she came to me and ask "What do you want ?!", so I ask for the menu. After a minute I made my choice, close the menu and wait for about 10min than she finally came back, I told her my order, but she seems doesn't really care what I was saying. She took the menu and left.  4 mens enter in the place, she went directly greeted them, she brought them waters, menu and them beers. At this point I had no water, no drink, no food. After taking there orders, she came back to me and said "Sorry I forgot, what do you want?" This was 25 minutes later, so no more time to eat, had to go back to work, so I left. I won't recommend this place to anybody!

I am the kind of person that doesn't know very much about cars and when I brought in mine, for the first time to Desert Car Care 8 months ago, it had a lot of issues. The Manager took time to explain everything to me and make sure that I understood. I had to do a lot of repairs on my car over the months, but now it works like a new one! I recently brought it in for an oil change and Mike and the team took great care of me.  I am really grateful for finding them and I highly recommend their services and their reasonable prices!!

My friends and I went there the week of the grand opening and we were so disappointed. I ordered the "No Bun" and it was ok. But for the "high" price there is no side comes with the burger ! Also the restrooms are located outside.. I'm not sure we will be back.

To be honest, I had never heard of this concept before they opened this location. I went there with my family and we did the "Cashout" room. (It was difficult but we had a lot of fun). You HAVE to work all together and that makes it really interesting, because everyone sees things differently. We were welcomed and guided by Nick and Ben, who did a wonderful job. They were both extremely friendly and very helpful. They answered our many questions in a very professional way. It was a great experience and I look forward to going back there and trying another room.
