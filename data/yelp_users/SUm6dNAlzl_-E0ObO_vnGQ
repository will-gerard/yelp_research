Sprint rep was rude and extremely unhelpful on the phone. I was put on hold 3 times for a totally of 16 minutes of wait time on the phone. The rep answered the phone and sounded impatient like I hadn't just waited 16 minutes to talk to him. Then gave me no assistance and the when I said goodbye he mocked my voice as he hung up. I can't believe how ridiculous that is. I have been a customer with you for 8 years. Get your act together!!

Great real Mexican food joint. Tucked away little spot. Gets pretty packed at night but never takes to long. Chicken taco are amazing! While you are there you can also pick up all kinds of munchies and alcohol. Kind of the perfect stop for your way home after the bar or a party.

Amazing experience! To start, I originally had an issue with my order but one of General Mangers, Kiel, took the time to fix the issue. One of the best customer service experiences I have had. With a company as large as jimmy johns I didn't expect that kind of service! Very refreshing! Also my sandwich and chips were delicious. Highly suggest the turkey tom with hot peppers, cucumbers, and onions! I love all the additional options you can get on your sandwich! They shouldn't be over looked, they can add so much! Don't forget the chips either, I suggest salt and vinegar! Yum!! Thanks again jimmy johns!!

Great little Greek restaurant! The staff is friendly and welcoming. Stumbled upon this place through groupon and really glad I did! Their gourmet gyros was amazing!!!! I will definitely be back.

Holy cow!!! That was an amazing sandwich!!! You knocked my socks off! I just had a turkeywich with shoestring onions and ate the whole thing and then wanted to go get another one. Yum

I have been living here for 8 months and so far I like it. One negative thing is that I have asked them to spray my patio 4 times for bugs and still it appears they have never done it. I have seen multiple black widows out there. And had to just go to Home Depot and get bug spray myself to fix the problem. Super annoying.

These donuts are so delicious you will swear there is crack in them! They are unlike any other donuts you will find in the valley. And the best part is you can make custom donuts too. I usually stick with the OC but they have something for everyone! Definitely a fun place to go.

Hi. I have been a loyal customer for four years enduring constant price increases and horrible customer service. But today really took the cake. I have been having billing issues this month due to an increase I was never informed about until already charged. I spent over an hour on the phone with a rep earlier in the month and got my bill down by changing plans. Today I was charged more than we agreed and more than it was suppose to be before I changed. I was also told I had a credit on my account, which is now 3 dollars less than what they told me I had. So today I called and spoke with two reps. The first rep was no help after I explained to him the entire story and then I was transferred to billing. The previous rep left no notes and I had to retell the entire issue. I have now been on the phone 45 minutes. The billing rep said he was working on the issue. Then after a few minutes of listening to him breathe, he on purpose hung up the phone. I waited for a call back, because he asked for my phone number. Nothing. He hung up on me at 6:01. I called back and the office closed at 6:00. I was hung up with on purpose after speaking with two reps for over an hour. Another hour of my life wasted. I promise you cox this bullshit is going to be on every blog, every social media site. That kind of customer service is unacceptable.
