My phone decided to spontaneously shut down after being exposed to too much sun and water and while verizon wanted to charge me 600 for a new phone, sun cellular went above and beyond to make sure I had my phone fixed the day I brought it in and for a very decent price. They even stayed past closing to fix my phone!    I had great conversation with the owner, Dan. It is really nice to know that your money is going towards a small business owner and not some greedy corporation. His kids were in the shop being little helpers and they were so cute! I would send anyone I know to sun cellular if they needed their phone foxed. They did a great job and did not overcharge me like most places try to do. While I am hoping I won't be a reoccuring customer (broken phones are the worssst) I will be a loyal customer if anything were to happen and I will be telling everyone to go see dan for any of their repair needs. They also repair laptops, tablets etc. so I will be bringing mine in to get my pictures recovered soon!  If you want friendly, fast, affordable and genuine customer service go to sun cellular!

Went here for the first time about a month ago and have developed quite the obsession.  after trying many a gyro( it's pronounced euro not guy-row ;) )and being in a mediocre haze from them all, I FINALLY met my match for pita cuisine. They were absolutely packed and now I see why. I honestly read through some of the negative reviews on here and thought..  "are you high???"    So let me break it down.  The pita bread is delicious and moist as if it was made that morning. I got the chicken schwarma and the chicken was so moist and tender it fell apart. It was layered with some sort of special sauce and rightfully so it WAS special. It was deelish. My fiance got the beef gyro and for someone who doesn't like trying any ethnic foods (meaning anything thats main ingredients aren't meat and cheese)  he was in LOVE. it was awesome. He also ordered the bachlava (sp?) Which was out of this world. They don't use honey in the bachlava so it doesn't have that sticky effect makes for a much more melt in your mouth treat.  So excited to have this place right around the corner. Service was great, food was exceptional and it has a nice mom & pop feel. (Buy local my friends!). Highly recommend it! I Also saw they have a happy hour from 3-6 5.50 gyros and drink specials. The owners are so nice i never feel guilty about spending money on lunch here!

DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH.   And by rough I mean its a rough area and you would literally have no idea this hidden gem was tucked behind all these small businesses.   The night to go??? Wednesday... *hummmmp dayyyyyy* woot WOOOT!   the best part of WR on a Wednesday night? TWENTY FIVE CENT BEERS. yes I said it. 25¢. How many things can you buy for 25¢... a pack of gum, a fake tattoo or a travel size shampoo??? Certainly not a BEER though right??? You stand corrected.   The place is packed with an array of different crowds all brought in by the wide variety of music (ranging from hip hop to country) and the extremely awesome, people watching. From the proffesional level country dancing to the twerking gone wild the dance floor is the place to be for people watching. If that wasn't enough they also have a wet T-shirt contest and ladies get in for free. BOOM. you , are, welcome .

We have since visited the westin again (cannot believe we went back after our first experience and with NO apology or compensation for our troubles) BUT...we had a great time and no issues on our second visit. We really love the lazy river and their super comfy beds!

One of my favorite sushi places in az. I'm from California so my sushi standards are high and while there is no comparison to Cali sushi, this is a close second. Ive tried about 6 sushi places in az and been dissapointed and felt totally ripped off but ra has some great deals and quality for your money.   My favorite is the seared tuna with a sweet onion sauce and their salmon roll with asparagus. Everything is fresh and fast. The bartender Eric ALWAYS takes great care of us and always has some entertaining and morally objective stories to keep us entertained.   They USED to have a great happy hour menu but they changed it and I am not impressed . I haven't been back for hh since the change and I hope they revert to the original hh menu.   One nice touch is they are good about pouring your beer/saki in a nice cold/hot glass and refilling it as it goes down. Its the little touches that matter!

If your looking for a 5 star restaurant that requires you to have your panties in a wad upon arrival ...this isn't for you. However if you are looking to be a very bad Kitty and get your hands on some wings,  burgers,  beer, and catch a game?? look no further. Just plant your ass right infront of any one of their huge TVs.  They are close enough to leave you crosseyed. The burgers are good, wings awesome and beer?? 32 oz draft 4 bucks on happy hour. I believe that's one step below a personal intravenous draft. Love it! Great happy hour specials, busy crowd and great service.  This was only my second time but I was pretty impressed...although they had me sold at happy hour so check it out for yourself!

Super underrated little joint! Food is awesome. They have all sorts of sliders to choose from that are so tasty. The prime rib sandwich is one of the best I've had in a very long time. The meat is sliced razor thin and has a melt in your mouth texture. We come here specifically for their fish & chips, fried to a golden brown with a coating of crunchy goodness on the outside of Icelandic cod, served with crunchy golden waffle fries. Seriously good stuff!! If you come for dinner on the weekend, hang around for a bit, as the night crowd gets pretty interesting...seems to be where the young ladies go (rich) husband hunting...and I'm not complaining! the crazy arm flailing & Cupid shuffle taking place on the dance floor is nothing short of entertaining. The people watching will keep you wanting more and the fast and friendly service will help accommodate your visual journey. They have a live band on the weekends as well. They are upbeat and play an array of music from disco to lady gaga! If you're a wealthy 40/50 something you may want to keep your wallet close but this place is definitely a find.

First let me start by saying their beer selection= heaven. The beer list, is not only in order of type (which makes it easy to find a beer you know you like and look Below it to find something similar to try out) but also alphabetical and progressive.   The food...DECENT. definitely not the selling point for this place,  but for a place that's selling point IS  a yard of beer...decent.    Service: very attentive, waters & beers always full, bartenders are great at making recommendations for beer (when your being annoyingly indecisive about  which fashion  you plan to get inebriated). Matt is my favorite! He makes great conversation and recommendations such a genuine person and a huge reason we visit yardhouse!   Bottom line, if your not  freshly 21 and stoked about drinking a beer out of a yardstick then this place may notice be AS amazing to you, but it certainly does not disappoint when your in the mood for some grub and beer! Food can be pricey, menu is huge and so are the entrees so there's no harm in sharing an entree with a friend...more room for beer!

I came here for my birthday and was so excited to try mastros after all of the awesome things I heard. We had a reservation and arrived a few minutes early out of courteousy and were told that it would be a few minutes for them to get a table ready if we wanted to get a drink at the bar. No big deal except that few minutes turned into an hour.  I have never waited an hour when I've had a reservation and would never expect that from a place I hear such highly things about.  We ended up spending 70.00 in drinks while waiting for a table and kept checking back at the host stand in which the last and final time she actually rolled her eyes. I was totally put off by the lack of customer service we were given regarding the wait. No manager ever got involved or so much as offered to buy us an appetizer or round of drinks. I feel that is the least they could do as that is standard for even underquoting someone's wait time who did not even have a reservation. After waiting an hour for a table which was supposed to be in the dining room we were offered a crowded table in the loud bar that had opened up. Starving, we took it. From then on is where the experience went up. The server was great and attentive and the food blew us away. I had the bone in filet (is there such a thing!??) And my fiance got the new York. Both were melt in your mouth amazing with a slight carmelization on the outside. By far the best steak I have ever had. It was well worth the wait but it was more of the principal that we came in to have a good time at a nice table and spend money and were not treated with importance and instead disrespect. I feel the situation was not handled properly and that for what we were paying and the quality of the restaurant a manager should have at least apologized for us waiting and not receiving the table we were supposed to. If we wanted to go that route we would have just walked in and snagged a table in the bar in the first place. I would want to try it again if I knew the experience would be different....although the steak was delicious the other issues left a bad taste in my mouth

Update: after writing my review about our less than satisfactory experience, I was promptly contacted by management. They gave a sincere apology and sent out a giftcard for us to come back. We came in on a random week day and enjoyed drinks, wine, salads appetizers and desert. The service was friendly and efficient and the staff at the front  of the door was welcoming and friendly. A huge improvement from our previous visit. The food was fresh, the recommendations were on point and our experience was memorable and lovely!

In LOVE with this place. No really. it's a little embarassing being in love with a mexican restaurant but they say you don't choose who you love right???   Z tejas...I have no idea what that means but it sounds nifty. They have a wonderful happy hour that is honored throughout the whole restaurant but the thing that keeps me coming back are the tenderloin street tacos. DELISH. not to mention their chips and salsa!   one thing I dislike is that you have to buy their chips and salsa its not complimentary and its not exactly cheap. They do however redeem themselves with the complimentary skillet cornbread that is absolutely delicious. This is the one restaurant I cannot stay away from as those damn street tacos keep calling my name. They also have a pretty mean frozen margaritas that can be stiffened up with patron floats!

Honestly, I cannot understand for the life of me why this place only has 24 reviews! First off this is the best nail salon in the valley for nail designs. They will hand paint, do any design, color or 3D art you want. It CAN get expensive depending on what you get. Last time i got a gel build up which is a healthier version to acrylics and then a gel color and it was 50.00. Wayyyy too much for my budget but otherwise their prices are reasonable they give massages with your pedicure. You need to be specific with what you want otherwise a lot can get lodt in translation...however they seem like very honest genuine employees and i look forward to coming back here in 2 weeks :) also make sure if you pay with your card to let them know to add the tip because you cant write it in after

VERY unimpressed by lush burger. At first, the atmosphere was cool. The food was pretty good but I had too bad a taste in my mouth from the staff and managements lacl of proffesionalism and customer service to enioy it. My husband and I both work in restaurants and we noticed other guests having the same experience as we did. Also the server called all the guys "boss" which for many is a HUGE annoyance, although he was very nice. Reminded me of something you would see on hidden camera from bar rescue.   As simon cowell would say...its a NO for me.

DISREGARD ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS BEFORE 2015.! This business has been bought and the guy that runs it now is awesome. His name is mendel. I called him for a friend after he locked his keys in his car and we unsuccessfully tried the coat hanger trick for over an hour and finally gave in and searched for a locksmith. It was 1 am on a Thursday so I wasn't sure what the cost would be but he gave us a very fair quote over the phone and was up front and honest. Beware of any locksmith offering to open your car up for 25-40 bucks...that is the starting Rate then they charge you fees for what kind of car you have, equipment they have to use and where your keys are located in the vehicle (why does that even matter!?) And it will end up costing you upwards of 200+. Mendel didn't do that. He gave us the full price upfront and arrived in less than 15 minutes. The car was opened within 5. He was friendly and personable someone I would use In the future if I ever ran into this problem again.

Ahhh jersey mikes. Sounds kinda like a truckstop you avoid on a long road trip but let me tell you my friends...it's definitely a stop you should make. The BREAD: soft, flaky and fresh. The MEAT: sliced fresh for every sandwhich. The toppings...different and very good.  You can order your sub "mikes way" and it will come with lettuce, tomatoes, white onion & LOTS of (too much imo) oil and vinegar... as for the prices,  i think the people complaing about an 11.00 samdwhich are failing to mention,  that size sandwhich is literally 3 meals! I get the regular sub which is still huge & end up eating one half for lunch & the other for dinner. You can get the mini which is plenty of food for ME (probably not enough  if your a guy or have a hefty appetite ) for under 5 bucks. One thing that constantly keeps me coming back is the customer service. I would much rather spend my $ in a place that takes pride in it's customer service,  listens, and gives you what you asked for than any other mediocre serviced sub shop offering a 5.00 footlong and an attitude.  Oh and another brownie point mikes scored on the board? They have fox news on. That a boy!!

Tanzy, I have one word...WOW.   OK , maybe more that one word but that one is definitely the sum of it.   I am basing my five stars not only for the hand crafted cocktails , atmosphere and mouth watering dishes but ESPECIALLY for the above and beyond service we receieved from Katherine during our visit. She had an abundance of reccomendations that time and again proved to be top notch. She was attentive without being overbearing and truly made us feel like we were not "just another customer" but a very important guest. The warm inviting service is what compelled me to take the time to write a review (besides wanting to share this hidden gem with others :).  We started off with the table side mozzarella which our server explained and eventually talked us in to trying. Boy were we glad! What a unique experience and a fun part of our date to pick our seasoning and accompaniments together. We paired it with a FANTASTIC suggested bottle of wine that I am regretting not writing the name down at this moment s my taste buds are already craving its soft tanic fruity notes followed by a peppery finish. What an absolutely amazing pairing. We also tried the carpaccio which I was a initially a little scared to try (raw meat :/) but it was surprisingly good. The calamari in a white wine butter sauce tossed with capers for a zesty finish was the highlight of the meal for me. We finished our meals off with a red velvet bread pudding which I found to be just what I needed to seal the deal but my fiance was less than thrilled about , only because his mothers bread pudding is and always will be the best he's ever had ;) ( who can compete with a mother's cooking??). Overall this experience was beyond memorable and I plan on returning for the inviting service and datesque experience tanzy has to offer. i will admit the menu IS a little pricey but in this case you really do get what you pay for !

HOLY BURGER BATMAN.   I had a friend suggest that I needed to go here to try they're creme brulee burger. Now,  being a California native, I know a good juicy burg , so I am used to people telling me how "awesome" a burger is (smashburger, cough cough) and putting that charred beef on the foodie pedestal only to get knocked off and sorely dissapointed....this however is a different story.   This burger is legend....***wait for it****....DARRRRRYYYY.  the bun , a brioche buttery soft bun, caramelized with dusted sugar , topped with a juicy, mouthwatering hamburger patty, topped with a fried egg, shredded lettuce, thick crispy bacon, tart pickled onion and finally smothered with havarti cheese. I was a bit iffy about the egg afraid it might ruin it...but out of respect for the creators concept I tried it in its original form ...and oh am I happy I did. Don't touch the idea of Changing it...don't add ketchup don't add mayo just stuff that delicious burger in your pie hole where it belongs and enjoy!!!   Side note: this is a mom & pop or realistically two bros kinda place and I love that they are successful in this economy . Try it for yourself & Spread the word . BUY LOCAL!

This review is for Karen. A friend referred me here after my normally awesome appointment at taglio was less than awesome and I ventured to find a less hoity toity, less pricey and better (for lack of a better word) hair stylist. I am SO glad she did. She truly is an amazing stylist. My hair had quite a bit of growth and the color i came in with is not the color I wanted to leave with. I was going for BLONDE. I was already blonde but the blonde I was going for was a new level of BLONDE. She consulted with her coworkers to help her decide the process she would use to get me where I wanted to be and decided to do a microweave with a base break. It was a long process about 4 hours all together but boy was it worth it. She took her time making sure every strand that needed to be foiled was, leaving the base break on long enough and then cutting my hair Exactly how I wanted with long beautiful layers that actually made my hair look longer. Unfortunately because I hadn't eaten before my hair appointment I had my first bout of "low blood sugar" and almost fainted in the chair! So embarrassing!  Karen was nice enough to get me ibuprofen,  water and a couple granola bars to bring me back to normal. Such a sweet and talented girl. I will be driving from phoenix to Glendale to get my hair done by her from now on!

This place is an amazing little secret hidden in the sea of restaurants we call the Scottsdale quarter.   It is a "type" of mexican food that is hard to explain. It's not authentic "the hole in the wall type place where you're afraid to use the restrooms) , it's not fresh mex (the type of Mexican food people who don't like mexican food eat) but we did come up with a name : MODERN mexican. It's decor is Spanish style decked out in tequila bottles, comfy tables, and an AMAZING patio with lounge seating.    The food is awesome.  I highly recommend the coconut calamari,  the gabernador taco (no way can I pronounce that properly) the grilled sweet corn, ANNND beer battered shrimp taco's. The one thing i didn't care for in my many trips was the tortilla soup because it was OVERLOADED with raw red onion to the point i felt it was inedible. The service has always been great and the drinks are wonderful.  Happy hour menu: the prices are not very "happy" but rather great recommendations of their specialities. Other than those few things the food, service and atmosphere keep me coming back again & again!

Seriously AMAZING. first off, 5 stars for the service she was so sweet and had wonderful reccomendations pertaining to the menu and drinks. She also gave us the history of the building which was really cool and was just all around one of the best servers ive ever had.   The food also gets 5 stars. The flavors are unique and complex. You feel as if the chef is in that kitchen cooking every dish to impress you. The pork cake (?) Had the perfect amount of crunch and savory flavor paired with a bitter arugula blend for a contrasting flavor pairing. The buretta was soft and creamy and their pomegranate jam is so delish!!!   The atmosphere makes you feel as if you are on vacation at a little cafe in france. Its really something else. Cant wait to return for dinner on the patio. An extra kudo for finding out that amazing server we had?? It was her first day out of training. That blew me away!

I freaking LOVE chopshop. I live a paleo/ whole30 lifestyle and they are always willing to look up ingredients for me to make sure it's paleo friendly. Their protein bowls are to die for and big enough to make a second meal of.   They have freshly brewed flavored iced teas such as blackberry, jasmine strawberry or peach and black watermelon.  They have delicious and fresh ingredients in all of their meals and their open kitchen gives it a homey warm feel. The juices are delicious my favorite is the liver cleanse. They also have fresh squeezed lemonade.  Healthy fresh ingredients that taste so good you feel like your cheating on your diet...but I assure you you aren't :)

There are few times In my life that I can truly say my dining experience deserved one star & unfortunately this is one of them. I've been to cold beer and cheeseburgers and gotten food to go plenty of times and my food was great. This time I dined in and was super disappointed.  I will also add, the servers work smart for their money not hard (I'm sure they do work hard but figuratively speaking) they collect a sheet in which you've already written your whole order down and also bring carafes of water to the table so you can fill it yourself, no complaints I like the convenience but this makes it that much harder to do a bad job  It started right of the bat with the hostess we walked in and she just stared at us like we had just killed her cat no hello just a stare...two for the patio please...her attitude and body language as we asked for a table on the patio screamed" you're annoying me". her reply was a brass "sure".  We pointed to a high top that was free and she stuck us at a table that could seat six nowhere near where we pointed.  Wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't for the harsh nonverbal bitchiness she unleashed on us.   We both got  the Wednesday special which was build your own burger for 10 bucks. We both ordered that plus a build your own mac. We ordered a coke and were greeted and the BYOB sheets were taken. The server never said her name. She spent the entire time being swooned over by two dueschy scottsdale guys In front of us, probably in hopes to score a big tip. (Although if service had been on par she would've scored one from us) .   Someone else delivered our food and there was one burger and the mac...so our server comes over and says she missed the second burger sheet and she'll get it out on the fly....My fiance waited to eat (i told him not to) so by the time my burger arrived which was fifteen minutes later...his food was cold. Both burgers were over done and dry. The fries were stale. The mac was really good though. His burger was missing the barbecue sauce that was supposed to be on it and while we waited to ask her for it she was no where to be found. When she finally did come over we asked for it but she first visited the table of guys in front of us to chat and bullshit so it took even longer.   We sat done and disappointed for ten minutes before she came back over to ask if we were done. She did get one of the BYOB taken off but as bad as this experience was our bill should've been taken care of. A manager never stopped by to apologize or see how everything was after the mess up and her apology was short of sincere. Her biggest concern was squeezing a good tip and attention out of the guys in front of us which is too bad because we both have worked in the service industry and reward good service in a big way.  I would love to come back and enjoy some cold beers and the game on the patio but not sure I can overlook the complete lack of sincerity and shitty service :/

Not happy about my first and probably last, visit....  I came with my husband and another couple on a tuesday night. We waited 20 minutes in line, which wouldnt have been a big deal except for the fact that they sell as many tickets as there are tickets to sell regardless of space or seating. We, and about 15 other people had no seats and there is no area to stand without being in the way of other patrons or the servers who are trying to squeeze by and weave. We did not find this out until of course buying a drink for each of us which we dropped close to 30 bucks on only to end up leaving because we were burdening the staff.   Why would you sell more tickets than seats knowing the layout of your own club does not leave room for standing? Probably because you make money on the tickets and the alcohol before anyone even realizes. Thats just bad business! We left and asked for our money back less than 5 minutes into the show when we realized there was just no way it was going to happen and the girl at the register was not at all receptive to that idea  . Eventually they agreed to refund our money but it has now been over a week with no refund. We lost money on drinks, tickets and most of all our time by this BS .   My advice: tell people when you are full then its "stand at your own risk" or put in more seats. Even better? Focus on customer service and return customers rather than squeezing every dime out of unsuspecting patrons before duping them.

Today was the first time at this location. First off this set up is awesome. It's like a better yard house mixed with the yard.  Couple notes: They could definitely try to enforce some sort of kids not to be left unattended rule because I could tell parents were letting their kids run wild. One of them was half naked so...there's that. Food is always consistent and pretty good.  One complaint (and this is my PET PEEVE!!! ) I asked for a side of ranch and it was hidden valley. We all know what hidden valley store bought ranch tastes like. I don't go to a restaurant and pay good money for them to cut corners and serve store bought crap. Please make your own ranch oh-so!!! It's the details that matter. I have been to the other locations and every time the service was awful...no awful is an understatement...it's like the owners just hired their friends they felt bad for and none of them went through a day of training.  BUT this locations service was organized and on par. Kudos to that!   I love that they are dog friendly and they do a Backyard style barbecue every Sunday with an array of foods. Really homey and cool. I'd check this place out if you are looking for a fun kick back atmosphere!
