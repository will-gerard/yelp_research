I was a bartender at Jupes off and on for 20 years! Love the owners, they are my family!! Never had a better job or time in my life, ice cold beer, frozen glasses, great clientele. You can shoot pool, throw darts, play the ass kickin jukebox or just sit and get tore up with the regulars!! The bar is kept very dark so let your eyes adjust when you walk in and if you are a Minnesota Vikings fan.........this place is for you!!!

Absolute worst service I have EVER received in my life! Went through the drive thru with my family and placed our order. We were sent to the parking lot to wait...OK, it happens, so we waited. It would have been nice for Chick-fil-A to give us our drinks while we waited, considering it was quite warm out and we had already paid for them but that didn't happen. We waited 20 minutes and FINALLY an extremely depressed person by the name of Kayla came out to bring us our food, literally dragging her feet!! You could hear her shoes....clump....clump....clump as she brought our order out to us. She say's absolutely nothing when she hands my husband the bag of food and proceeds to walk away. My husband ask "are you bringing our drinks next?" Kayla says in a monotone voice "you ordered drinks?" My Husband still being polite smiles and says "yes we did." We wait another 15 minutes and clump.....clump.....clump.....here comes our drinks. We say thanks and leave. Starving we decide to pull out the grilled chicken nuggets and snack on the way home. I kid you not folks, these nuggets we soggy, sponge like things that truly could not be actual food. Not sure what this restaurant is thinking or what kind of chicken parts they are using but it is not food! And the service....well there is no service.

I went here with my father in law and my 9 year old daughter. I ordered the chilli and it was served in a cup and cost me nearly six dollars, along with it came two packages of two crackers. I started eating the chilli and it was a little spicy so I asked for more crackers, well you would have thought I asked for the goose that laid the golden eggs! I have never come across a more rude Grandma in my life! She made all kinds of remarks and faces because I asked and then brought me two more crackers! She then proceeded to tell a story about a man that used to come in all the time and he was always dieting....she laughed and laughed because even though he dieted he was "STILL FAT!". I couldn't believe what I was witnessing! None of us at the table were fat either so I have no idea where that story came from.  Needless to say we will NEVER patronize this establishment again, there was nothing special about the food, service or anything else and I along with everyone else in the world can live without the meaness!

I see that I can update my last review and is that ever a good thing! It seems that Grandma can't take constructive criticism as since I wrote the review, she has now found me on facebook and began harassing me. This woman has got to be the most unprofessional business person I have EVER encountered in my life and I think I may just go to the news about her!

I will NEVER go here again! Kimberly gave me a mani/pedi and during the mani cut my cuticle back so far I bled then during the pedi, damn near rubbed the skin right off the top of my foot with the sugar scrub! She then proceeded to tell me I was too old for the color of gels that I asked for! I asked for french manicure on both toes and nails except for the ring finger nail, I want silver sparkle. She said "people over forty shouldn't have that, only teenagers" She then charged me 58 bucks....(no price break for making me bleed). I left for WI the next day only for the toe nails to start chipping and the gels to peel just three days into my visit with my son and new grand daughter. This place SUCKS! The techs SUCK, the product SUCKS and Walmart SUCKS for having them in the store!

Amazing place!! I was a walk-in on a Sunday morning and the place was packed! They took my name and gave me a questionnaire to fill out about my hair and what style I liked. I was barely finished filling it out and they were already taking me back. I saw a stylist named Kayla and she was friendly. personable and just down right sweet! She did a beautiful job on my hair and I hired her as my personal stylist. I would and have recommended this place to all my friends! Thank you Kayla!

I saw Third Eye Body Art when I was visiting the antique mall on Main St. in Mesa. It was early on a Sunday morning so it wasn't open but I looked in the window and liked the look of it! My daughter wanted a cartilage piercing but I was a little worried because so many piercing/tattoo shops are dark and scary. Not Third Eye! This place is bright, nicely decorated and immaculate! Robert the owner and the one that did the piercing was extremely professional, welcoming and  knowledgeable. He answered all of our questions and also explained the importance of quality jewelry, which is ALL he sells at Third Eye. We also learned  the plastic tapers my daughter was wearing in her ears, were toxic and you should never wear plastic jewelry! My daughter got her cartilage done and I got a Monroe. Robert's work is excellent to say the least! We are excited to have found Third Eye and to be writing this review. We will also be going to Robert for all of our future piercing/tattoo needs.

My husband and I work 6 days a week and trying to keep up with the house cleaning was brutal. We made a decision to hire a weekly housekeeper and started searching on craigslist. I answered an ad for Orbitz House Cleaning and asked when I could interview them as I would be giving them a key to my home and having it cleaned when no one was there. Rebecca responded with "We don't do interviews this is a cleaning business" I said "I realized that but wanted to know who would be cleaning my home." Rebecca's response was "No Thanks" I said "I'm sorry, this is my first time hiring a cleaner, am I supposed to be home while you clean?" Rebecca's response "You can be home if you want it doesn't matter to us" I said "OK, if I could be home during the cleaning I would clean it myself. I am giving you full access to my home while I am gone. Doesn't it make sense that I would want to know who you are before I give you a key?" Rebecca: "No, if you are that worried about it you should probably not hire ppl to come in LOL. No one is going to go out of their way to completely change how they do things because you want things your way. Good luck!" I said "Wow, I am glad I had this conversation because I as well as everyone I know will not be using your services. Good day." Rebecca: "LMAO! You clearly have a problem and we are not even there yet so I am not doing business with the likes of you. Bye Bye." Me: " Your lack of professionalism and people skills explains why you are a housekeeper." (I apologize to housekeepers around the world, I clean a clinic for extra money, I was just angry at this point.) Rebecca: "I'm not a housekeeper you moron I own a business and make a lot of money every day off of lazy Mexicans and lazy as f*** b***hes like you. What kind of woman can't even keep her house clean? Shame." Me: "You keep proving my point. I will be sure to keep this text so that people know who you really are." Rebecca: "B***ch, I don't give a f*** u r a lazy as* cow." I saved the text's for proof if anyone wants them.
