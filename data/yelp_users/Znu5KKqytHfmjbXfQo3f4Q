Hadn't been in a long time so went back to see Chihuly in the Garden, and remembered why I wasn't impressed the first time around. On the plus side it is very well maintained. But for me it was too much so. I think I saw as many little placards describing every plant as I saw plants. It feels far more like an exhibit to me than an honest garden of any kind.  I liked the diversity of Arizona regions they have on display, and there is some nice historical information, but overall for far less money you can get out and experience some of the great trails all around our state. Take the time and see it for real instead of in a plant-zoo.

They might be thieves! I brought them a very dirty, messy car and the one they gave me back... it couldn't have been the same car!  It was spotless, clean, and better looking than it had been in a very long time.    This new car had the same license plate as my old one... same stuff in the glove compartment, same bad music on my mp3 players, but was just too clean to be my old car.  Well, it looks fantastic and is close enough, so I'm keeping it!  I hope when this one gets dirty I can take it back and they will trade it in again for another new one! :)

CLOSED! Sorry to see them go. Apparently a Chick-Fil-A is going in, because the world needs more fast food places.  The owners are going to put together a mobile car wash rig so they can wash cars at people's office or home, but the location won't reopen.

Since moving nearby to La Grande Orange, I've lamented the amount of money I've spent at that most tasty place.  Now that I've finally made it to Postino, my lamentations will only grow.  Yeah, it's wonderful.  Carla greeted me at the door, chipper as only a Saturday night can create, and gave me a quick tour upon hearing it was my first time. She handed me off to Maya, who was also supremely patient with my many questions and general ignorance of wine.  Yeah, I'm not a wine snob. I have little patience for sniffing and swirling. I've good wines and bad wines, but I'm fairly convinced anyone talking about the boquet of light oak with a strong raspberry melon finish is making it up or part of a cult.  Didn't matter, though. Maya recommended a fantastic wine, and between her and Carla I sorted out which of their famous bruschetta I was going to try (proscutto + fig, salmon + capers, tomato jam + goat cheese, apple + brie).    The garage doors were open and the weather was fantastic. Loved the decor, loved the staff, loved the food, and loved the... what's that other stuff they served.., oh yeah, the wine.  (sigh) Between this place and LGO it may be cheaper for me to just move again further away.

Not often you go into a place with a person's name on the door and find that person working the register or cooking, but that's what you will find at Al's.  Been going here for a few years, but haven't tried much of the menu - the Chicago dogs and fries are just too good. Also recommend the beef sandwich, which comes juicy, tangy, and messy. And let me tell you, some of the best things in life are messy.

I've been a fan of Joe's BBQ and Joe's Farm Grill for a while, so was excited to hear Joe had purchased the old Liberty Market in downtown Gilbert and was reopening it with his touch of flair.  Joe did not disappoint. He kept the core building intact, with cracked concrete floor and flaky neon sign, but gave the seating a clean metal polish. The E61 coffee bar serves a mean espresso and a good cappuccino in a more Italian coffee bar approach (i.e. NOT Starbucks)  Breakfast has paninis and other hot items plus rolls and muffins for sale. Lunch and dinner has a wide range of items from wood fired pizzas to vegetable salads and the very tasty "Liberty Bowl".  Food is also available To Go, and there is a small but good selection of food paraphernalia. Outside seating on a small patio is perfect at this time of year.  Be sure to check out the open bathroom (common sinks) with 5 individually decorated Male/Female bathroom stalls. A shame they can't put a camera in there to capture the reaction as people go back there for the first time.  Another nice addition to downtown Gilbert, and very much worth a visit.

Farm House is a Gilbert icon, and I've been going since they inhabited the actual "farm house" down Gilbert Road.  Big, tasty breakfasts are the draw for me, especially the omelettes and homemade cinnamon buns. Gooey goodness!  Drawback - The Wait. If you don't get there early, it can be a heckuva wait. Be warned!

Dragged here by a quirky friend who insisted there was a restaurant down this alley that had good cake...  And she was right!  She was picking up a piece of cake for her boyfriend, and I just could not resist a slice of carrot cake.  It is a heavy duty cake as another reviewer pointed out, but I found it quite tasty and moist.  It is slab cake and not a multi layer one, but that is just different presentation to me.  Now for the name... I have to give them credit for the creative name, as it definitely sparks a discussion.  Maybe the only way to settle it once and for all is to try both at the same time...

One of three great Dilly's locations locally. I love the ability to get either a big, fat, honkin', juicy pastrami sammich, or something light and healthy. Both taste great, and it means Dilly's is a great spot for a group with a wide range of lunch tastes.

Visited with a group of people from work for lunch, and it was fantastic. I had the Shrimp Verde, and it was quite tasty. Several people had the hot, lava bowl and absolutely loved it. I have no idea what the proper name is, but seriously, could it be cooler than "I would like to eat the hot lava bowl?" No, it could not.  I was a little surprised at the prices, which were more than I usually pay for lunch, but it is because of the fresh, great seafood. It came out to about $20 for each of us for lunch, but well worth it.

First up, great coffee. It's a shame they have such tasty mochas, because here is a place you can get a solid cap or espresso without fear. Just too many decisions. Their homemade whipped cream is amazing, so I often open for the quad-shot con pana to light me up. It's fantastic.  Next up, friendly, smart staff. They always seem extra happy, which may be the constant buzz from the espresso and whipped cream rushes I am sure they cruise on all day.  Cap it off with tasty pastries, nice vibe and decor, and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in town.  The only downside at all is that it's popularity can make it crazy busy, so if you're looking to sit and relax or work for a bit, get there eeeeeeearly.

"We can say we tried it."  That was our reaction when we left. We drive by this place all the time, and it is usually packed, so when we had an open night we decided to see what it was all about.  We had stale chips, and possibly the worst "house margarita" in the history of house margaritas. It was more like a guest-house margarita. Maybe the outhouse margarita. My wife had the chimi, and liked it. I had enchiladas, and they were okay.   Oh yeah, and the seats. They are old booths, aren't holding up very well. Mine had a broken spring or something and the guy sitting behind me made me jump everytime he moved, and I think I did the same to him. Quaint seating is one thing - broken is something else.  I did like the home-owned, non-chain feel, but it just wasn't that great.

Great sushi and service coming in for dinner.  And fast!  We ordered four rolls and expected a little bit of a wait, but we weren't even done with our edamame before these tasty rolls showed up.  One of the better sushi places I've found in the Valley.

Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!  Place - Small. Food - Fantastic. Wait - Usually. Bathroom - An adventure.  We didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.  The bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!

Bad news for me... I just moved within biking distance of LGO. Yeah, their food is healthy and all these vegetarian and vegan options, but... dang. I like different and tasty food, and they've got it nailed.  Corn on a pizza?  Heck yeah.  Get in there and experiment!  As others have noted, parking is a bit of a pain but their complimentary valet helps.

Love this place - you can get a good "hardcore" coffee or a nice, tasty mocha. It also gets a nice blend of clients, and I never see it too full of hipsters or too full of laptops.  A great independent business - stop in and enjoy!

My my... I've been a fan of Romeo's restaurants and related places for years as they've moved about the Valley, and they are just superb. Su. Perb.  Big portions of quality food, friendly staff, and the desserts... gah... I've spent many evenings in torment because in spite of being too full from dinner I could not pass up that dessert case. But if I'm going to suffer, this is how I want to do it.  They also do a special wine pairing night that I have not had the pleasure of trying, but I hear is a lot of fun and remains on my To Do list.

I live in the area and have been going to Joe's BBQ since they opened 10+ years ago. So... I guess I should review it, but this mainly a Me, Too Review.  Great meat, fun place, tasty sides, good for lunch and dinner, are there drawbacks? Even when the line is long, it moves quickly. This place runs like a well-oiled machine... a tasty, tasty machine...  Best Texas style BBQ in the Valley, INMTBHO.

What the... I came to this page to send the URL to someone to show them how awesome CPC is, and Yelp was waving the Write Review button at me. I haven't done this already?  Weird. Maybe I just love CPC so much I thought the sheer force of my gastrointestinal passion for the place would write the review for me. Apparently not. But my love for this place abounds.  I'm not a veggietarian, but I do like a good veggie dish when available. CPC has a fantastic line of veggie pasties that many carnivores like just fine. Try the classic Oggie and Bangers & Mash, or my fave the Tikka Marsala.  They have several tasty beers on tap to keep any spicy choices under control, so cut loose!

Rolled in before my class at SCC, and had the place to myself. Snacked on the hummus and veggie platter (cilantro and jalapeno hummus was tasty and tangy!).  Sipped a lemonade, then got an iced coffee to go.  Wish this place was closer to my home, especially with the drive thru, but will definitely be back when I'm in the Scottsdale area.

Always struggle with great places like Wildflower Bread Company that has multiple locations. I love them all.  I've been a fan of WBC since they first opened, and tried many of their spots around the state. I'm partial to their soups and cookies.  One suggestion I have - take home a loaf of bread!  It's amazing how few people I see really buy a loaf of this tasty, fresh stuff to take home.  Get your wonderful meal, but get a bread to go!

Joe's restaurants are always interesting to review because they have so many facets.  Food - A wide range of food that is both tasty and fresh, I have yet to go with someone who couldn't find something they liked on the menu. Personal favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Sweet Potato Fries. I also like their milkshakes, though they tend to be more tasty calories than I should be packing these days. Most of the veggies and food comes from the nearby farm.  Restaurant - Retro furturistic farmstead? I don't know where Joe gets his concepts, but they are fun. The building is the old Johnston family house, and the fireplace in the inside dining area still looks like it is from the 1950s. Also, be sure to visit the restrooms.  Outside Area - My one downside to this restaurant is the free for all often found around the building. The grass area is a great place for kids, but too many parents seem to think this is a license to let their kids run around unsupervised. I usually opt to eat inside as a result, which is a shame because it is such a beautiful area.   Overall an honest recommendation for Joe's Farm Grill, one of the tastiest places around!

Probably my overall favorite coffee shop in the Valley.  Wonderful atmosphere in an inside cafe, inside lounge, and outside patio.  Amazing homemade muffins, scones, cookies, pies, and sandwiches.  Wonderful owners and employees.  Great coffee from the serious (they have a cubano actually written on the menu!) to the crazy, fluffy, lattes and mocha combinations.  Great for a quick snack, or lingering to chat or surf the web on the free WiFi.    Located NW of Higley and Ray, behind Joe's Farm Grill.

Another great meal and a new beer discovered back in the wine/tapas area. I love that they're knowledgeable about what they're pouring, not just pulling whatever name somebody grunts and points at.  I've eaten from every one of their "stations" now, and love them all. It sounds odd meeting someone for lunch/dinner at a grocery store, but hey, they get over it.  I usually take a load of groceries or other shopping stuffs (they have a lot more than just food) home with me. I live a fair distance away, which is a shame or this would be our regular store.

Had heard good things about Churchill's, but was very disappointed on my first visit.  Went with family to celebrate a birthday dinner, at 3:30 on a Saturday afternoon. There were only two other parties in the place.  In spite of the dead slow time, the waitress refused to help us split up a check ("You ordered appetizers, and those are too hard to split." Huh?), and seemed relatively uninterested in us most of the time we were there.  I wasn't super hungry, so asked to get the lunch portion of the Bangers & Mash after she talked about their homemade sausages. She said I couldn't do that on a weekend, but I'd want the dinner portion anyway.  That dinner portion had a pile of fairly tasty homemade potatoes, but only three halves of sausages.  Not three sausages, three HALVES cut lengthwise. So 1 1/2 bangers for a dinner portion.  That's not banging, that's barely mild thumping! And they were curled up from being overcooked. They seemed like they could have been tasty had they been cooked decent.  Oh, and the dinner special fried chicken?  All out for the day. At 3:30?  Seems like if you're going to run a dinner special, and have it on your special's board, you should, I dunno, HAVE the special in the kitchen somewhere.  My Guinness was also flat when I got it, and as I think about it... I started this review with two stars but I'm going down to one.  An English pub that can't nail a Guinness and Bangers & Mash might want to rethink their priorities. I haven't been this disappointed in a pub in a long time, and I won't be back.  Blech.

Never tried their old location, but their new one is quite the tasty.  I'm a fan of breakfasts, especially non-standard ones. I can get a Denver omelet any old fool place. I like places with unusual things to try.  At OE I had the chilqi.. chillilo.. (quick Google lookup) chiliques! Yeah, those. Not sure why I can never spell that. It's like there always seems to be too many i's in there. Anyway, they were very tasty and very tangy. I'm not a'feared of the spices, so loved it.  They were very busy, but the hostess ran down some of their signature dishes with me, and I'm looking forward to going back for some of their other dishes.  Sounds like it is a crazy place to get into if you go at peak hours.

I still visit once in a while, but have really lost my love of this place. The last time we visited we were seated around back towards the bathroom.. and then forgotten about. I had to go find someone to take our order, and they were surprised to see us.  The time before that (and the time before that) I've had to wave to get someones attention while 4 or 5 employees hung out and chatted near the counter.   The food isn't bad, but we've had over easy eggs show up cooked solid, a request for crispy bacon show up as soft and greasy. It's as if they aren't paying attention to details back in the kitchen either. We've narrowed down what we order to a few menu items that show up reliably.  Go if you aren't in a rush and aren't too picky about having things cooked to order.

Cartel is a mixed bag for me - their coffee is superb; their service is horrific.  They make a fantastic cappuccino, and have great toddy. Yet I rarely go for coffee alone, and the attitude of the people working there make it so I can only go with "purists".  I'm not talking about people trying to order "carmel macchiatos" or blended drinks, but people ordering things actually on their menu! I've seen customers harassed by employees for ordering a mocha, or wanting to put a pump of sugar in their cappuccino... to the point of never wanting to come back. It almost entirely rules Cartel out as a place I can take a friend or colleague for a relaxing chat.  To me, a good coffee shop is a combination of quality coffee and atmosphere to enjoy it in.  Cartel does have tasty coffee, but they have been failing horribly on the rest.  I advise against coming here with anyone other than hardcore coffee purists.

Since I had some poor customer service experiences at Cartel, they've really made an effort to improve. There is still some snark, but I haven't seen any rudeness in a long time. They're making a definite effort to educate or work with customers.  Their coffee has always been top notch, and if they continue to develop the service side of the equation they are going to be solidly one of the best coffee shops in town.

This was my second visit to Blue Adobe, and I won't be back. The first visit was for a family birthday dinner, about 10 people, and they had trouble coordinating our tables, goofed up our orders, and generally didn't seem to care about us much at all. But the food was tasty (once they got it right) so I thought I'd try again with the EVFN group.  Two of the staff seemed trying to help, but everyone else either ignored us or seemed inconvenienced by all of us ordering dinner and drinks. What a mess.  Now I know the service problem wasn't a fluke. It seems to be a restaurant living on a very good cook's skills in the kitchen, and those skills are the only reason it isn't getting a single star. For good New Mexican style food, I'd suggest Los Dos Molinos not too far away.

Krispy Kreme, I was so upset, yet relieved, when you closed all your stores. My self control had one less thing to challenge it, and my stomach had one less foe to battle.  Now you're reopened within 5 miles of my house.  This is a low blow.  Krispy Kreme donuts are good, but the hot, fresh things are like liquid evil... sweet, tasty evil.  So I'm really glad you're back, even if I'm mad about it.

Were looking for some thai food on the way home and saw this place in Yelp. It can be tricky cold-calling a restaurant to place a to-go order, but the guy on the phone was very helpful.  I asked for his favorite thing on the menu, and was a little nervous when he said pad thai... the most generic thai dish I can think of. I like pad thai, but I've found it is rarely the best thing on a menu.  So I grilled him a bit and he stuck by his guns.  We ended up with the pad thai and some tom ka soup, and both were fantastic. We went with Medium spice as we always do the first time we try a thai place, and it was tangy but not too hot.  We'll definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu and see for ourselves if the pad thai is the best they have!

Zipped over for lunch after seeing all the great Yelp reviews, and it was a definite experience.  There is no decor. It's noncor. Nadacor. Zerocor. A few tables, sign on the wall, and a counter. The menu was scrawled on a white board behind the counter, and it is the only place I've been in a long time where curry goat is on the menu.   So I'm not going take anyone here for the ambiance - so what? Their food was great. I had the jerk chicken, and it was falling off the bone. Tender, spicy, and incredibly tasty. It came with rice and a salad, and was plenty of food for lunch. I'll definitely come back, next time to try a beef pie.  Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll have goat pie... :)

Wonderful little spot in the middle of Gilbert that so many locals don't even know exists.  It can be a little rough in the high summer, but any other time of year it is wonderful for a walk and some wildlife exploration.  Or just to sit and think.

I was a big fan of Flancer's Gilbert location when we lived near them, so was excited to find they had opened a second location much closer to our new place.  Still one of the best, tastiest sandwiches (and pizza!) around, their new location doesn't feel as "quaint" as their original location, but that might be what they were shooting for.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Always love to see a great local business expand!

I was on a mission to cure the lonely condition of my stomach.  Well, maybe it was a dinner with some clients.  Either way, I found myself at the Mission for the first time and quite liked it.  Staff took fantastic care of us, and the food was tangy and tasty. We had the table-made guac, and I snagged some of their Fantasma (?) sauce made from Ghost peppers to spice it up. Spice it up indeed. Woo!  Mahi-Mahi tacos also had a bit of a kick, and we ordered them grilled so they were quite light.  Washed it all down with a few Agave Margaritas.  Not cheap, but well worth it. I shall be returning!

It had been years since I'd been to Hanny's, but after going there for lunch I think I should have waited a few more years. Maybe all of them.  I think the decor is going for industrial retro... something, but it comes across as soulless. The place would be well suited for a dystopian movie where androids come to lament their lack of humanity and try hard to be clever.  The food is okay, but not a thing on the menu seemed exciting. The servers also seemed bored and/or bothered to be there. The most exciting part of my lunch there was the elevator shaft you could look down. It has a glass floor so you can see down into the basement. The glass is probably there because past patrons threw themselves down there to escape.

A hidden away place I'd heard about but not yet had the tasty pleasure of visiting. Thanks two huge fans who live nearby, I finally corrected this oversight.  Split a bowl of their tasty chorizo stuffed dates as an appetizer, which was a mistake. Not the dates, the splitting.  These are "Get Your Own Dates" sort of dates, and I suggest trying them all by your lonesome.  Went on a Wednesday so the Vovo Special was Fish & Chips. It was quite tasty, but I think I would have rather tried some of the Mac & Cheese I've heard so much about, or one of their other dishes.  But I'll quite likely be returning, so not a problem at all to remedy.

Gangplank is a great technical and creative resource in the SE Valley, and hopefully an indicator of growth around the idea of co-working and collaborative environments.  We use the Hacknight as an opportunity for Ignite Phoenix planning, and everyone there has been incredibly supportive. It is just one of many things that would not have succeeded without Gangplank,

Had the Tempe CPC on my radar for a while, but this is a bit closer so I hit it for lunch.  Love the pasty! Had the Bangers & Mash, but there is a nice list of tasty options that could keep me coming back for a long time. Also a good selection of draft beer. I went with the Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA, which went great with the pasty.  Another good sign to me was that few of the customers looked anything alike. An older couple, a few Harley riders, some guys in suits, a few punk-looking gents... all there for the good grub. Looking forward to a return trip.

Waaaay overdue to visit this place. Stopped by on a way to a show at the Phoenix Theater, and had a short but tasty time.  Sipped a margarita and devoured a bowl of their guacamole to start things off, then moved to some chicken chilaquiles. Was NOT expecting it to be that big, and sadly left a bunch of them behind. Not for lack of trying, however.  All fresh ingredients and a fun atmosphere in the always entertaining Hotel Claremont. Service was also exceptional, and had a fun chat with all of the very attentive people who took care of us. Will definitely return soon.

I work on a local event called Ignite Phoenix, and somewhere in the mix we contacted Splinter Creative about helping us with the design and material for our event. We were completely new to this game and didn't really know what good branding and imagery could do for us. They stepped in, gave us some amazing ideas, helped us refine them, and delivered some incredible material that wowed everyone who attended.  So we asked them to stick with us for our next event, and they did it again. They keep upping the game, and I now work with them across several different business that I work on.  They've helped me through several difficult creative areas, and the end result is always sharp, professional, interesting, and engaging.    I prefer to work with people who are passionate about what they do, and do it well.  Splinter fits that bill perfectly.  Highly recommended.

Used to be a pretty good place, but has come apart since the name change. Food has been average, or just flat out cold/bad. Service is chaotic, and the staff seems always overworked or just not that interested in keeping up on service. It's like they expect to make money on the sheer volume for sporting events and don't worry about the rest.  I will give them love for their tater tots. A bag of mixed regular and sweet potato tots was one of my favorite things from their previous incarnation and I was thrilled they kept it.

So disorganized and confused. Twice they have screwed up our prescription. The first time was a minor inconvenience, and we just had to stand around while they sorted it out. The second time, though, our dog has been sick and without his medication.   We received a call from them needing to confirm our address to ship the meds, even though we've done business with them before. We called and gave them all the info. They told us it was shipped. After nothing showed up we called back and the very same tech we spoke to the first time said they had no record of our call. Meanwhile our dog's cough returned.  It makes me concerned that we're receiving the right medication, and that other problems might surface because of their inattention to detail. When you're dealing with drugs for your pets, you want it to be correct. With Diamondback Drugs I just don't have that confidence.

Can't say I swing through downtown Mesa that often, but we may have to do it more often to get some Thai. This is one of my favorite cuisines, and everything was so tasty we brought home leftovers. We never do that as it usually just leads to horrific fungal growths as it sits uneaten for a few weeks, but not this time.  Great food, good service, wonderful little place.

This is well outside our normal stomping ground, but we stomped in while in the area based on Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.  We did not eat anything remotely health, but everything was spectacularly tasty.    Big loaded hot dogs and tasty Italian Beef... it's a good thing I don't live in Chicago (or near Boomer's) or I'd be in deep (fried) trouble.

Wings are not my favorite type of food, and I find most "wing bars" to be about the same. So when the East Valley Friday Night (#EVFN) Tweetup headed here I didn't have high hopes.  The wings were good, the beer was even better. I was honestly impressed by the excellent selection on tap, including some crazy stuff I had never head of before.  It satisfies both the Pickiest Vegetarian and Pickiest Beer Snob I know, so is on my list of places to take just about anyone to relax and have a good time.

I've just come so close to giving up on this place. The only thing I consistently enjoy here is the selection of beer. I can't recall the last time I haven't had one or more of the following messed up: misprepared food, wrong order entirely, horrible service, incorrect bill, etc. I have several friends who like the place so now only go here when one of them selects the destination. The beer list is fantastic, but isn't worth the rest of the headaches.

Sadness. I love Cherubini, and I hear they are closing.  So many mediocre shops in the Valley and we're losing one of the good ones.  Fun staff, great coffee menu, tasty food menu, and super yumtastic assortment of donuts.  Get there before they close. Tell them they're awesome.  Enjoy a coffee and a donut.    Then make a pout-face on the way out.  Sadness.

They say love hurts. I love FnB, and the place hurts me.  Trying it on the recommendation of many friends, we snuck into the counter on late notice to give it a try. We had to try the appetizers, right? Oh, and they were so good not a scrap survived.  Our main course - same problem.  Stuffed, whimpering, we saw them trot out the desserts. Oh no, no... but we had to try them, right?  Moaning, aching, we waddled out of FnB stuffed to the top with good F and B.  If our poor bellies survive, I hope they toughen up as we want to put them through the challenge again!

Went here after an Ignite Phoenix event and had a fantastic time with friends on the balcony upstairs.  Ate some ridiculously tasty Animal Fries and had several drinks. Everyone in our party got their food very fast, and it was all quite good.  Not sure I'd care for the indoor restaurant area ambiance, but the patio and balcony were great and I'd definitely return!

I've never had PT before, so wasn't sure what to expect when I was referred here. Turns out I had nothing to fear.  My Physical Therapist, Colleen Smith, is fantastic. She was not only patient as she worked to understand my injury, she was flexible and continued to listen to me as it improved over time. Watching her in action it is clear she is hard working, dedicated, and genuinely cares about everyone who enters the clinic.   The techs are also focused and attentive. The front desk is professional and welcoming. The facility is clean and well maintained. The entire place is great, and if you sadly find yourself in need of physical therapy, this is the place to go.

Disclaimer: I've known Steve (the owner) for a few years and he's a great guy.  Disclaimer: I'm also a coffee dork and even though I know Steve and he's a great guy I wouldn't pull punches if the place wasn't up to par! Disclaimer: I think I'm addicted to disclaimers now...  This place has great coffee, a great space, and a great attitude. Steve roasts his own coffee and is very passionate about the quality of the beans he's producing. If you catch him there, ask him about it at your own risk. You will get a LOT of great info.  There is a lot of thought in their menu, though it may not be apparent at first. For example, there are no blended drinks (like Frappucinos) not because Steve is a coffee snob, but because the blenders make a lot of noise and he wants people to be able to relax and work without being disturbed. Their space is very flexible with several couches, tables, and chairs for a casual conversation or to get some work done.  The coffee menu is also fairly simple, encouraging discussion between employees and customers if there is something specific they want. The staff is very accommodating, and willing to help or explain.  They have a nice set of food menu items to accompany the drinking portion of things.  It's a very well rounded, very great addition to the local coffee scene!  Disclaimer: This is the last disclaimer.

Okay, gotta write this quick... I may pass out...  I went to ASU when the old Stan's Metro Deli was on Mill. Loved that place. But it went away like so many good places on Mill, and I moved on.  So I was shocked when I saw a sign for Stan's on Mill driving in to work this morning.  A mirage? An illusion? I had to know, so wandered in for lunch and found out today was their grand opening.  I tried their #1, a triple decker combination of gastrointestinal destruction that puts both pastrami AND corned beef together on rye.  Oh yes, oh sweet yes.    They were a little crazy on their first day, breaking in a new staff and menu, but they got us all taken care of.  The #1 is now a happy memory, and the...sleepies are... coming... so good, but sooo... mmmm...zzzzzzzz....

I'm slurping their pumpkin spiced soup from the bowl.  It's tasty soup, but I shouldn't be slurping it. I've been to The Center Bistro 4 times since they opened and the consistent theme is good food, horrible service. They just don't seem to know what they're doing, even though they appear to mean well. Goofed orders, charging incorrectly, forgetting that they were in the middle of taking an order... it's kind of silly.  Their redeeming factor is a tasty menu. Today I ordered a half-order of their mill salad (dates, feta, greens) and Pumpkin Spice soup. They walked away from the cash register while I was ordering, kept forgetting what I was doing there, and finally took my order after 20 minutes. Then, suspecting the worst, I asked the woman as she handed me my to-go bag if there was silverware in there for both soup and salad. She said Yes.  I should have known better and checked, because apparently she eats her soup with a knife.  The other two people I went with also did not get a spoon for their soup.  Maybe they're Spoon Nazis ("No Spoon For YOU!"), but I think they just have a creative cook in there who doesn't have experience running a business.  Tasty food will earn a few extra chances, but when every visit results in frustration - I give up.

Yeah, down to one star. I am not exaggerating when I say every order I make here is wrong. Every one. I went back because some friends were going who love the place, so I figured the odds HAD to be on my side for once.   After I ordered my sandwich, which came on 9 grain bread, I heard the cashier tell the next person in line they were out of 9 grain. Huh? Did I get the last slices? So I asked, and he said I would have to pick ciabatta or rye. I dislike ciabatta, so asked for rye - as did the guy behind me. Guess what I ended up getting? Go on... guess. Ciabatta.   The food is tasty, but I think the people who work here start every day by getting drunk out of their minds before they open. Or maybe they just have my picture behind the register with a note to Screw With This Guy. In that case, they are doing an exceptional job. I give up.

Margaritas and... well, I'm already pretty much sold at this point. But the And ended up being some wee, tasty tacos. Went for Happy Hour and enjoyed a very nice house (sorry, "casa") margarita with a selection of their taco platters.   Fish tacos were my fave, and I confess to not trying the mushrooms. Fungus doesn't belong anywhere except under a log, people. Especially not in a taco. But the rest of these trays and their relaxed seating and awesome patio make for a great place to get happy after work.  For bonus points, sit near the bathrooms. The community washroom confuses first timers, and you can give a stinky eye to anyone you see leaving without washing their hands.

What a mess. Food was ok, but service was horrific. They didn't see my order on the ticket so everyone at our table got food but me. Then they dropped it. My food finally came after everyone else was done eating. It was decent, but not worth the extra deluxe wait.   They didn't clear the table. Someone spilled syrup and they didn't wipe it up. Had to flag her down for refills or anything we needed, if we could find her. I'm writing this at the table waiting for them to finally take our check. I knew I'd have time. We joked our server had a second job at another store nearby because she kept disappearing for so long.   Ah, she just took our credit card so we can finally go. Was worried we would still be for dinner.  Go elsewhere. This place doesn't have its act together at all.

Been here several times, so quite puzzled how I never got around to writing a review. Maybe I just assumed everyone knew what a wonderful little place this was and reviews weren't needed.  Well, just in case, this is a wonderful little place. I never have the same thing twice because everything is so tasty. This most recent trip I had their sweet potato tacos, which were full of flavor and texture. They have a lot of vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other nutty (or nut-free) dietary choices, but that doesn't phase me. I'm a devoted carnivore, but will happily eat a vegetarian dish if it is well done. And The Herb Box does them well.  Stop in for a nice, light lunch out of the heat and away from the bustle of the Scottsdale Mall. Well worth a trip!

Expected a lot more based on the other reviews. Cappuccino was a little bitter, and I was surprised that their default was to serve it in a paper cup for drinking it there.   The barrista was nice, but seemed bored. Cute decor, but so echoy it was tough to have a conversation. Walking down to Paradise Bakery might be a better option for anyone seeking good coffee at the Biltmore.

I don't think I'll be going here much anymore. See, they have this cookie. It's chocolate chip. And has nuts. And maybe something else that's illegal and addictive. And they're big, and they're soft, and I cannot stop eating them!   And all the weird tasty coffees! I love their Miel, which is a tasty, lite drink that reminded me of a chai. They also have a Filthy Chai, which is just a bit dirtier than a Dirty Chai. And today I tried the Gredo (?) which is a white chocolate with cayenne pepper. They are all so good, and have so many tasty calories!  But I love the way the place is decorated, and the barristas are great. So maybe I'll go there and hang out and stubbornly refuse to eat all their tasty, tasty goodness.

Glad to see a nice, friendly coffee shop open in Arcadia. Their big, open front doors are especially nice for sipping a coffee in the early morning during the Fall.  They use locally roasted coffee (Passport) and locally baked pastries. A nice selection of teas as well, including Thai iced tea, which I don't often see on coffee shop menus.  Staff is very friendly, but they are still learning and there are some consistency issues. I like cappuccinos and no two people there seem to make them the same way. But their official Grand Opening isn't until Halloween, and it always takes new places a while to work out the kinks. Hoping for great things!

We live in the neighborhood so were excited to see a new place with a huge range of beers open up.  The decorations are a bit sparse, but we like to sit on the patio or the conversation areas near the bar, which are perfect this time of year. Yucca chips are personal favorites, as is the gnocchi bolognese. Burger wasn't bad, but a burger is just a burger. They're still adjusting their menu it seems, which I expect any place to do for the first few weeks as they settle in.  I really love their commitment to craft beer, especially Arizona beers. $5 pitchers of AZ beer before 5:00 is not only quite a tasty offering, but appeals to my love of all things local.  Give OHSO a try!

Stay away! After some minor scheduling issues they installed my windshield, but will NOT stop calling me. I've had over a dozen follow up calls from these guys asking "is it pitted now? Do you need it replaced again?" I've asked repeatedly to be taken off their calling list, even telling them I'll consider it harassment if it doesn't stop.  They still call. My next step will be filing with the BBB and exploring what's necessary to pursue them for phone harassment and not removing me from their call list as I've asked.

Being a fan of Nimbus beer I was looking forward to trying their Scottsdale location. Sadly, I think beer is more their strong suit.  Went with another couple, and got a seat quickly (good). Our server took our beer order and recommended the Monkeyburn Fried Jalapenos as an appetizer. He brought the Monkeyburns (good)... but no beer (BAD!). We had been nibbling, and in dire need of thirst quenching from the spice, when he showed back up asking abou the food. Uh... BEER PLEASE.   Food took forty-five minutes to arrive (BAAAD). Apparently one of our dishes was goofed up (bad) and they wanted to fix it (good, but duh), and he just didn't bother to tell us until we flagged him down to ask WTF.  The food was good (good). Had the Green Pork Pot, and was so hungry by the time it arrived I inhaled it (bad (for me the next day)). Our server just couldn't seem to get it together, chatting with some friends of his at a nearby table. The kitchen also apparently didn't have it's act together, and a beer place that doesn't get you beer on time?  Sadly, won't be going back.

Went for drinks and dinner. While many people here praise the drinks, I had a nasty one. It was called the Bali something-or-other and came in a tiki mug. This, in hindsight, should have been a clue, but at the time it sounded fun and different. Everyone at our table tried it and made a face of confused horror. They were entertained watching me try to finish it for the next hour or so. I failed.   Others in our party liked their drinks for the most part, but it seemed pretty hit or miss. Maybe the bartender was trying his own product a little too much last night.  If I go back, I'll skip the drinks.  Oh, and they have a giant wall with all their drinks written on it, and after I stood there reading the wall they hand me a menu saying the wall is out of date and to go off the printed menu instead. I get that it has to be a pain to update that wall, but they made the decision to put it in there. Seemed rather amateur to me to make a wall sized menu and then have to tell people to not pay attention to it.   The food was much better than the drinks. Went with the 3 dish course, and it was more food than I needed by a long shot. The crudo (raw) part of the menu was fantastic. The risotto was quite tasty as well. Had the pork belly to wrap things up, which was incredibly tasty but about as fatty as you can get. The desserts were all amazing, and I had a few bites of the cherry strudel before giving up out of concern I may explode (and the headache my drink gave me).  Service was fantastic, and the decor was nice but spartan. Overall a good place. I'd give it a 4 for Food and a 2 for Drinks. I went with an overall 4 since they are more about the food, and we had no complaints there. If I go back, I'll probably do a few of the tasty crudo dishes and dessert, then grab drinks somewhere else nearby.

Tasty new addition to the Old Town Scottsdale area. Went on their opening day for lunch, then back again for dinner. They're still working out new-place kinks, but nothing serious.  For lunch I had the spicy brat and sweet peppers. For dinner the chorizo sausage and chutney. You can't go wrong on either the basic or premier sausages, but if you're unsure what to try go for a sweet/spicy combo. Like the spicy brat and a sweet topping, or sweet brat and spicy toping. If you like sauerkraut, it's all homemade (like the sausages) so give it a try. If you don't like sauerkraut, you're a strange person and should probably not go to a bratwurst house. And I feel bad for you. I'm sorry.  Where was I... oh yes, their belgian fries are great, and I am a fan of the sriracha aoli dipping sauce. Of course, they pretty much had me at "sriracha".   Their beer list is very well rounded. I'm not a huge fan of belgians and german beer, so was a little worried, but there is plenty of great beer there to drink across the whole spectrum. Chatted up Ben The Beer Baron for a while, and he definitely knows his stuff. Don't be shy about asking him for recommendations.

I couldn't decide between 1 star or 5 stars. See, we had been trying to get into Bertie's for a while to try one of their milkshakes, so we waited until we were really hungry. That was a small tactical error.  We checked out the cool, vintage outfits and decor for a while (I bought a smokin' "Greg Brady" green and orage shirt!) before rolling up to the soda fountain. I ordered an Elvis Presley Milkshake, which had chocolate, banana, peanut butter, and like 8 other tasty things in it. The wifey went for a red hots + cinnamon beast called the Sophia Loren. We watched, fascinated, as she created these two... beasts.  Served up in a traditional milkshake glass, they were backed by the giant metal shake container they were made in. And they were so, so, tasty. We swirled and slurped and sucked them down, only to refill them out of that damned metal shake container. I really don't know how much shake I ate, because things started to get hazy. But it was so damned good I couldn't stop. By the time we staggered out of there our tongues were happy but our stomachs were about to burst.   But really that misery was my own doing and my inability to put down the straw, so I can't be mad at Bertie's. Since I'm drooling while I write this just thinking about that milkshake, I'm sure I'll be back.  They don't serve much food, but for a tasty treat and some retro shopping, Bertie's is the best.

If you like tasty cold treats, you must check out Snoh!  I don't say "ice cream" or "shaved ice" because it really isn't either of those things like I think of it. And if a few friends hadn't raved about the place I doubt I would have checked it out. Shaved ice didn't sound that exciting. Don't make that mistake - this place is great!  I had the shaved thai tea, almond cookie topping, and black sesame glaze. I had no idea what I was ordering, so asked the super friendly guy at the counter (Tony) for advice. It was nice, light, and super tasty. My wife had the taro, shaved almonds, and caramel glaze. Hers was more savory than mine, but both were delicious.  The place also has a great vibe. Super clean, with some slick art on the walls. A TV was playing a dubbed asian war movie of some kind that was fun to watch. They also have games on one of the tables up front to keep kids (and adults) entertained.  If it sounds interesting but you're not sure what some of these flavors are like (taro?), don't let that stop you. The staff was great and can help you put together something nice and safe or crazy and adventurous. Either way it is seriously refreshing on a hot Phoenix day.  This is one of our new favorite dessert places in town. Get in there and try it out!

What a mess of an experience. Decided to try them at the Scottsdale Arts Show. They had a healthy line going, so I gathered bad things I'd heard must have been fixed.  Nope.  I'll give it as a list. People were getting their sandwich an hour after getting in line. We waited a half hour for ours after ordering, but not sure how long we were in line before that. A half hour for a grilled cheese sandwich... at a food truck? Ridiculous. They could have told people about the wait or done other things to help, but nope. People ended up comparing the time stamp on their receipts to try and figure out which order things were coming out in and when they might get their food.  So we got the food... and my wife's order was wrong. I had a special order, which they got right, but she ordered one of their standard options and they messed it up. We debated complaining but, what, wait another half hour to fix it?  The sandwiches were okay at best. They came out nice and hot, but just not that exciting. Certainly not worth the wait and hassle on a food truck that doesn't seem to have their act together.  "Grilled cheese" is a comfort food that people love, so I think that's where they're getting a lot of their draw when they show up. Pass them by and hit a different one of the great food trucks if you have an option. I've never seen a place put so much discomfort in comfort food.

A definite meh. We live nearby and had been excited for them to open, but gave them some time to shake of the New Place Bugs. I guess they need a lot longer.  The staff was friendly, but didn't seem to know what was going on. Nearly every question resulted in a run to the kitchen to ask, and then we had to flag them down again to get the answer.  Lots of options, especially if you're a fan of sushi rolls. They seem to really like tempura, as we went six rolls in a row asking "What's that one?" and finding out it had fried shrimp in it. Does anything scream tasty raw fish like rampant deep frying?  Food came fairly quickly, and tasted okay, but then we had two more bouts of misheard requests from our server and it had passed from silly to annoying by that point. We had one regular roll, one mid-range roll from their list, and one of their top end rolls. I'm trying to recall the exact names, but I can't, which I guess tells you how memorable they were.  And I have no idea why the place still looks like a Pizza Hut. Just not the kind of place I want to relax in and enjoy some sushi.  Not horrible, just not that special. I'd almost prefer a chain like Ra over them. If you really want great sushi, look elsewhere.

Love this place for the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  Went in hungry for a traditional breakfast, but bailed on that nonsense in a hurry. They have a bunch of different egg benedict dishes and crazy pancake combinations that we just couldn't resist. We tried a pancake flight with the sweet potato, blueberry danish, and the swamp monster (Pancake of the Day). Then we did a combo order of the chilaquile and havana benedicts. I haven't eaten this much food in a long time, and it was all fantastic.  Elise was our server, and took just superb care of us, including answering my usual string of stupid questions about a new place and its food. Apparently the little "sparkles" that decorate everything there are called a "compass" and each letter stands for a different thing.   Even the mugs and flatware are quirky, and we loved it all. We will definitely be back when we finish digesting the breakfast we ate this morning... so maybe three months or so. Ooof!

Stopped by for Taco Tuesday and had a great time. Love the decor and feel of the place. The house margarita was tasty, and worked well with the chilis I had as an appetizer. Both the chicken and veggie tacos were great, as was the service. Definitely will be back.

If you're not close to this taco shop, that's okay - it's worth the trip.  They saw we were first-timers and gave us a free sample of every meat they had. It didn't help us much as there wasn't a bad one in the bunch. We each got a plate of 5 small tacos and it was plenty. I wish I could tell you which ones we got, but after the nap we just took I can't remember. I know they were all tasty, and all on the bottom of the meat listings (the ones with the spiciest footnotes).  The decor is odd, but I really don't care - I'm going back for the food. Yum!

What a disappointment. First, from the name we assumed there would be more beers on tap, or that the difference would at least be clear. We were surprised when our beer showed up in a can and an overly chilled pint glass.   Well, ok. We made an assumption so I guess that was on us. Unfortunately things didn't really improve. Our waitress had very few suggestions for us on the food, so we made our own guesses and went with the green pork stew and the chilaquiles. These were the only high point of the evening. Both were tasty and rich and presented beautifully other than my tortillas being a bit soggy.  Once we were done we sat and waited for another good 15 minutes before our waitress returned. We realized we hadn't seen her at all since right after the food was delivered, so no idea where she went. Other employees passed our table repeatedly  but didn't offer to clear the table. It gave me time to look at the decor (nice) and count the many security cameras (6, that I could see).  When our waitress finally reappeared, chatting with someone from the nearby wine store, we were closed out quickly. There were five employees all milling about the center of the place near the POS screen and they all continued the tradition of ignoring us that had been the case all evening. Not a single Thanks, Goodbye, or even a Good Riddance. It was like they just didn't care.  We won't be back.

Small little place that you may have to look for, but well worth the effort. Had great food and tasty cocktails, in a nice little spot that felt very comfortable and welcoming. I've been eating my way around the menu, but two standouts so far are the Shrimp & Gritcakes appetizer (even if you don't like grits!) and pretty much anything they have for dessert. Tasty, wonderful stuff, and worth (trying) to save some room for.

Heard good things but they were closed when we showed up. Their web site said they were open. It's 2015 - businesses that don't update their information online are maddening and unprofessional. Thanks for the messed up dinner plans. :(

Heard about them for months, finally got in there to try them. Dear Past Jeff, screw you for waiting so long! This place is fantastic.  We went in a little unsure where to start with all the flavors of wings up there, but they took great care of us, shot us some samples, and got us connected with several flavors to try. We grabbed a basket of fries to go along with it as I thought we may need something to cool our tongues - it was the right call. My nose was running like a faucet from the heat, which is - in this case  - a good sign.  Great staff and some of the best wings I've had in the valley. Will be back soon.

A good place, but perhaps a little... confused.  We had never been to a First Watch before, so were excited to try this one out. Our hostess took great pains to tell us how this location was focusing on using fresh, local ingredients in everything. She then set down a pot of coffee for us and let us look over the menu.  We poured the coffee and realized the only creamer we could get wasn't fresh or local, but was little pre-packaged creamer cups on the table. Being a fan of local coffee roasters, when she came back I asked where the coffee beans came from and she said it was their own brand and packaged out of state. She made a point of telling me I could buy some when I left.  So the first two things the fresh and local focused place did was offer us fake creamer and out of state roasted beans. We were getting nervous.  Fortunately things picked up from there. I tried the avocado toast, which was fantastic. No skimping on the avocado here, and it was lightly seasoned to let the natural taste shine through. My wife had a skilled, which was also really well done and tasty.  They have a nice section of their menu focusing on healthy and lighter fair, which I'm looking forward to trying on future visits.  We could tell the staff was new, but they were trying hard and I'm sure they will work out the kinks shortly. The place is cute and decorated well, and their patio looks promising when it cools down a bit.  I was surprised when I was asked to name a tip amount at the register rather than being able to write it on the receipt like most places, but perhaps that is how all the First Watches do it.  So I think my concern came from the way they set expectations. If they hadn't been touting fresh and local so much I probably wouldn't have wondered about it. The coffee was good no matter where it came from, but I do think the creamer-cups were a bit cheesy.  We'll definitely be back, but we'll pay less attention to their branding and focus on finding more dishes we like as much as the ones we had today.

I hate to say it, but this place is a hot, noodly mess. I went on opening day, but try not to judge places until they've been open at least a week. So a week later... possibly even worse. Not a good trend.  The cashier said she started that morning and did not know the menu.  The guys on the line seemed really disorganized, and two of them were grabbing ingredients for the ramen with their BARE HANDS. I asked the woman calling orders about it, and she reminded them to put on gloves. Is that something you should really need to remind your cooks? Ugh!  It took 45 minutes to get our noodles, and they were bland and completely unexciting. On the way out we saw the manager (owner?) laughing and chatting with some people, while his kitchen was losing its mind and customers were getting peeved at the wait. He needs to shift his focus a bit or he'll have plenty of time to stand around and chat when his restaurant closes down.   No plans to come back. If I get a hankering for noodles there is some thai and pho not too far away.
