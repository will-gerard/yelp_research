Food was good...typical Macayos but the service was truly the worst, most awkward experience I have ever had(and I work in the restaurant industry). I left a 10% tip which I have never done in my life. Starting with being sat, my mother wanted a different table and the girl said "I was just taking you to where the hostess told me." I don't care why...a more proper response would be absolutely or okay would have been a better improvement. Then comes our server...that's where the real awkwardness and bad service starts. This man should not be in the service industry, in fact he probably shouldn't be in any profession that deals with people. A couple highlights...he dropped off my moms food and then said he had the wrong dish for me and had to go back to the kitchen. During this time I watched the "wrong dish" just sit on an adjacent table...I'm sure someone else was wondering where it was. He comes back a few minutes later and shocker...forgot my dish. Comes back a few minutes later with it. Forgot my moms baja sauce and comes back with that. It was cold(my mom didn't realize that it is supposed to be cold) so when we point that out...our server in a very condescending way let us know that it is cold and if you want it heated up, you need to let the server know. Well ok we are letting you know and we'd like it heated(not a smart ass) response. Came back with it and it was still cold. Finished eating and needed boxes...waited no joke 10 minutes before I flagged someone else down and we got them right away. Waited for our check..got that and paid. We had 3 boxes and two little containers and our server didn't offer or bring a bag(not that I expected it). I will not go back and I've been going there my whole life because I would be terrified I would get that same server. I get the same quality food without the really weird, awful service at another place a block away.

Centro is a hidden little gem. Tucked away in corner of Scottsdale and Shea, it is a great place to have a relaxing drink or worldy glass of wine. The food is great and hits the spot and more importantly it is served until 2am. The crowd is a great mix and always warm and friendly. The servers are always genuine and make for a very warm, welcoming experience. I've met the owner, Kasey, a few times and he is always so gracious and shows a consistent interest in making sure that my experience is steller. We need more places like this in Scottsdale. Good food, great service, accomodating hours, and steller energy and atmosphere. Keep it up Centro, you are keeper! I'll be back!

Best Gyro in Scottsdale! Meat shaved perfectly thin, pita warm and fresh and sauce equally as tasty.  My new spot for my gyro cravings. Opa!!!

I am not a yelper but I am so impressed by Midfirst Bank and this location I had to. I only wish I could give them more than five stars. Every employee is beyond fantastic and their hours are not to even being close to being competed with. Gavin is a very genuinely helpful person and there should be more people like him; I am just lucky he's at MY bank!  I am only upset that I did not start banking here sooner and I now wonder why anyone would bank anywhere else. Thanks Midfirst Scottsdale!!!!

This location was very disappointing. My pizza took 50 minutes(was quoted 30-40) and when it arrived it was cold and appeared to have been sitting for at least 30 minutes. What was the delivery guy doing? I can understand being last on a route but not sacrifice that much quality. I live 2 miles away from the location FYI. Never again.

I have to give it one star...but I'd give it negative stars if I could.  I used to love this place...I brought many different friends there many different times and I am ashamed I did. Reason being for my review(and I've never 'yelped' before), my friends were treated awful there and not by just a server the manager/OWNER. I won't go into the details of the story; I will just sum it up.  Food was poorly prepared, brought to the attention of rude, incompetent server and then enter manager/OWNER. You'd think or hope he would be the one to save this situation but in fact he made it worse for my friends and him in the end because everyone we know will never give him our business or a second chance. He was rude, unwilling to fix or admit a situation, caused a situation that other patrons witnessed. Good luck

Every time I come here the entire staff is so warm and welcoming. I love the steak burrito and having a few dos Equis at the bar! Ani the bartender is always so friendly and on top of everything. I go in for the food but mostly the people!!!! The manager Mel always stops by and says hello and welcome back. It's nice to go to a place and consistently feel special. Go check it out!!!!
