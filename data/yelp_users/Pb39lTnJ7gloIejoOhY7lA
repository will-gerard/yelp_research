I have been having connection issues in Tempe for 6 weeks. I've been told time and time again by reps that the "towers are being upgraded." I thought going into the store and speaking with staff for more information would be helpful. Not only was the sales representative rude, the manager refused to meet with me. She had the rep tell me that she "was going into a meeting and I could come back tomorrow." I'd made an appointment online prior.  Unbelievably bad service, never mind a breach of contract. If the phone can't make calls because your towers aren't working, I will not be paying for the phone.  I am very disappointed in the lack of customer service from a company who receives more than $1500 of my money a year.

I've been receiving massages for 10 years -- as long as I've been running. I've never before been to a studio as peaceful, calming and healing as Space. John is truly a craftsman. He is interested in his client's needs, listens, is respectful and without sounding too dramatic -- a healer. I keep telling friends he is magical; they look at me like I've lost my mind, until they too visit Space. There is simply no better massage in Phoenix.
