Not good! Overcooked food, pre made drinks, and underwhelming service. I'll never go back to this location ever again. I gave it 2 tries, once for lunch and once for dinner, both times were subpar. Ribs were dry, broccoli wasn't seasoned, steak was overcooked, cheese dip lacked any kind of flavor, and the pours behind the bar were laughable. Lesson learned, NEVER AGAIN.

Thee must try sushi spot in downtown Phoenix hands down! Using authentic black rice to craft classic, and modern twist rolls, this really is a place to see. Beware, lunch hours are to accommodate the business crowd in downtown so offerings are pretty limited (mostly grab and go style) but for dinner Harumi's transforms into everything you want from a sushi restaurant. Check it out for yourself!
