I must admit that tonight being Christmas Eve was not the best night to go, but they should be prepared for the business that they're going to receive on Christmas Eve.  We ordered $85 drink and food for a party of four.  The staff that Sally had on that night was insufficient, badly equipped, very impatient and rude.  Our appetizers Eggrolls, Crab Ragoons were cold, geasy and soggy!  The soup was Luke warm to room temperature! I brought it to my servers attention and she never came back to the table and totally ignored me the table next to ours have the same problem I don't know what their outcome was.   After dinner, I took the Sally the owner aside privately and told her that I was not satisfied with the appetizers but the dinner was good!  I also told her the soup was cold.   This was not the first time I've had a complaint with China Chile.  They always have an excuse!  Denying anything that they did wrong and make they make no exceptions on the bill and offered no apologies.  Sally is always right!  I will never spend another dollar in that establishment. There are many other Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix metro area to go to that are accommodating and respectful to their customers!  China Chili's decour is dated and cheap! The atmosphere makes you feel cheap and cheated.  Lighting in many areas is poor The food is expensive, it's mediocre at best!   The bathrooms are filthy dirty and there's no hot water in the mens room.  I intend to call the health department!  If they can't provide hot water and a clean bathrooms  in the establishment,  I shutter to think how dirty the rest of the restaurant is and what other health codes they are breaking?    There is absolutely no excuse for saying NO to the customer when they say they are unsatisfied with the service or food!    She's going to learn that one dissatisfied customer can create fifty more by social media and I intend to be the one to make her learn that!  If I were you I would dodge a bullet and never frequent this business!       I found it absolutely infuriating that she had the audacity to come to our table and tell me I was wrong and that she would be willing to do nothing and offered no apology no exception on the bill. I must also inform everybody on YELP,  that we tipped the waitress her 20%. Unlike Sally the owner we realize that it was a holiday and that her employees should not be punished for her lack of poor management.   I also need to mention that we all became ill after the meal and I am sure it had to do with the Eggrolls and the Crab Ragoon.  I wasn't as sick as two others that decided it was too much of a hassle to complain about it. So I only ate half of each.   I frequent many restaurants here in the Phoenix area and I would do yourself a favor and avoid giving this establishment your hard earned money and respectable business.   There is a new business that seems quite impressive,   a restaurant directly across the street from China Chile that has excellent food,  excellent service ample parking for the same money!

I personally recieved a screaming phone call from the owner  very upset I left after scheduling two appointments on the same day.   The barber no-showed on my first appointment and then called me and told me to be ther in 20 minutes....I showed and made me wait 45 before I became upset and left.  Then he called me screaming inappropriate things acting in a totally unprofessional manner  I hope this will help you make a better choice selecting a better Barber then I did.

03/10/13  Breakfast at 11.00am.  Party of 9.   I recieved my Eggs Benedict , and there was a piece of blue plastic in then.  I discarded it on the side and continued to eat only to find another piece in the sause and a broken tooth pick.  I informed the waiter and after 10 minutes he broght back ONE EGG ...not a complete plate.  RUDE and unprofessional.  I was very upset especially knowing my gratuity was going to be automatically added at 18%   Talk about a RIP OFF.   Then another guy in our party had a green fragment of something in his coffee.     I found the place to be dirty, cold food, poor service and over priced.  The front hostess was quite unpleasent as well.   There is something to be said for a , "Godd Morning!"   "How was your experience?"   NOT AT ALL THE WAY SHE CONDUCTED HERSELF AT ALL.  Very sad thinking your going to enjoy a nice breakfast and enjoy friends only to be treated poorly from an establishment .  BTW, Eggs Benedict and Coffee with Tip was $18.00 wasted dollars.  I'll stick to the establishment not to far away ...with excellent service great decor , freindly attentive staff, clean and excellent value with great drinks.  SWITCH

Staff was very professional and friendly.  The hotel was clean and quirky but nicely appointed.  I was impressed with the money they were putting into the place.  Our stay was ok.  For the money it should have been better.  No hot water....we told the front desk at checkout and we felt we were dismissed and quickly blown off.  "Sorry about that"  "We will report it to maintainence".   We also were rudely awakenend by construction directly below our room by hammering and loud noise.    We were dissmissed about that as well.  Kinda spoiled the stay.   The construction noise went on until checkout so we coulndt even enjoy the pool.............  We should have been warned in advance and we would have stayed another night.  I was very dissappointed.  The Casa Bianco eats were excellent...really wonderful.   The service was OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The Food was as well.  I wish my review was more favorable about our experience with the hotel....SAD.  I was so looking forward to a good experience on our Staycation.  But COLD Shower,  Noise, and being Dismissed was and is the result of my review.

I recently purchased a Infiniti Certified M37S from Coulter Infiniti.   I actually went into the dealership to look at it 2011, Preowned Saab 9.3.   I have been a past customer of Infiniti and have had the pleasure of owning three of them in the past.  But now that I am retired,  I thought it was more appropriate to down size in price range to look at the Saab.   The day before an Independent Dealer had shown me a pre-owned M37 2013 that was very attractive and had low miles but it was not an Infiniti Pre-Owned Certified vehicle and had No Warranty.   White, with Tan Interior Tech Package.   I went to purchase the vehicle from that independent dealer the next day and he chose to sell it to somebody they gave him a $500 deposit. I was furious.  I drove straight to Coulter Infiniti to look at the Saab again and was just going to end the daunting task of shopping for a car and buy the Saab.   My Sales Professionals name was Nader. He was just terrific to work with and very accommodating and wasn't in love with this inventory but motivated to sell. Being in sales for 38 years I can appreciate a talented salesman.   He had the Saab ready for me to look at and I told him the story about missing the chance to buy the Infiniti M37 from the Independent dealer.   He suggested I look at the preowned M37's  they had.   I fell in love with one of his cars and with the dealership.    There was very little negotiation because I was very happy with the price we agreed-upon and it allowed me to purchase an extended warranty on the car.    I can't say enough about Nader and his management team and Coulter Infiniti.   Because of Nader and his professional sales ability I spent three times more than I originally went in to spend.   There were a few things I wasn't happy with cosmetically about the car and expressed my concerns to Dave in there Service Department.    Coulter Infiniti has a Concierge program when you purchase a car from them.  It has many benefits! One of them is that they pick up your car from your home and deliver a loaner vehicle. What a Deal.    Dave was terrific to work with and very professional, understanding and I appreciate him going the extra mile for me by refinishing the alloy wheels on the car and giving me a new windshield at no additional cost.   I can't say enough about Coulter Infiniti and they have earned my business for life.     Thank you Dave and Nader. You truly made my buying experience a pleasure.    I LOVE MY CAR!!!

We had a bad experience last night.  We arrived about 6.00pm.  Party of 12.  I'll mak e this short and sweet and bullet point my review.  1)  Food,:  Ok  2)  Drinks: OK 3)  SERIVCE:OK .  With a few exceptions.  Our server felt it required to resight the establishments policy in regard to split checks in a very rude and corrective manner.  In short,  we where treated like children.  One statement she made rings in my ears..." OK, Well thats not the way we roll,  we dont do that.  I'll make an exception for this one gut...but thats it.!"  " Is there anyone else ?"  As she was ovbviousley very disturbed and put out!  I sat there and was shocked at her tone and delivery.  Then a few others at my table requested separate checks because they were leaving early.  I had just arrived and everyone had just been served.   I saw no reason not to get a separate check.  She then became very upset and said,  "OK,  we dont roll this way.  In the future we cant do this, I'm just saying.  OK?  She was tototally out of line.  From there it was a disaster....DOWN HILL.  When accepting large parties and establishment needs to state policy in writing or verbally on the phone or at the beginning of presentation.  I am willing to give WINDSOR  another try because another server saved the day in the end...but it was very embarrasing for all involved.   And yes that finally split the check after we were scollded.  Thanks

everything the previous poster and reviewer said was absolutely true.  the same thing happened to me.  i have called the about damages to our property they caused as well and they have not responded.....its a scam    they wont even return phone calls.  karina said email the claims dept and we did with no reply.  we are currently taking the matter up with the states attorney office and bbb.   i have a feeling sheriff joes office would be interested in these stooges as well.  in any event beware   they are not a legitimate moving company.   read everything in the previous post....its all true.  PREVIOUS POST...These scammer movers advertise on Craigslist under multiple listings and multiple names in Arizona.  They advertise without a company name included in the ad.  Things to look for in the ad:  2 men & 1 Truck, 3 men & 1 truck, 4 men & 1 truck.  They have their own trucks.  1 hour trip charge (they multiply the trip charge x's the number of movers, so at a glance it appears the trip charge will be eg: $38, but if you have 3 men, it will be $38 x's 3).  When they arrive they want you to agree to fees not outlined in the ad.  By that time you're stuck because they arrive on the day of your move.  They want things like $38 extra for each large screen TV', $38 for anything over 100 lbs.  $58 extra for stairs, $38 for refrigerator, etc.  They also hit you with 19% fuel sir charge which is not based on mileage or fuel usage, it's based on 19% of the total cost of the move, including the additional charges they tac on.  They will not unload the truck at the new destination without being paid in CASH.  They more than doubled my estimate from $720 to $1610.  They advertise they accept credit cards but they don't because they are scammers and no legitimate bank would do business with them.  They hire young english speaking women, usually with hispanic accents, to answer their phone with generic company names like, "Moving Services" or "The Moving Company".  None of the phone numbers advertised in their multiple Craigslist ads match the phone numbers that they actually  use.  The men are middle eastern and very prejudiced against women.  For example, they maliciously moved all the contents from my 2 car garage at the old place into the living room of the new place.  We're talking industrial size metal shelving, shovels, rakes, seasonal holiday decorations, power tools, and much more.  My new tile floor was scratched beyond belief due to all the heavy, sharp edged metal corners and scraping of the the heavy industrial shelves that are not designed for gentle indoor living.  I would list the names they used during my move but I doubt they used their real names.  I have been flagging their ads daily and they repost them within hours using the same cut and paste descriptions of their services but they change small things such as their generic company name, (none of the names they use are legitimate LLC's or actual registered businesses), they also will change their location so that Craigslist will allow them to repost..  In my experience the workers do not understand english, only the 51 year old chubby one speaks broken english and he does not work, he directs and supervises 'his' men and spends most of the time playing with his phone.  It was he who directed the men to unload an entire 26' truckload of garage items into my new living room.  He asked for a tip for 'his' men at least 5 times.  I told him any tips should come out of his profits, since he's the one who told them to put the garage stuff in my L.R. and he was the one who was 4 hours late, he was the one who promised to bring back 4 men to fix the garage/L.R. fiasco and didn't do it.  I ended up spending 2 full days removing legitimate living room items from my living room so that I could get to the garage items and move them into the garage.  You may ask where was I when the garage items were being unloaded?  I was at Walmart at 10:30 at night pulling cash out of my debit card $100's at a time buying packs of gum and other small items so that I could pay the the cash they demanded.  They doubled the cost of the move so all I had was $800 cash when we finally arrived at my new place which was 87 miles away.  I gave the chubby one my $800 and they agreed to unload the first truck but wouldn't unload the other one until I came back with the cash.
