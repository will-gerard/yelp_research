I've been wanting to go to Culinary DO for a while. It is a three-dollar place so we can't really go often for financial reasons. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It comes with ham, bacon, mayo, tomato and lettuce on a pretzel bun. OMG it was so bland. Bacon was just ok. Chicken dry and bland. Pretzel bread hard and flavorless. I was so confused. French fries looked delicious but were dead. Husband ordered the ribs. Ribs were fantastic but again WTF on the fries and his coleslaw was like practically from a grocery store deli. Nothing special. Really disappointed. Went there years ago. Got the Fried chicken which was delicious. I feel with the exception of the ribs everything was IHOP or Denny's quality. Service was also slow. But who cares about service when it is the food that matters.
