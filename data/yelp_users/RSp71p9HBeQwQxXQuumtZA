I love this place.   I usually sit downstairs. It is almost like you are walking downstairs into a dungeon. The atmosphere is very warm and cozy, dim lighting.   The menu is great for brunch, lunch  or dinner. But their happy hour is by far my favorite. Probably one of the best in the area.  The appetizers and wine by the glass are only $5.00 each. Five dollars for high quality food, such as tuna wasabi sashimi, scallops wrapped in bacon, and steak tartare. And an amazing wine selection to choose from.   This is a happy hour where you can eat a couple healthy, high protien items and drink a glass of good wine, all for under $20.00.   Do not get me wrong, I would still go there any other time, other happy hour and pay double. Its well worth every dollar.

Brand X is an original, and unique custom T-shirt store.    I have been going there for years.  I will come up with a cool idea for a t-shirt for myself, or a friend, and they have the talent to put it all together.   The owners, and the graphic desighners are all very talented and helpful.   For those who have never been there, it is a 3 step process.   1. You pick out the style shirt you would like.  2. Then you choose the font style and colors.   3. Then you can add any additional graphics you may like.  You actually get to sit with the designer ,on the computer and create your idea together.   The pricing is very reasonable. Around $30.00 a pop.  The advantage is you will be the only person to have the T-shirt you created. Also, a very cool idea for a personalized gift for someone.   To my friends at Brand X.. You guys rock!

Gallo Blanco is a cool, hip little place.   It has a very simple design. Very fresh ingredient menu.  It offers the kind of mexican food I enjoy. Its fresh, healthy and high qualilty.   I started with chips and guacamoli. By far the best guacamoli I have ever had. I believe they put oranges in it.  Then I had the fish tacos. Also very good. I ordered 2. My server suggested I get three because they are kinda small.   I am extremely impressed by their drink menu. I am not a huge drinker. Probably because most places use bad ingredients that contain high fructose corn syrup,  MSG, or tons of added simple syrup (sugar). Their drinks were all high quality, natural, fresh ingredients.   They by far, have the Best Bloody Mary I have ever had in Phoenix.  There was fresh dill in the homemade mix. Unbelievable!

I hate to even write a bad review,  but in this case I feel I must.   The experience was bad.    My boyfriend and I met met some friends at Zipps for lunch, and some drinks on Sat.  The restuarant was not super busy.  Our server was not attentive at all.   During our dining we had to continuously remove all of our own glassware, and dirty plates. Literally 6 empty glasses at a time.   Then she forgot our second drink order. When she finally got around to bringing it, I asked her for a pickle. She rudley smirked and said, "we do not have pickles."  I know this was not even true since probably 98% of all sportsbars in America have pickles.   I was a little upset about the service.  I have worked in the hospitality industry for years, and the places I have worked have high standards. You learn to keep tables clear of all dirty items, and you try to accomodate your guests with the things they ask for.    When she brought the bill it was $70. We still left her a $10. tip. My boyfriend wrote her a little note just explaining why it was only $10.   We eat out all the time. We are usually very generous tippers.  If the service was up to standard, and attentive as it should have been, her tip would have been double.   I am sorry Zipps. Im not super eager to return.

Windsor is as good as it gets. Great design, great atmosphere, great service and great food.   The place is very cool. It has a square, horseshoe style bar in the center of the restaurant. These are always the best designed bars. Great for comfort, for conversation and people watching.  One of their walls is full of old cassette tapes. Very cool idea.   The owners of Postino own Windsor. They obviously know a lot about the business, because they did an amazing job with Postinos. And one of the best things about Windsor is it is nothing at all like Postino, yet another amazing job.   I love the healthy menu. Lots of vegitarian choices, and salads.  I have tried the Kale salad, Grain Salad, the Vegitarian Stack.  All great, fresh ingredients.  I also love that they offer some small bar snacks. These are great salty items, that are good to offer people while sitting at the bar.  Another thing I love is they have wine by the glass on tap. This is great for a glass of wine, if your not sharing a bottle. And it helps the environment.   The staff is  very friendly, and well trained. They have remembered me the few times I have been there. Which always makes me feel welcome. Windsor is by far one of my new favorite hot spots in the neighborhood.
