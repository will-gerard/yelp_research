5 stars!!! Luv all their food. Since moving from La, I have missed good Asian food!! The udong and katsu bowl curry is my favorite. Their Korean style dishes does not taste Korean but it's still good. And compared to all the other Asian restaurants in town, this beats them!! Still trying out everything on their menu!! Very good!!! Luv this place!! A little over priced but you do get a lot of food!! And for dessert, you can go next door to the Snoh place!! Yummy!!

ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I gave this place 1 star because the food is truly amazing. Too bad the manager has absolutely no clue what he is doing. Probably gets tipped on the side by "regular" patrons and believes that's where his priorities should be at. First of all I made reservations for my mother's 60th birthday because the food here the first time was great. But did I mention the first time I was here our server made a mistake on every single food item we ordered?? At least he had the decency to get our desserts to make it up. An hour or two before the reservations we had called to see if we could add two more people. They told us fine and moved us up to 9pm for the private dining area. Well we showed up exactly at 9 and our room was not ready. Ok no big deal. A little annoying cuz what's the point of making reservations but we were ok. But after 20-30 min of waiting, I started to get pissed. I told the manager and he actually had the nerve to blame it on me!!!! That I called and added two people last minute!! Isn't it his job to make sure that this doesn't happen?!!! If he couldn't accommodate 8 people then say so and we could have went somewhere else. Also the whole time, he was even apologetic and instead of offering maybe a round of drinks for the wait or anything, he just stood around doing nothing!!! So we left and went to Capital Grille instead. We were very happy to celebrate and spend tons of money where we didn't have to wait and the manager and staff knew what they were doing!!! I will never go here again and if u want to go just expect to wait at least am hour even w reservations!!!!!

I am very happy we found a local Chinese delivery place that is actually good. Ok I'm Asian and I'm from LA so I know good food when I taste it. After reading all the reviews, I decided to pick this place. I got the Kung pao chicken combo. Combo comes w rice, egg rolls and lo mein noodles. It was all very good.y husband got the beef and broccoli entree and it was pretty good. Not as good as Little Peking but this restaurant is closer to us and it delivers!!! The sizzling rice soup was phenomenal!!!!!! I highly recommend this soup and their combo dishes so that you can try different things. Their rangoons were very good too. So overall I will continue to get delivery from this place!!

I go here for brunch a lot. The food is amazing. The decor is very chic and modern. W them renovating an old firehouse is such a cool idea!! I get the egg sandwich, they cook the egg anyway you like so I get it scrambled. Yummy. Also their caramel cinnamon roll is to die for!!! Yes, it's huge, and has tons of calories but so worth it!!! Share it w friends!!! Also I luv their mimosas!! A great place to eat, hang out w friends.

My first ombré experience was the best w Rachel. I have dark brown, pin straight Asian hair. Not only has Rachel done my hair so beautifully, I am currently in the process of going completely blonde. I know Asian girl w blonde? Well Rachel has done a fabulous job. Not orange, or brassy but beautiful blonde with tons of dimensional shades of ash to blonde. I LOVE LOVE my hair. I would not trust my hair at any other place or any other hair stylist! Rachel has so much experience!!! She definitely knows what she is doing!!! Ask for Rachel!!! I highly recommend her!!!!!

Ok I'm extremely picky with my nails but they nailed it!!! Jennifer did my mani and pedi and I could not have been happier. Let me tell you that I have extremely thin and rigid nail and toe beds. It's from me ripping and peeling off the gel polishes. She knew exactly what to do to fix this. She put two layers of the base and couple more coats of the polishes and finished w two more extra coats of the top coat. She also informed me that it's the salon's policy to do two layers of base coat and 3-4 layers of the color. They use high quality polishes and they last!!! Plus the price was amazing!!! I have never been happier!!!

One of my favorite stops!!! The atmosphere is awesome!!! The food is amazing!! We always get the coconut shrimp spring rolls, and the spicy edamame. Very good. And I usually choose from any of the fish. I like that you can pick what you want and how you want it cooked etc. The burgers are amazing if you don't like fish and so is the salads!!

I don't understand why so many people left bad reviews on this place. I work in downtown and this was my first time ordering from here. I was a little hesitant and nervous after reading the reviews but I gave it a shot. W delivery for any amount, I was happy to try. The prices were very reasonable for what you get. I ordered the breakfast wrap w bacon (they serve breakfast all day which is an added bonus)!! It was cut in half, came w salsa and it was absolutely delicious and hearty. I also ordered the chicken shawerma (hot) in pita with a side of macaroni. It was absolutely delicious!!!! This shawerma was also cut in half so that I could easily save for later or even lunch tomorrow. I highly recommend this place!! Give it a try!!!

Their mac and cheese appetizer was to die for! All the cocktails and food was amazing!! Would definitely go again! The salmon was waaaay too salty. at first, I thought the chef had spilled a bottle of salt on it. So I got the sea bass instead. It was much better than the salmon. But the appetizers and salads were all very good. And my husband got the short ribs! Definitely recommend those!!

I love this place. After eating at cherry blossom we walked over to get a dessert. I love their taro milk tea boba. And also their green tea Snoh w mocchi, peach and caramel. It has less calories but not minus the flavor. The concept is very unique and I love this place

I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and I was amazed at how delicious everything was. I got the hog and eggs w bacon. The eggs were lightly fluffed w just the right amount of butter, the bacon was thick cut and they give you hearty portions. The strawberry honey lemonade was absolutely delicious and so was their Rubeun. I would definitely recommend this cute, hipster place!!!

I have been coming here because I absolutely love their funghi pizza. Love the thin crisp crust with arugula and the balsamic dressing that gives it a sweet taste. But I was completely RIPPED OFF on Valentine's Day weekend!!!!!! I purchased a groupon which said 3-course meal for $49 for two people but the groupon didn't state that the appetizer had to be $12 and the entrees for two people had to be $15 each and anything over that price we had to pay for which I was fine w BUT the server gave us the V-day special which my husband got. It was scallops and a filet. The server never told us the price which I now know why! It was a complete rip off!! $60 for two scallops and a filet the size of my palm?!!!!! Seriously?!!! I don't even pay this much at the high end steak restaurants!! Come on!!! Don't rip off locals that have been coming to you!!!! So very disappointed and disgusted w how they ripped us off!!!

The pizza is amazing!!!!! But I especially enjoyed their different assortment of Mac and cheese. You can even get mini portions!! Very coo!! You can choose from jalapeño, truffle, white parm and corn, spicy Korean, and so much more. I tried the white parm and corn and died!!!! I don't even like Mac n cheese!!! But wow!!! Very good!!! I didn't think the Korean dishes tasted Korean but props for trying. Nonetheless everything was delicious!!!!

Rachel is an amazing stylist and colorist and the only person I trust my hair to!!! I was a little hesitant about going ombré with my Asian hair but once she did it, I went back and became a blonde but not that orangey, cheap blonde that you see some Asians get when they go blonde. She made my hair have lots of dimension and depth w warm and golden shades of blonde that matched my skin tone and features. That just says a lot about her skills!! Book an appointment w her and you won't regret it!!!!

Best place for fresh seafood in town!! My husband and I decided to try this place last night and it was amazing!!! We started off with the Harissa shrimp and chorizo skewers. My god.. Talk about fresh jumbo shrimp marinated and grilled to perfection. We loved the shrimp and chorizo skewers. They melt in your mouth. Then we tried the lobster tobanjan roll. There was so much lobster in this roll my tastebuds were in absolute heaven. And my husband who isn't a big fan of seafood due to the fishy taste and smell loved everything so far. There was absolutely no fishy aftertaste because I was told they get fresh seafood delivered every day. I ordered the fresh blue crab cakes as my entree and my husband got the Radio Milano pasta troife which is a shrimp pasta. Both entrees were absolutely delicious!!! The crab cakes were light and crispy with huge portions of fresh crab. I honestly think these were the best crab cakes I have ever ate in Phoenix. Again, no fishy smell or aftertaste which clarifies at how fresh the seafood at this place truly is. I had a bite of my husband's pasta with lots of shrimp in it. It was to die for!!! Everything we had was fabulous and I highly recommend this place!!! And towards the end of our dinner, the manager, Andre, came by to see how everything was and we told him we were definitely coming back!!!
