Was not very good - from the ambiance to the service to the food. Went here with 3 other girls and all of our meals were subpar. The "spaghetti" looked and tasted like chow mein noodles and it was extremely basic. Would definitely not recommend - we spent between $30-$40 for a small plate that any average restaurant could've made better.

They do an amazing job cleaning my car. I always get a full shampoo and upholstery cleaning from them and the car always looks brand new!
