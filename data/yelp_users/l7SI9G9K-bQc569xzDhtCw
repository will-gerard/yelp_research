Drove past this place for yrs and someone told me it was good SO gotta check it out.Good selections great service..Food was hot, tasty, and plentiful. Had the 3 meat skillet with 1/2 bis. gravy...everything was clean and dust free even the bathroom. Told the owner would be back and also invited him to my cafe for a meal sometime..Love to support Local business's. Stop in for sure get a good meal

Love Lou's since it opened...never had ordered the spring rolls..sorry Lou I won't again. 2 rolls cut in half for 7.99 a cheeseburger and fries is 7.79..wow..I will always go back cause the food is good and the drinks are stiff..and the bartenders and waitstaff are excellent..but avoid the spring roll value not there

Well a new experience in customer service. I order a drink and wanted to pay cash.the drink was 5.25 plus tax so 5.73.. I gave a 20 and the waitress brings back 14..??? so I ask about the .27 cents. She said we don't give change..if its less than .50 no change if its over you get 1.00..Really its not about the .27 its the principle..Wow.. Sorry Roger but 2 times bad experience.. I give up

Well all the hype and it was a dud..1st time last time..here it goes the 4 pickles they give were ok .. Jey the server was nice. but wasn't sure if they have yoo-hoo ??wife had a 5 dollar milkshake instead like a 16oz glass that was milk and ice blended with whip cream.yes ice chunks in the shake thumbs down,Vincent Vega would have slapped Buddy Holly for that.. i had 5 town on sour dough with wedges ..wedges were awesome hot crisp and tasty..best part of the meal..got side of watered down ranch ughh ..Sandwich was huge and dove right in tasty but assembled with reckless abandon and where was the avocado NONE..i looked...Jey ask if i wanted a side , uh ya its suppose to be there,he brought out quarter of a sliced avocado..now the 2 budlight drafts i had..glass was not chilled so turned my beer warm. total disappointment..Maybe should have had breakfast.. When we left we looked at deserts and Cream cheese spreads looked good maybe we should have had desert..We will never know cause we wont be back..Oh Jey. we saw yoo-hoo in the to go case for drinks.

Elite has cared for my rental property pool and my home pool for over 5 yrs now. I would not trust anyone else for the service and repair expertise. Careful attention is always given to chemical levels to always keep our pools blue. Prompt repairs and even a loaner cleaner while mine was being repair by the shop.. never a worry...Thanks again

Loved it ..wife and i looking for place to eat as we were going up and down Scottsdale rd lucky she noticed the sign and we turned on thomas and pulled in..was impressed at decor new and nice..Hostess was very helpful in giving suggestions, server was also great. the owner gave us sample of their Caldera Margarita. whoohoo spicy.. we had regular Margs instead..the food was outstanding..chips and salsa to start , bean dip, and a green chile queso. wow..then we shared some apps that were on special for sunday evening..Had and awesome dinner with drinks for less than $50. cant say enough good things..they are new just opened couple months again..we really wish them luck wish was closer to home , but we will be back.. Nice bar and TVs.
