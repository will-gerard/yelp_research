If you're looking for comfort food, this is the place to be. I came here the other night and had a pretty damn good hot dog covered in chili and cheese. The chili was sweet and delicious, and the shakes are tasty.  I got a split (half french fries, half onion rings,) and while the fries were pretty good I just wasn't too crazy about the onion rings. They taste kind of like a bloomin' onion, but something was missing.  My advice would be if you're coming here, don't worry about the sides and indulge yourself in some delicious hot doggy goodness. I'll be back.

This place is simple and delicious.  A true hole-in-the-wall, El Pollo Supremo offers fresh, hot chicken and beef by the quarter-lb. The food is cheap and you get a whole lot of it. You can even see the cooks in the back grilling mounds of tri-tip and loads of chicken from the counter. The sides to pair with your meat and tortillas are plentiful and flavor, and the food here just tastes authentically mesquite.  I do really wish that I could use real utensils here, but unfortunately you only receive plastic. The fact that this place is cash-only is unsurprising, as it seems that all these people really care about is making good food and lots of it. As you can imagine, this place's atmosphere is a bit of an afterthought.  In spite of the negatives, I'll definitely be returning. Anywhere this cheap and tasty is worth going back to.

I love this place.   I've already reviewed the location in Scottsdale, but I've come to love this place even more. Cartel Coffee Lab is a high quality coffee shop with an atmosphere that rivals the coffee they serve. The interior design features bags of coffee beans and industrial-looking containers along the walls, which is totally different from the Scottsdale location and is admittedly much cooler.   The atmosphere is much more focused on the idea of a cartel, which is a welcomed contrast to an otherwise friendly and relaxed vibe. I already can't get enough of this place and it is perfect for students who need a nice place to study and a tasty drink. If you're an avid coffee consumer and you've yet to check out this place, put it at the top of your list. A+

It's sushi.  Living on the ASU campus means that it's hard to find half-decent sushi unless I trek to Scottsdale. This place was pretty close to campus so we decided to try it out. Maybe it's just being from the East Coast, where the fish is a bit fresher, or maybe this place just really isn't anything special.  My friend and I got the special they were offering for the day. A California roll, a shrimp tempura roll, and miso soup to-go for $12. My excitement for my sushi, after reading positive reviews about this place, quickly waned as I failed to taste any difference between this sushi and any sushi around.  Nothing was sub-par, but it didn't exceed expectations either. My tempura roll was excessively salty and lacked flavor. I could hardly discern any flavor of the actual fish itself, and was overall disappointed with this sushi. The miso soup was actually pretty good and flavorful, but I came here in search of tasty sushi, not soup.   I won't say that this restaurant is particularly bad. Yet, I can't help but feel indifferent toward this place. Their bland sushi couldn't give my palate a strong opinion on anything, really. I doubt I'll be back.

My favorite burrito that I've ever had. This place may feel like a hole in the wall but it has plenty of regulars who all love it the same. They recently changed their name from sombrero's to mucha lucha and I love all the changes they've made. For a tiny taco shop it feels warm and authentic.  The food is greasy and beyond delicious. The salsa bar is nice and I particularly enjoy their avocado based sauce. My personal favorite meat is their barbacoa but it's all good.  If you're looking for a top-notch burrito, give this place a try.

Cartel Coffee is an awesome place to hang out and relax. The atmosphere is inviting and modern. The service I received was polite and quick.  For more sophisticated coffee drinkers, Cartel has things like aeropressed coffee, but I personally went with an Americano. My drink was freshly brewed and delicious, without even a hint of bitterness.  I have quickly become a big fan of Cartel Coffee Lab and plan to be a repeat customer.
