The first 'official' weekend with my boyfriend. I fly into CLT and he has a suite booked.. Top floor.. Corner room ... as a surprise to me... :-) Huge room... 2 beds??? Poster beds.. BUT my boyfriend was a bit shocked.. A W T H moment... tells me how perfect this weekend was to be... Dinner at Capitale... partying with friends within my boos industry at EpiCenter... I loved the room.. BUT he wasn't happy. He had booked a king.. got 2 beds... right place ... wrong beds.. Good points... Room was large.. bathroom was seperate of the dressing room... Bad points.. Starbucks closed on weekends???! ... A/C in our room ended up not working so well: we had it set at 60* and we were still hot... OR maybe that was just us:-) By check out time.. we both were sneezing.. BUT location is awesome..AND if you want the 2 bed scene of a romantic weekend... well. Here you go! I still like the Omni.. it's my boo and my place... of 'officiality' :-)

CLT is a cool airport. Lots of eats..free internet...I find it easy in and out.. BUT it's busy. Who'd have thought in NC that an airport would be so busy. CLT has a very strict lightening procedures... they have several ground stops in the summer.. bring your laptop and good reading..

Cheuvront is a perfect date night place. My cute guy set up a reservation for a Thursday night out. We arrived a little early after he realized Cheuvront would close at 2100. We wanted to be sure to he our cheese and wine fix to the maximum. I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasn't a small amount of salmon as one would expect , but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree , but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic. The only two things would change is a later closing ...& not to serve dinner while the cheese course is being savoured. But because the meal and experience of Thursday night date night was so amazing ... Still earns a 5 ...& my date, spot on, is a 10 for making this such a great night :)

A cool place to go for beer and a bite of a hot dog named accordingly the "Big Unit". This place is all about the rocker, Alice Cooper. His face is painted.. all over! Even the bar tenders have his paint on them! His music and the like of metal or rock are playing loudly. It's a cool, happening place to hang before the game. I was impressed to find that they have a pretty big brew selection and even a few gluten free ones for me. That would be a cider for now. But I am learning. The staff was friendly and helpful. We sat at the bar because I like fun places, but my patience of waiting just is not my virtue. My boyfriend got our names on the list and I snuck right in to grab two perfect seats at the bar. I would rather be there anyway, then there is no waiting for adult libations! So the Big Unit arrives.. they ring a bell when you get it. This is serious weiner. No joke. We got it loaded: cheese, chili, queso, comes with jalepenos, onions, all of it on a nice long split bun. The thing is like 20 inches long! I would just say it needed more of the chili and more of the queso. Load it up! Other than that, I loved this place. Good place to pregame, for sure!

A 'dive' bar in the Camelback area? Well. It's actually not that 'divey' . For one. It's really quite a treat. A little gem that is hidden like a dive. I met my love here for a quick happy hour before we headed out for dinner with friends. A pre-game before the real game , if you will. My expectations weren't that high, but that is okay. My boyfriend loves a good divey bar that is not so trendy and yuppie, as he puts it. This to me was just nice and surprising. The bar staff was super friendly. The beer on tap was nice and cold. Peach Ale from 4Peaks is always a win-win for me! 4Peaks Kiltlifter on tap for him. Off track betting on the tele. Pool tables around the place. For 345pm in the afternoon, it was already packed! We didn't want to mess our appetites up, so we only opted for the fried pickles and went half regular and half cajun spicy. YUMMY! Besides, on happy hour they are $3.50; one of the best happy hour menu pricings around and that is important! I loved being happy when I think I may end up turning my nose up at something.. Just goes to show: Listen to Yelp!

I may have found a new fav with good New Mexican food..but with a bit of flair.. and a bit of class.... Its a cool, bit of a homey feel with flair... and a country home feel.. LOVE the bar downstairs...  Small plates is a big thing in DC, where I lived for a bit, so I am always excited when I see it on a menu anywhere here... and done right.. Not just some hummus or dip tossed on a plate and one calls it a 'tapas':-) I didnt have any of the small plates tonight... I was full truly from the pre dinner events.. BUT had to have the pork enchiladas.. and everyone else had the adovada... Mine was awesome, but I had order envy, bc I tasted theirs and it was a firey delight... wanted it and couldnt steal and get away with it... not in this crowd, at least. The waiter was pleasant.. He didnt really know how to pair the wine with the carne adovada... but suggested a couple and brought samples.. cool beans.. Euro style, as it should be done before you buy a bottle. Be warned...the chile is HOT... and if you order..it is yours... warning on menu.. Score one for this restaurant... I love it..

I really loved my last dining night at Giuseppe's. It's a small little restaurant in a strip mall but don't let that deter you , it's big on flavor and uniqueness in its pasta dishes.   My boyfriend and I dined here with his company recently. We sampled the bruschettas, which are featured on a chalkboard, and the rice balls, which we shared because they are rich and ample. I had half of one and it was enough.  For dinner, I ordered the Pasta al Limoncello, made with house made linguine noodles, prosciutto and a creamy sauce popped with a burst of Limoncello. I've just traveled to Italy and fell in love with the taste of Limoncello .. So I was interested to taste how this came together. Rich and amazing! I took half of my entree home. The Squid Ink Pasta with clams was ordered at our table, as well. Perfecto! So different!   To me the portions were just enough for dinner and a little to take home. The bruschettas were ample servings as are the salads, which two could easily share.   The Key Lime Pie is delicate and housemade, as well. I highly recommend! It's not a tart, tart taste like some key lime pies, it's just enough.   The place filled up by 630pm. Including the patio.  The only thing I would change is the bread. A good Italian restaurant needs good, hot Tuscan bread and oils and butter served. The rest...is mmmmmmmm :)

Well Merc. You have let me and my friends down. I have gone to you over the years while living in the Biltmore/Arcadia area and  have recommended you time and time again to people who want a 'ultra lounge feel' as opposed to a 'club like feel'. Well. After arriving for happy hour last week we had the entire Merc Bar to ourselves at about 430pm and the bartender swiftly brought us a menu and waters. Nice! However, that awesome service went downhill fast and the decibel level of your 90's Culture Club and New Edition beats went way up at the same rate. Soon my two friends and I were yelling our conversation to each other! ' What?!! What?!!! OH right?!! ' Yes. I am not making this up. That music was loud & out of character for what I 'thought ' was a cool, swanky, hip, ittle ultra lounge. I'm thinking some jazz, maybe ?? Or at least some Michael Buble? At a level where your patrons can talk in a voice to each other that doesn't cause laryngitis the next day! We would eventually figure out as Merc began to fill up , that there was a group meeting here this particular day. There were so many, in fact, we could not make our way to the restroom without pushing thru physically. We never saw the cocktail waitress, and that meant we never got our waters refilled after that bartender brought us our initial glass. At any rate , our drink that our once attentive bartender gave us was called the Double A. It was a mix of tequila , grapefruit juice , raspberries , lemon and bitters. It was good! I won't deny that you have amazing fresh ingredient drinks made with premium liquors! That said, we would have stayed and ordered more , but the cocktail waitress had to be flagged down by going to the bar  , ( and fighting the Meet Up crowd again), and telling the bartender we wanted our bill. She came twenty minutes later and we were overcharged for our drinks. Fail. We went back to bartender again because she kept our valet and garage tickets! We felt that trying to 'fight' over a few bucks wasn't worth the effort of the crowd, the loud music and all of the frustration. Oh. MY. I give you a two based on your drink being unique and fresh and that is all. What you used to be, Merc Bar, I hope you can be again!

Feeling kind of ill, one of my Scottsdale besties swings over to get me out of my funk for a what...a piece of sweet??? UMMM ... I dont do sweets...and I usually do no chains... but.. because my uppity bestie was in the ying for a slice of cheesecake in my neck of the woods.. we went for the factory of all things...cheesecake. Seriously, Ive been to a Cheesecake Factory for birthday parties... or in malls. But I had to rate this place, bc the waiter was off the charts one of the best I have ever, yep! ever had... I told him I didnt have much of an appetite, as I mulled the book of a menu over and over and kept sending him away and my 'wanting only dessert friend' now wanted some orange chicken too... and bread...and a side salad.. geesh.. how can a 90lb girl want so much food? ... I ended up with a chicken sandwiche and soup... none of which was earth shattering... but I loved the waiter... we had fun with the fact that the seemingly 'we never get out much' peeps next to us didnt know how to act in a restaurant...and he brought us a piece of decadent red velvet cheese cake and even wrote in cursive a cute little note for me and my friend.. and I will leave it at that:-) Score for the factory.. compliments of the waiter... Now if they can find a way to control the other diners and the out of control kids.. they may be on to something.

I really love this Capital Grille! This location at Biltmore has always been spot on. Made a reservation for our anniversary here the night before Valentines Day. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our car service was met with awesome valet guys. We sat at the bar and had pre-dinner cocktails. I've always been treated so well at this particular Capital Grille from valet to valet. I love that when your table is ready they take your tab and your drink for you to your table. This night was our anniversary of a year and our table had rose petals scattered all over it. How nice is that?! We started with a seafood tower. It's our one year and hey, relationships these days that last, deserve pomp and treats! Well.. We like bubbles and food! This seafood tower was divine and we aren't large people; as soon as it arrived, I knew we were in over our heads! Oh well, you only live once .. Spend well! Next we both ordered the filet mignons. My go to steak. I know they do it right and perfect it was this night. We opted for the mashed potatoes and a salad, as well. I think we both had two bites and were stuffed! Our waiter was spot on perfect. So friendly, you can see why Capital Grille is one of the top notch steak houses. He suggested the perfect merlot to pair our filet with and even brought us a complimentary vodka Stoli vanilla cream cordial after dinner drink, just because! As if we weren't stuffed enough and had not been spoiled by the staff enough on our special night, out comes a dessert tray with a chocolate cursive writing of, ' Happy Anniversary!', around several small dessert samplings. So wonderful! I love a classy restaurant like this that loves it's customers and shows it this way. It's a splurge and it's worth it, every single time! Oh.. We even got two little truffles in a cute little Capital Grille box to take home :-)

This is a cool place to get your hot hava on... I like it.. take away to a different locale and it may just take me back to when I flew for a really, really good airline out of Seattle! Oh yeah... get back to the now... ugh..so Hava Java.. was craving a strong Americano.. but at the last moment.. I switched gear into an italian soda... its made how it should be.. minus a ton of sugar! It freshens the pallet. and a bit of sweet... I cant give a true 5 bc I didnt do the Java... but the barista... hes super friendly... knows his java... and multi tasks well... Since its my hood... Ill go back in the cooler weather for my espresso.

This Saks store is one of the 'prettier' ones.. Love the makeup section.. the shoe departments... I go here for my Rock & Republics...I just like the setup better .. easy to find your size, in other words... I do not like the sales staff in that department though... Ive had a couple of experiences and they could use a bit of know how in the personalizing and customer service department... But I think for the most part...Saks rates high on the mark.

I heart all that Saks has. They ALWAYS have my jeans be it Hudsons, Joe's, 7's or Michael Stars. They always have my makeup of Chanel, Clarins or Dior. WELL, now they have my new favorite parfum, Jo Malone. NOT only that, they have a 'parfum' table set just for JMalone and so many, SO many good choices. Ha! Even I learned there is more than one JMalone. I can't deny loving the fact that my new fav smell is unisex and not too girly. AND hard to find. Since this is about Saks and not JMalone. I will get back to the review at hand! Saks 5th always has what you need and yep, it probably comes with a price tag. Premium brands usually do and as I was brought up, you get what you pay for. The staff here at Saks, well, I would make them all smile every second and not bug in certain areas, such as parfums and makeup. Yet have them at least approach you all happy, glorious and bounding with energy in others. But let's face it. The service industry in a shaky economy does not come with that. Go to Saks knowing you get what you want usually in terms of Chanel, S Weitzmann, premium brands.  As Coco Chanel quoted, " The best things in life are free; The second best are very expensive".

I love Dr. Milana and all of his staff. They are all professional; personable and make you feel comfortable ... well.. as comfortable as your gonna get or be ..HELLO! This is a dentist. WHO really says, 'Gee I can't wait to get drilled in the mouth!'... yeah. No. I even had a little coupon for a whitening kit for my first cleaning and xray visit. Love that. I am all about having whitey whites. After you run out of whitener, it's about $10 to fill the syringes for more whitener. I have nothing bad to say about the office or the staff at Arcadia Dentistry. They all take their time with you , the patient and never rush through what can be a stressful process.

Looking for a quick fix to a taco craving my friend & I had.. We venture a few miles away from my loft to go get our fix fixed..  Umm ...  I don't think so... Chips & salsa? More like a styro to-go box filled w unsalted chips & pico de gallo over the chips?! Who does that?! Taco.. 2stars.... I always get a chicken taco, if I can get the meat in shredded form.. I'm weird about my meat! But this is more like ground chicken..& they placed it in the styro to go box next to the cheese enchilada I ordered to go with..so the taco became a part of the smothered enchilada mess.... Yep... Drowned in lukewarm red enchilada sauce... That enchilada... I couldn't finish... The cheese was not melted inside.  Ok.. Should I have complained..(as a very advising yelper once scolded me for).. Probably! But in truth.. The girl behind the counter had rubbed me wrong already... By telling me I looked 'tire'... & secondly by having a host issue with her credit card machine... Asking me to pay cash... Whatever.  I'm harsh? Possibly... 2stars... & that's a compliment.

The Bruschetta here rocks! Hands down..Ive never had anything like it.. ALL of the bruschettas are great .. my least fav is the Tuscan bean.. Im just not a fan.. The Fig & Mascarpone is more of a 'dessert' than a app...:-) I havent had a bad wine there yet, either. Postino is  always trendy and fun... great date place... :-) Always crowded...

Postino is still a 5 with me.. Seriously, I havent found anything I love as much in the Valley... Best happy hour for the winos... AND everytime I intro the place to someone.. They love it ! Last Friday I took my fav there.. Hes new to my wine world.. I can't have a friend who doesn't know wine!!! SO this is the place to introduce it to him.. I cant say how friendly I think the staff is.. We stood for quite awhile.. (GUESS the word is out on the bomb Post!).. but the bartender kept checking on us.. the hostess was awesome.. LOVE the bruschettas to this day.. I actually crave them! I love that Postino changes the wine menu... and frequently, by golly!  I heart the Postino with the mostest!

Still a 5... Still my fav wine bar , date place.. Or place to hang, get good vinos & gossip... Cheap valet.. But if u snag a LGO place, I think.. Free. Bruschetta.. Not any, any other wine bar.. Can compare.. Yummy sweets..& staff is amazingly nice.. Even though this place is always standing room only..

Always my 'go to' wine bar to hang with my girls.. :-) AND I am in love with the Sangria Sundays there.. We go early to secure our choice table.. under a mister.. in the patio section of where WE want to be.. looking swag! Gettin our Sangria on.. and our bruschetta.. We know the whole thing by heart.. NOW the last time we were there.. We did send a salad back.. NO question from the cutie serving it. He took it.. and said he was sorry.. brought a little extra bruschetta.. and BAM. NOW looka there.. I kept the 5star on the yelp! Actually, it would be hard for Postino to lose that with me, because I have been coming here since I moved to the PHX and no other wine bar compares. I heart all things Postino..   MY only wish.. Sangrias all week!

I'm such a fan of my Postino! I am addicted to the bruschetta! I start craving it after a few weeks of not having it! In fact, I will go bread free and NOT have any bread .. SO I can load up on bruschetta when I come here. This place is packed.. No matter when you come here. I want to say get here 'early' , but truly.. there is no 'early' at Postino. Just get here! Get your name on the list and get your belly near the bar and get your drinks ordered. I usually never change things up too much. I love red wines and that is what I go with .. always. I like the $5 wines until 5pm. After that, if this is where my group is hanging , we generally go with the bottle then. The bottles are priced at 3x the amount of the glass price. Not bad and not hard to figure out. The meat board is great .. the cheese board is divine. All bruschettas ...mmmmmm. I've never done any desserts here. Maybe I should . But I usually am not a dessert girl. So I use my calories on wine, bread and cheese! I only brought my star down one as the last time I was here our waiter was to split the bill with me and my flight attendant friend from NYC. Instead, not only did he split it, he split and added the full cost to my card too! It took about 5 business days to correct! I'm still a fan, though. Catering: I catered a small gathering at my place with bruschettas and paninis . Perfect and on time. You pay as you order.

Postino will forever be my favorite wine bar outside of California , I am 100% convinced of this fact. Having lived in the PHX area permanently now for a few years, I can honestly say that Postino has set the standard on the bruschetta bar.. and it is high very hard to find one that compares! I have not found any other place that even comes close on the bruschetta variety and taste scale . For $14 you can get four different bruschettas that are generous and on the perfectly, freshly baked bread.. not soggy and not too crisp! I actually don't have a favorite one and I like that Postino has a seasonal bruschetta now that changes from the usual. It's always fun as a group to order all of the bruschettas amongst a few boards and sample them all! The cheese board is always good; the salads you can't go wrong with , either. Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm, bring your date or your friends and $20 gets you bruschetta and a bottle of vino! Or how about brunch for $5 mimosas or sangria on the weekend ? I've also ordered catering from Postino and they always get it correct! Sometimes I just NEED that amazing bruschetta variety in my home for entertaining ! This is always my favorite place for a date night with my new hubby. I introduced him to wine, ( okay not really!!)  and thus, Postino Arcadia being in my old pre-marital hood, we cultivated some of our 3 years together right here in Arcadia at this very Postino.. and if wine isn't your thing, don't worry, they have a great selection of brews! After wine there are lovely, yummy desserts or for brunch , Postino offers cappuccinos and lattes. The patio is dog friendly and the ambience is all lit dimly with candlelight and hip beats for your sipping. Since this is about my 9000th review for Postino, I think it's safe to say, I rate it on the highest PHENOM level!

So my good friend, the pilot calls and says, "Kimberly, can your yuppy ass hang at a dive bar?" and Im like, " Bring all the dive you got baby...", of course, hes about as preppie as they come... and we end up at JT's... OSU banners adorn the place... its long and narrow.. and we got the once or twice over as we walked in... the bar tender, Rebecca was sweet and informative... The place is simple... and cheap... and packed... The wings seemed to be the thing... and Im wishing I had a taste for them... just never have been a fan. But they looked good... My friend had a burger... it was piled high with mushrooms.. I had a grilled chicken sandwiche...basic, but I needed food if I was drinking with a pilot, after all... 2 Guiness, 4 Harp, 2 shots and 2 burgers... and the bill was about $45, thats a pretty good thing...

Im gonna give this fresh cut boutique a cute little 5 stars...as well as the cutie who gave me the bunch from here... Ive never actually purchased anything from here... but he did... and he scored a bunch with me too..( just a bit of a shame that he lives in the east.). nonetheless.. the flowers were beautiful..fresh and tightly all done up.. in an unusual way...and that is what scores with most of us.. uniqueness...:-) I had never heard of this place.. and now I have.. good to know that romance truly does exist..as well as creativity:-)

Ever since sponsoring a Thai officer many years ago in another life I lived in another place.. I havent really ying yanged for the Thai til recently.. I had visions of his fish eye lime ridden soup in my head for years.. bless his hard working, soul.. It did me my hard to please self in on the Thai food for at least 10 years... The soup here is awesome.. I could have made a meal of it.. It comes in a authentic pot , all lit and hot! I had the Pad Thai.. keeping it real and keeping it simple Thai for this first time back to the Thai after all these years.. Im a new fan.. I love it.. cant wait to go back and get more adventurous.. JUST no fish eye soup.. never ever again! More hot pot soup tho ... Any day!

Aunt Chilada.. You bad señorita.. Here's your grade.. No bueno.. You get an F.. I drove all the way from my hood to go & visit you across town.. You treated me like a step niece that you hated !  Drink order took forever.. & was wrong.. No H2o.. Despite 3 , yes 3requests.. Order was wrong., took a bazillion million minutes to get.. And the waitress was not a happy girl.. Nope, Aunt Chilada she was not.. And your chips were stale too.. The cheese on top the taco came when of all things I finally get to pay my debt to you for bad service and nibbles.. And then she forgot the credit card.. What the heck, Tia.. Was she getting her nibbles & snack on across the way with my card.. ?? Well.. Sorry , but you let me down..& it'll be a long time before I visit your casa again...

Ive been going here for almost 2 years.. I love what they do and I hate their attitudes. What a dilemma. I shouldnt have to pay to be b#$C*(# at! The owner gets me every time I come in.. and for a minute, I thought it was friendly bantering. I go here to get schlacking.. A mani with gel that lasts for at least 3 weeks. My nails take a beating on my job and who has time to pamper the nails all the time? SO now Im looking for a new place.. She charged my friend $5 less for the exact same services and because I came back at her about her mouth and attitude.. with a smile, of course.. she didnt say thank you for the generous , yet not real deserved, tip. They are also selling prom dresses (one for $250!) and knock off bags with high prices.. that cheapens the place, in my opinion. Stick to nails and wax, and thread.. and work on that attitude. :-)

If I could give a 0 star, they'd own it.. I have nothing.. Not one positive to say about this bank. I wanted a local bank because most of my money is in USAA which used to be hard to make deposits to because they are based in San Antonio. BofA has fees upon fees.. Long lines at any lunch hour... Waits on phone , awful customer service.. Oh and the kicker.. I deposited a trust fund check.. From Vanguard!! They wouldn't let me have it for 10-14 days.. Despite that Vanguard had cleared the check with them.. I'm guaranteeing BofA made interest off of my $7k! Don't get me started on what they have done to our housing market.. Ahh.. Thank God I can bank with USAA..

SO I love me some 'Bertos' anything since Ive moved into the valley... all the Bertos confuse me.. is it Filibertos? Because Im confused.. well, maybe its a blonde thing I just dont get.. BUT this aint NO Filibertos, yo..  I went to EriBertos this morning.. as I have a few times before since moving to North Phoenix.. First.. S L O W.. secondly, can we say H A I R in my food.. ugh! Nothing worse.. okay.. stomach is turned.. and money is wasted.. I guess I didnt need huevos rancheros anyway.. but when that kind of negligence takes place.. it doesnt deserve even a one star.. boo Bertos!

Being from Cali.. I love a great gourmet grocery ... I cant express how my heart flutters at the smell of a great cheese department.. not for the Cali in me but for the Parisian in me.. ahhhh! Bon Fromagerie!! I wont say this AJ's gets me going like the Aj's in other areas of PHX.. but still thats just pure out being high maintenance and picky picky.. Im happy to have this gem in the desert.. I love the wine department.. the cheeses.. the gourmet of it all.. oh yeah.. and the desserts:-) mmmmm a pure piece of heaven.. if Im feeling decadent that day.. and when running late for a party.. you can always know that AJ's will have a quick run in and grab plant or beauty of bouquet .. :-)

Still where I generally go about once a week for a good wine.. a great steak.. and the hard to find gourmet.. I just feel good at Aj's... maybe because it reminds me of all the gourmet shops of home.. LOVE Aj's

After a ASU beat my Dad's once USC at home in the worst stadium ever, mind you..  My very happy ASU friends ordered up a Chicago style pizza from Spinatos.. THIS pizza rocks the valley; enuf said. It has a perfect crust texture.. and just the right amount of toppings & every week since then, I just crave it. Too bad I don't live closer. Oh well. That in itself probably keeps me thin! When I am with my friends out in N Phoenix watching games, this is the go-to pizza place!  Get your sauce for the side... and yum!

Today I took my new little pup  to his first puppy check up.. and shots.. I was nervous.. he was nervous.. I pop him in my Beemer .. and he plops his nervous puppy self down on my friends business shirts that he's asked me to drop at the cleaners.. (oops forgot about that).. and away we go.. the staff at Desert Hills is super nice.. super informative.. and Dr. Sellers is great.. hes gentle.. knowledgable and gave the pup his shot in a way that he didnt even know.. a bit of puppy treat.. and we were back in the Beemer and away to drop those shirts..before I forget again.

I dont know why ... the cleaners, I just dont like going.. yet its one of those on the 'needs vs wants' list of lifes little duties.. But recently my friend begs me to drop his cleaning and when I agreed , he hands off like a bazillion shirts he needs by Friday. He needs medium starch and laundered crisp... WOW! I thought I was high maintenance.. He refused to let me pop them into my cleaners near Biltmore.. Okay.. I love this place.. they are nice.. friendly and swift.. Best thing yet.. NOT having to leave your car to get your cleaning on the day of pick up.. theres a drive thru..swift again.. Reminds me of DC! I love it.. running to Biltmore to collect my cleaning now..NM! That's a long drive for cleaning !

Awesome workout clothing section. Even for the cold weather types, they had a fair amount of Columbia & North Face wear. BUT, after asking about a weight bench that was displayed practically on the ceiling, whether it gave a flat recline or a angle, and no one could tell us...HMMMM.. the girl reluctantly acted like shed go get some help when we pressed to see the box, please? maybe? She left and 15 minutes later no one came! Another worker walked past and asked us how he could help, we explained about the bench. He cockily stated that no bench would recline flat...HMMM... my friend  pointed out the option on the ground and said , 'that one does'..the worker chuckled..'okay'. I may have purchased an elliptical too, since my running days post knee surgery may have come to a close, but I was  so aggravated on how no one knew the product or had the schbang to figure it out for a sale, we left and headed over across PV to Camelback SA. Epic, Fail.

I have to like this place.. this is where my upgraded wedding anniversary band was bought.. well, it was put together.. because the story Im told by my very creative husband , is that he wanted a particular cut diamonds with high clarity..+VS or above... and a particular setting with channel diamonds.. This anniversary band was a huge surprise when my husband was out in AZ on business at Luke AFB... AND it was huge on my finger.. Jared has an onsite inspector who could tell me if bringing my ring down 2 , almost 3 sizes would mess up the diamonds in the sides..  My one downside.. appraisers are not onsite and only there certain times of the month.. OH make that a two downsides..I was to pick up my anniversary ring after the sizing at a particular time.. I called to see if I could get it 40 minutes earlier..Just being impatient and antsy and had to get to Scottsdale.. NO call back.. Even though the receptionist said it should be ready and theyd call back.. Most annoying thing is when someone says they are going to return a call.. and they blow it off.. That's a small thing and my husband didn't get to see the finished gift on my finger before his next trip back to DC and then on to Tokyo, but oh well.  All and all .. I love Jared:-) High quality diamonds and beautiful platinum look amazing on my finger with my original wedding rings.

Going to any Aveda store for your supply of Shampure isnt just a shopping experience..its a TOTAL experience.. your greeted with a healthy, smiling staff member.. your offered mint tea... you get a free massage.. YES.. I could fall asleep.. You choose your aromatherapy based on what your nose likes.. and the knowlegable member will work with your skin and hair to get your product correct.. This is no in and out experience..Im sure if you just advised that you need it fast.. and knew what you wanted... they would happily oblige.. BUT just take a moment.. and smell the aromatherapy for olfactory sakes..

Loved the staff here. I went in with a migraine.. the worst migraine. In fact, a scary, cant feel your face and slurring your words like a drunk with no drink, migraine. I was ushered right in. (Probably because they thought I was young but having a stroke..!).. The Er is noisy and daunting like any other trauma room, with ambulances bringing in broken bones,etc. My only scary moment was being given a shot of morphine, which I failed to mention, I am allergic to..! AS the nurse was leaving.. I freaked out with a reaction.. a shot of benadryl and a few other choice drugs.. and I felt no more of that. Its clean and everyone is friendly and on their game. Glad I left..

I am always amazed when I find a great..NO! ... An AMAZING steakhouse ! The Stockyards has a rich history and that makes it even more special. Upon arriving at Stockyards, I am a little taken aback about where it is. Here's the deal though, this place started in 1919 as a packing house and eventually grew to a huge feedlot with more than 40,000 head of cattle.  In 1947, the Stockyards Restaurant opened on the feedlots property and was THE place for cattle baron, politicians and bankers to meet. With beef 'homegrown' , fed and plated right on property, the Stockyards Restaurant was THE original Arizona steakhouse. Much of the glory of the cattle days has since gone, but the history in the building still exists.  The bar was bustling and a standing room only when I arrived on a Wednesday night to meet up with a few other people. There are ample premium liquors and an extensive wine list to be enjoyed. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and given an overview of the restaurants history by our great waitress. A small silver terrine of fresh veggies are left for pre-dining munching. Reminds me of old school parental type restaurants. Love that!  Many of the steaks are cut on order and are aged on property. They even have Chateaubriand for two!  I had a 5 oz. filet and it was like slicing warm butter. So thick and amazing flavor! I highly recommend the Parmesan Potato Gratin Stack to go with your choice of meat. I started with the very ample Green Goddess salad and that can be split. Our waitress paired a wonderful Cabernet with my filet; ON her game! For dessert, we all ordered many things and sampled each other's. I personally loved the Burnt Creme .. Rich like a brûlée , yet with enough of a citrus finish to not be too, TOO sweet. I paired that with a Frangelico on the rocks and I left, NOT finishing any of one thing I ordered ! I was stuffed! No worries , it was nicely boxed up for the next day :)  I did not find this steakhouse to be pretentious, as some can be, or snooty. People dressed from casual to dressy and no one batted an eye at that. You will need a reservation. The Stockyards was busy from the time I arrived just after 6pm to almost 10pm , when I left.  This is a great steakhouse with amazing food and history and service to go along with great prices for hand cut and seasoned/aged steaks and meats. A awesome dinner for about $50-80 p person with wine .. Best thing, is , it's local!

Mark , Mark hes my man.. if he cant fix it no one can! My crew luggage goes to Mark.. and he fixes it timely and every time.. My luggage is flight crew luggage.. takes a beating.. he knows Travel Pro.. and how to get my warranty.. how to get my inflight supervisor to approve a new one..or not! AND even finds things that I didnt know were in there.. umm thats embarrassing! Seriously... I know this is cheesy... But drive a bit and get in the hood, Mark rocks and if you pay a bit more for his expertise, isnt it just worth it?

Driving along Baseline and there is this little gem on a cold winter day. I see red pepper rhistras and I must stop! I have been on a mission to adorn my home in something red and southwestern since being home and not in the skies this year to celebrate the season. I see small ones, medium ones, LARGE red peppers dried and hanging brightly from Summers Fruit Barn! Who knew a girl from California who spends her days and nights in the clouds could get so excited over hanging red peppers?! Well. I can. I scrambled in and was made a 'deal'! I wanted two small for my carriage lights outside my garage and one red pepper wreath for my door! These rhistras are pretty pricy, if you can find them in various sizes like this, anywhere else. I got all three for a bargain! Since I was there, I walked around and was amazed at the fresh fruits, nuts, honey, jams and jellies, pickled things here and there! I ended up buying a lot more than just the red peppers! They had samples of citrus and a grapefruit known as 'blanca' that I had not ever tasted. This reminded me of growing up in a rural area where you get to sample the fruit before you buy! I love it! The staff is helpful, fun, friendly and these kind of little gems just don't exist that much anymore. One tip, pay cash and save the credit/debit card usage fee of a dollar.

This has to be some of the worst food in all of Phoenix. I've been here twice and I love the bartender who gave us the history of some of the tequilas and even let us sample some. He deserves a 5 star for his patience to work here; his margaritas are huge and very good too. The bar music is funk from the 70's and 80's though, that could be updated. The dining experience, is a big, giant fail. The place is disorganized from room to room and crowded. The last time, I swear our waitress hated us or her job or maybe just her life? My daughter asked a simple question about the heat of the chiles and she snapped at her with , 'sometimes they are hot and sometimes they aren't ; you get what you get. You want it or not?' We took a little longer to mull it over and she huffed and walked off. She returned about 10 minutes later to ask if we were 'ready to order this time?' When our order finally arrived, mine was wrong and I told her so; here comes that huff again and she stormed off again, when she returned she slammed the meal down and never checked on us after that. Needless to say my return factor is not even a 5%. It's Phoenix and there are about 150 other great Mexican places where the service, food, salsa and Margs are outstanding. Poor nice bartender.

I used to love this chain of a place when I lived in this neck of PHX.. that was then.. and this is now.. I have fallen out of love with you Mimis.. You simply let me down.. In need of a little soup on my day over in the Tukee.. I decided out of everything close to my Dr. that day.. I could go to Mimi's ...reliable, comfort food.. Well, rude and lack of customer service met us at the door.. My friend had a salad.. she tried to send it back.. it was soggy.. and the chicken was 'weird tasting', she said.. She is newly pregnant.. so it was enough to just ruin her meal.. We waited and waited.. waited and waited.. I finally flailed my arms about to get A WAITERS attention.. itd been that long! He did apologize.. he offered her something new.. but we had an appointment.. (yeah.. since you waited 20 min to return to our table yet asked all the tables around us how they were liking their meals!).. and we needed to go.. I will say my soup was good.. not worth 3 or higher good.. but okay.. how about 2 for okay.. and 0 for all else.. Im not sure Mimi is my girl anymore:-=(

Fab happy hour.... make dinner out of it! 4 rolls , 2 salads & a lobster wonton app with a divine sauce to go with... all about $40... including a couple drinks..  Yellow tail roll was my least fav.. just had a weird taste.. and I cant do sushi with a taste that isnt fresh... umm sorry not worth it.. but everything else was right on...so I didnt send back...  Waiter kind of complacent.. I hate my salads to come seconds before my other choices..  Decor I adore!

Im nooooo fan of the dental arts..but you have to do what you have to do, sometimes..you know? Get your pearlies clean.. THANK god I have good genes and teeth... okay maybe, good teeth... but you get me, I know! Dr. Ito is wonderful...he liked my car..& kept talking about it...I had to laugh, bc I kept thinking how did he know what I drove...but heres the thing...a good Dr. will direct your attention elsewhere if your fearful..and Im a nervous wreck at the dentist office. He jokes and makes the experience personal.. The assistants and hygenist are wonderful... they have headphones and little tv's attached to your dental chair to watch ..and for me...I just need something to take the chisel sound away... or the suction..I dont like chisels or suction noises in my mouth! I get my teeth whitened here too... I drive out of my way to get over there to go to Dr. Ito & his staff...

IF I could give this bank a zero star.. It would get it.. as of today, Im no longer a client.. Im placing my hard earned, low yielding funds with USAA.. where I have been happy for over 15 years.. STUPID me for thinking that when I took a job locally here with a locally based airline that I should also have a local based bank.. WRONG.. and FAIL.. the story begins when on a layover last year someone used my debit/credit card to order over $900 worth of creatine and muscle producing products.. THAT wouldnt be me! Because IM a 5'2 , 120 lb girl.. I dont need nor do I want any bs like that.. Does my bank believe me.. GUESS not! NO.. THEY want me to do the leg work and call the company in question.. bc I HAD a layover in said city in the past 30 days and it was 'questionable' as the rude customer service person at BOFA stated.... WOW.. way to go.. over and over I saw the same $900 go into and out of my acct over the past 9 mths.. silly me.. I will say that most of the money has gone back into my acct. BUT not without alot of headache by me.. and I am the innocent party here.. I simply detest this bank.. AND as a person who was frauded.. all of this was uncalled for.. I dont recommend this bank to anyone..

I have loved J Crew forever .. FOREVAHHHHH... And this store gets my 4 for being friendly.. last year I bought a little black dress for the Nascar Champions event in the NYC..I saw it in the window and no size 4 to be had.. The sales girl said shed have it in less than 24.. to my home, no less.. Ive been a fan of this particular J Crew ever since.. But for me, Id be hard pressed to NOT like something J Crew--ish... I love the cardigans.. the little dresses.. the umbrellas.. (better in use on the East than in the West).. and I have a thing for the headbands.. for my long locks.. every winter they come out with J Crew jammies.. stock up.. I like this store better than the one in Fashion Square.. they are just nicer:-)

I'm a foodie & I love to cook, so of course, I love places like this. All kinds of gadgets and cool culinary items. What I love is that most of the stuff here is quality and for the true culinary wanna be or is/been. My favorite wine opener came from here as did my favorite Le Creuset pot. The girl the last time I was there and admittedly, dove in the store knowing it was about to close, was so sweet. I apologized for my tardiness but needed a last minute gift and she said it was fine because she had stuff to do anyway. I was testing out the Nespresso machine and she even made me an espresso to try and schooled me on it's efficiency. Wow. No rude clerks here and since I love this store .. That's a 5:-)

Quite possibly my favorite Pottery Barn in the valley. First, it's easy in, and easy out. You can park fairly close and NOT have to trek all thru the mall, when what you really came for is right there in the PB store! I live in the Biltmore area and instead of going to closer PB stores, I make the drive over to Chandler to go to this one. The staff is friendly and helpful. I purchased a floor sample wing chair for my sitting room, for example, and they loaded it into my little German trunk and wrapped it in plastic, roped it and even told me a good cleaner that would come to my home and take off the 'floor dust' . How could I resist? It was the perfect cozy chair at more than 2/3 off the original price! IF there is something in the catalog that you see and want, they will order and have it sent to your home and once even to my place in DC! I even got a 'new homeowners' 20% discount to go with! I'm always a fan of PB...and I love the sale section!

Decided at the last minute to book a room for the weekend in Scottsdale for the weekend birthday celebratory of a great friend. Since we have points with Hilton, this resort was a no-brainer. It's close to Old Town; cool restaurants; Fleming's Steakhouse is attached and that is always a win-win; there's a nice gym; infused water; nice decor and on-the-spot room service. The pool could be larger and it's filled with children; a renovation to that would be a plus, give them their space and the adults their own, too. But, lots of shade and umbrellas, even on a 112* day. The pool bar is hit and miss. The first guy, Alex, is amazing. He was alone running the pool bar and serving the pool guests at their loungers; very nice, attentive and eager to please. The next guy, complete polar opposite! David could learn from Alex! David doesn't do friendly! In fact, David is down right rude. I would say renovate the pool & add some cabanas for rent; another pool bar or at least some help for Alex , ( but not David :) ) ; and add some more options on the late night room service menu which goes : desserts; coffees/teas/alcohols; kids menu . But, it's still a solid 4 star for me because all else was done so well. From valet to check in, to breakfast delivery to dinner to concierge services . Good job Hilton

Having a ying for a taste of Switzerland.. I decide to celebrate a special persons birthday here.. Kind of to remind her of Europe.. well.. the price reminded me of Switzerland.. but the authenticity isnt there.. AND they have a menu that says a Alpine Nite.. dont be fooled.. most cheese fondues do not have grainy mustard in them.. We did the price fix menu.. starting with the cheese fondue.. a salad.. the meat and seafood course.. (a small amount for two considering the price was about $45 each).. chocolate fondue.. with too much amaretto in the chocolate.. the experience is cool.. but if youve been to Switzerland.. dont go in here thinking your getting authentic.. my advice.. hit up Sur La Table and get your own fondue pot.. do it at home.. and youll get more authentic.. am I snob.. proudly..

I love this place! Keep in mind this is a academy... You know? Students needing practice perfecting a cut, a color, a wax.. Get to use you to PRACTICE:-) I think it's great... For them.. For the public , whom In times of a tough economy can save a few $$ and still get an Aveda experience..my advice , be patient... Did you perfect your job when you were new and learning with warp speed?? ... Have faith.. Cmon!! They aren't fresh out of nursery school students on the loose with sharp shears & sharpie pens!.. They have instructors checking on their work..& correcting , if need be. ... And when in doubt... ASK.. Yes! If you don't like what you see.. Ask for help:-) not brain science .. But a place for a great Aveda experience.. At a fraction of the cost.. If you want your 5-star $500 experience... Yelp that and head there :-)

Loving the Lifetime.. Clearly you get what you pay for.. but its worth the splurge.. and truly, my opinion is that I can spend the moola out eating or get my butt to the best gym in PHX.. Locker rooms are great.. hair dryers.. sauna.. Love the fact that theres a small little cafe.. so you can grab a HEALTHY bite out the door running to your busy life.. Great pool.. lots of cardio machines and classes!

A great venue to catch the Sunday games. There are several big screens viewable from every seating option; That gives this off the path place a 5stars Large icy pitchers of cold, cheap brewsky...5stars A weird tasting Monte Cristo Sandwich with a dip of grape jelly (not the norm that Ive had)..2 stars .. on the ick side.  A HUGE Stoli bomber during a touchdown that I spoke smack prior to point.. 5stars... TRULY will get you a quick tipsy.. to handle all the bs in this place and the fact you are out in where is this PHX?  A  waitress who continuously called my un-dateable, douche bag of a Sunday game  date  'babe' and flirted while not real friendly to me.. & had to be flagged down despite her leaning on the bar chatty-cathy behavior..forgetting lemon for the weird tasting tap water.. 2stars ... He gets a 0 star and a L on his forehead that is too large anyway.  Sorry if I ask twice.. your a two.. AND to be a flirty girl @ work? That's desperate , yo! I'm a girl raised with a smudge of class and this place is not. So a 1star for your lack of flirt skills!.. Maybe this girl  should show her how to get it done while not irritating the others girls she's supposed to be serving , yes.: serving .. in the group...  All other things bring this place to the fun mode... :-) And down to it, this place COULD be fun, IF the food was decent; the service was up to par; and maybe with a decent guy. Hmmm.. It's a douchey divey wanna be Sunday game day bar .. It fails at best.

This has become a regular stop on the way to see my snowbirding parental unit when they are west of here for the winter.; OR.. .. on the way to Flagstaff for hiking.This great little treasure of a roadside gem is the place for wonderful pies to go! I usually grab two for my family. They do run out of some pies; be warned ! I've had the apple ; coconut cream ; lemon meringue; chocolate chiffon .,, mmmm!  If they are out of your favorite , grab a different one and know it will be delightful!

My boyfriend took me here my last night before our work weekend began. My last night in Vegas with him before he geared up for NASCAR season and I returned to the skies. I had never heard of this place & even was a bit skeptical when he first mentioned it and I've been to Vegas about 5x per year. How could I not have heard of it??    Amazing is what I describe this place as. We got there early. Chris had  a reservation he made the same day. The hostess was unable to find , which may have been a problem on a weekend night; But we sat at the bar and caught up about our day...& tried to warm the crotchedy bartender up. Fail on that. He's old school and seemed  stressed by his 10 or so patrons and staff. Premium liquors and he poured what he liked , it seemed. He had some good wines... No list at the bar..& almost grumpy when you ask for one..lol... BUT I do get a kick out of old codgers like this. So there was no way this guy was gonna get to me on the last night in Vegas. The bartender knew all the wines nonetheless;and pours a good pour. Impressive. Don't try carrying the tab over to the table.. Nope. He's not having that either.   The decor is very old Vegas .. A bit mafioso... Many celebs from the era of when have been here : Marilyn Monroe; Joe Dimaggio; Mario Andretti, to name just the few we saw over the booths named after them and the restaurant  has that feel to it. I personally love character in a place and you will find it here. We ordered the chopped salad... With the Roquefort dressing ... It was divine. The serving size just enough. My date got the ribeye and I the filet...  My usual , when I eat steak. The twice baked potatoe.. And we shared the creamed spinache.. We ordered a Rodney Strong Cabernet.. Offed the bottle and two extra dirty Martinis ; it's Vegas, right?! I can't tell you how amazing this meal was ... Not that I could fit another bite in... My boyfriend didn't want the meal to end without a dessert ... So we ordered my favorite creme brûlée ... And shared it... Yummy... It's not as vanilla--y or creme de la creme as I recall in France but still good ... And bc the waiter liked us so much... He said it was on him... Cheers to that!.. Go there ready to drop some $$ ... It's ala carte ordering ... And this was easily a $180 meal... But oh so worth it... :-) I would say my return factor is 10-10; even with the grouchy bartender.

I like it. I love it. I want some more of it. I've now had two experiences here at Comerica Theatre. Both being great! We arrived via car service both times, so I can't comment on the parking. The theatre is nice. Both times I have had floor level seats about 4-8 rows from stage center. You can see without a problem and the sound and acoustics are amazing. There are screens all around for a closer view. The bartenders are good and bountiful. Not much, if any line, either time I have attended the shows I have seen here. The restrooms are kept clean, that is very important to me, in a place like this that has so many people; trust me, restrooms can get disgusting, fast. On that note, of restrooms, I have not ever stood in line here, either. I also like that no one is allowed to hang out in the concourse areas down to the floor level seats. It bugs me to have to go by people who are using that as their own personal dance hall during a concert when places allow that. Next time, we will try the suite levels. I've heard it's the way to go.

I love Biltmore.. After all it was my start in Phoenix.. Stores are the mix I need: Pottery Barn for my linen fetish; MAC so I can stay looking fly; Williams Sonoma for my culinary love;& ohmygoodness.. A wine bar.. The only things to make it better.. A Nordstrom & a architecture update.. :-)

Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling!  Extras on tables to get your Pho on..  Ordered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)

Consistent service... Very friendly staff. A great place to catch a cerveza, margarita and watch a game... Or a full on meal. The enchiladas are my favorite... Chips & salsa very good... Margaritas I get with patron... That's a plus:-) pretty standard fare... Could use a bit of unique to the menu... But I still love Manuels:-)

Absolutely one of the worst mongolian bbq's I have ever had. The night I stopped in for take out.. I proceeded thru the fix ur bowl line as per normal, but to discover this frozen weird looking assortment of meat? No shrimp... I opted for the cod. I was happy with the veggie assortment and I made the 'spicy sauce' recipe as the sign indicated. I thought $8.50 for a take out box that wasn't full was a bit pricey . When I finally got it home, I couldn't finish it, it was that awful. Guess I will drive across town to my fav mongolian bbq in Tempe the next time I get the urge for that!

I ended up here on a recommendation from a friend.. a friend whos hair is bomb..because pretty obvious Im not going to ask the friend who has drab hair! I got in within a few days.. I love Kristen.. she took time to give me pointers on my hair.. that I had lost due to anemia and a horrible bout of valley fever..I had extensions and that made it worse from a bad technique.. She gave me pointers on the best vitamins to take.. and didnt try to push her products on me.. The cute salon is run by this husband and wife team.. and because I fly free..whenever, wherever.. I had been going to my old standby salon in DC for my hair.. ahhh this is much closer!

It always cracks me up going out in Scottsdale..& just when I say to myself to just say no... One of my friends drags me out...I've been here a few times.. Consistently it's the same scene of Scottsdale junk.. Creepy dudes playing grab ass if your just trying to walk through the place.. Or bartenders with inconsistent drink charges.. The place is always overcrowded.. I mean the dudes outside are there to monitor how one looks & whether one is worthy to enter, right?! How about counting how many peeps you allow in.. We never stay here too long... Music is good... Grey goose tastes the same at another place where there's actual room to move.. Without some strange Affliction wearing tools hands on me...

I finally made it to Furio to meet a friend for a low key nite last nite... parking was easy, considering it was a Saturday nite.. Very friendly.. trendy place to hang. Waiter knew his wines.. and when we had questions over a Merlot vs a Pinot.. he let us sample both.. based on taste, we opted for the heavier Merlot.. Point being... The waiter aimed to please. Had the antipasti plate.. Could have had more cheeses to choose from and a bit more variety on the olives.. Brushetta with filet, very good..  A cool place to hang in Scottsdale... :-)

I met friends here for an impromptu lunch one afternoon. I was completely blown away! First off, this place has a 'real' Italian feel to it from the moment you walk through the door. The tableclothes on the cute little square tables even feel Italian! This cute little restaurant is housed in a strip mall area in Scottsdale. It's small , a little dark and quaint once you step inside. I met my three airline crew  friends there for an afternoon of catching up over lunch. Two of us wanted wine and two of us wanted dirty martinis. Let me begin by saying the wine was a healthy pour of vino! I am NOT complaining ! Our waitress was so sweet and she was Italian too! We just loved her! She was knowledgeable about the menu; she recommended dishes based on our likes and wants. She let us chat and take our time on ordering and that is important because in my group of friends and foodies, dining is a social thing and we have the gift of gab. We ordered a variety of dishes: I had the Crab Louie, priced at $10??? This Crab Louie had THE best louie dressing I've tasted outside of SF! It had the right dose of 'kick' to it to add to the flavor of the overall salad. Amazing! So much food and fresh, FRESH crab!!! My friend had the Chicken Milanese, we all tried it and it was divine! My other two comrades had the Chicken Piccata; I am always a fan of this dish, but I haven't found one here in the valley that I LOVE. This piccata, I loved! Those main pasta entrees all came with a starter of soup or salad; all generous portions. All very tasty! Get this, all the menu items are under $10 for the lunch menu. For dinner it seemed the menu was decently priced under $20 on average. Each of us had take home bags, if we wanted. But we all had stops to make and opted to leave our morsels of goodness behind. The freshly made garlic toasted bread that accompanies the meal is also a good way to blow some hard earned workouts. I ordered two calzones to take home for dinner that night. The Mediterranean Calzone (I minus'd the feta cheese it comes with), is stuffed with mozzerella, ricotta cheese, artichoke hearts, spinach, and olives; and the Special Calzone comes with mozzerella cheese, Italian sausage, and green peppers (I added a dose of pepperoni and took off the green peppers). Our wonderful waitress told me I could do whatever I wanted with the calzones; ANY combination at all! So, my dinner that night cost me less than $15 . I love when I find a gem of a restaurant to hang and be a foodie in the valley! This will now be my new 'go to' Italian place. This place has real Italian charm and taste and the price is right !

Longing to luxuriate and treat my husband after weeks of travel and not actually hop yet another plane ( or into an automobile ) to do so, I decided to book us at The JW Marriott Camelback Inn for a weekend that did not disappoint. I am always amazed at how many beautiful resorts are right here in our own backyard and yet it feels like a world away when you check in! This resort is amazing from check in to check out , the staff here takes no short cuts and makes sure all is on point. Checking in was a breeze; the lobby decorated in southwest style and muted cool tones gave way to the desert heat outside with the darkness. No need to pay for valet parking , as the casitas are all drive able and you can park in front of them. You are offered help with any bags, if need be, and a map of this expansive property and it's amenities. We were upgraded to a bi-level casita and had a beautiful view from both the lower balcony and upper balcony of the mountains surrounding the resort. Perfect for the champagne I had brought and a charcuterie plate on the balcony! This was a surprise for my new husband, after all, as I literally collected him as he landed and said , 'I have a treat for you !' Speaking of champagne though , the bell staff promptly catered to that need for a champagne bucket filled with ice and two flutes! If you don't bring your own, they will gladly bring you a bottle! Ha! Our casita had a tiny tile broken on the corner, well maintenance did not like that and gave us a $50 credit ! I mean, it didn't even bother us!! That's what I mean about the service here: superb! You could easily spend a week here in this casita and never leave the property. We had a small kitchenette with a small refrigerator ; small sink ; a Keurig coffee maker with plenty of coffee and tea pods that were replenished each morning by the cleaning staff; and a microwave. There are no dishes , but we had no issues asking and promptly receiving whatever we requested with a smile within mere minutes from the bell staff.. including real cream! ( I personally loathe powered creamer!) The bedroom upstairs overlooked the beautifully southwestern decorated and designed living room and the bathroom upstairs was expansive with a separate water closet ; dual sinks ; jetted soaking tub and separate large shower with a massive soaking shower head. It's those things that make the JW Marriott special and keep us loyal to the brand. The bathroom downstairs was also a nice touch. I am telling you .. this is a perfect vacation spot, or a staycay or girl weekend, even! There are great restaurants on property although bring your pocketbook as they go with the brand of JW $$$! We truly loved  BLT and Rita's both, with BLT being our favorite for a superb dining experience and a meat lovers dream. The happy hour at the R Bar is superb and has live music! We truly loved this nightly! Starbucks is also on property! There are several places to take a glass of wine and just sit and enjoy the beauty of the desert evening amongst the property along the waterfilled areas with the expansive couches along the cacti and desert flora filled paths. The one thing that I could say needs a bit of an upgrade is the pool; there are only three cabanas not really on the water and the main pool is rather small. There are several pergolas in the shade but you MUST be there early to secure them. The service for drinks and food is also a little lacking and not much by way of food is offered. Our pool guy had to be prompted to take our used glasses away when he brought new beer and drinks, also. Two restrooms service the entire area and are a bit of a walk if you aren't in a cabana. All in all , I love this resort and can't wait to come back! Next time I'll be sure to visit the spa with the amazing views of Mummy Mountain!

THIS is a premium date night, special occasion, celebratory place! My husband surprised me one night to a night out at Lon's At The Hermosa. He had been for before for business dinners and wanted to share how wonderful it was with me. We arrived a little earlier than our reservation to take advantage of a drink during happy hour at The Last Drop on the amazing patio. This, without a doubt, instantly became one of my favorite happy hours in the valley for the setting and the ambience alone. The happy hour includes $6 cocktails and $4 apps. The evening that we were there, we sipped amongst the cacti , fire pits, sounds of live jazz-ical  strums underneath a coppery desert sunset; how could a person NOT love this place? We did not have any apps as I was saving all my space for the dinner I was about to devour, but I'll be back for happy hour drinks and apps one evening for that! My husband had a hand stirred mojito, made with mint from Lon's own garden. Lon's has its own on-property garden of herbs, veggies and fruits and a majority of those are used in the cocktails and in the dishes prepared! The meats and seafoods are fresh and brought in mainly from the west coast. Not only do I love to support locally , but eating organic and as fresh, as possible, makes this even better !  Our reservation was ready right on time and we were shown to a beautiful table under neath the glow of white strung lights and next to the roaring fire place on the patio. Lon's has a authentic southwest feel that is beyond measure and to me, the patio is a must when making a reservation; it simply was ambient and beautiful and truly added to the night in such an amazing way.  Our waiter was welcoming and went over every inch of the menu, which has parts that change weekly. We started with a charcuterie and cheese board that could have easily served four! There were three different cheeses; three meats; a few peppers; dried fruits, along with Arizona honeycomb! How local and unique from other charcuterie boards! This all came with various bread pieces and a jam dipper. See what I mean ? It's ample!  Dinner was the Rack of Lamb for my husband and the Pecan Grilled Filet Mignon for me. I added the splurge, worthy Foie Gras add on for $19; as the waiter assured me , it would be divine and he also assured me that if I wasn't happy with it, he would take it off my bill. Sold! We did NOT need to order the Truffled Mac and Cheese to share , ha! BUT, we did. A Sommelier is on hand and when we were overwhelmed by the very extensive wine list that is a thick, multi-wine-type-volumed book!, he was more than happy to suggest a great wine, allow a tasting or two to get us on the path of vino pairing greatness.  Our entire meal was perfect. The Foie Gras was melt-in-your-mouth like butter perfection! The wine was perfect; the staff and again the utter beauty of Lon's.  We didn't want our night here to end and we shared a Citrus Creme Brûlée and had cappuccinos to finish out the night.  Lon's is an experience, it's not just a place for a meal or drinks. One time here and you will see how this was a setting for a movie and why it gets such amazing reviews.  I can't wait to return for another special occasion and make a stay-cation out of it by staying at The Inn at the Hermosa! For now I have the memory of one of my favorite nights out in this beautiful desert.

Who knew this place was here! I live not a stones throw away.. A gem in the hiding!  My local friends intro'd me to the Orange Blossom.. tall, hint of orange and essence of vanilla in a wheat ale.. Like dessert in a glass.. My tall glass got me a bit buzzedy by 3/4 down.. but thats just the way it goes for me! Nonetheless, my friends also wanted me to try a Belgium Framboise beer.. I couldnt believe it was beer.. its a beauty of purpleish color and fizzy and refreshing...  Papago has the most vast display of rare and common brews Ive seen in the Southwest... impressive..  A casual fun place.. where your palate may learn a new brew or two..

After giving this place such high marks a few weeks ago.. I left there last night feeling a sucker punch of disappointment.. NOT for the Orange Blossom Wheat Ale that Ive grown to love.. but for the fact that half way into it I notice a fly still alive on the top of the brew.. I wasnt going to say anything to the waitress who wasnt overly friendly to begin with.. But my friend  said theres no way.. that she needed to be aware.. Okay.. he goes ahead and tells her.. she has some excuse.. but then we notice theres one at the bottom of the glass too.. Gross.. Im really grossed out at this point.. She basically said I needed to drink it faster.. Im sorry.. college days are gone by.. I dont treat my ales like a beer bong! I sip not guzzle.. and furthermore.. I ordered it only 15 minutes before.. My friend is the most manneristic person in the world.. she said very sarcastically, "you know what, Ill take it off your bill..' takes the beer.. walks off.. rolls her eyes.. slams the glass down at the bar.. and proceeds to tell the other bar girl who then looks at us.. as we are in complete awe.. WOW! You know what.. polite as we are.. we still left the rude girl a 20% tip on the full amount.. You just gave this great place a 2 for me.. :-(

I took my boyfriend here after he said he wanted Beef Wellington for his birthday and I was still too overtaken by Cabo's revenge on my system to make it myself. I had reservations already at Capital Grille, because I saw that Salt Cellar initially had a 3.5 yelp rating. I can honestly say, the Salt Cellar is a pure 5. Upon driving up to Salt Cellar, I was confused by its street 'look'. Its tiny as the restaurant is underground. Stairs, stairs down and we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We had deliberately gone to the Salt Cellar early, so that we could have some oysters on happy hour, (that runs 7 days!), and a couple of drinks prior to dinner. My boyfriend had the $1.50 happy hour Oyster Shooter. Not gonna lie, I was just, icked by that. He loved it though. A raw oyster in a shot glass with a very good cocktail/horseradishy sauce and topped with vodka. Its his birthday.. he can do what he wants! We ordered a app of Oysters Rockefeller. They weren't my favorite, but they were still very good. Some restaurants do rockefeller different and I tend to like mine with a little red sauce involved. At dinner, we started with a very good Emeritus Pinot and the Shrimp San Remo. The San Remo is a specialty here at Salt Cellar. Decent sized prawns in a garlic, wine, butter, sun dried tomatoe saute; capped with portabello slices. Very good. I think I craved that a day later! Katie, our waitress, was an awesome waiter. She knew her stuff and the menu like the back of her hand. Scott inquired about the Turtle Soup and she graciously  brought him a sample. Dinner was me having a large stuffed lobster tail. Stuffed with scallops and crab meat and baked with a panko breading. I paired it with a filet for $18 more. The Beef Wellington Scott had was melt in your mouth awesome. Needless to say we were full by the time we both had a few bites. The breads are divine. The service is impeccable. I love this place!

Perfect day for a brew on a  great winter day.. (in Phx that means its 70 out!).. sat on the patio for a great happy hour.. within five minutes we had ordered.. had two peach ales and the best artichoke spinach dip Ive had in the valley at a restaurant.. Friendly waiters and laid back atmosphere...& not the typical Mill Ave crowd.. . The vittles and beer.. perfect delight for the taste buds...

Meeting the guy I'm dating for a quick moment of happy hour. He chose Four Peaks. It's jacket weather on a sunny day, but loved the patio. This place is happening and has good, friendly staff and good brews all it's own namesake. A decent menu of apps and foods. We arrived at about 400p on a Friday afternoon. Could very well have been standing room only, but luckily my quick, savvy, obviously traffic dodging guy got there to secure a good table before me. Since I am more of a wine and vodka girl, I don't know beer that well. I always have to ask the difference between dark, lager, ale and stout. The waiter was busy but he suggested I try samples to make my choice. I won't lie, the Kilt Lifter wasn't as dark as I would like but the Oatmeal stout was too... well... stout! A stout that stout needs a half hard cider for me to be able to hang! Ummm that isn't to be here at the 4 Peaks. AND that is okay:-) Of course, the lightweight I am, I had 3/4 of my Kilt Lifter and was gonna have to submerge it with a little food action or I was gonna be very tips! We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip. Generous portion of sharing goodness. Lots of fresh triangles of pita and crisp, fresh warm tri colored chips. The waiter also kept our waters filled. Important to a girl like me when enjoying libations of alcohol! The brewery is near ASU, so it's a mix of alot of collegiates and many, many biz men and older couples. No worries on ambience. It's a popular, happening place. Lots of fun and good beer. Parking a bit of a crank. But not as bad say in larger cities. End result. 4 out of 5. :-)

It is said that everyone loves a wise guy. I know I do after my night with one in a little corner of Heritage Square.  After living in the valley permanently for a few years now and hearing all about Pizzeria Bianco, I decided it was finally time to add this gem of pizza pies to my lovely lists of favorites.. I knew it would be good.  In the south corner sits the quaint romantical Pizzeria Bianco and we arrived just in time to beat a wait. Luckily we got a cute table against the exposed brick wall of what reminded me of a pizza bistro in Italy. Within 15 minutes of our arrival PB had a wait with people lined up outside to be seated ... we, however, were cozied up with a glass of chianti perusing PB's simple, yet very authentically Italian pizze menu.  I ordered the WiseGuy; a smoky white pizza white smoky, carmelized white onion, smoky mozzerella, hand sliced fennel sausage to which I added the wood roasted mushrooms that tasted so wonderfully and lightly roasted to my taste buds, I could have had those as a separate side dish on their own.  My husband loves a red pizza and we can never meet in the middle and compromise on a white or red pizza to split, so he ordered the Sonny Boy that was baked with just the right amount of tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, olives and salami. The crust on Pizzeria Bianco pizza is the point that makes it amazing; as with all amazing pizzas. It was just the right amount of crunch and right amount of bake. I won't rate a crust or pizza pie well, if the crust is chewy and this isn't. Two people could split one of these pies, as they are about 11-12 inches in size each. We love leftover pizza though! After our pizza, we lingered over more Chianti because the ambience of Bianco is so lovely and quaint; the staff is friendly and won't rush you despite the waiting people out the door. We opted for the Flourless Chocolate Torte with Vanilla Sauce to share to cap out our evening at Bianco, take it from me, share this ! It's like eating a very, rich deep, dark piece of heavenly, sinful chocolate ... So, so good. Date night worthy.

"Good Friends, Great Steaks and The Best Booze are the necessities of life". This  is the philosophy of Jack Durant, the founder of Durant's. I happen to agree!  Anyone who has lived in PHX for anytime should know of Durant's ; this steak landmark has over a 60 year history here! I love a restaurant that has history. Durant's has been in the same spot on Central Avenue since 1950, when it was opened by Jack Durant. Tonight I finally got my chance to experience the charm and amazement of steak, nostalgia , (and yes, the best booze!),  of Durant's when my boyfriend wanted to get me out of the house following a rather complex surgery and off to Durant's we went. Entering in through the back is a treat; everyone greets you like family and the kitchen is impeccably clean. That's awesome. Entering into a flash back to the days of mafioso, red velvet walls; padded upholstery and leather, I am already in love with the stories the walls of this restaurant must hide. We order our pre-dinner cocktails. Durant's is known for it's Martinis. Double dry and double dirty. A chilled relish tray is served, as it has been since it's days of old, with the famous terrine of bleu cheese. My parents do that at their dinner parties!  We ordered  an appetizer of Oysters Rockefeller . It was a completely generous serving; I highly recommend! For our entrees, we ordered the filet mignon, with three prawns. The filet was thick at 8 ounces and cooked to perfection with the right amount of seasoning. The prawns were generous in size and not tough or chewy, as some places can serve them. They come served with warm drawn butter. I opted for the salad with a side of roquefort dressing. Again, a generous salad that could easily be a meal. My boyfriend ordered the Delmonico steak which was a nice, hearty 20 ounces!! Holy bovine! He ate about a third of it! He opted for the beef barley soup as his starter because like the Roquefort dressing on my salad, it's something that just reminds you of growing up and 'home'. You just don't find those types of little things always in 'modern' restaurants sometimes. Can you think of the last time that roquefort was not called 'Bleu cheese' ? Or when 'beef barley' soup was even seen on a menu?? Nope. I haven't. To go with the starters, we had a pinot noir and a glass of Mumm champagne. The 'wine by the glass' list is extensive , as is the bottle list. In fact, if your feeling deep pocketed on a special night , they have a double magnum of several wines and champagnes. I'm impressed. Oh and speaking of impressed , the house made boule of warm bread served with the starters is served with garlic, leeks, herbs and warm olive oil. This treat just melts in your mouth and you won't want plain rolls anymore. Our steaks showed up perfectly, with a large ramekin of garlic mashed potatoes that we were barely able to take three bites from. Yeah. They came home too with our leftover steaks. My boyfriend is somehow 'lucky' enough to have a Durant's token for a complimentary dessert for LIFE! Our waiter , Ron, treated that as something pretty special. We were seriously full, BUT, there is always room for a dose of a sweet treat, right ? We split the tray of brûlées. Three melt in your mouth brûlées: chocolate with chantilly; a berry brûlée; and a brûlée of espresso type. We night capped our night  with a Di Saronno amaretto neat and cappuccino. Durant's is an amazing downtown place and a must for anyone wanting a divine steak and night with a past feel. Our waiter was superb. You exit through the kitchen and say goodnight to the 'family' who prepared your amazing meal. Know you just dined in a place where governors , sports legends and movie stars have dined and wheeled, dealed and sealed; so much history here, you want your night to last and last ! Bon Appetite!

Conserve water. Drink tequila.  When in Mexico. Si. When in the Barrio. Si. Si. Si.  Enter through the back where you park.. and sit in this artistic gem of a restaurant. It's tight. So suck it in. The strum of a guitar played as we tucked ourselves into our table. There is live music here from Thursday thru Saturday in the evenings and adds to the ambience. A very nice touch to this quaint place with amazing food. It's definitely tight in here. It reminds me of cafes in Europe. You may or may not get to know your eating neighbors. So since we are conserving aqua.. I started with the Paloma. It came delivered by our friendly waiter with a salted rim and consisted of Patron Reposado Tequila, Mexican grapefruit soda and fresh lime juice. My husbands house margarita was legitimately worthy. We started with the table side guacamole. Our waiter rolls up and makes this with whatever you like. Pomegranates? We will pass. But everything else and it was perfect with awesome chips. The bread and an olive spread paste that was complimentary for the table was very good too. The menu is so diverse and some of the best native Mexican dishes from Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza that I have seen outside of Mexico. It's truly hard to decide on one thing! I ended up ordering the Enchiladas del Mar. These enchiladas are blue corn tortillas  filled with quesos of Oaxaca and de cabra, topped with lots of shrimp, lump crab and scallops in a tomatillo cream. I had the scallops held and that wasn't a problem. One small issue after they were delivered, is that I wanted a salsa type sauce. My waiter seemed either confused or taken aback. I even pointed out the sauce/salsa on other plates on the table and he pretty much just didn't bring it! Cmon now! The enchiladas were amazing! I just wanted to 'salsa' them up a little.. okay. So, one of the other people got an extra salsa and simply passed it to me. As, he simply never brought it. While dining the Filet de mi Tita arrived at the table next to us. I have never been one to go to a Mexican cafe and order steaks.. THIS time.. its on my 'to go back and order list'.. THIS steak was HUGE! It was on the menu for $26 and was piled with crab. I have had lesser filets in steak restaurants for way , WAY more than that price! Following dinner I ordered the cafe. I had no idea this was going to arrive in a larger than normal french press! $3.95 and you get a HUGE french press full of amazing Mexican cafe and pure cream..if you choose. Enough to share, trust me. We also just HAD to share the Churros Rellenos de Cajeta de Cabra. They are also pretty big! Shareable and filled with creamy, rich goat's milk and caramel; then served warm with vanilla ice cream , MORE warm caramel and candied pecans. The Flan de mi Miami. I mean, we had to order and share this too! Also topped with candied pecans and a little Kahlua and a generous portion, as well. Melt in your mouth amazing.  The facade of The Barrio Cafe is in itself so unique.. I spent at least ten extra minutes taking photos of the art. Inside there is more eclectic art, as well. As we left we felt lucky for getting to The Barrio Cafe about 615pm on a Friday night and not having to wait more than 15 minutes, because as we were leaving there was a HUGE wait outside and standing room only. I can see why this place was featured on Diners, Drive In's and Dives with Guy Fieri. I seriously just have to go back now and stick with the plan to taste what he highlighted on that show! http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/barrio-cafes-cochinita-pibil-0206541.html Barrio Cafe is a perfect place for the senses of taste, smell and to the artful eye!

Say what you will, Im kind of digging on the Tee Pee... It looks a bit divey... and the food was so hot I burned my lips off.. but thats not a TP prob, thats a airhead Kimberly problem! The chips are a bit on the staley side.. but I loved the Huevos Rancheros.. the place was packed... good margaritas, good salsa.. good service.. all deserving of my 4...

My besties took me here for my birthday this year when I said I was craving a little sushi and a little kobe steak. Our waitress was awesome! She recommended different sushis and sashimis that I had not tried before and because it was my birthday and I could do what I wanted, I ordered a ton of different ones to go with a small filet. We polished a bottle (or two) of good red wine, a few martinis, and sake all for the sAKE of birthday girl wishes. What I love about Sapporo is that you can do a Teppan table or just do a basic sushi 'order off the menu' type of dinner. My favorite roll became the 'Friends with Benefits' roll. Everything that a friend.. with benes.. should be. But I ate it and left .. Ha! Mention a birthday or special occasion and they will bring you a treat. Summer has the Happy Hour All Day Menu.. Do that while you watch cougars prey on the young!

I've always been a fan of Emeril Lagasse & had wanted to dine here on other visits to Las Vegas for dinner and just wasn't able to. This time we ventured off our own hotel property to dine at Emeril's here at The MGM. We had a reservation for 500pm & were stuck in traffic on the strip and had to call and push back; not a problem; the staff was more than accommodating. If your coming from somewhere else, I highly recommend valet'ing your car; it's too far to walk from self parking and confusing. The MGM is also always packed and so large, it's a little hard to navigate. We arrived for dinner and were seated promptly. Again, I don't recommend not having a reservation. You can get a reservation from Open Table via the Yelp app; makes it super easy! We started by telling the waiter that someone in our party had less than an hour for dinner; the waiter suggested ordering quickly and was accommodating to his needs. The rest of us wanted to relish our dinner and enjoy the experience. We started with frog legs ( off the current prix fixe menu and priced separately) and andouille sausage gumbo. Loved the frog legs with house made ranch for dipping. You get 5 nice sized legs; fried just right and good to share. The gumbo was a bit salty, in my opinion; maybe because I was taught in the dirty south by a southern mama how to make it just right?! My water glass and lemon never went empty; just out of surgery this was a dry trip to Las Vegas. My fellow diners, however, had Cosmo Martinis and a southern beer called, TurboDog. Impressive wine list to couple the display of wines encased. I wish :) My next course was the filet and broccolini. It was cooked to perfection and spice rubbed with a blend of Emeril's pepper and various other Cajun type spices. There was a wine and mushroom reduction that went well with the meat and the smashers I ordered on the side; yummy mashed Yukon gold potatoes that easily served 3-4! My dining mates had the fish pan roast and crab cake; both were amazing ! The crab cake off the appetizer menu is very generous and not at all , typical . It was loaded with nice, fresh lump crab. Yummy. My boyfriend ordered the cornbread , which is literally a pan full! Afterwards, 3 of us split the $10 banana cream pie ; as if we were not full enough! It was a good 4 inches tall and so rich and delicious. The Fiori espresso is perfect to end with ... I was impressed by the staff and food ; the decor is getting dated for a place and Chef so amazing ; it's very late 90's and the dining music was very 'disco' ; if it's supposed to be a fine dining experience with the price tag to match ... Change up the music to match the class :)

The first time I went to AZ88 was on a date... well, I got lost, as usual..but it can be tricky to find..or maybe its just me being blonde?? BUT I loved this place.. the entire place is hopping... Ive been there 3 times in the past 6 months..and its always hopping! Love the bar... the patio.. I love the drinks...which are all on the girly side, but I love it! The trendy decor of NY cabs.. super cool and unique.. Love the fries with the dipping sauces..Ive had salads here..and burgers..and its a great point of start for what follows on date nite...OR not.. you can always dump the date..and sit at the bar..trust me, everyone is friendly...so you wont feel like the single single... Watch the bathroom doors....sober I have issues getting the dang doors open...and not feeling like the dumb blonde of AZ88..

ONE of my very favorite sushi restaurants... here is what I love.. No res.. The staff was instrumental in working us in amongst the planned and organized with reservations..ITS Saturday nite enroute to Tao, we opted to take the cab to Nobu.. and do a sidestep of Tao for Nobu... AND that is because my friends and I were looking for primo sushi.. having told you my nite in Vegas as it unfolded.. I will now get to the review! Feeling a bit clubby in our dresses, stillettos and all of our long hair.... WE decided to sit at the sushi bar (I admit I would hate if my clan showed up with the 'here we are' attitude on Sat nite wanting to be seated amongst the mix AND now, dammit!)... The chef was entertaining and suggestive of many sashimi choices and sushi options... he just said, 'hed take care of us', and the rest followed.. amongst sake... and many, many varieties of sushi/sashimi between my group.. I didnt have one thing that I didnt love!  Pricey.. maybe..worth it..Absolutely..  AND now to Tao..

I was pleasantly surprised when we stayed at The Mirage. The room is decent sized... Choices for late night dining... Bathroom kind if small, but try going to Paris or any other European city and see the size of your bathroom. Just sayin, spoiled Americans.. The check in staff.. Awful.. Rude beyond words. The girl acted better than anyone.. & never mustered a smile the entire time.. We were stuck here after flight issues so it's okay for one night.. But that check in girl.. Wow. The hike from check in to elevator.. Long. And no one offered to take bags when we got out of cab. It's the little things.. Location is good... Mid strip.

I always choose to stay here at the MGM Grand when I do my twice yearly Vegas run.. Heres the thing.. Its central.. Its got all that you need... late night craving for McD's.. or Haagen Dazs.. its here.. Upscale dining.. yep., that too.. Awesome night clubs.. and always alot going on..  This time I stayed in the West Wing rooms.. They had a very "W Hotels" feel to them.. nice, retro meets modern feel. Not crazy about the layout of the shower, watercloset.. But thats because Im super private! EVEN with my best friend ; I still need a bit of my space not invaded.. but a tv over my vanity.. loved that..   Not crazy about the buffet...but it was a promo I had.. so went, we tried , we feasted and not liking buffets anyway.. Ill pass next time.  The bell boy.. he was rude.. point blank.. he actually rolled his eyes and huffed.. bc he was a different guy then who valet'd and took our bags downstairs.. we tipped all of our cash to him.. YES we looked and felt like losers.. but come on.. a tip is that.. its a tip for great service.. okay.. i write this feeling egg in my face!  Ill go back to the suites.. or the Grand Tower rooms.. the 'basic' room at the MGM now that the Emerald Tower is no more.. and yes.. I will continue to say here.. I love the MGM:-)

A weekend jaunt to Vegas with friends to celebrate a birthday weekend ended up with dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. I love this place. We had a reservation, as there were about 12 of us. They would not seat us til all of the party was there. We opted to wait in the crowded bar and have frenchy little drinks til we could be seated. The waitress was awesome! I have multiple food allergies and she first took down, patiently, what they were, so that no cross contamination would occur in the kitchen process. This was a Saturday night and it was packed! She gave me pointers on what to order and there was also a gluten free menu. The menu actually had more than just a few items too and gluten free bread was served with olives just like the other gluten lad bread. Gotta say, I was impressed. I had the filet au poivre ; so good and tender. We had mussels for an app, duck confit and cheeses, as well. Everything was amazing. The creme brulee was a bit boring. All in all its a great place with a great view of the fountains if you get the right seat in the dining room, as we did OR out on the patio. There are warmers, in case of chilly nights. Make a reservation! This place gets busy!

Stayed here with a group that met in Las Vegas for a friends wedding. I usually stay at MGM Grand for the convenience of it. It is in the middle of all of what, I feel, is needed in Vegas. I was a little apprehensive staying here, as I had a bad experience here a few years ago and said I'd never be back. Nonetheless, our friends were here and this is where we opted to be for them. We booked a suite via my MLife card and saved a good 20% off our suite. Upon arriving into Vegas, the Luxor had a VIP check in line. But my status with MLife wasn't good enough. I hate lines. I don't do them. I am quite impatient in them, in fact. I have to be a little foo foo in this review ;-) The line moved rather quickly and quickly we were on our way up to our suite. We had a corner suite with the view of the strip; well, as far as one can see down the strip at the Luxor, since it sits a little off the main strip. Our room was dated. It was big and the bed was comfy and firm. The room was dated, though. It is in need of a renovation that gets it out of the 90's with all the purple velvet couches and diamond printed rugs. The armoire, was warped and falling apart. The suite was nice though. Relatively quiet. The hot tub sat on a platform of tile, (thats a little dangerous if its wet on the tile from the hot tub and there is any alcohol involved), overlooking the street. We liked being able to take a hot tub at the end of a night of debaucheries out. The Luxor doesn't have as many restaurants open as MGM late at night for drunchies. But there is a Starbucks. I was okay with this hotel. But it's not my fav and again, needs renovation. The design is cool and the layout works. Just update the hotel already.

After landing in Vegas for a little getaway with my boyfriend.. and getting settled into our room.. we decided we wanted a beer and lunch... and then a nap so we could stay up and party all night.. Vegas style. We got to Pink Taco just in time for Happy Hour. They have a very good happy hour menu. We did order off the regular menu. I had been to the Pink Taco  in Scottsdale, AZ, prior to it's closing, a few times, so I knew the menu a bit, and love the pink tacos. We ordered those , the queso and a sampler appetizer plate. The appetizer plate was full of appetizer...a quesadilla, carne asada skewers, chicken tikki skewers, taquitos (which are so different here I LOVE!!).. the queso bean dip was too much and lacking in spice for us.. We kept adding hot sauce to it.. as well as the salsa that comes with the chips. BUT this is a great happy hour with 2 for 1 beers.. we even came back again during our stay. Be ready for that nap after your Mexican carb overload!

You may have to wait for clearly some of the best burgers in AZ..or the west for that matter.. I dont really eat red meat, but every now and then..if worth it..I will shock my system.. Go ahead and cheat with the fries..they come in a cutesy shopping cart with aioli.. do it! My buddy had a burger....all engrossed with cheese and bun and sauce..I had to try it...it was orgasmic! BUT I love me some asian salad..and I ordered that after I inquired as to what it was earlier as it was delivered to the table next to me... IT is a huge salad.. huge!!! Yummy thai peanut dressing and another dressing on the spicier side comes with too... We sat in the middle..the long counter with blue lights.... we were seated on the patio..but the drip system...well, was drippy! So they happily moved us.. martinis and wine ... very good...staff very nice and accomodating..He even gave us a sweet little discount..I wont say why.., but he liked us.:-) ;-) .. but we gave it back in tip... My guy friend got a dessert next door...@Delux to go... looked yum...but I dont have the metabolism of a guy so I choose to not....

I truly have no words.. Maybe because Im speaking a mix of Chinese/Spanish/English jibberish upon the exit of this seemingly divey place with an awesome, yet interesting fusion of taste sensation..  THIS is truly some of the best service I have received in SOOOO long.. My parents took me here so we could get some fast, cheap, yummy take out for movie nite... While they were being snowbirds from Cali. The place was crowded as heck! Bandidos yo! Several of my friends have  been here a lot..and they rave of the place...my parents said they knew I'd love it.. My dad, acting like a AZ pro, told the cute, friendly girl that I was a newbie to the chi/bando. She had a line.. and amazingly, she started serving up like 8 samples of the most ordered items! I loved it! Jade chicken was my favorite;Carnitas a second.;the rice is the bomb...the black beans remind me of San Juan PR type... and thats authentic!  My sidekick, aka Jeran  ordered a quesadilla, with his Jade Red, and they got a bit interesting with it.. adding the jerk chicken to the quesadilla. Honestly I thought that was weird.. but miscomm somewhere, again..its a different language.. learn it, live it and by all means... yum-yelp-eat it! I am glad my parentals watch so many tele shows and found this on Diners Drive In's and Dives. All the way in Nor Cali!  PS. Don't be scared of the neighborhood, yes. It is sketchy. And I am not really a fan of the seating area. We got in . We got out. Alive. With our foil wrapped Chino B. Yum

Still a 5! Ever since my parents found you on Diners, Drive In's and Dives, I have been in love. I literally crave Chino whenever I get a little under the weather now. How did I live in the valley and not know you were here and yet my parents live in California and knew of you? Oh well. I know you now and I drive the distance to fetch your Red Jade.What can I say.. . I love the ChinoB!

OOOHHH a G-Spot...I gotta say yeah ,yeah..yes.... loves it...  This is my bit of indulgence....Im a basic girl.. give me a basic vanilla bean.. and a bit of sugar free raspberry.. a bit to the left ... a little to the right.. and its a swirl of ......what I like.. ;-) G would get a 5 but my vanilla was a snitch on the icy ... so its still high at a 4, the girl working behind the counter though, hmm seems she could use a bit of sweet G... i mean, it is a dessert shop... after all...oh well... maybe she should learn to let go to her indulgences... we all should, truly.. a little G goes a long way... this I know for sure:-)

If you need to get your sweet spot sweet with just a little touch of this and a little of that the G Spot is always sweet on. I never like to get too sweet , BUT, when I feel the need I go where some have thought of. It's the perfect size.. Serving size, of course. Not too much , not too little. My personal fav is the Straticello, a vanilla--y gelato with shavings of dark chocolate throughout. Hits the spot and makes you say... 'ummmmm...more!' .... You can sample til your content of all the g's and it's good little date spot near dinner spots. But you can have too much of a good thing.. as many of us know. And when you need a hard dose of reality....and have had your fill of 'ummms, ahhs, and oh yes's'... well, theres always hard nosed espresso right next door.

LOVED THE cute in this place:-) Went here on a date.. its coolio for that.. HOWEVER, I didnt care for the pizza we had... and its not to say the other pizzas arent better! I had the Pesto, my 'date' ordered.. I just thought the combo of potatoes with pesto on a crust was odd.. BUT I loved the antipasto platter.. a huge assortment of olives.. and the marinade was awesome.. Great wine.. great service! Ill go back for sure... and just order something without potatoes and pesto!! :-)

New to PHX ... and feeling not into much... someone in my industry took me out for a late nite bite... what I love about FEZ...its open late...and its stylish.. good music... good drinks...different salads and kisras... a trendy place for a late date... and in my career that is an important thing.. The staff is always nice.. the restrooms are clean.. They always have specials...and as weird as it sounds, if you follow them on facebook.. you will be in on the FEZ'know'... of the specials.. break your diet and get the sweet potatoe fries dusted with cinnamon..... and they serve up some kick ass girly martinis... but if you are there with your straights.. and that would be me.. then get your wine on.. they have some I bet you havent seen before... Ive been here at least a dozen times.. the only bad thing is driving home.. yikes..

SOOOO a date takes me to Chelseas Kitchen.. and its a good thing..bc since I wasnt sure of him..the atmospere is lively..so if the date bombs you have that! I loved the Sangrias and the food... and the atmosphere... Had the tuna tartare... perfect... I only had comparable in Maui... Pretty good to me considering its the desert!  The Del Mar Salad with shrimp and crab was excellent... My date had scallops and Im not a fan..but they were cooked the way they should be... The waiter was attentive..if not TOO attentive..but to me thats the LGO way... He was just a bit hyper ... ordered a white wine with dinner..but kept going back for more white sangrias...

Chelsea.. tonight your gonna rate a 2.. heres why.. I rave and rave about your sangrias and apps to my BFF, so we head there on his bday weekend.. no wait for the uber cool patio.. order a pitcher of sangria.. and nachitos.. Well, first off.. the sangria pitcher was half fruit.. Ive never had that in the past.. and I swear there wasnt hardly any wine in the thing.. because Im a super lightweight and didnt feel a thing.. Not that thats the reason I go to get sangrias, but cmon! And the taste was just off.. The nachos didnt have alot of 'stuff' on them.. havent had that in the past either.. and the waitress messed up the order.. the girl who delivered the nachos quickly remedied it.. but nonetheless.. maybe next time..

After hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog  loving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali..

You know how it is.. when your jones'n for something .. your just gonna have to find it.. ENTER yelp app on the iPhone! Boom .. Bobby Q's within 15 minutes of my home.. during the rain and the wind.. thats what I needed .. good old barbeque.. Really.. I couldnt decide how or what to order to get my comfort food on.. because that is the way the menu rolls.. Ended up with the 2 meat platter.. split with someone else.. salad on the side.. perfect.. pulled pork, beef brisket.. yum..  mashed potatoes are the kind grandma used to make..  my cohort in jones'n crime got her carb on with the mac/cheese.. (kind of velveety' for me..but still yummy)..  AWESOME corn muffins..  Alfonso, our waiter.. the best Ive had in months:-)  Oh yeah.. they love yelpers .. mention it.. see what you get:-)

Im a new fan.. I have been wanting to try this place and when my friend wanted to meet me for lunch near his firm .. I suggested this ..since I know its a coolmobee on yelp! Upon first walk on in.. its trendy.. and right up my liking.. It looks ultra bar ish.. yet friendly in the downtown.. They have a cool cheap $8.95 lunch menu.. but I opted for sharing the guacahummus with pita chips and pita bread  and was jonesn' for the grilled peach salad.. Opting for the small and it was more than enough.. My buddy got the enchiladas and it was more than enough.. Ticoz you have  won us over.. And its a nice touch that the chef came over to see if everyone was happy... friendly, friendly.. Love it!

FOR PHX..Im giving this place a 5... I grew up with these gourmet shops in Cali.. and then lived by Wegmans in DC.. but Love LOVE AJ's for its wine and cheese department... and if I need a petit four... they have them too.. those are a bit hard to find in the Southwest... They have the fondue I had in Switzerland... I mean, seriously, Im pretty impressed.... and that is hard to do.. :-)

I adore Maggianos.. Brett is the best waiter.. Had him 2x..& he's simply the best. He knows the menu.. How to pair wine well.. Reminds me of sommoliers in France.. encourages people like me to get away from the manicotti & try a truffle cream tortellina :-) this has become my splurge every couple of months... A chain without a chain feel..

I wandered in here as a rush effort for some calories before my friends and I were headed to Fashion Square... its quick and relatively cheap.. Im not much for counter service places.. here you order at the counter and they table serve you from there.. AND I freak out over pasta..but they have a good selection of salads... so we were okay..and I dont have to be the high maintenance girl amongst my other girls! BUT... maybe Olive & Ivy down the street would have been a better choice.. not for anything other than my own personal taste!

Good martinis, margs and great happy hour... AND great for dinner too if your headed out to Old Town, Id do this over some of the other Scottsdale outs.. I had the blood orange marg.. loved it.. one drink and I am a done--er... so it was good that the happy hour was there! I dont eat lots of bread, but had to that day... and its yummy! My date, (I use that word very cautiously... ) was rude and demanding and the staff put up with his overbearing, high maint ways.. more than they should have... crab cakes are awesome..:-) Dinner I had the Wildfish Chopped Salad... I actually crave that salad now!

I can't rate this resort highly enough. This was a weekend getaway gift from my boyfriend. It's close enough to Phoenix that it's doable as a luxury stay-cay and yet you feel you are nowhere near a city... At.All. Upon arrival the security gate has your name on file and you are welcomed. A little more ways in, the valets greet you promptly and start unpacking your car while you check in. At first site, I felt relaxed and that is the point of this place. The mood is very 'Zen-like' and I loved the decor and all of the boulders around the property. The casitas, villas and rooms are spread out throughout this expansive property and golf course. My boyfriend booked a 'detached' casita facing the number 5 hole and underneath a perfect shade tree,( which would be handy for morning brunch or afternoon cocktails) on the green. The casita was beautifully appointed with a high ceiling , rock fireplace, poster bed, a separate soaking tub and shower. There were two huge leather chairs for hanging out. Seriously you think you are all alone because it was so quiet. We were whisked away by our bell man and given direction on how to call or text for a shuttle around the property for dinner or spa treatments or golf. The concierge did not miss a beat on making sure we had all we needed in way of reservations for our meals. I will review the restaurants on property separately. The room service is 24 hours, as well. We ordered brunch each morning to enjoy our patio. The pools are open 24/7 .. I only wish they had cabanas at the pool, but they don't. Yes it's a splurge; it's a Waldorf Astoria. It's worth every splurging penny. The staff; the ambience and the treatment is spoiling from check in to check out. I can't wait for the opportunity to splurge again here.

The Vig is my 'go to' place when hanging near my home in the area. No other bar has peaked my interest and kept my attention the way The Vig has here. Love the Mondays, when burgers are $5. Love Sunday Funday's at The Vig. Get there before your Saturday night hangover starts really making you feel hung and get your 'hair of the dog' sangria, mimosa or bloody mary on the patio while you enjoy the up tempo of live music. The bar is happening too for watching games and cool, friendly bartenders. Sundays are cheaper wine by the bottle days too. Pet the cat that hangs on the patio. He's not annoying. He likes to say hi and hopes that you will drop a snack for him. Bocce ball on the patio. I find the wine a little less pricey at Postino, if your comparing a watermelon to a grape. But this is still my fav, all around go-to place. Valet is pretty much the only way here. Now The Vig has even comandeered the parking lot across the way for $ too on valet. Not to keen on that idea. But not enough to make me rate them any less or keep me away. LOVE the firepit outside in the winter.

Love , love Lush... Rockstar cut soap .. Yum.. It's my favorite & I can't be swayed away.. The edgy Lush-ites are happy to help you fugure out your skin needs.. Or hair by golly! Even taught me how to not get razor burn on my sensitive skin... :-)

I have been here more than a handful of times and I really WANT to like ...No! I want to LOVE this place ... but I can't get over how dirty it feels when ever I am here. I love the menu, which is very English to me... Lots of pasty options. But when a place is dirty and sticky, I can't get around the fact that my food is likely not prepared in the most hygienic of states either. This past week we opted for this for a quick bite while we found ourselves in Tempe.. again, I like the menu and there are a few ciders, mine wasn't cold and ciders need to be icy to be tasty. I wasn't wow'd by the Oven Chips.. a version of the French Fry, which were drenched in oil and not one bit of crisp.. my Guinness Stew Pasty was lackluster, but it sounded great on the food splattered menu..  and again... this place is filthy, downright to the disgusting bathrooms. Pass.

In the search to quash a craving for some good chips & salsa.. I was told to try this place out.. and as my gps was taking too long to find me.. and where Im going?!.. I took the advice of a wise..and 'should be ..would be yelper'.. and made the left on Cave Creek.. Loved the chips.. Im quite picky about my chip texture and salsa spice and texture too.. Even opted for a ala carte chicken taco..service a bit slow.. but all in all Im a fan:-)

I have to admit I am pleasantly surprised by this place. It's down on Baseline and I just don't know that I am a fan of this area. However, my new residence is here with my love, so I need to find places where I can get some sake bombers and sushi and not become illegal whilst driving home. I came here, honestly, because of the star rating by my fellow yelpers. Figured the worst that could happen is being poisoned by what one should probably not eat in a desert anyway or I could find good, quality, sushi and have that close to my new home. I love happy hour; cheap drinks and pretty good menu but not any real special rolls on the happy hour menu. That said I find the regular menu to not be badly priced & the staff is sweet end accommodating. I have since ordered take out Chinese and that is good too. I'm impressed because this side if town is lacking in places to really eat that I end up liking enough to return to. However, I am a fan!   PS- they have boba and $1 egg rolls .. Get in it.. Mushi mushi ;-)

Hands down.. Tarbell's is not just a 5..it's a 10! My husband and I love to celebrate life's little joys. It gives us a reason to be foodies and out do each other with who is gonna pick which place in the valley to try next. On this night, we were celebrating the day we started dating and Valentines Day a tad early due to upcoming travel due to work. We both had made reservations here ! Ha! I had never been here, despite that just a few years ago I lived practically next door. I canceled my reservation , we kept his. We arrived and I immediately loved the decor which is what I thought it would be: upscale; classy clientele; white linen table cloths. This place was busy on a Thursday night! My tip: always make a reservation in advance! Our table was in the corner at the window and our server was Nathan. We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir from home and the Crispy Rock Shrimp. It was a super, generous portion of shrimp and was cut into bite sized morsels. The sauce had a bit of a citrusy asian taste to it. We loved this as a starter. I ordered the Scotch Beef for my entree; and the Caesar with Kale and Romaine to go with and for balance. My husband's first choice of entree was Tar's Beef Stroganoff with Gnocchi. He really wanted this , as he is a gnocchi king! Nathan, advised us that he thought they may be out of this entree and what would his second option be , in case? That was a bummer.. and would have been a nice point made at the beginning when Nathan discussed the menu with us. Scott said he would go with the Fish of the Moment, which was a lightly sautéed sea bass. We didn't know what was showing up until it arrived! The salad was divine and very good. I could have made a meal of that alone. It was a generous portion and the kale wasn't too much as sometimes kale can be in salads. The dressing was just enough and not too heavy. The Scotch Beef... OMG.. to die for. It's like a delectable hunk of beef amassed delicious mashed potatoes, a velvety rich gravy and fresh cut green beans. This dish is rich, gluten free, generous in portion and so delicious. I took half of it home! Because it was our 'anniversary' to a degree and I had also let the restaurant know on MY reservation that my husband was celebrating a major milestone with his company, Nathan brought us the Cheesecake with Rosemary Caramel Sauce. I am not really one for cheesecakes , THIS is like NO other cheesecake I had ever had. It's perfect and round.. topped with this amazing, rich, and different caramel sauce with a hint of rosemary.. paired with the perfect Port.. Voila! Perfecto! I can see why Mark Tarbell was the Iron Chef and why this amazing restaurant has all the accolades it does.. ! I can't wait for another reason to go back! Don't forget to grab your popcorn on the way out :--)

Today isn't my day for for a mani ... This place is THE worst place ever in PHX for a mani ... Like. EVER.  Ended up here on a whim. I have had the worst luck in PHX for finding manis that last.. work.. and don't chip after a few days. JUST when I think I find one.. Some failure hits. We just were driving, my friend and I on a Friday and ended up here. No rhyme. No reason. That is probably the reason that it all went down in a big.fat.fail. The lady I got on first notice was completely rude. I should have in hindsight.. just said.NO.Thanks. But no. I am always the optimist for a good ending. I also always think it maybe me.. AM I doing something to offend her? My face? MY look? Zip it in Kimberly, I tell myself. So she starts to take off my gel.. says something in her language to herself and walks off. She is gone for a good 7-10 minutes. I am seriously on a time crunch on this day. I don't have time for her to just leave me half gell'ed! When she returns she tells me that my acrylics under the gel are a 'mess'.. though they aren't. I have had my short acrylics (I use only to protect my base nail from breakage on planes) for awhile.. I know when a new set is needed due to lifting or cracking or whatever and when I don't . I tell her I just want a fill. Simple. Just a fill and gel french manicure. Please. Thank You. She gets up and leaves yet again! This time for another 7-10 minutes. I am seriously so confused. My friend has opted to just get a new set of nails but hers are in seriously bad shape. She is almost done and her mani is more involved than mine! My lady returns. Now I tell her I am in a time crunch. She snappily replies that 'I am making it hard for her because my nails are 'bad'.. '.. I have no idea what she is talking about! She made me feel like Honey Boo Boo's mom! Cmon!! 30 minutes later now I have my nails done.. but I notice that one nail is badly mangled.. she has slapped on white polish on the end and failed to file it down. It's just awful. I think if I should say anything. BUT then I think, 'I have to.. this is my $$'.. I tell her.. and she huffs.. leaves YET again.. 5-7 minutes.. and comes back.. files it down.. with 2 more I point out. I still leave with a awful, unfiled looking rough french manicure.. for the cool cost of $28 .. fill.. gel .. french. manners not included. Today I have a hang nail and its been since last Friday. My friend, however.. had a very sweet manicurist and her nails look beautiful. Her cost; $35  There are better and nicer salons SOMEWHERE out there.. My goal is still to find one!

I first ate at Roys a few years back in Honolulu... So I was pretty excited to have one here in PHX, when my job brought me to the valley. Good seafood in the valley.. Yay!  Superb service... ask away, the waiters never seem to lose patience or get snippy.. they know the product and the wines..  There isnt a thing on the menu that I dont like.. I havent tried everything.. but whenever friends from out of town come in.. This is one of my first suggestions.. My fav is the butterfish.. and the pineapple dessert.. all the other things are wonderful ... In other words... your not gonna go wrong here. Hey its Roy Yamaguchi..  for Gods sake.. and he can fuse and cook like no other..

I'm a sucker for a good market that carries fresh & inexpensive.. To a degree.. Produce.. Yum! Lots of organica.. If that's how u roll.. I don't personally, but I like healthy..& this is where I can get it.. Good meats.. Good wine department... Vitamins... Now I will say that a couple of the workers acted like they sniffed too much bulk spinache.. But they were friendly peeps.. That along with fresh.. Makes me a fan!

Loving the Pita Jungle! Almost twice a month my friends and I meet there for gossip and wine and mediterranean food.. AND the crowd reminds me a bit of DC... (silly I know!, but I love when guys are in suits at lunch! ).. hehe! ABOUT the food... Greek Salad.. if your watching your mid.. this is what I say works! Large or small .. the large too much for me.. but its a good salad. IF no dates that week! THEN 'splurge' on the Spinach Quesadilla. its on lavosh bread... and not over greasy.. their version of pico de gallo, is fresh and works with the quesadilla.. and the tsaziki is a plus.. all med cafes need an awesome tsaziki, after all its just a given! They have a full bar.. good wines.. Gazpacho rocks! AND Ive had the seared ahi with fruit salad.. YUM! the portions are big.. be prepared... :-)  NOW If I were here on a lunch hour.. idk..this place has a wait outside and in.. and its placement of tables is on the European scale (like elbow to elbow).. make friends , I guess!

Maybe it's weird that I am a girl. But I like this bar. The service is always spot on. The staff is friendly and the beer is good and cold. Has a good happy hour menu and it may be swamped with guys but I still like the Tilted Kilt for the fact that you know what your getting!

Did I end up here on a bad day.. Id only been to one other Pick Up Stix, in San Diego.. so I was hoping for more.. end of story.. nothing to report.. just go there with espresso in the system..because its sleepy.. the menu and the people were just.. eh.. the food.. they forgot my sauces for the wontons.. and the dressing for my salad.. Never noticing til I got it home.. so when I rate as , "Ive seen and had better.. " trust me.. I have

WELL I must.. AFTER much thought of reviewing this place.. I have to.. I love my doctor.. hes the best! I followed Dr. Tosca from Tempe.. AND let me tell you, when I returned from Washington DC to find he had moved from that area... I wanted to hoot and holler and raise the roof! HA! Id have him go back.. He traded hood for rude.. His staff is the rudest Ive ever experienced.. Louisa, the appointments clerk IS the ONLY one, that is friendly.. THE rest, please.. go in there and be afraid.. very afraid.. I'm lucky...I am dually insured.. OH.. maybe NOT so lucky.. I go thru H E L L every time.. THEY are hellish to me MOI for having two insurances! Scenario.. Kimberly: 'Hi ...Im here to see Dr. Tosca'.. Rude clerk lady: 'Did you sign in?" no smile.. eyes glaring.. Kimberly:'Sorry.. this is my first time here'  Rude clerk lady: silence ... stare.. Kimberly: signs in.. pushes the clipboard back.. Rude clerk lady.. slams the glass window.. not a word said..       15 minutes past appt time  a Pima Medical Institute student calls from the right: KIMBERLY M...... !!!!!! Kimberly: raises hand.. hobbles over  as Im here for a knee injury  ..Rude student: step on scale  Kimberly: 'okay...how are you today' smiling:-) Rude student: no response  'be seated im going to take your temp and your bp'  Rude student: walks away.. then looks back.. YOUR to follow ME.. Kimberly: 'okay'    You get my drift Im hoping.. this happens every time.. They are cold...glaring and not ever friendly...its as if they hate the patients.. MY goodness.. arent you happy to be working.. and working in a field where you give back??? If the Dr. has to do forms.. you will be charged a cool $30 for that.. and you will have to call a few times to get it corrected.. his clerk will call you back .. and by golly, dont expect any niceties.. not here.. not from this office.. But I go because once you get past the trauma of the rude staff girls.. the Dr. is awesome... NOW how can I find a way to advise him of this.. send him this yelp review anonymously??? Hmmmm maybe I will

I am a commuter from Seattle.. Meaning, this became my home away from home a few months ago. I stay here because many of my coworkers stay here... Lately this place has gone downhill quicker than a tumbleweed in a wind storm. The front desk acts like they are doing you a favor by checking you in.. Never a smile... Rarely a thank you.. Last month I stayed here 6 nites... The last time I had the opportunity to finally lodge a complaint. After all the card in the room totes 'Satisfaction Guaranteed'.. Joke! I had two roaches in my room.... One dead.. One live and fast. Uncatchable.. I called. I got a guy with zero energy in his blood. Kinda like that roach laying on his back dead? He said 'oh.. Well.. Ugh... Sorry.. Not my fault '... I told him about the rancid stained carpet.. The broken bent over lamps...'ok' was the response.. Calling the manager did nothing further.... This place is a dive... Know going in the 'satisfied customer'.. Won't exist here... Wifi.. That is gonna work about half the time..SO me and my buddy bidder..have found a new home away from home and away from this dive..

I love a great mojito... I lived near here so a few of us walked over one nite for mojitos.. heres the thing.. the location takes away from the place.. The bar was lively...and had it been larger..itd be a truly great place to hang.. there was salsa music and strong mojitos... Truly good cuban food... I havent been to Cuba...But it reminded me alot of Puerto Rico... where I stumbled the streets of San Juan after alot of mojitos looking for my hotel! The staff even has the accent to match:-) They are attentive... We opted to get a table because we started feeling a bit claustophobic in the bar area... it was that crowded... we had tostones... fried sweet potatoes..pasteles... arroz con pollo... a sampler plate... and then took tres leches home.. piggies we were! Worth it ...it was...

Close to home.. organic.. and fresh. All the things I need to keep me on the healthy up side.. Trader Joes is about 5 miles away.. still my favorite.. but this place is a close second. This place came as a recommendation from my doctor and Ive been going since.

A night out with my little girl was home from school  and we find ourselves at Biltmore FP wandering around. We opt into Julia Confections for a dose of sugar and coffee. We actually did not realize there was seating and desserts til we were inside. With that we sat and shared the sundae. Can we say heaven? The sundae comes in a large decadent bowl and all these sides of more decadence: hot, rich JC, fudge ; hot caramel ; nuts; chantilly cream; chocolate sprinkles. Mmmm. My little girl loved making her own bites out of her rare dose of sugar. The adults had cappuccino from the coffee bar. As if that was not enough, we left with more chocolates. The girl working was a bit overwhelmed by herself; but she was super sweet and polite and apologetic for the tardiness in serving. That goes a long way. This little piece of heaven is tucked into Biltmore and worth the stroll in. Worth the next days workout!

We run this baby ... ;-) this is where I run... to center myself.. to get my self 'back' . Some people go to the gym.. and no joke.. I do too..BUT trust me.. IF I have a choice, I would rather be outside with nature..and in PHX this is close to my home and the best I can do. It's rather safe, as I like to run at night. It's pretty lighted and friendly, in terms of other walkers and runners and what nots. No excuses.. get out.. get it done.

Gets a 5! Here is why. Right up the way from my boyfriends pad. He wanted to take me up there simply to see atop the PHX lights and a nice glass of wine on the TBones patio after I had a long, stressful day at the training center. We arrived with about 35 minutes to soak it all in. We never felt rushed and we went over the closing time. Usually when you show up with that little time to kill, the staff gives that look of, ' great one..jerks..coming into a full service restaurant so close to closing'. Nope. We got the warmest hello. Full menus...even tho we knew we both wanted two maybe two rounds of pinot noir and to do nothing more than sit on the patio and see the stars and the city lights. The owner came out and was hospitable. We even asked the waitress about a place we thot was reminiscent of T Bones in Scottsdale and she told us. This weekend we have more time from our careers and date night planned for a full dinner and a FULL bottle of red ... on the patio, of course!

My boyfriend lives down the way from T-Bones. Since I fell in love with it on first sip on the the patio after a rough day at inflight training a few weeks back.. He decided to show me the full sizzle on a Thursday night last week. We got there earlier this time. We drove up with the top down on a beautiful Arizona desert evening. The place was seriously packed! It was actually hard to find a parking place. There was a wedding rehearsal dinner party going on out on the back area.. Fun to watch from our seat on the patio. We knew we wanted to have a glass of wine or a beer or two before having dinner and just catch up from our week of travels and business before ordering dinner. However, we ordered our drinks ... got our waters and the waiter just disappeared. Again, the place was packed and he had his hands full. Literally. This night seems to also be the 'trail ride' night. Where you can ride the trail and then have dinner here. I haven't done that. Maybe in the future. My boyfriend finally walked in after we waited a good 30 minutes for our drinks and found our waiter, who very apologetically, admitted to forgetting about us out there on the patio. Really it wasn't much of a worry. As we love the ambience and the sunset was pretty. Besides, there is a reason he and I are together... there is not a boring moment between us! (okay..roll eyes.. yep.. cheesy--ness to the maximum there).. He still takes his time to come back after our glasses go empty and re-up us and then take our order. Again.. we are pretty patient. But now we are hungry! I order the filet mignon petite steak, medium rare.. comes with a salad bar and bread. I opt for a baked potato, a splurge for me, on the side. My boyfriend gets the half chicken. I am not much on salad bars, as I usually think its less sophisticated than it should be for a nice restaurant, but I liked this one. Our meals came out in a timely fashion and we got another drink in a timely fashion, once all the trail riders were back on the trail and on their way. The waiter even sat down and offered up another apology. My steak was so good! I crave steak every now and then and its about the only red meat I eat .. and only rarely. Loved my boo's chicken. So yummy.. I kept eating it! I only bring my star down from 5 because I give the waiter that not the place itself. He sort of rushed for the check to be signed off so he could have a drink and told us that if our check was left open that he could not have a drink yet.. okay buddy.. We were so, so nice and patient with your lack luster service and NOW your pushing our nice buttons...Again .. I love this place and it's fast becoming a PHX fav for me.

I always go here to this WF location after visiting my ortho doc .. I always know that I can find good berries.. items not found anywhere else. Clean store.. great cheeses. And usually a great dessert selection.. the last time I was there.. I left with a $20 dessert for a surprise dinner that I had to attend .. I get home to realize they gave me the wrong dessert!! I decided to suck it up.. but it was dry.. tasted old.. and then I considered how on crutches, post surgical by 2 weeks.. (aka pain!!).. that i waited as the ONE deli/dessert/coffee bar boy took everyone in front of me.. that came after me !! I called the manager.. and to their credit.. he said hed credit me the next time in.. Annoying..but he made good on that.. However, Im not so keen on this particular WF. Room for definate improvement.

LOVE the staff here.. LOVE the little black dresses that ALWAYS fit me.. hard to accomplish in this short petite body with a bit of curve.. I mean.. its a 2 on top and 4 in the middle.. Im a member of the club.. and they always have an incentive at checkout.. sometimes I like .. and sometimes I pass.. depends on my AmX bill that month.. I have a beautiful white trench coat from here.. too long in the arm.. but they offered to send it out for me.. Ill even drive out of my way to go to this particular store..Date dress central.. yay!

I love a good NY type pizza.. & I may just be a pizza snob., so upon moving to PHX , my friend ordered this in a pinch for caloric intake bc it was near our hotel..I've loved Rosatis ever since... I'd love for them to add some more variety to the salad selections.. But hey.. I'll take the awesome pizza & make my own salad...

I find myself back in the torture chamber of a physical therapist for a knee that won't cooperate... or an injury that keeps getting re-injured. Nonetheless, my surgeon, trying to avoid taking me back to the OR for another bout of surgery on not one knee, BUT NOW, TWO knees ( are u kidding me, THANK you MR. catering guy for leaving a wet mess on my galley floor... that and my stillettos don't play well together!)... sent me to this physical therapy center near my home. What is convenient is that it is located in the TOCA office section of the Biltmore Medical Plaza and right near my home. Awesome, since my cute torturer wants to put me thru the trials 3 times per week! I will say, as much pain as I am in initially, my PT , Sean, is professional, he talks to you about each exercise or therapy technique and explains the effect it will have on my knees. His tech is just as good. To distract me from my pain, and yes, at times, tears, he talks to me, jokes with me... and is compassionate. NOW if they can help me avoid surgery until next year .. PLEASE... I will give them a 5star:-)

BMW maintenance costs after warranty has played out.. bites..and it bites big!  I was hit by road debris on the ever debri'd I-10... my insurance sent me to BMW and then to another auto shop for the work.. Babbitt saved me hundreds. Nate is awesome.. no other words.. he knows how to get parts within hours.. hes informative & on his game..  NOW to rid myself of a car that is starting to continuously have issues.. hmmmmm   Love the Babbitt:-)

Jones'n for a bit of greek apps on a patio.. I end up here.. We got the greek sampler app plate.. Hummus was great.. but dont be so stingy with it, GP! Taziki was the same.. The pita got hard as it sat.. Maybe it had been micro'd too long.. blech.. The dolmades.. ugh.. no.. Im picky with those.. and they are my fav since I visited Greece & practically lived on them.. to avoid other things that I didnt care for.. :-) SO dont try and pass a canned tasting slimy dolmade on me.. The staff was sweet..couteous.. but thats about all Im gonna rave on..

My daughter when home from private school, adores a cupcake.. So, going against the grain of sugar filled child behavior.. I gave in & crossed the street for a bit of butter, cream and all things sugar. Let me just say, the girls working there deserve at least a dozen each day free.. they are sweet as the sweetest cupcake in the case & they seem to put up with Scottsdales, uh hmm.. finest , discerning types.. My Alexa opted for the chocolate coconut, we also got a vanilla, vanilla & a strawberry.. sooo good.. and sooo sweet..  Its cutesy, a bit pricey.. but worth all the calories and sugar!

Not so much.. great drinks.. great service... but the food and the vibe..better across the way at Postino... Bread a bit stale.. so we got a different batch.. then the same.. My friends spaghetti.. he liked..but again, better elsewhere... my artchichoke, which I ordered off the appetizer menu was burned yet the heart undercooked...how does that happen...hmmm  Great decor... great date place maybe... but then head over to Postino.. better vibe.. better wines!

So its gonna rate high in my book irregardless:-) After going on and on about how Im disappointed in the lack of breakfasty type places in PHX .. My friend from PV said I know 'The Place'.. (teehee).. The Place was packed.. but we got a booth .. friendly service.. I got the perfect poached egg.. because that is pretty much the only way I will have my eggs.. and darnit.. they better be right!.. I split a buttery pancake with my friend; So I love this place.. I mean, umm.. The Place!

Moon Valley.. I love you since moving out of the Biltmore area and heading North with my one and only:-) I have found some really great pizza places since moving here.. BUT Barros is by far.. the best.. The service at this particular Barros was awesome.. I had mistakenly called the wrong Barros for pick up.. My friend gets here and gives me that, 'wth look'.. well.. I wasnt sure of the addy, thats my excuse and Im sticking to it.. The cashier was awesome.. she said basically not to worry.. smiling.. and called in our order.. called the wrong Barros and canceled the other.. 8 minutes later.. we had a fresh, piping hot bomb pizza and a dozen wings.. life is good..now I know my friends addy and location to order from too.

Two for the Hut...I know, Im harsh..Im from the Bay Area...And Pad Thai..with shrimp...should taste like shrimp... I mean, it looked like shrimp...and it was horrid... The noodles were overcooked... the sauce wasnt saucy enough... But a star for effort... I like the soup, whatever it is, thats served prior to ordering, however note..its NOTED that you will be charged if YOU DONT place an order for that soup and fried egg roll IMMEDIATELY placed before you AS SOON as you sit... What if I dont want either??? I also ordered a chicken fried rice... It had a strong taste of coconut, too many onions and once again, overcooked rice... But the staff is nice, prompt... and on their game... So I cant go any lower than 2.. Just not feeling the need to order those two things if I do decide to visit the Hut again...

I went here last Saturday night with my boyfriend and to meet up with friends for dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by everything! From the street, this place doesn't look like much, but inside, it has a pretty cool, low lit ambience. You are carded from the moment you get to the hostess stand. It's Tempe! Don't take it personal. IF you are of the sipping age, you get a bracelet from that point so that you can partake in what else? Sake Bombing! We had several apps upon ordering. Crab puffs, ( I can't have them due to a food allergy), but they smelled awesome and were gone within 8 minutes. The cucumber salad is always a fav of mine when I am at a sushi place, and this one came with a couple of crab sticks atop. So good. For our sushi rolls, we ordered the special, Miso Sexy roll; the Firecracker Roll; The White Castle roll, (I know you expect the thing to be topped with midwestern burgers!), which was hands down, everyones favorite.. (and no... no burgers!); The usual Vegas roll; we had nigiri in salmon and tuna. Complete with sake bombers and the special of $3 raspberry vodka that you can do anyway; we did seltzer. All that for 4 people, under a $100. We walked away very full and decided that this is now our new favorite sushi place. Sometimes you just never know how surprised you may be by what isn't 'pretty' on the outside, yet amazing on the inside!

I dont want to give Auntie even a one star.. On a beautiful Saturday, my friends  wanted to go sit and have something to drink & have an app , or two. This is tops for happy hour places, that's why we chose it. We opted to sit at the bar outside.. All the tables were reserved for a shower. Every time we were spoken to.. bc no one manned the bar.. it was rudely. We got a cerveza and a marg.. at least those you cant really fail on. The salsa was horrid...& I usually love the Aunts salsa.. we ordered sopapillas.. asked to have them first.. Umm guess not.. THEY never arrived.. Our water ran empty.. our chips and not-so-much salsa ran out... THE end was when our nachos.. had a hair on top.. we told the curt waitress.. & she rolled her eyes and said sorry.. We never saw her again.. THE thing is.. I usually LOVE this place for it's patio and good food , but tonight .. .. I DONT think SO! I left with my appetite ruined.

Roka Akor came to me from one of my great friends.. when I was searching for a trendy, up place to have my best friends going away party... It didnt (nor did he!), let us down. The staff was very helpful & friendly in making sure all the details were panned out for our small--ish party of 15.. Sample tasting menus were sent to me directly... and despite the fact that we decided we would order off menu.. Im going back just to have a sample tasting menu..  Roka is decorated in a beautiful way.. its atmosphere is sweet with the cool vibe:-)  Pre-dinner drinks.. We had it all.. Saketinis.. YUM.. Sake.. I got a couple.. one hot, then one chilled.. Shochu.. (not my fav), but had to try the infused flavored Shochus..  Appetizers.. I had the Butterfish Tataki w/Asparagus.. LOVED it.. could have ordered more as my meal.. My friends had salads, etc. Note, salads are huge for a starter salad!  Main Course.. we had Toro, various sashimi, and various sushi rolls, AND Robatas.. Being from the Bay Area, Im pretty picky with my sushi/sashimi.. and I was pretty impressed :-) Next time.. Im personally going to add a Robata of kobe beef:-) BUT wont do the sweet shrimp sashimi nor the eel roll.. that actually let me down.. as well as most of our other party who tested it..  Staff was awesome, attentive and very detailed... If you have a question regarding the food or drinks.. our waiter had answers on preparation and suggested to our personal liking.  Be prepared.. the bill wont come with your budget in mind... its def pricey, but worth it..  TIP: Have a res on weekend nights for sure...:-)

I was pleasantly surprised while out at San Tan to find this place for a icy margarita and early dinner whilst the sun goes down.. Nice patio.. Perfect Patron Margs.. and a really cool prix fixe menu.. Which isnt the usual sample sizes you end up with at times with those chosen courses. AND its only about $16 for a 3 course dinner... My one thing I couldnt tolerate was the taquitos... greasy beyond belief down to the dry chicken centered within the greasy 'shell'.. Attentive waitstaff.. good food.. Bueno for the Cantina..

On Valentines night.. I was taken as a date here.. I always associate Italian...and good..NO GREAT.. Italian food .. authentic.. that is.. with love:-) .. So it's perfect ..and Aiellos delivered.. Very friendly family run restaurant.. I ordered a tre colored salad.. the vinagrette was just as I like it.. the bread was perfect.. my chicken parmigiana was huge.. and my plate runneth over with chicken.. there could have been a bit more pasta.. but thats okay... My date had veal piccata.. he had some serious order envy... his was good too.. we ordered a bottle of the Sangiovese.. and polished it.. it was one of the best wines Ive had in a restaurant.. considering some of the best Italian food I had was in Manhattan (NY).. near the theatre district.. I was seriously impressed with the wine.. to finish we shared a zabliogne.. a italian custard with berries.. Ive attempted to make this classic Italian dessert at home for a dinner party and failed ... that could have had some more berries, but again.. its rare to see on a menu here at all! I loved that the owner walked the restaurant with a game of bingo.. you guess a number between one and ninety.. and you could win dinner:-) Seriously.. Im overall impressed..

My favorite location.. It's small and it's friendly. Most MAC stores are usually busy for a reason.. most of us MAC users know the product and love the product and the staff. AND they are 'green' .. you can bring in your old 'pods' for a free lipstick! YAY for GLAM! I don't like the Scottsdale location as well, again for lack of customer care and time given. This is in and out... get your MAC and glam on pretty girls.. and guys if that is how you sway;-)

Two words.. HOW rude .. I usually go to Nordies to stock up on my Chanel makeup.. but staying out at Marks lately.. I opted to try the Macys makeup department at Paradise Village.. The Clarins lady walked up to me and wanted to seat me for a small makeover.. I politely told her , 'no thanks, but is there a Chanel counter here'.. I snootily got the 'Umm, NO..' with the roll of the eye.. alrighty then.. I will give it a 2 star.. because I loved the fact that the jeans department had more of a selection then the Joes Jeans selection at my beloved Nordies at Fashion Square.. but rudeness doesnt warrant anything more than 2 no matter how great the selection is... boo on you, Macys Clarins lady..

This review is purely for the wedding registry department alone. While searching for my friends upcoming wedding and gifts for her from her registry. Macy's has awesome  linens.. Love the Hotel Collection.. the wedding registry lady specialist made finding my friend a gift super easy..  Since I was here, I Have a specific china that they carry, just not at PV Mall.. However, she called all over the valley to find it.. So even though we didn't find this particular Villeroy and Boch pattern I've wanted for years, it's okay! This wedding registry clerk tried to help me and I'm not even the ine getting married! So off I went with some amazing linens off my friends registry and amazing customer service to boot:)

I drive from where I live near Biltmore/Arcadia to get my girly on here! Its a girly place... pink and french tapestry decor.. and you know what, (rolling eyes!), it matters! They do a great job.. bottled waters while you get your 'pink' on... and I dont find the prices to be much more than any other junk place you may stroll into.. trust me, after all my days of being a girly girl... Ive had bad manis and pedis.. and its not a good thing when they nick you and dont apologize! And you hurt for days with a swollen cuticle! They do this gel-acrylic nail gel, called Pink.. white tips, pink (but not overly) on the nail bed...looks soo nice.. and a good french mani on the feet... and that just leaves me a happy girl...so I can pop my Jimmy Choos on and go without freaking out over ugly toe--ness!

I have yet to find any nail salon in Phoenix or Scottsdale that I like as much as Pink. I drive out of my way to come here and usually try and call ahead, as no matter the time of day, it's busy. No matter, I've never had shoddy service. The techs are nice and always professional. I've taken my little girl here too and I always want to be seated next to her to be sure no one tries to 'up sell' her when I'm not around, even if I'm a little ways 'away', that hasn't happened, as it has at other salons in the valley. Pink always has the latest OPI and best gels on hand, so if you happen to know of a color you have seen somewhere , ( say on Pinterest, as where I find all mine!), they have them! Best thing.. They last! My mani and my pedi always last a minimum of 3 weeks & for someone like me, I don't LOVE getting my nails done , because I just don't have time to sit for an hour half plus on my days off! When it lasts , I'm happy. This place is cute, clean and friendly... Worth a little more and worth the trip!

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya.. Bermuda, Bahama   If you want any type of rum from any of the above, cmon on pretty mama.. You DON'T have to go to Kokomo.. BUT, if you or you're AmX is really pretty, there is a 50 year old Appleton Estate Rum for $2500 per. Now, if your pocket book isn't feeling oh-so Hemingway, The Breadfruit claims to have the most extensive Rum menu in all of Arizona.. and after seeing it for myself, I happen to believe this claim. The drinks here are all worthy starting as described by our attentive waiter as 'fruit forward' to more 'heavy and serious' and after dinner as the drink menu follows on. The bartenders at The Breadfruit have a romance with rum, which is regarded as the most versatile spirit. There is a Rum Punch of the day. The evening we were there, it was a light, fruity, rum concoction of hibiscus and roasted smoked pineapple. The punch carried PUNCH. Do not come expecting a full wine list here, as there are only two from Southern Arizona. This is a Rum Bar. Be prepared to take an Uber. :-) The next drink I had for dinner, in lieu of wine, was a Velvet and Vinyl. This drink was almost too pretty to drink! The waiter delivered this deep pink to red libation to my table in a beautiful little glass, don't be fooled by its beauty. On first sip, I decided to do just that: sip it. The Velvet and Vinyl is a beauty of Appleton Estate VX Rum, hibiscus liquor, (which is house made!), ginger, pineapple, lime, bitters and a touch of rose mist. If you are the DD on your night here, don't worry, there are nice libations that carry sans alcohol for you too!   Key Largo, baby why don't we go to Kokomo?   Speaking of Kokomo. If you have ever been in the Florida Keys and had a corn fritter than you will appreciate some of Breadfruits appetizers. We noshed on the delicious Salt Fish Fritter. It was a flat fritter of cod fish served with a creme fraiche of dill and coconut. There are two served warm on a plate and a good way to offset some of that rum before dinner.   Montego.. why don't we go, Jamaica.   Jamaican Jerk..  The Breadfruit and Rum Bar has that too. For dinner, I had the Jerk Pork and Polenta: a slowly smoked pork shoulder that had been marinated in rum, (what else?), jerk rub and smoked over pimento woods and served over tasty warm polenta and seasonal farm vegetables. The pork is more of a pulled type dish over the polenta. My date, my husband, also wanted to relive our vacation to the Caribbean with some tastes of jerk and rum and opted for the Pimento Wood Jerk Chicken, which was a HUGE serving of game hen smoked over pimento wood, rubbed with house jerk rub and served over rice and small peas. This dish had some spice to it! It comes as a hen on a bone and was amazing! The table of us being 6 had various plates that included the Blue Mountain Curried Goat over Basmati Rice and it was said to be yummy and tender and looked like a generous portion. The Guava Glazed Pork Belly was also ordered on our table and there were about 5-6 slices of the Pork Belly two being super fatty with not much meat, which can happen with pork belly and one reason, I personally don't order it. Our friends ordered a dessert to share and for $9 it was a super small ramekin of dessert which is a little on the pricey side to me. Whereas, I felt the rest of the menu was on point for pricing. The menu is ever changing and uses local farms and sources such as Mayas Farms, 2 Wash Ranch, Pillsbury Wines and The Meat Shop , JUST to name a few.   A couple of things to know. The Breadfruit and Rum Bar is small. Make a reservation if you are having dinner. We had a party of 6 for our monthly little dinner club and were asked to secure with a credit card. They will confirm on the day of the reservation and I like that. There was a mix up with our reservation when we arrived despite the confirmation via telephone earlier in the day for what was to be a half and hour later than was logged into the reservation system when we arrived, SO I am glad we decided to arrive early for a drink! There was also some confusion over wanting a drink at the bar and the girl wanting to take us out to the cigar area patio out back. It all worked out and I didn't care either way because we ended up loving our waiter who carried us through the first drink to the last drink after our dinner was served. Parking is somewhat a bear in this area, also. Allow time for that! The patio, should you want to sit out there for the Cigar and Rum Manifest, ( a separate menu all its own!), has patio heaters for the winter and is expansive.   Our service , (from order to getting entrees) , was slow but my husband and I don't mind that after having lived in France and knowing that food is what makes social times the best ! The wait staff made up for the slowness ten fold anyway.    Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo...  (Well, at least if you order that Appleton Estate Vintage, you will :) ) ...

Seriously if your Jones' n for anything remotely healthy..or to take on your flight , because no airline caters coach 100%.. & even if that pre 9-11 perk does come back.. Just say eh eh., no... The B B is open early & crew members love this place. You can get vegetarian Mexican fare, and they will foil it for you for the trip.. I always get a vegetarian breakfast burrito..& after I'm done being fly sky godess.. I have it & usually warm.. So for airport cuisine.. This is pretty 'fly'..   Ps.. Located in T4 , near high A gates.. :-)

I am in love with the herbed baguette ! Finally I can have a bread that tastes good ! I love that there are now 3 locations in the valley for those of us who have a myriad of food allergies. All of the breads and etc. are frozen. But yummy, nonetheless. THE only thing I have not loved is the plain baguette. I got one for a Jeep outing with my boyfriend, and it was crumbling in our hands when we made our sandwiches on the trail. The herbed baguette is awesome. As is the herbed pizza crusts; calzones and cinnamon rolls. MMMMM.. such a treat for a food allergie'd person like me. The staff is so helpful and there is also a punch card for your purchases. I am just happy to have this bakery for options!

My words can't express my love for Road Runner Sports! I used to love them when they were only online! NOW I am loving that I can buy them in the real live flesh.. ummm.. leather.. or whatever.  It was time to revamp my running gear. I needed new runners. I head to Tempe Marketplace to the mecca of RR. There is some sort of Adventure Run going on. I'm a little jelly that I am not in it. But after a year plus injury it may take me awhile to be that good again. I get a sales associate named , Amber. She puts me on the 'Shoe Dog' right away and lets me know what my foot needs in a running shoe. I have a very high arch. She takes the time and I end up with a jazzy looking Adidas lightweight running shoe and a train load of Under Armour. I re-up my VIP club, which for $20, is worth it. With it you get a , "Wear 90 days and return guarantee". Free shipping, if you need to order from Road Runner.. just as a few perks.  My first run with my new Adidas was not good. My heel is very narrow and I ended up walking back from my run limping. Awful. NO run the next day because I had huge blisters on my heels. Day 3, I tried again on a treadmill. Nope. Same thing. When I landed back in PHX, I went back to RR and no questions asked. Amber put me into another shoe. A Mizuno , after trying on several others and telling me the ones I liked, (purely based on colors ! ), were all wrong for my foot. I even asked if I could just place something in the heels of the Adidas to help me and she said I had the smallest Adidas and it would not serve me well on my runs. I did opt for the Mizuno , a pricier running shoe. No worries. They matched the price, even though I never would have expected that. Amber is an awesome sales girl, as all the staff is. Patient and very knowledgable about sports and fitness. Even races in the area. I can't say enough about this store and how worth the drive it is!

Sorry..not much here I can give a plus to.. I do like the margaritas..so I can give a star or two.. I do love the chips...the little dips that you get prior to ordering...My one thing is that.. is that the dip crock is so small..that you have to continuously try and catch the waiter...I a bit of a chip muncher..salsa, and dip lover... So I have had the cheese crisp with a few extras on the side.. My parents were here and wanting some 'good ' mexican food... My mom, hated it... oops! Guess Ill pay attention to yelp before I do that again... I like that the food is New Mexican 'style' with green chile type dishes...but I have yet to be impressed with the enchiladas...or the tacos...or the food, in general. Service is blah..and inconsistent... starting from the moment you walk in to the 'dressed up' hostesses with attitude..but margs are good, strong..and the chips and salsas are good.. not great..good

I adore Maizie's. Good burgers.. and drinks. Sit at the bar and you will be well taken care of. The last time I was there, I had a watermelon vodka spritzer.. ONE.. ONE..and I was done. The bartender is always so nice..happy.. and recommends what she has had and likes. THAT is a plus to me. Laid back and trendy. Good date spot..or friends hanging spot.

The Wynn Encore is my new favorite hotel while in Las Vegas. Recently I accompanied my boyfriend on a trip over the weekend and we opted for the Encore over The Wynn to try it out. The rate for a weekend at this amazing place was very good. They do have a rate guarantee if you book on the Wynn site, FYI. That includes an upgrade, and a price match. On check in, we had a bit of a line at the check in desk. But the staff was more than apologetic and kind to us on check in. We had booked a suite and it was upgraded to a panoramic view suite. I had just had surgery on my spine earlier that week and the check in girl offered to send up a refrigerator for my ice packs needed for my recovery. I know, spine surgery recovery in Vegas ??? Well, a suite at The Wynn Encore makes it a perfect place. It's truly a 5 star experience. The rooms in Vegas on a weekend can be noise intrusive from the halls. This room is sound proof; the only exception is our room was 39 floors up and we could hear the Deadmau5 party below both weekend nights bumping until about 0500am; I only know because I was up to medicate myself! The room was a spacious suite; two separate rooms and a bathroom suite with soaking tub and separate water closet. Little touches like touch control shades , drapes, night lights that dimly light the hall and bath area for night and EVEN the 'do not disturb' or 'make up room' are done via touch control. We ordered room service on our Saturday here; my love wanted a Wynn Signature Bloody Mary; no alcohol allowed for me, so I wanted a nonfat cappuccino service. The room service attendant, Diane, arrived about 30 minutes later , ( it's a huge hotel and I imagine room service in Vegas on a weekend is slammed), and had my steamed, frothed milk and espresso in separate canisters to keep hot. His Bloody Mary was hand shaken and mixed by Diane. She was friendly and on top of her game. Steve Wynn must appreciate his guests to make sure his staff is that attentive to the needs of the guest . We tried to add an extra tip to her check and she said , 'No! It's all inclusive in your bill'; that's never heard of. We dined at a few of the restaurants on Wynn/Encore property. One thing to remember: this is a 5star property to 'compete' with 'the best of the strip' , The Venetian; The Bellagio. You are gonna shell out some dollars by being here. The 2$ restaurant will run you close to $100 and the drinks in the lobby bar average $14 plus. It's not for coming to Las Vegas on a budget. If that's your thing , stay at a lower rated property. Everything here is beautiful; floral everywhere; high end shopping , like Fendi and Dior!!! I die! Great people watching from most places that are public : our place for my boo to have a night cap was the Lobby Bar. The typical club pretty's all shiny and drunk are fun to watch going to and from the clubs on property! Yes. Even The Wynn has drunk girls and guys and that's always fun entertainment; it's even better because I could not drink this time! The pool was wall to wall and closes early, in my opinion, to set up for the clubbing crowd. One pool staying open for adults would not be a bad idea. The staff manning the pool were also on their game, attentive and nice. Another note, not many children. Sorry. We like that. Our travel mates were down the strip further at a popular hotel, and the children running around the pool and common areas was beyond annoying; kids in Vegas???? Return factor , MINUS a surgery recovery, all in:-) I love this place .. More than The Venetian and more than The Bellagio. Next time I will stay a bit longer ; enjoy the spa and more of the food when I feel 100%.

I think this may win the best pizza I've had in Phoenix since taking a job here in 2006! We did take out & got two vegetarian choices. One was a Venice with artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, goat cheese..& was a small piece of Italian heaven in my mouth. I loved the Chicago style crust... Yum! My friends raved about this place close to our neighborhood.. I'm now a fan...& I'll drive a bit further to get what I know is close to perfect:-)

Ohhh Starbucks... this location needs ALOT of work. I frequent this location often, DESPITE how I always tell myself to drive further and go somewhere else.. I usually end up here because it's near. They are slower than molasses in freezing weather IN Maine! Because I have ended up multiple times with the wrong drink order via the drive up OR that it's always , ( any time of the day), got a LONG line and with that, a LONGER than usual wait time, I try and gauge the drive up length versus parking and pulling my lazy self out and walking inside to order. The last visit I had, for example, I parked, went inside and there was no line... the drive thru had no less than 8 vehicles waiting. I had my order taken immediately. I stick with what is on the menu here and make it my goal to not order anything crazy : 220* Capps or extra froth, for example.. I don't want to throw these guys off with what I know isn't that difficult BUT here, it seems to be. I stood waiting for a basic, nonfat, caramel macchiato for almost 20 minutes.. they forgot about my order. Finally I was asked by one of the several baristas if I was still waiting. He admitted they 'somehow' skipped me. Thankfully, I'm pretty patient. The other barista, a girl, gave me my now prepared drink. You know what , it was a latte. She also shortened my name .. with a wink? What? (KIM is my pet peeve ..& the name on the cup clearly states Kimberly :) .. ) Oh well. I had places to get to and it wasn't worth correcting my name , or my drink or advising these many baristas that the drink bar was a mess of spilled stuff.. sugars missing and empty canisters or half and half. I simply continue to frequent this particular location in hopes that because this part of S PHX has not much by way of restaurants or coffee places, this location will get its act together: you know the basics ? Clean the place more often , be quicker with simple menu offered drinks, be friendly, get the drinks correct and be apologetic for wronging a customer, not smarty! I'm holding out hope.. because I'm on about my 150th visit here and 3/4 times its the wrong something ! Americans and our coffees:)

Not really a fan of this Sbux. Just sayin. I feel coffee should not be a hard thing nor should it take me so long to get . However, it's right down the way from my boyfriends and thus, convenient. Let's face it, when you need java, it's needed now. NOT in 15 minutes from ordering. Two things recently, on my way to my campus, very early in the morning, I ordered a quad nonfat dry Cappuccino. Doesn't seem that difficult, right. I start to walk out and realize it's a sugary, mocha sort of thing. Spat!! Ewww. No. I don't like chocolate that much and I hate sugar more. This drink I waited on for 10 minutes; my bf had his Americano and was having to leave me or he was gonna be late for a meeting ! She almost sneered at me when I told her the coffee was not what I ordered. Oh well. 5 more minutes and correct Capp. In hand ; wow maybe the baristas need more java?? Secondly, I splurged on a quad nonfat caramel latte and it's coming out to me as a frap? Hmmmm. What? Did I say 'cold'? Why no I did not.. More attitude. So there is my justification for 2 stars ... You see in this side of town... There's just no Peets!

Not a fan. Crowded.. Can't get to the dance floor.. Some girl in the shortest, tightest shorts dancing the SAME grind while 60 year olds stare ... mmm??? Bathrooms in bars like this.. No words. It's a story amongst stories. The later the night gets.. the better it becomes.. Took me 20 minutes to get from point A to point complete in the womens restroom.. As I waited.. the random youngster runs past line.. holding mouth... random friend following youngster runs after her. Girl behind me bumps me..says some 'mf' stole her jacket while she road the bull.. Did I see? ( No cougar ville.. I saw ur butt tho hanging for the world to see while u tried to ride some mechanical bull... G O A W A Y).. attendant.. curses at puking girl.. I just want to use the restroom.. AND leave . Fast. NOT my place..

BEST bartender in the Carolinas ! TODD at the bar... LOVE him.. My long lost boo took me here on our first date .... We sat at the bar and had Todd whip up one of my fav drinks that I frequent out west... a Snakebite... He made those for me all nite.. and asked if I was sure that I really liked them.. IT was enuf to make us come back EVERY nite to pregame when I am in Charlotte with my boyfriend...Live music on the weekends.. get there early enuf to get that bar stool and talk to Todd.. No joke.. He will take care of you in the end.. :-)

THE W Hotel is lucky to recieve 2stars from me considering.. OKAY since when does Starwood run a hotel like a nightclub.. with some creepy, slimy wannabes watching the velvet rope...the usual, pretties in, some guys and averages-- may have to work for it..just to be told no.. The creepy rope boy actually pulled my friend and I out of the line and whisked us in....in a weird way bc he only said a few things that I couldnt comprehend into my hair!, Who he was talking to whom in his headset!? haha.. so weird... so important Im sure..THIS after I watched the velvet rope boys tell this couple in front of me that they were at capacity... the couple sheepishly left.. how mean is that? I have been 'out' at the W... BOTH with my guys, or with the girls, or with a mix a both.. I will tell you that the rope guys let me and 2 out of my group of 5 in.. an hour later, up at Shade, my other friends arrive.. but pissed off AND ready to go to another place to throw down dollars on drinks or a table.. NOTE: You dont need a table at Shade.. its wide open.. Its a cool area, usually decent music...  AS a hotel guest.. I spent my birthday weekend here.. a stay-cation that included 2nites... VIP passes to Scottdales 'hottest' clubs.. a few drinks at Shade, etc. etc... Good deal..I had two rooms. BUT our rooms were smallish, in comparison to the W in NYC and San Diego.. and the bathroom is kind of in the open.. I love the decor though.. Problem with the ipod dock.. called, got nothing.. They said theyd bring another.. but they didnt.. Got into the shower, the entire handle fell off ...and it OUCHED my foot!! Okay.. I showered...we were late for dinner! But wasnt able to adjust the lukewarm water at that point.. Called and requested a new room.. but the hotel was 'full' so they couldnt move us.. Maintenance came at some point while we were out that nite...Concierge.. so, so.. Alyssa on the nice side.. she seemed helpful, as we requested our VIP listings.. but was supposed to call me back with confirmations, and didnt. When I called I got a different concierge, he was curt as it gets. Without a clue as to what lists we were on... He ended up having to call my cell to at that point telling me that Junkie wanted us there by 10p.. or our VIP would cancel.. Idk if thats really the concierges fault.. but NO one eventually getting my AmX is telling me to be at a bar at said time.. I do blame both concierge's for not communicating and being a bit nicer.. Hello! Bad economy=be happy for your job and respect your clientele... After dinner and all of our clubs.. our party ended up back at W for Shade.. here we go again with the ropes, the second rope to get upstairs.. show the key card, yada yada.. done.. except a couple of us didnt bring our key cards... OOOPS..NOW your gonna deal with the overproducted hair boy at the rope! OMG..stop with the marketing and let people in...it was after midnite! AND hello... this isnt NY or LA.. (sorry Scottsdale)... its the damn desert!  The next morning I had a res for day beds.. those come 2 to a room and you may grace the day bed presence for a period of time.. AND the res for that , as told by our 'friendly' concierge.. was needed a day before.. as in, upon check in.. The food isnt great...but its def overpriced.. Did like the unique drinks for the 'day after'...  I will say, I love the pool... it was a party for sure.. the attendants are sweet, attentive.. Well, until your to leave the day bed... :-)  NOW heres where the dicey becomes sheisty... AFTER checking out..I recieved a survey  from the W itself... Okay, I never fill out these things.. but figuring that I am a Starwood member , they may want to know there were issues on our rooms...UPON recieving my survey, the manager contacted me with an apology and an invite back to a cabana and bottle compliments of he... WOW... points scored... I thought Id 'save' the cabana deal for a later part of summer... hello! PHX heat! When I recently went to 'cash in' on my cabana... the manager couldnt even call me back.. his points now zero..and he made The W look bad and hit the lowbag style of lows... bad business...very poor management of a hotel being run like 'the place to get your drink on 24/7'....not sure the average business man really wants that.. but for us and our weekend..we knew we did..and booked there..  OKAY...on the clerks that check you in 5stars..  Decor=5stars Bliss Spa=5stars Bellman=3stars... dropped bags when delivering Parking=0stars... its only valet @26 a day Concierge=2stars Shade @ nite=3stars Shade pool (day)=4stars.. Shade pool attendants=5stars Velvet rope creepers=FAIL RoomService=3stars for being sweet and prompt..but club soda for a tiny bottle (size not mentioned on menu)..@$5 each... wow Manager=NEGATIVE stars...  Will I return?? Probably not.. its not that special to put up with that treatment...

Every now and then my company does me a solid .. I get to be home and get paid to be here. I usually go home to my own bed, but this time, since my husband had conferences at another hotel, I asked him to join me for the next thirty hours here and make a date night out of it. I mean, I am getting paid for this and it's a great hotel in a great part of Phoenix! The location is superb. You are close to Chase Field here and conventions and conferences take place all around. The lobby has infused water stations, which is a nice touch in hot, dry Arizona. You must have a guest room key to access any of the guest room floors. I like that. I wish ALL hotels that I stayed in around the world were like that! The rooms are decent sized, quiet and the beds are super comfortable with plush pillows. Like all Sheratons, you can count on Starbucks and Keurig too in your room. My room also had a great view of the city. The awesome gym here overlooks the olympic sized pool. The hotel restaurant, District, has a great bar with awesome happy hour specials. District, itself is also a very good restaurant for a 'hotel restaurant' using fresh herbs from the garden they have on property. In the morning, there is a large buffet breakfast served, as well. Or Starbucks to grab and go. My husband valeted the vehicle and as long as you have a meal here, your ticket will be validated and that will be complimentary. All in all, this Sheraton is in the mecca of downtown. You can walk to anything that you need or want or have to be at for business and the ASU downtown campus isn't far away, either. I found the staff here to be friendly, helpful and accommodating.

After weeks of being mom to a new puppy and being made crazy ... Low & behold near my neighborhood is Second Home Pet Resort.. Truly, this place is a dream for the naughty Airedale & me.. They have a waterpark for mans best friend, exercise equipment.. A small bowser shop for the couture pup. The staff is nice, loves dogs, & knowledgable. You will need to have current shots, & an assessment to be sure your dog isn't the one man, one dog type.. Aka anti-social. They will gladly give you a tour.. Besides doggie daycare, there are pet suites with private patios, webcams & even plasma tvs! Seriously, this place is a resort.. A five star for the furry:-)

I must admit.. Im not much of a tea person.. but a few weeks back while at Biltmore, the friendly Teavana girl gave my friend a sample of Jasmine Tea with a bit of strawberry essence.. I had a sip of hers.. all the while thinking.. 'Im not a tea girl'.. I walked away from that day wishing I had that tea.. So today, I decide to become a tea person.. I scored a beautiful Asian teapot and some of the best tea leaves ... Friendly service.. but that was from 'my' girl.. I didnt find the other two that friendly.. but I will add, they know their leaves.. now work on the friendly part when someone is dropping $20 on a small tin of tea.. and you have a 5

Im a sucker for a sweet cupcake.. OKAY my favorite cupcakery is still in Cali.. but Butter&Me is pretty high up on my list..  Kelly was awesome to work with.. I needed a quick 2 dozen cupcakes on short notice for my best friends going away party... Kelly called and wanted to appease me in any way for my besties cakes, everything from the fillings, (I chose vanilla cake with a lemon curd filling to honor my friends move to England:-) & a dark chocolate with buttercream.. Cute little flowers and edible glitters on all..:-) done with my besties fav colors...  OKAY NOT Kellys fault, BUT I wanted more of a variety of flavors in the 2doz I ordered, but that wasnt possible ... and pricing for a dozen should be a bit less, as in a bulk pricing for over 8, idk, just an idea!  Nonetheless, free delivery to our Scottsdale dinner party ... and presentation was awesome.. and as I stated, Kelly is wonderful to work with!

I was so happy to see a seemingly cool, yet upscaley type ultra bar in Phoenix.... My friend, a non average, non clubby, 30+ year old doctor. in Scottsdale and I are a bit tired of venturing out into the land of plastics-dale., (jussayin).. for an ultra lounge so we can actually catch up without screaming or dodging hands or spilled cheap vodka... SO he drives over to 'my area'  and recommends Hannys.. heres the catch.. parking can be a trick...but I lived in cities far worse.. so we walk a bit...so what? No lines... no creepy, weird velvet rope guys leaving half my party out to get in...WHAT???? Inside Hannys, the place has high ceilings and is super cool.... we sat at the bar, but there are low couches and chairs surrounding small tables for that loungey feel. I was happy to find a Kir Royale... you dont see those much in these parts.. AND it wasnt made with a American sparkling wine... but rather a French champagne! We had a antipasto platter of dried meats and cheeses... chatted with the super nice and highly articulate bartender.. even comp'd us a martini that we didnt quite 'understand'... he just said, 'try it' .. Theres a DJ and he spins cool music that doesnt over power you..and you dont even have to yell to be heard over the music... bathrooms are up stairs... and thats kind of cool too... have your date walk you up... and look down... go there.. you'll know what I mean....

I really loved this restaurant on our first night at The Wynn. We wanted something not too heavy yet trendy and hip, modern food with an exciting menu. We got right in about 730pm for dinner. The decor is paisley and striped; regal and upscale/upbeat. Very 'Wynn--esque'. My mom had a Cosmo to start and my boyfriend a blackberry margarita, that was muddled with fresh berries. I only had a taste of his drink, as I could not drink on this weekend. It was fresh and light. Just what one needs as a pre-dinner cocktail in Las Vegas. I ordered a watermelon/cheese/balsamic salad to start; I wasn't sure I could eat much more. For a 'salad', it was an ample amount. I loved it so much, I'm gonna try and mimic it at home. It was perfect for the taste buds. My boyfriend started with tomato soup; since I'm not really a tomato soup fan, I did not have an opinion, but he raved about it. My mom had a Caesar salad and loved the lightness of it; not heavy on dressing, which seems to be usual on this salad at other places. We split a charcuterie board that was loaded with fresh, sliced baguette ; four cheeses and three meats including a pate and prosciutto and salami. It came with a mustard, orange chutney; olives and pickles. Between us, we were unable to finish it. At $29 for the board, it's well worth it! The menu has a prix fixe option; had we been into a more robust meal, we would have tried it out; it was a steal for 3 courses at $42. Our service was nice and at times, a little slow ; but we enjoy being foodies and not being rushed, so it didn't bother us a bit! It's considered a 2$ sign for The Wynn; a good way to have trendy, hip meal without breaking the rest of the budget.

After trying on new jeans down the way.. my group was in the mood for Mexican food.. UGH! NOOO! Ive got Hudson jeans I must fit in to! I love the decor.. The staff was friendly.. The food.. was, so so.. I found the chips on the greasy.. as in.. greasy fingers side.. The salsa was great.. and my enchiladas were nothing amazing.. almost watery. I dont think its nice to have to ask for app plates for my chips and salsa.. but we had to, because I thot it was ridiculous to be using napkins!  Our waiter seemed off kilter when asked to split the check.. oh well.. so-so.. is a 2 too..

A recent discovery to my home near Biltmore. Drive 6 to 8 minutes and you can have some green in the desert. A little active greenery, if you will. You can go for miles of parks and lakes. A little golf happening. Run or stroll the paths. I like to run in the evening and it's refreshing to feel relatively safe here with all the people around. It's very well maintained and a way to mix up the old gym when it's too hot to go out in the sun generally.. THE reason I do night running outside. Know though before you strap on your ipod and phones into your ear to be in the right lane for good manners of the outdoor athletes.. You may find a bike horn scaring you out of your green serentity.

My friends all rave about this place.. I love a great hard cider that I tried in Ireland once called Strongbow. We were on our way to a dance performance downtown, we dodged into Turf for a hard cider and quick bite.. We never left! Fun place... casual.. good music (live folksy band).. and of course, awesome  cider... We all shared the fish&chips.. being from a coastal/beach town in Cali, I cant say I loved the fish & chips.. but since all other things were awesome with a friends night out ..Its still a 4 in my book..

Before a Suns game.. we decide to head to Turf for a bit of pregame fatty grub and cider.. Hit the spot.. Do I love love this place.. umm no.. but my friend does. It is a good place to pre-game the game; has decent drink specials and bar food .. So Ill have to always rate it high for the fun of it.

Recently met up with friends on a Saturday afternoon for mimosas and $5 wines. I had not been to this location! Postino Arcadia is my hang out. Gotta say.. I like this one as much! Well, minus the valet dealio. But really there is not much space to do much with. I am such a fan of Postino bruschettas..I raved about them to my boyfriend for months before I got him in here on this particular Saturday. So, instead of him letting me shine my bruschetta knowledge on him..somehow he tells the waiter he wants a mix up and before I could intervene.. the waiter is off and brings us a variety of bruschetta he chose. NOT what I would have chose. But okay. Sometimes I like to be controlling. I am working on that;-) We gobbled that one board down.. and we order another.. Always my favs, of course, (there's that Postino bruschetta knowledge and control thing again!), salami pesto; tomato jam/sheeps milk cheese;roasted peppers/goat cheese; proscuitto/fig/mascarpone cheese.. yum. I wish that Postino would let the customers fill out a card though on 'ideas' for bruschettas. I'd love to see a hot jam with a goat cheese. Or a pancetta and sharper cheese like a french salut or even a sheep's milk cheese. I am never, ever disappointed with Postino. Not.Ever. Great salads. Paninis. Adore the cheese board. Love the $5 wine hours on the daily and the mimosas too. Now I have my boyfriend loving it and thankfully, there are enough brews on tap that he likes should it not be a wine day for him.

I have been going here for more than 5 years. I always see Candace, the Nurse Practitioner. Love her! I am usually able to get in within a day or so and the staff is polite and professional and above all, helpful. I have had migraine shots here when they get so bad I can't barely move and all the other issues that ail ya. I almost feel that Candace has become a part of my circle of friends and family. It is a drive for me, as it's in Gilbert. But having a great medical staff for general needs is super important.

I drive by Luci's so much and I finally got to try it last week. I wish I had popped into here sooner! Luci's is all things fresh with a tad of 'just in case' .. that would be the beer and wine in the cooler that they offer, or all the cool gifts, gadgets and even chocolates and candy to browse or buy in the marketplace that is sort of housed around the seating. The concept is simple. You order at the counter, grab your table with your number and they deliver your order a short while later. Luci's is hipster and cool and such a great place for a simple coffee or tea; freshly blended juice or smoothie;  a salad, sandwich, breakfast or like I said above, a  grab and sit beer or wine. The day that I was in, with my hiking mate, I somehow managed to beat the maniac lunch rush and got a high top table at the window. I ordered the ever fresh made to order, " Chop Chop Cobb Salad, a light mix of spinach and seasonal squash, diced tomato, roasted turkey, applewood smoked bacon, red onion and marinated artichoke hearts. All topped with a home made bleu cheese pesto dressing. My daughter, ordered the Tuna Nicosia Salad. This salad was also fresh and yummy. It was made with fresh albacore tuna salad and served over mixed greens, with cucumber, tomato, a few green beans, a little hardboiled egg, red potato, red onion and olives and finished off with a light citrusy vinaigrette. Both of our salads were super filling and good! My salad was so loaded with bacon, I pulled some of it off! Luci's offers gluten free items on the menu, as well as ordering online, in case you are in a rush.. order before you go! I also noticed that Luci's serves breakfast all day and has a different special every day! Parking can be a mess here.. I will give that to where its located! So planning to dine here will take just that... some planning to beat the rush of morning or lunch. But albeit that, the service is happy, great and with a smile! The food is fresh, healthy and lovely. Since the food is so healthy, you can splurge on that other stuff!

SOOOO I got injured after flying a long 5 day trip last year.. and my ortho surgeon and my physical therapist both feel my running days are past me... ha! Both think I need to just stick with an elliptical.. Okay.. Ill think about it.. As I look at the jiggle making its way up my short dwarf legs.. Im thinking more and more .. I tried running a trail and my knees were throbbing.. wahhh! Where is my youth going?? SO down to Dicks I go after the disaster at Sports Authority where no one helps with $1000 machines..?.. Well Dicks has their own trainers in that expensive section. I was lucky and got Teejay. He knew his ellipticals. He showed me the Proform, the Livestrong, (I personally have a crush on Lance since seeing him win twice in Paris!), and Sole. His wife has the same knee issues as I and that made me feel Im not alone in missing my running days. Now! I didnt throw down the $1k plus on the elliptical quite then, but if and when I do, I wont be at the sucky Sports Authority, I will be at Dicks with the good sales and trainers who know the products. They have a good section of running shoes too... For when I do go against my surgeon and get out on the trail! ;-)

Today I fell in love.. The Parlor is what I love...all things fresh...in a clean little enclave on Camelback.. The waiter was friendly.. as my friend and I wanted to know about the meat/cheese selection on the app menu.. It just wasnt a real clear thing to us! Call me blonde or???? Nonetheless.. he recommended a few things.. all the while smiling and friendly.. We opted for the meat/cheese app before our salads.. choosing proscuitto, dried salami.. goat cheese and a sheeps milk cheese.. it comes with a warm garlicky buttery sensational flatbread and two sauces.. one is a tomatoe type jam.. the other a pesto.. highly recommend this app! NOW my one suggestion is to add more selection to the cheeses.. I lived in France.. I love a good cheese board! Watering of the tastebuds as I remember ...  Salads.. I had the harvest greens.. roasted, shredded chicken, pears, candied pecans.. gorganzola.. yum! My friend opted for the norm Caesar.. but it looked divine..  Decor is cute.. trendy..clean.. Im going back for pizza and wine on date night and hanging on the patio near that fireplace:-)

Cas on the date night pizza Parlor. This is the place. I love this Camelback place. Has a cute outdoor fireplace. Cool microbrews; nice wines. Best part... trendy eats. Antipasto...meat and cheese platters. All things I love on date nights. Pizzas are singular, in case your down with the funghi and he's all in for the meaty. Sandwiches, pastas, salads are very robust. Cut to dessert..or don't.. like me.. I drink my wine for dessert.  Awesome staff to recommend what you may or may not know. No rush service. Trendy, vibrant ambience. Lively like it should be for the trendy area it is.  So yummy. I was a pig pigster and ordered an extra singledom and took one home last time for the next day!

This hotel I used to love...It has proceeded to get worse and worse with each visit. The last time I came in on a redeye, the rooms were not even ready. The pilot on our flight, as less than enthuised when the cheerful manager offered us a breakfast voucher. Advising her that after flying all night none of us were truly hungry for some buffet breakfast, but we just wanted our beds and a hot shower. She then ante'd up a dinner voucher. Nonetheless, we waited almost 45 minutes for our rooms. There are always, ALWAYS, issues with the hotel shuttle..its late..too full... something.. Always! I found the hotel clerks to be rude when we tried to use our vouchers that nite, as the cafe questioned it. THEN took more than 40 minutes to get a sandwiche and soup ready. It started to feel like a joke on the flight crew. I can't really ever get the internet to work in the rooms. But I do like the gym. I have to say something positive.

And... These nice guys don't.. They gave me a punch card.. They were nice bc I actually get a bit of anxiety trying to get the strait on strait w my tires as I'm directed to drive strait to start the process.. They usually giggle a bit.. Which I find endearing:-) free vacs..& a punch card for a free wash.. Uh huh, that's right!

Don't let the long lines take away from your want , your need for legit coffee! Dutch Bros has that down with efficiency like no other! In my 'hood', I am very sad to say, NO Dutch exists... DOUBLE sad face!!! So there are times, like today, where it calls for a drive across town to find some amazing-ness. Enter Jeep, enter top down and away we go! Yes. There was the usual line , BUT, there is also the super friendly girl who is out there taking orders so one doesn't have to wait too long! Have you never tasted the Dutch to your caffeine wanting lips? No worries! These efficient efficients of friendly, smiling employees will guide you thru the menu. I swear you leave here wishing they were a part of your inner circle. :-) Today my pleasure was a Coco... iced and large! Oh and to make me feel better about all of my last week in an exotic location splurges, I got nonfat milk. Speaking of that: Dutch Bros. has all types of milks and can do what ever you want with their drinks. Sublime. You know it's said that if their is goodness, there is sometimes lots of people waiting. That said , no matter the line... it's quicker than that other 'popular' coffee place you wait in line for and its way , WAY better coffee!

Kareys Kitchen...a new takeout fusion restaurant near me in PHX..yay~! I attended the soft opening and got to sample all of the filipino/mexican fusion tasties! The family is so friendly that you leave Kareys feeling all warm inside.., whether from the food or the family, and your wallet not too hit!  Cassava cake is the bomb..even though Im not to into sweets..  A bit hard to see from the street ..next to Blockbuster on 40th.. look for it..its worth it:-)

Im always trying new things when in Kareys.. this time roasted pork, curry to go, and of course, my craving for the fried rice....and wow! I think my migraine got better... because a 5 is the best thing for that:-)

While my boyfriend is in town for Nascar , he and his team stay down the street at a hotel near this bar and grill. Looking for nightlife options midweek this is what we found. Not bad! We sat at the bar. I ordered my famous snakebite... and yeah.. they had to ask, but they did it and it came out very well. Had to have two since they opened two ciders and two guinness to make the drink. Good music.. some nights there is karaoke. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The quesadilla on the appetizer menu is shareable and became a craveable favorite of my boyfriend and myself. Good bar!

On a scale of one to Chiang Mai... this is amazing Thai food. I am always craving warm, make it THAI hot, curry in the cooler months and have been on a personal mission to find JUST the right place here in the valley for THE perfect Thai cuisine. Not only the perfect Thai cuisine, but one that has all the right things : an authentic menu; good ambience that isn't 'diner-y' .. with a cold, brightly lit style of decor, great service; and a FULL bar. You would be surprised how finding THAT ONE great Thai place with all of these elements attached , hasn't been easy! Thai E-San is warm and inviting , with great service! Our waitress explained the heat factor on the dishes we ordered and made suggestions, as well. On this particular night, I was craving a Thai hot-pot style soup, initially, but ended up with the Pineapple Curry. My dish had lots of fresh veggies and chunks of fresh pineapple in a lovely green curry coconut milk; JUST what I wanted on a cold desert night! I got a two on the heat scale of one to five , and I was still in need of a tissue for my nose! ( Well! Best to know that, in case ! ) But, not to worry, as the great wait staff never let the water glass go dry. I got a side of the sticky rice for all that coconut curry goodness , so as not to waste the yummy saucy part. I coupled this with a Chardonnay and all was perfect .. I even had leftovers for the next day, as the servings--Serve! I highly recommend Thai E-San.. as I write this review, I'm suddenly craving that seafood hot pot again ... darn it and here it is closed as its late! Oh well! Maybe tomorrow, as they have a great take out menu. Just remember , if your a two to five sort , bring your tissues !

I admit Im not really a fan of the college bar scene in Tempe.. but enroute to the ASU/USC game last weekend.. my ASU friends said we should get our brew suds on before hitting the stadium.. little did I realize that I like beer (just one icy one!) while watching the Sundevils take on my home states school... USC! Or maybe thats to ward off the smack talkers of those from AZ around me! "University of Spoiled Children".. 'they are all spoiled beach yuppies!'... WHAT????) but my own Sundevil friends say there isnt a beer to be had inside the stadium.. This place was actually alot of fun... packed to the walls with , none other than big old loud frat boys.. and cute sorority girls.. The servers still remained friendly and swift.. amongst the crowd.. Daves Electric Beer was icy and hit the spot.. game on!

Love the freshly made items.. Perfect for flight crew..like me... Or singledom.. :-).. Fresh veggies, fruit.. Dairy.. All that you need .. It's not a complete, over huge grocery store .. So don't go there looking For 2000 options of shampoo.. But you can get your fresh, quick & easy all right here.. (my god.. I sound like a radio ad)

HANDS down .. THE best bridal salon in the Valley.. per my opinion. I recently was added as a bridesmaid to my friends wedding .. One issue, She ordered the bridesmaids gowns for only 3 maids , I was the 4th of 5 invited later . The original gowns were ordered months ago..NOW I needed one and didnt have the 4 month window needed usually for the wait: However, I was given the option of wearing an off the rack sample dress that was very , very similar. Twirl rocks! I called with all my stress and they were calm and friendly..'let us help you over your mistake and stress' attitude.. Dress can be here in September in time for your friends fittings' .. and of course, for the wedding of my friend in DC . They even opened especially for me, as my work schedule was so nuts I was never able to be seen when the shop was open! They have beautiful things in this salon.. are working to increase much of the samples.. No tiaras or headbands as of yet.. its nice to know you can find a place that understands that time is important and not everyone plans a year ahead ... and cares:-)

This outlet is the one outlet I find worth the drive from PHX. Know that like every outlet store.. it is the usual hit or miss. Although I am a Crew Prep at heart and have been since back the Crew dizzay so I usually always find something. I can make a preppy guys shirt work with my boyfriend jeans and a big belt ... put it all together with a hat and bam.. Crew style. I find the staff to not ever leave. The same peeps that worked there last year... are still rowing it this year. Love that. Because that tells me as a consumer, that they like the company as much as I do. I always find a good deal. So with that. I say.. drive it.

I am a junkie for amazing coffee houses. I have been since my very first coffee in a small place on a cold rainy day in Seattle when I was a young flight attendant newly housed in a rainy cold city away from my home! Well. Even when it's a 110* out, I am still a hot java junkie! I am one of those probable weird birds that has to have a HOT coffee in the morning .. after all the positive reviews from my Yelp family, I hopped into my hoopty and found my way to Giant Coffee. I am not real brave driving in craziness and I found it a little tricky to get to. Tip... park at CVS and call it good! Although, I did finally find my way into the back parking lot with a cool mural painted over the entrance in back. Once inside, order some of the most amazing coffee! ! Brewed perfectly to order. Mine was a Honey Vanilla nonfat latte.. my little daughter, ( yes. she's almost college age and I am in denial that she has started drinking caffeine?!!!) had the nonfat dry Capp.. do they balk at asking for extra dry or 220*? Nope. Not a blink. (Ummmm, where did she learn this Java lingo?? ) The barista even did a pretty little cappuccino art on her Java... :) Nice one! ( Mom is watching you , young barista san! ) She had a muffin too... I can't partake , but she loved it! There are cool drinks if your not an odd one like me. Cold Brew Java and teas too. Giant Coffee is very clean; there are fresh flowers around ... a great, VERY clean and LARGE bathroom ,( ask for the key and don't stand there at the door that clearly says 'ask for key at Giant or Bunky' , like I did for a good 5-8 minutes! #blondemomentsofkimberly) There is cool music playing. A few brekky or snack items including a breakfast burrito and oven baked eggs to order! Some day! When the sad end of the coffee cup is showing sans espresso... stop by the cute boutique that's inside Giant Coffee : Bunky Boutique. Cute, cute things and even unique AZ things :)

I am the girl who is all things Apple. Since one of my smart asianic friends told me I had to get an iPhone to be considered one of the intellects.. I jumped on board. OKAY.. I being all things Apple now... frequent Apple stores.. When I need an iPhone protector, I dont go to the annoying mall hagglers, nope.. I go to the store that knows my phone.. my pc.. my apples. THIS Apple store, leaves much to be desired. All Apple stores greet you when you enter.. not here. Thats okay.. tis the season of some grinches.. I head to the phone area.. the protector I bought 3 months ago is falling apart. I just decided to vent a bit when I am finally greeted about the fact that the $40 cover was all a mess now.. I dont drop.. I dont peel .. I treat my Iphone like the queen it is of apples.. well.. he reluctantly decides to just replace. But he keeps reminding me that its not the policy past 14 days. IF I get a $40 cover.. it better last more than 14 days. He didnt want cash.. he said hed 'have to go to the front' should I pay cash.. Im loving all the other Apple stores.. just not this one.. its a green sour apple...

We had dinner here last night after scrolling yelp for all the choices of where to get a glass of wine and a light bite. Yelp never fails! Neither did 5th & Wine. We made a reservation off the yelp app and took Uber  up the way to 5th. There was a wonderful band playing and we opted for a patio table outside. We started with a Pinot Noir and a Blanc sparkling wine off of Yanni's picks , as we had a yelp check in offer for such . , Our wonderful, well, versed waitress, Amber, even spoke with her manager to see if we both could use the yelp offer, (as it's usually only one p/check in), and it was honored. I would say don't expect that always, but a sweet gesture. Amber knew the menu well and helped with our wine selections; she did not rush us thru any part of our night and seriously, I've not had a waitress so nice in a very long time; it's refreshing.  One must do the bruschetta! We opted to sample all 6! Our favorite being the prosciutto with fig jam and mascarpone cheese... Yum! But all of them won't disappoint! My boyfriend and I split the Risotta of the day with Roasted Red Pepper Cream Sauce and topped with several large grilled prawns and topped with Parmesan cheese. Even with us splitting, we could not complete it all. This place is just lovely! If we lived in Scottsdale, it would be a regular 'go to' place because of the ambience and friendliness of the staff!

First time was a charm! Had a great experience with Hannah! I had no appointment. I live near this area of Scottsdale and I don't like the usual strip mall nail salon cattle call experience. I even had a yelp check in offer. That being said. NEXT time: FAIL. I had no appointment. BUT there was no one hardly in the place! WTH ... I waited 15 minutes and offered to come back and apologized for not having an appointment. I asked for the pricing at least 3x. First time. Gel mani: 30 plus pedi with callous remover (gross I am sure to yelp but.... ).. 27.. THIS time: Gel mani: 38 plus pedi with callous remover (gross again.. seriously trying to not TMI!).. 28.. ummm .. is this make up pricing each time? AND no menu price list this time. I checked my facebook offer. Nope. It was all for this catch a cancer tanning bed. No thanks. I checked my Iyelp. Could not load. Well awesome.  I even inquired about a set of acrylics with gel set. Language breakdown, I guess? Maybe I am using some unknown lingo. After a tip it was clearly the pricing I used to get when I lived in Georgetown spas for a hour long bomb ass deal ! NOT in Scottsdale where I am leaving there very confused. F A I L.   Two only because it's not Hannahs fault and I love Essie color and the gel lasts forever.

Need to get your love on... I guess this is your place! Pretty much everything you need is under this roof. The staff is friendly .. THEY will card you .. be warned.. AND I have been of age for a bit now! They are honest and friendly and don't make you feel like a freak for asking what needs to be asked.. or maybe what you can't ask! Get me??! Ending up here, I'll admit was a bit of a joke on a girls out wine night between me and my bestie.. and I'll admit we both left there a bit more 'educated'...

When I finally allow myself a sweet.. I want it all.. They will deliver.. Via a courier.. Extra fees apply.

My university rocks.. no other words. Its expanding the dorm area.. and more halls. Yes, you are in a Godly university, but it cant hurt.. small classes (meaning 20-40) .. means actually knowing your professor and even some of your classmates...

I don't even want to rate this place a 1. Pure and simple.. While renting under my perfect credit with the quite possibly the craziest girl  in the world.. I went to the manager begging, pleading for an apartment away from crazyville and the crazy, mean, drink like a fish from 7a-7p, roomie.. Because the asst. Manager was friends with her.. I was told my credit qualified me for the current apt.& hers didn't.. Ok.. Wth is that about? Don't care.. Be nice Kimberly.. The manager is less than kind to me, shes unprofessional, yet I decide I hate moving and I will stay; Knowing that those two hung out off property, I knew if I ever had an issue, Id be on my own. I went to corporate before agreeing. ALL I asked was please dont move her next door. Voila not only did she move right next door, but they gave her a car space next to mine in a huge underground garage, AND refused to change my locks.  Coming with police report for a stolen diamond platinum ring valued at over $3500, a dead rat placed inside my door, my lingerie shredded.. Keyed German auto.. Bad food tossed in my apt after they moved crazytown next door, Her with an extra key, Im sure of. I was scared to stay alone and often didnt. . I begged , cried and got nowhere ...I was told with a smirk that I could break my lease. Wow..how convenient when shes now off the lease.  Most , awful experience ever... Just don't.. Furthermore .. Area is quite dicey.. If you run like me, this area is a no go. More than that.. shady management will be the death of this place.

Love BMW Chandler!! I drive a bit further from my home to get my Bimmah her needs... My personal service guy is Todd Knapp... The day before a big trip, my back window decided to get loopy & not go back up.. I freaked !! I called Todd ..& he & his service crew had me in a loaner.. A nice 5series, while my warranty work was complete... He even told me not to panic.. Bmw's may be pricey, but I'll never drive anything else... Maybe once you go Bmmah u never go back:-) So, I drive the extra miles, because the sister of this dealer in Scottsdale, just down from my home.. Isn't as nice ... Oh yeah.. Love the valet service & coffee bar.. ;-)

I learned of Danny when my roomie treated my new ride to a much needed spa day at Dannys. It takes a bit of time.. It's not a drive thru wash that you find at the local gas station... It's a hand job .. Yep that is right .. A nice wash.. A nice buff.. Vac.. & for a bit more upholstery stains out..& scratches from dummies who don't care about those of us who have nice cars.. Gone. Danny is a complete 10 to me and my Beemer.. But I can only 5star him!

I love Einstein Bros. They are located right outside of TSA checkpoint A gates at Sky Harbor..once you get in thru security.. good luck finding anything half way healthy.. SO its this or its Paradise Bakery.. which I get bored with..Einstein has tasty bagels and schmear..but also a lighter version of sammys. I like the turkey lightened sammy. I get it often and I love it. The bagel is more like half the size. AND I think it's delish! The people here are friendly. Its airport pricing.. the only thing I dislike.

I truly, TRULY, try so hard to find a nail salon that just meets my basic needs that is near my home and I have yet to find that anywhere other than Chandler. I suppose I will continue to drive the 30 minutes for great nails that last! I took my daughter here on New Years Eve day, mainly because we had dinner reservations in Chandler and knew that we didn't want to make the trek over there and then back home to go back over to Chandler yet again. I was hopeful this would be a great place! There were five nail techs when we signed in and they were all busy. We were the first two in line to wait for gel manicures; I was surprised to beat the rush on this day. My daughter was taken for her gel mani about 10 minutes after we arrived, her mani looked great! The thing is that I like going to nail salons that have OPI or Essie gels so that when I ask for a certain color that I know, want or that I am used to, they know it. This place, just gave me a plastic thing of many, many different colors. The color that I wanted was a nude, buff, almost white color; in OPI it's called, 'My Vampire Is So Buff'. When I asked for that, they looked at me like, 'We don't have any vampires here crazy one.' This color that I chose did look close to the OPI 'vamp' one, but no. It was pink, as in baby pink. I did not have the patience to get picky and re-choose a color because obviously the colors on the plastic swatch are not what is coming out of the bottle. Its just nails and as long as the mani is fine, I will survive. My daughter had her cuticles clipped to the point of bleeding 4 times. I can be a true mother bear, as my daughter is pretty quiet about these things, I watched her flinch, and wanted to just call it and walk out, but we stayed. Her nail tech didn't apologize once and I noted that in my tip to her. My nail tech was actually very sweet and I truly would love to go back. I don't believe its her fault that the polish is crappy; as it chipped and pulled away from the edges with in two days of the manicure. Gel should and usually does last longer if the polish is not old and of better quality. Once again, a nail place near my home that isn't good. Boo.

More than happy , happy , joyed, JOYED to find this Under Armour store here when I was only here looking at the J Crew store. Just the night before I had dropped a cool $85 on a lightweight UA jacket at RR Sports for rain or fog summer running. Found it here for more than half that. I even like the color better. The staff was friendly and shapely. I like staff that work in sports stores who sell me athletic gear to play the part. Who knows a running shoe or gear better than someone who looks like they use it, right? I ended up spending about $90 on a running top, dri weave socks , running jacket and sports bra.. all UA and all under $100??? GET this one.. I even scored a $10 gift card! Booya! Play hard...shop hard.. score me.

I am impressed beyond all words to have such an amazing TRUE, CLEAN and FRIENDLY taco place near our home in the South PHX. I won't lie, since moving in with my boyfriend from my lovely Biltmore last year, I've been in a slump over the dining choices in his hood. This place is a treat! The little tucked away gem is family owned and the owner helps you decide on the menu if you have questions. At least he helped the night we were there. We ended up with way more than we could eat, but not to fear.. These tacos and burritos, which are HUGE, btw!.. heat up the next day, nicely. They will not scimp on ingredients in any of the choices that you make. I had tacos and I ate one and was stuffed. My boyfriend had a Wipeout Burrito. HUGE HUGE HUGE! He ate a quarter of it and was full! We also had rice and beans. The food is fresh and you can tell. The salsas are fresh and amazingly a feast for your tastebuds.  Because it is family owned and run, they are closed on Sunday. That is okay. Family is important. I love that there is obviously delight that goes into this business and the food they create. As long as we are here in this part of PHX, we will be back! Worth the trip if you don't live over here! It's very nice to have Gordas here!

My new hubby and I just love stopping into Gordas Baja Taco on the occasion we want some legit quick, yet NOT yucky, Mexican food. Gordas reminds me of the tacos you get in Cabo. They are fresh, the fish and shrimp are done just right and don't taste, ( Yes. I'm gonna say it.), fishy. The menu is a little far up on the wall and hard to decipher , BUT they have the paper take out menus there to help you thru deciding. The last time we stopped in to satisfy our need and craving for Cabo type tacos .. I wanted hard shell tacos instead of the menus soft style taco. The girl working the register told me that was a taquito style item I wanted and it was basically a no can-do. My husband gave me that look like , 'Really? You can't just get something off the menu? SOOO high maintenance! ' ( Ha! Well, we are married now.. I CAN be high maintenance and he's stuck with me! ) I was okay with that and was gonna order the chicken and fish tacos and be happy. Low and behold out comes , Raul, the owner and I had the hard shell on my tacos! How awesome is that?! Now I don't recommend everyone going into Gordas and getting all crazy with demands of items on the menu that aren't available , but this was great customer service! I love everything here! The salsa bar is fresh , the service is outstanding and the food is fresh and good. I've not had one thing that's not amazing here. I'm happy there is a fast, clean, grab and go , FRESH taco-burrito, enchilada place in S PHX. Worth the drive from other parts of the valley!

My update is a sad update to a review I just posted not that long ago and has always been a five! But literally, my husband who frequent Gordas when we crave fresh fish tacos were SO let down and then the follow up call when we got home and realized that an item we added to our order was missing , I had to update. After a quick hike, we were craving Gordas usual greatness... we made the trek over and noticed the 'Gordas Baja' was dark and only 'Taco' was lit up outside .. not a big deal , but from the street , if you didn't know and were 'new' to Gordas .. well. ?? It was dark out. Enough said. We enter. Neither my husband or I have ever loved the tall menu on the wall .. it's slanted and a bit hard to read. This night, Nothing, Nada, Zilch is on the menu. The girl working asks us if it's our first time and we respond with a ,'No'. I ask her what is going on with the menu ? She said its being replaced. Okay no biggie again, but AGAIN, if someone is new to Gordas.. mention it at first , maybe ?? Don't just stare at them and assume! We grab the paper take out menus and scroll. There's a handwritten, hard to read in cursive 'reminder' under these take out menus that say 'Eating undercooked, raw fish, poultry etc.......' ( You know the one!) Yeah. It's usually printed on a menu! Why is that handwritten in cursive here ? I don't remember that.  We order the Gerbanator , a small, a little pricier than other Gordas dishes, but good and fresh shrimp taco that's made with peppers and just enough cheese and onion and the cheese enchiladas. We love Gordas fresh salsa bar located in the back and head there to load our bag to take home. My husband and I noticed the hot water heater is leaking ALOT!! It's exposed so it's able to be seen. It's one thing after another tonight that is broken and it's disappointing. Then I remember I wanted a diet soda , not a usual thing for me , but when I have tacos IF I can't have tequila , well.. this is my trade off. I go back to order a soda. I wait a few minutes and finally say to the girl who's in the back , 'Hi! Sorry, can I order a diet soda?' She then informs me that NOW the soda machine is out of order. But they have bottles of soda. Not the plastic ones , ( BPA and all un-green and unhealthy , I know ! ), or cans even , old school bottles of regular sodas. Oh my gosh. Just not our night for a favorite place! I order some chips; she says she will place them with our order; my mistake is telling her I didn't need a receipt when I asked, as I would need that later when I called BECAUSE, GO FIGURE, she didn't add them and when we got home with our order that she brought to us while we waited , FIRST time out, one thing was missing ; so she returned to the kitchen giggling to herself and mumbling something ; then no bag and she returned again mumbling and giggling , 'Oh my God , TO GO!' , she giggles. Now we get home and...!!! NO chips. I was so irritated that I hesitated, but I called. NOT that I was gonna drive back, but I wanted to let her know. How many times on Yelp does someone say , 'Did you let the manager know ?' After I've not let managers know in the past sometimes thinking I was making a mountain of a mole hill, I'm trying this year.. and I do it nicely:) It's just chips and possibly an honest mistake so when I called , I spoke with the girl who waited on us ; that I've seen her there several times ;this time the owner was not there. To add more frustration , she acted like she didn't know who I was or what the scenario was. I was there just 5 minutes ago, I explained!! Now that's when I got more agitated because NO one was in Gordas .. only two men who left shortly after we ordered. She had to have known because I explained my order , gave the story of the machine being broke , my original receipt number. So she denied it. I hung up. Let it go. It's two bucks and some change.  Our food was not as good as before either. Everything seemed 'runny'. My shrimp taco tasted anything but fresh and I was a tad afraid to eat it. I tossed it. The shrimp were smaller than I remember. Fail is when you deny when a customer let you know of a problem and also when may very well lose frequent customers with giggling rudeness and lack of concern. Get your act together now. Put some effort back into this place that has major potential! It's  sad what I witnessed the other night on many levels. :-(

This legendary place is a beauty that is tucked up in Paradise Valley with an awe-striking view of Camelback Mountain. With history thru the 1930's the beauty of the mansion is magnificent. The patio is huge and I was excited that our group was able to sit outside without it being so hot and take in the beauty of the place and the mountain. We started off in the bar with happy hour. Loved the cheese plate. Loved the sausage plate too. It's ample and enough to share with one-to-three people as a sampling. The bar is busy. It was pretty much standing room only. I waited for the waitress to bring my house marg. when she forgot and reminded her a couple of times. Yet working in the service industry at 39k feet, I am forgiving and I get that! Meh. Wasn't a fan. Pass on the house marg that is priced way above what it should be. My boyfriend got the Pom Fire marg. a mix of margarita/pomegranite/jalepeno. He loved it; but was happy with just one before heading to his usual brew. I could not taste it, despite the desire to, as I am allergic to jalepenos. Bummer. I opted for the seasonal Strawberry Bliss drink and loved that one. It's a mixology of greatness containing champagne, mint sprigs, muddled strawberries and liquor. MMMMMMMM. Blissful.  Again know that these drinks aren't for the budget conscious. A happy hour drink that ranges from $9-13 is not exactly 'happy'.  Dinner we moved on to the patio. Live music provides an ambience as does the back drop of the mountain and lighting is just correct. Our picks for the night: Truffle fries.. Yum.;Filet 8 oz with Peppercorn. Heaven in my mouth.; Tenderloin Pork. Yum; Sticky Buns. Don't like sweets, but everyone raved over that gooeyness!; A bottle of Pinot Noir. Get ready . Dinner alone will set your wallet back over $250 smacks. Great service. Perfect setting for the desert. Awesome food. Steep price. That being said. You decide.

I thought this Vig would never win over MY Vig near my home in Biltmore. Hmmmm... well so far it did. I met my boyfriend here because it's near his office. I loved the patio. More so than Arcadia. Not that it's a competition. I like the bar out back too. Not that I had drinks in the mid of the afternoon! I had a international trip to fly later that day. It's super trendy...as is the other Vig. Cool atmosphere and very busy. Complimentary valet. I like that , if they are gonna force a valet on you, for sure. I had the seasonal salad: shrimp, cojita cheese, greens, pear, I had them hold the carmelized nuts, and balsamic on the side. I loved it! My boyfriend had the salmon...It came on a corn cake, with mango salsa. All plates clean. Winner , Winner this Vig's a Winner.

Called the night before when I realized that my boyfriends and my flights were gonna be like a day apart and I had no ride to his house. This rate beat everyone elses. I called when I landed to make sure they were there. They gave prompt service and pick up with in ten minutes of me getting curbside. I went all the way to Concord and the rate was $40. He was surprised when I tipped him. I will admit his GPS was a bit off and he didn't set it to the morning commute to allow traffic changes and lane closures. But he was apologetic. I was so happy to get home within half and hour..shower and be in my bed without a flaw. Highly recommend!

Having lived in DC and having been to one of the originals, I've gotta say it kind of saddens me to see 5Guys go global. But I can't say I don't love being able to get 5Guys in PHX now. Because I used to have them ONLY when I was home in DC and then after my divorce and move west.. ONLY on a layover there. BEST burger I have had EVER and being from Cali where IN and OUT rules.. That means something. Always clean. Always friendly.. ALWAYS fresh huge burgers and fries to share..

I'm giving Stand Up Scottsdale a solid 5 star. Here's why. First of all I love to laugh. If someone can make me laugh; truly make me laugh... I will remember them. There is enough anger and bitterness in this world , so humor and wit are blessings. That said , Stand Up, made me laugh my yayas off. The comedians were all very good. I had not ever been to Stand Up in my 8 plus years of desert-dom and finally got my chance on Saturday when invited out to celebrate our best friend's  birthday party gathering beginning at Stand Up. We got our tickets online and all was easy - peasy when we got to the door at 1850p for our check in. We were promptly seated and served our first round of drinks. Impressive top shelf liquor selection to choose from. Since we were late to our hotel after work , we needed food! The BBQ is good. Initially we were brought the wrong order but the waitress was sweet, apologetic and made it correct; that means everything. She had her hands full, as this was a large group of people! Many from a fitness club in Scottsdale; let's face it... That's NOT an easy, nor low maintenance group! The headliner was Joe Derosa. Hilarious. Again all of the acts were good/great. Howard is funny, he's quirky cute and was making sure everyone was taken care of. Busy like a bee the whole time. He mentioned our group and thanked us more than once for coming out. Being grateful, and courteous, again, goes along way. I have to say, this was not the guy I saw on Jon Taffer's Bar Rescue once! He really seemed a genuine person. Know this, there is a little dig in the show about yelpers , & he says he will answer back! So, with that, YELP responsibly. Well, Stand Up Scottsdale, you won this Elite's 5 star. I loved you and your staff; nope, your not, 'a  F'ing restaurant,' as you say and we did get our food and get this... It was good! And so were all of you! Thanks for a great night of laughs for me, the birthday boy and our entire group! Return rate 100%

I have been going to Bliss ReBar before it was Bliss. It was Fate then! I was elated when a friend and co-worker invited me to his soft opening. I have been going and in love with Bliss since. I've always loved the outside bar. Last week my friends had their dinner club party there. Awesomeness that I was invited. As I was just there to celebrate my company's agreement passing hosted by Bliss! I took my then new-ish boyfriend to 'haze' him, if you will to my flight attendant world. He fit right in and loved Bliss too. I particularly love Bliss nachos. Scott loves Bliss Mac&Cheese Balls. We may have ordered two orders that party night. Too many strong Ketel drinks make it all hazy!  Last week at dinner club I had the street tacos. Amazing. A few of us shared the hummus plate and again, the nachos with chicken. Several drinks. I actually had the waiter bring me seltzer to soften the strong of my vodka drink! Where does that ever happen! My boyfriend had the mac&cheese entree this time. Holy heaven. I even tasted it. Yum. The only thing we disliked. The panna cotta. On the menu it stated it was with marcerated berries. It came with kiwi fruit and it was too hard to be called 'panna cotta'. Which is an italian cream that is cooked just until it becomes a bit thick and congealed just a little less than the consistency of a custard. This was beyond jello as we have in the US. So the waiter took it away and off our bill with no question. He was gracious and nothing but sweet.  I would not ever rate Bliss less than a 5 because so many things about Bliss are above par. All of our friends desserts and meals were raved about. It's a super trendy, fun and hip place. Great people watching! Awesome Sunday brunch too!!!

My new FIND in the valley. While killing time , my friend and I wandered into Charming Charlie. Always in the want for new accessories, we were in heaven. But theres also cute tops and dresses. Affordably priced too!  All color coordinated with accessories in each area. The place is big and abundant. But not like Forever 21 so you are overwhelmed. The staff is sweet.. Like I said.. It's new find!

This was our second time at Beckett's Table. I still loved it as much as the first time. We all met for some pre-dinner drinks at the bar. It's crowded, so know that going in. Beckett's has very cool drinks and wines. I started with a house Pinot Noir and my boyfriend a simple IPA. Our friends ordered some of the various mixed drinks and I sampled a few; strong! Since I'm not much of a mixed drink girl, I'm happy with my Pinot and the wine selection here is awesome! We moved on to our table and ordered a few apps. We had the Mac cheese with pancetta: a melt in your mouth delight! We had the deep fried deviled eggs: different and I'm a fan! The biscuits and apple butter: if your gonna splurge, these biscuits are to die for! The grilled cheese with the small bowl of tomato soup for dipping: I thot the bread was too thick, but everyone else loved them. For dinner, the fork tender short ribs are huge and so, so tender. They are presented atop a mashed potato, baby brussel sprouts and carrots. I've had the Osso Bucco before and both of these meat dishes are a total treat. My friend who was visiting from Hawaii, had sangria and the butter salad. I tested it and it was light and very good. The sangria was also great, light and refreshing! To finish our meal, my boyfriend and I had the Coconut Cake. Yum. Decadence in one bite kind of yum. It is a moist cake with coconut sided with coconut pudding and dark chocolate swirled around. Need I say more? Our friends had the Smores: smores with peanut butter and chocolate dipped bacon. I think its a bit weird and not a fan, but they loved it. It's nice to "Come Together" as the pins say on the tables, and have a neuvo American food place be trendy with comfort food classics.

I've been to both True Food Kitchens .. I love both of them. Although I think this one may be my favorite. You are greeted warmly. They have a rockin patio and this time of year it's perfect to hang out on with a glass of one of their organic wines. I like the fact that everything is fresh and it's organic. The staff is good at explaining portion sizes and the menu if you just don't get the concept. This particular day, I had spaghetti squash casserole . Loved it. We had a plate of hummus and pita and each of us had a wine. I don't find it anymore pricier than any other lunch place in Kierland Commons. If you do, well McDonalds is always around the corner somewhere, right?? I love a option like this, when you have a celiac or gluten allergic individual in your group:-)

May go down as a best way to start the night out for a best date night ever. iPic is the Waldorf Astoria of the movie theatres. My boyfriend set the seats up earlier that day and me , not really being much of a 'movies on date night kind of girl' , was kind of like, 'eh.. okay'. I was, however, blown away. We had intended on having dinner first at Tanzy, but we ate a little much bruschetta at our uptown meet up earlier. We headed over to Salt, within the theater, and ordered a nice bottle of Pinot Noir and made our way to our seats. We had second row, VERY cozy, comfy seats. You can order what you like from your seats.. appetizers, champagne, very 'up' mixed cocktails, wines.. desserts.. pretty much what your spoiled heart desires.  It's 21+ only.. No worries of children or babies interrupting your night at the movies with noise. Very clean bathrooms with nice amenities. AND if you don't want the wine bottle at your recliner or seat, you can always vend it from the cool wine carousel in the 'vending' area. There are even buckets of beer or soft drinks should you not desire the beverage of alcohol infused.  There is the option of free popcorn, but I am personally not much of a fan of popcorn. I just wanted my wine..my glass and my cute boyfriend on this Saturday night.   TIPS-- --Order online.. do it maybe a day early for best seat selection and for the best, most popular movies.  --Become a member.. It's free. It'll score you some good discounts on both the movies and other things.. like vittles and sippage.  --Go early. Enjoy this experience of this pretty much one-of-a-kind theater experience.. iPic is only about a handful many in the US. Get some food at Tanzy and some libations at Salt.  --Valet is free with Premium seating.  --Pillows and blankets also come with upgraded seating.   What's not to love about starting your night out here.. well, you can actually finish your night out here too. It's literally a one stop..everything in one place.. place.

I was introduced to First Flight by my friend who is based in CLT with Nascar. He had to take me there because he raved over the sushi and the sake. When I was flying out of there not in my uniform I gave it a shot. It's strategically placed in CLT where the main food court is after security. Make no mistake, it looks like a bar. BUT you can get sushi and sashimi to go on the fly at the walk up area and pay at the bar. I just wasn't that impressed. I tried to keep in mind that it is sushi.. in a airport.. and IN Charlotte. Because I grew up near the sea where the sushi is still squealing , or whatever sushi would do if they could yell, I am, without a doubt pretty picky about my sushi. Sake is sake. It's strong..hot.. and can jack you up before flying if your not cautious. Well, I felt that way about the sushi. I don't care how sweet Carolina the staff is, and they all are! I truly hoped I made it through this 5 hour flight home with no sushi remorse.

When one decides to venture into the land of the Fox, it's usually because that land is full of win. FRC has an amazing group of restaurants in the valley and The Arrogant Butcher does not let you down either. The Arrogant Butcher is in the centrally located downtown area across from the Usairways Arena but also near other venues downtown, as well. May as well make a night of it if your downtown.  On a whim we came here on a Monday night wanting to test this one FRC out that we had not added to our list. We were not disappointed.  We arrived at TAB about forty minutes before happy hour ended and were quickly waited on and schooled on the cheeses of the day and the drink of the day. Our waitress was on her game!  We started with The Fix: a mixology cocktail of smooth white rum; fresh lemon; and a fresh blackberry compote sat atop this refreshing, light drink . It was 'The Fix' for our happy, alright! For $4 on happy hour! No one can complain about that!  Our appetizer was the Antipasto plate. For $8 on the happy hour menu you get a generous serving of fresh french bread, olives, a dijon mustard, a cheese of the day , (ours was the 'Montchevre; ) and charcuterie meat (ours was a dry 'Framuni' salami). We added another cheese off the cheese board menu, because we consider ourselves serious fromage people! We were torn between more of the Montchevre cheese , which is a aged, smooth goat cheese, with the look and consistency of brie or the Crescenza cheese, which neither of us had ever heard of. Our awesome waitress explained and even suggested we go with the Crescenza since it was a 'new' cheese for our palate. It came out with a cherry compote and more fresh french bread and was an ample supply. Crescenza is a creamy, almost like cream cheese with a stronger flavor and goes perfectly on the bread with a little of the compote schmeared on top. I was full after The Fix and these appetizers, BUT, we had already ordered dinner!  My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. It was served with Boursin spinach that was sauteed perfectly and a few crispy fingerling potatoes on the side. His filet was a good 1 1/2 inches thick and cooked to perfection. It did seem it was over salted possibly after the cooking process and that could have been lightened up a bit. Simply, it didn't need it! It was perfect without all that salt!  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Chicken. I was stuck between about three different options, despite knowing that I wasn't that hungry! I went with this option because it sounded different. It is a chicken breast that is butterflied and egg dipped into panko crumbs and stuffed with a ton of crab meat! Then served over a bed of sauteed spinach and topped with just enough of lemon and caper au jus. Again, the salt content was a bit overwhelming, but the chicken was cooked to perfection and so tasty that I don't want to knock it for that. Literally, such ample servings on both entrees we not only could have shared, we should have shared!  As if I wasn't full enough! My boyfriend 'reminded' me how much I love peanut butter. Okay. Twist my arm! We split the warm Peanut Butter Cup that is a peanut butter mousse served warm with a scoop of dark chocolate gelato. It melts into your mouth and is more for three people sharing and not just for two!!  My rating: 5 on happy hour 5 on waitress 5 on decor and atmosphere 3 on dinner (only because of salt factor) 5 on dessert Make this a solid 4! or even a 4.5!   I will be sure to trot back to Fox! I always do!

This small little breakfast place in Tempe is amazing! Mark, himself is the chef! No joke. This is a small, little find of a place that one may be lucky enough to find if you don't blink.. OR if you have yelp, of course! The staff right off from entering is nice and ready to make you happy. We were instantly greeted with waters and told that the pastries were down to two because they are supposedly THAT good! We did not embide, BUT, maybe someday! I loved that they advised us of that, though. I also loved that we instantly got water without having to ask and the coffee we did ask for was on it's way shortly thereafter.  From the menu, I would sum Mark's Cafe as being a Benedict place! There are almost a dozen types of Benedict's on the menu and a couple on the 'specials board'. I ordered the Neptune Eggs Benedict. I was pleasantly surprised, (as I always am in the desert), to get REAL crabmeat on this Benedict. Mark's ran out of crab for half of the Benedict, BUT the waitress was super sweet and offered any other Benedict on the menu for me with an apology. To be honest, I was full off the one half of the Neptunes already! Neptunes is obviously a crab benedict underneath the usual hollandaise, but they have a plain hollandaise and a spicy hollandaise. I highly recommend the spicier of the two. It's freshly made by Mark and that makes all the difference in the Benedict. The second half I got to replace what was missing from half of the Neptune was a special on that day: the French Benedict. Same type of typical Benedict but with proscuitto. Yum! It comes with a side of house potatoes too; yummy for that leftover hollandaise sauce!  My boyfriend ordered the Biscuits and Gravy. It was a HUGE plate of just that: Biscuits with sausage gravy, both freshly made. It came with a couple of eggs and bacon too. In case, all that sausage in the gravy just wasn't gonna be enough! There was a Blueberry Pancake ordered and on the table by our friend. She asked for just one from the stack order. They happily accommodated her request. That pancake was the size of the dinner, err, breakfast plate it was on. SO huge! The blueberries come on the side for you to spoon out at your delight and are syrupy and a concoction made again, by Mark the Chef , himself.  The coffee never ran empty and the staff was super nice and happy.  Mark's is a small cafe. We arrived about 1130am on a Sunday and it was almost full and I would imagine it fills up with quite a wait during the busiest times on a weekend.  I love a family run business that is local such as Mark's Cafe. I learned after our brunch there that day that Mark's does catering too. Good to know for any events in the upcoming holiday season! If he can perfect a Benedict and it's sauce, I can only imagine what he can do with holiday pies!

SOME of the best mexican food I have had in the valley. I never make it out to this part of the valley because I live more in the Scottsdale area. BUT while staying out here for Nascar weekend I came here with my boyfriends team and I was blown away. I know me some Mexican food! It's so good I can see myself making the trek out there to get my fix every now and then before the next race in November! The staff is super friendly! Salsa, and I think I am an expert.. I like it somewhat hot, but not 'can't swallow hot' .. was mind blowing. I had the shrimp and carne asada fajitas. Couldn't finish them. Generous portions; you won't go away hungry. We shared a pitcher of margaritas and I left happy.. happy..happy:-)

A craving for Thai food brought me here. Upon parking in the crazy downtown area, I realized there were three Thai restaurants all within a block. I do love having choices! We started with the Crab Ragoons and the Kings Royal Suit and Tsing Tsao's to wash it down with while we took our time perusing the ample menu options. I opted for a Coconut Hot Pot with Shrimp (aka Tom Kah). It was creamy with just enough of curry spice to off set the coconut milk base and loaded with shrimp and veggies. I always get a rice side to add to my hot pot soups and they did that happily gratis. We also got the Hawaiian Fried Rice minus the raisins. Again, this dish, as well, as the hot pot was enough for two and leftovers the next day. There is a plethora of authentic Thai options and the wait staff is friendly and eager to please. I would have loved to have seen my fave Penang dish with pineapple and it's seemingly hard to find a Thai restaurant with a full on bar. Parking is always crazy downtown, but it is downtown. Def be back for my Thai fix.

Girls day out with one of my besties in her neighborhood we opted for K Luxury for our nails. I got a gel french manicure and she got a full set and wanted the pearlized tips. There was a language barrier and finally after several explanations that my friend did not want white tips  we finally got the pearlized ones out of her drawer! The guy who did my mani was good. He was happy and joking and quick.. Most importantly, he listened and did not speak too much of the native language to his colleagues. I hate that! It's also rude. How many nail salons do you go to and they speak their language with each other and always chuckle ... then you are left wondering if they are talking about the blonde ones ugly nails! The girl who did my friends mani and gel set was not so nice. Neither of us like the long nail/arcrylic 'look' .. we are flight attendants and it looks yucky when a flight attendant is serving with these giant long colored claws. I only have arcrylics on to hinder the amount of time I have to spend on my  nails due to flying. I get them short and my friend could NOT get this across to Miss Zero Personality no matter how many times she had to say, 'shorter please'. Nonetheless, decent prices. Good overall service. No cuts to the cuticles, (OUCH!) and we were in and out of there in about 50 minutes. They have a huge color selection of gels to choose from.

The last time I was here , I felt things had gone way south from my earlier review. My nails were not good and I had to return to have them fixed and waited for 30 for that! My feet were still rough after my pedi and I could not get my point across to save my life. Now on the search for a great nail place near my boyfriends home. Just can't seem to find one in Phoenix..

Last night after landing back in Phoenix after a week of traveling under my belt/wings again, my boyfriend took me for dinner at North Italia in Arcadia. I have had this FRC place on my 'must try soon' list for some time. I had to dodge in after our car was valeted, (complimentary, btw), and get out of my poly/wool/mostly poly tho uniform that would def show who I work for and what I do when I work; yeah. That's always good for some looks. Girl with wings on on a Saturday dodging right into a restaurants restroom for a quick change and hair down so she can have the much needed drink after flying all week! So 3 minutes later I am a new looking girl and we were promptly seated. Our table was 'European style' seating: small table for two next to other twos near the open Italian kitchen. Our waiter was on it and right there to take our orders, but my boyfriend let him know we needed a few minutes to collect ourselves and do a quick catch up. He was sweet and said that since we had our drinks, a pitcher of the red sangria my boyfriend had stocked us with while waiting at the bar for my quick-change and our table, he would check with us in a few minutes and that there was no rush. That is nice because how often are you seated and felt rushed to order?! Our red sangria was just sweet enough and yet not too sweet made with blood orange and brandy to cut too much 'sweet' out. We decided on ordering a few small plates for nibbling with our sangria. We ordered the combo of charcuterie of meats and cheeses and seasonal roasted veggies. It also came with a great sweet/tart chutney that paired nicely with the fresh mozzerella and spicy salami. The bread, which is house made, and one of things you can see in the open kitchen concept, was toasted and amazing. That could have been my entire dinner, happily! We also shared the roasted artichoke that comes with a alioli for dipping. Just enough garlic and tad of parmesan cheese and roasted nicely. Our favorite small plate tho was the Fonduta. Rich melted, warm Italian cheese served in a black iron pan and topped with a sweet tomato jam for dipping more toasted bread in. We were full after sharing these small plates. The menu is very vast: PIzzas,homemade pastas, meats and seafoods to pair with a nice wine/local beer list and several housemade cocktails with a Italian spin on most. We stayed and moved over to the bar because we liked the ambience and vibe of North so much. We had another wine and our friends joined us. We ALMOST had dessert because that menu also looked so tempting. This place is another FRC great. The patio looked amazing with a huge fireplace that had a roaring fire; outdoor seating to the bar; clean restrooms and cool decor. That coupled with a great menu and vibe and fresh made entrees all make for a great place! Oh. There is also, The Rocket. North's 'food truck' that does private events. We asked about it as it drove into the North parking lot. Apparently it has a brick oven on board! NOW, I am wondering what I can book and use The Rocket for! Cool idea! Thanks for the great night, North!

I really like O.H.S.O. Made sure that we got here in time for happy hour and to get a place on the patio. Walking in there are doggie treats for free, should you have a doggie! The smell of pretzels, I am assuming, wafts thru the place and gives you the want for a large pretzel and beer. Free valet and friendly hops to take your ride away.  The pitchers of any Arizona brews are $6 ... Good price on the smaller pitcher for two and a good way to get a sampling without too much of a commitment. COULD have been alot colder. Nothing worse than beer that isn't icy.. in my opinion, at least. We started with apps of the hh smaller bites. I loved the pretzel and cheese dip/fondue. Could have given me a warm pitcher of that! We also had the OHSO Green Chile Dip ..not a thing wrong with it and the yucca chips are a treat. I'm a fan with the exception of the beer not icy thing and letting my water go dry. Picky picky! But a huge offering of brews on a nice patio is a good, good thing!

You know what rhymes with weekend ? Breakfast!! Okay maybe not. But let me be blonde and have this one. For me.. breakfast and weekends at home go together like pancakes and syrup and champagne and Oj! I was so happy to see another location of Breakfast Club come to the valley! This location is downtown; has a great patio and you can walk up to the bar and get started with morning libations or the hair of the dog drinks while you wait for your table. I highly recommend the Bloody Mary! The menu has a variety of unique breakfast items like Omelets, Benes and several southwest dishes too, just to pay homage to our great area. All made with fresh ingredients! There are the usual waffle and pancake items too... on this particular weekend day, we sat outside under one of the large umbrellas and I had a Breakfast Grilled Cheese and a Cappuccino... just to top off that amazing Bloody Mary I had ! The BCC is a sourdough sandwich layered with hash browns; eggs; bacon; two( !!!! ) cheeses--- Fontina and cheddar and toasted perfectly! My husband and I had such a great time on this patio and the service was so friendly ..we had another drink .. this time a Mimosa and spent another hour up here.. I highly recommend this place for breakfast, brunch or any Fun Day!

This is such a pretty little brunch place! I saw it on yelp when staying the weekend at my boyfriends place and felt it was on the yelpery of my 'have not trieds' list. I did not find the place to be slow..but maybe because I was having a much needed date with my much busy boyfriend and my much busy self. IF it were slower than say , Denny's. Well... suck it up and slow down and enjoy your coffee, impatient consumers. The food is fresh and very good. The portions are huge.  I would improve on the presentation a little of the ice/water/ice tea/lemonade/coffee station. That felt very much like a potluck at a southern church to me. I would also offer more offerings of espresso drinks on the menu.Add some nicer cream and nicer creamers; agave sweetener and raw sugar.  I don't think people would have an issue spending for that. As the station mentioned above is all complimentary. Also when I asked for jam for the divine flaky biscuit, a treat I never allow myself, as I am gluten free for most of my life with the disclaimer of 'slip ups' on the monthly! .. I was given a Smuckers jam that I could find at any kiosk at any walk up bar in any hotel or McDonalds. Hmmmm... a place as pretty as this needs to square up with one of the farmers wives and get some fresh honey and jam on the table! Little touches would make this place a 5 in my book. But the meal was superb. Hands down one of the best places for a nice leisurely brunch on the weekend ONLY in the area.

We got the hook up to get in VIP here ... OR chances are we may not have ... The line was out the door beyond velvet, beyond velvet rope. The concept is unique. The club is amazing and as a view of the Bellagio Fountains. Beautiful girls with masks dancing and delivering obvious high end bottle service with pomp and circumstance to said table. They are like masked mimes that ride atop of other masked shoulders to deliver the goods! I like it. The typical Grey Goose DOES not seem to get all the hype. BUT Dom does! We loved just people watching . AND the DJ rocked! You better be dressed to impress and again have some sort of hook up on 'nights that matter'. Do not go here on a budget. To top shelf drinks can set you back over $36 so you may just consider a bottle service with another couple or with friends. Worth it just to have a place to sit:-)

My friend, Leslie and I ventured into Malabar in Charlotte one nice, balmy night for some sangria to get away from the Epicenter untz untz. IF you get me. ON first sight, the manager is suave. The heat pours off of him and it makes you want to drink the sangria mucho gusto.. :-) We had the paella, which takes a bit of time to prepare, but worth the wait. In the mean time, we opted for a sample of tapas: Croquettes; empanadas; and pimentos with manchego.. we opted for the pitcher of red sangria and its well worth it. Left there sangria swayed. AND had to come back the next night.. you know.. just to sip the sangria.. Una vez mas:-)

Great staff! FAB food! LOVE that you can ala carte the tacos and add or take away from what you need. Beans..yep. Beans .. Nope. Margaritas .. Icy.. top shelf .. Premium.. strong! Who's driving again??? Love the way that the flat shell is brought instead of greasy, carb laden chips all taken from some plastic bag and greased down and tossed before you with some jarred salsa. I love this place. It brings class to the cocina. I always get the Mezcal chicken tacos. Eat one. Bring the rest home for the next day. Splurge on the beans and flat shell and salsa. Tres bien!

My new addiction on healthy ... and not only is this place healthy... its good for you ... it's a treat for your body... your senses... and packaged in a way that travels well for someone on the go ... say if your a fly girl like me! I have been to all 3 stores in the valley. I like the one near me on Shea and Tatum. It doesn't have the 'kitchen' but everyone is friendly and helpful. In fact, the last time the guy walked out my Fit Foods purchase to my car. How's that for service! I have my favorite foods like Brian's Enchiladas, which at the small portion size is perfect for me. I love the Salmon and Pear Salsa ...again I get the small portion size but it comes in medium and large and all are calorie and serving breakdown conscious. I am on a gluten free diet lately for health reasons affiliated with migraines. These foods freeze well and the staff was even a little surprised when I shared that with them. I don't think the price is off at all.. it's fresh and it's healthy and if you went to buy and prepare this on your own you would be spening the same or more. Worth the trip... I hope MyFitFoods opens more stores.. My heart adores!

My Fit Foods is all about health! I came in for the first time in a couple of years to grab some meals for clean eating after my mean workout the other day. New meals and new 'color coding' , which is indicative of size. The meals at My Fit Foods are fresh made daily, clean , low fat, and low carb. They can customize meal plans for revamping ones diet. I love this location, but they do run out of meals, which makes sense considering that the meals are freshly made. Solve that problem by ordering online or calling ahead for a quick pick up! Everything from breakfasts like Flippin' Pancakes, ( gluten free pancakes with mixed berry compote and a side of chicken maple sausage / 320 cals); lunches like Spinach & Chicken Enchiladas topped with a yummy tomatillo salsa, cheese and beans/360cals for the small and 540 cals large ; dinners that include actual beef tenderloin that's TENDER or tacos!! Freshly made designer type salads loaded with proteins in them averaging 200-400calories. You can grab snacks...yogurts, water, juices ... mainly, I like fresh, clean, calorie and low carb meals that you can grab and go! I love when I am flying that I can take four days of meals in a bag with me on my trips and not blow my diet in one redeye! I'll save that for when I land in Roma.. Thanks My Fit Foods you are a savior for the clean / health conscious eater!

Awesome place to head before heading off to a Sun's game. In fact, since the Sun's no longer win much any more.. head back at the half if they continue to lose?! Okay..I kid!!! No ...Not Jason Kidd.  We wandered into Fuego and got the last seat on the pation about 2 hours before the game mid week. Awesome happy hour with alot of good drink and menu choices. Better yet the drinks we had were strong. Maybe a little too strong! I had the "Remix Sangria" ... A mix of red and white sangria. My boyfriend, a pomegranate mojito also on the hh menu. Good stuff. Strong stuff. Our apps that we made into dinner were the empanadas:  a mixture of beef within pastry ,  big and hearty! The Fuego nachos with carnitas, very good sized portion . Nothing too special or out of the ordinary. The Cubano sliders, our very favorite. Could have easily passed on the nachos and did another order of sliders. I found the empanadas a little interesting. I have traveled to Puerto Rico several times and didn't find them to be authentic. I found them good tho! In PR, they are much smaller and these almost reminded me of a peroshki dish I had in Russia once. No matter. It was good. Not that expensive for four drinks and 3 generous sized appetizers at a cool place with a super nice waiter.

NOW that I have been to all of the My Fit Foods stores.. I have to say I will review this one NOT on concept...Because the concept...I love... and it works! ... For someone like me... a traveler...a single, fit girl, who has a food allergy and who likes fresh...easy and now... (and by the way...THIS isn't comparing to ANY frozen diet food , hence the other review!.... EVER eat fresh and healthy....Lean Cuisine...frozen and sodium laced with a bunch of preservatives...??? Read your labels, girl!...) This is my go to happy place now! For usually less than $6, I can have a nice fresh, gluten healthy meal that is savvy and diet friendly. I yup that with a nice tossed salad of my making and voila, I have my own need and want to splurge come weekend date time! So with that in mind. This location is just a bit on the 'hover craft' side. But I still like them. Who knows if they are on a commission ... or the 'boss' was lurking in the back watching the staff. I did not like being asked every 10 seconds if I was okay. I said I was okay and I am STILL okay now.. haha... and get this.. I will be in about 1 minute! Can't blame the unfriendly and over helpful though..in these times that is a little hard to come by. My Fit Foods is a great concept. NOW if My Fit Foods could take over the fast food nation maybe America would not be the worlds most obese nation...oh well...it's a dream!

Always on it when I come in before my multi day trips. Call ahead to have allergy free foods made fresh and ready. I love that this My FF is open on Ray so I don't have to drive up to PV anymore! The staff is knowledgable and always helpful. Love the B12 mix. Always good for flying red eyes and not landing sluggish. Being healthy is a choice and MY FF makes it easy and convenient! Can't wait for a home delivery service maybe ? Someday?

I still love My Fit Foods. This place is a FRESH food concept different than any other around, & yes, that does mean another Fresh place with foods costing nearly the same. The difference here is, that the food is made fresh and take a look... The ingredients are not processed! It's not a sodium-laden frozen food meal you grab at a grocery store and it lasts into next year, this actually is clean-eating. For those of us who care about what we put into our bodies or with serious allergies, that's very important. Tonight I brought my boyfriend here to stock up on the next five days of meals. Why? Well, because we need a little revamping of our diets and why not get back to clean eating and doing what is good for the body? No. A frozen lean cuisine isn't as good for you as you think; read the label:) What I love, besides that it's made fresh , and local, is that you can order and pick it up when your ready and they will adhere to any allergy or dietary needs that you have. Kombucha !!

Hi. My name is Kimberly and I am a coffee junkie. I am 100% addicted and I don't want help for my problem. I am fine with it. I don't care to detox from this caffeine obsession. Just let me have it and all will be okay with all in my world. When I run out of Nespresso pods, those are very bad days and then we all may have a problem. Usually there is a lead up time about a week prior when I notice the depletion starting. Those are the days when I look in the Nespresso pod holder and say sleepily , 'Yeah, yeah.. I need to login to Nespresso and order a few sleeves... I'll do that when my coffee kicks in.' Then I forget. Thanks to Yelp, of course, I learned of this Nespresso Boutique! Problems of procrastination of caffeine addiction ordering solved! This is the only boutique in all of Arizona and one of few in the US. I have a career that takes me abroad often and I have been able to pop into Nespresso in Paris or Madrid and grab my sleeves of Nespresso when I am there, but that's not always convenient...!? Now is it?!! I walked into my small heaven when I saw this wall of all my lovely colorful Nespresso pods lined up neatly in lovely little rows along the wall inside Sur la Table at Keirland Commons. They even carry the limited flavors that run out pretty quickly online. Like the Chocolate Cafe that was over the holiday season. They have all the current Nespresso machines and accessories like the perfection frothing aeroccino. They will even make you a small, NOT sampler, BUT legit CUP of Nespresso espresso to your liking complete with lid. There is a queue and was a line that went pretty swiftly. The staff is knowledgable and friendly. My info was in the system and yours will be too after your first purchase or if you have ordered before. I am excited that all I have to do is drive , park, walk in and buy... oh and I can drop my used pods off for recycling and get my fresh recycling Nespresso bags here too... AAANNNDD!! I get more caffeine to sip while buying yet more caffeine to take home for my needs ! No shaking in waiting ... just coffee before talky!

Dr. Pulley and staff are in a word, amazing! As many people, I am terrified of anything dental. NOT because I don't take care of my teeth, I do! But even down to the water jet cleaning of my teeth, I just want it over and immediately yesterday. That said, I found Dr. Pulley when I moved across the valley via great reviews and word of mouth. Upon calling his office, it was the Dr. himself that answered! I was in shock, because that never happens! He was so kind and warm and apologetic because at the time one of his staff members was in the midst of getting married and he said he was also answering phones to help out his staff.. I was sold on his kindness alone. Judy, his admin, called me that week and told me all about Dr. Pulley and fit me and my fiancé in with a schedule to fit both our busy lives. When we got to our cleaning day, it was flawless and best.. painless! Dr. Pulley was down to earth, professional and advised what was needed in future visits. His staff is awesome too. There are headphones and music so you don't have to listen to that water jet thing or any of the grinding tools on said teeth! Yay for non painful pearly visits!

I am so happy that Chelsea's Kitchen is in the place I practically live! I am happy to see good eats come to the airport. I have been happy with every thing here ... In fact, they have the best French dip sandwich in the valley, in my opinion. It's cut thin and yet still a little rare .. Perfect. It reminds me of the perfect French dips in Nor Cali that I grew up with. I generally always get that with the kale salad as a side. I've had the tacos too.. Yum. The service can go either way; I try to keep in mind it's an airport so knowing how irritated passengers can be at airports with all they are put thru to fly, I try and keep that in mind for the staff that has to deal with ... Well, often rude, stressed passengers. I have not been to the bar area, as I am generally here in uniform and wings and that is a no no. But my boyfriend has met me here and loves the sangria. If it's like the sangria at the main Chelsea's Kitchen then I would guess it's pretty great. Cool ambience and a lively atmosphere.

Love LGO. Trendy, fast and a cute little breakfasty, brunchy joint on the weekends. Love all the coffee selections. The fact that you can even grab a Reisling from the refrigerator and hang out at the table and share! Tammie Coe cakes is also the baker of little fattening delicacies for the person you may have left home! Pizzas are yummy.. Salads even yummier and packaged to go, say if your a girl like me.. on the go.. on the fly! Parking is awful. Literally you may have to wait and mame to get a place on the weekends! Park up the street and walk!

Always a 5 at this Drybar! What's not to love about a complete girly place decked in yellow and white where you are pampered from enter to blow to finish ? I've been to Drybar in other parts of the US when I just don't want to primp and even attempt to get my long locks complete and in place for hours ... Enter the talent of Drybar ! I've never waited past my appointment time and I love that you can book from your phone via a Drybar app! This is by far my favorite Drybar in the west coast region. On NYE my bestie and I went early to start our pre-New Years Pregaming early. In our yoga pants and ski beanies we showed up looking less than 'fly'. You are offered cold beverages of your liking ! Anything !! I mean that!!! We stuck with our nonfat Capps from next door and cucumber infused waters to keep our faces de-puffy for later! Cookies are there... Another no to that . But what a treat if you want or need a sweet ! Within about an hour we both left with long , luscious locks (Cosmo and Mai Tai blown) that lasted well into the wee hours past the toll of midnight at our NYE masquerade party! Because that's how buttered Drybar girls roll! Thank you Alli Webb for creating this concept of blow dry and pampering the locks of us spoiled ones! It's a treat for My little girl and her friends too, btw! Products available there but no pressure or upselling. This is not a typical 'salon' experience. It's unique and def a girls day, fun day for special nights or days out!

Another FOX Concepts eatery/drinkery. The sister of Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale; it's on the same level. Except I was surprised at the patio area; it's huge! Nice open space and warm fire pits all around. On a Thursday evening about 6:00pm there was about a 15 minute wait; so solve that by scrunching in at the bar. Yep. Crowded is good; and the bar was crowded too. I got a bit confused on the drink menu with the pricing of the wines. I ended up ordering a Pinot that was $15 for a glass thinking in my blonde mind that 15g meant the pour size ! Oops!! My boyfriend is a simple beer guy and loves the idea of the $2 beer in a bag concept. You order the beer in a bag and don't know what your getting : PBR;Hamms;Natty Ice ? Yeah don't think your getting a swanky craft brew in a bag! You can upgrade the bag with a shot , or a mini to go with. Same idea , you never know the beer nor the shot ! Yeah it's a cool idea, but I'll pass! Loved the charcuterie plate that you can build on your own with choices of cheeses, olives or artichokes and dried meats .. Whatever you like! The pretzel balls and fondue are always a 'must ' and these are exact to the CD in Scottsdale. Awesome service and ambience. Trendy and fun. Free valet too. Just be cautious of the drink menu, or psy attention , unlike me!

I am in love with The Yard! When we have a fun guest in town, this has just become our 'go to' place to take them! This particular night was an old fraternity brother from my boyfriends college days. What's better than taking him to The Yard for some good loud fun and a beer in a bag and good bites too. Heck, if he is really feeling like getting nostalgic, there are even bags to play out in .. well, what else, the 'yard', or the big vast patio, where we always opt to sit. We always Uber it here because the drinks are strong and well, drink accordingly, if you plan to drink. I don't much these days, but I still may and this is the place to try out some of your 'vices'. Know that you will likely wait. We have no issues bellying up to the bar. The staff is always friendly and the most we have ever waited is about 35 minutes. It's a great time to socialize and talk. My boyfriend and his frat brother opted for the beer in the bag special, $2, let them relive their college memories for at least a good ten minutes! I stuck with my water and lemon for now because I wanted to have one 'vice' for the evening and sleep well! We have our favorites now at The Yard. We always get the fondue and pretzel balls. If you haven't; you must. I love the deviled eggs too, but not everyone does. So this time we got the house potato chips with the TO die for french onion dip. I had personally not had this app before and it was good; fattening beyond words, when you add the pretzels and fondue, but worth it! NOW I decided I needed a drink. I decided to get out of my wine comfort zone and have a real cocktail. I ordered a mule type of drink called a, Ginger and Mary Ann. A concoction I loved a little too much of Stoli vodka, fruited smash, lime squeeze, and topped with ginger beer. Yum. Yum. But, one is enough. I had the shaved prime rib and a side salad for dinner; heavenly. The prime rib is done just right at medium rare and I am so picky about this, I always ask! I left with half to eat the next day. Must have been those heavenly pretzels, I can't get enough of! I love the vibe and energy of The Yard and it has fast become one of my favorite places in Phoenix. Our friend was a fan too and we were able to put him on his plane back to North Carolina with a full belly and a fun time in the books!

I seem to have a thing for pigs... in this case , she claims to be blind! So what. This swine has amazing taste , ambience and service ! Just like her Uncle Sal, next door . On a recent visit with a group of friends I have to admit that the name threw me off: Blind Pig , you say? Well! It doesn't sound Mexican! Do not judge a cantina by its namesake. Or a pig by her ummm ethnicity ?? After all, Uncle Sal is Italian! Upon entering, we were seated in the corner of this rather small, but cute and quaint place and promptly greeted by our waitress who gave us ideas on drinks and the once over on the specials. She was super patient with our loud group, ( seriously .. we were noisy.) My drink was the Paloma Fresca  : a light , citrusy margarita type cocktail  , with the buzz of a grapefruit spritz. It was good, light and refreshing. I ordered the Crab/Mango/Avocado  Stack. Okay. Mind. Blown. For $9.. this very robust stack of just what it describes! It was more than enough to share amongst us and still have not eaten it all!! LOADS of crab !! Being from California , I can appreciate how pricey crab recently has been . I was in shock at how good it was ; fresh and how much was on this appetizer for such a low price! My entree : I had a tough time deciding because the menu is full of really , good snd inexpensive fresh items ! I went with the Shrimp Tamale as my entree because it was different. It comes as one tamale with a few shrimp on top and a creamy sauce. It's rich! Don't think because it's only one you won't get enough ,  as you will! My husband ordered the Guacamole and Salsa combo to start and again: Soooo good and enough to share ! Cheap beers; a great wine list; great margs and amazing food. The waitress was so friendly throughout our night here with our loud table and our groups indecisiveness and all of us asking so many questions of her ! She never lost it! Kudos to her! Our dinner group is a bit much , at times!! Can't wait for another reason to visit this cute blind swine ...and her nice patio before the hot summer hits!

This may end up in my fave restaurants list. A group of us went here for our little dinner club one night. It's a cute, farmhouse feel with a cool bar and open kitchen and I'm not gonna lie, we chose this because I love the name : Salty Sow. It's different and almost comfort food amped up. As in, the pig has style, so make her fancy for the night. That's what I love. The chef twists a simple pork shoulder and makes it a little more fancied and decks it out in a little cast iron pot. We had sangria, margaritas,  a old fashioned and wine with dinner. Our apps were the deviled eggs and fritters. We know how to represent the piggy kingdom! My mom had the halibut and it was divine. We ordered the biscuits, as well. No one left hungry or dissatisfied; in fact we all loved it. Our waiter was sweet, attentive and knew his drinks and menu very well. I have some food allergies and he made sure to explain how it could be, well, fixed to this swines seemingly picky ways. We shared the bananas foster beignets.. A must but a 'must share' because they are sweet and rich. Oink. Oink.

My friend works for NASCAR ... The week leading up to race weekend ... He decided to whisk me away for a getaway on my vacation month... We had VIP check in in the HRH Tower.Loved the spacious room... The beautiful bathroom... The Love Notes Order In Room Service ... That's pretty cool, if you are feeling naughtily so inclined to be cuffed ! The beds are super  comfy ....like melting into something that you just should.... Not to hard... not too soft... If you know what I mean...:-) And that is always a good thing... I fell in love with the lotion...& wanted to know where to get more & the very sweet maid handed off a ton to me when I ran out in the hall to ask her where I could purchase it... I still need to know where to order this lotion though! Hard Rock to me is an enclave off the strip.. Almost like  the cool kids club... I originally thought I'd miss not being at my MGM and in the center of it all... But the HR is so happening it didn't matter. There are lots of eateries .. You can't go wrong with the Pink Taco.. Or late night drunchies at Lucky 7... The many bars in the center . We had a private Denali and a awesome driver, Ron, take us over to Club Hyde @ The Bellagio one of our nights here as my cool friends apparently had the hook up:-) However, you truly don't have to ever leave the HR because whatever you want that is cool and trending is here... Vanity and Rehab... The pools and cabanas are beautiful.. & then stumble back up to your room.. For some of those love notes ...or the mini bar... Or the bed?! Remember to hang the 'Tied Up' on the door...  Gotta love Vegas Baby..:-)

After attending a Yelp brunch event at EVO last month, I wanted to come back and try dinner here. We decided to host my husbands boss and his wife here and that also would give us the chance to come back. We decided to arrive early and try the happy hour before the boss arrived. I love the setting and decor of EVO, which is dimly lit, lots of candles, music just the right volume and not blasting your eardrums off, and the exposed wood and brick mixed with red textiles give it a chic, classy feel. The bathrooms are clean; a lot can be said about the cleanliness of a restaurant depending on the cleanliness of the restroom.  EVO's bar has a great happy hour menu. Happy Hour runs from 4-7pm. I like to take notice of happy hours that are worthy! I will have to put this on my Yelp happy hour list! Wait for that! The EVO Happy Hour has really mouthwatering starters that are by NO means small in portion, at least for what we ordered. We started with the Bruschetta of the Day, which is a daily chef inspired bruschetta, (thats fun!) made of ricotta, a little honey, and apricot, topped upon perfectly toasted housemade bread. The boss arrived and he and his wife ordered the Arancini, which was three large balls made of risotto with red sauce over them. Seriously, you could make this a side with a pasta for a meal! There was also an Italian Sweet Corn that was ordered. When it arrived there were four small ears of corn with the perfect spices and oil drizzled over the warm ears. I can not eat corn but it smelled heavenly! On the Happy Hour menu, $3 drafts and bottled beers; $4 well drinks; $5 tap wine, (which I have always turned my nose to, but since my husband ordered a Pinot off the tap, I tried it and stopped my snootiness there!) and $7 specialty cocktails. That is ANY specialty cocktail off the menu. The other thing that not all places do during happy hour is allow you to order off the happy hour menu at the table, but when we moved with the boss and his wife to our reserved table from the bar, the waiter greeted us and told us that the happy hour was still going and we could have that at the table. Nice!  Dinner time! I had a glass of cava to start and to finish our appetizers off with. I like the wine menu being so expansive and with at least a few bubbly's that you can order by the glass, since I am selfishly, a bubbly girl but can not do a whole bottle by myself. (Okay. I can. But I should not).The waiter was on point and made suggestions to us based on our tastes and his own personal favorites and the 'why' he liked them, as well. It was hard to decide. I would not say that this menu, being Italian, is what I would call, 'Old School Italian', such as lasagna or alfredo sauced fettuccines, which are not on this menu, but I liked it! The menu does not overwhelm you with choices. There is a fish of the day and a beef. Both sound amazing! Maybe next time! I came for pasta! I had the Squid Ink Chittara. The squid ink may throw some off but let me say this, its mainly for aesthetic purpose. In other words, you do not taste squid. This dish was something so different for me but considering myself a 'foodie', I had to try it! Long, thin dark purple squid ink noodles are tossed with a uni butter and chile for a little spicy kick, then topped with lumps of white crab, a little scallion and a little breadcrumb and a few sautéed cherry plum tomatoes. It was a perfect portion for me. My one small complaint, I would have liked to have seen more lump crab. It was a small, small portion and I would be willing to pay more to see even 1/4 cup of it. I know its a rough season for crab in California, so maybe that is it. No matter. I loved this dish! Its different and today i wanted more, but I had no leftovers! My husbands dish was the Pappardelle that had a red ragu sauce with lots of beef, veal and pork, just like a good ragu sauce should have. I loved his too! One nice touch would be for the waiter to bring fresh parmesan and have large spoons served with the bowls of pasta for twisting the pasta.  You can get bread to go with all this pasta too, on the menu as Noble Bread Service. NOT that we needed any more yummy-ness!  Dessert! My husband can not seem to try a new restaurant with out sharing a dessert. EVO has an amazing 'hard to choose just one', dessert menu! He ordered the Warm Butter Cake. I am not sure if that is the correct name, but the long and short of it is that it is a ample serving of a warm, dense butter cake served atop a creme anglaise and topped with whipped cream. It's warm, rich, sinful and heavenly all at once. Today we are officially juicing after this amazing meal at EVO.  I am glad we had a reason to come back for dinner. I love the area of town that EVO is in, as it is a good starting point for a weekend night in Old Town and even a good ending point with its great bar and drinks. I am officially a fan!

A group of about 15 of us decided to stop in at Maya for our friends birthday. All dressed well, you know, in the way that will get you past THE velvet rope in Scottsdale, that is. Initially we were told with a bottle service our cover would be $25. That's funny. NEVER have I had that anywhere in the US, Europe, Asia or on the God's creation with a bottle service. Wow. A bottle service doesn't usually have any cover attached. My boyfriend who was paying for said bottle service and 'negotiated' $10 for the guys; I was ready to can this place and move on. I personally like The W. You get a bottle ahead of time and they let you in. No cover; no questions; and let's just be honest, if you are gonna be picky with the velvet rope there, Mr. Velvet Rope Boy, you and your co-horts should at least dress the part. None of them matched. In fact, on a given night they would probably not be let into the finest dive bars in S Phoenix. IF they can be that picky, so can I. :-) Yes. This review is about to get Yelp responsible.  Seriously. Take your class and save it. Go somewhere with class and your hard earned bodies and nice clothing and money and spend it in a place that is worth it. There are so many clubs in Scottsdale, where you will be appreciated and treated well, whether you spring for the VIP bottle service or not. I may even create a DB list on my page and this place will top it. To continue.. Once our group gets in, (mind you with several of us not wanting to go in and venture onward, however, it's a group and our buddies birthday), and my boyfriends credit card had been run three times for the initial bottle service within ten minutes of being inside the door. He immediately gets a fraud alert from his bank! I should have paid attention to the other Yelp reviews before even thinking of letting him use his card at this douche baggery place of such charm. That was squashed fast. Of course, the waitress wanted his signature and he laughed and told her , 'nah, I don't think so... NOT until I take a call from my bank about the fraud alert I just received!', to which she rolled her eyes. ( Yeah most of us caught that... too bad her tip is rolled into that bottle service). At that point, it was decided once he figured and worked out the bank issue and let Maya people know, that no second or third bottles would be purchased. We opted to leave and go elsewhere and purchase from the bars on the side. Issues with the bottle service. The waitress left the cap OFF the bottle of Ciroc after initially serving us. There was no security to our VIP area; people not in our group were all over our table area. Is that safe? NO! NOT with a bottle that is uncapped and glasses of drinks poured! Are you kidding me???? Maya you are a complete fail and waste. We won't be back. Never will we not stick with what we know and that is what works... those clubs always get 4-5 stars from us both. If I could give you a 0 that is what you would get.

This was a perfect place to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night! We decided we would arrive about 445pm to attempt to  settle in before the celebratory rush would ensue..  and somehow as our luck was with us!.. Our party waited less than 20 minutes for a table! After that! The queue to get in was very long! I had forgotten how lovely this place is on the inside. The old church windows and some having excerpts from the Bible give it a very eclectic feel. The decor is just so cool and you find yourself looking around at all the windows and ceilings and murals! We were sat in the back room of the building and immediately there were chips and a variety of salsas on the table; waters too! I like that. In my previous review, I noted not liking the chips and salsas, but tonight I loved them! The variety of the salsas ranged from hot, to one that was a bit fruity, to a more chunky, garlic version. Happy hour here is great! Tonight was special drink that was a Paloma type cocktail with grapefruit; champagne; cerveza and Roger Clyne tequila.. and a wedge of grapefruit too.. fruity and fresh for $5. The management of Taco Guild was having a cool little contest for anyone who took part in this fresh libation: name the drink and if your entry is chosen, get a $50 Taco Guild gift card. In! Thats a few tacos and margs! Speaking of margs! The 1893 Margarita is their version of a 'house' margarita. $5 on happy hour! AND, its really, REALLY good! NOT too sweet and not too tart. I asked if this was smaller than the regular menu one, that is still a great deal at a $7.98, and our waiter said they were the same size. Happy Hour Monday thru Friday is 400-700pm. There is also a reverse happy hour later at night AND on weekends.. MOST of the day. Can anyone say, "Sunday Funday?!" The Brunch Menu looks fab and so do the Brunch Cocktails. Breakfast Beer?!   The 'Daily Taco' is a daily unique street taco of greatness available during the weekday from 300-700p and late night for a cool $1.99! Because this was Cinco de Mayo, we started with a round of drinks for all in our party and some starters: The Guild Duo: Housemade, fresh guacamole and amazing green chile queso that comes served warm over a tea light.. like a fondue. Seriously so good! We also started with the Diablo Eggs: Taco Guilds spin on a deviled egg that has a bit of serrano pepper, truffle oil and topped with a longaniza sausage to give it just enough kick. You get an ample serving of six of these! So, so tasty! Because this was my cheat day, I was seriously about to cheat my way through this with carbs and tequila! My entree was the Chicken Enchiladas. These enchiladas were so FULL of chicken and goodies that I was full half way through the first one and ended up giving my husband the other one! House made corn tortillas are filled with annatto braised shredded chicken, just enough jack cheese, green chile and tomatillo sauce. They are topped off with a bit of cojita cheese and corn and a drizzle of sour cream. The beans that are served with these are out of this world; NOT refried! This super filling entree is just under $10! I also had to try the Daily Taco. I can not tell you what it is! Not because I had a margarita, (okay, I actually had two!), but because even after I asked our waiter to repeat it twice, I could not remember! It was shredded pork and it was marinated in tequila! That's all I needed to know. Super delicious. Despite the fact that was a crazy, busy day for any restaurant serving tacos and tequila.. our waiter did not try to 'churn and burn' us out the door. We were given fresh chips and more salsa to go with the numerous drink orders coming from our group. He never let our waters go dry and apologized for the 'wait' , (not really a wait, at all!), for our drinks since it was Cinco de Mayo. The live music started in the bar around 5pm and it made the ambiance a lot of fun!  I decided to delve into the history of Taco Guild after dining here last night . The Taco Guild building history is pretty neat!  Fun Fact: The lot that the Taco Guild sits on was purchased for $30 to build a church. When construction began in 1893, it evolved into a one room schoolhouse named Osborn School. A year later it opened as a church and remained that way until 2012 when the property was deconsecrated. Taco Guild uses local farms for its produce for freshness and flavor.  The use of 'up cycled' plates kind of goes along with the history of the building and what you have when you dine here :  a story. This is the downtown place for trend, mixed with history, great service and amazing food and drinks!

Sometimes you just want a great pizza with a great atmosphere to go with it. I have found a new favorite in central PHX in Pomo Pizzeria.  The place is perfect to me from the cute, small bar off to the side with Italian sodas, wines, beers and hand made cocktails , to the open kitchen concept , to the lovely patio on a Spring night with a view of the Italian Vespas parked against the curb .. TO the owners accent! , ( yes , I said that ), and of course the authentic Naples seal of authenticity pizze on the tasteful hand tossed pies!  So, after a Prosecco and Italian Mojito, a sparkly mist or Prosecco meets Mojito, at the cozy, friendly bar inside Pomo, we were shown to our patio table and greeted by the owner. We decided to order a Italian charcuterie and Italian cheese board called the Affettati Misti, that was complete with olives and bread and EVOO, that could have easily served as a dinner! During our brief wait for our appetizer and chianti , we took the owners recommendation on pizza and ordered NOT one pizza , BUT two. Hungry much , there chunk kids?! He recommended the Pizza Chef: a Blanche  (white) pizze with Italian prosciutto, Parma cheese, basil, mushrooms and Creme all atop the amazing, cooked to perfection Pomo crust that makes the pizza so amazingly delectable. We also ordered a Carbonara Pizze . It was another white pizza with pancetta, Creme, Italian cheeses, and eggs .. I also added ricotta and artichoke hearts. Carbonara is the dish of Rome, Italy known for the mixture of cream, bacon and eggs. I fell in love with the taste while in Roma a few weeks ago and this pizza did not disappoint when housing these Roma ingredients atop the perfect crust. I see now why Pomo gets that special certification from the APN ( Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) and the VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana) in Napoli, Italy. It's the most amazing crust I've had outside of Italy! Needless to say , we left with more than an entire pizze between the two pies we ordered and much of the antipaste plate too!  After dinner we were too stuffed to attempt to partake in one of the delightful looking dessert options; I do love me a good Panna Cotta! BUT, being in Europe a lot of the past three months is widening my waist line and I have to pass on some delights , especially if ordering TWO pizzas!  Well. NOT so fast! The wonderful, engaging owner came around with HOUSE made Limoncello and little delicate fried dough pieces doused in powdered sugars to end this wonderful Italy in Arizona dinner! BEST Limoncello EVER! it's so creamy and lemony ! I really wanted to buy a bottle!  Pomo Napoletana completely won me over ! I can't wait to have more reasons to go back..

Pomo is hands down the ONE pizza that I crave with a vengeance. About a year ago I set out to try other up and coming pizzerias in the valley and try my own sort of self proving standard against what I thought was the ultimate high bar that Pomo had unknowingly set.. a complete ten on the pizza level in my world of taste buds. I have yet to find it here. There are some truly great pizzerias here in Phoenix and Scottsdale, don't get me wrong! BUT none of them compare to Pomo. The crust is what makes the pizza here so delightfully perfect in ones mouth! The crust on every pizza I've had here has an authenticity hard to find outside of Italy. Oh wait!  They have that special authentic Naples seal, after all!:  The APN, Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani and the VPN , Verace Pizza Napoletana. Do the research on those earned and coveted culinary seals and you will see that they are true Naples, Italy certifications for amazing! My very favorite pizza is the Pizza Chef. A white pie of prosciutto, basil, mushrooms, parma cheese and crema all topped on that amazing crust that is perfect and crisp to the bite. AND, I can't resist always starting with the Affettati Misti, Pomo's charcuterie and Italian cheese board that comes olives and their amazing house made bread. Don't be taken aback if you find yourself having to wait for a table. You likely will. While you wait, Pomo has a great, yet small, bar and an amazing bartender too. David will figure out your wants for libations and make sure you are happy ! The wine list is awesome here. The Italian cocktails are unique and fresh. Who doesn't like an Italian mojito because it has prosecco added?! The patio here is fun and dog friendly; there are sometimes Italian Vespas parked out front to look at .. or jazz up your Instagram feed! Sometimes after perusing the PHX Public Market, I have found myself on the Pomo patio for an afternoon cocktail and lunch! I have always been too full to partake in any of the desserts here at Pomo.. I keep promising myself to box up some of the pizza and order a Panna Cotta! Know that you will be treated very well by Pomo staff and the management, as well. If you are here in the evening, it is not out of the ordinary to get a gratis Limoncello to top off your amazing meal. It is house made and served in a shot glass. Not to be taken like a shot because it is to be savored like the delight it is: lemony and creamy. The fried pieces of dough doused in sweet sugar are pretty good to finish off the meal too. The vibe here is friendly, fun and trendy. Worth the wait for amazing pizza! My very favorite pizza quite possibly.. outside of Italy! Whats better .. they are legit Italians here!

I love this place! I wish it was closer to our house. But it's not. So we have to pace ourselves when we make the trek out here! Fave brews: Big Guy Rye; Little Guy Rye; BWBW (Bear Wallow Berliner Weisse) My absolute go to brew! AND in the fall we made it out for the Pecan Pie Porter. Brett (one of the owners) explained all that went into the brewing of this fantastic porter. ALOT! It's a treat. This brewery is not your typical and I love that. It's clean and all the brews are skillfully crafted. Build your own  burger. We have had the brisket and the chicken and you add your own flair with cheeses, sauces, toppings and the bun, even. We share because its a big one! Love the pretzels and cheese too! My only downfall is they are a little heavy on the salt. I scratch it off and none left. Not a problem! Get a growler of your favorite brew because know this, if it turns out to be a favorite, it won't last long! No worries, another one will be along soon to tempt your brew taste buds!

This Vig is now in the running with my favorite Vig in Arcadia! On our way to Cibo to take my daughter for her favorite pizza in Phx, we pull in to valet and find here we are at this Vig. Mistake but we opt to check it out instead of Cibo. LOVE the spacious patio! We sat inside but that patio has potential for awesomeness! I love the salad with shrimp and prickly pear dressing in the summer... it's pure lightness and just enough. My daughter wanted the sliders and to try out the cheesy filled tater tots, which 3 of us split, as they are rich. Good! BUT rich! The staff is always spot on and I know this place will and already is amazing as all the Vig's are. Being able to valet in such a busy area of town is a plus. Can't wait to go back and check out the patio on a Sunday Funday!

Pizza People Pub wow'd me last night .. but it wasn't just the pizza that wow'd me. After wanting to try PPP for awhile now, I figured a cool day in Phoenix was a great time to stop in and check out the reason this place always looks so busy. Upon entering Pizza People Pub, I immediately loved the decor: Big black wing chairs at the tables; orange couches around tables and trendy high top tables; the art on the wall and dim lights just set the mood for a chic and trendy place with a laid back atmosphere. The patio is lit with clear lights , patio heaters for the cooler months and is very cute and open.  PPP has a great happy hour and a drink special daily. Todays special drink of the day was a mojito for $4! I like to have wine with my pizza and even though the menu has more than just pizzas, I knew I wanted pizza and wine tonight. That said, my hubby ordered the mojito. This drink didn't come in the usual 'small glass because its on special or happy hour' type glass, this mojito was tall! It was served in a pint glass; hand shaken and made fresh. $5 wines on happy hour and the beer and wine menu are filled with options for anyones taste. As I already mentioned, PPP has not only pizza here, but as the name suggests: Pub fare. There are sandwiches, great salads, and some amazing appetizers. PPP also has a very wide selection what I like to call , 'grown up' mac and cheese selections that aren't the kind of mac and cheese your momma used to make! Pizza People Pub has mac and cheese on the menu with truffle oil; jalepeno; or a Korean sweet and spicy to intrigue your grown up taste buds; they also come in a mini 8 ounce size or a biggie 20 ounce serving! Mmmmmmm  Tonight we opted for two pizzas to share. We figured that was the name and our first time here should be all about tasting the tempting pies. I ordered the Fun Guy. I tend to go for 'white' pizzas when out for a gourmet pizza experience and this one was nothing short of divine. The Fun Guy was a base of mozzarella, mushrooms, and truffle oil over an amazing crust that was a bit garlic-y in taste and perfectly baked not too crisp and not un-done. The Fun Guy on the PPP menu comes with arugula, but I am not really into arugula on my pizzas, so I asked that be deleted and added with prosciutto. I loved my Fun Guy! My husband ordered The Manny. Manny is different, but in a good way! It tantalizes your taste buds with a base of red sauce, a jalepeno cream cheese, pepperoni, onion and bacon and topped with fresh avocado slices. All pizzas are 10 inches in size and range from about $9.95 to $12.25 which isn't bad considering they are made fresh artisan style from a family recipe, hand tossed, made with fresh sustainable ingredients and baked in stone decked ovens. There are also gluten free options available. I like having that option too. At one point there was only one pizza place in Phoenix that offered gluten free pizza and anyone with dietary restrictions, well, was restricted on being able to enjoy pizza! Both my husband and I left being very full and having leftovers for the next day.  I really loved Pizza People Pub, its atmosphere, its bar and its location in the downtown Central Phoenix area. Our waiter, JP, was great. He was super polite, informative, he never let our water glasses go empty, which is super important to me, and was always smiling and on his waiter game the entire time. There is ample free parking and again, I really liked the specials advertised. I really must come back and try more of what PPP has to offer. The dessert menu looked amazing, but we were so full on pizza, dessert would have put us into a food coma right there and we would have been napping on one of those cozy, inviting couches for the night!  Pizza People.. you did good! See you again soon!

I may now be a squealing pig because I have found THE gem for wines and craft beers in Phoenix! I have had this place bookmarked for so long on my 'must try' list on Yelp and just keep passing it by. This past week while out with my hard to meet up lately, husband, who conveniently works very near The Whining Pig, we decided.. let's finally try this place! At about 930pm on a Thursday night, this little tucked in place was packed.. AS in standing room only packed! That's always a good sign! We luckily were able to grab two places at the bar right in the eye view of the greatest bar tender I've met in a long time. Clay, immediately introduced himself to us ! NO bartender does that ! Especially when they are busy. The wines and beers are all listed on a giant black chalkboard on the opposing wall from us , but he asked us what we were into. I'm kind of a wine snob, so I'm into everything ! I chose a great priced 2011 Grand Bordeaux from the board and my love, always up for any craft brew, opted for the even better priced $4 White Bag Special; the idea is that whatever the bartender grabs, is what the white bag is! He ended up with a New Belgium 1554 Black Lager first and then a Maui Brewing Co. Doppleshot Doublebock. He had fun trying to taste and guess the beer and talk to Clay, the bartender, about what it may be. Fun! $4!! I thought I was in for a second glass and Clay asked if I liked a full bodied wine.. I do! He gave me a sample of a rare Cab from France, which I loved and attempted a glass of. But this was not our first stop of the evening, it was after a dinner out that had included wine.. and hence, a quarter glass in, I felt bad leaving it! There are great noshs like charcuterie boards here, grilled cheeses and desserts! Lots of games to interact with , if you would like all hanging around on the bar. I like it. It's hipster, trendy, has a great atmosphere with music; its small, it's cute and a locals hit! I love a great wine bar .. Scott loves a great beer place. Can't wait to come back and hang with Clay again ! Seriously, this guy never let our water or wine run dry! He was busy and it did not phase him a bit.. he interacted with everyone .. loved it ! Like I said .. a gem this place is!!

Great Vietnamese cuisine in the devils playground ? You ask? PHO shizzle! I was very surprised by Slanted Rice Vietnamese Bistro a couple of weeks ago when a group of friends all landed from our various business trips for that particular week and met up for our monthly dinner outing to catch up with each other like we do someplace we haven't tried for drinks and of course , food!  Having grown up near the Bay Area, I know pho , PHO sho! , AND, have yet to really, REALLY, be blown away by any of the Vietnamese places here in the valley.  Slanted Rice is housed in the Hilton Village ; It's trendy ; chic and when you step inside, the vibe is cool; the mixology of drinks don't disappoint either. In fact, my Knees Bees Martini , a lovely libation of lavender honey gin, honey simple syrup, Yuzu, lemon and a smidgen of pomegranate will get you slanted , if your not mindful of your sips! It was stirred perfectly : not too sweet and not too tart and what I needed to end my week with. They have sake on tap; several brews, including Ichiban and Sapporo and a great, different drink menu with unique cocktails, as well as the usual beer and wines by the pint or glass.  Upon ordering our starters, we shared the Tom, (shrimp), Spring Rolls served with peanut sauce. It was a generous serving and I could seriously see myself grabbing an order to go for a later lunch since I love Vietnamese spring rolls so much. I loved that the waitress brought a selection of ramekins of sauces also for the dishes we ordered, as I like chile sauce on my rolls for some kick. The Slanted Pho is a great starter too, in fact, if you're like me and find the pho is always SO much to eat! , this is the perfect amount of Pho for the smaller eater: make it your main meal! A smaller bowl of the entree version.  My dinner entree was the Crispy Rice in a Clay Pot , (Com Tay Cam), with Shrimp. So unique! The entree comes out in a , ( you guessed it!), hot cast iron clay pot . VERY hot, in fact, to give the rice the crispness. The rice at bottom is topped with shiitake mushrooms , bok choy and the shrimp , (or the meat , seafood or veggie of your choice ), and this perfect amount of flavorful sauce. I don't think I would order this particular entree as a take out option, however, as the rice would, (as my leftovers did ), lose their crispy texture. My boyfriend , ( who became my fiancée on this night!) , ordered the entree Pho. Holy bowls! Maximum pho! This is one large bowl of Pho served ! He can never decide on one item so he got the combination of steak , meatballs , tenderloin, and flank steak. Loaded with broth and noodles and lots of meats .. and yes. He over ordered. Go figure. The Shaken Beef, ( Com Bo Luc Lac ),  is also a entree I'll try again. Tender, tender filet mignon served on a hot cast iron rectangular plate of sizzling onions and a side of freshly steamed rice. The Prawns with Garlic Noodles , ( Tom Nuong Va Mi Toi), was another favorite; a lot of large, nice prawns housed in these amazingly, garlic'd noodles. MMMMM.  All of our dinner entrees came with a bowl of scallion broth and small green salad with a miso ginger dressing. Needless to say, you won't leave Slanted Rice Bistro hankering for more. You will leave with leftovers if you were like us and over ordered to sample a bunch of different things.  I left this dinner outing, with a new blingy diamond on my left hand! The staff here was all in on it, ( as were our friends) and made the night fun and very special. IF I were to change anything , I would recommend later hours, particularly on weekends; this place has all the elements of a great bar so why not capitalize on that? 900pm closure on a Friday is just a tad odd to me .... But really, the food, unique menu and great bar and ambience give Slanted Rice a perfect 5 ...

I love Blanco Tacos and Tequila in Scottsdale for their fresh ingredient menu as well as the outside firepits and patio! Now that there is a Blanco at Biltmore,  I was anxious to see how this location fared against the Scottsdale one. I was not let down.  My best friend., Jeran and I decided Blanco was perfect during some impulsive shopping in Biltmore Fashion Park and we noticed, NOT only was it Taco Tuesday, BUT, it was happy hour!! Double win! We started with freshly made margaritas and the Blanco's Famous freshly made guacamole off the half off happy hour menu. HALF OFF!!! You can't go wrong with a margarita, guac, and gossip on a hot summer day in the desert!   I am blown away by the quantity of tequila choices at Blanco. From blanco to anejo to reposado to ultra tequilas, and even a couple of mezcals for the super brave! There are more than fifty plus types of tequila to line up with your salt and lime. Impressive! I had not ever paid attention to all the variety before and it's important for any place highlighting 'tequila' in it's title. If it were a weekend night , this would be one place to begin , or end the fun. Because we all know what tequila does !? Our waiter was very helpful in suggesting what tequila to match our tastes and for our choice of margaritas.The margaritas on the menu are 'built' with a certain tequila, but you are able to change them up, if you would like. Good to know!  He also kept us hydrated with never allowing our h2o to go beyond half empty ... Or half full? I opted for the White Peach and Hibiscus margarita and my buddy stuck with his usual , the  Classic marg. Yum with a caramba! Thank Jose we had more shopping at Biltmore to do, as that libation went down way too fast and too smoothly...   As far as food, I had the Seafood Salad. Full of fresh veggies and jicama;   I added grilled shrimp to it, as well. Not heavy on the dressing, and it honestly didn't need it with as loaded and tasty as the salad was. Perfect!  Jeran had a Carne Asada Burrito, which I swear he was so picky in ordering, I can't remember what he ended up with, (or maybe that was the tequila again?) ; But when it arrived, he was happy!   The waiter, again, never missed a beat and we both walked away with NO tacos on Tuesday , ( I think it's original  reason we wanted Blanco on this day??!) again... Tequila ! But we did walk away to shop tipsy ...full and happy! Yay! Hasta luego Blanco .. Until we meet again! Maybe for that Taco Tuesday??

I have not been to a FRC yet that I have not loved! Since I used to live in this area, this is where I often come back to for trendy dining and watering hole options. I had been wanting to try The Henry for some time now and a girls night last week lead us here, finally!  Apparently we entered into the less crowded area right of the coffee bar thinking we were sneaky in beating the crowded door. Ha! After being by passed by the wait staff a few times, one of us got up and went to the bar to see why. Well, duh. We were in the coffee area! Silly girls. We moved to the crowded area and started our wait like everyone else when some sharply dressed guys took pity on us and offered up their high table. Nice! We were quickly greeted by a friendly waitress who cleaned and dried the table. A plus, because anyone who is a frequent diner knows this doesn't always happen and you end up that way! This waitress was informative, spot on with her service, sweet and attentive.  We started out with the Vodka and Pulp from the intriguing cocktail menu that features fresh cocktails and even a handful of soda and juice mixology's that are sans alcohol. Perfect for the one third of us that is starting her family. For the other two thirds of us: The Vodka and Pulp was a refreshing mix of Ketel One vodka muddled with a citrus orange press and topped with club soda served up so nicely in a tall glass. Perfect on a hot desert day! The Red Stiletto was as pretty as it sounded. Belvedere vodka mixed with grenadine and cherry bitters in a old fashioned champagne glass.  We moved on to our starter of the Wood Grilled Artichoke. The artichoke is grilled to perfection to the middle of the tender heart and served with a perfect truffle alioli. It could easily be shared or as a meal for one. My friends ordered the Short Rib Potstickers with ponzu and sesame. There were four of them and they raved over how good they were. Our main meal consisted of us all ordered the Roasted Turkey French Dip. I had the kale salad as side and again, that was a hit. I even took half the sandwich home for the next days lunch.  The wifi was fast and had a strong signal the entire time we were there. That is a plus, as no one can be far from their smart phones or emails these days.  I would loved if The Henry had valet parking because it was seriously hard to find parking on a busy Thursday night. Again, a first world problem! That is not enough to deter me from coming back to The Henry and trying out the coffee bar and more of the innovative menu. I loved the vibrant decor and the atmosphere, just as much as I love all the other FRC places in the valley!

On the way to the PHX WM Open a few weeks ago, we found ourselves in a jam. We were late and our latest love of Uber was out of cars for the time being. Oops! Guess we should have thought of that! Enter UBERX. A little different in car styles than UBER, who generally uses 'higher end' vehicles to transport you; UBERX is still nice and still awesome, using a smaller SUV, for example. This way of going to events and saving on loads of parking fees, such as the case in SF, or where adult beverages may or may not be consumed, is the way to go. Download the UBER app on your smartphone and enter your information. It's a cashless, no tip, way of getting from point A event to point B or home, safely. The cars are always clean and the drivers are A+. All have background checks, btw. You are charged the fare estimate , that you see prior to ordering your car, upon arrival. They also rate you and vice versa. 5 stars every time. This has been a gods send this past holiday season. Cheaper than a DUI and no hassle.

Bitter & Twisted kind of reminds you of what you DO not want in your life! The twisted ex; the bitter ex-friend; maybe the twisted sister ; or maybe the bitter boss who makes YOU slowly become BITTER and then TWISTED by weeks end. Well, enter this amazing place to un-do all of the above.. I have been here twice now and it's a great addition to the downtown PHX scene! Housed on the street level floor of the Luhrs Building with a long architectural history dating back to the 1800's, Bitter & Twisted still seems to continue that 'Beaux Arts' theme in its decor; I love the big long drapes and the thick comfy couches.. the tall ceiling and dim lighting keep the theme alive. Happy Hour here is busy! Don't bring a giant group and expect to saunter in and belly up to the bar either ; Bitter doesn't work that way! Expect to wait with your group, be patient and you will eventually get one of those nice plush couches or a great table with a great team of wait staff. Tip: download the 'No Wait' app and get on the list prior to decrease your wait. The drinks on Happy Hour are awesome and they go until 7pm. Also another legit greatness about this place. There is the : Thrifty Cocktail, ( the mixology choice of the day); The Fresh Fruit Blend; $5 Prosecco , just to name a few of the HH highlights. On the last visit , I had a HH mojito with muddled fresh blackberries.. It came in a large pint glass! NOT a usual small 'happy hour, this is on special' glass. It was fresh, pretty, ( I like drinking pretty drinks ), and NOT too sweet , ( whereas I like pretty drinks, I don't care for overly sweet ones.. yeah. that.) The food menu is unique and perfect for this trendy, chic cocktail lounge. For example: The  MOMO Burger ! It's made out of crisped Ramen buns! ( Yes. I said 'ramen' , as in 'starving-in-college' ramen noodles).  Inside those buns of ramen is an ample soy marinated patty that's topped with carmelized onions, pepper jack cheese, jalapeño mayo and a little Siracha mixed with soba sauce. YUM! This burger has been much talked about in The Phoenix New Times ; The Thrillist ; AzCentral .. JUST to name a few! The rest of the menu is Asian inspired small plates but also Bitter & Twisted has a very amazing charcuterie plate that comes with a small ramekin of amazing pate and wonderful fresh bread! One of my favorite charcuterie plates in all of the valley. The drink menu is also unique and literally, A BOOK! This book describes all your latest or not so late things made into unique mixmaster cocktails that lead to what else .. being Twisted. BUT by now, it's in a good way:-) There are great beers, wines, bubbles and all the usual premium alcohols here for those that like it neat and not mixed. If the cocktail map leaves you confused , the bartenders are some of the best and they will help you out with your 'needs' ; complete talent! I can't rave enough about this great place that graces downtown Phoenix. Oh and they will validate for the parking garage on Madison/1st. Happy twisting!

This was a ton of fun! Awesome venue! Beautiful location and views; very clean! There could have been more port a pottys and some ran out of tissue. There was a ton of food and many options to delight any culinary palate. Lots of wine, beer and liquor set up in convenient places. We loved the music of Berlin and especially Huey Lewis. It was a beautiful, sunny AZ day topped with all the other things to make an event near perfect.

I love that there is some other coffee place now at Sky Harbor other than the usual Starbucks! Not only that, Press is imPRESSive! The staff is on their froth! They are all very inviting and friendly from the moment you step foot off the concourse carpet into the enclave of java/sandwich/salad/etyou are treated like a guest and not a number. I like that. They are seemingly thankful you are there to give them your time and money. I love that they recommend coffees or what not for you if you are sometimes indecisive like me. I sometimes want the Americano add shot and sometimes the American with two add shots! I mean I am a blonde and that is how it goes...hard to make those PRESSing decisions before I fly off to the friendly..skies! To go off the beans of normal try the macchiato, a little different than the one at the competitor. Good on the go grub for the flight too.

My first visit to Glo Med Spa last month was all I wished for when spending the money and time to revamp my skin. My career puts my skin thru the stresses and when I had begun to lose my glow and starting looking tired, NOT just feeling it, I started asking around to my friends who frequent med-spas in Scottsdale. Charles Small came highly recommended more than once !  My first visit I told him what I wanted my dull skin to look like and what my budget was. He took the time to explain what he could do and didn't attempt to push any more services or products on me. As a result, I left very happy with the results of a little Juvaderm around my eyes. I even had a Yelp check in offer for a B12 injection that month, which I asked him to explain, since I wasn't sure about it. He explained that if I am a regular vitamin taker, which I am, and I workout, which I do, then I may not notice much from the injection. I did get a little burst of energy, AND, to be honest , IF I was headed to Cabo or Vegas, I may load up on those.. To ward off any possible over indulgences!  Now that I am on the Glo Med Spa email, I am regularly receiving specials on skin treatments and that's a plus. My thought process is this: if Charles can help me and my skin not look so fatigued , I'm a fan! So far I will be back to keep my Glo:)

This place is hot! Hot in so many ways! The menu, the vibe, the people!  A group of 10 of us came here as a dinner club event that we had last week. It may go down as one of my new favorite places in the valley. The atmosphere is hip, trendy, and cool. Music pumps through a pretty awesome sound system and the food and drink menu are not the norm.  Cool orangey- Mayan- hot pink decor adorn the place. And the slider doors everywhere give the place an 'outside being in feel'. A tree in the center give that feel too!  I love a place like that!  This is not your parents Mexican, err, Asian eatery! In fact, my parents would either hate it or love it! But I was beyond impressed.  We all started at the very crowded Sumo Maya on a night that had a ton of Ferrari's in the parking lot. The valet guy said there was an event that night and the place was full! As was the valet; as was the parking lot!  My boyfriend loved the place for the 'eye candy' Ferrari's alone in the lot! Once I was able to pry his eyes back to me and into the restaurant,we bellied up to the bar to wait for the rest of our group and reservation time.   The drinks are like the menu: different. The drink menu is vast and there are lots of cool mixology drinks to choose from , or the usual beers, sakes and wines. I started with a "Coconut", made up of pearl coconut vodka, ginger-lemongrass, a little lime and coconut water. I admit, I don't like 'sweet' concoctions, so I was a little worried I was ordering out of my comfort zone. I was pleasantly surprised when the Coconut arrived in a cute, little champagne glass. I believe the coconut water and lime cut what would be sweet. I had two of these and don't let the small glass fool you: perfect and 'hidden' strong!  We were seated promptly at our reservation time. Despite how busy they were! There was not an open table or bar stool in the place. I am very glad we had a reservation! My boyfriend and I ordered the fresh made guacamole with lump crab as an appetizer. I love a great guacamole. This was off the charts, amaze-balls. Tons of fresh lump crab pieces adorned the top of this delectable bowl of perfect guac. It is served with flat tortillas that are 'street taco' size. We also ordered the Rollo Chingon sushi roll; I guess we could not decide on one thing we wanted to start with on this menu! Who doesn't love great sushi with a spin? The Rollo Chingon is a roll of grilled shrimp, fresh guacamole, a spice of jalepeno, housed on a sweet strawberry glaze and 'fried' red lotus root atop. Again, this 'starter' was an ample serving for two. I could have made dinner out of this one roll. But, I am a foodie and I like to sample many things!  For dinner I ordered the Chinese Chile Crab Garlic Noodles. This dish was ramen noodles with shiitake mushrooms and just enough green onions and a hint of miso to offset the flavors.To me, it had a 'pad thai' texture to it, which I loved.  Beware, this dish had a kick to it! The lump crab on top once again, happily surprised me. The concept of SumoMaya is 'small plates' , but honestly, I had enough of this dish for lunch the next day. Yes. It could have been that we could not decide and ordered a few things! My boyfriends entree was the Pork Belly Ramen. Rice sauteed with shiitake mushrooms, pea leaves, adorned with tender pork belly and adorned with a perfect poached egg and scallions. He had paired that with a Skinny Margarita, again strong!.. from the bar. Since we share most of our meals, I liked this dish, as well, BUT, I loved mine more! The dessert menu sounded awesome, but we passed on that. Too many meals out lately and too many dishes here at Sumo made us feel like fat kids, already!  I will admit I see where Sumo can work on a few things. For example, our dishes came out 'sporadically'. One couple in our group was getting their apps while some were on to their entrees. The water glasses ran empty a few times. This food has spice! Those glasses need to stay full! The parking lot was entirely full. The valet, too. First world problems of having to walk a block from parking up the way to Sumo. AND the restroom is tiny. That said. I loved this place and am already planning a Sunday Funday here with the advertised bottomless Bloody Mary's, Mimosas and Micheladas for $15 coupled with brunch and live music! Football is here and this would be a great place to have brunch and drinks on a Sunday. Welcome to the valley, Sumo! Despite the few little quirks, I can't wait to go back!

Nope. That's all I can rate this place. Nope. We arrived here the other night about 720p. The first thing... a drunken lady standing square in the middle of the entrance to The Vig and a wrapped bottle of unopened wine about to roll off the bench near the entrance. Okay. Odd. The hostess looked at my friend and I strangely for looking at this swaying lady who was not more than 8 feet from her!! No one here at The Vig wanted to help this lady? Grab that wine off the bench, maybe? That looked very, 'low rent'. SO.. in and around her we walked  into The Vig. The hostess barely greeted us, and I will admit we weren't in our normal 'dining out' attire, as we had just left a spinning class from across the way, so I guess I get that we looked maybe a little seedy in our running attire? This hostess never smiled and continued to seat us on the patio without saying a word. That's where we sat.. and waited.. and waited.. ANNNNNDDD.... waited for almost 20 minutes before we finally got the bus boy, who was now to filling our waters a second time, and we asked him for a waiter. The waiter FINALLY arrived and just said, "You guys know what you want..or you still checking it out?" There was no apology for the wait or no drink order taken. Nope. Nada. He could have cared less. Was The Vig busy this night? No. NOW.. HAD we not been SO hungry/hangry from our hard workouts, I would have called it right then and there... and left. I have this thing about working hard for my money that I am about to spend on a meal out and I just kind of want a little bit of decent service to go with it. Clearly The Vig McCormick was just gonna fail BIG on that tonight. Not wanting this waiter to leave us again, we ordered diet sodas, lemons for the waters we had filled 3 or 4x now, (those never did arrive), and our entrees. My friends mac and cheese was less than awesome. The cheese was just pasty, for a lack of better descriptives and tasteless. It was an ample bowl and she wanted it to be great! After all.. WE had just burned tons of calories and wanted to eat! She didn't finish even half. I ordered the fish tacos, which I have had several times at The Vig. They were okay. Nothing monumental and nothing horrible. If anything, they could have been warmer. One was ice cold on the fish and I just didn't trust eating it. I did not finish mine either. It's not as though our waiter asked us if all was okay. He didn't. Our diet sodas went empty and we finally just asked the bus girl, (or she could have been another waitress), for the bill, as our waiter just wasn't showing up. We got a container for that less than mac and cheese and he saw we had a promo from the cycling place we had just been to.. NOW suddenly he wanted to chat! How transparent. So I decided at that point.. I won't be showing up here anymore either. The end. What a huge disappointment.

I love small town, friendly, good eateries like this! Smoke Dem Bones BBQ is near my fiancées office , so we popped in one day for an early dinner , late lunch kind of thing. You order from the counter in the small , casual establishment and the food is brought to you rather promptly after. I had the brisket and pulled pork with cole slaw. My fiancée had the brisket and hot ( sausage) links and macaroni and cheese. He is originally from North Carolina and knows his BBQ , and 'southern sides'. I just like good food! I was impressed with the briskets flavor and juiciness, because that's not always the case with a cut of meat, like brisket. The slaw is different with every barbeque place, it seems, but I really liked this one. The macaroni and cheese was homemade and creamy delicious. We liked the entire meal so much we got a three meat meal to go for dinner the next night! It's topped with the fact that it's super friendly and family run and they seem eager to please you with a great BBQ meal.

We decided to do something different this year for New Years Eve; Teppanyaki was the choice! Rock Lobster has two teppanyaki tables so reservations are a must. There were three of us for the 5pm seating on NYE and we were warmly greeted and seated promptly. The Power Hour is a complete bargain! EVERYTHING pretty much outside of lobster dishes on the teppanyaki entree menu is half off! The menu is very expansive with the usual steaks, shrimp, chicken type of dishes, combos but also calamari steaks and seabass too. We opted for the Date Night menu, which on NYE was a Champagne Boule for each (adult), a sushi roll of our choosing, NOT the restaurants!; and a choice of two NY Strip, Chicken, Calamari or Shrimp entrees. All served with rice, (fried or steamed), soup, salad and a app of edamame. Generally if the champagne isn't served, as in this evening, its a sake bomber. Date Night for 2/ $49.95. On the Power Hour we added a Filet/Shrimp Combo, that also came with soup, salad and fried rice. Dinner for 3 with drinks, wine and tea.. $89! We brought much of one dinner home for the next day. The happy hour is expansive. The staff is informative, patient, (as many at our teppanyaki table had LOTS of questions and repeat questions!), fun and the chef is engaging and a wicked great chef! Everything that we ordered was good, fresh and served hot and according to order. THE only one part that keeps this from a 5star review, the door. We were freezing! We asked twice for the door to be closed because we all put our wool coats on at the teppanyaki table which is warm from all the cooking! It just kept getting opened by the staff and patrons. Not a huge deal because everything else was spot on. Can't wait to go back and have more sushi! Rock Lobster is in a very pristine little upscale enclave bordering the Ocotillo area next door to the Living Room wine bar.. if your not from the Chandler area, take an Uber and make this your night out area!

Diagnosis: One flight attendant hurt in a storm; Then comes all the rest : High doses of medications ; steroids; surgery; couch; television.. NO activity... You get the picture.  No running. No crossfit. No P90x. Nada. Nothing. Zilch.  Several months later: One flight attendant with a fat a*&; a fat face; out of shape; borderline high blood pressure.   Enter: Orangetheory Fitness.  After much research, I ended up at Orangetheory Fitness. Prior to my one un-lucky day in a winter storm , I was an avid runner. I did P90X; plyos; whatever was hard. I loved it. Great legs came with pain, in my opinion. When it all came to a screeching halt, and all that followed was a mess of steroids and meds that added pounds, depression, and a life I didn't know. I literally did not know what to do with weight that kept on creeping on and a doctor that was telling me I could none of the workouts I was used to. I figured my fate now was in my hands. Added weight on a petite body is never good.I am a little over 5 feet something! I have never not worked out and the past year plus has killed me! From my looks, (I am super vain, I will admit!) , to not having the clarity in mind that a great workout gives. This was affecting me body , mind and soul. This week, I took my terrified self to OTF. I had called before to make an appointment, (very necessary), and was advised to bring a towel, water and arrive 30 minutes prior to the workout at said time. I walked in terrified.I wondered if I was gonna feel like a chubby girl in a gym full of pretty people! IF SO.. I was gonna run out and head for Krispy Kreme! (Okay .. not really)..  I have NEVER been a fan of gyms. I have always liked trail running, or anything outside. That is the beach girl in me.The beach is where I started running, after all! But since moving to Phoenix, I have been forced to jump on treadmills in gyms and had been a member at gyms in the valley and always just felt blah about the entire thing. Enter the staff at OTF. I was greeted warmly, immediately. After filling out my paperwork and such, I was fitted with a pod to rate my heart rate, etc. All that was about to take place was explained in great detail. Next I met Emily. She was awesome from GO. Emily walked me through the actual training area of Orangetheory. I have never been on a rowing machine, for example, so she placed me on one and showed me how its done. She explained the screens to which the pod was gonna register my heart and workout pace/zone. Luckily, I was in a class with one group, so she stated it would be easier for her to monitor me. We started our cardio portion on the treadmill. Base. Push. All Out. You will have to go to understand what this means. Not once did I feel alone or stupid. I will tell you, this workout was not for a pansy. It's almost for the sadomasochist who likes to be yelled at and told what to do and being pushed beyond the limits! I totally need that .. I need my a*& kicked! There were all shapes and sizes in this facility. You are so focused on your workout and your progress and zone on the screen above, you don't have time to care about the person next to you, UNLIKE other gyms. I loved that Emily was walking around the entire time, coaching, telling you to go to BASE. To PUSH. To go ALL OUT. Where to pump your treadmill up to for the power walkers or for the runners. How much time was left on each. It's a serious freaking workout! I would say as advice that if you have not worked out a DAY in your life, you may want to be warned! You will sweat and you may even want to throw up, but you will get through it and when you do..You will know you did it for you; your body and your health. The time flies by on the treadmill and then you go to the rower. This was my 'weak' point; I admit the thing felt awkward to me, but I did it and it was hard. I was dead last in finishing! So what. This is my workout.Next we moved to pull downs, the Bosu ball for crunches, reps of weights and this goes for the last part of class. You can totally walk out of class..to the loo, at any time,  as I did,(to toss my cookies in my mouth a little! JK!) , for a second.  I have never left a place like this feeling accomplished; okay.. I've never been to a place like this where I felt like I was getting personal training in a group! I  signed up with the intent of pushing myself to be here in class to get my a*& twice a week. The memberships are monthly with a thirty day cancel window. The awesome thing for me and my career, I can use my membership in other cities. Theres an app for booking classes. The verdict on my success to be continued. The endorphin rush I had all day: Very Major.Here's to getting me back!

IT has not been quite a month since I began my mission with OTF and I said in my previous review that I would update my progress along the way, as it's easy to be excited about what's new in the beginning and just like anything that 'new' can fade .. ( Like a new boyfriend ?? A new handbag?? Do you follow me?!!) Well, my love of the Orange factor has not faded one bit. I have a serious Orange crush! You know how you get that pit in your tummy feeling when you first are giddy over something? Yeah. I get that when I'm driving to OTF. It's more of a , 'This is going to KICK my A&$ and I may toss my cookies , ( Oh GOD! Please don't let THAT happen !!) ... let me get thru this! How or what is this instructor gonna do to us today? !' feeling. But I love it. It's a good nervous that takes you out of your couch potato comfort zone...& it should ! No one achieves by sitting on the duff! Everyone at this OTF location is so welcoming and helpful, as I had some snafus at first with my app and booking my classes; or my device came unsnapped and stopped logging my 'splats' during the session...( just needed a new charged one!) The instructors all pump you up; modify for injury or pain; and guide you thru what is awkward : TRX.. that is an awkward device for me! Go and you will know! In this less than a month , I am down almost 7 pounds and 1.5 inches where it counts. That may not seem like much.. but I am petite and it takes small miracles of above to fight against loads of meds that have been pumped into this small frame that have caused this disaster! I feel way more energetic and to me... it's worth every bit the $$. The trade off of what I spend on less things that do not a thing for my health and livelihood. I can sprint ( ALL OUT!) now like I used to and look forward to flying in those new uniforms with a smaller size attached soon!

The Brown Bag is a cool little bag of a find in North Phoenix. My husband works in the area and always wants quick and 'go' foods when we meet up for lunches. Lately, I am into healthier stuff and so when he suggested The Brown Bag, I immediately pulled it up on Yelp to be sure there was more than just carb heavy sandwiches. To my surprise, there was! The Brown Bag is tucked away in a strip mall but don't let that sway you away, things here are tasty. The deco inside is modern and cool. You order at the counter of what could be described as a little like a coffee shop. I ordered the salad that was a special that day called The Siam Salad. The order was delivered to the patio outside, which is lovely in the shade, by the way, within about 5 minutes. Snappy service for someone who only has a bit of time for lunch! My salad was big and good! Lots of freshly roasted chicken breast, sliced red peppers, shredded carrots, cilantro, and a few green onions all on top of LOTS of shredded healthy cabbage! This salad does come with almonds, but I can't.. so they were held. The sweet chile vinaigrette placed on the side added pizazz to this already flavor bursting salad. This was the perfect lunch for this spring day after an intense workout. They also serve coffees with a nice espresso/capp machine to do so with. The teas looked also refreshing! Now I know not all 'brown bag's' are created equal with loads of sandwiches and carbs.. and where as they do offer great looking hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches and wraps, its nice to know there is a healthy item or two or three to wrap your lips and hips around too!

'Sorso'... To Sip.  This may be the first wine bar that I have ever been to like this where you can do what it's name says...'sorso' or sip first before you buy your glass or your bottle. Ex professional baseball player, Mark Teahen and his wife Lauren took the concept of the 'enomatic' wine dispensing system that they found while visiting Chianti, Italy and brought it to their wine bar here in Scottsdale. A bottle of wine is attached to a tap dispensing system and delivers the same quality as a newly opened bottle for up to four weeks. The beauty of that is that you can try an otherwise pretty pricy sip or taste of wine that would normally be ONLY found in most places by the bottle. Here you can sample it and then decide to splurge on that $200 bottle or not. Maybe it wasn't as good as you thought it would be! There are 32 wines on the interactive dispensing system from all over the world here at Sorso. Upon being seated,  you are 'assigned' a card for your dispensing needs and wishes at the taps with your credit card. Our waitress was Whitney and she was very good at explaining the card, the dispensing system and the iPad that is left at the table. She was a great server overall, considering she had her hands full that night! The iPad is cool too, as it allows you to go through the wines to see if you would rather just have a glass or bottle. Like an iPad wine list at the tip of your fingers! The concept of Sorso is ALL Italy, of course. The menu for food is Italian in nature. Prosciutto; Cappicolla; Salami; Gelato.. you get my point.  We ordered a bruschetta board of four. My friends were comparing the bruschetta to Postino and didn't like it. I loved the bread but could have done with out the salami and prosciutto on the bruschetta being cooked. I ordered a TAPP salad and craved it the next day; IT was that good! The portion size was huge! The TAPP is a combination of fresh shaved turkey breast, avocado and pesto; the dressing is a light olive oil citrusy mix. I always get my dressings on the side so it doesn't overwhelm the taste of the fresh salad. LOVED it. Our beginning wines were amazing. The card concept is perfect and a way to keep track of who is getting/dispensing what for the final bill, so as long as you don't mix up your card with your friends! My friend got a Bubble Flight; I haven't seen a sampling of bubbly anywhere else and what a neat way to sample four VERY generous, different pours of bubbly! Speaking of bubbly, there is even a neat Bubble Float: Prosecco served over Gelato!! It makes me all bubbly inside just thinking of when I can go back to Sorso and taste this delight!  Sorso is a great place for a date night. There are several beers either by the bottle or on tap, if your not into wines. There are also dessert wines to go with what else?! Italian style desserts. Charcuterie boards;  Cheese boards; Salads; Bruschettas with amazing bread. The patio is a good people watching spot with intimate tables and there are longer community tables too if you are out with a group of people and not on a date night. Sorso also has a yummy looking brunch menu with Italian coffees on the menu. I'm a yes to the returnabilty factor! On our way out we grabbed a good Italian wine to take home from the market that has take home wines and beer and other various cute Italian things. I can't wait to go back to sip..taste.. pour and savor! I love Italy so I am glad to see a true real Italian wine bar here in the area!!

I adore buying these cute little bundles of bundts for little somethings for the specials in my life. They are always fresh and always unique. Cute and seemingly flavorful. I recently was told , "NO gluten"...that is tough! SO I do my best. SO I use the excuse to buy a bundt for someone else. The staff here is always adorned in cuteness of apron! Willing to let you taste.... they have a flavor of the day and the shop is too adorable. They will box the cake up and adorn it all adorable with a flower. Too cute! I am over cute'ing this review... but you get it by now!

IF you snooze thru brekky , well there's always Snooze for brunch-y. I can't hit my snooze button on the weekends because I am excited for my Snooze experience ! Mimosas in many fresh squeezed fruity flavors for $6 ... yes, please! I'll have two! This particular Saturday with my friends, I was in the mood to try the fresh squeezed grapefruit Mimosa ... just enough tart to level out the sweet sparkling wine. Angelo was our waiter and we got the patio, luckily, to enjoy the beautiful Arizona spring like weather. We all shared a splurgey sweet, very dessert like pancake called the Pineapple Upside Down Cake... heaven upside down in my mouth is what this delight was! So sweet , with chunks of pineapple and sweet glaze on top ... no way could I have  eaten this as an entire meal.. OKAY, I could have, BUT I stopped myself from that sweetness overload. I went with the protein filled Huevos Rancheros, a favorite of mine with poached over easy eggs, perfectly placed over black beans and then over steamed, (not fried), tortillas; this recipe comes with three eggs to fill you up..some other places only give you two. I also substituted the usual sauce for the Ranchero Sauce, as I tend to like my sauces a little more on the green side. So good and filling! The pico de gallo is nice to top it all off. I am dying to try the Benny Duo one of these brunch filled days... Snooze is one of the only places I have been to that allows you to have a half order of one of their great unique , (or traditional), eggs benedicts and another half order of another when you want to try two of them! Sometimes its just so hard to decide on just one! Another thing to splurge and split , (or not!), is the OMG French Toast. This will knock your entire socks off.. or your workout clothes..or your pjs if you are still wearing them when you arrived at Snooze. I split this one day with my hubby and it reminded me of the stuffed french toast you can find down in New Orleans. Snooze takes thick, fat brioche bread and french toasts it all up; stuffs it with sweetened mascarpone cheese; tops this now amazing stuffed french toast with vanilla cream and caramel and THEN tops it off with fresh plump strawberries and toasted coconut... YES. YOU will say, " OH EM GEE'. And then your eyes may pop out of your head because its so delish and heavenly.  If all this is too much of a carb overload like it is for me, get one of their coffees. They make their java good and strong.  Yes. Snooze has a wait. Every time I have been, I have waited at minimum thirty plus minutes. So what. Get on the list and go walk about Kierland and grab your coffee and stroll. Wouldn't you be doing that anyway? Stop complaining about the small things and enjoy your brunch once you have worked for it after you walked it off. Oh and bring the pooch. The patio is pup friendly. :-)

LGO! YOU never disappoint ! Oh how I wish I stilled lived next to all things LGO. But oh well. Days like this, we were in my old neighborhood and I pulled my handy-dandy bookmarks up and voila! Buck & Rider appears! Buck & Rider has a crazy definition to it in the ocean world of crustaceans. I am not sure that this is the place to explain said definition. But the name is catchy! Buck & Rider brings LGO to the next level of swank. A little fancier than Chelsea's Kitchen and putting the spin on fresh seafood in the beauty of Arcadia. The inspiration for the cute building the restaurant is housed in is from a beach house from a swanky beach town in Australia. Walking through the restaurant to the patio, the raw bar is centrally located and for being lunch on a Wednesday, Buck & Rider was busy! Yay for complimentary valet! For being a relatively new restaurant, you can't tell. Our everything was on point! We were seated on the patio on a great spring Arizona day. The patio is prime spot for a view of Camelback Mountain across Camelback Road. You do not get the perfect view of the mountain, as there is traffic from the street, but you do still have a great view from the patio. I can see this being where the Biltmore/Arcadia pretty people go in the evenings ! Our cordial waitress explained everything from the All Day Happy Hour till 700pm!!! $6 cocktails!  (Oh how I wish.. but it was only lunch time and we had to be responsible) to Abby's Oyster Bar offerings. Lots of half priced oysters and raw bar items to choose from! Buck & Rider makes sure to notate on their menu that the seafood is fresh and flown in daily. I can not tell you how many times I have put my nose in the air about seafood that claims to be 'fresh' for the mere fact that we are in the desert and I just don't believe the 'fresh' claim. This was fresh. Very fresh. We started with the Crab & Macadamia Roll; a perfect bit of crunch from the macadamia nuts housed in this crab roll with asparagus and the perfect amount of shiso remoulade make it nice, fresh and just a little kick. It was nice to get a sushi roll that you don't see everywhere else as a starter. For my lunch entree, I ordered the Thai Style King Crab Salad. This salad comes with a generous portion of FRESH crab! There is also avocado, yummy mango, cilantro, over thinly cut lettuce. The vinaigrette is also a cilantro and I had that served on the side; it gives the salad a kick! You honestly could eat this salad with no dressing at all and it would taste very good. I had the nuts held and I added on a couple of grilled shrimp at $3 a pop. It was worth every.single.bite. This salad was fresh, healthy and filling! There is an amazing looking Lemon Meringue Pie on the menu and from the pics from my fellow Yelpers, I have to come back and try it. Today was not the day, so says my OTF trainer! This is a welcome addition for seafood and swank in the neighborhood! I can't wait to come back to Buck and Ride...er oh wait. No. Come back to Buck & Rider. Yes. That's it. Thanks LGO again for amazing-ness!

I truly wanted to love this place after all the 5-star reviews on Yelp. One day when we had a hankering for fatty, greasy, football type of food, rather than order from our usual wings place , we opted to try the chicken here. Wings and chicken strips done , 'Louisiana' style ? We thought, 'Why not?' We ordered the wings which were actually good and big! Very saucy , but definitely not the usual, 'buffalo style' one may be used to. My chicken strips, were again, HUGE! Here's the reason I'm giving a two star. These chicken strips tasted as though old oil was used for the frying prep of their cooking. You know that, 'old, sitting around, rancid, been used and fried too many things too many times in this oil', taste ?? That is all I could taste. I did eat a couple of them after I , 'Louisiana'd' them up with my own New Orleans spices. But I ended up tossing the rest. The idea is awesome because there are also donuts here too! Drive thru is a little less than efficient , but I'm assuming that's because everything is made-to-order and that's okay. But that oil taste and the fact that my chicken that I wanted to splurge on so bad ... just missed the mark on taste. Wings -6 out of 10 Chicken Strips 0-10

This place reminds me of pubs in the UK. Quaint, colorful and inviting from the street. I loved the red shutters with bar stools that open out to the street. The iron gate outside is also a pub-by little touch. Inside, wood floors and a simple, yet good menu for noshing whilst enjoying good craft brews both on tap and in ye bottle. Guinness and Magners on tap too.. ( I'm a girl and I think that's special ). Happy hour is 3pm to 6pm but also comes later from what our waitress mentioned. There are also several, well priced  wines on the menu too. Cocktails are there, but there wasn't a cocktail menu to go from.. and that is okay.. I like that they keep it simple. My hubby and shared the mussels that are fresh, steamed and bathed in yummy, garlicky, wine sauce that comes with Irish brown bread for soaking that yummy goodness up with. The Reuben is authentic and good! A pub should always have a Reuben! This sandwich was thick with fresh cooked corned beef, just enough saurkraut, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing all on marbeled rye bread. This was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.. sometimes a Reuben can be salty, because corned beef is so salty.. it just is! This wasn't ! Now this was my hubby's sammy, so I could only snag a bite or two.. but I had a bit of order envy! I had the Blackened Chicken Sandwich, which was also very good. A good portioned chicken breast filet, blackened, topped with peppered crisp bacon, Swiss cheese, an avocado and a really good limey, peppery mayonnaise on a ciabatta bread. I had a side salad with my sandwich and my husband got the fries. Speaking of fries... LOTS of fry variety on the menu for drink noshing! Truffled fries; Garlic and Rosemary fries; Curry fries.. BUT also, more extreme fries like : Buffalo Fries that come with shredded chicken , blue cheese crumbles and dressing ! Totally reminds me of a night out of pub crawling in Ireland.. they love some fries over there when the drunchies hit:-) I was looking forward to more 'Pub' fare and had perused the menu prior to our stop into Kettle Black. I didn't see the , ' Across the Pond' part of the menu that has all day Irish breakfast and Veggie Pasty and my fav from the Irish lads: Shepherds Pie. They did have Corned Beef and Cabbage on the menu and the Fish and Chips.. so hopefully when we get back, this part of the menu is back too, as a real pub , should have some real pub food! That said.. I like this place.. A lot! The owner strolls around and says hi to everyone and the bathrooms are clean. I love that this is a new great place in downtown that isn't clubby and has more of a trendy, quaint feel. I would love to eventually see live music come in for a night or two ! Cant wait to go back!

The Proper Beast may just be my new favorite thing in Phoenix... proper. To me behind every great review is a great story that lies behind a great local business. This is it. Recently I happened up the beast in all of his glory at the Phoenix Public Market on a chilly fall Saturday morning. What caught my eye was the adorable signage, to be honest, as I scoured all the local delights with my piping hot coffee in hand. Its a pig dressed up in a top hat and bow tie! My husband was lured in by the samples of warm bratwursts and beer dip. We ended up buying a couple of the dips that day: the Beer dip and the Chorizo dip for a football Sunday outing we were attending; testing the Italian Heat Ciabatta Bread that was used for a stuffing sample that day, and I was blown away by the taste and regretted not buying some that day. As I LOVE a great homemade bread! This ciabatta is not too hot in taste, but it does have just enough of an intriguing kick to it; It's a sourdough bread thats infused with The Proper Beasts Italian Heat Sausage and parmesan cheese. My husband had to get a warm pretzel to walk around the market with. We vowed to be back. Everyone who tasted the dips was blown away and asked where we got them from. The cheesy goodness with bites of sausage is too good to pass up! A few weeks later we went back for more of the dips as now we were having guests in town for the holiday celebrations. I got to speak with the owner more that day and in talking he spoke of how he makes a Italian Heat Bread Pudding from his Italian Heat Ciabatta! Sold. I was buying that bread. He said he would get it to me closer to the holiday and even email me his recipe, which he did. The day before Christmas Eve he met up with my husband and brought the loaves of bread we needed, and more dip!  The sausages that he makes are locally produced by him with no fillers, no weird antibiotics, MSG, and all natural casings. The Blinks, a breakfast type sausage is made with a apple rum sauce, but has no added sugar; Knock your socks off amazing! I have been so impressed with everything that we have purchased from The Proper Beast and his follow- through customer service and the all natural ingredients in his foods, that I did a little homework on Brian Hines, the owner of this great local find.   Brian was in the corporate world and found himself laid off. He enjoyed cooking and decided on doing what had not been done yet in the Phoenix area. Enter The Proper Beast. Brian got started at the grassroots level and by taking his meats that are made with local Arizona products like Kilt Lifter Ale in his brats or Arizona Angel wine in the Italian Sausage,  to local markets such as the Phoenix Public Market, Scottsdale Old Town Market, Ahwatukee Farmers, Queen Creek  and the Gilbert Farmers Market. My tip to you: Get to a local market near you and sample some of this goodness.. or at least check out the proper, well suited pig in a suit!

I write one star reviews very rarely. This one has to be written. This has to be THE worst dining experience I've had in many years. This place has SO much potential. It's on a beautiful lake, for goodness sakes! Dillon's has moved over from Scorpion Bay to this location and so much can be SO amazing here. Summer isn't even here quite yet and I can tell you that they missed the mark the other night from every angle that they possibly could when we decided to dine here. I felt like kids were running this place! It was like NO one cared and how fast can closing come so we can get out of here! On this day we were visiting  our friends who dock their boat here , we walked over about 515pm for dinner and wine on this particular beautiful evening. The outside seating was full, ( not that we were asked if we wanted to wait) , so we were seated inside and were not addressed by our waitress for several minutes. She did arrive and apologized that there were only two of them that evening to , 'bear with them'. We noticed that there seemed to be two girls and about six guys ? doing something? And just one bartender. We finally ordered several minutes later: a Reisling; a starter of Fried Pickles; an order of Chicken Tenders ( Fries and Cole Slaw side) ; a Pulled Pork Sandwich with BBQ Beans and my BBQ Turkey with a Salad and Mac/Cheese for the side. Reisling comes in a plastic glass that looks like a cheap wedding reception from the 1970's! It's pretty funny, actually! But the problems began when our meals arrived before the starter. Who doesn't dislike that? As the guy goes to place my meal... he knocks over an entire full ice water ALL over me, my phone, into my brand new Kate Spade bag! We grab the bag and the iPhone .. The expensive things! I can dry eventually! The poor guy is embarrassed and just kind of stands there; The waitress is what makes it bad. 'Are you okay? Your not really all that wet, are you ? Your phone... I mean, it's turning on now, isn't it?' We suggested we move. Not her. She just acted like she didn't care a bit! Meanwhile our food was placed and had now gotten cold during this water fiasco. And yes. I was soaked from my left legs to my booty...to my right leg! I was wearing running pants and it has that material in black that whisks away moisture. On to the meal. Horrible. My turkey was dry & ice cold on the slices on the ends. It was so dry it was almost not chewable ! As if it had been heated in a microwave. All of the meals were now cooled in the fiasco that she didn't care to even attempt to fix , reheat? OR re do!! Some kid comes over now, 'Are you okay'? I was. Another one. Who I swear.. seemed high, as he had to ask and re ask the same thing because he was not understandable. NO. The wine had tipped and now had less than a sip in it, someone at the table joked! He didn't get it. ( That was a hint: Replace the wine the employee tipped over ??!) We had not got our starter YET or my salad OR one of the other sides! The waitress brings the cold Fried Pickles and goes on and on about how the kitchen is 'really messing those tickets up lately' ... Then says ' You know that was not his fault ( the water incident); I've done that a 100 times and it happens!' OF course I know it's not his fault!!!! What is the fault now is you acting like this is not any big deal to me... our meal...& me sitting here wet. I get that accidents happen.. it's the follow up that makes or breaks the situation. The bill comes and I am now a little beyond upset & I said , 'Okay my dinner needs to come off this bill... right.now.' Because we had been charged full for every thing that was wrong with this meal. How appalling is that?? She was genuinely confused. A bit goes by. I see rolling eyes from her and whispers with her and her co workers as they roll silver for the next day's opening , ( the restaurant is now closed). She took the meal off and comp'd us a cheesecake. NOT one person seeming like a manager came over; Not once did this waitress seem to care.. our meal was screwed up even without the water all over me! Learn how to take care of customers and get it together. This place has THE absolute best position for business on the lake! GO with that and make it wonderful! This was anything but... I rode back to PHX wet.. and placed my iPhone in rice :) Thanks for the stressful meal on the beautiful lake! Jeesh!

Giving ANY Postino a two star pains me...but my experience here last weekend, is exactly what happened to me: Pain. I have waited for SO long for Postino to come to Kierland and this location is superb! My bestie and I had opted out of a LBD night and just went on an impromptu hike and didn't want to completely miss out on Postino goodness... We are frequents to Postino Arcadia, IN FACT, its one of my favorite, GO TO and one of the places I recommend to anyone that asks me for a great date place or where to grab the best bruschetta and wine! With that, we braved Postino on a Saturday evening as the desert sun was setting in all of our sweaty goodness, blonde hair up and sunglasses on and just decided to dodge into this new Postino and grab quick bruschetta take out, a maybe a quick glass of wine while we waited and dodge out before anyone may judge us on our less than attractiveness and we caused too much a stir or took too much space up. Already about 600pm on this particular Saturday evening, this new Postino was packed with Scottsdales usual bevy of beautiful people! The atmosphere was lively and upbeat! I particularly loved the open-ness of this new location! The bar opens out to a patio that is larger than any of the other Postino locations and looks out into Kierland Commons for good people watching. Now I had wished we had taken the time, post hike and gone back home and showered and pulled our blonde selves together for a Postinos night out because the vibe was fun, trendy and as Postino's always is: On point. Nonetheless, we were shuffled to the bar by the hostess to place our to-go order with the bartender; She was not overly friendly, but I understand this location has just newly opened and they were also quite slammed; literally there was not one seat open inside or out at the bar. My bestie and I are literally about 5'1 and 5'2 inches tall and weigh NOT much and we asked one server who seemed pretty annoyed with us standing at the bar waiting, where we should stand..he pointed to us to go stand by the door and said, "Well, your kind of in the way here". We apologized to him, but honestly did not know where to go! There was no space at the bar, no space at any of the 'high tops', no space by the door. We just stood behind each other and opted to not have that glass of wine we had wanted to have while awaiting our take out order.  About twenty minutes later we noticed two  take out bags come out to the bar, a girl from behind the bar asked the bartender who took our order something about the bags and they were suddenly moved over to the side. We figured between the server and the bartender, they wanted us out of their way as soon as possible, so the brown take out bags couldn't be ours! We waited a few more minutes and saw another brown bag come out and the same scenario take place.. ten more minutes go by and the server continued to become more annoyed with our standing beside where he was coming and going from the bar. Finally, we asked about the bag and take out. A female server asked our name and low and behold grabs the first bag that had been sitting there for almost thirty minutes! NO apology. Feeling in the way and sorry we ever had this idea in the first place, we left with our take out. Note to self, call ahead for take out and send one person in and ask the hostess to retrieve it. We get home now with our own wine get our lovely Postino bruschetta out and the Sunshine Dream Salad,  which is one of my very favorite salads. Ta Dah! A few bites in to the salad, however, I knew something was very wrong. I am allergic to several nuts. NOT the cashews that are usually in this salad, but almost every other kind of nut. My mouth was swelling, my face was turning red and I know the signs of what was about to happen. Clearly a nut besides cashew was substituted in my salad; This just became my Saturday night: dealing with heading off a food allergy before I ended up in the hospital. I LOVE Postino! I have had ROTD more than a couple of times in the past few years for how much I love them! As someone with food allergies, I scan a menu back and forth to make sure to take the responsibility of NOT ordering anything remotely near what can make me sick. IF there is a doubt, I discuss with the server. IT's a complete pain to do that at times! I think this Postino location is still great and I think GREAT potential is there once they get though working the kinks out. The other locations are awesome and with this Kierland location and how trendy, the great indoor/outdoor bar and patio area and size of this location, there is NO way it won't be amazing! A little work on customer service is in order and watching food cross contamination or substitution of ingredient ? or order mix ups? if that is what happened in my case with this salad is hugely important! Will I be back? Absolutely! I hope the kinks get worked out fast,as the vibe and menu have made me love Upward Projects and other Postinos locations.

Southern Rail.. how can you go wrong with a name like that? It's southern and its near the rail line! Southern Rail is housed in The Newton Building. A building of common commercial buildings holding true to its roots from its name sake: Jay Newton. Newton was the founder of the iconic Beef Eaters that used to be here and now houses Southern Rail. BUT within The Newton building is a coffee shop and a bookstore too. Chef Justin Beckett has achieved greatness with Becketts Table and now Southern Rail. The menu takes good American classics and 'souths' them up! I'd like to think Chef Beckett just brought the dirty south to the valley of the sun! This place is vibrant and has a cool patio with a great decor and lively music piping through the speakers that take you back in time. Listening to southern Lynyrd Skynard while one drinks on trendy sips is pretty legit, dontchathink?! We opted for a table outside on the patio. IN the fall this will be a great place to come and hang as the fireplace is in the center and adds to the 'look'. There is a cool sound to the light rail and that just adds to the atmosphere when it passes by. We came here during Restaurant Week and for my birthday dinner. I immediately loved the drink menu names: This Dog Won't Hunt! or how about the Hush Puppy Hush! Ha! A little strong for this weak wine sipping Californian, so I got the Kings Rex to start with: Champagne; honey; fresh squeezed lemon and brandy. It sounds strong, but it didn't feel it! It had the lemony taste of a French 75 that you see in New Orleans. Even if I didn't like the dinner I was about to order, I decided I would come back to Southern Rail for the Social Hour that runs from 3-6pm and have that drink again. There are also local beers on draft from 4Peaks and Mother Rode and a smattering of good wines too.  Birthday dinner time! I opted for the Restaurant Week price fixe menu/ $33. I got the Chicken Skin and Hot Sauce Deviled Eggs that were the good old fashioned southern type with a little hot sauce drizzled on top; 3 eggs in a serving and they were so finger licking good!  Next course I chose the BLT Salad. I expected this to be a small portion, as you sometimes find that with price fixe menus; THIS was not. Lots of thick cut smoky bacon, fresh tomato, grilled green onions, all atop ALOT of lettuce and drizzled with a combination of a cola bbq and a thousand island spicy type of dressing. I could have made this my meal! For my RW entree, I chose the Shrimp and Grits. I do love me some old fashioned southern shrimp and grits when I am in the south and these did not disappoint. The grits were rich, creamy and topped with several bbq shrimp and sauce to round out the richness. MMMMM MMMMM good! (In my best southern voice!). This RW meal also came with a glass of either a white or red wine or a draft beer. I got the red wine, a San Reckoner 'r' Red Blend and it was very good! The dessert menu was as tempting as a cool brook on a hot southern day, but I didn't have room in my full tummy! They have southern favorites like Banana Pudding made with wafers or Bread Pudding made with Pecans! Our service was very good; our water never went dry, even though there is a carafe of water you can fill on your own leisure placed at your table, our attentive waitress never let that happen. Our apps came when they should have and not before the entree or while we were still enjoying them. Thats important! Bourbon and BBQ night is on Monday and Tuesday and we inquired about that: $20 for a platter of BBQ , ( the selections seem to change), two bourbons OR a bottle of wine! WHERE can one find that kind of deal at a great up and coming trendy restaurant ??? I can't wait to come back and get me some more ! I do declare Southern Rail.. You have stolen my heart!

Finally , FINALLY!!! An absolute good , no... actually , a GREAT nail salon in S. Phoenix! Let me attest to this: I've tried almost all that exist since moving in with my used to be boyfriend and now my husband in this area of town. Moving from Biltmore has been painful in so many ways! The nail salon scene is just one!! I saw AZ Nails and decided to give them a try ... rather than make the trek to my usual place that's 25 minutes away. I made sure I had my nails done here a couple of times prior to doing a review to be sure I didn't jinx my first timers luck. I've now had manicures and pedicures here and both times : phenomenal! My gel mani lasted more than two weeks and I only went in again because I'm off to Mexico and wanted a fresh gel manicure for my trip, not because my nails were chipping or looking bad. AZ Nails is clean, nicely decorated, has friendly people that talk to you ! Their prices are good and they have a price list that you can see , because sometimes places don't. I really do not care for that guessing game as you are going along in your mani experience. AZ Nails has a huge selection of OPI, Shellac and Gelish gel swatches ... I always want the newest colors , ( that I find on Pinterest!! Yes. I just wrote that) , and trends in my mani or pedi and its here! The first pedi I had here was the ultimate ! I ended up with the works for about $30 and the guy threw in a great massage for my shoulders too... maybe that was extra? I don't know ... but I loved it! I would recommend calling ahead for evening appointments and weekends... I usually go in the late mornings , grab a Starbucks that's right next door and have not had to wait very long... but I do know that their appointment book is packed. They also do waxing!
