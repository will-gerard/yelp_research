My wife and I came here for Valentine's dinner with a reservation made through opentable.com, we were very excited as this was going to be our first night out since having our little boy in late December. We used to work at this place back when it was Lantana Grill almost 8yrs ago, in fact this is where we met each other. She was a server and I was in room service for the resort, both share the same kitchen. So this night out meant a lot to us in many ways.   When we arrived to our surprise the reservation was worth nothing because they weren't even open for dinner at the time opentable allowed for our reservation. So the host who was eating a sucker/lolly pop pointed us into the bar area for "dinner". Our server/bartender was a middle aged woman/human tornado running around the place in circles. Service was horrible. There were multiple staff members available and no one helped her or us. Seemed like they enjoyed watching her drown with her seemingly overwhelming 4 tables (9ppl), this was obvious from the laughs heard behind her back when she would leave the bar. The "teamwork" was awful, and from what I know about Hilton this should not be tolerated. From simple appetizers taking over 40min, sighs from our server when we asked for water and another sigh from the woman who brought out our food when we asked her to take our dirty plates that I had conveniently stacked to make easier I was throughly disgusted by the entire experience. We paid our tab and got out of there as fast as we could.  In fact we actually left and went somewhere else to get dessert and drinks to continue the night at a place where we felt welcome. We live local and will continue to steer people clear of this place. Every possible customer should skip this place and just go to Z-Tejas just a mile down the road.  If I could give 0 stars I would.
