I finally made it to Postino! Nobody ever wanted to go with me and I was finally able to talk my friend into going to the one next to my hair dresser. Arcadia!    Like I said, I went with a friend for lunch and it was so freaking delicious!  I ordered the Prosciutto with Brie Panini, which includes...  Prosciutto with triple cream brie, fig jam and arugula. I think they spread honey or something else on the bread.   I would like to say my friend was really hesitant to go because she just didn't like Postino based on past experiences.   However, she had gone to the location on central, not Arcadia. This info will be important later. Back to my yummy panini.   I have never been crazy about prosciutto but Brie...one of my fav cheeses. Add sweet fruityness to it and I'm sold!   Based on the options on the menu this sounded like the best choice for me and I am so glad I know myself so well.  The generous amount of meat combined with the perfect amount of cheese on great bread all brought together with this amazing sweet spread and some healthy greenage.   I mean it was probably one of the greatest things I have eaten in a long time.   This was so true that 3 days later I told my husband we are going for lunch as I must eat this sandwich again! This time we went to the central location.   So not the same. :(  The meat portion was half and the brie was just off and my sandwich was just not spectacular. Hence why I think my friend was against Postino for so long. She had only ever been to central.   So I highly recommend Postino but I can only recommend the Arcadia location and it's the only one I will go to. Even though it's far for me, it's worth the drive past the central location onto Arcadia.   Not joking....Amazing! Eat it!

One of my favorite places to go...just lost not only my respect but my money.   They had the same sale on the same day for weeks on end. This same sale since i started going here. Never had signs, they would just come up and tell you.  So today when I go back again, the only thing on sale was clothes!!!   At the check the nice cashier was ringing everything up 50% off and out of no where the oldest lady of the group said no, only clothes are on sale. They disagreed and I explained to the older lady I have always been told these items were on sale on this day.   The oldest lady who was Adamant about the sale said it wasn't true. The other two ladies disagreed and wanted to give me the discount but she kept saying that sale never existed.   As I was walking away she said to the other cashier " that wasn't true". I turned around and said I will bring you back my receipts to show you I am not lying! What I won't do when I come back is spend another dime of my money.   You do NOT call your customers liars!!!!   Perfect example of how you lose business and eventually...doors closed.   When big spenders like me come in and clear your shelves, you do what it tales to keep them coming back.   So disappointed. You get two stars because you are a cause and and you have two wonderful associates who should have more power.   Do your store a favor and get rid of that terrible lady.

I think not!  Would you turn away away a 20+ people party? They must be extremely unhappy with the company they work for because this is the 2nd time in a row I had a bad experience at this location with employees.   I wanted to try again because the manager, who I guess is no longer there (good for her) was so nice about the last incident and begged me to come back and bowl on them. One of the employees ruined mothers day for everyone who came with us. So it wasn't some small trip bowling.   So I attempted a return with 20+ close friends. Apparently they do not have group rates and apparently they are doing just fine financially that they can treat you like dirt for absolutely no reason other than you asking questions about packages.  The manager Jason is beyond rude and should not be in charge and apparently they do not hold up what they offer. Where is my free bowling? I paid for something I never got last time.   Not only did he not help me work this out he said he did not want our business because it's a holiday weekend anyway.   So not only did he lose FOREVER my family of 5's business but the 20 other people who were going, along with their friends and their friends. I mean...stupid move kid.   I was planning on having a bowling party at the end of volleyball season, as I coach/volunteer and I will no longer be having it here.  Oh and I WILL tell all the parents why. I am also going to stop by my daughters school and chat about the free AMF bowling cards they send home and explain how Jason treats the guests when they try to go there.   NEVER GO HERE MY FINE YELP FRIENDS.   I have been bowling since I could hold a ball and this is not the place to give your money. I know that some location in this valley will be raking in a ton of money from me alone this weekend though. I will yelp who the lucky winner is! :)   This is will be on Facebook displayed to my 700+ friends. Advertisement is the best.

Chinese....yuuummmm!   I have been going here for as long as I can remember. They opened in 1982 and I remember my Grandma taking me here regularly. I am 31 now so....I have been going there...FOREVER. I now take my girls there and it's one of there fav places to go. Their is a reason a privately owned 80's decorated chinese restaurant that is located in the most not busy area of phoenix  has been able to stay open for almost 30 years. It's the food! I honestly have always ordered the same thing so I will tell you what that is  and a little insight on what my other family members think of other things.   The lunch special is the best deal. You get soup, 1 item such as house ckn or sweet and sour ckn etc, giant egg roll, 2 fried wontons and fried rice.   Egg Drop Soup - Yummy. This is the only place that I will get it. I have tried other places but no go.   Sweet and Sour - My Mom and Step-Dad get that and absolutely rave about it.   Beef Skewers - TO DIE FOR! That is all that needs to be said.  House special Chicken. So freaking good! It's original and delicious. I recommend it highly.   My husband gets the Orange chicken and loves it. He is the pickiest person I know and he loves the place.   I have never ordered anything other than the Hot Tea to drink. It is one of my fav things about going. I remember as a kid putting one ice cube and 3 packets of sugar in my little bitty cup. Now it's one ice cube and no sugar and I love it.    The portions are large so you will have left overs and nothing is better than left over chinese!

*** IF I COULD GIVE 0 STARTS I WOULD***  DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD/EASY MADE MONEY HERE!!!!   I stopped here on Thursday of last week for the first time. I was looking around for some photography props and had found an ok chair. The price was double if not triple what it should me. I mean it's a chair made out of pallets and they are charging $60 for it. Ridiculous. So I went inside and kindly asked if they negotiated prices and she said NO they are set. I said ok and thought no biggie. Because it was so dead I had asked her in a kind voice if it gets busy for her on the weekends and she said in the snottiest voice "I don't know, I don't work the weekends". She never stopped to speak with me or look me in the eye. So flipping rude.   The day this place closes is the day I am throwing a party. I am so for supporting  local business and this lady and place makes it hard to sell this to others. She/they ruin it for other business owners.   List to the people coming to your store and make a change or say bye bye to your store.

This is my favorite special occasion coffee shop. I say that because it's so far from home so...I only go when I am downtown...which is usually special. The location is why they do not get 5 stars. I hate that they are far. I want them to be in my backyard....I mean come on...I have a pool and everything.   The coffee and delicious treats are amazing.  Lots of tables to do table stuff. Lots of modern hipster chairs to do modern hipster stuff on. Outside seating is also available for those nature lovers. The art on the walls makes me wish I collected art.   It's an all around good time...so go!

I usually wait to write a review on a place after going a few times, to make sure it's not a bad day or a really good day.   I have been going to ikea since it opened here, I don't know like 8 years ago, maybe longer.   The last few times I have gone to Ikea the employees have been a nightmare. The store is always out of stock of at least 2 things you want and you can't buy them online. Why? It's dumb.   What decade are you living in that you can't order an out of stock item online? Tillys, sunglass hut you name it, they do it.   The website is not accurate regarding the stock and even the employees tell you don't look at that, you have to call. Why?   This last time I went an employee told us an item was discontinued forever and they will never be back in stock.   So I asked him if we could buy the floor display. He then said you would have to go back up and ask them. Really? You can't use that Phone for this customer and call and ask for us? Really?   So my hubs goes back up and on the table it has a new tag on it. He calls and tells me this, so I talk to a different guy, realizing the last guy was an ass.   He said oh no it should be in next week. Great.   I would be bragging about how great that guy was except he saw me struggling to push a cart and pull a pallet cart around by myself and threw by 2 sheets away that had the rest of my list on them.  I had no idea where anything was.   I looked everywhere but really didn't think he would do that, but he did.  I made him get them out of the trash. He proceeds to tell me he saved my day.  What a jerk.   All in all, I probably won't be back for a long time. I am an Ikea freak, my whole house is ikea. I however refuse to put money into a business that treats their customers like garbage.   I did call customer service and that was like talking to a wall about the issue.   Peace out Ikea.

*** IF YOU ARE A TRUE FAN OF HAIR AND WANT AN HONEST REVIEW, TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS***  I am not going to name my stylist because I do not want to ruin her business and I am not sure if what happened is because of salon rules or what.    My long time stylist gave it up to be a mommy so I was on the stressful hunt for someone new. I went to Snapdragon based on the reviews on Yelp.  I called the salon and had asked for a specific person but was pushed to another and was told how great she was and who she trained under etc. I was beyond excited and my anxiety had gone from a 9 to a 3. Huge for me.   My first trip was ok. My stylist is cool and easy to talk to. I had scheduled my daughters to get their hair done as well. My stylist did my oldest daughter and some random stylist did my youngest.   Long story short.   My younger daughter walked out looking the same as she walked in. I later found out the girl didn't even wash her hair!   Never in my life have I experienced that. I couldn't figure out why she braided her hair in the front as my daughter did not want that. Now I know. To hide the lack of cutting and zero washing.   My older daughter got a trim...nothing worth talking about and my hair was meh.   My Color was good but my cut straight up sucked. They style your hair kind of and then cut it. But it won't fall the way you do it because you will style it different.    If I wasn't going on vacation I would have gone back. I had this weird bang thing going on that I couldn't do anything with. I can do anything with my hair but I just couldn't do anything with it!   I paid more than I have ever paid for a half head of highlights and a trim. Beyond more! So the fact that my cut was not good was disappointing at best.  SECOND APPOINTMENT:  To be honest I had realized my appointment was scheduled for a week away and I was scrambling to find another place due to price and what I got for it. I was super busy and just decided to try again and deal with paying such a high amount. I also thought well maybe it was because it was my first time with her and she needed to do more to get my hair where she wanted it color wise.   So I went back....big mistake.   I arrive in the morning at 10am. THE AIR WAS BROKEN! IIT WAS STILL SUMMER!  Why didn't they call me and say hey the air is broken would you like to re-schedule?   I was already there and decided to get it over with. It was miserable, I was sweating and about to pass out under all the foils (lots of hair) and cape.   She didn't want to put me under the dryer because it was so hot, but it was hot anyway!!!   I would have rather been under the dryer for 10 minutes than in the hot salon for 2 while my hair didn't lift!   So when she realizes it's not working she ends up putting me under the dryer anyway. So at this point I am beyond miserable and feeling nauseated and wanting to run from this place.   Finally she says ok we are ready!  If I remember correctly she had already cut my hair. Anyway I was at hour 4 and all that had been done was cut and color. 4 hours!!! I told her I have to go because I had other plans.   So I go to check out and you would think after all that misery they would discount something or give free product...something to make up for that disaster of an experience.   Nope, $220 later before tip. Half highlight and a basic trim and previous cut FIX mind you. Fix from the last mistake!   My hair cut this time was ok but my color...oh my color.   YOU CAN SEE MY ROOTS ON ONE HALF OF MY HEAD!!!!!  If you are going to charge that, it better be next to perfect. It was the worst color job I have ever had....ever.   I wanted nothing to do with this place so I just listed it under I got totally ripped off. I am not kidding, I'm not sure if it's the stylist I was with or the salon or what but these reviews are crazy. I think it's friends or reviewing.  Way over rated. I have had better hair and paid half that.

***12/5/2012*** RESPONSE TO NICOLE'S LOVELY COMMENT  Thank you so much for proving my point. I am so sorry, I didn't know I had a deadline of less than 3 days to get back to you.   I mean I am just at the ready to give you more of my time and money to waste. Are you kidding me? I am a very busy Mom who does not need to drop everything to answer to you.  In this day and age you need to make sure you have your facts straight because everyone has proof of what is going on during their day. I can upload images of text messages I sent during my appointment proving times, what happened and that no, there was no lunch and no children at it.   I am not the type of person to let someone take advantage of me as a customer and then try to slander my credibility when I speak up about a bad experience.   I couldn't figure out how you had such high reviews but I think I get it now you bully people into changing reviews.  Here are my responses to your numbered inaccuracies. Proof can be provided if anyone would like.   1. ok, I think a few numbers down you will find this is not true.   2. I was happy to find you guys until I had a bad hair cut, a terrible second visit and half a head not correctly colored. I didn't realize this until I did my own hair..when I got home.   3. My appointment was at 10 am so check your facts. Your front desk girl and my hair dresser and a few others were talking about it as I walked in. It's obviously your word against mine but I don't care. I know it was broken the second I walked in. Did they talk about how an employee of yours was nice enough to get fans for all of us...probably something the owner should have bought etc. Why would it even matter?   4. Spent time in the back? I think you are mistaking me for somebody else. I know she sat me back there for 10 minutes but the rest of my time was spent in her chair getting foiled, or under the dryer when the waiting wasn't working. 10 minutes vs. 4 hours...wow you are right. What am I complaining about.   5. In order for my daughters to tell you they loved their hair, that would mean that they were with me the second time. They were not so past tense...??? So confused.   6. $20 for a hair cut is fine but you should probably let people know that you are not washing kids hair. This is a new one for me. She is 11 not 3. I would expect her hair to be washed. Not only that it still had dead ends. She didn't look different.   7. Now I know you said my stylist remembers everything in great detail. So I am not sure what happened here. But my girls were NOT with me during my second visit. My appointment was on October 9th. at 10 am. You see they go to school. So it's not possible for them to have been with me. I would go so far as to get records from their school to prove the lies you are telling.   As for eating lunch, I have text messages with dates and TIMES to my Mother asking her to please bring me food because my hair was taking forever and I was starving.   She couldn't leave because they were replacing her windshield. Again...more than happy to upload the image of the texts for anyone to see. In fact I am looking at them now.   So NO I did not hang around a hot salon with wet hair with my 2 daughters eating lunch talking about the plans I had for the day.   I ran out as fast as I could to try and make the appointment I almost missed, with wet hair starving! All the while my kids were in school...learning.   8. I pre-booked my appointment because I am a loyal client and that is what I do every time. At the time I was annoyed at the situation but my full annoyance didn't peak until I saw my hair in it's full terrible glory.   Please remember at the time I was annoyed that the salon owner didn't provide fans, an apology or a call to warn clients. My stylist did her best to handle it. That is why I will still not give her name.   9. You act like I have no idea how long it takes for high quality highlights. It did not take her that long last time and she styled my hair. I have no problem paying the money...it's what I get for it that is the problem.   10. I shouldn't have to ask for you to give good customer service. This is common sense...come on now.   11. I am not a 1 star reviewer. Look at my stats...please do the math correctly.   All in all you have proven my point. Bad service followed with a deadline or else we will slander YOU. Nice.

I am incredibly honest with my reviews and keep readers in the loop start to finish.  Nikole apparently did call me in the last few weeks to offer a refund. I have changed phones and did not know of this. I am waiting to find out more about this. I do think this is a decent gesture and not the norm in the salon market. So I have added a star... I will let you know what comes of this.

I have been here twice and had great experiences both times. I just saw World War Z in the Cine Capri and it was AMAZING. Huge screen, great sound and comfy seats. Also, they keep a manager in there to keep the idiots in check, WHICH I LOVE!

Had lunch here today and it was exactly what the tum tum ordered. Pita Jungle has been in my regular rotation for years now and I would recommend it to all.   My usual - Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus and grilled chicken.                   - Greek Salad                           Or                   - Lavosh Shawarma Wrap. Served with a side Greek salad.                           Or                   - The Caribbean Salad is a delicious change up!!!!!    I always wash it down with a Green Tea! They use a local company and I am always for localness.  :)  I have yet to run into a Pita Jungle hater. They have a ton of yummy items on the menu....something for everyone. The service is steller and the price is always right.

Totally bummed.  I have been going here since June of 2008 and learned to ignore the front desk. The worst customer service people ever. They are not friendly and give the impression you are annoying them. That has been the norm since day one. My friend actually went with me originally but had such a bad experience with the appt and then the follow up with the Manager was laughable so she never went back. I however have major issues with my jaw and back it's next to required for me. So the occasional appt mix up over the years and horrible people that great you were not enough to deter me from my appt.   About 8 months ago things got pretty bad and I was going to cancel but I had saved up so many massages from lack of wanting to go.  I needed to barrel through them so I could cancel with out losing them.   My normal guy had just quit and they gave me Jennifer. A-mazing! She  was so good I no longer wanted to quit. Not only did I not quit I upped my appts to 90 minutes.  Love love love her!   All of a sudden the issues are beginning again. I have moved further away so these mix ups are a much bigger deal. After another appt mix up last Sunday  I had to cancel...I couldn't deal with it any more. Sadly I will be moving on to another company.   I recommend the same for you.  This one just lacks customer loyalty and quality of service.  I can't ignore it anymore.  The only saving grace for them are the Gems they have like Jennifer.

This is your warning! Don't throw your money down the Next toilet!  I have noooo problem labeling this the worst place. The service, food and coffee are all on the same level of terrible.   I live in the neighborhood and was very excited to try this awesome looking establishment.   1st experience - I had already gotten a coffee earlier in the morning so I just needed breakfast and an excuse to check out the inside. I decided on the breakfast burrito that the counter chick had recommended.  I paid with my  cc and signed the receipt. Her happy go lucky attitude changed so quickly I thought a killer with a knife had walked in behind me!  Then it hit me. I didn't tip her! OMG is she really that mad? I thought she would just grab my burrito from the case and hand it to me. I didn't get coffee so why tip? I thought it would be a 2 second transaction.   Well...she made me wait 10 minutes and I was the only one waiting. I couldn't believe it. What a fantastical first experience. That is when I decided...nope not for me.   Then I ate my burrito and it was the worst thing to hit these lips in quite some time. It was horrible. I would imagine having this in a hospital cafeteria. I'm not kidding...bad.   About a month later I was looking for a place to study and meet up with a friend. I decided to try Next again. It's soooo close and I hadn't tried the coffee yet so why not.   I ordered a black and white mocha.  It was not good. It reminded me of gas station coffee...the kind you get on long ass road trips. The kind you put your cup under hit the button and let go about 1/3 from the top.   My friend arrived about 30 minutes before they closed and ordered a drip. She went for a refill about 15 minutes later but they had dumped all the coffee!   They had just had a convo with her. They couldn't have forgotten about the customer they just sold a drip to who might want a refill! They were so worried about closing up and going home. They had dumped everything and closed up 15 minutes before closing time.   That is crazy to me! I can't stand the service the food or the coffee at Next. It sucks because the space is amazing...they just suck badly!

Honestly I would normally go to a specific lady to get my nails done but she rides solo and my friend wanted to get her nails done with me at the same time.   So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest.   The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended.  I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time.   The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5.   The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. It's not dirty it's just not 5 stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck.   All in all I will probably be going here from now on unless I want a more trendy color other than Red. Walk right in and walk right out with great nails and zero guilt on how much you just spent. :)

They should just shut this location down. I can not get a drink to come out of that store correctly to save my life. I am not exaggerating, my drinks are wrong more than they are right. I will give them some credit, when I order a drip..they nail it ever time.   This issue has been going on long before the whole "New management" story.   They write out your drink right and then you walk out with it completely wrong.  Wrong sizes, missing ingredients...obvious ingredients and my favorite, coffee grounds at the bottom of your cup.   AVOID at all costs. Trust me, the drive down the road to a different Starbucks is worth your time. I promise.   I go to this location everyday for one reason only, it's super close to my house. I try to go to locations by my school or work but in the morning when you want your coffee before your drive you hit up the one closest to you.   I have called and called and called and called to try and let them know something needs to change. Eventually the business will dry up and the lazy employees will be with out a place to go to work.   Today was my final incorrect drink. I will be taking my daily spending to a new location. Trust me, the amount I spend will make a dent.

Jenn did my hair yesterday and it was AMAZING! It's just beautiful absolutely beautiful! I was there for about 3 hours but I have a lot of hair and that includes styling. The time flew because she is so easy to chat with. I was surprised when I looked at the time.   The Salon: The location is far for me but I love it. The chairs are the most comfortable I have ever sat in. The sinks are awesome as they adjust to how you sit. Love it. The lighting and atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable.   I had a little trouble with my last salon but am so happy that I found Jenn in the process.

I just realized I had not done this yet. My absolute favorite place in all the world. Best food, atmosphere and music. Love love love it.  This is saying a lot because I am super duper picky.   Artichoke Heaven is a must! To DIE for!  Everything is good so I am not going to detail everything. I have never ever ever had a bad meal or experience!   I love you Main ingredient....will you marry me?

I am not sure where to start other than the positive.  We were greeted with a well informed and friendly young lady at the register. The menu is small which I like, so ordering was a breeze. The waffle fries are tasty and so is the mac n cheese. This is where I will part with the positive.   I ordered along with my daughter the pulled pork sandwich. Half of which (i'm kicking myself for the lack of picture) was fat. Not fat and lots of meat but straight up disgusting slimy fat that I had to pick out. Gross! The bun was mushy and so was half of the salvaged meat. The texture was terrible. I added 2 ribs for $2.99 and they were not even worth commenting on. My husband wanted to eat the rest of them and I was more then happy to share the ribs with out the warning. The look of disgust on his face might have been worth the trip. ;) Don't get the ribs or the pulled pork!!   The sauce selection was... sweet and gross, smokey and tangy (which I preferred) and spicy. Overall bad taste to the sauces. My young daughter couldn't even eat the sweet mild one as the taste was bad. She is a typical picky eater but this will be the first BBQ she wouldn't eat.   The brisket is ok...and I mean ok. I am not a fan of sausage but my hubby said it was amazing. So if you are going to check out this joint my suggestion would be sausage, waffle fries and mac n cheese.   Also...what kind of BBQ place does not have fresh brewed tea?? This is a first for me and a big disappointment. Make fresh brewed tea!!!   I love BBQ... a lot and I am shocked by these reviews. I hope I was just there on a bad night or something. I am all for local business and I hate chain restaurants...so I was pretty disappointed as I found myself wishing I was at Shane's rib shack down the road.

I just realized I haven't done this yet.   I have been having Kristin come to my house once a month since last September. One time and I was hooked.This girl is amazing! I have been getting massages on a regular basis for years and I am so thankful I finally found someone who is great at it. She brings a full table, fresh linens and relaxing music. I promise you will not be disappointed with her.... you will however have a new addiction. :)

*** UPDATE***  Just had a glorious experience with U Swirl....that is sarcasm. I am a big fan of yogurt and so I have been going to u-swirl as it is close to my house. I drop about $30 every time I go (fam of 4). I have been saving up the stamp cards as I have done in the past with other yogurt places. I literally  have 4 full at this point.   So I decide to use one tonight. I am the only one getting yogurt tonight so why not use a card. It says free 16oz yogurt with toppings. So I grabbed the small cup and got my usual. I go to check out and the kid says ok your total is $2.25 or something. I said Oh no I have a free one. He said right...we pay for up to 16 oz. I said...that's not what it says. He said that's how it is. before I could even finish asking him my husband had handed him our card to pay and he ran it. Literally seconds.  It all finally settled on me and I was like No, this is wrong...I have spent $100"s of dollars here over just a few months. This is not how you treat your customers. The stamp cards are misleading. I have never experienced this with other yogurt shops.   So I said...I don't want it.   He said...you already paid for it.   I said..refund.   He said I can't, I don't know how.   I said....that's not my problem.   He was just like all the other workers at U-swirl (see below) Incredibly rude and unapologetic. You see...it's not us the pesky customers giving him a pay check every week. It's the money gods above. We are just the annoyance they have to deal with as we are such a bother.   So he goes and get a shift leader. Not a manager (she made that quite clear). I explained everything and she processed the refund. She then took my yogurt. Oh and I had to ask for my punch card back.   LOL. I thought I was in la la land. I couldn't believe what was happening. The WORST customer service I have experienced in a long time.   I love how U-swirl thanks you for all your money spent. Yes...spend $100 and we will take of $2.00. Wow...oh and we will put a pretty bow of A-hole attitude on top. They would rather my yogurt sit and melt on the counter and upset a consistant customer than honor what is on the card?    I  hope that $2.25 was worth it. I know, I know, the frozen yogurt world has very little competition so of course you can treat your customers as you please. ;)  Honestly, what it comes down to is they are misleading with the punch card. You should say up to 16oz free with toppings. Oh and a side note...my Mom lives in the neighborhood. When I told her she said they have never once charged her for her free yogurt and it has always been more than 16oz.   So with all of that said...Starbucks got my money today and any other yogurt shop in the valley will get my money...u-swirl will no longer be cashing in from me, my family or my friends...and that's a lot of people. Good work team u-swirl!   Friday  June 1st 2012  *******************************************************************************************   Well I have moved and u-swirl is now my local fro yo spot. The yogurt is very good but the customer service is very bad so let me break it down for you.   The location has plenty of seating inside and even a few tables outside which is nice. I'm not a fan of the setup as it gets backed up very easily but whatever...that will never change...so no biggie.   My usual is cake batter with butterfinger pieces and shredded coconut on top. Yum! I also enjoy the banana but only when they have peanut butter. Bring back peanut butter! I wasn't a fan of the tart but I'm picky about my tart so I'm sure it's great. My husband only ever gets the tart so it must just be me. They have a great variety of toppings and everything is clean.  I would honestly give this place 5 starts if it weren't for the people at the registers. I have never been to a yogurt shop where the people look at you like they want to kill you. It's incredibly uninviting and I feel like I'm bothering them by being there.  They do not smile, they do not say anything really other than put it down and you can take it off now...in such an annoyed tone.   Stop  ruining fro yo night with your negative vibes. The last time I went in the girl at the register just stood there with a sour puss chatting it up with who I can only assume was a friend of hers. It's just weird that this is ok. Anyway..that is my only rant. Other than the employees it's pretty perfect.

Finally something different to try.   This place is pretty great and super hard to explain. It's so light and fluffy, not like a snow cone but ice like for sure but milky however not even close to being like Ice cream, gelato or froyo. With that said, it's a must try just for the experience. They offer a great variety of toppings but nothing crazy like fruity pebbles or gummy bears.   The only thing it needed was more toppings. I would suggest asking for extra of whatever toppings you get.   My daughter chose carmel as one of her toppings and holy wow, probably the best carmel I have ever tasted...sorry churn.   I can't wait to go back...I kinda want to open up my own shop on the north side of Phoenix.   Loved it!

I'm just going to jump right to it. We paid $45 for myself, my husband and my 14 year old.   We got 2 lg pasta dishes and a small. All were Terrible and cold.   We order a side of potstickers which were hot in spots and ice cold in others. Not sure how that happens but that's when I got nervous. Being pregnant the thought of food poising is always in the back of my mind.   The cheesy bread looked like cheesy bread that lacked cheese that had been sitting on your counter all night. Dry and not hot.   We asked for our money back on the pot stickers and we got replacements to go instead. Wow, thanks...just what I wanted food to go?!?!   Just horrible! Probably the worst place I have ever eaten. I want my $45 back please!
