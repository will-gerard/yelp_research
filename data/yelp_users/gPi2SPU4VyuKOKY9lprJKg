Biggest let down.  I purchased a GrouponNow on 2/9 for 2/10 to use between 3:30 and 11:45pm. My husband and I had made plans and arranged our schedules so we could try something new, when we arrived at 6:30pm the place was dark. What bar/grill is closed on a Friday night at 6:30pm? Reading the other reviews, sounds like maybe they went out of business although there were no signs or anything. I tried to pull up the company website but just displays a black screen. I also tried to call and it just kept ringing until I got a message that the mailbox hadn't been set up yet. Groupon refunded my $$, but I won't be trying this place again.

Took a parks and recreation beginning dog obedience class in fall of 2013 and spring 2014.  Instructor was great and this provided a great bonding experience for my dog and I!
