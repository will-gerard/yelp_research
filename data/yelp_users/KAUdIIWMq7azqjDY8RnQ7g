It's not Rosco's and the menu is much smaller, but the food is good and not microwaved. I liked it although the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes.

Gonna make it short and sweet.. Great food. Huge selection with alot of Vietnamese dishes and more options than you could go through in a month. Huge portions with plenty of fresh ingredients and all the good condiments like Sriracha. Really cheap. Awesome value!

Been eating here for years and I try something new every chance I get. I love the food and every dish shines in its own way.  Go there, meet some friends or take a date, try anything. You'll be back!  The drinks are cold and strong & the atmosphere is great. A rare combo in this town.  Also a great place to celebrate St. Patties Day, green beer & all.  Reverse happy hour 11-1 Free & fast Wi-Fi

Went to your Tempe, Arizona store yesterday with an electrician friend that recently lost his leg and now has a prosthetic leg. He can walk but it makes him very tired and sore to walk too much.  I wanted to upgrade his home PC to help him be able to work more from home since he's no longer able do do 1/2 the climbing his trade requires and his employment options have been reduced greatly.  When I went in I asked where the carts or wheelchairs were for customers. Having seen them in most medium to large size retail outlets, the thought a store as large as Fry's Electronics Tempe not having them hadn't crossed my mind.  It has now crossed. I am now cross.  This is especially irritating since when that store was an Incredible Universe back in 1997, they provided them. Guess they liked to put a dash of empathy & kindness before the bottom line of outfitting a store with a few wheelchairs.  Subtract my business from that bottom line.  Member of humanity, Kyle

Great food & killer drinks. Crazy rum drinks in big bowls that make you feel like you're in the tropics. The food is unique and very tasty. Great place to take a date. Fire pit outside and a really nice covered patio.

Great prices, great service, no price gouging.  If you're in Queen Creek, San Tan Valley, or Florence this is gonna be your best bet for automotive work. I'm a real bargain hound and I called around for prices and they beat Discount, Sams Club, Costco & Firestones prices on tires and Auto Zones price on a battery and put it in for free saving me some time and $.

Great staff, top of the line equipment and a very friendly and inviting place. I'm a guy that gets pedicures on my Flintstone feet. (I'm not touching them!) Some places crack jokes in other languages & aren't very comfortable for men. This was not the case here. I will be back!

Been there twice now and ordered different items to make sure I wasn't passing judgment on just one dish.  Tried a couple of the staples of all Chinese joints; beef & broccoli and chicken teriyaki. The beef and broc was about 3.5 stars, good portion but the veggies weren't cooked right. The chicken teriyaki was horrid. Literally the WORST I've ever had including the mall food court. If you were to put the "chicken" that they used in the dish in front of anyone I'd be willing to bet they couldn't guess what kind of meat it was by looking at it. It tasted very odd and like it was half processed fat and had a crispy texture inside that was rather sicking. To top it off they put it on top of a bed of shredded cabbage (weird huh?) which gets mixed in with the "meat." I recommend you stay clear of this dish.  The other 2 things I didn't care for was the egg-rolls and the egg-drop soup. The egg-rolls ($1 a piece) were very small and mostly wrapping. You're better off getting them from Jack-n-the-Box. The egg-drop soup had sweet corn in it which I'd never seen and didn't care for. Some restaurants use cornstarch to thicken it but never corn.  Bottom line; It's the closest thing we've got out here for many of us but you might want to go to Jungle Buffet or Panda Express which I'd rate slightly higher than Chen's. If you do go to Chens-anyone-seen-my-cat-Chinese place just stay away from the chicken teriyaki and tell 'em no cabbage.  EDIT: Bobo's China opened up across the street. The food is much better there & the portions are bigger. Don't go here at all.

$40 PER PERSON cover on a Thursday night after 1am our group which was over half attractive girls. That's not a cover, that's assault and rape. Their loss though, our party (that was mostly hot girls) decided to just walk through a dark alley in South Phoenix to get fucked up and wake up with sore heads and no money. This was after the Steve Aokii set at Marquee Theatre sometime close to 1am. They couldn't even tell us about what time they may close. Unreal.

If you or the person you take out knows and loves authentic & very fresh sushi at very reasonable prices then this is the place to go. The chefs behind the bar speak Japanese and not Spanish. While they don't do alot of fancy custom "Americanized" rolls like some Scottsdale douche was complaining about, their sashimi is amazing! Try the Toro "fatty" tuna and the seared tataki is the best I've ever had (Over 80 diff sushi places coast to coast)   Of all the places I've ever had sushi if I could only pick one to eat at on a regular basis then Kampai would be that choice hands down.   When I do out on a date this is one of my top choices of places to eat.

I eat sushi every chance I get coast-to-coast.  I love sushi like a ginger loves sunblock.  I've had some mind-blowing sushi in the past 15 years and I've had some that was as bad as the midget standing waist high to your girlfriend telling her that her hair smells nice.  The decor wasn't bad at all in the place, I liked it a bit except for the 2 giant plasma TVs on a golf channel. I hate that crap. Either go traditional sushi bar style or go Scottsdale style. People don't usually go to sushi bars to watch sports and it switches the focus away from the preparation on the sushi which is a great part of the experience in my opinion.   Once the waitress served us I ordered some edamame, miso soup,and  the seared tuna tataki. The edamame was too soft, shriveled, and tasteless to eat. I sent it back because I could make better myself in a microwave from the frozen foods at Costco.The tataki is something I ALWAYS order at every sushi bar that has it. It's my fav dish if it's even done 1/2way right with fresh fish and the sauce is made well.  The Sake-bomber set ups came out but they didn't carry the mid grade cold sake I usually use for bombers so we got stuck with some hot sake that came out of a space bag box (The cheap crap)  I don't like doing bombers with hot, space-bag grade sake but I wasn't going to spend $40 on a bottle of good stuff for bombers and they lacked the option of a mid grade.  The tataki was cut too thick but this was to hide that the tuna was either old, hadn't been kept very cool, or been squashed. It was thick slices and it was just falling apart. Then there was the sauce. Bland and watery as any sauce I've ever had. Worst Tuna Tataki I've ever had and I've ordered that dish over 100 times in the past decade. We ordered a bunch of different rolls, some were interesting but nothing that I'd bother to type about.  The service was crap all night and there were only 4 tables with people in the whole place. Just a lack of caring.  We were all done with our food and had a enough beer left and almost enough sake to fill 1&3/4 of the 2 tiny shot glasses for the two of us to do 1 last sake bomb. I asked the guy if he could top it off (It was out of a plastic tube so it couldn't cost much!) and he laughed at me and blew me off.  I just spend $75 w/ everything at full price + tip in a 80% empty sushi bar with crap food and crap service and you can't come off less than a quarters worth of Sake so we can finish our last bomber? LAME.

Local residents in a small town 30 minutes south west of downtown Phoenix are ecstatic about the new changes that have been taking place at their local Applebee's in Laveen, Arizona. Super Official News stopped by the restaurant this weekend to investigate further what's making this hot spot so popular.  Restaurant manager Paul Horner explained just a few of the exciting changes that have been happening. "Every Friday and Saturday while we have our live Jimmy Buffet tribute band or gangster rap playing at full volume over the speakers from 3pm-2am, during breaks in the music, I've been letting my 8-year old son bang on his drum set that I just bought him for his birthday last month," Horner said. "We also just got two new microwaves to cook all the food that is on the menu. We named them 'Chef 1 and 'Chef 2, Horner laughs. "Preparing your steak how you want it will now be easier than ever! We also changed out the drainage system around the bar area so it doesn't smell like urine and human feces as much anymore."  Local resident Michael Spielman says he just loves the new changes at the Applebee's in Laveen. "They repaved the parking lot and I even heard they added new insulation to the roof of the building. Also, they have installed new air conditioning vents above every table that blow out the coldest air you've ever felt in your entire life. It's like traveling to Antarctica, but you're actually in Laveen! How cool is that, no pun intended," Spielman laughs. "Also I noticed there is more free mints and toothpicks when I walk in. Rip-roaring good times have come to Laveen!"  Gerald Byrnes who has been a server since the restaurant opened two years ago gave us some inside information on the appetizers and beverages. "No longer will our cold rubbery cheese sticks and alcoholic beverages that have no alcohol in them take an hour to arrive at your table. We have cut all our times down to 50 minutes or less or you get another alcoholic beverage with no alcohol in it free of charge! How awesome is that!"  Horner was more than happy to explain their new menus and additional usages. "Instead of 7-9 different menus per person we are now giving each diner 19 different menus of various sizes and colors to browse through. It will all be the same food but now just more spread out to make things more fun," Horner said. "Also to keep our customers safe, we are upgrading the menus to a type of plastic recently invented by NASA that has corners that can cut through glass. If the need ever comes up to fight off an attacker, our menus will work better than a machete."  Assistant manager Joyce Barth explained some of the other exciting new changes that have been made to improve the restaurant. "Our greeters and servers will no longer speak urban slang and other forms of language that make it difficult to understand when trying to order food," Barth says. "We have put each and every one of our employees through a rigorous 36-week course on how to properly speak to a customer in a language that can be understood by both the young and old." Barth continued, "When greeted at the front, no longer will you hear the familiar shouting of, 'Oh lawd, it's you folks again! Well git on in here and I'll get your seats right now! Not sure what's good right now for sitting, lemme check real quick for yall. You hang tight and chill, I be back after I git this figured out. I'll hit up my girlfriend Yolanda, she's one of the dish washers but she always has the down low on seats that aren't already taken up by some other fools'. This will now be replaced by, 'Hello and welcome to Applebee's. Would you like a table or a booth?'"  Horner told Super Official News that because of all these great new changes at his restaurant, unfortunately there will come sacrifices. "In addition to raising prices on all of our food* because of Obamacare and firing employees so we don't have to provide them with health care, we will also be forced to raise prices to cover all the costs of these new and exciting changes. But I think everyone in Laveen will agree that it's worth it the next time they come in for lunch or dinner or just to get a drink with no alcohol in it."  From Applebee's in Laveen to your family: We know in Laveen you have no options for good food so when you're starving, and you have no food left in your house and the grocery stores are closed, head on over to Applebee's. We'll make sure you have the worst f*cking dining experience ever!

A liquor store the size of an Office Max and with the best selection in the state, killer prices, and kegs! When I first walked in I wanted to quit my job and apply there (That wouldn't end well, trust me.) Great selection of beer, wine, and liquor and they also have snacks, cheeses, caviar, fine cigars, and everything else you need for your party.  I heard angles sing too when I walked in Heather!

Over-priced drinks. Generic redbull that tastes like crap. Crappy DJ running of equipment and speakers that look like they came from Spencers in the mall. The bartenders & waitresses were fat. The drinks were weak and slow to come. The Guinness was flat. No wings or bar food after 10ish. I'd rather go to Bevmo and order wingstreet.

I came in because the chalkboard on the wall said "$1 Coronas" and it is 107 out today. Sounded like a good way to cool off.  Went in. Only person there. Ordered a corona. Waited about 2 min for them to give it too me. I ordered the beer & it took the guy 2 min to get me a beer & lime slice in the middle of the day when I'm the ONLY customer AND I'm sitting AT THE BAR where I can almost reach them myself!?!?!?  I get the beer and they tell me it's $4. I'm like "What about the sign outside?" Him - "Oh that's just for ladies. Sunday is ladies special." Fine. Whatever. I paid because I was a hot & bit hung over and a cold beer was sitting right in front of me.  I ordered some hummus w/chicken  & bread because it was 1/2 off. There was only 1 piece of pita cut up and arranged to make it look like there was more. There was a fair amount of hummus but it was the worst I've ever had. If they made "instant hummus" that came in a powder where you could just mix with water then this would have been the generic wal-mart brand of that It still cost $5 when it was 1/2 price so that means normally they charge $10 for it. Rape.  I was still thirsty and they had Jager-bombs on "Special" for $5 (not much of a special IMO) and I ordered one for the "wings" I hoped it would give me. They brought out a jager & red-bull mixed in a glass. To clarify for those of you that don't know a Jager-bomb, by definition, is Jager in a shot glass dropped into a glass of energy drink. A Jager-Red-bull is the two mixed in a glass. It changes the taste and is a DIFFERENT drink even in bartender guides.  Then they wanted to ARGUE with me about what a Jager-Bomber was because apparently the customer is NEVER right to these guys. The argument was over when I pulled up www.Jagermeister.com on my laptop and showed them the official definition of a Jager-Bomber according to the manufacturer of the liquor..  It was also noisy. I like music or TV or w/e in most places but they had a radio AND TVs up loud and the mix of the two was just an annoying noise.   I complained to the manager and he gave me a few of their businesses cards that I could use for $1 Millerl Lites like it was something special to make up for everything. (There were also a stack of these cards I noticed on my way out that ANYONE could grab) Basically treating me like I'm retarded and brushing off my complaint without really doing anything to fix it.  I will never be back here. I wish it was still the Philly cheese-steak shop that it used to be years ago.  I'm sitting in here on their free wi-fi as I write this. It's almost like shooting someone with their own gun.

The price was unbelievable, the portions are HUGE and the food was truly great. There's not much more to say than that. I don't give out 5 stars lightly and I was shocked to find food that good at this small, order at the counter, hole-in-the-wall. Try the orange chicken, it's the best I've had at anywhere besides a couple of very upscale restaurants. I will absolutely eat here again next time I'm on this side of town.

First off it's the only real full-service car wash around Queen Creek, San Tan Valley or Florence.  EDIT: The wash has changed ownership and management, I went back and they did a crappy job on a full service.  I'd only recommend the $5 drive-through wash they have there

Outstanding! The corned beef hash is the best I've ever had hands down. The pancake flight has ruined most all other pancakes for me. It's TOO good. I can't recommend this place enough.
