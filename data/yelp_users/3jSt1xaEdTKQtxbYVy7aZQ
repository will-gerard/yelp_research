Took my 2.5 year old and 6.5 year old. We had a great day, not long lines, great slides and everything was well maintained. Plenty of family fun and we will definitely be back!

Delicious food, hideous service. We were a party of 8 and waited patiently for 45 minutes for a table. In our party was a 9 month old baby, 2 four year olds and my 75 year old mother. After our extensive wait, a party of 7 walked in and began eyeing a table that was clearly about to finish up. As the table got up, one of the individual's from the other group went up to the hostess, told her that they would take that table and our group could have another table (that was still seated and eating dessert). What?? We immediately protested but the hostess had already acquiesced. We sat around for another ten minutes, kind of shell shocked and trying to decide what to do (hungry little ones and A Lot of time invested). The manager offered nothing other than lukewarm apologies. I finally was so disgusted that I left. No excuse for seating the other table in front of us. Too bad the service is so poor because I do like, or should I say, liked, the food.

I had to take an unexpected trip to Verizon, not one I was looking forward to after my screen shattered yesterday.  Nemanja was wonderful, patient and explored every option from whether a new plan made sense to bringing out numerous phone cases so I could see them out of the package and make the right choice.  The folks at Verizon were very professional, courteous and Nemanja is very helpful and great addition to an already quality team (from those I have interacted with in the past) at this Verizon store.  I didn't care for the Verizon store near my previous residence so it is very refreshing to not dread going to the phone store.  It was very frustrating at the other location where I was subject to Verizon reps trying to convince me that I needed accessories or add-ons that I really didn't.  Not as bad as buying a car, but certainly not pleasant at the old store.  Not the experience here--they offer suggestions that are ACTUALLY helpful and useful and if you opt not to accept, they gracefully move on.  Great store! Thanks, Nemanja!

Cristian and John were great in meeting my business checking needs and getting me set up with new Wells Fargo services that made my solo business easier and more efficient. They were nice, knowledgeable and easy to work with. I have had a mix of experiences with different branches--some were not great--some were so so. This one is a great place with competent and helpful folks, a location where you won't mind going back or getting out of your car to go inside!!

One common thread that seems to run through the Pita Jungle restaurants is POOR SERVICE. Waited 50 minutes for food and then had to deal with a sour, condescending bartender. Oh joy. That was truly my last foray into Pita Jungle.

Bad experience with the front desk. If you can get through them the therapists are wonderful! Brash, arrogant early twenty-somethings are the gatekeepers. They should be replaced with more professional individuals who can better represent the facility.

Over the years I have moved from nail salon to nail salon, trying to find one where I felt like I was getting value for the money I was paying.  Late last year I discovered Ken Nails and Spa.  I have never been disappointed with their service--in fact the value is amazing.  Everyone is extremely pleasant and does a great job.  Usually Amy does my gel nails but recently others have, and the nails lasted for 2 weeks and looked great.  I love this place and will continue my visits every 2 weeks.  Thanks Ken and Amy--you guys have a winner!

Love, love this place! Lots of unique items. Great place to find thoughtful gifts. Everything from baby to jewelry to pets! I took my 4 year old and my 65 year old  mother and we all found things we liked.

The donut holes, old fashioned donuts and fritters are amazing. Coffee is delicious too! So much better than any of the competitors. I am not even a big donut person but every now and then when it is time for donuts, this is where I go!

We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for a relaxing foot massage. We ended up with the Combination (Foot + Head + Shoulder + Leg)-an hour for $40.00. Starts out with a warm pillow on your neck and stomach and a soak for your feet. Peaceful atmosphere and also good for couples. What a wonderful, relaxing yet invigorating massage! Very much on the therapeutic side. Very clean establishment and friendly staff. Great value and we will be back!
