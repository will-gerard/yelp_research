Food is top, servers are amazing. Even the music was ambient and perfect for the location. Until one day the owner was there.  He kept staring at us which was rude and when we asked to take out the rest if the food he gave us an aluminum foil and attitude. Lost 2 regulars there.

This store used to suck but it looks like recently they've shaped up. Top customer service and the pharmacist is very knowledgable.

It took 15 minutes to get us drinks, then order was wrong (missed an appetizer) then we were thrown the bill to our faces and asked if we were ready with the check a minute later. Wow

It all looked nice at first until we started noticing beggars on drugs sneaking inside the complex and looking through the trash. In addition to the hidden fees that we were hit with upon leaving the apartment in a decent condition. Good luck!

The amount of oil used in the cooking is beyond ridiculous. Mexican cook for indian cuisine? Really? My wife got diarrhea 1/2 after eating food. Enter at your own risk

Overall the Beer selection was good, but we didn't get service for 15 minutes, then got an attitude from the server (who happened to be training anoter employee- and what a training!) and to top it off we got an extra 3$ on our bill = major fail.  Walk in there at your own risk ya'll!

Very clean family owned business. Food is top, coming from someone who's knowledgable on Persian cuisine. Fav. Place to eat at whenever hungry: Sprinkle that sumac on yar meat!!

Leah is an amazing therapist that truly cares about her clients. She has very reasonable prices compared to others (and I've been to few)I will definitely recommend her to my friends and family.

Top food and a great value for the price. Hummus was super creamy and good, lamajun hands down one of the best I've had in the US.

It was quite a surprise to see such a spot sprout in the middle of Tempe, something that I've been looking forward to for a while now so we decided to try it and what a mistake. Customer service has got to be the worst I've ever seen maybe because it was the owners who were helping us out? The food was ok, nothing close to the real French deal. So we decided to give it another try and we were again greeted with what has got to be terrible service: the door was open so we walked in and asked to PICK some already made pastries but oh no they were closed and so they couldn't charge us even though they were charging for the crepes outside. Watched the guy making the crepes and his hands were dripping water all over them. Oh well, au prochain!

Every little detail is carefully mastered here, papa dams, teas, dishes, service. Hands down best indian spot I've eaten at for the longest time, and trust me I've had few.

The place is clean, friendly service and the food is off the hook!! Coming from someone who lived around the Mediterranean, the quality is definitely top top top! Good job and you'll def. have us coming back regularly
