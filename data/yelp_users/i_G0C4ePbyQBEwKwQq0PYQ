I just moved to Dallas, TX from Phoenix, and my husband and I have been constantly seeking something that is HALF as good as a Postinos. Not only is the wine selection great, but the bruschetta is life changing. I always ask for the servers favorite vegetarian options.  Try the creme brulee (and thank me later!)

I love the outdoor dining, but feel a bit claustrophobic inside. Expect long wait times during peak hours (and potentially slow service), but the food is good and the staff is friendly. Based on the wait times when I've visited, I've only been twice. Both pizza's were delish.

I've always enjoyed Fez, though it's never been my first choice for dinner or drinks. The staff is friendly and the food is decent, but the menu has never grabbed my attention. Drinks could be better priced, but they're at least well made.

My husband and I were married in Massachusetts, but wanted to celebrate with our friends in Phoenix as well. While searching for a venue, I found MonOrchid on Yelp and assumed they were way beyond my price range (I had visited once during First Fridays and LOVED the space.) I emailed for pricing information and quickly heard back from Stefanie with details. I was surprised that MonOrchid was a few hundred to a few thousand dollars cheaper than other downtown Phoenix venues. Stefanie told me that we could use our own caterers and alcohol, as long as we hired a professional bartender. If you've hosted an event, you know this is a savings of another couple thousand dollars.  Stefanie was great at helping us decide on a layout for our event. She made suggestions and allowed us to visit on several occasions. She was especially helpful in contacting our vendors to confirm details. On the night of the event, Stefanie even lent a hand in putting a nice cheese tray together while I was busy. She found a perfect balance in being friendly with our guests and not being distracting.   Parking isn't perfect at MonOrchid, but there is plenty on 2nd & Roosevelt.   This is a great, unique space that could be used for any kind of event.

I am obsessed with Lisa's Rum Cake so much that they offer a cake that they once tailored for my picky taste (try the Neapolichip, I promise you'll love it). I have used Lisa's Rum Cake for several parties, my wedding reception (they coordinated drop off with my venue for me!), holiday gifts, and I have purchased CUTS just for fun. I've also gone to their open-house tastings twice, which is almost better than Christmas.  Lisa's is famous for the flavor of their cakes as opposed to extravagant designs. While their cakes look beautiful, I don't believe they make the 10 tiered, jeweled, extravagant cakes you might see in a bridal magazine. Because they're focused on the flavor, I don't think they ever work with fondant (yuck). I also believe all of their cakes are non-alcoholic, if that matters to you.  The only thing better than their cake is their customer service. We called them apparently after they closed 3 weeks ago, and without asking who was calling, they said they would stay there for a half hour to let us purchase some CUTS. While we were there, Madison offered to make us a cake on the spot (!!!), and we had a blast chatting with her and Lisa, as well as the rest of the family.  Apparently, I've promoted them so much on my personal Facebook page that a friend wrote me thinking that I worked for LRK. I figured that was a good sign that I should officially write some sort of review.

First thing first: Get over your fear of carbs and calories and try the mac and cheese. Don't worry about adding meat or veggies to it, the thick cheese is perfect as it is. The grilled cheese is also great, so anything with carbs and cheese will make you happy.   Although the staff often forgets what the specials are, there is ALWAYS a cheap drink-of-the-day, and usually another deal as well (20% off all food, happy hours, etc.). They are also constantly supporting some kind of charity, so check out their website/facebook or the posters in the bathrooms to see what might be going on.  Because the majority of their seating is outdoor, the warmer months are rather quiet in the restaurant. The staff is always pretty outgoing, so even a slow day offers a good time.  A few imperfections: if you ask for a meal substitution, check your food before eating it. I've found meat in my food in MANY occasions, despite requests to make it vegetarian (usually at brunch). Also, the restaurant side and the bar side play different music at the same time. When you are outside the restaurant, you can usually hear both songs at the same time. Oh well.  I've probably visited Bliss ReBar over 50 times. If I still lived in Phoenix, I'd likely be there this weekend.

On March 23rd, I had a very poor dining experience at The House at Secret Garden and wrote a polite letter to management that evening. It is now over a month later, and I have STILL not received any response. Based on the poor food quality, incorrect menu listings, pricing and TERRIBLE customer service, I would not recommended The House to anyone looking for good food or good service.

Based on FEZ's customer service/management, they are truly a disaster. Earlier this week, FEZ mocked another Yelp reviewer by posting their profile (not their review), and encouraging their Facebook fans to join in on the joke. (The customer simply mentioned that she wished they used natural juices in their cocktails, but had commented on the former FEZ profile that it was "a nice place".) Unfortunately for them, many customers did not support this post, and responded accordingly. The manager, who identified himself on Facebook as Tom, proceeded to publicly attack those who disagreed with the post. About one customer, he posted that they were rude during their visit. He told others that they didn't know what they were talking about, and eventually deleted comments/blocked users if they didn't agree with him. After attacking many of their loyal customers online, someone at FEZ finally deleted the entire post. Perhaps someone had one-too-many of those cocktails without natural juices?  If I'm being honest, the food at FEZ isn't terrible (brunch is okay) and many of the servers are friendly enough. The food and service isn't better than anywhere else, so I'd recommend supporting a business that respects their guests more.
