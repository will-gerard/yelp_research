Bruschetta....YES PLEASE.    Fantastic food, fantastic service.  Can't wait to share an evening with my wife here again.

Wow, what an awkward experience.  My wife and I decided to go here last night for the (and last) time.  When you walk in, we weren't sure to seat ourselves or wait to be seated.  The hostess was apparently doing something else.  There was no sign, and the waitresses were not around.  We finally get seated and and salsa were brought out.  Salsa was good but a little bit spicier than expected.....Oh wait, we hadn't gotten any drinks yet or even our drink order taken!  That took about 10 minutes from being seated until we received our drinks.  By the way, if you were looking to put salt on your chips, expect it to be all over your table.  No wax paper or anything underneath the chips, so it spills out from the basket they put them in.  My wife ordered the green sour cream enchiladas and I ordered the machaca chimi.  Hers had barely any taste whatsoever.  Very, very bland.  My chimi on the other hand was full of flavor but a bit on the salty side.  I have no idea how long I waited to get a refill on my drink.  They give you the bill (eventually) and you go up front to pay.  I've seen a lot of reviews about the service.  I don't think it's the waitresses fault.  It's a small establishment but they seem very understaffed for the wait times.  I would have rather gone across the street to Macayo's or in town to Garcias Las Avenidas.

After a Valentine's Day debacle headed up to Anita's in Wickenburg, we decided to try this place.  The Green Chimichanga is ridiculously good.  Tasty, flavorful and not over-fried.  Friendly people, friendly service, good homemade Mexican.  Will definitely head up here again.

Excellent!  They did telemarket us, so we gave them a shot as we were not happy at all with our maintenance provider (has a first name and the last name is a country in South America).  They came out to look at our units (5 total in two places).  They tried to save them all, but unfortunately they couldn't be saved as our previous contractor didn't do a whole lot of maintenance on them and charged us every single time they came out even though we had a "maintenance contract" with them and pretty much ruined two of them.  So far, Acclaim has replaced 3 out of our 5 units on our property.  All are working perfectly with no hiccups whatsoever.  We received a fair quote inline with what we expected, we received numerous discounts, next day installation and the technicians knew what they were doing.  We now have more efficient systems and everything is what we expected.  I would recommend them to anyone else who needs their AC serviced or a new one. We are 100% satisfied.
