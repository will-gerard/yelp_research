The Cafe Bellagio came in very handy for my friends and I at after a long night at the Palms. I know that food always tastes better when you have been drinking, but the food was still better than I thought it would be. I had a huge Southwest Omelette that came with hash browns. It had chicken, cheese and some jalapenos to add some spice. I am not usually a fan of hash browns, but these were good and my friend was even eating them off my plate. It appears a bit pricey as expected in the Bellagio, but the portions were big.  It is open 24 hours so it should be always an option any time of the day!

My wife and I had this Subway location randomly after stopping for gas.  I wasn't a fan at all with it, but we had a gift card to use.  Their prices appeared to be $1 or $2 raised as the 6 " subs were around $5.  We decided to try something different and get the chicken chopped salad.  Not a good idea by us as it was CHOPPED to shreds.  Why does a salad need to be in tiny bites?  I have no idea, but it wasn't very good.  You could taste the flavors but the spinach obviously loses some of the natural crunch.  I would avoid this Subway if you can help it or at least just get a sandwich not a extremely chopped salad.

For airport food I give Pei Wei a four stars but it would be closer to three outside the airport. We had the teriyaki chicken fried rice for $8.35 plus an extra &1.00 for the fried rice. It had a bunch of veggie, chicken and plenty of teriyaki sauce. The portion size is pretty solid and can be shared by two people if you aren't too hungry. The price isn't really that expensive compared to a $4 Greek yogurt or other extremely overpriced options.  The service seemed nice and it will take about ten minutes to order because it is made fresh so FYI if you are in a huge rush for your plane. They are open late until 11.
