This so called DINER is the worst eatery I have been to EVER been to. I bought a groupon for this place and WISHING I never did. This was my first and last time I go to a place that believes they can charge you extra for "gyro sauce" and say that my groupon wasn't covering the sauce even though the groupon states that I have an certain amount of value. The service was ridiculous as well. It took the waitress 15 mins to take our food order and the place was dead. She only came over to us because the owner told her too. My grandma right from the start ordered the extra sauce wasn't told it was going to cost her extra. She had to ask for the sauce 3 times before it arrived to the table and then told her it was going to cost us more money....I then got so infuriated  the owner came over and told my grandma to open her gyro to find the EXTRA SAUCE (if you have to go searching for EXTRA sauce... I guess it  wasn't much of extra sauce..) .. Then told me that that there is a separate charge that wasn't covered.. I told him we were leaving and not going to pay for the food that wasn't going to be covered under our groupon.(90% of our food wasn't eaten) He told me he was going to call the cops. Which he did and the cops pulled me  over half way home and came to the conclusion that this wasn't a criminal matter and he would have to sue me. Which is fine with me who tries to sue someone for food someone hasn't eaten and was mostly paid for anyways!! This place will be closed in a year...
