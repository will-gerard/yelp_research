I don't typically like Mexican food, but this place was great. The food was good and they offered 4 different salsas with their complementary chips (beware the salsa is hot). The lunch wait was a little long, but all in all good job.

Terrible. The bar tender told us that we could get a table if we bought a bottle. One hour later, after we bought the bottle, the manager comes to kick us out of our table which was fine because he agreed to comp us the bottle. Later the bar tender cannot comp us the bottle because he claimed that he did not approve. This place is full of liers. Don't celebrate here. Happy birthday babe.
