Sky Harbor has upped their restaurant game! So many local and delicious places to eat, I so appreciate that because I don't like eating McDonald's every time I fly. Plus, I don't like getting ripped off just because I'm in an airport.   I walked from the C Gates to the A Gates (which if you don't know, is freaking far!) but what choice did I have, the beer was in the A Gates! I got my beer fast, with friendly service and what do you know, it was the normal and average price of $4! Me=Happy. But seriously, could we spread some beer love to the other less fortunate gates please?!   I accidentally went through security with my Bobble (Filtering Water Bottle) filled about 1/3 of the way. Ooops. The TSA Agent was nice and said if I wanted to keep it (which I very much did and a water snob) that he would walk me around and back through the Employee Lane to speed up the process. So I did. The end.  I keep hearing there's Free WiFi and I saw it on my WiFi list when I was there but it didn't didn't seem to work so that was very frustrating.   I also really hate that the gates are so so crammed together, if you don't like tight spaces, being touched by other human beings or the general feeling of being in an Earthquake Bunker built for 5 filled with 50, then good luck to you sir. Let's just hope you don't need to use the bathroom.

My favourite Chinese Restaurant. Better than PF or any of that nonsense. I order the Orange Chicken, Chicken Chow Mein or Mu Shu Pork and I love them all! I crave this place and its deliciousness, maybe it's the addictive MSG but for once, I don't even care!   On my last visit, the owner gave everyone a Chinese Calendar as a holiday gift which was kind! Fair warning, some of the staff are strange but most of them a great!   You should go there now.

Love me some Hot Bagels! Double Egg, Double Cheese all the way!  Fresh, amazing bagels and a huge variety too. I haven't had a bad experience here, ever, it always tastes wonderful. The staff are friendly and upbeat; and the price is nice.  I've only ever had breakfast here but they have lunch bagels too which look delish. The only sad part is when they run out of your favourite flavours of bagels...so get there early if you can or suffer the consequences.  My mouth is crying for Hot Bagels....

Fantastic portions for your money, especially during happy hour (aka customer appreciation), great service (the employees know their stuff!) and overall delicious!!   Need I say more?  Go there.

I'm kind over it. Very rare to find something cute and in good shape. It's a glorified Savers or Goodwill and lately I have not found anything that looks remotely in fashion, of quality or resembles something from a legit department store (which supposedly it all is haha)  So yeah unless I'm in a pinch for something last minute or for a one off event and don't mind it being in less than okay shape then I'll pop in when it first opens. Get there when it opens if you want to have a chance at finding something and also beat the crazies who get in the way.  Sadly it's just no longer the gold mine it used to be.

I only ordered a Pain Au Chocolat or Chocolate Croissant as some call them, and a coffee.   I did try some of the Cherry Crepes which were good. The whipped cream on the side was horrifically delicious, like you know there's so much fat in it but you can't help but scoop it up.   On to the bad part, our waiter was so grumpy and short with us! There were 12 of us girls, so maybe he felt overwhelmed? Still, no excuse for that, especially because we were not a demanding group by any means.   The other bummer was the Pain Au Chocolat, this is a French restaurant with crazy good reviews about their Pain Au Chocolat! It was dry and bland, there's no way it was freshly made that day. I've had better pastries from the grocery store bakery. Very disappointing.  I don't plan on going back.

Shame on me for not reviewing this place sooner!   The Macarons are amazing here, they're so good that they're indescribable. I can't do them justice but I'll try. First of all, they're big and in this case bigger IS better, they're light, perfectly chewy and deliciously creamy in the middle. No other Macaron can compare, I continue to try others in hopes that they might be as good but I'm always disappointed.   My absolute favourite is Raspberry, I've tried Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Caramel and I think at one point they had Lemon also. The Caramel straight up had real caramel in the middle, making it extra decadent.   They are just the most wonderful treat possibly ever.

I'm rarely disappointed when I come here, you know it's good when you can't decide on a flavour. There are plenty of times I go to other places and I can't pick a flavour for the opposite reason, because they all suck hahah  Honestly, I don't care too much about toppings and bottomings but if I did this place would be the best at it! So many options, I don't think you'd want for anything. If I do get a topping it's Mochi and theirs is always fresh and soft so yay! The place is always in spit spot condition, they are constantly cleaning and organizing which is great.   So it's all about Yogurt Flavours for me and whether it tastes like Yogurt or not, because I'd rather it didn't, there are some that do but it's not overwhelming. They make some of them so creamy and delicious that it tastes like Ice Cream :) They also have a good variety of Tart, Sorbet type style and more Yogurty ones too. A really great variety of everything including healthier options so that everyone can enjoy! Oh and it doesn't hurt the wallet, join their loyalty program and save even more!

Happy Hour is awesome! (Mon-Fri 3-6pm)  To be fair I came here more than a year ago, my first time inside by the bar and my second was outside on the patio. However, I do remember having a good time and being impressed with their Happy Hour offerings.   My husband and I each had a few draft beers and a couple of appetizers. One of which was the mini Margherita Pizza which was really good! My husband had the mini BBQ Chicken Pizza, he loved it but it was a bit spicy for my liking so beware.   The staff were great both times, ambiance was cool (keep in mind we didn't eat in the regular restaurant area or during dinner rush), overall, I had a pretty great experience both times! I just wish I didn't live in Texas so I could go back!    4 Stars only because I can't remember everything about my visit, I'll update when I go back!

Found this place on Yelp, saw good reviews and decided to try it out. It did not disappoint, pretty tasty!   Ambiance is lacking and the staff could be more customer service orientated. The prices are average but the Sushi menu is large so lots of options!   Overall, I had a good experience and left happy.

It beats the average Airport food option but Sky Harbor is not average, not any more. There are so many great local food options here and I wouldn't say that Barrio is the best of them by far. They had some beer of draft so that was cool, just mexican beer though which isn't very exciting.   I ordered the Pork something Burrito which said it was Enchilada Style, with a side of Barrio Fries (only because my husband wanted fries). It's kind of weird to serve Seasoned Fries with a Burrito but whatever. The Burrito was just Pork, nothing else, and it hadn't even been filled all the way so there were gaps where filling should be and it was very thin for a Burrito. The Pork was fine, didn't see or taste the Green Chilies mentioned in the description and the Enchilada Style consisted of a teaspoon of grated Cheese pathetically sprinkled on top. The Tortilla was so soggy and not in a saucy Enchilada sort of way, in a watery wet nasty kind of way.   I ordered it to go so I couldn't really say anything but next time I'm going somewhere else. There are tons of other really great options in this airport!

This place has my favourite Gyros thus far in my life. The regular is good but I go for the Chicken Gyro, no not the Shawarma, it's a Gryo! Thinly sliced chicken breast goodness!   The Pita is fresh, thick and pillowy. The Tzatziki is on point, the meat is tender and delicious, and the ratio of everything is perfect.   It's really depressing when it's over.

4 Stars because I've only been here once.  Pancakes on point! Breakfast Sammys for the win!  I mean, just yes, yes, go here and indulge! All of the Pancakes were amazeballs and the Breakfast Sandwiches were made with such fresh tasty ingredients and they weren't greasy or sloppy like a lot of Breakfast Sandwiches. I also really enjoyed the Hash Browns, crispy and also not greasy so yay.   It's pretty cute in here, the service was great, food came out at a reasonable pace and it was clean. If you're trying to eat healthy, although this place tastes like it uses fresh ingredients, their offerings aren't too healthy; and really you have to come here for the unhealthy tasting goodness anyway.  Oh and P.S Houstonians who see this review, there are plans to open one here soon!

I only ordered a beer here, I had the Four Peaks Peach Ale. It was refreshing, just what I needed after a long day of traveling with more traveling chaos to come.   The service was great, fast and friendly. Most awesomely, it wasn't a rip off as is usual with anything at an airport. I believe it was $4 for a beer, I was very pleased.   I noticed a few of the food offerings, they all sounded good, and they were priced reasonably.   My only complaint was that I was in the C gates and this place is in A...that may mean nothing to you but trust me it's a flippin' far walk. Sure, it was worth it for the beer, mostly. However, it's possible I almost missed my flight, ok yes, I almost missed my flight cause I underestimated the far walk back to my gate. Again, I needed beer, it was worth walking past all the glaring faces to the back on the plane.

I don't like to complicate breakfast. I usually find eating 1000 calories worth of pancakes as my first meal is a waste, and a poor way to start the day.   Snooze is the first and only place I will willingly and excitingly indulge in copious amounts of breakfast foods!  The last time I ventured here I tried the pancake of the day, it was a Blue Corn Batter with a Basil Mascarpone Cream and some sort of infused Syrup. It sounded weird. It was awesome!   If you're interested in taking your breakfast to the next level, I definitely recommend this place!
