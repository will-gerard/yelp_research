Mediocre food and mediocre service for the prices- nothing too special to make me want to come back. Should've went with my instinct and just gone to sweet tomatoes next door..

My son had his first initial appointment today & we had such an amazing experience that I have not even left the office yet and just had to write that i highly recommend Jungle Roots to anyone who has children who fear the dentist.. My son was one of them & had such a great experience that he is anxious to come back for his next check up!!! Two thumbs up!!

Horrible wait times! Went last night for a quick meal for the family & was in line 40+ mins.. I could've just got out of line and went elsewhere but I was trapped by the car in front of me and car behind me- just horrible definitely won't go back..

This place is the absolute worst at customer service & speed. It never fails at every location I go to I always have to wait so long- this baseline location being the worst!!! Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought drive thru was suppose to be a bit quicker than walking into the store?? Smh just horrible...

I've been meaning to post this review for so long now lol went and got my nose pierced a little over a month ago. The atmosphere is nice the staff was even nicer! Very knowledgeable and very informative on piercing aftercare! Def plan on going back in the future. It also helps that the place is literally 10 min away from me!!

I rarely go to this super close to home Starbucks because of how slow their service is- not to mention their mediocre customer service. I'm running late this morning as it is and decide to stop for a passion tea (since I'm late already anyway) I get there & opt out of going through drive thru because the line is ridiculously long, so instead I get out and walk inside. When I get in, there are TWO customers ahead of me the lady ordering is ordering at least 10 drinks and the cashier looked extremely irritated. So me and the guy in front of me are waiting a total 10 minutes before they decide to get another cashier to help us along with the other 6 people that walked in after us. Anyways paid for my drink and waited for my drink- the barista who gave me my drink didn't look at all happy to be working. I asked her for water with ice along with my tea, she let out a huge sigh and asked another barista to give me my water... I was reminded EXACTLY why I do not ever go to this Starbucks - this is by far my least favorite Starbucks thus far...

Very pleased with the office- I liked being able to schedule, reschedule or cancel appointments online . I also really like Dr Patel- he was very thorough and very pleasant!! I really have no complaints other than some assistants seeming to not really want to be there, but then again I was there late in the day so it could've been they just wanted to go home already.. Lol I've been there before so I could totally see that being one of those days for them.. Other than that I enjoyed my experience!!

Absolutely love this salon and the girls! Recently had my hair cut and styled by Stephanie- she is amazing!! I have known Stephanie for some time but this would be the first time she has cut my hair and I absolutely trusted her. I went in super nervous being that I was cutting off 11in. They definitely made me feel comfortable especially Hilda the owner. The way she spoke to her employees was more of that as friend an equal and not so much as a BOSS.. The only complaint I would have is that the facility is soo far from me, but totally worth the drive!! Def recommend anyone who's looking for a great atmosphere and talented hairdressers to go to Pluma!!!

I absolutely love this place they do an amazing job. I've gotten the same lady every single time and she is a very pleasant woman. One time her credit card machine was not working and I rarely carry cash on me and she was willing to let me go & just pay the next time i come in.. I was blown away that she would trust me to even come back and pay my next time around.. I went & took cash out of the ATM returned to pay her. I love that this place is on the south side & exceeds my expectations!! Def my to go to threading place!!

I seriously don't see how this place has received such high ratings...Food was not at all what I was expecting. Husband got the po' boys half w/ gumbo which of course I picked at..not impressed. I had the clam and alligator basket which was overly fried to the max I was munching on basically crisps of what I hoped were the clams. I was expecting maybe Cajun fries? I mean being a Cajun restaurant would seem fitting right? Nope! Regular fat burger fries. We primarily came because we seen the very high reviews everyone gave the establishment for their food. The atmosphere was nice though and the music was good. Staff service was ehhh our server looked bored and he did the bare minimum as our server. I'd probably not come back...

Absolutely love fired pie. It has the same Concept as subway or chipotle where you can choose toppings & sauces!! Out of all the locations I've been to Ray Rd location is my fave. I think just because of the location- totally recommend this place.. Oh also recommend cilantro on your pizza which is put on at the end after your pizza has cooked which is the best!! Mmm!!

I usually love Barros but this location is horrible! Staff are a bunch of either HS or just out of HS girls. We dined in and these girls were literally joking and screaming right next to our table. Our order came out at different times and didn't even get out salad. The food was ehh not worth was we paid. I gave 1 star because of the staff mainly and the cleanliness of the facility. Won't be coming back even though it is literally 5 mins from my house.. Super disappointed!!!!!
