I wish I would have did my research before I went on the with Sunshine Residential Homes. I interviewed with Simon as well and my interview lasted about 3 minutes. Where he asked me a series of questions like "do you have a felony" "do you have a drivers licenses ". He the went on to ask me what experience I have working with children. His demeanor was rude cold and short. I drove 45 minutes to be told that this was a pre-interview and I would be called back on Wednesday.   I then told him I was contacted via email that this was to be a full interview. He said he wanted to interview more qualified candidates. I said can you explain. He said well you only have a bachelors a lot of ppl here have maters. This pissed me off, I have a Juris Doctorate. Clearly written on my application and resume. I then told him and he chuckled and said "why you not go to law firm then" . I felt like asking him if he typically called ppl for interviews and doesn't read there fucking resume !!  Once I left I called back revoked my application and requested that my information be shredded.   The women at the front were both cold and rude. If there was a no star option I would give it!    DONT GO ON INTERVIEW!
