Found a cute pair of red Cowboys boots! The saleswomen was wonderful!! When I went to check out I noticed a splotch on the top of the boot.  I was a little disappointed since there wasn't another pair like itI asked if there was anything they could do about that. The guy was annoyed that I even would ask. He took it to the gentleman next to him. The second gentleman sighed so heavily, I was extremely uncomfortable. But, after much consultation, they decided on 20% off. Well, that was nice. Great. I can live with that splotch. Then, all of a sudden, he takes out a big permanent black marker and puts a Hugh KD on the inside!!! I was told it was so I couldn't return them and try to get a full refund. Okay, I understand that. But, Isn't there a way they can determine that without writing in the boot!!??? I would be humiliated to take off my boots and have someone see a HUGH KD on the inside.   I was soooooo bummed!!! I just walked out.

OMG! The sweet potato tots are to die for! I will be back for them! The Cajun Ahi Tuna Salad was also wonderful.  But, like other comments I've read.... The service was less than adequate.  All she did was take the order and disappear.  When she dropped the check it took her at least 10 minutes before picking it up. And, yes the card was sticking out of the presenter.

Great, friendly place that is sure to make you happy with whatever service you receive. They are great at their nail art and being sure that my sculpt nails  are thin and natural looking. The price for a sculpture nail fill with design and a basic pedicure was 43.00 when paying cash. They give cash discounts.  Check them out. I think you'll be happy.

VIP Adjust saved what could have been a bed ridden weekend getaway to Las Vegas. I was in extreme neck pain with a debilitating headache. Dr. Dembicer came to me within an hour, listened tentatively to what my neck problem was and relieved the pressure immediately! He adjusted my first rib nods. I have been to MANY chiropractors. But never has one done the amazing techniques that he performed. Within an hour after his adjustment I was at the pool enjoying my day. By night time I was able to enjoy a Vegas show. I would highly recommend VIP ADJUST.  He was a true blessing.

AMAZING!!!! Stopped by for a bite before the movie. Was beyond impressed.! Started with a cucumber Martini....... Yummy.  Since we were here at Decompression time most drinks and all apps were half price! The shrimp with grit corn cakes were as good as in Charleston,  S.C.  The fried green tomatoes were perfectly cooked and firm nice slices . The last thing and my favorite was the Blue Cheese hush puppies!! To die for!!! Jodi is fantastic behind the bar!!!! A perfect place before or after a movie or ANYTIME!!!

Pretty lame cranberry salad. Had to tell them goat cheese was suppose to be on it. For $10.00, it's not worth it. A few cranberries and a few red onions on top of spinach. Oh , and then they brought out about a tablespoon of goat cheese after I told them it was suppose to be on there!  Hopefully their beer is better . I don't drink beer but, the lemon martini was good!
