Whether it's for ladies day pampering, a bridal party, fun times with the hubby, or a date with daughter this place is at the top of my list.  This is a FIVE star nails salon for sure.  They do an exceptional job EVERY time.  My personal favorite is Molly. She takes her time and always exceeds my expectation.  Ben is also a fave of mine. He is nice with the designs. Everyone there is accommodating, kind, and respectful of boundaries.  Needless to say I REALLY love this place!!!!! Everyone should give it a try.

This place is perfect!!! Very kind and courteous staff and it is very clean.  Not only do they provide prompt and excellent customer service, the are very helpful in explaining the different dishes and comparing them to something similar.  Their Szechwan Shrimp and Sesame beef are to die for!!! I'd recommend this place to anyone coming over to Avondale for a visit!

Whether you were going here for a dinner with your family or for a night on the town, especially on Thursday or Saturday night, this is a cool place to come kick back and enjoy yourself. The food is amazing and the staff is nice.

Each time I come here I receive exceptional service from both front and back office staff, but particularly from front office MA Clayton.

I have been going to the head doc Dr. Tehranchi since for over 10 years before this practice was open.  I have been through the location and staff changes with him and he provides excellent care.  He has delivered both of my children and both deliveries went well.  HOWEVER, there is a HUGE issue with his staff coordination and management over the past couple of years.  The decline in good phone service and problem resolution by the staff has been a big problem.  Due to this issue this office has lost 2 of my cousins, my mother and my best friend (all of which I referred). I tried to hang in there, but at this point they have also lost me.   For three months now I have requested my records and none have been sent. I have also requested prescription refills for the past 2 months and have received no call back until requesting to speak with the office manager today, who tells me that I now need an appointment before they will refill anything and that she can't do anything about the office's negligence to handle this situation in advance when I initially called. She also tells me that my chart shows no record of being spoken with and no messages for my calls either. Not only is that a problem with me, but violates some federal rules as far as charting goes and negates some of Medicare's "meaningful use" purposes.    Despite the way it looks, this office has defiantly gone from A+ to D- in the matter of 2 years time.  Sad thing is this isn't the only story I have over this short time-frame.  If customer service, speedy response, order and managerial support are important you for your patient care DON'T GO TO THIS OFFICE.

As always the ice cream at Cold Stone is great, BUT the staff here sucks.  I was greeted by a young girl named Rachel who had much attitude and did not ring me up correctly.  She then proceeded to ask for more money as she stated she did not hear my original request correctly.  I explained to her that I had repeated my self to both her and another employee and that they would have to figure it out.  My friend I was with agreed to go to the car and get her money to pay the remaining $1.08 and Rachel proceeded to say that one of us had to stay behind until it was paid.  Not only was it very assumptive of her that we would Leave and not pay, but her aggressive tone was also not acceptable. Further, when asked for the phone number and contact for her management I was told to look it up.  Needless to say I will not be re-visiting this store again in the future.

I ordered food from here the other day. I was so excited to have my long waited for Chicken Red Curry. Unfortunately, not only was it the wrong size, it was not "Thai Spicy" as I requested, and it was missing the red in the sauce- looked like pure white curry. When I called to discuss this with the manager I was put on hold for 14 minutes and then hung up on.  When I called back no one answered. I will never go to this restaurant and I DO NOT recommend it!

Always clean and always friendly. The staff that there, no matter who it is, is constantly making sure that the facilities are clean and always available to help.  They are real good at tagging  if a machine goes down so that people don't lose their money.  I've never had an issue here

This place was great! Awesome food, great courteous customer service and obvious good management. Not only was everybody kind but very accommodating here. My favorite was the Doro Wat and the coffee is to die for. I would recommend anybody go here, they are not stingy with the portions, so make sure to take your appetite.
