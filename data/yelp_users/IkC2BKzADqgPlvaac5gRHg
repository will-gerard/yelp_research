The BEST pizza. Pizza that while eating makes you feel like you're in another country. The first bite was absurdly amazing...I wasn't expecting my taste buds to explode with delight. And the rest of the bites until the pizza was done were equally happy. The flavor of the pizza is completely different than any of our chains and independent pizza places (whose pizza I also love...this pizza is just different). I would recommend getting the pizzas with their sauce because some of the pizzas on the menu don't come with sauce and their sauce is probably what makes the pizza so good. I mean, the crust is special and the topping ingredients are fresher & a better quality than other pizza places...but the sauce has all the flavor.   The other food we had was good, but it pales in comparison. I had the mistacanza (spelling i'm not so sure on) salad, which was just ok (I would skip it next time). My boyfriend ordered one of the paninis which was pretty large & had a lot of meat and cheese, but I doubt it was nearly as good as the pizza (the pizza was finished, half the panini went home). The menu had a lot of homemade pastas, which we didn't try but are probably great. The other standout part of our meal was the complimentary bread & olive oil served at the start...the olive oil was fantastic tasting, much better than any other restaurant I've been to in the past few years and one of the breads (it was buttery & had coarse salt on the top) was delicious.   The only warning I have is they are quite finicky about changing their dishes. The bottom of the menu does say "please no substitutions" but they really mean it...as in we asked to have sauce added to our pizza (an easy & normal request at most places) and the waitress actually had to go ask the chef if it would be ok because they reallllly don't like to change their dishes. So if you have kids or picky eaters with you, beware that you might not get your way.

Ugh - stopped in here before a Diamonbacks game and quickly left after a beer. It's tiny, cramped (but not in a fun, packed house kind of way), and so very dark. It was kind of a mood killer. They do have a patio but didn't have the misters on and weren't serving out there. With all the beautiful weather we get in Arizona, I hate being cooped up in dark small places.

Coach & Willies is a nicer sports bar with an awesome food menu & is walking distance from Chase Field (really walking distance, as in we managed to walk in 105 degree weather).  The menu is a lot better than most bars & the atmosphere is nicer than most sports bars (aka you can take your parents or kids here & use the bathrooms without being grossed out). I personally really like this place because it's nice to be able to get a real & good meal at a sports bar. We've had:  - Italian Nachos:absolute GENIUS and I can't believe I've never thought of them to make on my own or seen on another menu. This is a must get dish, whether you get the full size as a meal or the half size as an appetizer. It's fried pizza dough that's still soft but firm enough to hold up the toppings, covered in delicious, flavorful marinara sauce topped with gobs of melted mozzarella and pizza toppings. My boyfriend & I are stuck on getting this dish every time. - Baked Mac & Cheese: Amazing! The cheese sauce is decadent, thick, creamy, and has a wonderful garlic & southwestern spice flavor.  - Italian Chopped Salad: Okay. The toppings didn't really taste like anything so overall it was an expensive bed of lettuce. - House Salad: Basic but a good choice to balance out one of the heavier meal options.

Awesomest mexican grocery store ever! This place is huge, clean, well kept, stocked with all sorts of awesome products, super low prices, and the friendliest people. I hate getting in the car for anything, and Phoenix Ranch Market is worth the 30 mile drive. I knew I was in for a treat just after getting out of the car - mexican party music piped into the parking lot & super bright displays visible through the doors. My boyfriend & I went up and down every aisle grabbing fun products to make awesome meals at home - masa, cast iron tortilla press, various mexican cheeses like asadero & oaxaca, fresh chips, fresh butter tortillas, real sugar pepsi & coke bottles, dried chillies, dried herbs (mexican oregano & cinnamon), nectars & coconut water to use as margarita mixers, etc. There is an entire cheese deli devoted to various kinds of cotija cheese (there had to be at least 10 different kinds). You can buy every kind of fresh tortilla your mind can think of, even whole wheat. There is a fresh fruit & salsa bar where you can buy stuff priced insanely low by the pound ($1.50/pound of fresh fruit?unreal!). There is an agua fruit bar with 10 different kinds - the coconut is to die for (and makes awesome margaritas!).   I love this place.

Fantastic place to bring a date or out-of-towners to experience the beauty of the desert landscape. It does get quite hot and there is little shade so I recommend wearing a hat and sunblock. I've been here a few times, and it's a 2 to 3 hour outing to explore max. The Chihuly exhibit is very cool and definitely worth checking out, though  the garden was the most crowded I've ever experienced when we went even though they sell a limited number of tickets for specific time slots. The local libraries offer "culture passes" where you can get free admission to the garden, and AAA membership gives you a 20% discount.

My problem with Coup Des Tartes really is that the food is horribly overpriced...not moderately overpriced makes you feel like you're eating at a fancy place, but outrageously overpriced for the quality of the food. For their price points, the food should be a lot better and the tables shouldn't be so close to each other. Their food reminded me of the kind of food I can get from the Whole Foods deli. After Valentine's Day here, I felt taken advantage of by the restaurant. $100 PER PERSON for a measly set of 4 courses with the awful offering of cliched mushroom risotto as the sole vegetarian option, with no choice of anything else. Had the menu been priced at around $40 a person, I still think this place would still only be a 3 star quality but at least reasonably priced.   - Brie Brulee: A name far more interesting than the dish itself. It's a warm slice of brie served with stale/boring crusty bread and fruit. There was the tiniest bit of fruit compote served with it, so at least someone in the kitchen did something that required effort with this otherwise simple dish.  - Onion Tarte: Probably the tastiest thing all night, but again, not worth the money. It has a very strong caramelized onion taste with a nice flaky crust. - Salad: Greens, fruit, nuts, and too much dressing. It was fine but not worth $25. - Chestnut Soup: Didn't taste a thing like chestnuts. The taste is actually like an Indian lentil soup called Sambar.  - Filet Mignon: My boyfriend seemed to like it. The mashed potatoes it was served with were very good. The other accompaniment were sugar snap peas drowning in butter/oil. - Lamb Shank: The couscous & veggies served with the lamb were very boring tasting, like no one even took the time to season them. - Cherry Tart: This was yummy, and fortunately didn't taste much like cherry. The shortbread crust was good and the combination of warm pie with cold ice cream is classic. - Chocolate Ganache Tart: Pretty good. It, of course, tasted like chocolate. Nothing really remarkable.  I'm confused why everyone calls this place charming. It is not charming to be a foot away from the tables next to you. It is not charming to hear their conversation like you're having it with them, struggle to push out your chair to get up because there is another chair right behind you, and struggle to squeeze yourself between tables to leave. I cannot recommend Coup Des Tartes to anyone. The restaurant left a very bad taste in my mouth, figuratively. With so many other nice, moderately overpriced restaurants with much better food, I don't know why anyone would come here.

Great place for a work lunch! There weren't a ton of vegetarian options but the ones I tried (appetizer and entree) were both excellent and I'd happily eat again. Like many other Yelpers recommend, the crispy eggplant appetizer is really really good. Perfect balance of textures and a really great combination of flavors. I also had the season vegetable plate which contained a variety of roasted vegetables like cauliflower, carrot, and potatoe served with a lemony aioli which was perfect and spring-like. On another visit I got the crispy eggplant sandwich, which is like the appetizer but super sized and served between two delicious brioche buns. Both entrees are fantastic! Service was great and the space is nicely lit with a lot of natural light. It's just a little bit on the pricey side.

Definitely a cool place for food & drinks. I got there at 11:30 am on Friday for a business lunch to find it pretty empty and quiet, and by 12:30 the place was packed and loud. Great indoor/outdoor spot with a variety of seating options (high top, bar, couches, regular tables, etc). The menu isn't giant but there are a lot of good things on it. The mixed salad is out of this world awesome - the crispy fennel, gorgonzola, and sweet nuts really is something else. The focaccia bread on the sandwiches is bomb. I had the only vegetarian sandwich option and it was pretty basic. I do wish they had a second vegetarian option that was a little more exciting than hummus/cukes/tomatoes.

Great place to grab lunch. The portions are large, the food is fresh, and the prices are reasonable. The greek salad comes loaded with toppings and all the ingredients were fresh. Topping-wise, there was enough for two salads. I found the banana peppers (or peppercini, not sure) to be a little too astringent from the pickling juice stuff so if you are sensitive to that taste, order them on the side. The pizza is good as well - big slices, nice thin crust, flavorful sauce, and lots of gooey cheese.

Awesome place to hike, spend a day, and camp out. The views and scenery really is spectacular and it's far enough away from the city so you can feel out in nature (but not too far if you need to grab a bite to eat or more firewood). The park offers a nice variety of trails from easy to moderate to difficult. I will happily be bringing friends and family here.  My boyfriend I did the Siphon Draw and attempted getting to Flatiron (didn't quite make it). The trail really is unmarked as you get close to Flatiron and is very rocky. Many people were on their hands, knees, butts (me included) and I saw at least a few experienced looking people with gloves on to protect their hands. It's a lot of fun and I recommend going as far as you feel comfortable. We passed a lady hugging the rock face for her life and stuck because she was afraid of heights (try not to put yourself in that position!).  We've also camped here and that was fantastic! You get a glorious view of the mountains with every camp spot and there are bathrooms & showers available. The spots are close to each other so it's not "remote" camping, but still very wonderful.

Such a darling place to come out for u-pick peaches and other organic veggies like kale and artichokes. It's not the greatest place for a picnic (they have a sign specifically saying no outside food or drink), but overall it's a very fun place to come with your family & kids to enjoy a little farm life. Queen Creek Olive Mill is just a few minutes away so you can take a picnic there (and the Mill has more food available).

I'm a little surprised on all the very positive reviews for Gyro's Express. I would give it about a 2.5 based on the quality of food, portion size, & cost. I ordered the greek salad with falafal ($10) and my boyfriend ordered a gyro lunch special ($10). The falafal balls were simply not good. They were dry & dense and lacked the crispy on the outside/soft on the inside freshness of good falafal balls. The salad itself was really small - I expect a larger portion size for a $10 salad. I will say the feta on top of the salad was quite good but there were only 3 small slices. My boyfriend thought his gyro was average and that the greek place down the street (taste of greek) made a better one. The french fries were good, but that is not so hard to do. All the seating is indoors which really is a shame in a place with good weather. Overall, I wouldn't come back here to eat again because there are lots of other choices nearby.

Really yummy food in large quantities at a great price. The ingredients are fresh, the salad portions are substantial, there are tons of different menu options, and the food is tasty...hard to beat that for a lunch break from work or dinner with the family. The bread bowl pasta (pesto penne) is genius. The Oregano's Favorite salad is amazing and very substantial. It's full of fresh vegetables, tons of cheese, and wonderful toasted pine nuts. I could eat this salad over and over, and the portion size is big enough to make it an actual meal

Streets of New York is an awesome place for lunch (and I would guess it's also great for dinner but more pricey). They have great lunch specials, yummy satisfying food, and quick friendly service.   - Pizza: Very satisfying. The crust is thicker than normal new york style pizza (which I like because it makes it more substantial) yet it's still nice and light. I guess I woudn't technically call it "New York" style pizza BUT it is really good pizza regardless. The sauce is flavorful and well balanced and there's lost of cheese that doesn't slip and slide all over like most new york style slices.  - Salads: Great! Usually pizza places have lame salads, but Streets of New York has fresh ingredients and a lot of different salad options (like pear blue cheese, spinach, greek, cobb, etc.). The dinner size is sizable enough for an entree (if you can sneak some bites of someone else's hot food to round it out).

I cannot believe this place is an actual Marriott property and not a Courtyard or Springhill Suites, which is the designation I think it truly deserves. The pictures on Marriott's website are particularly deceptive for this hotel. The quality of accommodation, service level & amenities is sub par.  The hotel itself is an okay property. The lobby is nice & the rooms are acceptable however the pool area is small and sparse and the room windows are not nearly thick enough. The hotel is unfortunately located next to the airport so all day long there is the sound of airplanes and they cheaply did not use the right thickness of windows to block the noise. The service I received was disappointing, and as a Platinum Marriott member I have come to expect more. The lady who checked us in was curt and barely looked at us while checking in. She tried to put us in a room that was less nice than what I had reserved and paid for, and I had to ask for room upgrades (none available...first time that's ever happened to me) & my complimentary breakfast (no concierge lounge on the property) - basically she was not going to offer to me what I deserved. In general the people working at the restaurant were unfriendly.  The place is overpriced for what it is.   Also whoever designed the hotel did a poor job of situating the rooms & hotel areas to take in the great beauty of the surroundings. Thirty seconds in a car away from the hotel & it's gorgeous, but none of that can really be seen or appreciated from the hotel which is a shame. I will never return to this property and would rather stay at a different hotel in the same area.

I've gotten two haircuts from Jen Boto, and I think I've finally found my hair cut place! Jen gets what I want really easily (long layers with face framing) and is very efficient (shampooed, cut, and styled in 30 minutes). The salon has a nice atmosphere and they use great products.

KO's is a great place for lunch during the work week! You get to be in a bar in the middle of the day (which is great), the place isn't crowded and service is prompt, and there are a lot of healthy options on the menu.   All of the salads are great. They are big and they are full of fresh vegetables & good lettuce. I particularly like the southwestern salad and would recommend it to anyone as a satisfying lunch. It's full of cheese and tortillas strips which makes every bite taste yummy without making the salad heavy. I never eat dressing on my salads however the chipotle aioli type dressing that came with the southwestern salad was amazing and worth all the calories.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is cause there were random chunks of chicken in what was supposed to be a vegetarian salad. Otherwise the service was good and we weren't interrupted unnecessarily, which seems to happen a lot in Arizona when I go to work lunches.

My boyfriend & I went to Four Peaks to watch some football (unfortunately our teams are not local and aren't shown on normal channels). Four Peaks has a decent number of TV's, a good amount of seating, good beer of course, and a large menu with enough variety for everyone. The place was packed with people who were there to just eat lunch, which is a good sign for a brewpub. The service was okay...our waitress seemed pretty dumb as in it took 30 minutes and 3 reminders to get a cup of coffee and then for the next 3 hours she stopped by every 5ish minutes to ask if we were doing okay while we were talking to each other or staring intently at our game (too often of an interruption...it was annoying). We ate:   - Nachos: Whoa I've never gotten nachos from a bar with so much cheese! They definitely don't skip - there had to be 1/4 inch of cheese covering each chip (yum). I didn't really like that the nacho toppings were served separately on the side which meant a lot of dipping & paying attention to the food instead of the game.  - Garden burger: I love that they have real veggie burgers but mine was very soggy & undercooked. The bun it came on was amazing, super thick and bready and delicious. The creamy sauce, cheese, & toppings were heavy but perfect for drinking food.  - French Dip Sandwich: My boyfriend got this and thought it was fine but nothing too special.  - Beer Battered Fries: Yum. I was hoping they would a little more battered & thick, but instead it was a very light crunchiness on the outside of the fry. Still a very grubbing snack.   I'm sure we'll be going back to Four Peaks for more football games. It also would be a good place to bring a visiting friend from out of town so they can sample some good local beer.

Hot air ballooning is such a wonderful experience! My boyfriend & I went on the sunrise ride, and it was so lovely. I have a terrible fear of heights (I can't stand next to the railing on a high building) but for some reason being in a hot air balloon high above the ground feels more like floating on a cloud then the dizzying effect I feel normally. Our captain was knowledgeable & excited. It's hard to knock an experience like hot air ballooning. My only two complaints about an otherwise insanely awesome time is that they make you meet them and then drive around to find the right launch site, instead of them doing that beforehand and saving their paying customers some sleep time (4:30 am is early!). I noticed that the other companies that launched from the same site as us had a truck go ahead with all the stuff and then the people were brought later. Also I wish that we had gone higher in the sky instead of staying close to the ground since we were flying over a lot of suburbs (I don't particularly care to see people in their backyards). After we touched down we had a very nice champagne toast (mimosas at 7 am are particularly refreshing in the desert).   A lovely time, I highly recommend it to everyone!

My boyfriend & I went on a 2 hour horseback ride with Cave Creek Outfitters and had a really great time. I would highly recommend this to families & couples as a fun outing to do together. I've done similar horseback riding in California & Oregon, and this one was my favorite. The horses were nice, the trail leader was nice, the group was small, and the scenery is incredibly beautiful. Part of the ride was close to houses (not so fun) but a good portion of it felt like we were just out in the wild west surrounded by big rock formations and tons of cactus. Be sure to wear pants & real shoes because the trail is narrow in a lot of parts and you will brush up against prickly plants, and shoes so you can guide your horse. Also be sure to bring your camera because the trail leader will get off his horse and take some very cute pictures.

I had an assortment of pies from Honey Moon Sweets at a work event, and boy are they good! The Peanut Butter Pie is mind blowing! If you like (okay love, who just "likes" Reeses?) Reeses peanut butter cups, this is the pie for you. It's a huge amount of peanut butter filling that tastes like a fluffy version of the peanut butter filling (fluffy yet thick), in a crispy crust, topped with loads of whipped cream. Now it is missing the chocolate so I recommend adding a slice of the Chocolate Cream Pie to round it out, which is also delightful.   The pies are so pretty and so yummy. Highly recommend this bakery!

Macayo's has great food but a poor happy hour. I was expecting kind of mediocre food based on the fact that it's a chain, but I was quite impressed with how fresh and flavorful the food was. I got the taco salad which was a lot bigger and healthier than most other place's taco salad. My boyfriend got the enchilada sampler which was amazing! The sour cream like enchilada sauce is really unique and delicious.   The only negative thing were the happy hour margaritas. After 4 margaritas in about an hour (which normally would produce quite a nice buzz) all I had was a very full belly of liquid. I would recommend ordering regular drinks instead of the HH margaritas as a far more cost effective method of getting your tipsy on.

Cowtown Boots has the biggest and best selection of cowboy/girl/children boots I've seen yet. Came here on the recommendation of a lovely saleslady in Cave Creek (I balked at the $400 boots her store was selling) and am so glad! There are soooo many different kinds of boots in terms of brand, styles (pointy toe, round toe, square toe, snipped toe), shaft heights (short to tall), colors (pink to purple to blue to normal shades of brown and black), and prices (saw some pairs for as low as $80). The men's section is giant however the ladies' section is definitely better than what I've seen at stores in Cave Creek or Saba's.   The sales people were nice and left me alone when I needed (a lot of) time to make a decision but also were able to chime in with information on different brands & fit. The store also had a pretty large selection of straw cowboy hats & men's belts.  If you are looking for a pair of cowboy boots, this is definitely the store for you! I love the pair I got from here.

What a fun time! Beer is only $3-5 and there is jousting, enough said. It sure is a trek to get out here from Phoenix but it's worth it! I went with my husband and some friends and had a great time. I was very impressed by how beautifully decorated the fair is and all the workers are so in character. For adults, the primary draw is the jousting tournaments. The rest of the festival is a whole lot of stores and shows that seemed mostly aimed at entertaining children (great for families).   I was so impressed with the food selections available. There are tons of vegetarian options, the food is good, mostly is made fresh, and it's not expensive at all. I was expecting stadium prices, and would have paid stadium prices, so to see everything at half the cost of that was a refreshing surprise. I got a Taco Salad with black beans ($5) and while it really was nachos, not a salad, it was yummy. The Roasted Vegetable Lasagna also looked like a great option.  One thing to note - I'd recommend avoiding riding the camels and elephants. I was waiting in line for the restroom adjacent to their area and heard animals making frightful noises and a lot of people screaming. One of the camels had gotten freaked out and was trying to toss/smash its human riders. Things did not seem to end well for the elderly couple that was on the camel. It doesn't seem like the animals are treated that well and are enclosed in a small space.  Also, wear sunblock! The weather forecast said it would only be a high of 70 so we didn't bother, but it felt like 80+ and we all got significantly tanned or sunburnt. Somehow the fair is just hotter than everywhere else around Apache Junction.

Julio's Too is a great place to get your tex-mex fix quickly & satisfactorily. The menu is really big and there are a lot of vegetarian options. I give them a high rating because the veggie taco salad has to be one of the best I've ever had, and I've eaten a ton of taco salads. They put real romaine lettuce in it, a ton of freshly sauteed veggies, a light sprinkling of cheese, good black beans, and a nice healthy dollop of fresh & good guacamole. I also had a green corn tamale which was alright, but the sauce (which you have to pay extra for but is totally worth it) is amazing - it's flavorful, thick, comforting. The tamale itself seemed a little dry, mushy, and bland to me. I didn't really like the free chips (too thin) & their free salsa (boring flavor) didn't impress me much.

The rumors don't lie - come to Roaring Fork and get the Green Chili Mac & Cheese. You can't make mac & cheese like this at home (yes I have spent the last hour googling for it and by all accounts, every food blogger fails to replicate it at home). The sauce is perfectly velvety smooth with a bright spicy flavor (and bright green color) and a lovely crunchy breadcrumb topping. It is perfection and it's served in the cutest little skillet. Everything else we had wasn't as good, but still worth mentioning. For vegetarians (like me) you can pick an assortment of sides and they'll serve it all together on a plate with some stuff mixed into hollowed out tomatoes.  - Mexican Street Corn: I was expecting corn on the cob on a stick covered in mayo and cheese, but was pleasantly surprised to receive a very flavorful corn off the cob. The corn was fire roasted and mixed with yummy cilantro and garlic. It was quite delicious and I would recommend this side dish to anyone. - Black Bean Puree: Awesome. They used cumin quite liberally in this dish so it was very flavorful. Even my boyfriend, who up until this meal claimed to dislike beans, liked it. - Green Chili Mac & Cheese: See introduction. You must get this dish! - Roasted Vegetables: A misnomer. They were steamed/sauteed vegetables and were fine. I was expecting a deep roasted flavor so it was a little disappointing to just get steamed squash, but that's okay. - Fish Tacos: My boyfriend's mom got these and liked them a lot. She said the dish was very fresh and the pesto sauce was a unique and yummy addition to regular fish tacos. - Fried Chicken: My boyfriend ordered this and liked it, His mashed potatoes were delicious. - Huckleberry Margarita: A fun concept. It's a regular frozen margarita with a jam-like puree of huckleberry that you mix together. I liked them a lot but perhaps ordered too many because I felt a little hungover later. - Huckleberry Bread Pudding: Amazing bread pudding! Roaring Fork probably uses some type of cake bread (maybe pound cake?) because the bread pudding was so soft and silky and tasted very strong of birthday cake (in the best possible way). The berry flavor wasn't really there but added a nice pop to a few bites. The vanilla ice cream served with it had a very strong french vanilla taste which went perfectly with the birthday cake-tasting bread pudding. Yummy!  I would highly recommend bringing out of towners here (it has a fun southwestern/cowboy vibe, fancied up) or coming on a date. The food is quite good and reasonably priced for a James Beard award winning chef.

Received great service from Mark, who went above and beyond. Friendly employees and they provide all the shipping & printing services you need. Location is a little hard to find in the shopping center - it is located on the north side of the strip mall, facing Osborn Rd.

Love Barro's pizza! Thick doughy crust, very flavorful sauce, and wonderfully large amounts of cheese. This is the kind of pizza you want to eat after work, on date night, late night munchies, hangover mornings, and football sundays. The pizza is great, there are some salad options, the cheesy bread is awesome! And the prices make it such a value without sacrificing quality.

My boyfriend & I went to Lon's for a romantic date night at sunset. He picked Lon's because there are many sources saying it's a great place to watch an Arizona sunset which we found out is simply not true but the food was delicious & the evening lovely.   - Sunset: Yes worthy of it's own review because this place is lauded as a top place to watch it. We were given the best table in the house for watching the sunset...but you can't see much of the sunset or mountains over all the brush and other stuff out there. We even went outside and wandered around the property at sunset to find a better vantage point, but no luck. I will give props to the great service at Lons - our server told us to just head out and he'd put our food orders in when we returned. - Stuffed Squash Blossoms: This was a special appetizer on their prix fixed menu, and it was amazing! Not only was there the squash blossom stuffed with delicious creamy warm cheese, but the entire stem was attached and fried as well. I've never had squash blossom stem and found it to be delightful, like a firmer zucchini. The salad underneath was dressed with a tangy creamy vinagrette that perfectly complemented the squash. So good! - Bread Platter: Complimentary and so good! Hands down our favorite was the cornbread - super buttery and moist with a kick of heat. Awesome. - Roasted Vegetable Quinoa Salad: A special not on the menu choice for vegetarians and I loved it. Earthy red quinoa mixed with perfectly roasted veggies drizzled with a grassy olive oil. - Pork: My boyfriend had this and enjoyed it. The creamed corn that came with the dish was delicious. - Truffled Papas Fritas: Awesome truffle fries. They used enough truffle oil so each bite really tastes like it.  - Prickly Pear Margarita: I'm calling this drink out because it was way too sweet and gave me a bit of an upset stomach. If you don't like sweet drinks, beware of this one.  I doubt that we'd return for another meal (if the sunsets were more spectacular than it would be worth the price) but it is a lovely date spot and is definitely worth going to at least once.

I came to Charleston's because of the big salads in their tv commercials. Boy was this a disappointment. The atmosphere is awful - really dark and heavy in the inside. The patio was closed, for no good reason. I should have known I was in for a bad meal based on the percentage of senior citizens dining...there wasn't a single person other than myself and my fiance under 50 dining there.    All the entree salads have meat in them. I asked for an entree-sized house salad, sub blue cheese for the bacon. Our server said "well the house salad isn't served in the big entree sized bowls, it's served in side-sized bowl, but it's the same amount of food". I, of course, gave her a surprised look and asked for clarification because that statement obviously doesn't sound correct. She repeated and said "trust me". Well my salad came out and it was a small handful of lettuce (for $6) and I was charged an additional $2 for a small amount of blue cheese, which she did not disclose when I ordered. Anyone over the age of 10 knows that you aren't going to get the same amount of food that comes in a giant bowl in a tiny bowl. I knew it didn't sound right but how can I argue with the server? So $8 for about 3 bites of mediocre food...should have gone a block down the street to Paradise Bakery for an $8 big salad.  Ugh, avoid this place.

I received great help from Kevin when trying to pick out a paint and paint tools for completing a built in. I knew from online research that Sherwin-Williams paint was a better quality than the stuff at our big box home improvement stores, but was pretty confused on exactly what kind of paint and what kind of sprayer I needed. There don't seem to be any Benjamin Moore stores around Phoenix. Ace Hardware was a little help but not as much as Sherwin-Williams. I must have gone in 5 different times, with different questions and changed directions on what I wanted to do, and each time Kevin was patient & helpful. Highly recommend this store for the DIY-ers who need help! There also were a lot of contractors who were in the store buying paint, which must be a good indication of their paint use.

Z'Tejas is a great restaurant with reliable food and service. I've come here for work lunches as well as dinner with friends, and haven't had a bad experience. There are a lot of choices for vegetarians, which is great. I really like the mushroom enchiladas, mac & cheese, and chopped salad. Their complimentary cornbread is awesome too!

Love this place! Flavorful & fresh food at a great price. The outdoor patio is really nice as well. I love the salads - they are giant, full of yummy mix ins, and clock in under $10. My favorite is the greek-style one, which they amp up with juicy sweet raisins which I initially thought sound really gross but in fact does work really well with the spicy feta and nutty roasted pine nuts. The lunch special of $3 for two really big slices of thin crust pizza is great too. The crust is really thin and perfect for folding, but thick enough to hold up a lot of cheese and a really good flavorful pizza sauce.   My only complain about Oregano's (all of them) is that the music is always way too loud. Like it's uncomfortable if you get the wrong seat under a speaker.

Fantastic location for a nice dinner and a great place to host an event. The food is awesome and the atmosphere of the restaurant is darling. It's a great place to bring out-of-towners for a good meal with some Southwest flair.  We had our wedding rehearsal dinner here and reserved the Cocktail Patio. Admittedly, it was hard at times working with John who is the group events coordinator. However, the extra time and patience does pay off because our rehearsal dinner was a very fun evening in a beautiful area reserved for just our party with great food. The service was just okay, we had much better service when dining normally at the restaurant...must be because of that automatic 22% event gratuity!   Some standout dishes:  - Three Sister's Salsa & Trio of Hummus: They both come with the same AMAZING fry bread that is a must. I personally thought the salsas were on the bland side and much preferred the trio of hummus, which were more like thick brushettas as opposed to traditional hummus. -  Entree Salads, especially the Harvest Salad: These are the biggest salads I've ever seen! The Harvest Salad is exceptionally - tons of macrona almonds, fresh fruit, delicious cheese...a really refreshing and filling salad. - Vegetarian Gemelli Pesto Pasta: Delicious vegetarian entree! There are a good amount of vegetables bathed in a wonderfully creamy pesto sauce. It's a very satisfying dish. - Ancho Chilli- Rubbed Filet: My husband loves this dish. He says the flavors are amazing and the meat is cooked perfectly. I can attest that the side dishes it comes with are delicious.

Love the food at Harold's, the large menu, the atmosphere, the great service, and the fact that it shares a parking lot with Buffalo Chip so it's easy to mosey on over for bull riding after a good dinner. Buffalo Chip has mediocre food, a tiny menu, and bad food service if you get there too late and it's super busy.  Harold's has a large dining area and a wonderfully large menu. While most of it looks vegetarian, I found out when researching rehearsal dinner places that many of the sauces have some kind of meat stock in them, making it unvegetarian. The server we had for dinner was really nice, prompt, and helpful. The menu has a ton of different choices like regular bar food, mexican food, tons of bbq, pizza, pastas, and burgers/sandwiches. The salads are fresh, the bbq sauce is amazing, and they serve warm, soft bread rolls with just about everything.  The inside has a charming western feel and doesn't get too crowded feeling even when there are a lot of people because the rooms are quite large. The patio is really nice with a ton of misters, a beautiful view of mountains & cactus, and is sunset-facing.   I definitely recommend getting dinner & drinks here and then heading over to the Buffalo Chip for Friday night bull riding.

One of the awesomest places I've been to yet in Arizona. This is a must for people visiting or newcomers, or it even would be a great place to do a company outing. The food is just okay, but everything else is awesome. Big mugs of beer are only $4 and there is bull riding and cowboy music. The place is totally themed out but I didn't think it was cheesy (or I really liked the cheese).   I wouldn't recommend coming here just for food. For vegetarians there is an all you can eat salad buffet. For meat eaters, there is an endless supply of food you can eat. The biscuits were way too heavy and hard and the cowboy beans are probably an after thought. Their chips and salsa are surprisingly good, and though we didn't order it because we were deep into beer there is a tableside s'mores where you get to roast your own s'mores over an small open flame.  Wear whatever cowboy gear you may have and just come for a good time!

Lake Pleasant is Phoenix's watery respite from the heat! This lake is BIG! There is something really special about seeing beautiful saguaro cactus and water in the same view. This is a great place to come for a picnic (lots of day use shaded structures with views), a hike, and sitting by the water.  I recommend researching ahead of time where you want to go and what you want to do. Unlike most regional parks in this area, there are multiple exits from the road and then once you're in the park, many different directions to go without a visitors center at the front to help guide you. We ended up going on the Road Runner hike, which was mostly along the water with lots of wild flowers in bloom. We also picnicked at the trail head. We did some driving around and found there were a lot more picnic spots closer to the water, with great views, if you head in the opposite direction of the Road Runner trail head (towards the visitor center, which is actually at the very end of the park). Next time we will take a different exit from the road and try kayaking or stand up paddle boarding at the marina.

While this is a cute hotel, my experience with reserving a block of rooms to support wedding guests has been ATROCIOUS and STRESSFUL and I would very much recommend against anyone doing a group event at this hotel that requires getting a discounted block of rooms for guests.  I signed a contract with the resort in June of 2012 for an April 2013 wedding. The hotel requires you to give them a deposit to guarantee that rooms in the block get booked, even though they release all those rooms 1 entire month before your event (so they keep your deposit even though those rooms likely will get booked). If the negatives had ended with a simple deposit, that would have been fine. However their online booking tool (with your discounted rate) does not work either, and it is a known bug that they know about but do not tell you when you sign a contract & give them a deposit. So if your guests want to book nights before and after your date (they are supposed to honor the discounted rate 3 nights pre and post), the guests have to call the hotel directly.  If the reservation staff that answered calls were competent, this wouldn't be such a negative review. However I had multiple guests over many occasions reach out to tell me that reservations told them there were no rooms left in the block (FALSE every time) and then reservations would quote my guests a much higher rate. After the first few times of this happening, I called the group rooms coordinator at the hotel (Cory) directly. She does not pick up the phone frequently and has yet to ever return a voicemail...I just have to keep calling back until she picks up. She assured me that if this happened again the future, I could tell me guests to call her directly. So I did this, and they had to leave voicemails for her because she didn't pick up, and then she never returned their phone calls!   I finally managed to get a hold of a higher level manager who promptly took care of my issues. However this was after months of headache and 80% of our guests had already booked (aka I had already gone through the pain of booking them). After my phone call with the manager, it was smooth sailing.  I can't fully put into words what a headache dealing with this hotel was. As a Cave Creek resident, I wanted to support a local business...in this case it was a huge mistake. The charm of this hotel does not beat the reliability and ease of a Marriott.

I'm not sure how this place has so many good reviews because it seems like the exact sort of place that would be on a TV restaurant fix show. The menu is really eclectic in a confusing sort of way. There is asian food, mexican food, cajun food, greek food, bbq, american, etc. The inside of the restaurant is unspectacular and had an awful odor when we visited. We sat outside in the patio area, which is definitely charming. The outside area is the only reason this place is 2 stars instead of 1.  Prices on the menu are high, for drinks and for food. This would be okay if the drinks and food were better. My $12ish margarita was pretty much all sweet & sour mix. The cheese enchiladas were average and I didn't care too much for the sauce (really spicy without much else flavor).   The outside area is really cute and adorable. If the drinks were cheaper it'd be a great spot to sit out & relax (and then eat food somewhere else).

Love this stadium! I've only been to stadiums along the west coast but out of all them, Chase Field is my favorite. The temperature is perfect, the seats are comfortable, parking is easy & inexpensive, and most importantly, the food options are way more varied than most stadiums. There's chinese, mexican, pizza, gluten free options, salad (whoa not normal stadium food), ice cream, dessert treats, and all the regular stadium food. Prices are pretty comparable to other stadiums, however there is a value menu that has $1.50 food options & $4 beers. The $4  beers are a ripoff though cause it's only 8 oz and a normal $9 draft beer is 24 oz...do the math.   There are a good number of sports bars that are walking distance from the stadium, and Sliders is right next to the stadium with a big outdoor beer garden.

Burger Bar is awesome for vegetarians. The vegetarian burger is the BEST veggie burger I've ever had in the 11 years I've been a vegetarian. Boca & Morningstar, you may call yourself a veggie burger but you're really just some soy slime with a faux funky meat taste. Gross.   The Burger Bar veggie patty is the real deal - thick, fresh, and deliciously full of vegetables. I was a little worried by the description (pumpkin puree? weird), but was so delighted by my first bite. It bursts with flavor. I would have been happy to make a meal solely from a few patties, nothing else, that's how good & satisfying this burger was. Also, the beer battered jalapeno pickles were bomb! Crunchy & fried on the outside, yummy on the inside.   There were some disappointments - the bun wasn't really all that great. The homemade dijon mustard (one of the extra costs) didn't taste as good as grey poupon off the shelf. The cheese was broiled too long on both mine & my boyfriend's burgers, so it was thin and hard instead of being thick & cheesy. Overall, the meal was awesome and I hope I can go back to try some of the desserts & milkshakes (alcoholic milkshakes! does it really get better than that?).

A tourist vegetarian's view on primanti's: Grubbing!   I had the egg & cheese sandwich with an iron city beer and enjoyed my entire experience (including the styrofoam cups, wax paper plates, and garbage behind my chair to throw it all away in).  The sandwich is big, messy to eat, full of different flavors, and even better with some red hot sauce.  Primanti's is open 24 hours, they have a TV with whatever game is on (yes I have noticed people in pittsburgh love their teams), and the food is fast, unpretentious, and satisfying (loads better than any other long hours-fast food-chain-type place).  I have to agree with what I was told...no trip to Pittsburgh is complete without a visit to Primanti's & some Iron City beer.

Love this place for work week lunches! Yummy food, large portions, ample seating in the middle of the day, and reasonable prices especially close to Old Town.  It's the salads that really make me love this place. They are giant, fresh, and full of good toppings. It's hard to find a salad that's big enough to fill me up until afternoon snack time, and Oregano's gets the job done every time. My favorites are the Oregano Favorite and the Picasso Mexico salad. The Veggie sandwich is average - the bread tasted a little funny to me, but the caramelized onions and portabella mushrooms were quite yummy. The big slice of pizza for only $2.99 is an awesome deal as well, and the pizza is great thin crust pizza.  This location has outdoor seating, semi-indoor/outdoor seating, true indoor booths, and bar seating so there is a lot to choose from. They are quick with service, even in the midday rush.  The only negative is that they place their music ungodly loudly. It can be hard to hear conversation at the same table and I find it irritates me. If they took it down a few notches, it would be perfect background music.

Los Sombreros serves the Mexican delicacy Huitlacoche (Corn Smut in English...I know which language I prefer) which is pretty cool and something everyone should get the chance to try. The place is really cute so a meal out on the patio feels a little like a short trip over the border. The menu doesn't have a lot of options for vegetarians (me) but I still really enjoyed my meal & would come back, that's how much I like this place. My boyfriend & I had:  - Queso Fundido with Rajas: Delicious - good real cheese mixed with a lot of peppers & onions. I liked that there was some salsa (or a lot of cooking liquid from the peppers) mixed in with the cheese so it was a lighter fundido than just full on cheese. - Guacamole: Love their guac. It's really chunky & really fresh. - Huitlacoche Crepas: Such an interesting dish & totally unlike what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The flavor of Huitlacoche is hard to describe - it's savory, a little like mushrooms, has a creamy texture. The flavor combination of the dish was very sweet & savory - savory huitlacoche with sweet pomegranate sauce and seeds with tart blue cheese, all wrapped in a soft crepe.  - Carnitas: My boyfriend ordered this and said the meat was really good. The serving size is enough for 2 meals. The corn tortillas that came with it were really good and fresh. The mexican rice and refried beans that came with it were probably not vegetarian and were just average.  I noticed in the kitchen they cook over a wood-burning stove, which seemed rather authentic and must make their food that much better. The bar is outside & looks like a beach bar, adding to the fun atmosphere.

A beautiful & fancy place for a nice dinner out in Las Vegas. I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we were lucky enough to get a table out on the patio. Getting to sit out there with the fountain show was lovely! It very much was a classy Vegas experience. The menu has a lot of good choices, including things for vegetarians.   I had the mushroom papardelle, which was quite delicious but a little too rich if you want to go out after dinner. The mushrooms were wonderful, the pasta noodles were so good, and the peas & pea shoots helped take some of the edge off the creaminess. The menu mentioned truffle essence but I didn't catch any of that. At $34 a plate, it's definitely a lot, but it was a very large portion and had I been going back to my room there would have been enough to put in a take away box for later. My husband had the ricotta & sausage ravioli, and devoured it.

If you are looking for a good workout that's more interesting than just running around a track, Camelback is a great option. If you are looking for a chance to get outside to experience Arizona's natural desert beauty then Camelback is a very poor choice. We did the Echo Canyon Summit trail and I really am surprised that people call the views amazing and breathtaking because the views are just urban sprawl & fencing. Yes, there is actually a large portion of the hike that is FENCED IN - I felt like I was in prison. The only 'breathtaking' part about it is the lethargy I feel when surrounded by ugly urban sprawl & large high rises & too much metal. Sure there is an expansive "view" from the top but the view is ugly buildings that were not built to blend in with the landscape. Also parking was impossible. There was actually a giant line of cars just parked & waiting in line for a parking spot in the tiny lot for much much longer than it would take to park somewhere else further and walk to the trailhead...which makes me think that at least some of the people coming here must not get outdoors very often.  Basically I was really disappointed by Camelback as an opportunity to get out in nature & enjoy the desert. I definitely would recommend against coming here for anything other than a quick workout.

I've only gone to the Capital Grille for work-sponsored lunches and dinners so it's easier for me to rank it higher since cost isn't really an issue. If I had to pay for it myself, it would end up as a more special occasion or i-need-a-pick-me-up-lunch type of place. I really like the Capital Grille because even though the focus is on higher end meat and seafood, the vegetarian options are particularly good which is hard to come by at most restaurants in the same category. The Cobb salad (you can get vegetarian) is great because it's big, filling, and fresh. The veggie plate you can special order is a perfect entree, and though it's basically just a combination of all the side veggie dishes I think the sum is definitely greater than the parts. There are buttery roasted mushrooms covered in garlic & rosemary & thyme, grilled asparagus, sauteed spinach, and roasted tomatoes that add a wonderful sweetness and acidity to the dish.

Chelsea's has really wonderful food in a nice upbeat atmosphere. The patio is really nice and so is the inside. Right upon walking in the place has an amazing smoky smell that is really pleasant and (at least for me) throws me into a relaxed/hanging out with my friends at a campfire sort of mood. The menu has a lot of options for everyone, including vegetarians. I had the vegetarian tacos and they were amazing! The portions are huge, and everything on the plate is perfectly flavored and tastes so good by itself and even better together. The guacamole is spot on fresh, the pico de gallo is bright & citrusy that perfectly balances out the garlic veggies, and the kale slaw is just awesome. Hard to describe the flavor other than hearty greens with sweet tomatoes and wonderfully nutty quinoa - it's totally healthy and good tasting. The tortillas that come with the dish are soft and fresh, though tiny. The whole plate is fantastic and I would happily eat many many meals of it. It is a little pricey at $15 but I do think it's worth every penny, and I had a little bit of leftovers to take for an afternoon snack.  This is a perfect go-to spot for workday lunches or lounging weekend meals. Highly recommend!

Bobby Q's catered our wedding and the food was absolutely awesome. I've also had their food at other catered events and it was equally awesome then, too. I've impressed that a BBQ-based company is so accommodating of vegetarian diets and that their vegetarian food is actually really good!  We had a Mexican meal catered for our wedding. Our guests raved about the meats and I really enjoyed the enchiladas and guacamole. The servers were good, the food was excellent, they went the extra effort to match their buffet display to our wedding colors, and the cost was far more reasonable than most wedding meals. If it hadn't been my wedding, I would have stuffed myself silly on the food it was so good.  I've also had the barbeque meal catering at a different event, and it was delicious! The servers were so accommodating as soon as they heard I was vegetarian (offering to grill up some other fare for me). The mac & cheese and biscuits were awesome.

Compared to Chase Field this stadium kinda sucks. Though I would much rather watch football than baseball, the food and drink options in the stadium and around the stadium are really sub par.   The bars & restaurants in the area right next to the stadium were clearly built only for stadium spectators (because there is nothing else around) but were not built to handle the capacity. We got there about 2.5 hours before the game and everything had insanely long lines and if there was any seating available without a 2 hour wait it was for outdoor-only seating (it was 110 degrees outside...painful). The Yard House (the best option there) was completely full with no chance of getting food or drinks before the game.   Inside the stadium the food choices are slim and not very good. I love a ballpark pretzel as much as the next person but they could have done better. The Papa Johns branded pizza was awful and didn't taste a think like Papa John's pizza - soggy crust, tasteless sauce, no herbs or flavoring, and barely any cheese.   The screens inside the stadium are pathetically small so I recommend not getting nosebleed seats because you won't have much to look at to see what happened. We had really good seats and the screens were too small to help much.

Yummy food, reasonable prices, nice atmosphere, and great service! I came here for dinner with a girlfriend and enjoyed my time and meal. I had the greek salad which was chock full of yummy fresh toppings, and was very enjoyable. I loved that they put raisins in it like Oregano's. Sounds so weird but is so yummy. My girlfriend has the daily special mac & cheese, which looked amazing. It came out bubbling and cheesy and she enjoyed it.

This is the good Spotted Donkey! We really liked other one before the ownership change, very much so disliked it after the ownership change, and are so happy to have found this one. The menu is full of great Tex Mex-with-a-fancy-twist-foods. Prices are a little higher than normal Mexican food however you actually get more quality and freshness for it. It's a great place to come for date night, a casual weeknight meal, or a family dinner.

Such yummy food but I definitely did not enjoy the interior dining experience. I will happily get my future food to go. Their british pub concept could be so cool, but instead it was really dark (blackout curtains on every window), way too loud (blaring music), and just overall way too hipster grunge for me (hello, Seattle). Dining experience aside, the menu is giant and the food is really good. I had: -  Greek Pasty: Vegetarian and I absolutely loved all the flavors in it. It was full of cheese, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, and olives all wrapped up in a warm buttery crust.  - House Salad: Really fresh (amazing tomatoes) and good-sized.  - Sticky Toffee Pudding: Having read about the dessert in English books, I've always wanted to try it. It was pretty good but probably not something I'd order again. After this dish and watching enough Downtown Abbey, I finally get that the English call their cakes "pudding". So it's not pudding at all, but a cake. There really wasn't enough of a toffee flavor, and instead most of the cake had a mild molasses flavor. Parts of the cake were really dry, so the vanilla ice cream its served with made it a lot better. This is certainly a fun dessert to try, but not totally my favorite.  I only ate half of my pasty at dinner, then ate the other half a few hours later in the comfort of my own home, and definitely enjoyed the leftover half in my home a whole lot more. So overall, I really recommend the food, just in a to-go form :)

If you're staying in the MGM or NYNY, this is THE place for a night time snack to make the next morning feel less bad. It's open till forever and the slices are thick, big, and the right amount of greasy. The piano bar is next door so you'll be treating to some live music with your slice. Yes it's $5 for a slice and you'll need two but it's small price to pay for convenience and feeling ok the next morning. The whole pie is a much better deal but if you can wait the 25 minutes, you probably don't need it and can get a more quality pie elsewhere :)

What a fantastic restaurant, especially during Restaurant Week! The food overall was really good and at a very good value on Restaurant Week prices. The outdoor patio is cute and there was a live jazz band when we visited on a Saturday evening. I had:  - Vegetarian Tostadas: Yum! The guacamole and chipotle aioli was quite delicious and nicely balanced the sweet cabbage - 12 Vegetable Enchiladas: Amazing! These have to be the best vegetarian enchiladas I've ever had - real vegetables with a lot of flavor instead of just cheese. - Bread Pudding: This was the only average food item we had all night. I just didn't love the combination of fruit and chocolate and cinnamon - personal flavor preference. - Jalapeno Creamed Corn: Oh my gosh delicious. Sweet & hot at the same time - I highly recommend this side dish. - Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes: Also really great - full of flavor and very satisfying.  The service we received while at Fuego Bistro was excellent. Our server was great and provided prompt service without being intrusive. She was also very observant - I ordered a vegetarian appetizer & entree, and had selected vegetarian-sounding sides that actually were not. She asked if I was vegetarian and let me know that the sides I had selected actually contained bacon. Now that's great service!

Great place for a work lunch, a date, or eating with friends. Service was very professional and efficient. The menu is very large, with a few options for vegetarians. I had the quinoa veggie burger, and I thought it was outstanding. I always get nervous ordering veggie burgers from restaurants in fear they use crap Boca or Morning Star patties, but the White Chocolate Grill makes their own in house and it's wonderful. Very fresh, great light texture that's slightly cripsy on the outside, and the toppings for the burger are so flavorful (aioli that basically dresses everything). It's a little bit on the pricey side, but the atmosphere is very nice and overall a very good experience.

Awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else. Everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking. The pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. The salads are good too, except the chopped vegetable salad which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. The menu description made it sounds like a cheese/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of vegetables - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. I don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. The other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. Can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. The cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. I really liked the banana cheesecake.

Love this little park for hikes and walks! It's quiet, well kept, and beautiful. For the most part the hikes are all easy without much elevation gain. Tons of cactus and open views, creating a nice calm. If you live in the area, I highly recommend this park for hikes!   If you don't live in the area, there are probably closer hikes to you with free admission (this park is $6) and it may not be totally worth the drive.

What a dining experience! My husband and I had so much fun dining here and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great date night out. Each dish is meticulously prepared and presented so beautifully. You get a huge range of flavors and foods over the course of an evening (be prepared for a 3 hour dinner) with some science/food lessons to boot! I didn't necessarily love every single dish, but everything is served in small portions and there are many different kinds so the point is to go on a flavor adventure and get to try lots of different things. Also, this is a great place for vegetarians! Mushroom/black truffle risotto seems to be the single vegetarian dish normally offered at nice restaurants...but at Binkeley's the kitchen prepares so many different and exciting dishes (admittedly many with the addition of truffle oil but that is nothing to complain about).   I really had a great time eating here and can't wait for the next big special occasion that merits a trip back to Binkley's!

I really expected to like Cantina Laredo - upscale mexican food, darkly intimate interior, nice outdoor patio with a fire pit & lights, interesting menu options, and prices that would indicate good food. My issue with Cantina Laredo is their ingredients - everything in our meal came out of a can or a freezer bag which resulted in really stale food. I go out to eat to get food I can't make as well as home, but I'll settle for food that's as good as I make at home...Cantina Laredo couldn't even meet that. The dish concepts really sounded so good, if only they used fresh and good ingredients. We had:  - Chili con queso: I was expecting a queso fundido like dip but instead it was canned nacho cheese with a can of rotel diced tomato/chillis. This would be fine if it was HH & bar food & priced at something around $3...not appropriate to charge $8 for this crap. It really was bad canned nacho cheese. - Spinach Enchiladas: The spinach filling very clearly tasted like frozen spinach (without any fresh garlic or other flavors to dress it up) and the green bean vegetables on the side were very clearly frozen green beans (awful). The roasted poblano cream sauce just tasted like sour cream without any chili flavor. - Chicken Enchiladas: My boyfriend got this dish & enjoyed his enchiladas. However he had the same issue with the green beans, and the rice tasted like boxed rice from the grocery store (which isn't terrible but I would expect an upscale restaurant to do better). - Mango Margarita: Yummy. Easily the tastiest thing I had all night.  The atmosphere in Catina Laredo is nice & enjoyable, but the food is absolutely terrible and they charge way too much for it. Had their food even been average, I'm sure I would go back again, but their food was so bad that I'll never eat here again.

This nail salon is across the street from where I work so I went over during lunch to get a quick manicure. They have a ton of color choices, a lot of people working so there is little wait, and quick service. My manicure was only $15 and it lasted chip-free almost a week. The shellac manicure, which my lady tried to get me to go for, is $25 and supposedly lasts 3 weeks. I'd definitely recommend this salon as a place to get a quality and budget-friendly manicure/pedicure.

The store is on the small side so there isn't much inventory on the inside. I was up in Cave Creek looking for (my first pair of) cowgirl boots and of course thought I could find them at a store with boot company in the name. There weren't many boots, maybe about 10-15 pairs. The lady running the store had a pretty bad attitude when I said I was looking for boots under $200. By pretty bad, I mean condescending and rude. If you are looking for expensive/fancy cowboy wear, then this is the store. I was hoping for a down-to-earth, easy going western store and this definitely isn't it.

Wonderful place for a nice relaxing happy hour. Rare Earth is perfect for Cave Creek residents who don't want to drive far and want to mix it up from the normal cowboy bar/coors light scene. While I love throwing on my boots and sitting on straw bales just as much as the next girl, sometimes it's nice to feel a little fancier. The patio is really nice and the menu has a lot of options. They even have blankets available if you want to sit outside but feel chilly, such a great touch. Service started off really slow but once we got rolling, food and drinks came out quickly. Happy hour here is perfect - from 4-6 pm everyday and $2 off wine & beer, $3 off all appetizers, discounted salads (can't remember exactly), and $6 margherita pizzas.   - Pretzel Board: Yummy, soft, warm pretzels with your choice of dips. We got peanut butter and cheese. The cheese was so bad and disappointing. I was expecting cheesy fondue and it was tasteless. I've never met a cheese dip I didn't like, except canned orange nacho cheese, and this was that but even more mild. Like I couldn't taste anything at all. The peanut butter was awesome though.  - Pear & Blue Cheese Salad: Eh, pass on the salads. It was so tiny but entree-priced. The dressing was really good (light and flavorful) but the salad overall fell flat to me. The blue cheese tasted low end and the walnuts were advertised as being sugar glazed but came out plain (not even toasted). - Margherita: While not the best thin crust pizza I've ever had, it was still very good and a great deal at $6. The crust is just a tad thinner than I'd like and the cheese was a little bare, but it had the wonderful smokiness from a wood fired oven and the flavors were very good. The olive oil was absolutely delicious.   I definitely will be coming back here for HH wine & pizza out on the patio.

Great Home Depot location. It's usually quiet and not crowded, and there are always people available to help. It's smaller than the Lowe's down the road but prices seem to be a little less.  The christmas tree lot here is fantastic - great selection of trees, friendly service, and pretty nicely decorated considering it's a Home Depot.

I recently moved to Scottsdale & needed to find a new hairdresser. I've been going to Aveda salons since college and have always liked how they cut my hair so I expected to get a similar haircut from Salon Sandoval. Unfortunately my cut just wasn't what I asked for or what I've come to expect from Aveda salons. I explained what I wanted (long layers) and ended up with no layers. My hair just fell so badly until I got it re-cut. Seeing as how I already had the layers I wanted in my hair, just an outgrown length, I really thought that they could have done my cut easily.  I've also come to expect the aromatherapy scalp massage at the beginning of a cut from Aveda salons and didn't get one. I didn't really like the interior of the salon either, it was a little too small and cramped. Granted neither of my last two complaints would have mattered if the cut had been good.

Sort of silly to review a fast food chain like Taco Bell but since receiving an incorrect order has happened to me so many times from here I think it bears mention. Getting home and finding the wrong or missing food just sucks. The people working here are exceptionally nice and if you do get a wrong order, they'll fix it quickly...sometimes hooking you up with extra food to compensate, maybe someone else's mixed order food haha. As far as the food quality goes, it's exactly what you would expect for Taco Bell or Pizza Hut. Love the combo. Hate that it's not open late.

Charming Irish bar on the Strip! The atmosphere is really something else - if you close your ears to the sounds of the slot machines it really feels like you're in Ireland! The bar is gorgeous - with everything shipped in from Ireland, it's as authentic as you can get state side. So much so that I felt weird ordering car bombs, but the waitress didn't blink. The inside is very charming, the outdoor patio less so (but drinking outside in the sun is awesome). I ate here a few different times and the food is tasty (but expensive like everything in Las Vegas). The goat cheese salad was very good - fresh arugula, wonderfully caramelized onions, and amazing marinated tomatoes that really put the salad over the top. The Irish Nachos are quite good too and make a perfect bar snack. Beers are $7.50 which seemed a little much to me. And they charge an "entertainment tax" which was more than the sales tax...so remember your meal is going to cost like 40% more once sales tax, entertainment tax, and tip is added in.

Unfortunately this is the worst BJ's location I've ever been to, and I love BJ's food normally. The deep dish pizza was just not that good, and I normally think their deep dish pizza is a model of perfection. The crust wasn't really 'deep' and more like regular pizza crust. The toppings were pitiful - barely any sauce, practically no cheese, and very little of the toppings that were supposed to come with the pizza. I was so disappointed. The service is great but that doesn't really matter to me when the food they are bringing me is sub par. They have all day happy hour when games are on and the bar has a decent number of TV's with NFL Sunday Ticket but the food was too disapointing for me to go back.

THE BEST BROWNIES EVER. You would expect pre-made-who-knows-how-long-ago-and-sealed-in-plastic brownies would be dry and crumbly. I didn't have high expectations, especially since I ate my first one a good two weeks after receiving it. These brownies are the best I've ever had! They are so moist and soft and dense. My favorite is the toffee (giant pieces of soft toffee) but the just plain chocolate is mighty fine too. The caramel and white chocolate are great too. It's impossible to go wrong.

Like its name, Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicana has a correspondingly large food menu & drink menu, and it was all really good. I would definitely return here, whether for happy hour (okay definitely for happy hour) or dinner (also a definite yes). First of all, I LOVE the margarita sampler. Many brewpubs have beer samplers but this the first margarita sampler I've ever had the joy of ordering. Also the menu is quite large, has a ton of variety & a lot of interesting (much more than regular tex-mex) options, and has a lot of good vegetarian options.  My boyfriend & I tried six different margaritas. My favorite margarita was the mango which was ridiculously amazing. A lot of mango margaritas are too sweet or have a very processed fruit taste but not this one - it's perfectly balanced & fresh tasting. I generally really dislike margaritas that come out of the large frozen blended dispenser because they are usually way too low on alcohol and I generally prefer my margaritas on the rocks instead of blended, but the mango that good is super good. My boyfriend's favorite was the coconut. I thought the Texas-Ass Kick-Ass margarita was really smooth with the Shiner Bock floater, and it has a great name. The ones that did not impress was the Ultima (boring when there are other better choices & overpriced at $12) and the Pinnacle Peak Pomegranate (didn't actually taste like pomegranate).   I had the veggie fajitas which were really good and big enough for two meals. All the components of this dish were outstanding. The black beans were really great & have a very good flavor (I think cumin). The guacamole was fresh, full of garlic & lemon, and deliciously chunky. The tortillas were so soft & pliable & thick - I'm not sure if they were freshly made because I didn't see a tortilla maker but they sure tasted that way. The vegetables were a little on the bland side but I added the table salsa & it was great. My boyfriend had the west texas bbq taco's and he really liked them and the mango-chiptole bbq sauce. Also the complimentary chips & salsa were ridiculously good - super thick fried chips and fresh chunky flavorful salsa.  We had awful service at the bar, as in I think that's the rudest a bartender has ever been to me. It took the longest time to get a drink menu and then to put in our drink order. She complained about my order for the sampler to me, to the other bartender, to the other patrons and even had the nerve to say to another patron 'I'm making these drinks terribly, don't order a sampler' loud enough for me and the entire bar to hear. It was awkward. Fortunately our actual server at our table was really nice & friendly.

This is a solid sports bar with a lot of TV's, outdoor seating with TV's, and a good food menu. I love that they have a sign counting down to the next St.Patrick's day, and they do events like trivia night and live music. The food is good and comes in large portions, though I will warn vegetarians that seemingly harmless food (mac & cheese and the cheesy tater tots) somehow comes with meat even though the menu doesn't say anything about it (extreme disappointment if you assume it doesn't, order it, and then can't eat anything). The salads are good (hard to come by at a bar).

Mehhh. I love pizza and I love NY style pizza but this place just didn't do it for me. My slice was kind of floppy and on the cold side. I didn't think the sauce tasted particularly flavorful and would have liked a little bit of a crispier crust. The lunch specials didn't really seem all that special, $7-8 for an okay slice of pizza and a small salad isn't much of a deal. The garlic knots were pretty good, but seemed a tiny bit on the stale side. I much prefer Streets of New York Pizza for lunch when I'm around this area.

Z'Tejas is awesome! They had me at the free cornbread, which is delicious and moist...and free. There are many vegetarian options, most of which are a lot more interesting than the standard veg tex mex fare, which is a large part of why I think this chain is great. The veggie chopped salad is chock full of yummy and fresh toppings, and there is well enough protein (cheese, nuts) to be quite filling, especially with the cornbread starter. The guacamole is fresh and spot on delicious. The interior of the restaurant is really nice, especially around the holidays where they deck it out in string lights (very festive). Service is quick and friendly, parking is (as expected at this mall) a giant pain.

Love hiking in Spur Cross Ranch! If you are looking for a place that feels completely disconnected from the normal world with only the sound of nature, and very few people around, this is the place. It is a bit of a drive once you turn off the main street but it's a very pretty drive. The amount of cactus and greenery here is outstanding and the views are beautiful. There are easy trails and hard trails, and it's easy to get lost in a nice sort of way (aka it's not that hard to find your way back to the trail). Some of the trails go by a creek, which actually does have a good amount of water after a rain.   After hiking in Spur Cross its easy to get a bite, a cup of coffee, or some beers in the quaint town of Cave Creek.

I was so excited to enjoy a fun outing here, but the experience was very underwhelming. Everyone working there is very nice and charming, but the ambiance wasn't enjoyable and overall the food was so so. We came in on a Saturday afternoon with a reservation, and were seated at a small cramped table. Everything inside is close together and crammed together - it ended up feeling really claustrophobic. The acoustics make it much louder than normal restaurants.   We got the multi tiered food platter with scones, sandwiches, and desserts plus two tea pots. Our tea was served and the server said to let them steep for 5 minutes, then 30 seconds she was back pouring them. One of the tea pots spilled all over, which she said they were trying to get rid of those ones (trying, really? you can just do it), and she didn't clean up any of the big puddles left behind. The sandwiches weren't anything special, the desserts were average, but the scones and jam was  good.   The outside of the tea room is much more charming and open than the inside. Perhaps on a weekday the experience is more enjoyable when it's less crowded. If I find myself back in the area and in need of a snack, some scones seated outdoor would be the way to go.

I came in here for lunch during the work week and found it to be a nice place to get away from work for a little while...open patio, big floor to ceiling glass windows, nice lighting. Service was pretty good, not the fastest to get food to your table but that's because the fresh yummy pizzas need their time.   The Harvest Chop salad is really yummy (love pasta in my salad!) and filling. The pizza crust is soft and springy and gets a blistery burnt crust, which I really like.

Pinnacle Peak is my top choice for a beautiful place to experience, see, & admire the great beauty of the Sonoran desert. The hike itself is gorgeous, whether looking in towards the peak and trail or looking outward to the surrounding landscape. I became absolutely enchanted with Arizona on this hike. The trail is covered with many different varieties of cactus & beautiful rock formations. Looking out to the surrounding area is very beautiful as well - there are other rock formations & hills close by and the housing development is unobtrusive. I wasn't sure what to expect from a hike that is in the middle of a bunch of houses because I normally find obvious evidence of civilization to interfere with my enjoyment of nature, but the houses are very muted and I really only noticed the great beauty around.   The hike isn't too challenging, but just enough to feel like you've gotten a workout and are totally deserving of a delicious sonoran brewing company beer from the steakhouse near the parking lot.

Yay! I got the best haircut from Tommy and am so glad to finally have found a good place for haircuts in Scottsdale. I am the kind of person with long hair who dreads getting my haircut because they always take off too much and, as a kind of new resident, all my haircuts in the Scottsdale area have ended poorly. He was really quick and cut off the amount of hair I asked him to.    The salon itself is nice and big. The $15 add-on service scalp massage is not very good, sadly. I loved getting my hair shampooed at salons, and a longer hair shampoo would have been fine, but the "massage" was barely even a shampoo. It wasn't very massage-y at all.

Sweet Republic is perfection! Amazing ice cream and amazing ice cream sundae combinations. The Salted Caramel ice cream is my favorite of the ice cream flavors, with perfect vanilla ice cream swirled with thick creamy caramel all balanced out by the tiniest hint of salt. Some artisan salted caramel ice creams I've had are too strong, where you can only have a few bites, but this one is perfect. The Toffee Banofi sundae is my favorite of the sundaes, with a wonderful combination of sweet and salty and crunchy and smooth. The sundae has plentiful amounts of their homemade almond brittle which is so amazing - deep toffee flavor with delicious pieces of almond. If you like almonds more than peanuts, like I do, you will find this brittle addicting (yes they sell it separately so you can take a bag or a few home). The salted caramel sauce covering the sundae is perfectly gooey and has a very wonderful rich caramel flavor that gets balanced out by the salt. The Campfire S'more sundae is a very cute idea but I found the flavors to be a little too heavily chocolate without anything lighter to balance it out. I get that adding a banana or caramel sauce detracts from the concept of a s'more but in the future I would order it with something like that.   Easily the best ice cream I've had in Arizona and a wonderful place to take your kids, friends, family, date any time of day.

Haiku Grill is near my work place and I was looking for something other than pizza or sandwiches. Unfortunately the stir fry sauce really didn't taste good to me. It's very one-note sweet, and no amount of soy sauce and siracha was saving it. I ordered a Veggie Bowl, which was on the small side. It wasn't large enough to make a full meal of.

This is a great location! You know you're in for a nice grocery shopping experience with the classic music being played in the parking lot. I like this grocery store because it's really big & clean and has a great produce section, great deli with prepared foods, great bakery, yummy cheese and wine bar, and everyone here is nice and helpful. The deli is really big with a large variety of reasonably priced foods and usually a lot of people working so the line is never too long. They have a very big fancy cheese section with the same stuff you can buy from Whole Foods (yay no need for two stops). My favorite part is the bakery - really delicious fresh breads (get the chilli cheese bread!) and amazing giant cupcakes. The cupcakes are absurdly good, especially for being from a regular grocery store instead of a boutique cupcake place, with very soft, moist, fluffy cake and huge amounts of frosting. They have a CUPCAKE BAR so you can choose the type of cake, frosting, and decorations (everything from plastic rings to crushed candy bars to cereal). The produce section is fresh & I've never had a problem with veggies or fruit I've bought here. I think the prices are perfectly reasonable. The ice cream aisle is an entire aisle and if you can't find something to your fancy, there is even a Coldstone within the grocery store. On the way out you can treat yourself to the self-serve ICEE machine. On top of all that, they always have a sizable holiday section to get just about everything you need (and then some).  Truly a one stop shop.

I'm not sure why this Michael's has such bad reviews, but this is one of the best Michael's I've been to in terms of organization, wide aisles, & a nice/new store setting. The interior feels new, the aisles are wide, and everything is stocked & organized well! The latter quality is a hard one to come by at most Michaels. The people working there are friendly and it wasn't hard to find someone to help. I've had to get help with someone getting a ladder to grab items off high shelves and looking throughout the store for a specific item, and found both associates very friendly and helpful. Lastly, there is just 1 line into all the cash registers so you don't have to deal with old ladies just walking up to separate registers instead observing 1 honorary line...Love this Michaels!

Came in for dinner on Saturday and the food was really bad. I am surprised at all the good reviews. My cheese enchiladas were served lukewarm, and the cheese on the inside was still cold and not melted. To make it worse, the enchilada sauce was bland. The black beans were bland. No reason to come back.

The Mission is a great place to come for a fancier Mexican meal. The atmosphere is trendy and fun, there are a ton of drink options, and the food is quite good. I had:  - Tableside Guacamole: Rather overpriced at $12 for 1 avocado's worth of mush but perfectly delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and it had the prefect amount of citrus, garlic, cilantro, and spice.  - Butternut Squash Tacos: Yummy! I was nervous that the squash would be too sweet but the flavors ended up working very well together and it was a satisfying savory dish. This is the only vegetarian entree, but I don't think vegetarians suffer with this delicious dish. It isn't all that big so definitely order an appetizer or additional side. - White Bean Puree: Super delicious and kind of like an awesome mexican take on hummus.  - Espresso Churros with Milkshake: Awesome dessert. I hate coffee flavored desserts and thankfully this one didn't taste a thing like espresso. The churros are warm and soft and taste good on their own or paired with the milkshake. The milkshake is basically a vanilla version of mexican hot chocolate with strong notes of cinnamon and other spices.  I definitely recommend the Mission as a place to bring a date, your girlfriends, your parents, basically anyone you like.

J & G Steakhouse is a great place to come for a romantic and yummy meal, even for a vegetarian. From start to finish, the service is great and the atmosphere is fancy and nice. The view from the restaurant is gorgeous if you come for an early dinner while it's still light enough to see out. My boyfriend & I came here for a special date night and had a great time and I would recommend it for other couples. We had:  - Endive Salad: This was the least spectacular dish of the night but it was still fine. I found the dish to be too heavy on raw hard vegetables - thick endive, thick raw peas, and raw fennel.  - Tomato Soup: Nice & comforting. It tasted like really yummy tomato vodka pasta sauce in soup consistency. The cheddar toast it was served with was delicious. - Corn Ravioli with Basil Fondue: Amazing! I got this appetizer dish entree-sized as my vegetarian entree, and it's one of the yummiest dishes if you love pesto. The basil fondue is like a very fresh, very flavorful pesto sauce without the excess oil and much smoother and thinner. It was so amazing and went very well with the fresh corn raviolis. The ravioli had a great thin tender texture. - Prime Rib Eye: My boyfriend had this and said the meat was great. The J&G signature steak sauce on the other hand was pretty weird. It had a very strong orange & anise flavor, and wasn't to either of our likings.  - Salted Caramel Sundae: Yummy, pretty hard to mess up great ice cream and a lot of hot fudge. I didn't love the texture of popcorn with smooth ice cream so I ate that part separately. - Apple Tart: My boyfriend ordered this one and didn't like it but I did, so I got two desserts. I really liked the soft thick candied texture of the apple and the buttery pastry crust. The cinnamon ice cream was okay, but I ended up thinking the tart was yummier without it.

Humble Pie has a fantastic lunch special where you can get any salad and any pizza for under $10. The salads are great and there are a ton of different pizza options, including some fancy vegetarian ones. I had the apple arugula salad, which was amazing. It is such a refreshing salad, and the dressing was amazing. I also had the arugula pizza, which I picked because of the house-made mozzarella, and it was okay. The cheese was sort of grainy as opposed to being luscious and thick, and I didn't love the taste of the crust (tasted a little like Chinese food, which was unexpected), but overall it was satisfying.   I would definitely come back here for a salad.

I love that the airport has a place with fresh, healthy, customizable food! Paradise Bakery has a salad bar (how often have you seen an airport with a salad bar?!), and though they don't have the hugest selection of toppings there are a good number of interesting options beyond just tomato/cucumber/carrots. The bakery section has a lot of tempting treats and a good standard selection of sandwiches.

Yogurtology has the BEST frozen yogurt! The Butterfinger flavor tastes exactly like a butterfinger candy bar but in cold liquid ice-cream form. It is my favorite and it is out of this world good. The caramel is really good too, and of course the plentiful toppings that you can add in whatever proportion you want are great too.

Pita Jungle is a great place for lunch or dinner, with lots of vegetarian options and healthy options. The only real downfall of this location is the noise - with a full work week crowd at lunch, it's insanely loud...like almost having to yell at your companions to be heard loud. I got the Pesto Pita pizza, which was yummy and filling, and a Greek Salad which was fresh and good.

Finally - a bbq place that is good for the meat eater and a vegetarian! Plus nice indoor and outdoor seating and cute decor. Bryan's has multiple vegetarian options, which is pretty amazing. Things I've had:  - Fried artichoke po'boy: Really good! The artichoke hearts were nicely and lightly fried, the sandwich had an amazing creamy garlic and mustard sauce piled plentifully, the bread was buttered and toasted to a very nice crispiness, and there were fresh tomatoes and real romaine lettuce. - Pulled Squash: So unique and soooo incredibly good. The bun is buttered to high heaven and combined with the hot squash covered in an amazing BBQ, every bite is just marvelous. Sweet, savory, buttery, smooth, firm, yummmo. I prefer this to the fried artichoke po'boy. - Baked potato salad: Yummy take on traditional potato salad but I think the french fries are the best side they have (and worth the extra quarter). - Olive Coleslaw: Not a huge fan of coleslaw, but this seemed better to me than most. Balanced sweetness and the coolness goes really well with the hot Pulled Squash sandwich. - French fries: Perfect - dark, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside without being mealy, and seasoned nicely. M - Brisket sandwich: My husband gets this,  and while he said wasn't as good as others he has had, it must still be yummy because he orders it everytime.   We both really liked the spicy bbq sauce - it's not as sweet as the light color would suggest and it has a really pleasant smokiness to it. Keep in mind that you will be ordering from a counter, getting your own food when called, and busing your own table. I felt a little silly after leaving a 20+% tip the first few times. In any case, I highly recommend Bryan's BBQ for the vegetarians!

By far the best waxing experience I've ever had in my 7-8 years of getting various wax treatments. They use hard wax, and they use it much better than any other salon I've been to. In the past I've found that hard wax hurts more than the strip wax which already hurts (a lot) but the ladies at European Wax Center are super gentle & well taught.   The place is incredibly clean (I watched the lady wipe down the table & put new coverings on). The people are nice & efficient. Most importantly, this is the least painful waxing experience I've ever had which is pretty fantastic. I didn't experience any hard sells or pitches, and frankly I'd be fine with it because I do want their services.

Used Yelp to try to find a place to get a breakfast sandwich on our walk up to Edinburgh Castle and Hula looked the most promising. As much as I'd like to support local businesses, I wish we had just gone to Starbucks. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my husband got a ham/cheese bagel. They were fine, but so overpriced. For the same amount of money we could have gotten breakfast sandwiches with better stuff in them (like actual eggs!) from Starbucks.

I was expecting a great meal from Cartwright's because I love the food from Tonto, which is the sister restaurant. Unfortunately it was overall disappointing which is too bad, because the atmosphere is cozy and nice and the service was good. The (relatively) new vegetarian-friendly menu is what drew me in but it wasn't anything too exciting - salads from the main menu, a few unexciting appetizers, and two entree choices (an assortment of vegetable sides or vegetarian chili).   I ordered the $15 vegetarian chili and was so disappointed in what was served - beans and vegetables in a thin broth and the whole thing had a sour taste to it. I want my chili to be thick and comforting, and this dish had none of those qualities. My husband ordered the pork shoulder/chorizo and liked the meat portion of his dish but didn't care for any of the sides.   I'll be sticking with Tonto when looking for a good upscale meal in Cave Creek.

Two & a half stars for VU Bistro because the view isn't really that great, service is really slow, portions are too small, and the menu is overpriced.   There are a lot of houses in the immediate area so the view really is primarily of houses & a road. The view is prettier from the street that this restaurant is off of. The service was super slow when my boyfriend & I went on a Saturday afternoon even though there weren't many people there - it took forever for someone to take our order and then the food took a really really long time to come out.   The food itself was pretty good but the portions were generally quite small. We shared the bruschetta  appetizer which was my favorite dish from the night. The apple, brie, sugared walnuts slices were great and the garlic rubbed on the bread was a nice touch. The traditional tomato bruschetta was also really good with lots of fresh garlic & basil. The salad I got was rather basic, very tiny, there were barely any toppings, and the balsamic vinaigrette was boring. My boyfriend's bbq chicken pizza was better but very small & the chicken was tossed onto the pizza after it was done baking so none of the chicken actually stuck to the pizza and lacked the flavors that would normally come from the combination of sauce and cheese.  Basically this place strikes me as a place cougars go to drink a lot of wine...a great scene for some & not for others, depending on your preference.

Not a great place to go before a Coyote's game, despite its prime location. As usual, Yard House had a ridiculous wait and McFadden's patio was empty so we headed over there...mistake. Go eat and drink anywhere else. Their service was atrocious and the food/prices don't make up for it. Despite being deserted, we were given a buzzer thing to wait for a table (told a 20 minute wait). We went and sat at the outside bar, which only has 3 beers on tap. After waiting for 45 minutes, we checked in at the front to see how much longer it would be. The lady said she had been calling our names over the microphone...clearly the microphone doesn't work in their outdoor space and the buzzer thing never buzzed. The hostess then told us the buzzers don't work...why give it out then? And why not get us from the bar? Having clearly requested an outdoor table, we were seated indoors. The menu is small and doesn't have much of anything interesting. We ordered onion rings, and a lot of beers. The onion rings came out immediately and based on their sogginess, they obviously had just been sitting out in the kitchen. Beers weren't poured great (small pours).

My husband and I had a wonderful Valentine's Day lunch at Petite Maison and I highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion - quick lunch, business lunch, dinner date, girlfriends meal. The place is so ADORABLE! The patio is gorgeous, with flowering lush trees and climbing greens over the fireplace. Service was great and I really enjoyed the food. We had:  - Ricotta & Walnut Bread Appetizer: They had fromage blanc instead of the ricotta, which when eaten alone was flavorless but when combined with the crisp walnut bread & honey, was delectable. - Roasted Cauliflower & Farro Entree: This was the vegetarian entree and I loved it! I have to give big props to Petite Maison for having a "purpose made" vegetarian entree on a menu that only has 5 or 6 entrees. I'm so used to having to order something without the meat, which usually means something in the dish is missing. This was heaven made for a vegetarian. The combination of lemon, feta, almonds, sweet potatoes, and 4 beautiful colors of cauliflower was so wonderful. This was really fantastic and I would happily order it over and over. - Steak: My husband got this and his dish certainly wasn't as beautiful as mine. I don't think he loved it as much as I loved my entree but he had no complaints either.  The only bummer were the flies on the patio. I doubt it's something the restaurant can control, but it was a little hard to relax and slowly savor a meal while having to constantly shoo away flies from my entree. But, that certainly won't stop me from coming back and sitting on the patio again!

I really liked the style of my haircut from Ohana Salon. I like my hair long with long layers and a little face layering, and I got a great cut from Erin but she did take off about 2 inches more than the 1 I wanted. I do wish I had the length back, but I know that at least the cut is right and it will grow back.   Overall my experience at the salon was really nice. The interior is very nicely designed and feels like a great salon. They begin each appointment with a really nice scalp & neck massage, and while you're getting shampooed you also get an arm massage. I would warn people about the pressured sales approach you may get. I'm used to salons trying to push their products on me, but I felt more uncomfortable turning things down while in the chair at the beginning of my haircut. Aka so I ended up buying a $25 deep conditioning treatment that was just 5 minutes of sitting with stuff sprayed into my hair which not surprisingly did nothing at all (oops - be warned). Also I wouldn't recommend coming here just for a blow out. Normally blow outs at Aveda salons are fantastic, and this was my first bad one. I say it's bad because it didn't really have those normal gorgeous curves and bounce and it only lasted the day where normally they last a few. Next time I come for a cut I am going to see if I can cut out the blow out to save some money.

So beautiful! This park is the perfect place to come to pretend you are in the middle of nowhere and admire the great natural beauty of Arizona. Even before entering the park it's easy to feel like you've left society and heavy development behind, because all you can see are rocky mountains and miles of cactus and all you can hear is nature. My boyfriend and I did the North Trail, which was very scenic. There are trail markers around & a trail guide at the beginning so you can do a self guided tour, but most of the stops were kind of boring or the plant that was supposed to be there was dead. I think it would be really great for kids, but adults can probably skip it. My only complain about the trail (and it's really not a valid complaint) is that the entire trail is flat so it was too easy. The park is really well maintained, as in the bathrooms are clean & stocked with toilet paper and soap. The rangers are really nice & helpful and will definitely help you figure out a good trail for you.

Great pub to stop in and sample lots and lots of different scotches. My husband and I were here just for drinks and a little snack. They have scotch flights available, which is a nice touch if you want to sample a variety. Not being a scotch drinker myself, I had a wonderful few glasses of the Thistle Cross apple cider which they have on tap and it's wonderful. Much much much better than the sickly sweet Bulmers everywhere else. My husband had a great time talking to the bartenders to identify really peaty scotches to drink, and they were very helpful in pointing him to new things to try. We had chips with cheese as a snack - they were standard good but a rather small serving size.

Barro's is our favorite local pizza place. The food is really good & the prices are totally reasonable...it's a great place to grab dinner from during the work week, weekend lunch, or grubbing food for a day watching sports.   The pizzas are great. The crust is nice and thick with a very clean bread taste. The pizza sauce is very flavorful and the cheese is piled on plentifully. The pizza is just slightly salty and greasy (from the melted cheese), in a very pleasant and delicious way. Each bite into a slice is warm, cheesy, and oozy. This is exactly the kind of comforting pizza you want after a long day. The vegetarian pizza is awesome as well - tons of fresh veggie toppings and super thick.  The cheesy bread is really amazing - delightfully thick crust covered in a buttery garlic topping smothered in cheese served with pizza or marinara sauce (your choice) for dipping. The $3 price tag for what amounts to a medium-sized pizza can't be beat, either. The cinnamon bread is gigantic, a wonderful dessert, and it's nearly impossible to stop eating. It's basically pizza crust covered in butter and cinnamon sugar, served with sugar glaze dipping sauce. So good!

My boyfriend & I hiked Tom's Thumb from the back entrance, in Troon Valley. When you start from this alternate trail head the hike is only 3 miles, and gives gorgeous views of wide open spaces with very little house/city views. There are a lot of pretty places to stop and take a picture (and a breather because this hike isn't easy but is doable).

Fort McDowell is set in beautiful surroundings with fun for all ages! I highly recommend coming out here for one of their many party or outdoor activities. It's located on a Native American reservation so the land is truly unspoiled and is beautiful every direction you look.  If you're looking to get away from "it" (the city) for a little bit or to have a little cowboy experience, this is the place to come!  On Friday nights they have a family-friendly event for families to come and roast hot dogs & s'mores, watch movies outdoors, and just have fun out in nature. Once a month they have something called Adult Education, which is sooooo much fun! For $30 it's all you can drink, all you can eat, and you get to run around the desert. My fiance & I went to one and can't wait to go back for another. They have a Tequila Bus, a party bus in school bus-form, that they drive everyone out to the desert in all while doing shots and playing fun fiesta music. There is also a stationary Rum Bus with a sandy floor, delicious daiquiris and pina coladas, and fun island music. We had food catered by Bobby Q's and it was so delicious (and there were vegetarian options, too!).  There are two wonderful buildings on the land for hosting parties and events, both with a very nice spanish hacienda feel to them. We were really close to having our wedding here, but ended up choosing someplace else because it's far from where we live. However if you live closer, this would be such a great wedding venue!  Most of all, the people working here are genuinely nice & kind and want to make sure you're having a great time. It's a very welcoming place and I love it!

What can I say that other reviewers haven't? This place is awesome for vegetarians (there are like 8 different vegetarian taco choices!) and the salsa bar is awesome (strawberry salsa!). I really liked the guacamole, which was chunky and light with refreshing chunks of jicama and tomato with the avocado.

This is a fantastic Lowe's location. It's big & new so the aisles are big, light, and there are tons of different products. I find Lowe's to be better organized than Home Depot in general, so that's a good thing. This location has a good sized garden center. Customer service has always been great. We went the weekend after Thanksgiving, expecting a mad and messy place, but it wasn't crowded and everything was organized and in its place.  The paint section carries Valspar & Olympic, but they are able to mix Benjamin Moore paints without requiring a paint swatch to match (their computer database has a bunch saved).  The only negative is that their christmas tree lot is awful. The trees don't look great and they only had Noble Firs, not any Douglas Firs. No one was even out there when we went and it's poorly lit.

Talavera offers outstanding service, very good food, and an absolutely gorgeous setting for a special meal. The price tag is hefty but I left feeling like I had a luxurious meal so I certainly think it's worth it for celebratory occasions. The service was superb. It seemed like our waiter was dedicated to us and our table of 2 (even if that wasn't the case). There was never a long wait, it always felt like he was going above and beyond, and it was all very nice. When making my reservation with Open Table I noted it was someone's birthday and the menus were specially printed with a birthday message - talk about a nice touch! The setting is breathtakingly gorgeous. Of course the Four Seasons grounds are beautiful, and there is wonderful Pinnacle Peak and the sunset to enjoy off the patio. If the weather allows it, I highly recommend a patio table.   The food was very good too. I guess the only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 stars is that the dessert wasn't all that great. I should say the dessert we paid for* because the complimentary truffles we received with a birthday message (again, what outstanding and caring service!) were amazing. I had:  - Beet & Goat Cheese Salad: Such a beautiful dish, a real treat for the eyes. It also tasted very good, so while not unique nor large, it was a yummy start to the meal. I probably wouldn't order it again though - the only app I need is the complimentary buttery skillet bread. - Butternut Squash Risotto: The vegetarian entree for the day and I initially groaned because risotto is the de facto veg entree. This was the best risotto I've ever had! So creamy yet the rice still had a strong texture to it, instead of being mushy. The mushrooms and other vegetables were a great mix of textures and overall the flavor was very good. - Chocolate Mousse: I just didn't like this. It was too rich and I've never met a chocolate mousse I didn't like. Some fresh berries or a light cream could have gone a long way in balancing it out. - Croissant Creme Brulee: Also underwhelming. The fried carrot strips were not to my taste and the croissant pieces just seemed stale.

Good place to hang out before a game at the stadium, but get there early if you want to eat at a table because it gets packed. The beers are big & cold, and I've always liked the crowd there before games. It's people who want to have fun but are relaxed, and a nice energy gets going before the game.   The menu is standard and I've only ever had the veggie burger here which is consistently good - two Gardenburger patties (a relief for vegetarians who don't want fake meat) piled with cheese and traditional toppings. The fries are good.

Awesome place to get a really yummy cup of coffee and do some work (free wifi & lots of tables). The interior reminds me of Starbucks, which is a compliment in my book. There are outdoor tables, indoor tables, bar stools, and sofa seating. The people working there are really nice and will bring your coffee to your table if you're staying. The thing I love most is the standard cup of joe is an amazing cup of freshly ground pour-over coffee and it is absolutely perfect. Smoky, thick, hot, and delicious. It's miles ahead of normal drip coffee. Thinking about it makes me want to drive over there for some.

What isn't there to love about Bosa donuts? I love this place for their donuts and awesome savory breakfast sandwiches, and there is a drive thru for when you're feeling especially gluttonous and lazy :). The donuts are light on the inside, dense on just the outside layer, and not overly sweet. I have yet to have a bad donut from Bosa, but I especially love the old fashioned. The breakfast sandwiches are great, I love to get them on a croissant, and though I'm pretty sure the eggs are precooked and just microwaved like at McDonald's, the light and airy croissant just takes the whole thing up a notch.

What an amazing experience that would not be possible without the fantastic & encouraging people who instruct at Trapeze U!   I have an incredible fear of heights and roller coasters, and did not really want to do this - I went to meet some newly made friends there. As I was watching what was involved I started getting sweaty, nauseous, & short of breath...pretty much a train wreck. The first time up the ladder I didn't want to let go and the poor guy up there very nicely coaxed me to get on the ledge. Then of course I couldn't jump off it...again the very nice instructor on the ledge and the instructors down below gave lots of encouragement and support...and soon I was flying through the air. At the end of the class, because of the wonderful instructors, I was able to jump (hep in circus talk) and completed a catch & a backflip...which was a miracle I didn't think possible at the beginning.   It was a great feeling of accomplishment and I can't praise the people at Trapeze U enough. They learned and used the names of every single person in the class (15 of us over 1.5 hours) which is kind of a feat in itself. The other people in the class really come together to cheer everyone else on, following the leads of the instructors. Really nice, kind, supportive staff and a fantastic experience!

The Caramel Chew flavor is amazing! Cherry on Top doesn't have quite as impressive flavor options or topping options as Yogurtology, but it's a lot closer if  you live in the area. I found a lot of the candy bar toppings to be too ground down (like a powder) instead of small chunks, but you can dig around to find the right size. I was really impressed and excited that they have a little paper divider thing you can put into your cup to separate two flavors of fro yo that may not go together. So simple, but genius.   Definitely recommend this location for your frozen yogurt fix!

What a great neighborhood restaurant! Nice people, good food, great wine list (according to a novice wine drinker), nice atmosphere, and live music! The restaurant is giant, so I can't imagine there would ever be a wait. There is no outdoor seating, but the bar area has a cool set up with couches for lounging in addition to normal high tops. The menu has a good mix of appetizers, pastas, and pizza. We had:  - Caprese Salad: Very good! House made mozzarella (not mind blowing but definitely more flavorful than the kind from the grocery store) - Spinach & Artichoke Pizza: Super good! Nice thin blistery crust, lots of cheese (I hate when fancy pizza places under-cheese...I get that's the style but pizza should be cheese), and the white sauce is flavorful. - Tagliatelle Amatriciana: I only had a bite of this, but really liked the house pasta. It's thick and hearty.  The live music on Friday was mellow 60's/70's songs and was fantastic. I can't wait to come back here for happy hours and dinners.

Great place to get some food and watch a game (or games). There are tons of large screen TV's up on the wall and the booths (15 or so of them) have their own TVs. The outdoor patio is really nice and surrounded by a quiet, peaceful area and there are also TVs out there so it's the best of both worlds.   The menu is good - standard bar fare but done better. I had the vegetarian black bean burger which was giant and very filling. The patty was just okay, but all the toppings and cheese on top was flavorful. My fiance had the bbq burger and liked it a lot. The french fries are bomb - shoestring fries with soft insides and crispy outsides. Prices are about $10-12/burger. They have some drink and food specials on Sunday for football, which is nice.  Since O'Donoghues down the street closed, this is the best sports bar in terms of number of TVs and good food left in the area.

My review is solely for the nightlife/dancing.  I haven't had any of the food or mixed drinks, just beer and dancing. Living in Cave Creek, Old Town seems way too far away in general and certainly way too expensive of a cab ride away. Going out and dancing to music that isn't country music seems to be limited to either the Blue Martini or here (if I'm wrong, some one please tell me!). Sure the dance floor isn't big and sure not a ton of people get out and dance, but the DJs have always been good enough and I've always had a good time. I'm from California so I like the bar vibe (wannabe beach bar). The parking lot is giant so it's nice to not have an issue with that too.

Awesome cupcakes with great presentation and packaging. I'm partial to the vanilla cake-based cupcakes but the rest of my family prefers the chocolate cake-based, so I think it's hard to go wrong. The cake portion is light and moist, and the proportion of frosting to cake is perfect (slightly more cake but enough frosting for each bite). I personally love the vanilla frosted vanilla cupcake - sweet with a strong vanilla flavor. I also love the chocolate chip cookie frosted vanilla, and the salted caramel vanilla. The salted caramel chocolate is really good, as is the peanut butter chocolate. Okay I pretty much love them all. I don't think you can go wrong here! They do a really nice job of packaging as well, with cute boxes, ribbon, and stickers.

Absolutely love the concept of getting to go out, eat good food, and it still be good for you! Typically it feels like healthy eating is an at-home activity only. Seasons 52 has an upscale atmosphere so it's good for work lunches. I had the Vegetarian Tasting Plate, which was quite good. The tofu was my favorite - great savory flavor and a good consistency. The prices are a little high so unfortunately I won't eat here as often as I would if entrees were in the $10 range. Service was prompt and I was in & out in an hour at lunch (another reason it's good for a work lunch).

I've been to The House at Secret Garden a few times for private events. The area is absolutely gorgeous but their food & service is just mediocre.   One event I went to was in the patio & sun room, and the other was in the urban barn. The patio was very nice but the room is a standard plain white room.  The urban barn is cute from the outside but the inside is a little janky. The ceiling and beams are unfinished ugly wood with the manufacturer stamps still visible and spray painting...they could have at least stained them a neutral brown. There are faux wooden beams painting on the wall. Not that impressive, but the area outside (we had cocktails under the carob tree) is beautiful.  The food and service is a different story. One of the meals was catered by Santa Barabara catering and it was fantastic. If you're hosting an event here, I recommend going with a buffet from the catering company. The other meal was a sit down, pre-selected 3 course dinner. The kitchen/servers had zero coordination. One person out of the table would get their hot entree a good 10 minutes before anyone else got theirs. It was near impossible to get beers and was impossible to get a refill of water. I thought the food was disappointing. I had:  - Goat Cheese & Beet Salad: By far the best thing I had. Great dressing, yummy goat cheese, fresh greens.  - Vegetarian Trio: So small and just okay. The grilled eggplant was very soggy and the tomato jam it was topped with was far too sweet for an entree. The arancini ball was delicious but I only got one...for my entree. If there had been 3 then it would have been a meal. - Chocolate Cake with Fudge, Fleur De Sel Caramel, & Buttercream Frosting: Amazing sounding description but one of the worst desserts I've ever had. The cake was so dry and barely had a chocolate flavor. There was about a tablespoon's worth of frosting and not even a teaspoon of caramel. So so dry and lacking the richness or flavor of a chocolate dessert. - Bread Pudding: Much better than the chocolate cake but still average.  If you're planning on hosting an event at The House at Secret Garden, I recommend trying to make it as outdoors as possible (prettiest) and not using their in house catering.

Someburro's is a great place to grab an inexpensive meal when you are too tired to make anything and/or feel like having a big satisfying mexican meal. You can call in your meal ahead of time and tt has a drive thru if you're really feeling lazy. I like Someburro's when I feel like having a fatty, lazy meal - you can deep fry whatever you order for $1 more.   - Veggie Burrito: This baby comes double wrapped (yes, TWO giant tortillas) and is filled with beans, cheese, and their very good guacamole salsa. I really like the guac-salsa more than the regular guacamole. The guac-salsa is literally guacamole mixed with pico de gallo and somehow the combination is better than the two parts. I get this enchilada style with the red sauce, which is really really good enchilada sauce. It is very creamy and thick and has a very yummy flavor. - Cheese Enchiladas: Not as good as the enchilada-style veggie burrito (I think) but passable. Definitely get the meal version because the enchiladas themselves are on the small side. - Rice & Beans: Nothing special here, just standard average orange rice and refried beans.

Despite it's name (which makes me think of a dirty bar south of the border), Spotted Donkey has fancy mexican food in a upscale, nice setting. The interior is split into a few different areas, all of which are pretty and cool. The patio is awesome - trees draped in lights, lanterns on every table, & a sweet fireplace. I really like this place! We had:  - Nachos: Really yummy & loaded nacho's. The chips are whole fried tortillas and they are covered in a ton of delicious stuff. The black beans are delicious, the salsa/hot sauce is delicious, and the different kinds of cheese make the whole plate cheesy with different flavors. We got the short stack, which was perfect as an app size. These definitely are awesome with margaritas, and the full size is perfect for hanging at the bar. - Cheese Enchiladas: Good flavors, but the tortillas were so hard and unpleasantly hard to chew. The pinto beans are yummy, the green enchilada sauce is flavorful, but the carrot slaw was way too sweet and didn't blend well with the rest of the flavors. - Chop Salad: I love the fact that they toss & serve a salad tableside. The ingredients are all fresh and it's a hearty sized salad (perfect as a full sized meal with some nachos). - Sonoran Sunset: Beautiful colors, fun name, & a good balance in flavors. - Mango Margarita: So awesome. Really fresh, sweet mango flavor without being overly sweet and it has a wonderful smooth texture. Love this drink! - Mango Strawberry Margarita: A little too sweet...the mango is better. - Cactus Heart: Fun name, pretty purple color, and delicious.

I love that there are restaurants pushing healthy food. I love that this restaurant has an endless menu of vegetarian options, which is an odd (in a good way) feeling while trying to decide what to order when eating out. I'll admit that the food could use more flavor in the way of more herbs and spices, but overall I really like this place and will come back. The atmosphere is great and service is attentive. I had:  - Herb hummus: Regular hummus dressed up with greek crudites (olives, cucumber, tomato, feta, etc) served with yummy soft pita bread. This is a great app to share. - Meditterean Salad: Like two meals in one. It was mostly quinoa and my only complaint is that it should come with with more lettuce/arugula or be relabeled as a Quinoa Salad. There were tons of yummy feta and marcona almonds which with the quinoa made a very filling meal. - Strawberry seasonal soda: Yum - fruity and spritzer and so refreshing! Kind of pricey at $4 with no refill, but so perfect for a warm summer day.

Great place to grab breakfast for breakfast or lunch! It's small and casual, but a little on the pricey side. I had a great vegetable omelets at Tryst. A lot of diner type place's omelets and eggs end up having an off taste from the oil or dish used which thankfull is not the case here. Tryst's omelet is fluffy, thick, has great cooked vegetables, and enough cheese to make it filling without being greasy or heavy. The roasted potatoes served with the omelet are good.

Yogurtology is one of the best fro-yo places I've ever been to. I really like that it's self serve so I can do exactly what I want with the large number of different ice cream flavors (10ish) and topping options (50ish). What really sets this place apart is that the frozen yogurt actually tastes good. The butterfinger fro yo (my favorite) really does taste like a butterfinger bar. The salted caramel and cupcake batter are also exceptional. The self pick toppings are out of this world. There is all the fresh fruit you could want, but who wants fresh fruit when ever chocolate bar and baked good is available for you to mix in?! Heath bar, crushed butterfinger, twix, snickers, reeses peanut butter cups, M&M's, reeses pieces, peanut M&M's, moon pies, donuts, cookie dough, etc etc etc. It really is other wordly. Then there is every sauce option - caramel, chocolate, peanut butter, nutella, cake frosting, marshmallow, butterscotch, etc etc etc. It really is heaven. They keep the place super clean and it's open relatively late (and if it's closed, go next door to Fry's and visit their awesome bakery).

Rather good & fresh Italian food for a place that is a chain and is located in a strip mall-ish area. The inside is large with many tables so you shouldn't ever have to wait too long, and there are many servers and chefs so your food should come out pretty quickly. Also, the corkage fee is only $5 so you can easily bring a bottle to enjoy with your meal.  I would definitely recommend including one of their side salads with your entree. I had the chopped salad which was delicious (all fresh ingredients, a lot of toppings) and my boyfriend had the house salad which he really enjoyed. I ordered the napoli pizza, which was pretty good: the crust is thick & bready, a lot of cheese, but the sauce was low on flavor & the "fresh basil" listed as an ingredient actually was 1 giant basil leaf baked into the middle of the pizza (no longer fresh and not really edible), though all in all it was a good pizza.  My boyfriend had the shrimp & lobster ravioli with sherry tomato sauce and he really enjoyed it. We were both too full for dessert, but there were some yummy looking choices.   The servers didn't seem particularly happy but it was New Years Eve so they probably wanted everyone to eat & leave quickly so they could too. Our waitress kept giving us & the bottle of champagne we brought funny glances but I think it was because she was trying to figure out how old we were and whether to ask...after we showed our IDs, she was quite nice. All in all, it was a satisfying meal and I definitely recommend eating here.

The ladies working here are very nice and the store itself is quite nice. If you're on a budget, this store could be a great place to get a dress. The owner and staff are kind & professional and will devote their time to helping you try on dresses. Other discount bridal stores in AZ seem to think that if you're on a budget then a dingy dark store with minimal help is acceptable...Brilliant Bridal is the opposite of that. The dresses are buy-as-is meaning you are buying the dress on the rack and not ordering it...which also means if you find a dress you really like and wait on it, someone else may buy it. Brilliant Bridal offers a deposit option where you can put some non-refundable money down and they will hold a dress for you for a time period so you can have more thinking time.  Though I'm not sure that I'll find the dress for me here, I would recommend the store to other brides who are looking for nice dresses at a discount and who still want a nice wedding dress experience. And if you tend towards having a hard time making decisions, remember their deposit & hold program.

Hands down the best food you could get from PHX and from airports in general. It's not cheap ($50 for dinner for my boyfriend & I) but airport food never is. The place is nicer than other airport eatery sitting areas but the tables are uncomfortable close to the next person's so that's a little weird (and my only 'complaint' about the place). The food is yummy & fresh. We had:   - Pretzels with Cheese Fondue: Whatever you do, get this dish! The pretzels are wonderfully soft, thick, have a great flour yeast flavor, perfect amount of salt, and are damn good pretzels. The cheese fondue really puts this dish over the top, it's perfect and warm and comforting and have a great real cheese (not nacho cheese grossness) flavor. Oh my gosh this really has to be the single best thing at PHX.  - Mediterranean Salad: So fresh & with the pretzels as an appetizer it was a very satisfying meal. The salad is decently sized & the feta cheese was very yummy.  - Chicken Pita Sandwich: My boyfriend ordered this and had no complaints.  - French fries: Great french fries. I like these ones because they're thicker than McDonalds size but smaller than a steak fry, and are thick on the outside like they've been double fried and nice and soft on the inside.   If you have the time, definitely get a meal here and make sure you get the pretzel fondue appetizer!

Jose Roux is your BEST food option if you're around the southwest gates. Between Jose Roux & Barfly, there is no need to eat crappy food at the Phoenix airport. Not only is Jose Roux's food fresh & good, it's incredibly well priced for airport food. I got the veggie taco plate  ($6 for 2 tacos, rice, & beans) and was so surprised and pleased with how good it was. The tortillas were delicious and are the thick corn style. The tacos had a nice layer of cheese, fresh veggies, and good salsa.

If I could Janet 7 stars, I would. I can't praise her work on my wedding dress enough. She is so incredibly skilled, patient, and so very nice to boot. I bought my dream dress as a sample gown, 12 sizes too big. Course after buying it, I researched online about wedding dress alterations and everyone says that the most a dress can be changed is 2 to 4 sizes, max. Well Janet took my dress down TWELVE sizes and it turned out amazing! She is so patient and won't stop until the dress is perfect and you are 100% satisfied. I had a lot of work done - taken in 12 sizes for an allover lace dress, cups added, cleaned (since it was a sample gown it needed a little bit of help), hemmed, neckline altered to a sweetheart shape, and a french/american combo bustle. The alterations ended up costing more than the dress however the dress was a steal and the work was priced the same as other alteration places would charge, however I am positive that the other places couldn't have worked the miracles she did. I ended up with the dress of my dreams in budget and I couldn't be happier with Janet's work.  She also can make you garter(s) and a veil to match your dress. You can trust Janet to treat and fix your wedding dress beautifully

I work down the street from Pizza Re and we've been getting their wonderful giant pizzas delivered for lunch for some time, to the delight of me & my coworkers. The pizza is awesome! It has a great thin crust with a moist, springy, & chewy end, and very fresh & light & flavorful tomato sauce, and wonderful amounts of cheese. Pizza Re puts the perfect amount of oregano on their pizzas to give every bite a fresh & flavorful kick. I think the crust and sauce, which are my definition of great pizza, really set Pizza Re apart from other places. They have a lot of different specialty pies, from margerita to fig/jalapeno. They sell an 18" pizza which is perfect for feeding a large group, and it's fun to eat giant slices.   Because of the awesome delivery, I came in with my husband for dinner after work and really like their restaurant location as well. The inside is industrial (brick walls, exposed pipes) with big windows to let in the sun. There's one table outside, in the shade in the evening. The people working there are really nice, upbeat, and helpful. In addition to pizza, I also got the "big salad" made vegetarian by subbing in avocado and artichoke for the chicken and bacon, and it was awesome. Super fresh and so many plentiful toppings! It was more toppings than salad, and it was very yummy.  All in all, a great place to get delivery from or stop in for a quick lunch or dinner.

Sure the price is low but the quality of the massage was so bad that I would have been better off sitting at home. I asked for a medium pressure with a lot of kneading massage. I got a lot of painful pinching (she kept thinking my bones were knots) and  forearm rubs, but not much kneading and no relaxation. My back hurt the next day. Overall, a fail - save your money and go someplace else.

The thrill of having a whole menu to order from! Yummy little vegetarian place tucked away in a sort of ugly strip mall, and worth the trip. The salads are very large, and unsurprisingly very green, fresh, and full of yummy toppings. The menu has healthy vegetarian options and unhealthy vegetarian options, so everyone can be pleased. I particular like the Mushroom Po'Boy, a really nice take on the normal (and getting boring) restaurant standard of a portabella sandwich. This Po'Boy is full of a savory and solid flavor. The pesto stir fry bowl is also really yummy, what vegetarian doesn't love pesto?

My husband & I had our wedding ceremony and reception at Desert Foothills and we highly recommend it to others looking for a beautiful unique venue to host their event. The day was absolutely perfect, a large part thanks to the wonderful help we received from Lisa (one of the event coordinators) and the staff. Lisa was available to help with suggestions and answers to all sorts of questions over the past year and was great at coordinating all the linens/chairs/catering/clean up/etc etc the day of the wedding so I had nothing to worry about.   We got our dinner catered through one of the vendors that has a partnership with Desert Foothills, Bobby Q, and the food was delicious.   The venue itself is strikingly beautiful - gorgeous red barn, fire pits, and saguaros lining the whole property. It really creates a wonderful backdrop for a memorable event.

Great little place for date night! LAMP Pizzeria definitely has the nicest "fancy" pizza in the Cave Creek/North Scottsdale area. It's wood fired and they use quality ingredients. Is it the best pizza I've every had, or even in the Top 5? No, but for the area, it's a fantastic choice and I definitely will be bringing family who visit here and going back for dinners with my husband.   The white wine sangria was fun and came full of fruit (grapes & oranges). I really liked the Grape & Gorgonzola salad because it was big, fresh, and filling. My husband and I split The Simple pizza and really liked it - good crust, good sauce, good cheese, good olive oil. Two drinks each, a salad, and a pizza runs about $50.  The place is cute. We sat outside, and though it's in a strip mall, the patio is in a courtyard setting with big string lights above. Wish they could get misters out there for the summer, but they have heat lamps for cooler nights. The courtyard faces west so you can see the sky change colors as the sun sets. The only bummer is that they don't have cocktails, but there is a place right next door that serves those.

I really like the concept of Tap Haus and wish they could have executed it better. The bar area has a ton of beers on tap, with a lot of local choices, which is awesome. The inside is nice and would be a good place to hang out with friends. However whoever set up the taps & kegs made some sort of mistake or the volume of customers Tap Haus gets is too low because our beers were all flat. Like flat flat. And then it took forever to get the bartender's attention to get new beers. Service is another issue here - we came in on a Saturday around 5 pm for beers & appetizers. The restaurant was empty, with about 5-8 people at the bar. There were tons of servers just standing around, doing nothing, since there was no one dining. None of them pitched in to help the 1 bartender. Once we finally got new beers, his was better (perhaps the tap tube just needed to be flushed) but mine was still kind of flat. I got a different beer...which was kind of flat too. After that we gave up, finished our beers and french fries, and left.

I do really want to support local businesses near home, but this place is just all wrong. Prices are high relative to the quality of food, service is poor, the interior is dark, and MY BEER WAS FLAT. Seeing as how beer is in the name of the place, to serve flat beer and then the inane response of 'it's a light beer, it's supposed to taste that way' I got from our server when I asked for a different one. I know what a Coors Light is supposed to taste like and my draft beer was definitely very flat. Never happened to me before in my life and now twice in Arizona.  The food is sub par and seems really over priced for being sub par. I had the $10 chopped veggie salad which was a small bowl (I thought they accidentally brought me a side salad) of  the Costco kind of white iceberg lettuce with carrot shavings. It was supposed to come with cheese and avocado however mine didn't arrive with it. It took a good number of minutes to get a server's attention to fix it. The burgers are okay sized. My fiance had the BBQ burger and again, wherever they are sourcing their ingredients from sucks. The BBQ sauce was sickly sweet and ketchup tasting as opposed to a good bold smokey flavor.  I won't be returning here nor would I recommend it to anyone else. It was so bad we left at half time during the game we came to watch to find a different sports bar.

Studio Movie Grill is the first class cabin for movie theaters. Buying a reserved seat online is like flying with premium status. I'm never going to a normal movie theater again! So you can buy a reserved seat online for like $2 extra per ticket which means no waiting in line for a seat during the opening weekend and guaranteed good seating. You have to pick up the ticket will call which also has no line because they will service people with reserved tickets before anyone trying to buy a ticket in person. The seats are comfy and you get to order food and drinks!  The popcorn is awesome - full, big kernels covered in normal movie theater butter. Definitely tasted fresher and of a higher quality than most theater popcorn which always seems really stale and the shape of the kernels is big & round instead of the normal popcorn shape. The cheese fries are awesome - excellent seasoned fries covered in nacho cheese & ranch dressing. The fries themselves are really high quality - texture of beer battered fries with seasoning so it's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The seven layer chocolate cake is amazing - thick, moist, and oh so chocolaty. After the movie they give out dinner mints to everyone which is a very nice touch.  I really am never going to a normal movie theater again. Reserved seating and food and drink service is the way to go.

Oh my delicious! My husband and I had an amazing lunch at Distrito and I cannot wait to go back. We came in at 11:30 on Friday with a reservation and there were just a few other people in the restaurant. We had attentive and prompt service, quickly getting seated, drinks, and food. We were in, stuffed, and out in 50 minutes. The lunch special is out of this world and I hope it never goes away. For $15 you get a full sized app and entree of Distrito's amazing food. As a vegetarian, this was one of the best Mexican meals I've ever had. The flavors were so fresh, interesting, and satisfying. I had:  - Guacamole: Of course this is hard to mess up and Distrito's is spot on creamy, fresh, and bright.  - Nachos: This could be a meal in itself. I found the red sauce to be a little too spicy for me, but it mellowed out when mixed in with the plentiful cheese and some guacamole from the other appetizer. Solid dish. - Chili Relleno: Highlight of my meal! The red sofrito sauce was out of this world - so many complex & layered flavors, and such a complement to the pepper and quinoa. It's hard to describe but it's a warm, smoky, savory, spicy sauce. The quinoa was barely noticeable in a good way - very soft and almost buttery. Quinoa at home never tastes that good! I LOVED the black beans that came with the dish too - very flavorful (cumin I think) and good. The crumbling of mexican cheese over the dish gave it the perfect salty touch. This is an amazing entree for a vegetarian.

Brat Haus is so cute! Sit on the patio (ample picnic bench seating), enjoy the beautiful Phoenix weather, drink a big beer, place bar games, and have fun!   The food is fine. We got the pretzels & cheese fondue, which was pretty good. The pretzels came out really fast so they are clearly prepared well ahead of time, which is reflected in the texture (harder and tougher than the soft pillow homemade pretzel I was hoping for) but the cheese sauce far & away makes up for that! It's awesome, enough said. There are a few vegetarian options, but not a lot which is probably to be expected from a menu that says "swine dining". I had the shaved raw salad and enjoyed it.  I highly recommend visiting the Brat Haus for some beer & fun. It really is a great outdoor patio to relax at.

Yummo, not sure why this place has such lackluster reviews, because the pizza was awesome and the beer list extensive! I like the location next to Desert Ridge because parking is easy and it's a nice quiet area. The pizza menu has a ton of vegetarian options, which is a big bonus.   I absolutely love the Gourmet White pizza. The crust is amazing - thin for the pizza topping area and super thick, moist, & dense (but in a very pleasing way) for the crust portion. The flavors of this pizza are so spot on - garlicky and cheesy, exactly how it's described. I think getting the medium or large size, instead of the small or personal size, makes the proportion of thick crust better. The Kosmic Karma pizza is okay - I found the vegetable toppings to be a little lackluster...I hate when the tomato area gets all soggy which plagues this pizza, but the pesto sauce swirl is yummy.  Service is hit or miss...I've been here for work lunches where our order was taken quickly and the food came out quickly, and other times where that wasn't the case. The prices are a little bit higher than other pizza places, but Mellow Mushroom does have a higher quality of toppings and pizza combinations.

Fantastic place for a healthy & quick meal. I've gotten take out and catered work lunches from Cafe Zupa, and I've been very happy with everything. The menu has a lot of choices, included vegetarian friendly options, the food is fresh, portions are large, and it's inexpensive.   I really like their salads, which are actually large enough to make a meal out of. Bonus that they include a roll of bread and chocolate covered strawberry. The Kale Quinoa is my favorite, because it's savory, healthy, and has a nice kick from the berries without being too sweet. The vegetarian sandwich is solid, and the pesto aioli makes it a little more interesting than the normal cheese/tomato/lettuce you can get stuck with otherwise.  The desserts are soooo good. My favorite is the salted caramel brownie but they are all good.

Awesome place tucked away off Mill for healthy and satisfying vegetarian food. The people working there were so nice and helpful as well. The menu isn't huge but it's easy to get variety from the different flavors of hummus and different sides available. I loved the maple mustard hummus (weirdest sounding combination, but so dang good) and the lentil wrap. My lunch was filling enough to last me until dinner, which is hard to find with vegan/vegetarian food. I love the small patio with bougainvillea.

Fate Brewery is a great addition to Arizona's local breweries. The combination of yummy fresh food plus beer is awesome, and when you can add cake pops to the mix, well it's hard to put all that happiness in words. The brewery restaurant itself is nice - lots of light, outdoor seating with a garage-type door that opens out onto a patio, view of the brewing cask/tanks, and warm soothing colors. We had:  - Garlic Pizza: Damn good! Flavorful garlic olive oil sauce, lots of cheese, and fresh basic and tomatoes. The crust is really good. - House Salad: Always impressive when a place that serves beer can also make a good salad. Lots of cheese and other toppings, and everything was fresh. - The Beer: Pretty good. I was a little disappointed in the Cream Ale because I was expecting a luscious creamy beer, but it wasn't. In fact I thought the Hefe was way more creamy.   Overall, Fate Brewery is a great place to go with friends or a date or coworkers. The people working there all seemed really nice, and we had a good time there.

Hacienda's is a nice restaurant, hidden and tucked into a strip mall.  We came for HH and had great service and enjoyed the food. We had:  - Queso Fundido: It arrived and I initially cringed because it looked like that bright orange, processed nacho cheese stuff which I really don't like...but something they did to it made it taste so good! There was fresh spinach and tomatoes added in, and some kind of spice added in. The classic potato chips it was served with were perfect with the dip. - Sopes: Yum! Filling and tasty. The actual sope by itself was a little dry but with all the flavorful toppings it was overall very good. - Margaritas: Now we got non-HH margaritas and though it was GIANT (I mean like the size of my head), there was barely any tequila in it. It tasted like sweet/sour mix and no one wants to drink that much mixer...My draft beer on the other hand was very good.   Most of the people in the restaurant were an older age, which attests to the good prices :) I can attest to yummy food.

I was all set to love this place because of it's awesome set up (indoor/outdoor bar) & relaxed atmosphere, but then my salad came. If I had only drank here, I am sure my review would be 4 or 5 stars primarily because they can open up all the walls so it's a completely open air bar which is perfect for Arizona. The menu is small but has lots of good pub grub on it, but I wasn't too hungry so I ordered a salad. My friends' food came out before mine and their sandwiches and burgers looked great - upscale toppings, cheeses, thick breads, nice presentation, etc. The french fries are yummy and come with great dipping sauces.  Then my salad was brought out. It was a salad you buy from Wendy's or other such fast food places, still in a disposable black bowl with the clear disposable top. The lettuce was dry, there were a couple of tomatoes, a few slices of cucumber, a sliced hard boiled egg, and that was it! The menu listed carrots, radishes, onion, and smoked cheddar as ingredients but none of that was on it. I mean, COME ON, put it on a real plate and give me all the ingredients or don't serve it at all.

I came in to get a manicure and pedicure for my wedding. The lady who did my nails and the other ladies working there were really nice, but it doesn't make up for the poor results I received, especially since she knew I was getting married in a few days and my hands would be on extra display.  So while she was doing my nails she missed the sides of each nail, which I had to point out. She only did one coat on top of the missed sections so it ended up a lot lighter than the rest of my nails. She originally was only going to do two coats of the nail polish but it was incredibly splotchy looking so I asked her to do an additional one. She really should have known to do that. After finishing the top coat, she sprayed some stuff on my hands. She said it was cuticle spray and that it would help my nails dry fast. I thought, how fantastic. After getting home I see that the spray made the surface of my nails bubble up like a bunch of tiny little bumps...it was awful looking. My nails chipped within 3 days. Worst manicure ever.  My pedicure was better but she turned off the massage chair half way through claiming she was afraid it was going to overheat. I certainly don't want to cause a fire but would have liked to enjoy it for my full pedicure.  Anyways, given the fact that the lady knew it was my wedding nails and she did such a poor job definitely makes me never want to come in here again or recommend it to anyone.

My fiance & I got Groupons for 3 horse riding lessons at Twisted Tree Farm. The stables themselves are very pretty and set into a calm area of North Scottsdale with views of Pinnacle Peak. It'd be a really cute place to take engagement or family pictures, if they let you. Twisted Tree Farm caters to real riders, like the kind that do jumps and that sort of competition. We didn't quite realize that when we got the groupons...my fiance trying to post and such was a funny site. We just wanted to learn how to ride horses and get to run with them cause trail guides on the hour rides in the desert never let you. Our instructor Victoria was really nice, knowledgeable, and patient. She let me go slowly (those horses are giant) and made sure I felt comfortable with everything.   Twisted Tree Farms seems like a great place to go if you want to learn english-style, jump-style horse riding. If you are just looking for regular horse riding lessons like we were, someplace else would probably be better.

I used to frequent Legends when it went by Coach & Willies. Not much has changed about the place though I no longer see the Dbombs drink advertised. Legends is a great place to get yummy food before or after a Diamondbacks game. I LOVE the Italian Nachos (pizza in nacho form...my god, genius). It's a nice clean bar with lots of wood, and a very nice outdoor patio with lots of bougainvillea and misters.

One of the best places to get really good & cheap food at PHX! They have a big selection of pizza slices to choose from, including vegetarian & vegan choices. And the food is actually really yummy. I had a slice of the margarita pizza, and if my eyes had been closed I would not have known it was airport food. The crust was light and thin, and it was full of a wonderful garlic basil flavor with lots of cheese. With prices like $6 for 2 slices and a drink, no wonder the Pizza Hut in the same row is empty.

This place is awesome for a healthy and delicious lunch! Prices are reasonable for how good and fresh the food is, and I find the portions to be spot on.  The  Danish salad is out of this world yummy! I don't really like the dressing but that's really easy to get on the side. The dates, currants, apple, blue cheese, almond combo is killer and delicious. The salads are definitely good-sized, but I like to get a carb-based side to go with it to make it truly filling. The $1.50 Quinoa side hits the spot.  Highly recommend having lunch here! Parking on the street can be impossible during the work week, but there is a large parking garage just a block away.

The namesake item, grilled cheese, was really disappointing but the tomato soup was pretty good. When it's $10 for a grilled cheese, I'm expecting thick bread with a nice crust on the outside and soft on the inside filled with plentiful ooey gooey cheese. Well this grilled cheese was none of that - very thin bread with a measly single slice of cheese half melted. It was so disappointing. The tomato soup was surprisingly good, sort of thick and chunky like a pasta sauce while still being soup.

Schaffer's is a great bridal salon. The store is big & clean and has huge dressing rooms. They carry a bunch of different wedding dress designers like Maggie Sottero, Pronovias, Sottero & Midgley, and Marchesa. The lady who helped me try on gowns, Karla, was great! She took the time to understand what I was looking for and pulled a great assortment of dresses in my price range. I would highly recommend Schaffer's to brides looking for wedding dresses.

I could eat every meal at Otro and never get tired of the food. Otro serves up big, unique flavors in a casual/comfy environment. Otro serves up especially good options for vegetarians. I've had:  - Otro Salad: Yum! Sort of like the kitchen sink of salads but everything tastes really good together and the large size is meal-worthy with a little something extra. - Arugula & Quinoa Salad: Solid Mexican flavors rounded out by the bite of arugula and the creaminess of avocado. It's more quinoa than a lettuce type salad. - Vegetable Tacos: One of the best tacos ever! The tortillas are soft & fresh. The filling is in-your-face-delicious - sort of like a mexican curry of flavors. - Guacamole: Really good but a little on the spicy side.

Bartlett Lake is a wonderful escape to a large (for Arizona) body of water with semi-sandy beaches that lets you feel like you're practically at the beach. Boats going by cause small ripples that make a lovely wave-like sound. The area is very pretty.  The downside is that it takes forever to get there (I live in Cave Creek and it was a good 40 minutes). The drive in is gorgeous, but time consuming. My husband & I came to check it out on a Saturday, with the intention of doing a hike around the lake. The ranger station was closed and the store where you purchase the $6 required parking pass did not have any trail maps. We started the Palo Verde trail (#512) which after a few minutes, mysteriously disappears. Just vanishes. We trekked around for a while trying to pick it back up, which was fun, but ended up having to return because there was so much cacti everywhere. The 5 minutes of the trail was very pretty, but I'd recommend getting to talk to a ranger/getting a map before going on it. Since the lake is very pretty, we just sat on the beach and read for a few hours. No real complaints, but it would have been nice to have been able to do the hike.

Great prices, fast & easy delivery, and good firewood. I was also able to request a large tree stump to use for a crafting project and really appreciated that the field supervisor called me to describe the appearance of a few different types of wood so I could select the best thing for my project.

We ended up at Moonshine because the next door Tavern on Mill was way too crowded and we wanted to eat and drink before a ASU game, and had a great time! The bar is cool - a nice outdoor patio area with tv's & a bar, and a big inside with a lot of tables, tv's, and open space. The feel is upscale country (fancier than the country bars in my home area of Cave Creek) and relaxed. You can order 32 oz beers and they come in giant mason jars, which is cute. The menu has a good offering of vegetarian items, which is always a plus and harder to find at country style bars. I had the goat cheese & fried tomato sandwich which was yummy and satisfying, and the fries are awesome (crispy beer battered outside, soft inside). On Saturday Game Days they have a great deal on wings (I think it was a pound for $5), but no drink specials.

I attended a work event at Bootleggers and think the restaurant did a great job setting up our group in the back room and setting up a buffet of good food. I really liked the mac & cheese which was al dente pasta with a cheesy sauce, with an extra layer of melted cheese on top. The fried pickles, battered with a seasoned coating like curly fries, were good too. They have many beers on draft, including local beers. The atmosphere is upscale country.

Sarah's Garden did the flowers for my wedding and they turned out absolutely gorgeous! Sarah was really nice and easy to work with and she took the time to understand the feeling and vibe of my wedding, the venue, the colors, and the kinds of flowers I liked. She then took my opinions and put together a wonderful visual inspiration board to double check she understood what we talked about. As a diy bride, it was a little hard for me to let someone else be in charge of doing something as important as the flowers but I really had no reason to worry...Sarah really knows what she is doing! The day of the wedding she dropped off our flowers to two different locations which was a great help. Our bouquets were absolutely amazing and helped make the day all that better!

Jena did an amazing job making me, my bridesmaids, and mom look beautiful for my wedding. Me & the ladies are all different shades of skin color and hair color and everyone looked fantastic, so Jena really knows what she is doing. She will travel to you for the big day, and works with a lady who does great wedding hair, which makes getting ready so much easier and more fun. My trial was great - she listened to what I wanted and tried out a few different things for me to pick what I liked best. My actual wedding day makeup was so pretty! It was easily the prettiest I've ever looked - Jena really knows how to bring out a person's best features. It also happened to be (unexpectantly) 95+ degrees that day for an outdoor wedding, and my makeup held up through the heat and lots of dancing.   With all the things a girl can get anxious about related to a wedding, it's great to be able to be confident that you will look your best. Choose Jena & you won't be disappointed!

Adorable little bakery for afternoon tea or a treat. I got the caramel shortbread (3 Euro) which was amazing. The shortbread was crumbly and the right level of saltiness to balance out the thick layer of chocolate and caramel, which more resembled butterscotch to me which I think is a really good thing. It was very hard to pick just one thing, everything looked amazing.

Dr. Lam & Chris are absolutely fantastic, and I definitely will continue to use Eye Care North and recommend them to others. The facility is new, bright, and most importantly feels very clean and has modern technology. Dr. Lam was so nice and never made me feel like I was taking (and failing) an exam. She explained everything and I feel very confident in her ability to spot and diagnose problems. Chris was also very nice, taking the time to help me pick out frames and made great suggestions based on things I liked. I love that I can schedule my appointment online and fill out my patient form ahead of time, making the process to go in and get out very efficient. Chris also made sure I knew what my coverage was for the exam based on my insurance ahead of time, which I appreciated very much. When I went back in to pick up my glasses, they greeted me by name and were so friendly and helpful, and even included a little treat. Eye Care North definitely defines what great customer service is.  The only thing that I had a hard time with was understanding the cost of my glasses, and I'm sure this is half due to insurance companies being hard to understand. VSP states typical co-pays on their website for all the different "add ons" like polarized, polymer, UV protection, etc. but Eye Care North groups it all together into various packages that include "free UV protection, scratch resistance, etc.". I ended up being really confused on what I needed and why it all ended up costing so much, which is partly due to my own lack of research but also partly due to the fact that Eye Care North groups it all together into lens packages without a breakdown. So I recommend people new to needing glasses to do some research ahead of time on what you really need and then come in prepared to be shocked at how much lenses cost even with insurance :)

Pizza is one of my top 3 favorite foods and I love it and eat a lot of it in all its forms - thin crust, thick crust, original crust, stuffed crust, rolled up into stromboli, folded up into a calzone...and Pomo Pizzeria has hands down the best Neapolitan pizza I've had in Arizona. My god everything is spot on fantastic and delicious! The crust is perfection - moist, chewy, perfectly crusted on the outside and soft on the inside, slightly smoky/charred from the wood fired oven. The tomato sauce is perfect - bright, flavorful, fresh. The cheese is great, the olive oil is great, the basil is great. And it all culminates into a perfect margarita pizza. I also had the Mango Salad which was fantastic. Lots of fresh arugla, lettuce to balance out the arugula, sharp blue cheese, and some just-ripe mango.   I can't wait to come back! Parking is easy and there is a wonderful outdoor patio that seats a good number of people. But sitting inside isn't bad either because of the open kitchen.

The Henry is a wonderful place! It feels fancy and upscale without being stuffy. It's a perfect place for date night, meeting with girlfriends, a work lunch/chat. I loved the design and atmosphere of the place.The menu has vegetarian and gluten-free options, and has interesting healthy options. My favorite item was the brown butter salted caramel roll, which is like a normal cinnamon roll but way better.

Three & a half stars overall. I recommend this Oregano's if you like Oregano's food and want to have a long meal outside. The food is the same quality as other Oregano's, and I happen to really really like Oregano's food. But the kitchen/service is soooo slow. I didn't mind it being so slow since I went in for lunch at 2:30 pm on a Sunday and was not in a rush, but it shouldn't have taken 1.5 hours to get and eat a meal...and I certainly wouldn't be into an 1.5 hour long meal during the work week. It took a good 45 minutes for our salads to even come out, which blows my mind because they weren't crowded with other diners.    The outdoor patio space is very nice, with picnic tables, nice lights, and mesquite trees to create a courtyard-type feel, but it's right on the main road without a wall to block sound so every motorcycle that guns on by is heard acutely. I always find Oregano restaurants to play their music way too loudly, and even the music doesn't drown out passing cars. They have two corn hole sets, so this location seems best fit for people hanging out, drinking a few beers, & having an appetizer instead of sitting down for a full meal.

My family and I had so much fun going paddle boarding on Bartlett Lake! We came in on a Saturday early afternoon without reservations, and were able to rent 3 beginner boards for an hour. There were a few other groups paddle boarding at the same time. The good news for beginners is you get to learn and start in a protected & calm area and then you can choose to go out onto the lake with the boats. It was my sister's first time and with a few minutes of explanation from Chad, she was up and standing. I was a little nervous about getting run over by a boat but as long as you hug the shoreline, there is little risk for that. However you can get some serious wake from boats...fun but make sure you're ready to fall in! It is an absolutely gorgeous way to experience the desert - the lake is surrounding by beautiful big boulder cliffs with cactus growing everywhere. We really had an awesome time.  Looking on their website, it seems that you do not have to pay the $6 Tonto parking fee if you are just going to the marina to rent paddle boards or kayaks. However you'll still have to stop into the little trailer that sells the parking passes to ask them to let you into the marina area.  This company has some really bad reviews from their Peoria location but we didn't experience any of the frustration experienced by other Yelpers (thank goodness). My only complaint is that the business could greet people who wander in because there is no real office storefront and we wandered around a while trying to figure out who to talk to about rentals. We ended up just waiting next to the big stack of boards for 20 minutes or so before someone asked us if we wanted to do stand up paddle boarding. After we were done I noticed the same thing happening to other groups. So if it's busy, just do the same and someone will help you eventually. It's worth a wait!

SumoMaya has such a cool atmosphere that I was ready to love it, but service and food fell so short of mediocre. I definitely would not come back here for a meal but probably enjoying some cocktails would be fine.  The service issues started when I first arrived, 15 minutes early for a noon reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty, but there were a lot of servers, and I requested a table on the patio which has all of 4 other people. I waited for everyone else to arrive and then at noon we asked to be seated. The hostess said she just seated someone out there (nope, still 4 people) so she had to wait a little before seating us. 10 minutes later we asked to be seated again and she said if we sat inside then she could seat us immediately, so we agreed to just sitting inside. We each ordered an entree but everything came out separately. And by separately I mean 5-6 minutes apart. I get bringing food out when it's ready if people are sharing dishes, but each person ordered their own meal (salad...not shareable food) and I go out to eat so I can eat with other people. If I wanted to eat my meal by myself, I would stay home.   Then the food just wasn't very good. I got the vegetarian chopped salad (one of the very few vegetarian options available) and I just did not like it - the greens were a little too hard, the mushrooms has a bad rubbery texture, and the smoke flavor was just awful.

Asado is absolutely a five-star worthy restaurant relative to other Cave Creek restaurants, and is a great addition to this area of town. To sum it up - fantastic service, a very nice ambiance/interior, great portions, great food, and inexpensive prices. The only downside to the meal were the cocktails, which were all too sweet, but that's easily fixed by sticking to beer or soft drinks in the future. I loved the complimentary table salsa, which was perfectly balanced, fresh, with just a hit of heat.  I don't remember the name of our waitress, but she was fantastic. After learning I was vegetarian, she took the time to check with the kitchen to find out what really was vegetarian and not. Turns out items that would be easy to think are vegetarian are not, and she was happy to help with suggesting other options that would work for me. For other vegetarians the green sauce, red sauce, and rice are not vegetarian. We had:  - Bean & Cheese Chimichanga with Fundido Sauce: Yummo and so much food (two meals)! The fundido sauce was the vegetarian sub instead of red/green sauce, and it was really good. Pretty hard to not like cheese sauce. I added the fresh table salsa to brighten and lighten it up. I would happily order this again. - Guacamole: This was fine. I probably wouldn't order it again because the complimentary salsa was so good, but it was fine guacamole. - Green Chili Burrito: My husband had this and though it was really good. He loved the stew-like filling. - Strawberry Margarita: Typical frozen machine margarita with way too much sugar. Definitely not worth getting again. - Sangria: Also too sweet and not very refreshing. Besides an orange wedge and maraschino cherry, it was a wine cooler. - Elderflower Mule: Though the flavors were interesting and good (sort of tasted like a spa treatment), it was too too sweet. - Chopped Salad: Refreshing and satisfying as a lighter meal option. Great dressing, and lots of cheese and avocado as salad toppers.  I definitely will be back to Asado, whether for eating in or picking up take out. I'm really glad such a good offering with reasonable prices has come to Cave Creek.

Such a cool place to grab a meal or happy hour. The atmosphere is always lively, but it works for a work lunch too (not rowdy, quick service, and tons of tables). The menu doesn't have a ton of vegetarian options but the few they have (pasta, salad) or that you can make vegetarian (burgers without the meat) are good.  I especially like the corn and mushroom cannelloni, which is an awesome vegetarian entree. The flavors are complex and satisfying, and the dish is filling on it's own without an appetizer or salad. The salads are decent sized, but I find I usually need something extra to make it a meal (some cheese and crostini from the tapas menu, a side of fries).

This place is awesome! Great atmosphere, great food, and a good beer list. The inside is well lit with a lot of natural light and there are a lot of TVs so you can watch a game from anywhere. The outside patio area has a good number of tables, and the parking lot/shopping mall it's next too wasn't too busy while we ate on Saturday at lunch.  The menu and food really stands out. My husband got the shepherds pie, which was gigantic and so good. I got the beet salad, which was so fresh, flavorful, and high quality. It wasn't big enough to make a meal of, but that's the only complaint.   Definitely recommend this spot, even if you only want food and aren't drinking.

Love the concept and the food is fantastic! I've only gotten take out from here but the restaurant atmosphere is very nice so it would be a great place to dine in. The menu has a lot of variety so there should be something for everyone.  I love the Winter Sunshine salad with roasted sweet potato, grains, and bright citrus. It tastes great, is satisfying, and feels healthy. The Organic Smashed Potatoes are everything you want mashed potatoes to be (warm, soft, and so comforting) but taken up a notch than what most of us make at home with subtle garlic and rosemary.   This is a great choice, and especially great for people at Scottsdale Shea hospital (healthy food that beats the hospital cafeteria).

Such an awesome location to grab a drink and sit outside! The food menu is small but the drink menu is expansive. I was pleasantly surprised to see that crowd skewed a little older (30s, 40s) for Mill on a Saturday night. The outdoor picnic tables, games, many tables (no fighting or waiting to get a seat!), and fire pit are perfect for setting up and enjoying a relaxed few hours.
