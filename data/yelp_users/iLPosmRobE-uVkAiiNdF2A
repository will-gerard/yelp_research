I would rate it 0 stars but that's not possible. Every time I have come here I have been treated badly. Gave the dj $15 on an extremely slow Sunday to play a song. The night ended and he never played the song. When I asked for my money back, essentially was told to f**k off. Only good thing about this place is the taco truck connected to it. Other than that, I plan on avoiding this place like and STD, which you might get simply by waking in.

I've heard so many phenomenal things about this restaurant. Friends and family rave about how awesome the concept is, and how great the food is. One day, I drove out of the way from where I live to come try this place out. Needless to say I was very excited. Unfortunately that excitement ended the minute I waited in line to order. The cashier who was working at 3:30pm April 19th was insanely rude. The guy in front me pointed on a picture near the cash register and said he wanted his meal exactly like this. The cashier was very short with him, and kept asking him what he wanted. They finally figured it out, and he customer apologized for not knowing exactly what he wanted. He payed and was told in a very short and rude tone "Go sit over there. We will bring it you you."  Now it was my turn to order. I said I wanted the combination plate with the quesadilla and burrito. The cashier told me "Ok, what do you want." I again said the the burrito and quesadilla with beans and rice. Once again, he was insanely rude once again. "Yeah, again, what do you want". I was so confused. Being this was my first time in, I wasn't sure the best way to order. He goes, "You get two items, what items do you want". Again I had no idea what he was talking about and expected I would be told what items I could chose from. NOPE! Nothing but attitude and poor customer service. He was so rude, I at this point refused to give my money to such a disrespectful person, so I left and sadly ended up going to jack and a box. Something I for sure I didn't want to have.   I was so bummed and upset by the lack of customer service I was receiving from this poor cashier. If I was his employer, I would be embarrassed and ashamed by this guy. I've worked in food and beverage for 9 years, and I know how good customer service is given. And this man was by far he rudest person I have dealt with in ANY established.  This employee should be fired as he represented this company so badly. I don't know if I will try this place out after having such a poor taste in my mouth before even taking a bite out of the food.

Excellent food, with horrific service. Came here with a couple friends and my boyfriend for lunch one Sat. Like a previous review stated, the hostess was very gracious and kind, but that's where it stops. Our service was very shotty. Our server seemed to have absolutely no interest on giving us good service since we weren't dropping hundreds on lunch buying bottle waters or drinking wine or alcohol. Ordered and Iced tea and not once did anybody offer a refill for my tea. I shouldn't have to wave you down to refill my ice tea. 2 of my friends wanted to share an appetizer and an entree and was straight up told by our server that it wasn't allowed. Our server was very rude. He only came to our table to take our order and drop off our check. This place seemed so promising but due to the service of one server, this place came off very pretentious. Maybe if the staff/server spent less time on their iPhones and more time taking care of their guests,  I could give this place another try next time I was in Vegas. But I can assure u I will NEVER go or suggest this place ever again. U shouldn't leave feeling like u were looked down upon when you was choose to spend my hard earned money on the establishment.

My lens of my glasses fell out and went missing one night, and immediately began to worry, cause without my glasses, I'M BLIND! I work at the Scottsdale Quarter, so I dropped off my glasses to get repaired. Unfortunately, they had to order my lens and have it shipped to the store. I would have to wait a week to get my glasses fully repaired. THIS SUCKS, I thought. But to help calm my nerves, Stephanie, who was PHENOMENAL btw, had them place a temporary lens on my glasses, until my correct lens came in. She even walked from from their store to my place of employment, just so that I would not have to walk in the heat to pick up my glasses. Simply amazing customer service. My home store is in Scottsdale fashion square, but I may start coming to this location.  THANKS GUYS! :)
