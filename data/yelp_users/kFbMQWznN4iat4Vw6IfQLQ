The fried appetizers were good in flavor but were soggy and were dripping with grease.  I think the veggies were frozen.  I got the lighter side grilled chicken which tasted a little funny and the grilled veggies were super dry.  I also think the ice tea was instant because it didn't taste fresh.  Our server was really nice, though, which is the only reason I'm giving this place two stars.

I have been meaning to get my hair cut for a while but I've been apprehensive.  I used to have a great stylist in Glendale an was wanting the same pride in workmanship.  I went to a different salon on this side of town but didn't like it very much. The shop was really nice it's just that my stylist didn't listen to what I asked for.  I decided to try Pure Elements because it was new and the reviews are really good.  I called to see if there were any openings and the had one for thirty minutes after I called.  I took an appointment with Lexi.  I hope that's how you spell her name.  But she was awesome!  A real joy to talk to and she did everything I asked with my hair.  Ben when she was finished she asked how I liked it and I had a minor change but she took care of it immediately.  I absolutely love my hair cut!!!!

Best McDobalds I've ever been to. There fries are always fresh. They have messed up my order only once but they knew right away when I went through the drive thru.  All other McDonalds are ruined for me.

Pretty good. I've never had any complaints about this subway.

I came in for the first time a week ago.  We weren't dressed to impress because my boyfriend and I had never been here before. I'm not sure if this was a reflection on our waitress but she gave us terrible service.  She spent more time attending to the group of males in suits than to my boyfriend and me.  We were there for a long time before she even took out sink order.  My boyfriend was drinking beer and it was like pulling teeth for him to get a refill.   The food was really great.  I recommend the bone in fillet or the chicken.  Both are great. The AG mashed potatoes are like a twice baked potato that is super yummy.  I really enjoyed the saut√©ed asparagus too. They were crisp and buttery.   I took my parents to this restaurant a few days ago.  The food was still delicious but the wait staff was very slow.   I think the wait staff is my only complaint about this place.  The food is really good. Oh and the cheesecake was delicious too.

Pull pork sandwich with Mac and cheese and potato salad.  All were very tasty!  I tried some of my dad's sampler plate.  The sausage that came with it was delicious and the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I will definitely be coming back to try more off of the menu.

This was my first time coming to this establishment.  I tried the lemon pepper chicken and loved it.  It was nice and tender and very easy to chew.  The macaroni salad was also great.  I will definitely come back to this place to get my lemon pepper fix.  It wasn't over powering with lemon flavor like I've had a other places, which made it even more tasty.

I'm only giving this place two stars because I used to love it. I moved in the area about a year ago. That was the first Time I tried this place. It was awesome! It was my new Italian joint. So we would go there at least once a month.  When I stated school everything got busy do I couldn't go as often. I missed their mozzarella sticks so we went back. I don't know if they got new management or their standards have dropped but everything we got was way too overcooked.  The mozzarella sticks were so burned the cheese was leaking out of them. Also the dish I got had red sauce which tasted like it was straight from the can. I'm sad I used to love this place but I haven't been back there since this happened 2 months ago.

The best oatmeal cookies I have ever tasted in my life.  I am an official addict.  The far chocolate peanut butter oaties are me favorite.  The white chocolate macadamia nut ones are also phenomenal!  Try them, now! Delicious!!!!!  Oh, one last thing the sundae's are really good too!

Kevin and Glen were spectacular.  I bought my friend a ride for her birthday and she was gracious enough to bring me along.  It was totally worth it!  The crew was very friendly and extremely knowledgable on hot air balloons.  I was a bit nervous but it was all put to ease because these guys were entertaining and professional.  If I get up the gumption to do this again I will definitely go with these guys.   The four person balloon seemed much nicer than those larger balloons, considering it was just me and my friend going.  We met a very nice couple too, that joined us in the balloon.  Kevin's stories were great and he knew so much.    Definitely give these guys a try, it's worth every penny!

I LOVE this place!  I come in whenever I get the chance.  I love the style of this place.  It reminds me of a Chipotle by the way you order your food.  I usually get the chicken pesto pizza which is very delicious and just add mushrooms.  The dough has a hint of sweetness to it that makes the crust very tasty.  They are quick with your order too.  I can usually finish 3/4 of my pizza if I'm super hungry.  All in all I like this place very much.  The atmosphere is lovely and the location is ideal.

I have been looking for waxing services close to my house.  I live in north Peoria so it's hard to find a location with great reviews.  I found Heather here and read a great review.  I decided to make the appointment and try her out.  I got a Brazilian wax, which I am not new to, and it was the quickest wax I've ever received.  I was in and out in under 30 minutes.  The results are great too.  Absolutely no hair and very little pain.  I will definitely be coming back for follow up sessions.  I highly recommend Heather, she's the best!

Amazing store. I went in to try and build a Magic deck. I have barely started playing so I know hardly anything about it. I was asked questions by the guy at the front, I feel terrible for not knowing his name. He was so very helpful. He built me an awesome deck which I know will help me defeat opponents. They also have some amazing art work on the walls which I had to purchase. I highly recommend this place and I will be going back in the future.
