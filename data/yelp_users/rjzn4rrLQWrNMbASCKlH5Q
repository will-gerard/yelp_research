Worst customer service I have ever experienced (only go if your a male). The two women who were working were gossiping about hooking up with men, while cutting these two children's hair. I told her I wanted a few high lighs to freshen my look for a wedding. That I was trying to get my hair healthy so I dont want a bunch. The woman was not friendly at all but i figured oh well its Supercuts. Once she finished putting highlights in I was spun around and saw she had put tons of right lights in. She announced it would be 85 dollars. I told her I would not pay. That if I wanted a 85 dollar color job I would have gone to my regular salon. She told me to go to the sink. Rinsed my hair aggressively and told me to leave. Refusing to give me a towel and in front of other customers just said ok leave. Will never go back. Thought I would save a few dollars and get 4-5 high lights before a wedding. Ended up spending 160 to get my tye-dyed hair fixed the next morning and missed my best friends wedding rehearsal. RUDE salon.. Just pay 85 and go to a nice salon that will pamper you.

This place is a joke.  I placed a togo order on a Sunday so when they told me it would be an hour I figured ok lots of football business. The kid who dropped off my order first told me the price. I paid him then hands me my pizza and soda. He started walking away. I had to announce that I didnt get my wings. His response was "Oh, Did you want them?" Ummm yeah dude why would I order them. I asked for the money back and how much they where and subtracted it for him.  I called GUS to inform them, a manager was put on the phone. She had the vocab of a high schooler. Her response was "Well Its not like he was trying to be rude or anything, he would have come back to get them and bring them back to you." Then she says they dont do refunds. All I have to say is Really lady.  Anyways. There service sucks.  I opened my pizza and its cold. Dont you think if its an hr wait maybe you should cook the pizza closer to the pick up time.  Never again! I would rather have frozen pizza!

I had my first bikini wax here. I was really nervous but Katie was really nice and did a great job. I have been back many times for eyebrows and will continue to get bikini waxes.

This gym is clean!  Its open feeling and has windows everywhere.  The staff is very friendly and knows your name.  The machines are new and not out dated. If your new to the work out scene the trainers are super friendly and are willing to teach. Its not overly crowded and because of the higher price there aren't a bunch of creepy people lurking around.  The theatre room is amazing!
