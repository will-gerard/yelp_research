I don't understand the negative reviews for Courtney Village. I live on the 4848 side and I can't complain about it. Occasionally, if not often, our neighbors upstairs (family with kids) make much noise but that just comes with apartment living. Guest parking is very limited so when you have guests over it can be difficult for them to find parking. Other than that, I can't complain. It's quiet, pretty safe and everyone who lives here seems like honest, hard working people who want a quiet, safe community. The trash service comes with the lease and it is clearly stated in the lease when you sign so I don't know why other Yelpers are complaining about the $25 fee. Apartments definitely feel cozy and spacious. Our electric isn't crazy either (SRP) as the apartment seems to have excellent insulation. Noise can be heard outside because the community is so quiet. I would recommend my friends to live here. However I plan to buy a house next year so I will miss Courtney Village when that time comes.

I love this place. Antipasto salad and a glass of red wine is my favorite meal. Everything from the pizza, salads and sandwiches are amazing. I'm the biggest Arnold Palmer drink fan and this place just knows how to serve it. The staff is always friendly and will go above to make sure your visit is great. Out of the 500+ restaurants in Phoenix, Nello's is my favorite. I call it, "The Italian mother I never had restaurant." They are only open until 10pm so make sure you arrive early in the evening. If you want to continue drinking after dinner, Zipps is right next door!

The worst credit union on planet earth! First they applied a payment to my auto loan that was mailed in towards the wrong account. I called them three times and they said they never received the check. I got confirmation check was cashed by them. Even after telling the rep this, he told me they did not receive a check. I had to miss work time to call and talk to them. One rep told me I needed to visit a branch to figure it out. Hello? You have like two branches and they close by 5, no weekends. I finally go to the branch- made the manager research while I waited and then he found the check. It was applied to another member's account! No accountability. Next, I lost my job and needed a deferment on my auto loan for one month. I had gotten a new job but start date was two weeks out. I asked them about a deferment and they told me no we do not do those. I've never been late ever until I lost my job. Then they transferred me to loss mitigation and the rep in that department told me she was going to have to close my credit card in order to consider the hardship deferment. I ended up withdrawing from my 401k to get money to make the two payments due. They will lend you credit but they will make it difficult to help you when need. I'm looking to refinance my auto loan just to get away from them. I'm waiting to hear from two lenders right now.

If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked in on a busy Friday night and within ten seconds I nearly slipped on their sticky floor. Fortunately I caught myself and didn't fall onto their nasty floor. As soon as that happen I got told by their bouncer I needed to leave because I appeared too drunk. I tried to explain to him what happened and the fact that I almost fell but he insisted I leave and not come back. I hadn't even drank anything yet. If this is how they want to do business then fine, I'll spend my money at other bars on Mill which I did.

I highly recommend this place. I had gone to a different piercing shop in Chandler and they pierced a labret stud way too small for my lip size. My lip started bleeding and bruising severely. The shop in Chandler was of no help nor did they seem to care about my situation. They suggested I just take the piercing out on my own and that "probably my body was rejecting it." I was puzzled and decided to get a second opinion. I went to HTC. They took control the situation and replaced the stud that was of insufficient length. I can't thank HTC enough for all their help! They took control and assured me I will be okay. Kudos to the two guys who work there- I don't remember their names. For my unfortunate situation, they gave me a discount on the piercing they had to correct. I recommend anyone to see them for all your piercing needs. They are awesome!

I love this store! Most Safeway locations are always great but this location stands out. The staff is friendly and helpful. The store is very clean especially in the produce and meat area. I hate shopping at Walmart and I make the drive across the freeway to shop here for groceries. I'm the kinda guy willing to pay more for better service, quick checkouts and friendly staff. Lately, the store has had some very great specials and most times their sales beat other store's ads. I can get what I need and still only spend around $20. I had to praise this store for it's friendliness, cleanness and that small town grocery store feeling. The staff remembers its customers and that just adds a nice touch to every shopping experience. Thank you Safeway for your commitment to your customers and always providing the best experience.

This place is the closest shopping center to my house. I come here on a weekly basis for H&M and American Eagle. I also LOVE Yardhouse's Monday night happy hour during the games, so its great to come here if your looking for a happy hour with the guys. Another place I'm a frequent shopper is Whole Foods, which is totally convenient if your already here shopping. I've also been to Blue Martini with an industry friend and we got 1/2 off all martini's for the night, which was a great deal. I recommend coming to this place despite others reviews, its a pretty chill place to go with good music.   Over in all, this is a great shopping center for southwest Las Vegas. I would recommend anyone to spend a couple hours at Town Square.

My family loves this place and we always eat here when they are in town. Portions and plates are big! You will need a to-go box. The service is great and friendly! I have never had a bad experience. Since moving to Tempe from Mesa, I haven't been visiting this location lately but I have done so about a month ago. The breakfast is my favorite and is served all day. I have gone out at 7 pm in the evening to have breakfast with my mom here. The bear claws that they sell in their pastry shelves are delicious. Be sure to share with someone as they are pretty big. I believe they also sell pies to-go. I would recommend this spot for breakfast, lunch or dinner if you're in the area.

I absolutely love this place. I had been stuck with the flu and needed something spicy and tasty to help with being decongestant. My friend and I had found this place on our drive to Chandler Mall. We were not sure where to eat and I just happen to see this establishment as we passed Rural and Chandler Blvd. I am sure glad we stopped here! I ordered their fresh rolls with shrimp that is freshly prepared. The fresh rolls with served with a sauce that tasted very similar to peanut butter; it must try! For the main entree, I ordered the spicy fried rice but asked to make it Thai hot. I was sick with the flu but managed to eat my entire meal. I had went with my friend who is Thai and she was even impressed with the dishes. I recommend to anyone with taste buds! We will be returning soon as I believe for February through March, they are offering 15% off your check on Sundays.

Excellent place for happy hour any day of the week or all day Sunday. I love this place and the staff has become familiar with me as I'm a regular customer. Prices for happy hour are very competitive and their drinks outdo many other bars in the area. I very much enjoy their half off appetizers and infused sake. I can't complain because as busy as they get during happy hour our server assures to get whatever we need. Geisha is a must try if you're in the area and looking for an excellent happy hour! Happy hour is 3-7 everyday and all day Sunday.

Mediocre food especially their steaks. I don't know what has happened to this place but it sure has gone downhill. Meat and sides taste just okay and overpriced considering the really mediocre food. I'm sad to say this is my last visit to this place. I will go to a real steakhouse next time.   I tried the country fried steak and it was pretty much no meat with just all breaded fat fried with gravy on top. The entire plate was just soaked with meat fat. I was really disappointed.  Two stars instead of one because of the bread and peanuts.

How can you go wrong with Chipotle?! I've always enjoyed this place and their fast, quick service. I use the Chipotle app during lunch hour to avoid the lines. Order on your app, choose to pay at the store and go straight to the register. However, sometimes I do visit this location spur of the moment. Not only is their staff fast and friendly but the food has always been excellent. I prefer the burrito bowls and tacos. I would consider Chipotle inexpensive but some may argue with me on that. However, I think you get what you pay for and at Chipotle they definitely serve some goodness! I always recommend Chipotle especially this location's service. Order all four salsas to give your burrito that extra kick!

Great place! Love their yogurt selection and the ability to taste before you choose. It's a very quiet and trendy spot to grab some yogurt. I think what I like most is you don't see 100 children here all backing up the yogurt machines. I've had my unpleasant experiences at Yogurtland so I definitely appreciate this location. The cashier is always friendly. Remember to check in here and get 25% off your purchase.  I wish I could come here more often but when I do make my evening walks at Tempe lake, I always try to stop in on my way out.

I absolutely love this dealer! I purchased my Nissan in 2012 and have had most of my services done here. I have visited another Nissan dealer and a local auto shop in between and neither one of them could match the excellent service that Larry Miller provides. I appreciate the honesty that the advisors provide. I used to be scared of rolling into a dealer's service department because most of them try to get you to do jobs that are not needed. However, Larry Miller Nissan is honest and educates their customers on the importance of car maintenance without breaking the wallet. I plan to buy another Nissan simply because I don't wanna deal with other shops and I would rather continue to visit Larry Miller for all my car maintenance needs.

My friends chuckle when I say I need to do my "weekly grocery" shopping at Total Wine. Some call it alcoholic, I call it great hospitality and being prepared when friends come over which is almost on a daily basis. First off, Total Wine should be your first stop for any alcohol and they usually can beat most prices. I have been buying vodka and mixers here for awhile now and still save money over Walmart. They have liquors from here and far away and the staff is quite friendly. I have grown accustom to seeing the staff and I'm sure the feeling is mutual. I don't have any complaints about Total Wine other than their ID verification process. I have been visiting this place for over two years now but they still log my ID information and have to call over a manager for approval. I understand they are probably abiding by the law but it holds up the line and draws attention from other customers.

Horwitz Vision Center has been my eye doctor for over 8 years now since I moved to Phoenix. I only wear contacts and they are experts in making sure you wear the best contacts. I have been wearing the same brand for 5 years now as they recommended the best contacts for my eyes. If you need an exam, be prepared to book an appointment in a week or so as they are busy. A busy vision center means it has to be one of the best vision centers in the valley. They have always given me a great experience and I intend to keep them as my eye doctor for many years to come!

Wow, what can I say? I'm definitely a member of the Dutch Mafia because of this location's great service and coffee. Every morning I have stopped here, the staff is upbeat and excited to see you. It's kinda awesome if you ask me. I've tried a few different drinks but my favorite will always be the iced quad (large) Kicker. This drink is sure to wake you up and make you come back to life in those dawn hours before all your co-workers do. If you're new here, remember to ask for the Dutch card. Get 10 drinks and get the 11th free. I'm almost on my way to another free drink. Double stamps on Tuesdays! Oh, and be sure to be charged for a medium size if you order an iced large size. Sometimes they don't always remember so but on their menu, it says an iced large drink is charged at a medium price. Go Dutch!

I got my lip pierced at this location. I did a walk-in and within 10 minutes the piercer was ready to do my piercing. The guy who did my piercing was nice and he answered my questions with some confidence. The piercing went great- no pain and I was on my way within 15 minutes. Swelling is inevitable so the next two days I go about doing what I can to control the swelling. However, both ends started closing in with constant bleeding and I became worried. My entire inside lip became bruised fast and I began to feel severe pressure. I called the establishment to ask what was going on, if this was normal and what steps I should take. I talked to the guy who did the piecing. He sounded like he wasn't sure himself and he had no confidence in his answers. He suggested I take the piercing out and let it close- that it is likely my body is rejecting it. He was of no help! So I wanted to get a second opinion before taking it out- I called HTC in Tempe on University. They suggested I come in immediately- sure enough the labret stud that was pierced at Modern was way too small for my lip size. Even without swelling I was told it was still a tight fit for my downsize. In addition to the labret stud closing in, my lip was suffering severe trauma, bleeding and bruising. I was also told never to take a piercing out on my own due to the risk of closing in an infection. I was stunned to learn what could have happened to me if I took the piercing out on my own! HTC took care of me- replaced the labret stud that was of sufficient length and instructed the healing process will be longer now due to Modern's mistake. For my unfortunate situation, HTC gave me a discount on the piercing they had to correct. I don't recommend this place and their $20 piercing special. Go to HTC in Tempe- they will take care of you. I got the impression this place doesn't care about your safety and concerns. I learned if the price is too good- it probably is too good to be true.

I'm not a big hookah kinda guy but this location rocks. They are so friendly and social. I had a great experience the last time I went with friends. Check in and you get a discount on your visit. I believe when I went it was $5 off when you spend at least $20. I think it was worth the experience and plan to visit again soon. Not sure if every night is the same but they play great music and sports are on. They also serve food and drinks. Grab some friends and check out this place- you won't be disappointed.

This review is coming from a guy who does not drink beer but will say this is the only place in Tempe I will have a beer or two at! I love the vast selection that is offered at World of Beer and there are quite some strong stuff. I have found that I enjoy stout beer the most and they have quite the selection on stout (both draft and bottled). If I'm going to drink beer, it will be flavorful and heavy. Staff is great and if not all, most are very informative about the selection and are always willing to give samples. I can be indecisive about what I want and the staff is great at helping me make up my mind. I recommend to anyone who enjoys beer and even to those who don't drink beer much. One of my favorite spots on Mill Ave.

Rita's reminds me of my visits to New York and New Jersey. I love frozen custard. This location has been around for some time but I barely discovered them about a month ago! Now I don't have to wait til I visit Jersey or New York again to have Rita's. The staff is very friendly and informative. They will let you try flavors until you are sure of your choice! Also ordered a pretzel at my last visit with my ice and I was very pleased. I believe they are even open late til 10pm or so. I will update this review when I confirm their hours.

I had used this shop to get an all four wheel alignment. After getting the alignment, they told me they could not align the rear wheels as it required shims. They gave me an estimate of $400 to install the shims and I would have to get an alignment again. Frustrated, I paid the $60 and got the front only aligned. After leaving on my way to California, I noticed the steering wheel was off to the left. I called back to explain and the guy at the counter informed me it was "the trade off" for getting the wheels aligned in the front only and missing shims in the back. I was frustrated knowing my wheel was off. I felt this still wasn't right because the steering was on point straight before I took it in. I ended up calling the Nissan dealer and they told me "the trade off" was unheard of and I shouldn't trust that shop. I ended up having Nissan do a second alignment for $99 and they told me no shims were required. I picked up the car today and the steeling wheel is center, it drives straight and no shims required! Oh, and Nissan actually did a 4 wheel alignment no problem! I won't be able to get my $60 back from this place but at least I know not to trust them. I would recommend to my Yelpers to go somewhere else.

Zipp's newest location I believe and the only reason why I have returned my visits to Mill. I have always been a fan of Zipp's and their Zipperita's. Order just a couple and you sure will feel a good buzz! But my favorite is the vodka wells for $2.75 during happy hours, you can't go cheaper than that! They have great happy hour specials and they always have late night specials starting at 8pm with other great deals. Each late night special varies and you can never go wrong with $4 Zipperita's or $4 Fireball shots. Service is fast and friendly. When the big games are on, it does get pack and expect service to be a bit busier than usual. This is always my first stop with happy hour after a long day at work. I haven't been here on the weekends yet but I try to avoid the college binge drinking nights on Mill. I prefer happy hours during daylight (I'm old man) and they are very relaxed here.
