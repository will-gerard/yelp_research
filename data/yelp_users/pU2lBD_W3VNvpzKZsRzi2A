they have the best ice cream ever. it is better than any ice cream or gelato shop i've ever been too.  i'm addicted to the bubblegum, which is labeled something like chiclet or chica. it is bright blue. and it is heaven in my mouth.

five stars is simply not enough.  i was always scared to try this place. i don't even think i knew it was still a functioning restaurant.   i'm glad i was wrong.

i use to always go here.  always always always..   i only stopped because i moved downtown.  super strong drinks. super cheap. super random crowd, only thing in common is, professional drinkers/drunks.

i love home depot. and i am there very often.  everybody at this location and every location i have gone to is always a little too helpful/bothersome... and more so, if i am there solo.  BUT, avoid this location if you're looking for any type of cutting services for lumber. there machine has been broken since october.

home depot has contacted me and i was told the lumber cutting equipment is back in working order..  i cannot confirm this, but i hope it is, as this is the home depot closest to my flat!

best jewelry selection ever. lots of custom pieces, along with gold and platinum.  kelsey or glen have done all my piercings, some that i do not even have anymore - been going here for years and years.. they're the best around.

this place could be SO much better. remember pearl?  the selection for every medium here is tiny. the only selection that seems to be quite large is the drawers filled with letraset sheets. but i think i might be the only person still buying these.  i will go here if i really need something with a quickness OR those rub on letters, otherwise i will just order anything i need from dickblick.com.

yeah, use to be awesome. but maybe not. i don't really remember. i think i just always really loved the super strong martinis.   otherwise, overrated. completely. but, recently i did come to learn that the hot dog here is better than roosevelt. which is saying a lot.

i can never remember if i like the hash browns or home fries. it's the home fries, definitely. portions are super huge. i don't go here nearly enough, but maybe that's a good thing. breakfast is too delicious for words.

i'm going to be nicer this time.  while i still think the service is really really bad, if you're not sitting at the bar.   they do have cachaca (a brazilian rum) and they make an amazing caipirinha.

yum.  but, i do not come here that often because i cannot help myself, as i am seriously addicted to refined sugar.  oh, the cookies here are better than the [cup]cakes. but everything i have tried is just, amazing.

the size of the screens is about 4 of my tvs put together. my dwr couch that doubles as a bed is more comfortable than the sitting in this place.  too bad it's the only 'theater' to see any good movies.

i've gone to switch and fez a lot more.   but after my sunday morning brunch, ticoz is my new brunch spot (not because i don't like switch or fez). but simply because cheandra was soooo awesome. so, definitely sit at the bar.

went back this past sunday.  the red potatoes are a lot better than the hash browns.   because it was a sunday, it was pretty packed and service wasn't as good as i would of hoped. but i liked the food better this time! definitely going to return.

ride it every day. it's still clean.  i like it a lot.  & of course i think it should run later, and i wish there was a lot more bars within walking distance of the stations.  i think i like the camelback station the very most.

i tried the thai river noodles. they will not replace the love i have for a dan dan noodle bowl. but the thai noodles, they were good.  i like this place because it has really opened hours compared to everything else around here. and the food in inconsistent. oh also, the new soda machines are very entertaining. just watch....  this is usually a last resort option (everything else in the area is closed). but it is a good one nonetheless.

i wasn't gonna do this. i wasn't gonna let my lil secret out (eyelash extensions), but.......  because i am so in love with them (my falsies!) the lil lady who does them i will. alexa is awesome.  i first got them done in march i think. i try to go back every 2-3 weeks for a fill.. but i always forget how good the fills will look because even at the 3 week point, my eyes still look amazing.  also, ladies, this service will not be the cost of a car payment in up keep.... (i promise!). AMAZING. go see alexa, immediately!

so good.  cocktails were strong. good wine list and i heard this from a wine snob so that says something.  it also made me a duck (i have had it several times, from the phoenician, biltmore, etc - never liked it, too greasy) convert.  the cheesecake, there is no words and i am a cheesecake snob, without the graham cracker crumb crust, i'd normally say no way. but, omg, literally, best cheesecake i have ever had.

went again last night. more of the same kind of awesome.  tried the papaya mango spring roll.. so hot. literally. so good. the lemongrass clams were also amazing.  hittin this place up on wednesdays, is a good move because of the farmers market. they have bacon wrapped tomatoes as one of their specials. i didn't try this, but it was ordered and 'it's like a BLT'.. all super good.

i use to think this was one of the most boring places to drink ever.  after saturday night, my opinion was changed. but only a little tiny tiny bit. random crowd. good drinks (drinks are strong, and the bartenders pour that long)..  and well, if you're so inclined, drugs could very easily be copped here. #dontdoit #drugs  nevertheless, if you stay here long... you'll feel like hell the next day for sure.

ika sansai, sunshine or rising sun roll.  for hot stuff, firecracker (chicken) or kareh raisu (beef) are both delish.  & always a gin press or two or three...

i love this place.  i hate the 'artwork'.  haven't had a picnic here yet. was too hot by the time it was down to really throw down a proper style picnic. (although i'd probably feel guilty, as they're a lot of bums around...)

well... everything might have changed here - but one thing remains the same - my food was just as cold as it was every time i went to palette.  i'll probably be back - i gave palette six tries before i realized NOTHING was going to make my food hot. but what the f&@%? get some warmers or something. this is silly.

i went back for more yesterday.. happy i did.  dr ben did two fillings yesterday. they were both quite deep. one was worse than the other. he was confident the deeper one would take as a cavity but of course, couldn't say for certain. he hopes, i hope. (it is amazing he recommended cavities for the deeper one, because the cost difference is huge and i'm paying out of pocket).  i trust his experience and judgment. and i am grateful he isn't looking to line his pockets.  so far, so good. no temperature sensitivity. no major throbbing.  i am so happy i found this dentist.

i am thankful something like this can and does exist in phoenix.   the retail and gallery space are both amazing. as previously mentioned, the merch here, you can't find anywhere else locally.  we're lucky to have these guys. thanks to kyle and jeff for having a vision and executing it well.

go go go go go.  i got the chocolate, it was a mix of dark and milk chocolate. i like that. i normally never get chocolate.  it's open until 2 am. are you kidding me? go.  also, home made freaking waffle cones. seriously. h-o-m-e-m-a-d-e.  and, they get softer as your ice cream melts. amazing. go go go go.
