Excellent birthday dinner!  Spot on service and the food was delicious! You can't go wrong with the Scotch Beef - met in your mouth good!

Awesome store and even better people. We bought a vintage industrial crank table with reclaimed cedar top in a basket weave pattern. Nick worked closely with us to make sure the stain was just the right color. Thanks for the awesome service.

Jon is very attentive to your personal needs.  He takes the time to understand what you  need to make yourself feel better.  He tailors each session to you.  A well rounded masseur and a healing experience.

Great store to find unique gifts for any occasion.  Such an eclectic selection and always changing - stop by anytime you want to find a unique gift for the someone "special"!

Horrible Service Experience - went in Friday and personally scheduled a Service appointment for the following Wed morning.  When I arrived, the tech manually took all my information again and then dropped it off on a Rep's desk who proceeded to help a customer that arrived after I did and then left m sitting in the lobby for 10 minutes without asking me anything.  After waiting 15 minutes to drop a car off for an oil change, I was getting a little upset.  Follow that up by having to call the rep in the afternoon to see if the car was ready.I'll be finding a better Service Center.
