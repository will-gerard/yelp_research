My friend and I just had a 10 minute text message conversation about how FREAKING GOOD this place is. A few things to know about me: I live downtown, I know good food, I DO NOT eat at Chili's... ever. When I say something is good, I mean handcrafted, fresh ingredients, bursting with legitimate flavor good.   But enough about me. You want to know about Blue Fin, so here's the lowdown:   - Super clean digs and friendly, wonderful personal service from the most adorable little ladies.   - Tender (non-bouncy) char-grilled teriyaki chicken thoroughly marinated in a not-too-sweet sauce that tastes slightly fermented (in the best way) with a touch of sesame.   - Great steamed veggies that melt in your mouth served with perfectly cooked brown rice.  - Flavorful miso with generous chunks of tofu.  - Wonderful house made sauces. My favorite is the sweet and sour sauce, the kind they serve with spring rolls and dumplings, it's tangy and full of fresh ginger.  - Affordable prices, generous portions, and great for healthier mid-week dinner take-out if you can get there before 6:30.  Go!

Put simply. I LOVE Avanti.   My cousin treated me and my fiance to dinner here in celebration of our engagement over the summer and I have been back several times since...would go more often if I could afford it ;)   This place is seriously a hidden gem, and you would never guess how amazing it is from the outside. Do not be fooled by the ho hum exterior and questionable location, their food is beyond delicious authentic Italian mastery! I brought my very picky Sicilian friend for dinner once and she was impressed. Yes, yes.. the bread basket is lackluster, but the run of the mill rolls in no way reflect on the caliber of the actual food. Try the osso bucco, and definitely ask about the special!  What about the service you ask? Oh my....don't get me started, they treat you like their best customer who has been a patron for years (and they have been open for that long too). Each server we've had has been friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and downright charming.   On a side note, the 80's elegant interior is just a bonus! Black and white floors, mirrors galore, dark, moody and strangely intriguing. If you're lucky you might land on a Friday night with Jersey Joe at the piano belting some Sinatra cover giving the place a definite Copacabana (right out of Goodfellas) mob like feel.   So, do yourself a favor and make a reservation for an evening at Avanti...and be sure to order a godfather on the rocks while you're at it (It's not like you can get away with it anywhere else in town).  P.S. Dinner is around $18-$30 a plate, drinks and appetizers are priced accordingly... totally worth every penny.

Ever since I was a little girl, picking out the Christmas tree has been one of my most favorite holiday traditions. (My dad has it down to an exact science!) So when I found Whitfills last year, I was so excited to come across a place to buy my tree that made my Christmas tree shopping experience even more special and memorable.  While Whitfills is a full service nursery, I have only purchased Christmas trees there. In fact this is the second year in a row we have gotten our Christmas tree from Whitfill. I don't think we will ever go back to picking them out of a stack in in a parking lot or the back of some busy garden center.   First of all, this locally owned family establishment has much more charm than any retail giant, the workers are always so helpful and friendly, AND they even provide hot cocoa! If you're picky about the type of tree you're looking for they have a good variety to choose from too, Nobel Fir, Douglas Fir, Frasier Fir, Grand Fir, Scotch Pine, you name it! All of the trees are in their own stand and watered daily, not wrapped up and thrown on top of each other. The result of all that special care is a beautiful, fresh Christmas tree that is just beyond comparison. True, they do run a little more than you would pay at Home Depot or Lowes, but it's an extra $10 well spent.   P.S. This place is just minutes from the Farm at South Mountain, which is also bomb. So while you're in the neighborhood, you might as well make an event out of picking up your Whitfill tree and head over to the awesome cafe at the farm afterward!

East Coast Italian eatery with no frills, all flavor, damn good food.   Me and my hubby stopped in for dinner tonight, he got the meatball sub, I had the calabrese  lady- we came hungry, left full, and feeling like we had just returned from Brooklyn.   What makes Calabria stand out is the quality ingredients they use, and the neighborly service. You get the feeling that the owner, Carlo, has been a family friend for years.   Homemade meatball sub is outstanding, and super yum. House marinara sauce was slightly sweet (turns out they use carrots) so quality, and seriously savory!   The Calabrese Lady was equally impressive. Fresh baked chicken straight from the oven? Yes please! With fresh mozzarella and oh-so- tasty roasted garlic and red peppers. In love.    Downright delicious Italian grubs. We will be back.  P.S. Foodie tip: you must try the the arancini (Italian stuffed rice ball). This dish is dangerously addictive, not even kidding. It's not on the menu, so just be sure to call ahead and see if they have any available that day.

Gem of a Mom and Pop's little bike shop on the corner. Nice selection of higher end cruisers and accessories by Electra and more professional brands like Trek and Gary Fisher for the serious cyclist.   While their selection of tires and other bike parts can be somewhat limited, it's their willingness to help and outstanding customer service is what keeps me coming back. Besides, Landis will order you any part they don't happen to have in stock. They know bikes like the back of their hand, and will fix yours for a fair price too. They do good work, and they do it with a smile.

Just tried out this spot for the first time tonight. Living in Phoenix, my standards for Chinese food are not very high in general, but alas...the boyfriend was craving and Prime is just a few minutes from our place.Thought we would give it a go. Have to say, this place was much better than I was expecting!  We walked in to find a surprisingly minimalist, modern decor...nice.  The host greeted us almost immediately, and we opted to go with two egg rolls with the chicken teriyaki and general tso's (I had wanted to try the pumpkin chicken listed on the menu, but apparently its only available in November...sad day). Our food was ready in about 15 minutes, we carried out, and on the short drive home the boyfriend noted that if the food tasted as good as it smelled, then we were in for a real treat.   Needless to say, it did not disappoint. The entrees, especially  the sauces tasted notably homemade...not full of corn syrup and artificial flavors. I liked the authentic flavors and generous portions of chicken (however a minimal amount of veggies). The rice had more flavor than per usual, and was cooked perfectly! The egg rolls were a treat, and overall the food was pretty satisfying. My only complaint is that the food could have used a bit more flavor and a larger serving of vegetables.   In short: it's clean, cute, great service and good food. I would go back.  Entrees start around $8 and go up to $13ish.

This is by far, the worst salon I've been to in years for the price. The staff is unfriendly, patronizing, and the stylist are not skilled enough to be charging what they do.   When I arrived, the stylist I was to see had changed, they assured me that the switch would make no difference as the new stylist was also a master (5 years+ experience). Turns out they lied to me point blank, the girl told me herself that as a recent high-school grad, she had been doing hair for just under 2 years. Sadly, a horrible haircut was the result. No blending, no texturizing, and not even close to resembling the photos I had brought in for reference.   I called the next day to complain and see if I could schedule a redo with another stylist, they informed me that if I wanted my style retouched at no extra charge I would have to stick with the same stylist who botched my hair to begin with. Ummm thanks, but no thanks.   Do yourself a favor and SKIP this unprofessional, substandard salon. You'll only end up disappointed if you don't.

Love FEZ! I go here quite often because of a) the close proximity to where I live, b) the bomb service, and c) the oh-so tasty grubs. Fez is just perfect for Happy Hour (Seriously!!), late night dinner and brunch. You really just can't go wrong here. It's fun, casual, and aesthetically pleasing.   Lowlights:   - Parking can be out of control at Happy Hour, whatever you do...don't give in to temptation to park in FedEx/Kinkos spaces! - Fondue on the bar menu. Not a fan. Tastes like more roux than actual cheese. Never again.   Highlights:   - Lord do these people know how to pour a glass of wine! Portions are   generous, to say the least.  - Shrimp Krisra, or any Krisra for that matter.  - Gyro bowl, hummus, and sweet potato fries! - MANHATTAN & the Apricosmo!! - Pesto & Dijon Lamb Chops

FEZ is now on my "forever favorite" list of midtown establishments. With their awesomely late hours of full dinner service, creatively delicious dishes, and ALWAYS outstanding service, how could they not be?   I've been frequently FEZ for the past two years now, but the reason for my surge of ardent affection, you ask? They turned my potentially lackluster Valentine's day into something lovely.  The man I married, bless his heart, is just not very adept at the whole Valentine's day deal. And while I have come to accept this, his last minute attempts to salvage the "holiday" can be disappointing if not disastrous.   Lucky for his forgot-to-make-reservations self, FEZ was a reliable, brilliant, and downright perfect choice for a romantic and memorable meal. Thanks to FEZ, my v-day challenged but quick thinking hubby was safely out of the dog house. Oh, and the hand-made cutie valentines card he presented didn't hurt either.   Lemon caper tilapia, and apricosmo were divine. Best Valentine's day dinner ever. Thanks!

100% bomb! Everything they make oozes amazing, homemade, quality goodness. The pancakes are heaven, the hog and chick is fab, and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect. I have been a handful of times, and it's always worth the wait.  Note: This place is ridiculously small (but charming), so don't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together...or be seated anytime soon. Carry out is a good option, but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ;)

Frances is quite lovely. I stopped in when Christmas shopping to pick up a pair of TOM'S for my sister (yes, they carry those!) and  was mesmerized by the whimsical jewelery display, the clever books, beautiful stationary, creative knick knacks and aromatic candles. The staff is quite friendly and helpful too.  Although smaller in size, this place is perfect when you need unique gifts for those hard to please people in your life, they even have gifts for men, babies and pets. The only downside is that... as boutiques go, they are a bit pricey. Can't wait until I have extra cash on had so I can go and splurge!

Horrible Service. Beyond Horrible food! I went here for lunch with my Dad today since he was vising from out of town. I was going to take him to Got Sushi (which is great P.S.) across the street, but I had never tried Zushi and it looks so pretty from the outside so I decided to give it a whirl. Huge mistake on my part!   We stood in the lobby for at least 10 minutes before even being acknowledged, and it wasn't like they were busy (in fact they were quite slow for lunch hour...which I should have taken as a hint). Anyway, when we finally got our seats, we didn't even get to place our drink orders until 20 minutes later! When the food finally did come another half hour later, (we ordered the Rainbow Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Eel Roll, and Albacore Nigiri) it was sloppy, not fresh, avocado was brown, the whole meal was just generally unpleasant.   I don't recommend....will never go back. I am very sorry that I missed out on a great sushi lunch that I could have had at Got Sushi across the street. That was $24 and 1.5 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back. Sad.

Shame on me for not dining here sooner. NOCA is absolutely perfect in every way possible. I can't even begin to explain how ridiculously delicious the food is here. You just have to experience it for yourself.   My friend and I each each had several courses for dinner. Naturally, we shared each one to sample as many things as possible. The pork belly confit was divine. The mussels steamed in in white wine, garlic, and chorizo were titillating (make sure you have extra bread to sop up that amazing broth). As for the main course and dessert, I won't go into details, but both were simply stunning in flavor and presentation.    Super fresh ingredients. Inventive menu. Impeccable service (except the fact that they lost my reservation... thank goodness they had a table for two available!), and not the very least pretentious. Book a table at NOCA and bring on the foodgasm.

Me and my Pops stopped by for lunch a couple of weeks ago. We actually came across it by accident due to me hitting a curb and blowing out my tire...stopping the first place I could and happening upon D'licious Dishes. Such a pleasant surprise.   The inviting atmosphere of this upscale deli feels more like visiting someone's home kitchen. The turkey cranberry sandwich and chocolate chip cookie I had tasted equally homemade and yummy. As for the service, it was warm and welcoming.    D'licious Dishes also has a great selection of cold grab and go entrees and sides for a fabulous "homemade" dinner when you're in a rush. I picked up some of their stuffed portabello mushrooms to serve as appetizers that night. Unfortunately, they were so good that I didn't get to try any. That's right, they were gobbeled up just minutes after they came out of the oven. Evidence that they too, must have been quite tasty.   I will definitely be returning when I want a quality sandwich, when I'm too lazy to make a decent dinner, or when I want to bring something impressive to a party and just haven't had the time to cook it up myself (of course I'll take alllll the credit, sorry D'Licious Dishes!).  Oh and p.s. they have fantastic selection of vino and microbrews! Um, necessary!

I've been twice so far, both times...great nail job. I got acrylics with gel overlay, they do a meticulous job. This spot is clean,  well priced (my full set with gel overlay was only $30), and the service is great too. After having some very disappointing experiences at two different shops near my work, I am so glad to have found a reliable nail salon that I can count on for consistently perfect looking nails. Yay!

LOVE Postino, best bruschetta  ....ever. Go on Monday or Tuesday after 8 and you can get a giant sampler of it AND a bottle of wine for $20. Love their brunches, love their location, love the free valet parking. It's basically a giant love fest. Also, their staff is amazing, no matter how busy they are you always get great friendly, timely service from lovely people. P.S. they like dogs too, so sit on the patio and you can bring yours...they even have little doggie dishes of water to keep your furry friend hydrated. What's not to like.

What an adorable and oh-so fun local spot to go and get your happy fix! I went in just before Christmas and dropped about $45 bucks on some unique novelty items and hard to find vintage candies, plus I had a fantastic time doing so.   Smeeks is good for three things:   - Fun and inexpensive novelty gifts - Old School sweets like pop rocks, candy cigarettes, and moon pies - Just having fun and maybe even squeezing in a photo booth sesh  I will return anytime I have the need to feel like a kid again, want to pick up some fun party items, or have something to celebrate.

Three words: Honey Vanilla Latte. Gah! I love it!   Giant Coffee is a simple and delicious way to start your day. The interior and atmosphere they have created are just gorgeous. The deconstructed vintage charm makes it familiar while the sleek modern layout gives it a calming presence that is downright soothing.   Matt and Erenia Pool definitely know what they are doing. Just like their other local establishments (Roosevelt Tavern and Matt's Big Breakfast), you can expect to find quality, super fresh ingredients in everything Giant Coffee serves up. It's a difference you can taste. I only wish the tortilla on my yum burrito hadn't been so dry, and that they had at least one gluten free option on the menu so my poor wheat-allergic little sister could have had breakfast too. That is all.   Overall this place is a real charmer, and deserves your business far more than any Starbucks could ever hope to. Plus it's within walking distance from the downtown library. What more could you ask for?   P.S. Giant Coffee is no longer cash-only and will happily accept your credit/debit card. How convenient. Yayers!

The new Pita Jungle Downtown location in the Gold Spot building is pretty sweet. Healthy eats at reasonable prices, wrapped in a hip looking ambiance is money.   As a downtown dweller, I LOVE that they are open on Sunday. Plus they have a fantastic patio in the back with a bar (BAR) so I can bike on over and get my day-drinking on.   Chicken shawarma is my standard fave, hummus is always good. Pitas can be a little dry I've noticed, they need to get on that. Oh, and they serve wood fired pizzas here, haven't tried one yet but from the descriptions on the menu they look pretty yum. Will order one next time and report back for sure!

Walking into Arrogant Butcher will instantly increase your swank level by at least 25.6%, seriously.   This modern chophouse by Sam Fox puts a sexy spin on nouveau-nostalgic, and trendy flair on classic American fare in typical Fox fashion. Plus it's located in the heart of downtown Phoenix which is on the verge of a full blown revival, and right on the lightrail which makes it terribly convenient for anyone who lives in the area.   The handcrafted cocktails were quite impressive. I'm all over house made mixers,  vintage spirits, and super fresh ingredients that translate into something really sublime in every sip. Don't miss the bourbon infused 'Candlestick Maker', and if you're in the mood for something sensational and eclectic look no further than the heavenly gin and chartreuse laced cocktail dubbed 'The Last Word'. Indeed.  For the soft-opening we attended the service was spot on, actually more like exceptional. And the food they served up followed closely behind. We sampled the mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder with pomme frites (that's fancy for french fries), crab stuffed chicken, skirt steak and grilled swordfish with artichokes hearts.  Although slightly salty, and somewhat expected... it was still  flavorful,  delicious, and very satisfying.   Yes, Fox is a somewhat of local restaurant giant and Arrogant Butcher does have a decidedly chain vibe to it. But why so serious, downtown/midtown/cenpho elitist diner? It's a chain vibe in the best sense of the term. It really was an overall a fantastic and festive experience! Definitely joining the ranks of lively new downtown establishments I plan to frequent often.   Look for me at the bar, cocktail in hand, swag in full effect. Thank you very much.

BIG news for East Valley Thai Lovers! The daughter the famed Thai Basil (Phoenix location) proprietor is all grown up and has opened up her own shop. Let me tell you, the apple does not fall far from the tree - she is on a solid path to out-do her Dad's culinary greatness in no time. Besides that, Thai Patio is an overdue and  sure to be welcomed surprise to Thai deprived north east Mesa dwellers.   I went in for lunch with a group of co-workers today and each of us fell instantly in love. The amazing smells that greet you when you walk through the door are enough to make you want to come back, but the food itself is just epic. One member of our group (I won't name names) actually could not resist finger licking the remaining green curry remnants off his plate. Thai Patio is just that good. Can't wait for the work week to come around again so I can go back and try another of their super yum (and super affordable - $6.95) lunch specials! Yay!

As a downtowner, there are far too many amazing pizza joints to choose from for me to even consider wasting my money at Humble Pie ever again. The food is OK, but your time is much better spent at Cibo, Bianco, Z Pizza, or even Pinot's!   AMBIANCE:   First off, the ambiance is seriously lacking. Small, boring space with bad lighting and poor music selection. Also, nasty smelling bathrooms. Thanks, but no thanks.   DRINKS:   Secondly, they serve up a HORRIBLE $9 lukewarm cocktail that tastes like pickle juice and vodka, masquerading as a cucumber gin libation. BEYOND disgusting. Shocked at first sip, I was too turned off to try any of their other specialty cocktails. Thankfully, they let me swap this disaster of a drink out for a nice glass of chardonnay.   FOOD:   As for appetizers, they were out of the teppanyaki green beans we wanted to try. The Calabrese salad was decent, but nothing to write home about, certainly not capable of rivaling the likes of what they serve up at Postino's. The steak turkey chili was underwhelming... in fact, the only decent option worth mentioning are the garlic fries.  Pizzas were acceptable, but they won't split your order. My husband and I wanted to order half a Schriner's Sausage and half Pear Gorgonzola, no such luck. This place is one of the ONLY pizza joints I've visited in town that won't accommodate a half and half order. Super disappointing.  OVERALL:   The icing on this giant lackluster cake was their refusal to honor the coupons we brought in. We came in for dinner with some neighbors of ours, all of us lured by the prospect of spending $20 and receiving a free pizza. Unfortunately, after telling the waiter about our coupons from the beginning, and ordering WELL over $20 per couple, we were told at the very end that only one of our coupons would be honored.   Needless to say, we were all extremely let down by this entire experience, and will definitely NOT be back. Ridiculous waste of $50 (coupon and all)!

The Yard looks amazing, the concept is cool... and that's about it.   Sadly, after three visits, I've decided to take this spot out of the rotation. BUT WHY, you ask? How could I, with all the cornhole and ping pong and beer and whatnot?! Welp, I'll tell you:  The service is complete crap.   Every. Time. We wait forever, get attitude from the staff, and have even experienced dirty glasses and cold food. Once, I ordered a "red Stella" (this is a simple concoction of Stella Artois and bloody mary mix.) I order it all over town and get it served up perfectly. Not only did they not know what it was here, they refused to mix it, insisting I get a shot of bloody mary mix on the side. It wouldn't mix up properly like that and my beer was warm. I complained and the server rolled her eyes at me.   My friend got a dirty greasy glass with her Jameson and soda.   Our overpriced fries and burgers were ice cold, IN THE SUMMER IN PHOENIX. This is no easy task, my friends.   Finally, we waited over an hour to play cornhole. When a spot finally opened up, the dude playing before me just handed me his bean bags. I had no idea I had to actually rent them. I got yelled at by a bouncer who snatched up all the game equipment and insisted I go provide my drivers license to reserve them. I had no problem doing so, but by the time I had finished waiting to speak to someone at the register, they said the spot had already been reserved by someone else and I'd have to wait for another one to open up.   Thanks, but no thanks. Three strikes and you're out.
