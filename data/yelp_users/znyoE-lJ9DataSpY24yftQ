To start off I absolutely loved this hotel! I stayed two nights here because I found a awesome deal on trivago. I asked for a third floor room & a king bed. Walking in, the room was a great size! Separate living area from bedroom! the TVs were so nice! And the coffee bar and computer area were stocked and great! The sofa folded out into a bed and it was comfortable also. The bedroom was amazing! The bed was so comfortable and everything was so clean! The bathroom is so stylish and modern! I loved everything about this room! I will definitely be staying here again.  The free breakfast in the morning is great! Sausage biscuits and gravy & also egg muffins, cereal, pancakes, waffles,  etc.  Everything was fresh and so good!  They have a bar open till 12am in the lobby which was nice. Free WiFi which had great speed. The parking was great also. I parked right under my room so I could see my car.  You can tell it used to be a old hotel of some kind but they did a amazing job of refurbishing it. I love everything about this place! The staff was very friendly and helpful!  I didn't get a chance to hit the pool but it looked nice.   I would give more then 5 stars if I could!  Thanks Hyatt!

This place is a hidden treasure. My son loves trains so we stopped here.. To my surprise it was amazing. I myself had a great time also. My son loved it all. The train ride was awesome and its only $2 children are free it they ride with a adult. The carousel was $2 also the same free with a adult. They have a great place ground and life size trains also!  Ice cream shop with drinks and a play table inside in the AC to cool off. Bought a ice cream and a ice tea and a train sucker and it was only $5. The prices here are great! My favorite part had to be the mini train museum. It was amazing! So many different parts and completely interactive for kids. It was a great time. I will definitely be coming back here again!

I found a deal on Groupon and decided it would be nice to go cool off and have some fun. Man was i wrong. I would have rather stayed home and sat in the bathtub.  The place is very rundown, it needs some major paint and upgrades. Its also not a very clean park. I am beyond disappointed. Upon arrival they do a bag search and I had a small bag or chips in a zip lock bag that was very old and the guy made it seem like i was a criminal for trying to bring them in. I threw them away of course. I guess you can bring your own unopened waters into the park but nothing else. They want you to pay $18 for a hamburger! Crazy talk! We just didn't even bother eating there. So eat before you go if you even go.  The kiddie area was very run down and didn't offer much. The older kid area with the color slides was a little better but it was full of adults sitting in the shaded water part so there was no room for people with actual kids.  The lockers are $7 or $10 for a large. This was the first wave pool ive ever seen in my life where you had to wait in line to go in.. Normally you can just go right in.. Eventually they opened it up to everyone but to sit there for ONE wave every 5 MINUTES was boring. They need to have at least 3 or 4 waves and then a break. They use a load of chlorine in water so be prepared for your eyes to burn.  There was no really exciting rides at all. Most slides were simple and boring. Along with 50+ flat tubes laying everywhere.  The lifeguards need to chill out, you cant touch a wall here without them yelling and blowing their stupid whistle at you. Its annoying. They need to lighten up.  All the stuff that would make this place 10x better was closed off. I wont be coming back to BigSurf in my lifetime. I wish Groupon gave refunds for it because it was not even worth the $17 a person. I would not even pay $1 to go here. The bathrooms are a mess and they dont have changing stalls.   One plus is that they do offer free lifejackets for kids. Thats about the only thing i liked about this place.  Where is the lazy river? Beats me.   Beyond disappointed i wasted 3 hours here. Couldn't stand it any longer.

Stopped by here to wear my son out before we went home. I did not expect the shear size of this park. Its huge. There is a cute little pond that would be great for pictures. There was multiple playgrounds for different age groups. My two year old enjoyed all of them despite the age group. I saw they had a train that goes around but sadly it was closed . my son would have loved that.  The park seems very well kept. The grass was amazing.  The only thing i wish they would add would be a few water fountains for drinks around the park, like maybe at each playground. My two year old ran pretty much around the entire park, he was wore out when we left and he had a blast chasing the birds. Overall it was a great park and i would go back in the future, hopefully all the attractions will be open.

By far the worst mall I've ever been to in my entire life and I've been to some pretty bad ones. There is absolutely NOTHING here. Don't waste your time. The only good part about this place is the Dillards outlet because everything is super cheap. That is the only reason i would ever go back to that mall, we ventured from one side to the other and it was highly disappointing. Food court? Not much of anything if you ask me. Everything is closed down. Except for some Mexican candy place and a sub shop. That's about it. Just go somewhere else.  Trust me. Haha

Loved this place! The happy hour specials are great! We got there around 930pm but happy hour didnt start till 10 so we ordered water and some Edamame and told our waitress we wanted to wait till 10 to order the rest of our food. She was very nice and polite. We ordered the Vegas Rolls of course and the peppers which were amazing!! The peppers had a little spice to them but not overwhelming. The Vegas Roll was perfect!  For drinks we ordered the blushing geisha and a baby umami.  The blushing geisha was a good concept but it was way to sour and gave my instant heartburn.  Once our food arrived we wanted to move outside because it did get a little chilly inside. Surprisingly. Haha. Once we moved outside it was great. I wish they would add some misters. Theu have heaters for winter..but no misters haha definitely a must have. Would make it so much more enjoyable to be outside. They have two different patios one in the front and one on the back side. We ordered the coconut creme brulee for dessert it was amazing. Overall i would come back here but probably only for happy hour because it can get pricey if not on happy hour.  Thanks RA  Their wasabi is great!!  ** another not enjoyable part was once we were outside there was a group of about 5 people drinking heavily and cussing up a storm, it was not very enjoyable to hear the whole time outside**

I had to get my driver side window replaced. My Insurance recommended them. Steve did a great job! Maybe took 45 minutes if that! He cleaned all my Windows but didn't vacuum like everyone says they do. There were a few pieces of glass left on the floor of the garage so that part im not happy about hence the 4 stars not 5. Overall the replacement window is perfect & i will recommend them to everyone. Thank you!

I enjoyed this place alot. The portions are massive!! I ordered biscuts and gravy and it was amazing! My mother in law ordered a pancake this thing was massive bigger then ive ever seen before.  My husband ordered the chicken fried chicken. The food overall was amazing and i would come back.  But... Its also very crowded and i felt squished.. The seating is to close together and i hate being sat in the middle of a crowded restaurant especially with a 2 year old.  Overall i would come back but i would sit outside so ill wait for the weather to cool off.

I very much enjoyed this place! The selection on tequila is mind blowing!  The food was great also. I had the fish tacos which only come with one so i had to order more plus additional rice and beans.  I asked for a spicy bloody mary with toppings like olives or celery.. Because thats normally what goes on them. I pretty much got tomato juice with about a pound of pepper in it. Not one olive or any garnish. I didnt even drink it.  The chips and salsa were good though. I would come back to try it again i suppose.

I really really wanted to like this place! I went in to get some diapers and wipes.. Guess what.. They have one brand of diapers which is the honest company.. And then of course cloth diapers everywhere. I didn't want either of those. How are you going to claim to be a baby store when you carry one brand. Haha. The prices seem a little high bit mostly everything has a "floor model". I like that they have a play area for the kids, my son didn't play in it but i saw some kids were. The staff seems decently helpful. I didn't end up buying anything here because i went to target to get diapers instead since they have different brands.  I would come back here if I ran into alot of money and wanted to buy everything top dollar for my next child or maybe even a simple baby gift. Only time will tell if i will ever return here. Definitely not for diapers though haha.

I am beyond disappointed in this place. All the reviews made it seem like such a awesome place. For starters its super small. There is only two areas. There is a area for bigger kids with stuff to build maybe if you child was 4+. The ArtVille place is a cute idea but poorly executed, there is different little "cubby" areas with different things to play with. Socks are required for everyone. There just was not enough here to keep my son entertain long enough. They say artville is for 0-4 only but there was older kids in there which is annoying. It costs $8 a person to come in. Military is free through September 2016. So we got in for free but personally i would never come back here nor pay for it. Its not even worth $2 in my opinion.  I would rather drive all the way to downtown phx to the childrens museum.  Everyone made this place to be something that it wasn't. Sadly i wont return and wont recommend it to anyone.

Drove by this little Gem earlier today, freaked out for a second but I myself am a huge soda freak.. I know i know its not good for me but whatever haha.  I told my husband about it and be suggested we go by after he got off work. Its a old car wash that was refurbished into this awesome place. You pull up and there is two different lanes with the menu in front of you, when you decide what you want then you pull forward around the corner and order. I can see the way they have it set up can cause the wait to be a little longer. If they had a pay here with and pick up window it would go a lot smoother. I ordered the I love Lucy (extra dirty), I'm a old fashion plain coke person so I got one with coke of course and it was freaking amazing still is actually.. Im still drinking it right now. My husband ordered the #Selfie (extra dirty). He enjoyed his alot. He isnt as big of a soda fan as me though.  As far as I'm concerned the dirty is like a cream added in. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. We also ordered a sugar cookie.. OMG! Best sugar cookie ive ever had in my entire life hands down! The frosting was spot on! They also have punch cards for free drinks after so many and on Tuesdays its double punch day.  Overall i enjoyed this place and will definitely come back again.  They have a cute little sitting area with lights and a walk up window for people that are not driving thru.
