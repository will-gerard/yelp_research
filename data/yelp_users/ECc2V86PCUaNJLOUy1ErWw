First visit and was shocked at the prices for Cuban food in a strip mall. Had the Pollo Cubano and it was too sweet.  Couldn't believe that the entr√©es don't come with plantains given the high price ( $17! ) for chicken, rice & beans. Service was friendly but lacked proper attention and followup. Couldn't get a water refill until after I was finished with my meal. Again, for the price, service should be much better. Asked the busser for the check and the manager brought it over and asked how everything was and I shrugged and said "eh, ok "  and he just walked away! Apparently had he didn't want to know more.

My strong recommendation is WARNING DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS PLACE!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I went in for oil change and free car wash. They make you sign a release form before doing the oil change. That should have made me leave right then and there-- that they will take no responsibility for any damage they could do to your car.  But stupidly I went ahead for convenience sake. It took over and hour and half  to do the oil change. When we asked what the deal was they tried to hide the fact that did damage the plug and were replacing it.  At least they fixed it but a good business would not have tried to be discreet and immediately told us what was going on and that it would to take a little longer. A verbal confrontation between my boyfriend and the manager ensued and the manager called the police.  The police said my guy was disturbing the peace--he was very PO'd but  officer agreed that would have upset him too. After all that we were given a discount but the car wash was extremely lousy. The confrontation could have been avoided if the manager would have been apologetic and not defensive form the beginning. I moved from Pasadena CA and I miss the car wash I used to go to-- a very upstanding and always busy place.
