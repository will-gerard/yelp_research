I was in the mood for chicken teriyaki so the BFF & I decided to give Blue Fin a try today before the Suns game. From the looks of it, one would expect a dingy little hole in the wall, but it's actually very clean inside. I secretly did a happy dance when I saw shakers of Japanese chili powder and black sesame seeds on each table.. two of my favorite condiments!   As we approached the counter, we were greeted by a cheerful and helpful lady, whom I later deduced is the owner's daughter. My friend asked which dishes were the most popular and she said, "chicken teriyaki, panko chicken, pork katsu and chicken curry." I ordered the (dark meat) chicken teriyaki combo (comes w/ rice & salad) since that was my craving at the time and the BFF ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef teriyaki combo (it's not on the menu, but the lady was nice enough to accomodate the request).   Our heaping plates arrived a few minutes later and we hungrily dug in. After the first bite, I realized I was kind of disappointed by the chicken teriyaki because the meat was very dry and it was heavily marinated in sauce. I think they gave me white meat, but we were short on time and the lady was busy serving others so I didn't bother asking. The BFF enjoyed his beef & chicken combo which doesn't surprise me since he's very easy to please when it comes to food.    I ate a few more bites so I wouldn't starve during the game and packed up the rest for the BFF to take home. Oh yeah, the salad was OK. Nothing special about it, but I should have figured it wouldn't be since it was only an additional $.80 from a regular teriyaki bowl.   The lady working was not only very nice & helpful when we ordered, but she also went above and beyond what one would expect from a fast food type place. She asked us once or twice if we're doing OK, asked if we needed more rice and as we were about to toss our plates, she offered to do it for us. I also noticed she was just as friendly to the other patrons.. even offered a guy a sample of the chicken teriyaki because he didn't know what to order.   I'd really rate the food at 3 stars, but added an extra for the super nice lady. I'd give something else a try the next time I'm in the area just because she was *that* nice.

I'm glad I had a Deal Chicken deal because the food was just ehhh.   With my credit of $24 and a few extra dollars, I ordered a full rack of pork ribs which included two sides (I chose collared greens & sweet potato fries-- small upcharge that I was not informed of), 1/2lb of hot links and a few free dinner buns.   The ribs were fairly good (3 stars) albeit a bit dry-- I guess that's why they drown it in BBQ sauce. The hot links however were dissssgusting. (0 stars). Just thinking about it makes me want to puke. It was so soft, I quickly tossed out the serving that was on my plate and what was left in the container. They are what I imagine vienna sausages would taste like (but spicy, of course).   Collared greens & sweet potato fries were edible.. not cringeworthy (like the hot links), but not worth the calories/stomach space either.   Service was friendly & efficient.   Warning: be prepared to swat flies if you dine in. There were several on the day I was in... ick!

My friends & I affectionately refer to this place as Mexican Disneyland (I think I stole that from an article on this place or something). Where else can you find bacon dogs, carne asada sold by the pound, bulk cheeses & yogurt, fresh tortillas, 8 or so flavors of agua fresca and chicharrone the size of a "small person" under one roof -- besides maybe, Mexico?   My favorite is the shrimp taco sold in the back of the market at the pescaderia (even though it takes them forever to make) and a large cup of watermelon, cantaloupe, strawberry or horchata agua fresca. It's the perfect meal before a Suns or Diamondbacks game and a hell of a lot cheaper too!   The produce also seems to be alot cheaper than what I normally see at Fry's & Safeway. Too bad I'm never headed straight home or else I'd buy groceries there.    Andale! Andale! to Phoenix Ranch Market!!

LOVE the expanded space! Charming d√©cor, friendly staff and quaint ambiance. Picnic tables are still available outside for patio weather, but now that it's "chilly" (by AZ standards), cozy up inside and delight in the charming atmosphere.

I miss the days where I expensed the airport's short-term parking lot to the company. At $24/day, it's not something I could personally afford! Phx Sky Harbor Airport Parking is a great substitute.   The shuttle drivers are usually always friendly, quick and helpful. I have yet to come across any problems. I always call once I'm ready to be picked up so I never wait too long. A lot of flight attendants and pilots park here too so they're usually on the shuttle sharing a juicy story or two. ;-)   For those of you in the military, ask about the (non-published) military discount. $4.50/day. Can't beat it!!!!

Celebrated my birthday here with 16 of my closest friends & family. Not only were we late for our reservations, but we were pressed for time because my aunts had a flight to catch right after. The staff was superb in meeting our needs, the food was delicious, the ambiance was beautiful (especially overlooking the pool area of the resort) and my young niece & nephews were well taken care of. The prix fixe menu is a good deal, the bowl of corn chowder easily serves 2-3, and the chocolate souffle was to-die for, like always! They were even so kind as to write "Happy Birthday, Jennifer" in chocolate on the rim of my (complimentary) bday cake plate.

Sakana is one of my two favorite neighborhood sushi joints. I love their calamari salad (although the one at this location is considerably smaller than the one on 59th ave) and agedashi tofu. The waitstaff is friendly and their bday song is always fun!   Insider's tip: ask for some real wasabi!

This is THE place to be for the older folks. The cute little seniors all seemed to know one another and it was nice taking a break from the usual Scottsdale crowd and watching them interact w/ one another.   The food however was not as enjoyable.. for me, at least. I had the philly cheese with well done fries for lunch. It was so bland and flavorless I had to dip it in ranch and Tabasco (and I don't even like Tabasco). Good thing the prices are pretty reasonable. I might be back to try out some basic breakfast items since it's usually pretty simple and hard to screw up.   Just remember that it's a cash only joint!

If AMC, the $1 cinema and Denny's were able to birth a baby from a menage a trois, it'd be this.   Farrelli's shows not so new yet not too old movies while serving mediocre food. It was very distracting to watch a movie while servers walked throughout the area serving Denny's quality food. I took a few bites of my food and left it. I've managed to repress the memory of what I ate so I'm sorry I can't warn you all about it.   The concept of dinner & a movie, at the same time, is awesome, but unfortunately, they failed to deliver.

Sushi Ko is my other favorite neighborhood sushi spot. The happy hour from 5-6pm on Sun-Thurs is the best deal in town. I usually stuff my face with 1/2 priced unagi, ama ebi, escolar and spicy scallop nigiri.   Service is pretty good and there are usually seats up at the bar when I'm pressed for time. I'm hoping to try their shabu shabu one day.

Pinnacle Peak Patio is a fun western steakhouse with a beautiful view outside. Snipped ties and old business cards adorn the restaurant dating back to who knows when.. the service was friendly, rotisserie chicken and NY steak were juicy and flavorful.  I'd love to visit again to enjoy the patio or a cookout.    It's a huge restaurant that can even accomodate large parties of 1800 people inside and 2000 outside!!!

Sakana is one of the few sushi places that I return to. There is usually always a wait (no reservations, which is a PITA), but the sushi is fresh, service is quick (so it's not always super friendly), and the calamari salad is SO effin good. Their lunch specials remind me of something I'd find in So. CA-- tasty, filling and reasonably priced. It's lively on the weekends with several tables doing sake bombs so it's a fun place to celebrate birthdays.

delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. my flight out of PVD was delayed, sat on the runway for a good 20mins when we arrived in ATL, they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another 20mins for my luggage. these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to PHX. none of the delta representatives and managers cared. there were no more flights out to PHX that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations and/or a meal voucher so i was stuck in the ATL airport overnight. seriously, one of the worst experiences EVER and i fly a lot.   0* if i could!!!!

I eat here about 2-3x per week. Food is good, service is typical of a divey Asian establishment, it's cheap and very close to where I live.   Try the banh cuong (#72b). It's my new favorite thing to order! The bbq pork spring rolls are also DELICIOUS!

Sketchy name indeed, but their grilled chicken pita sandwich is the bomb! It was filled to the brim with saucy, tasty goodness. I still think about that damn sandwich. I need to go back soon!  Interior was a bit lacking, service was OK, but the food is sooo worth it. Looking forward to trying other things on the menu.

I knew my friends & I would be starving after an evening of stress relief at Shooter's World so I Yelped some restaurants nearby. My friends shot down (pun intended.. har har har) Phx Ranch Market and pho joints off of Camelback so I led them to A&J's for some pizza. We missed the first turn because I was on the look out a sign that said "Angie & Jimmie's Pizza", but only saw "PIZZA" on the window of a shack. We made a u-ey to get a closer look and thinking the parking lots connected with the porno shop, we pulled in too soon. Lo & behold, the parking lots did not connect so we slinkied into the restaurant, hoping no one passing by would recognize our cars parked at the XXX lot.   Anyhow, we took a seat in the dining area and cracked jokes about the lame interior-- empty (clean) pizza boxes stacked against the wall, old arcades in the corner and crappy plastic patio furniture.. Even though I don't drink soda, the free soda fountain was a nice option. It even dispenses horchata!   We ordered a deluxe large pizza, 26 BBQ wings and an order of fries. The pizza was pretty good, but the folded over crust was kind of weird, wings were meaty (albeit a bit too saucy) and the fries were OK-- nicely seasoned w/ spices, but too greasy and not crispy.   I'd give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up because the service was friendly. $36 pre-tax for 3 people w/ leftovers.

Lines are ridiculously long, cashier girls aren't very nice and each time I've been sized (over the span of 2 months), I was given a wide range of sizes.   On the hunt for a reliable and customer-oriented undergarment store...

The club itself is ok and deserves 3 stars. It's more of a crowded lounge/bar since there isn't a dance floor, but it's a chill place w/ good music.  It's the male bartender that really brought the rating down. I would give negative stars if I could. He charged me $31 for 2 Hennessey shots whereas the female bartenders charged $37 for 3 Hennessey shots. For my other friends, he charged $16 for a mixed drink, whereas the females charged $7-9 for the same thing. When the female bartenders were asked why the male was charging so much more, they just said, "he shouldn't be. The prices should be the same no matter who you go to." Apparently not!   To top it all off, I checked my credit card statement today and he decided to add in a nice tip for himself. Luckily, I was able to easily dispute it w/ my CC company, but they are reimbursing me as a courtesy.. not recouperating the difference from Suede bc they said it'd be cheaper for them since it's a relatively small amount.   I'll never go back to Suede again and will continue to warn others to do the same..

Left a few messages for management to "discuss my visit." Have yet to hear back from them. Still holding onto the receipt w/ the bartender's name and transaction # in case someone ever calls. I wonder if they're just too busy fielding calls about said bartender or they really just don't give a crap.    Maybe I should just make a public service announcement and put the shady a** bartender's name on here!?!

I worked with Elliott to plan a going away party for my best friend at RF. He was very accomodating and easy to work with. The prix fixe menu is a great value, the food was delicious (especially the carnitas!!!) and the service was great. We were seated "outside" on the enclosed patio and even though it was very chilly out, the heaters, fireplace and a few cocktails kept us nice & toasty.    The one downer is their POS system does not easily split bills. It all has to be split evenly amongst all the cards and there was some confusion betw paying with cash & cards, but eventually, it all got worked out.

I feel like I should WUI (write under the influence) since that's when I usually eat at Joe's, but I'll spare you all the hassle of having to decipher my drunken stupor.   Joe's is my go-to-place while out in Old Town. My routine is to leave the club around 1am, but not w/o getting a stamp for re-entry, stop in for a slice before a line forms, then return to the club for last call.  They have serveral types of pizza available for re-heating. I like the basil and tomato with no sauce. It has just the right amount of cheese and the crust is slightly crispy yet chewy.   I should try it sober one day. Hopefully I'll enjoy it just as much!

One of my favorite pizza places in the Valley. I've had several different combinations with ricotta and sausage being a few of my favorite toppings. Grimaldi's is always a hit amongst me & my co-workers for lunch. It can get pricey though when going in a large group. We often pay $15 each (incl tax & tip) for 2 slices each. It's so yummy though! Their tiramisu is also really good. I could do w/o their salads.. I have yet to try one that stands out.   And service is usually very good!

Fashion Square is one of the few good malls in the greater Phoenix area. It has a full range of stores to accomodate any wallet-- from Wet Seal to Gucci, Dillards to Neiman Marcus they have it all here. Parking can be a pain and the food court sucks, but really.. who comes to a mall to eat when there are purses to adore at Louis Vuitton? Don't forget about Urban Outfitters across the street!   Oh yeah, and Barney's NY is coming later this year! *squeal!*

Strolled up to Delux today shortly before 7pm and was pleasantly surprised to see some empty tables on a Friday night. My friend & I decided to forgo the 5 minute wait to sit inside (because I was THAT hungry) and were seated right away on the patio. Yes, it was hot as hell and the misters didn't do much,  but I just needed to be fed ASAP!   I had my usual (Delux burger), my friend had the turkey burger and we shared an order of sweet potato fries. I'm really glad he got the turkey burger because I've always wanted to try it, but was always hesitant to order it in case it sucked. It actually turned out to be really good! I'll probably order it the next time I'm there. And the sweet potato fries are so nice & crispy!!! I almost didn't order them because the past several times (last year) the fries were limp (even when I requested them to be well-done/crispy). I guess they finally got a clue and now I heart their fries.. yummy!   Our waitress, Jessica, was great. She was really helpful, friendly and always made sure our drinks were topped off.

Stopped in for dim sum this Sunday afternoon. Picked up the following dishes:   Chinese Broccoli-- best dish here Shrimp dumplings (not har gow)-- bland, wrapper was not done right   Rice noodles w/ shrimp-- wrapper was too thick, flavorless, sauce was also blah Tofu w/ shrimp-- tofu was good, but shrimp stuffing left alot to be desired  Sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves?-- overcooked, only had a big piece of dry pork    All of the dishes lacked flavor. Tried to make it more palatable with hot chili oil, but that was bland too. WTH?!   Left very disappointed. $27 (pre-tip) is way overpriced for dim sum.. especially if it's low quality.   Service was pretty good, but I would not return even though it's right by my house. Very disappointed!!!

My mom and aunts stayed at the Canyon Villas (timeshare section of the JW Marriott @ Desert Ridge) for a week during their visit to the valley. They had a 1BR suite and a studio. The studio was super small and cramped. The 1BR suite was really nice and spacious though. Housekeeping was friendly and attentive. They did a good job of cleaning out the units daily, replenishing whatever was needed and the bell staff was helpful whenever we needed to borrow some muscles.  We walked across the street to the hotel a few times to eat, swim and get massages. The water station at the entrance is a nice touch.. especially during the hot summer months.

I LOVE the brussel sprout salad, fresh made tortillas and the prime rib hash here (wait, that's also everything I've ever had here!). The prices are kind of steep, but the brussel sprout salad is a HUGE serving.     Don't forget to pick up a mini cookie on your way out!   +1 extra star because Chelsea's Kitchen is one of the food sponsors at my volunteer organization's annual major fundraiser. (I experienced the aforementioned food a paying guest in the restaurant.)

After shopping at a couple of different Targets lately (San Bruno, CA, Indian Bend and W Agua Fria Pkwy), I've come to really appreciate this one on FLW. The lines are usually long, but it's something I'm willing to deal with if that means a cleaner and more organized store.

Tonight was my second time dining at Yasu's. I was really excited to score a seat at the sushi bar, eagerly hoping to chat it up w/ the sushi chefs. However, they seemed too flustered w/ all the orders that they made a minimal attempt to talk to me besides asking, "is everything ok?" And I think the Mexican sushi chef is new so the Japanese sushi chef had to instruct him on certain things a few times.   I started off w/ an order of kampachi sushi, per one of the recommendations of the Japanese sushi chef. While it tasted fresh, it was very blah to me... nothing special about it at all.   A few minutes later, the waitress arrived to take my drink order. I decided to just stick w/ water and told her I was ready to order a few items off the paper menu. I had decided on mirugai (giant clam/geoduck) w/ mixed mushrooms, hamachi sashimi w/ jalapenos and ribeye sumibiyaki. First up was the hamachi sashimi w/ jalapeno slices. Nice thick slices of buttery hamachi, but all the seeds were scraped out of the jalapeno slices so they weren't packing much heat. After I ate them all, I remembered that there's a freakin recall on jalapenos in AZ and there wasn't a sign in the restaurant stating that their jalapenos are safe. JUST. EFFIN. GREAT. I hope I don't get salmonella. If you don't hear from me in a few days, pls call for help.. I live alone! And tell them, IT WAS THE JALAPENOS FROM YASU'S THAT DID ME IN!  Anyhow, next up was the mirugai w/ mixed mushrooms dish. Very small portion, but it was tasty. They were a bit skimpy on the mirugai to mushroom ratio so that was a little disappointing. About 10 minutes later, the waitress asks if I'm all done.. I ask her about the ribeye and she asked the sushi chef & kitchen in a frantic tone.. They reassured us it was almost ready. Another 10 mins later, it arrives.. I guess it was worth the wait.. it was soo tender I was able to "cut" off the fat w/ my chopsticks. DEEE-FREAKIN-LISH. It could have used a lil salt, but that's just me being picky. The 3 sweet dipping sauces helped. Next time, I wanna try the duck sumibiyaki.   Since I had a $50 gift card (that I purchased from the radio promos for $25), I had another $10 to use up so I ordered the shrimp skewers wrapped in crispy noodles. The crispy noodles were like deep fried chow mein noodles. Interesting, but good.   Stuffed like a pig, I paid and waddled out w/ my leftovers in tow.

On the first and third Thursdays of the month, Ben Avery offers lessons for women. You get to take three classes for free (skeet, trap and sport). And by free, I mean COMPLETELY FREE. They give you a box of rounds, shotgun rental, clays, ear/eye protection and awesome instructors. After your first 3 lessons, you can continue to join the class, but you have to buy your own clays and rounds.    Fred the range master (in charge of the program) is awesome and so is LeRoy (he's in charge of the first-time visitors). And the ladies from Desert Rose that instruct the return visitors are so helpful.   Make sure you sign up in advance for the classes though. Space is limited.

Ordered a new line of service last night online. Verizon is running a free overnight promo, but apparently they won't allow Saturday deliveries. No biggie since I still have my phone/service from AT&T, right? WRONG! Verizon apparently ported over my # this morning from AT&T even though I won't receive the new cell phone until Monday. WTF. I called the VZN's 800#, FedEx and the Happy Valley store.. all to no avail. No one "could" do anything about it. 800# rep even got a little hostile with me saying it's MY fault for ordering it so late on a Thursday night. Wow.    Since I'm phone-less for the next few days, I'll have some time to reconsider whether or not I want to be on the IN network. B*STARDS.  Tip: Change your porting process. Wait until the customer receives and activates the new phone, pleeeeeeeeeease!

Mr. Gyros is my go-to place when the fridge is empty. Not only is it conveniently located right around the corner from my house, but the gyro sandwiches are pretty tasty. The chicken souvlaki sandwich is good too when I wanna switch things up. The sandwiches are usually packed with plenty of meat and sauce so I have leftovers. One word of caution, even though the Greek Pita Melt (under finger foods) lists gyro meat and chicken slices among the other options, (which makes it sound like a steal at $4.75), it is an upcharge. I think it's an extra $2, so it's not such a great deal considering the "finger food" costs more than a sandwich.   The guys behind the counter are always friendly and hook me up w/ the 10% off discount even though I somehow always forget to bring the coupon.   I definitely prefer Mr Gyros over the abundant Subway (we have 3 in Anthem!), Quizno's and the millions of pizza shops.   If you see a German Shepherd waiting hugrily outside of the shop, say hi! He won't bite.. unless you tease him with your gyro. JK! ;-)

C&R is my go-to place when I need repairs done locally. Once, I was quoted more than another shop in Phx, but C&R was willing to do some research on how to replace the part easier, thus reducing my labor costs (by a few hundred dollars).   Extra star for being VERY supportive of local charities & organizations.  Thanks, Ralph!!! You & the crew rock!

Visited Koi for the AYCE special to celebrate a friend's bday. The menu is extensive, but the rolls are all more or less the same. The items came out slowly, sometimes with too much rice packed on so I wadded up some of it in my napkins. I felt guilty for wasting, but I didn't want to get charged for leftovers on my plate.  It's kind of tacky how they ask for proof when celebrating a bday, but I guess it's necessary to weed out the fakers. My friend got a free dessert and they gave us some wigs & boas to wear for our Polaroid picture that they posted on the wall.   I wouldn't return since it wasn't that great of a deal and the food was mediocre. I could go to a real sushi restaurant and pay $30/person to get higher quality sushi.

Bogi is the BEST. She is very knowledgeable, friendly, helpful and most importantly-- HONEST. My BMW was towed to a shop in Anthem bc 180 is closed on the wkends. I was quoted +$800 to replace the fuel pump. I called Bogi and she quoted me several hundred dollars less. After explaining to her that my car was undriveable and determining that it probably wouldn't be worth it to have it towed down to her, she taught my local mechanic how to fix it easier and she even hooked him up w/ her discount for the part bc she has more purchasing power. WHAT?!?!? I couldn't believe it either.   I've referred my friends to her and they have all been satisfied with the work. Give 180 Auto a try.. you won't regret it! Oh yeah, she gives a loaner car too if needed so you aren't totally out of commission for the day.

Madelyn's closed during the holidays of '08 for a "family emergency" and never reopened at the start of this year.  I'm really going to miss the happy hour specials, mac n cheese, pumpkintinis and James, the awesome bartender.   It's for sale on Craigslist if anyone is interested in reviving one of the few (if not only) gems in Anthem!

-1 for the handful of gnats hovering above our table  -1 for the dingy smell inside the restaurant -1 for the dirty cloth napkins -2 for the awful tasting tacos ("lobster" and chorizo con pappas)*  -1 for the practically virgin banana colada  * lobster is in quotes because i highly doubt it was real lobster. it tasted more like what imitation krab is to real crab. oddly crunchy, chewy and trasparent.   i would've left if i were on my own, but i was with two friends that wanted to try it out and we had a groupon. personally, i never plan on setting foot in this place again. i want to gag just thinking about it!

Food and ambiance at Saddle Ranch area really 2.5 stars at most, but the service and drinks are always on point. I work right around the corner @ the Galleria, so my co-workers and I have had many lunches here. Our group averages about 12-15 people, and usually, that would mean bad service and/or messed up orders. Not here at Saddle! Our drinks are never empty, food is always brought to the right person and the servers check on us regularly. Occasionally there are 2 servers, but it's usually just 1 and he/she always executes it all flawlessly. He/she also never has a problem splitting the bill. At the end of the meal, the manager usually hooks us up w/ free dessert!   I've also been here many times at night w/ friends. We have a bartender friend so it's a great deal. ;-)

I'm always looking for a new sushi restaurant to try out so I was excited to see Pearl on the list of 1/2 off gift certificates available through the radio station. Not only did I buy one for myself, but I forwarded the info to my friends so we could all try out a new place together-- at a discounted price.   Unfortunately, we should have clarified their policy before we all bought our own gift certificates. Pearl does not do split checks so therefore, we weren't able to use more than 1 gift certificate per table. I respect their policy and that disappointment is NOT reflected in my rating.   Now on with the review-----   I had plans to meet with some friends for drinks in Old Town on a Saturday night so I figured that'd be the perfect night for my friend & I to try out Pearl. I called to see if reservations were necessary and the hostess said they don't accept reservations for small parties and assured us that we shouldn't have a problem getting seated around 9pm. OK, so when we arrive, there is a large party on the patio and the inside is crowded. There is a small table for two available inside and a group of 3 are leaving a table next to the open table for two. The host says we could wait at the small table while they clear off the larger table for us. Once it's cleared, we scooch over and peruse the menu. Shortly after, the host comes over again and informs us that both tables are reserved. OK?!?! WTF. I thought they don't take reservations for small groups?! He says the sushi bar is open; otherwise, we'll have to wait for another table to clear up. Irritated, we move over to the sushi bar since we were pressed for time and had to get dinner started already.   After a few minutes, we handed our check list over to the friendly sushi chef. He quickly whips out our rolls one after another each one presented beatifully. Unfortunately, looks were very deceiving.  Sizzle Yellow Tail (pico de gallo and a roasted jalapeno miso vinaigrette drizzled w/ hot extra virgin olive oil): no flavor; just tasted like oily hamachi. Big disappointment since hamachi is one of my favorite sashimis.   Napoleon Dynamite roll (tempura shrimp and cucumber rolled and topped with baked lobster dynamite, green onions and drizzled with a sweet soy glaze): waaaaay too much mayo in the "lobster" (it's really crawfish.. I hate when sushi restaurants misrepresent items!) dynamite. I couldn't stomach it.   Surf & Turf roll (shrimp tempura, grilled king mushrooms and cucumber rolled and topped with seared beef tenderloin and a sesame oil vinaigrette): the beef tenderloin was flavorless. Didn't notice any mushrooms in the roll.   Sunset Strip roll (spicy yellowtail, cream cheese, cucumber, avocado and daikon sprouts rolled and topped with salmon, thinly sliced lemon, ponzu sauce and a wasabi lime aioli): spicy yellowtail lacked heat. Couldn't really pinpoint what else was lacking, but it was just really flavorless.   All in all, we put down a good majority of what we ordered. Not because it tasted good, but because we wanted a full belly so we could handle more drinks later that night. =) They have some really good promotions so I might be willing to give them another shot. I'd stay away from the rolls and sizzling sashimi.. and just order the sushi/regular sashimi since those rely solely on the quality and flavor of the fish itself. I would not pay full price here though.

My friend works across the street from the Happy Valley plaza so we frequently meet in the area for dinner. Sauce is usually the first place I suggest since I prefer it far more than the other (crappy) chains nearby. The pizzas and salads are good, the prices are right and the atmosphere is nice & casual. Service is pretty good considering they don't have a "real" waitstaff.   Just noticed two pizzas that I'll have to try next time: wild mushroom + truffled arugula and prosciutto + melon.

I was able to schedule Camelback Moving on short notice, on the weekend day & time that I needed. The two movers arrived on time and were ready to work.   Both were very efficient, thorough and careful. While one guy was disassembling my CA king bed frame, the head board fell on him (luckily, it's padded!) and knicked my wall. He was very honest and apologetic. I told him not to worry since I was going to touch up all the paint anyways.   They loaded and unloaded everything in a timely manner.. even though alot of my stuff was pack haphazardly. I would not hesitate to use the company again!

After sampling the "premium" flavor at the Berry Good location in Peoria, I walked out w/o purchasing anything because it was not tart. I asked the worker if they planned on carrying tart flavors and she said they tried it a few weeks before, but it didn't sell well.. so no.   Fast forward a few months later (last weekend) and I'm visiting my friend in Avondale. She tells me about Berry Good in Goodyear and convinces me that theirs is tart and it's self-serve (Peoria's wasn't when I visited). Excited to get some tart fro-yo, we drive over there and I rush to sample the "premium" and the "strawberry banana" that she had been raving about. ICK it was cloyingly too sweet. Once again, I leave empty handed and disappointed.   I really hope Berry Good makes their plain actually tart.. especially because they're opening up a new location right by my house. PLEASE OH PLEASE MAKE IT TART! I will be a loyal customer if you do!

stopped in on a beautiful saturday afternoon. i tried the cheese course duo (not bad, but didn't stand out to me), lime basil (very refreshing)., real mint chip, salted caramel and ended up sharing  a scoop of bacon brittle and sweet corn w/ a friend. bacon brittle was very good, but i just wish there were more bacon brittle pieces. i like my ice cream chunky! the ice cream base itself was good and creamy, but kind of plain. sweet corn was also good, but didn't wow me.   i tried a friend's melon duo sorbet.. it was soooo refreshing and tasty! he was totally contemplating about getting another scoop. another friend got the billy goat (chocolate ice cream made w/ goat's milk) and he really liked it too. he said it's really rich and he was jonesing for another scoop as well.   can't wait to go back and try more interesting flavors!

They use frozen fruit now. The mango (topping) and colored jellies tasted funky. Mochi is still too soft. Froyo melts quicker than normal still. Tasted like it was from a powdered mix. ICK. I don't plan on going back again.

Wildflower is one of my go-to lunch spots. They have delicious sandwiches, soups and bread.  Some of my favorite choices are:   Turkey breast & brie on 9 grain roasted sweet potato (no fennel) on 9 grain  roast beef & gorgonzola on 9 grain  potato cream cheese soup   Service is always friendly and fast too which really helps during the crazy lunch rushes.

I was debating between OTFM and DPPM for my first (real) AZ farmers market experience (I checked out the one at El Encanto Dos off Carefree Hwy a few weeks ago, but that one sucked big time so I think that hardly qualifies as a farmers mkt). After asking the helpful Yelpers on Talk, I decided that my aunt & I would go to OTFM and save DPPM for next time.   We arrived around 11:15am and easily found parking at the 1st Ave x Brown parking lot. After a quick two block walk, we were delighted to see the rows of tents. Our first stop was McClendon produce where I picked up a golden beet ($2/lb), a red beet ($2/lb), a bundle of Tuscan Kale (I think it was $2), a pomelo ($2.50??) , a cup of basil ($2) and four tomatoes ($3.50/lb).   While waiting for my aunt, I meandered over to the jelly stand. After sampling various flavors, I purchased a $6 jar of tangerine marmalade that I think would go fantastic w/ rack of lamb (I usually use orange marm).   After my aunt paid for her huge basket of produce, the cashier guy was kind enough to let us leave some stuff behind their area while we cont'd to shop.   Our next stop was a nondescript booth that apparently made fresh mozzarrella on site. Oh joy!! It was so delicious when the sample was topped with a little pesto! We picked up a tub each. Pricey at $8 each, but we couldn't resist.  As we continued our lap around the area, we picked up canned albacore & salmon ($8 each), 2 loaves of bread ($3 each) from the Phoenician (sooo bummed I didn't get to try the chocolate cherry bread bc they were out of it, but that's a great excuse to see the cute worker again ;-) ), 1/2 a dozen tamales ($11) and a scoop of cantaloupe sorbet from the Sweet Republic truck ($3). We would've gotten a small bottle of balsamic vinegar ($18), but they were out of the flavor that we liked most (raspberry).   All in all, OTFM is considerably smaller than what I'm used to in CA (SF & LA), but it was still enjoyable nonetheless. The weather was beautiful yesterday and I got to sample some local flavor. I'd definitely visit again even if it's 45mins away.   BTW: the strawberries from McClendon have a wonderful strawberry frangrance, but they aren't very sweet. Neither is the pomelo. The sourdough is good. The tamale was very flavorful but a bit salty (I think it was the Tex Mex one that I ate?? It's flavored ground meat w/ a hunk of cheese in it). I ate some cold mozzarrella w/ the tamale to subdue the saltiness. I can't wait to make a caprese salad later!!! That's all I've tried so far.....

I've only been to Avalon once, but I can easily see it becoming one of my favorite restaurants. I was really disappointed when I found out they were out of scallops, but my mahi mahi was really delicious and my best friend's ribeye was even BETTER! It was seriously one of the best ribeyes that I've tasted in awhile. Note that their website menu is outdated I think. The mahi mahi is not listed and my friend's ribeye was different from what's on online.  The service was good, atmosphere was nice & trendy, and the breadbasket w/ garlicky dip was uniquely yummy! Only nuisance was an odd odor encountered upon entering the restaurant.   I really don't understand why we were only one of a few occupied tables that Saturday evening. I can't wait to go back!

Treated myself to some froyo last night after a 2.25hrs workout. The place had a steady stream of customers on a Monday night around 9pm.. pretty impressive!   After requesting quite a few samples from the worker (Butterfinger--good, tart appletini--ok, tart acai berry--good, pomegranate raspberry--ok and plain tart--good), I decided on the tart acai berry and plain tart. I topped it off with a log of baklava, mochi, coconut and a lil sprinkle of granola for good measure. I was surprised that my total came out to around $4.50 even though I didn't get much.. must have been the log of baklava! Anyhow, I requested the Yelp discount and the older lady had no clue what I was talking about. A line of impatient customers starting to form behind me as I was trying to explain to her what Yelp is and about the special that I saw being offered. Finally, she asked two workers and the 2nd person was able to clue her in.   Overall, the place is really clean and the froyo was good, albeit a little icier than what I like. And I would have preferred it if the baklava were crushed. This is close to my house so I would go back as long as the 20% off is being offered. $.45/oz is considerably higher than its local competitors.

On Monday around 11:30am, my aunt, niece & I stopped by to check out the new restaurant that had opened in the Happy Valley plaza (the newer one w/ Best Buy). After going past the first set of doors, we were greeted by a Japanese armor suit behind a glass case. It was interesting to look at and my 7 year old niece got a kick out of it.   As we walked towards our table for 3, we noticed that the restaurant was HUGE and only a handful of tables were occupied and 1 family at the teppanyaki table.   I decided on the steak lunch, my aunt had the chicken & scallop lunch and my niece had salmon sashimi w/ sushi rice. The fried rice was pretty tasty, the pieces of steak were juicy and the grilled veggies were good. For dessert, my niece ordered green tea ice cream. It ended up taking way longer than we expected so we had to flag down our waitress to remind her. Three heaping scoops drizzled w/ berry & chocolate syrups were soon brought out.   Teppanyaki restaurants are rarely ever very authentic, but Ah-So is pretty good for what it is.   3.5* but rounded up for the good service and cleanliness. The busboy was very prompt w/ clearing our empty bowls/dishes and refilling our waters.

good things come to those who wait and the coffee from sola is definitely one of them. each cup of coffee is individually brewed so just make sure you have a few extra minutes to spare.    their soy chai lattes are also really delicious.. mmmm... just thinking about it makes me want one.   cheaper. tastes better. true indie vibe. definitely the best coffee house around.  one gripe: no one answers at the phone number listed on the website so i wasn't able to place my order in advance.

I had a flat tire on the 101 today with no usable spare. Roadside assistance dispatched my call to Quik Pik and Michael was on the scene in 20 mins. He towed my car to Costco, but they didn't have my tires in stock. So, he graciously towed it across the way to C&R Tire. To make matters worse, C&R was already closed for the day so I had to leave my car overnight, but I did not have a ride home. After making several futile attempts, I heard a knock on my car window. Startled, I peered over and saw Michael's kind face. He said he didn't feel right leaving me alone in the parking lot at night w/o a definite ride home and OKed it w/ his office to drop me off. What a lifesaver!   Thanks again, Quik Pik and Michael, for quickly picking up this damsel in distress and (literally) going out of your way!!   Hopefully, you don't need a tow truck, but if you ever do, I'd highly recommend Quik Pik.

This is where I go to get my nails "did." Usually the wait times are short, pedicures are quick and well done and the prices are cheap. It's a little ghetto, but it's clean. $2 off Mondays-Wednesdays.   And the $4 denim alterations are good. It's usually about a 2-3 day turnaround time, sooner if requested.

My friend celebrated her birthday here yesterday evening. We were the first three of about 15 people to show up. The server was really inconsistent and scatterbrained. As soon as we were seated, she asked us if we were ready to order drinks. After telling her we needed some time, she came back two minutes later to ask again. We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose.   10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. While waiting for our orders, more people started to trickle in. By the time she came back to our table, there were about 10+ people passing around 1 happy hour menu. Either that was the only copy in the whole restaurant or she didn't want us to order from it because as soon as someone set it down, she snatched it up and took off w/ it. WTH!?   While everyone was laughing about it and asking "did that really just happen?!" our food arrived. My friend & I shared the pork belly cubano and chicken fingers. Both were OK, but they should have just named the pork belly cubano a ham cubano because the piece of pork belly was no larger than 2 fingers. A total disappointment because I was looking forward to the pork belly the most! As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people's half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.  There were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table. When they brought out the orders, they would just drop off the plates wherever they felt like. Sometimes they would drop it off at one end of the table, sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the other end. Never once did they ask who it belonged to. When one dish was brought to my friend, she gave him a puzzled look and he started to walk away. She said "I guess I can figure out who this belongs to.." and he came back and said "well I guess I can do it if you don't want to..." WTF. Isn't it his JOB to?!?   My friend said she had a very similar experience last time too. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a shame since I work right across the street and my co-workers and I eat out almost everyday.

I work in the Galleria so I was really hoping I'd like this place. After a couple of visits over the past year, I've come to the conclusion that this place is just not for me. My stomach always feels odd after eating here and I just don't find the food all that appealing.

The first time I was there (a few months ago), I received very good service (4 stars). They gladly took care of a whole bunch of stuff (some identified by me, some by them and some by the computer) covered under warranty and provided a complimentary loaner vehicle.   However, I have to deduct 2 stars because I was misinformed this past weekend and it cost me $500 that I should not have had to spend!!!   I called them about my serpentine drive belt that started to unravel while I was on the road in the East Valley. They said the belt falls under the maintenance category which is warrantied up to 50k miles. I have 53k; therefore, I'm not covered. To have them repair it, it would cost $500. In a bind, I quickly called my trusted local shop and they said it'd be $200 so I figured the choice was easy and drove down to them. On my way over, the belt had unraveled so much that it wrapped around the power steering pulley so I lost power steering (which cost me an additional $300 to fix).   Fast forward to today, I'm at Chapman on Camelback for an unrelated issue. I mention to my SA what happened over the weekend and he said it would have been covered under my manufacturer warranty of 55k miles which I still qualify for and the belt normally lasts til at least 100k miles. WTF!  I am now waiting to hear back from Chapman on Camelback as to whether or not they are going to reimburse me for the $500 that I spent all because I was misinformed by Chandler. I gave my SA a copy of the invoice and I just found a BMW bulletin online regarding this issue so I'm really hoping they do the right thing.

I purchased a couple of Groupons awhile back and have had great experiences up until this past Tuesday. After 3 days in Vegas, I was eager to get home for some rest. Upon check-out, I patiently waited for the attendant to check me out as he was helping an incoming customer with his intake ticket. When he entered the booth, I handed him my parking ticket and smartphone with my Groupon already on the screen. After thumbing through their book of Groupon customers, he found my listing, ran my ticket and advised me that it'd be $5 after the Groupon. I asked how much time I had gone over as I know I was only parked for 72 hours. He advised me, "40 SECONDS." I asked again just to make sure I heard clearly and he reconfirmed, "40 SECONDS." I inquired as to why I'd have to pay $5 for a mere 40 SECONDS and he said the computer automatically pro-rates the fees and there was NO way he could adjust it. I think it's absurd considering it took him a good few minutes to even process my check-out and was completely unsympathetic of the ridiculous charge.   I just accepted a new job where I will be flying every week. I was planning on parking at Blue Sky, but now I need to find a new lot. Those measley $5 that they charged me just cost them a frequent customer.  *Looks like I'm not the only one that has experienced this either.

I received a very nice message from the owner. I really appreciate his effort in researching the situation and defending his business in a polite and professional manner so I'm updating my review.    It turns out the attendant I dealt with that day misspoke-- I was over by 40 minutes. He must have been having an off day because I asked twice and even repeated back, "40 seconds," to him.   Anyhow, I plan on giving Blue Sky another chance as all other experiences were good and the owner made a very valiant effort to make amends. All other business owners should take note when a less than desirable review is written by a customer. Thanks again, Blue Sky! I'll be seeing you again soon.   Will update with a 5* if the next few visits go well.

I love everything I've ever tried here---- scallop dish, mac n cheese, pastrami pork belly, lamb sandwich, grilled cheese and of course, the infamous chopped salad. Yum, I'm drooling just thinking about it all! They also make a delicious Moscow Mule cocktail.   I've always made reservations so have never had to wait. Staff has always been attentive, courteous and prompt.   I just wish they had a more appealing and reasonably priced dessert menu.

The most scrumptious pizza I have ever tasted out of a truck; and it beats many traditional pizza restaurants as well. I tried the "Hottie" this past Friday at Food Truck Friday. Although the serrano peppers and jalapenos were not as spicy as I expected, the sausage, crust and cheese were deeelicious. Yum, I'm drooling just thinking about it.   Can't wait til the next Food Truck Friday. Now if only my stomach were big enough for Pizza People AND Short Leash Dog, I'd be a very happy gal!

Cute casual atmosphere for breakfast or lunch. Service is friendly and there is plenty of seating available including a communal table. I've had the breakfast burrito (twice), brisket sandwich and chicken sandwich. All are good, but I liked the brisket sandwich best.   This morning, I ordered the breakfast burrito. It tasted no different than the last time: nice, crispy hash browns, chorizo, eggs and cheese. After polishing off about 2/3 of it (over the course of 2 meals), I took a bite and felt a foreign object in my mouth. Upon pulling it out, I realized it was a piece of plastic. Not sure if their chorizo is encased in a plastic tube, but regardless, it has no business in a burrito. Unfortunately, I'm at home and they are already closed so I can't bring it back. Hopefully they check Yelp and are more cautious going forward. I posted a picture to the album for anyone who cares to see said foreign object.   Normally I would've given 4 stars, but because of this, I'm giving 2.

Kudos to the owner for handling my last review with such grace. He sent me a very sincere message assuring me necessary precautions were being taken to prevent the mishap from happening again. Unfortunately, I won't be back anytime soon not because I don't want to, but because I can't--- I've since moved out of state. I will definitely stop by for lunch if/when I visit Arizona again.   I have no doubt the Cafeteria will succeed under Bryan's ownership. If only all business owners could be like him!
