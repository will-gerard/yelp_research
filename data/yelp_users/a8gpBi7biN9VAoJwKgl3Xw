As a newbie runner, I had no idea where to start looking for shoes. I am such a noob, that I hurt my ankle while running in $30 cross trainers. A friend recommended Runner's Den so I came in for their free running injury clinic and I'm so happy I did!  The Doctor was nice and very thorough and helpful. He gave me a few stretches to do and recommended a pair of shoes that would be appropriate for me (which was the same as the Runner's Den employee suggested while I was waiting to see the doctor, so sounds like they were spot on!) This was great, because my inner hypochondriac had already convinced my brain that I'd eventually have to amputate. Turns out my prognosis isn't that grim.  All the employees I spoke with were nice, helpful and extremely knowledgeable. I know a lot of people complained about higher prices, but I looked up how much the shoes I picked up were going for online, and the prices were exactly the same on all the major websites (eastbay, amazon, footlocker, etc) so clearly I'd rather support a local business! I'm sure prices vary with the different shoes, but the one I was looking at wasn't any cheaper anywhere else which was nice.  It's a good 30 mile drive for me, so I don't think I'll just hop in for random little things, but for major purchases like shoes or a sports bra, it's worth the drive!

Sushi has always been a safe option for me as a veggie. Even though I'm not crazy about sushi itself, I can always have delicious sides like tempura vegetables, (some) miso soup, etc. Zen 32 totally came through in that department, and I was even impressed with the sushi I did try. I had a veggie roll with soy paper, and it was actually really delicious. I probably would have ate it all if I hadn't already stuffed myself with the spring rolls, miso soup, edamame and a sake bomber!  The atmosphere was really chill and the outdoor seating was really nice- I loved the color change pillars.   Everything I had was tasty, and the service was friendly and prompt. I'm absolutely looking forward to coming back!

I washed and washed.... but the dirt wont come off!   I was an avid skater years ago so when I read about a Yelp event at Skateland I couldn't possibly resist. Plus, it was a Monday- I'm sure it wouldn't be busy!  WRONG.  I waited in line for almost 30 minutes carrying my heavy skates and standing between two sick children that their [teenage] mothers should have never taken out of the house, let alone skating.  Once I paid my entry charge, I went right in since I had my own skates. It looked like the skate line was another hefty wait.  The layout of the building is a bit odd in comparison to other places I've skated- there are a lot of drop offs and stairs that can be tricky to navigate in skates. The rink doesn't have a wall for the most part, so there's no safety blanket for those just starting out.   There was little order or rule enforcement from employees leaving the floor jam packed with some less than desirable conditions going on. There were a few injuries while I was there, even one bad enough to clear the rink.   At the end of the night, a kid barfed in the middle of the seating area, and it was an act of congress to get anyone to clean it up.... the DJ had to announce it over the PA system to get anyone's attention. Gross.  That being said, I had a great time at the event, but it was likely because of the good company. I'll give this place another shot, maybe during the week... but I'll likely try the Chandler location first.

I worked at this Nords for the better part of a year, so I speak with both the perspective of a former employee AND a consumer.  Chandler Norstrom is a great place full of great people who are eager to go above and beyond for the customers. I have never had anything less than stellar shopping experience here. The people who weren't top notch tended to weed themselves out pretty quickly.  Aside from cosmetics (where I spent most of my time), everyone I shopped with upstairs and in shoes or handbags was equally as great.   My only reason for docking a star is that this Nordstrom is not an "old school" Nordstrom... There is something to be said about the class and prestige that comes with running a location in the "Nordstrom way" which I felt this location often lacked.  Pro tip- try the mocha banana ice storm at the cafe... It'll change your life.

I mean srsly... who doesn't love a communal wash area?!  Liberty Market is easily not only my favorite East Valley Eatery, but just plain hang out spot. The wifi, quality coffee, smiling employees and friendly service are only a fraction of what makes this place awesome. It's attention to detail, delicious eats and creative vibe are second to none. I deeply appreciate how involved they are in the community, and the owner Joe is always a tweet or email away and always has a smile and something nice to say.  I look back fondly on my unemployed summer of '09 as much of it was spent drinking soy lattes at the E61 bar and chatting it up with friends over salads and desert at Liberty Market.   Joe, keep up the good work!

From the front office staff to the providers and the doctor herself, Van Dyke Laser is really the premier cosmetic dermatology practice in the valley. I've had a full range of treatments here- injectables, IPL, laser hair removal, Cool Sculpting- and they have all been fantastic. Especially laser hair removal- I've had great results and not having to shave my underarms more than a few times a month is a blessing, especially in the summer! You would think the costs would be high since it's in Paradise Valley, but it's really comparable to other places- plus the office staff help you use manufacturer rebates to get the best deal possible.

I brought my little chihuahua in for a bath and brush. The places right near my house were booked up, but Shelly's got me right in. That was great and I appreciated the fast service but there were a couple things that were troubling. I dropped off my dog and they just said, "ok thanks, see you in an hour!" I didn't realize it until I drove off, but they didn't collect a single piece of contact information- no name, phone number or anything. What if something happened to my dog? They'd have no way to let me know. This worried me a bit. Next, they are cash only and of course I didn't notice the sign until I came back to pick her up. It was annoying to have to track down an ATM at the Walgreens down the street, especially because I was on a little bit of a time crunch at that point. It's not the end of the world, but the cash only concept bothers me- credit card fees are a cost of doing business. Sorry, but thems the breaks. I'd rather they charged a buck or two more to cover the fees. So FYI- bring cash.  Anyway, what really matters is my dog came home smelling fresh with nicely clipped nails. I'll probably end up going elsewhere due to so many other places being closer to my home and accepting credit cards, but would still go back to Shelly's in the case of the others not being able to get me in.

I don't know if I can ever buy produce at my regular grocery store again. Blackberries for 89 cents?? Three pounds of apples for a DOLLAR? Seriously?! I love it!   I got a juicer for Christmas so this place has seen a lot of me. I never thought I'd be able to fill an entire cart full of fresh produce for $17. It makes my new juicing habit totally affordable. I've never had so many greens in my diet!  I thought about taking a star off for some of the items being either a bit old or a bit unripe... but I couldn't do it. It's not that much work to pick through a few items, and I really haven't had to do it that much at all.  Fresh fruit, veg and local items like jam, honey and candy. Really, I'm in love with this place. So absolutely worth the drive to East Mesa.

I've learned the hard way that pools are for rich people. I, being rather "not rich" have to maintain my pool on a pretty tight budget. Corson's has the most reasonably priced pool supplies I've found, and they don't mind telling me where I can cut corners.  Being from Alaska, I am complete pool n00b. They always have answers to my stupid questions, and I have yet to come across an employee at this location who doesn't know his stuff. Most of them are pretty easy on the eyes, too... which never hurts.  They do a lot of repairs and I'm about to take my crappy old pool vac there to see if they can salvage it!

One of my favorite restaurants in South Scottsdale. It's a go-to date night choice for my fiance and I. Romantic atmosphere, AMAZING food and the owner is really nice and always stops by your table to check up on how things are going. One word of advice though- come hungry, and save room for dessert. The Nutella Banana dessert is out of this world! Get it with a scoop of ice cream and thank me later ;)

I wanted to like this place. I really did. A rice bowl is something fairly easy to do right, and I can't say that Shogun Express did so. It's unfortunate, because they're one of my favorite quick and easy dinners and I would have eaten here often if it had been even slightly palatable.  I got a fried tofu and veggie rice bowl and just about everything except the teriyaki sauce was below par. The rice wasn't the yummy sticky rice- it was just bland and squishy. The breading around the tofu tasted like raw flour and the only "veggie" I got was broccoli (which was at least not over cooked)  I only managed to force down half of it.   My friend who ordered a hibachi steak teryiaki bowl suffered from crippling stomach pains later in the night. Plus, he said the meat was chewy and low quality.   I don't think I'm going back any time soon. The only thing that makes that a possibility is Jennifer's review that said their salads were amazing... If they make them without chicken I might be willing to give that a try.

edit: I had to knock this place down a star. I feel like it has gotten even worse recently. They don't even have the spray bottles to clean the machines anymore- just paper towels and a weird solution coming out of a soap dispense on the wall that NO ONE SEEMS TO USE. EVER. It's like people think it's hand soap and don't touch it. I'm going to try driving south to the location in Tempe (which sucks, because I live like a freaking mile from this one) and if that isn't better I'm changing gyms. I don't feel like getting MRSA.   I don't really have a lot of NEW information to share about this place that hasn't been said already, so here's my bottom line.   Is this gym gross, dirty and smelly? Yes. Are there a lot of obnoxious people there more interested in socializing than exercising? Yes. Will this stop me from working out there? No.   It's close to me, it's cheap and there's no contract. There's lots of classes offered. Until I can afford a membership at some super classy exclusive place, LA Fitness will most certainly serve it's purpose- to keep me from getting fat.

Nails are one of my small indulgences- a monthly pedicure keeps my toes in sandal condition during the summer. Historically I haven't had much loyalty to one nail place or another- but this one might change that. I saw Kevin for my appointment, and not only did he do a a fantastic job, but he was personable and nice to talk to.   The place was clean and my wait time was minimal. A basic mani/pedi combo was only $35, which is a steal if you ask me! I'll definitely be back.   It gets five stars because if you're comparing it to other strip mall nail places, it's as good as it gets! I figure that's a lot more fair than comparing it to Dolce or the Phoenician.

This is my absolute favorite place to do karaoke! Ted is a kick ass KJ and always makes the night a hoot.   While the song selection is good, there's a few of my favorites it's missing but I am never at a shortage of options. The wait is never long and the crowd is great for people watching.   The place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is much better than your typical bar fare.   I've yet to have a lame Friday night at JJ's. It's a great place to bring a crowd of friends, let loose, do some singing or just laugh at the craziness that inevitably ensues at a karaoke bar.

Dear Defalco's,,  I'm sorry I didn't give you a fair shot sooner. The first time I visited you there must have been something "interesting" cooking and the smell turned me right around and I didn't want to come back.   I finally got over it months later and gave you a try, and I'm glad I did. Your "vegetarian" sandwich wasn't just lettuce, mayo and cheese. It was overflowing with yummy veggies like carrots, onions and avocado and tasty italian dressing. The wheat roll was crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Unfortunately some peppers from another area in the deli case made their way into my fruit salad, and my lemon bar tasted bland and bitter. Other than that, I'm glad I gave you another chance and I will surely be back again. Maybe pizza and a more authentic italian desert next time.  Kind regards,  Molly

I absolutely love the sandwiches here. I don't think I've ever tasted anything that was short of fantastic- from the side dishes to the variety of sweet munchies such as the Captain Crunch or Fruity Pebble treats. I only knock a star off for the fact that I have to "get over" the theme. It's kinda funny, sure, but it makes me feel a little skeezy to eat at a weed-themed restaurant. At least it knows it's nitch and doesn't try and be anything it's not- it's an inexpensive sandwich shop near a college campus that serves brownies and kool-aid.   That aside, I still regularly enjoy their food despite their hippie atmosphere and often take out of town guests here (provided they're not TOO uptight, of course).   It's one of those places that, regardless of your feeling on the theme, you should probably at least try once.

Apparently, I'm BANNED from this Buffalo Exchange.   How does one get banned from a Buffalo Exchange?  Did I punch one of the snotty hipsters for not thinking my $200 article of clothing is worth $6? Did I toss over a rack of musty knock off handbags in a fit of rage? Did I curse out a bored looking guy with flippy hair and an ironic mustache?  Nope, I wasn't even in the store.  I accidentally sold a pair of pants that my boyfriend didn't want sold. He called immediately (within 20 minutes of me leaving the store) and said that he'd be in the next day to pick them up. He had the receipt, and the assistant manager said that would be okay. Well, upon him arriving at the store to complete this previously agreed upon transaction, the same manager decided this wasn't okay and said that he had to buy the pants at retail price. While I'm leaving out some of the mind boggling back and forth that went on, I'll sum it up as the level of poor customer service and rude behavior displayed by the "management" of the store was shocking.   While my boyfriend never raised his voice, lost his cool or got flustered, the manager decided because he made her stand by what she had originally agreed on, he was "NEVER ALLOWED BACK IN THIS STORE AGAIN"   "OR YOUR GIRLFRIEND EITHER!!!!"  So there you have it. Banned from Buffalo Exchange. Funny, I haven't lost any sleep over it.

Went here for brunch while in Vegas for a work trip turned vacay. I am annoyed I have suffered so many overpriced yet sub standard breakfast buffets when this place was just around the corner and at a fraction of the price! This will be our go-to place from now on! While the huge menu was a bit overwhelming, we stuck with our favorites and weren't disappointed. I had the coconut chicken and waffles and it was out of this world... plus a side of what may have been the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. I also had a few bites of the french toast, which was so flavorful I couldn't believe it. I'm looking forward to my next hungover vegas morning simply so I can pour myself into a booth with my sunglasses on and indulge in some incredible breakfast food at Blueberry Hill.

I stayed here for a recent business trip and found it to be a breath of fresh air in otherwise smokey Las Vegas :)  When you go to Vegas for fun, a casino in your hotel is not just fun, it's convenient! You're going for the party and the night life, so that's to be expected. When you go to Vegas for business, all that stuff can be overwhelming when all you want to do is rest and maybe go out for dinner.   The Renaissance is one of the only smoke free hotels in LV, which is AWESOME... it was so nice to not come home reeking like an ash tray and having to re-wash all my laundry. Plus, this was the first time I came home from Vegas and didn't get sick- which if you ask me, speaks volumes of this hotel's cleanliness.  The gym is clean and nice, and has a lovely stocked (free!) fruit bowl and water. The machines are newer, and some even have video screens built in them.   While the steakhouse (Envy) downstairs was raved about, I had no intention on blowing my entire day's food allowance on once meal so I opted for tapas at the bar. I left full and satisfied, and the cost was much more reasonable.   They lose a star for charging so much for wifi and for the thin walls. Saturday night was tough to get to sleep early when our neighbors came home obviously pretty wasted... plus, hearing alarm clocks in other rooms made for earlier mornings than necessary.  I'll happily stay here again any time and would recommend it to either the business traveler or anyone who doesn't want a smokey casino-like hotel.

I don't like to be a pain in the ass vegetarian, so I rarely will oppose a restaurant suggestion because of my meat-free diet. If my omnivorous friends want to go to a steak house, I always know I can- at the very least- enjoy a salad or french fries.   The Yard House was suggested for a business meeting, so I agreed, not expecting too much and just hoping their fries were good.  I was pleasantly surprised by the "summer salad" option on the menu, and it did not disappoint! It was one of the most flavorful, delicious salads I'd ever had. We also all split a desert- and the Peach and Apple cobbler is ridiculously good, too.  I never had to ask for a refill of my iced tea, and our adorable server was in a really good mood.   Overall, I was impressed with this place and am looking forward to coming back.

After having been in a few times for nothing more than beers and hummus, I finally had dinner here and it was great! The vegetarian Moussaka was to die for- extremely flavorful and well put together. I'm not really adding anything new by raving about the lemon potatoes and the rice pilaf, but yes, they were awesome too.   The service was just okay, but I've had worse. I think the waitress got annoyed with me when I asked her if I in fact received the vegetarian moussaka, when I mistook some pieces of veggie for ground beef when she first brought out my dish. I got a snappy "yes" and she sort of ignored me for the rest of the night. Regardless, my experience was a good one and I'm sure I'll return.

I feel a little behind the curve just now finally reviewing one of Old Town's staples in diet cheatery.   I have [thoroughly] enjoyed the gelato several times, taking advantage of their late hours walking around old town. It has never disappointed, whether I was in a fruity mood (mango and pineapple) or a chocolately indulgent mood (nutella and caramello).   What I didn't know until recently, and what inspired me to finally yelp this place, is the fact that they serve FOOD! And get this- it's GOOD. They have a big, beautiful wood firing oven and they use it to make fresh, authentic Italian style pizzas and flatbread. I, still feigning a "diet", decided to partake in the chopped salad. Loaded with fresh veggies, it's tossed in a tasty dressing and served on a wood fired flat bread. I was in salad heaven. I also tried the pizza, which was delicious and extremely flavorful. You could tell everything was made from scratch- plus, you got to watch it being made. No re-heated cardboard tasting pizza here!  I can't wait to go back and try more of the Pizzas, particularly the BBQ chicken one, which came highly recommended. Obviously, you have to finish your meal with some of their famous gelato. This time, I had salted caramel and chocolate peanut butter. Totally diet friendly, right? Oh well. I'll call it a cheat day.

As a pretty devoted Fry's shopper, I have to say this is one of my least favorite locations. Unfortunately, it's the closest one to me, so I end up there often. It's almost always crowded, the layout is less than intuitive, and I've gotten questionable produce on more than one occasion. The employees are friendly enough, but it's just no comparison to other locations.  By the looks of it outside, it seems like it would be pretty large, but once you get inside it's cramped and the selections seem limited.   I suppose this is mostly things they can't change, but it's enough to make me drive a few miles out of my way to avoid it if I have the time.

D'Lish was a random find for me and a friend, as we were looking for a more palatable option than our standard Dunkin Donuts hangover breakfast. I was surprised to have not heard of it sooner, as it was nearly within walking distance.  I perused their menu on their website, had a game plan then headed in. The seating area is small but not cramped, and is tastefully modern and cozy. The two other girls seated inside with me were both wearing Tori Burch flats, so I knew it was a little more highbrow than your standard hipster hangout. I ordered a vegetarian breakfast burrito, and brought back a classic breakfast burrito for my friend. They were quite tasty- very fresh and not greasy. I also had the "sexy dirty chai" I read so much about (a chai tea with coffee and vanilla) and it lived up to all expectations. I'm craving one right now, as a matter of fact.  Since then, I've also tried their yogurt parfait with fresh seasonal fruit and it was amazing as well. Their bagels are soft and delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying a Bialy sandwich next. Everything I've tried has been of good quality and freshness. I have yet to be disappointed with the food or the friendly service.  My only issue is that I don't think they quite have their "flow" down yet. Both visits took considerably longer than they should have for a small to-go order. It was much faster to phone in my order and pick up at the drive through window, rather than order and wait inside. Plus, when I used the drive through, I didn't even have to put on pants to go get breakfast. Does it get much better than that?

This is one of the places that makes me wish yelp gave half stars- because this one was really on the fence. The food was very good, but the service really knocked it down a star. I feel bad saying that because the lady was really nice, but there was no real "flow" to how my meal was ordered or served. As others mentioned as well, the language barrier was difficult to overcome, but I did end up getting everything I asked for. I ordered a lunch special that came with a sandwich, soup and tea for $4.99. Sounded like a great deal! I also got an order of the hand rolls to take on the road with me, as I was about to trek back to Phoenix after eating. First, my sandwich came out, which I ate quickly as I was extremely hungry. I thought to myself "gee, maybe I shouldn't have gotten those hand rolls. I'm pretty full now..." Then, they came out. I forced myself to eat one because I wanted to try them, and they were very tasty. At this point, I figured she must have forgotten my soup so I asked for a to-go box for my remaining hand rolls. A few minutes later, my soup came out. It looked beautiful- carrots, broccoli, and cabbage in a clear broth. I devoured it, knowing I could use the nutrients after a weekend in Vegas. I was stuffed, but satisfied. I waited awhile for my check which never came, so I just ended up walking up to the counter to ring up. Somehow my meal ended up at $17 even though the lunch special was supposed to be $4.99 and the handrolls were $5.50, but I didn't feel like getting into it. I will agree with some previous reviewers that the whole up-charge for vegan items is pretty bogus. I seriously doubt that they have two batches of every kind of mock-meat, one vegan and one not. My gut tells me it's all the same. Also, the charge to pay with a credit card is pretty lame too. Again, this place was on the fence between getting three or four stars. They'll get four because the food was really good. I just hope they get a better "flow" to the whole dining experience there.

Who doesn't love a cupcake?  I had my first sprinkles experience two years ago, and it was lackluster at best. The red velvet was dry and I left disappointed.  Flash forward to present day, and some Sprinkles cupcakes were dropped off at my office as a thank-you from a vendor. Regardless of my negative experience the first time, I had some... I'm not a communist, who turns down free cupcakes?!  This time the cuppies were moist and delicious. Redemption. They're still not the *best* I've ever had, but they were good enough that I've been back to the bakery since then for a little sugary treat.  The flavor combos are interesting and tasty- I recommend that chocolate banana, the one with marshmallow and carrot cake. I'm sure they're all pretty good, but those stood out to me.  Overall, thumbs up!

While I really do like the food here, the service at this location has been  touch and go. I teetered between a 3 and 4, but they get a four because despite some odd encounters with the wait staff, I'll still suggested it as a dinner spot fairly often.   I could take or leave the pizza, but I have yet to have a bad salad there. My favorite is the thai noodle one- the dressing is amazing!   Their small appetizers can even be enough for a meal, especially if you're in for lunch. I had the sweet corn raviolis and an order of the chips and guac, and I could barely finish it all. Very delicious!

Rarely do I go to Tempe Marketplace without a stop at Cost Plus. The international foods, the furniture, and oh... the CANDY. Oooooh the candy. I lived a short time in Germany as a very small child and all the German candy brings back fond memories. There are candies from all over the world, so if you have a well-traveled sweet tooth, this is your place.  There's great deals to be had on wine, too. Truly something for everyone here- and a fantastic place for unique gifts.  Sign up for their rewards program and they'll email you really great coupons and a $10 gift card on your birthday!

Seriously, could I love this place MORE? I think not. I'm a Whole Foods fan in general, but this store is really great in particular. It's bigger than the Tempe location and always has a good variety of stuff.  I've been known to go there on payday just to kill a few hours and treat myself to fun, healthy stuff I didn't even know existed. Kamut cereal? Sure! Loose leaf rosehip tea? Why not! Coconut milk yogurt? Count me in!  Plus, the hot/cold food bar is to. Die. For.  There's always great veggie/vegan options and the salad fixins are always fresh. If you go on Wednesdays, it's $5.99 a pound instead of $7.99!  I could kill so much time browsing the body products and sniffing essential oils... and I rarely leave without picking up one of their tasty chocolate truffles by the espresso bar.   If you want a fun time to visit, check out East Valley Friday Nights at 6PM the last Friday of the month (#EVFN) for a great evening with the happenin' local social media crowd. I think it's great they host this, and I've had fun both times I've went.  Two enthusiastic thumbs up!

As a Chandlerite, I've been here several times. Every time has been stellar. My sister and I went for tea and noms last Friday, and we split the Bruschetta and a Caprese tower. My mouth was in rapture! The apple pear green tea was tasty and even better after the second steep. We left stuffed but satisfied.  They've really made the space beautiful, and I found myself thinking of reasons to rent out that awesome back room with the rad, artsy chandelier. Maybe for my next birthday.  I give this place two enthusiastic thumbs up.

I was searching for a new stylist after moving to the East Valley from out of state, and yelp pointed me to Beth at White Lotus. The location wasn't too far from where I was staying and it was pretty easy to find. The salon was clean and well lit, and was very busy. I was greeted promptly and was seated with Beth before too long. We talked about my goals of growing my hair out and fixing some of the drastic angles I had when my hair was shorter. I explained my odd hair texture, and she was very receptive. The cut she gave me was great, and the whole time she gave me extremely helpful styling suggestions. She also explained all the products she used, which was nice. White Lotus is a Bumble and Bumble Salon, which is an excellent high end line. It was a bit more expensive than I was hoping ($70 after tip) but all in all, I feel like it was worth it, and I'll be back!

I, as per usual, procrastinated a birthday gift. I found myself at very last minute looking to frame a piece of artwork. Micheal's wanted a two week turnaround time (?!) but they recommended FastFrame for quicker work. I called, and the owner said to get my butt down there ASAP and they'd be able to accommodate me. I flew down with artwork in hand, and Tracy helped me from start to finish. She was conscious of my budget and helped me find a way to display the piece in a way to give me the most visual impact for my dollar. I was able to pick up my finished piece within a few hours, and I was stunned at the quality of the work and how much more the artwork stood out against a beautiful, professional frame and matting.  I can't recommend this place enough, and I'll be back for all my future framing needs.

I was at work one day and I complimented two clients on their adorable dresses, and they both told me they were purchased at Francesca's. Seeing as how once summer hits I'm in almost nothing but dresses, I knew I had to check it out.   They were very reasonably priced and the boutique was very cute. My sales girl was extremely helpful and had me try on a few things I wouldn't have chosen on my own. She was very nice, and a good sales person!  I left without any dresses unfortunately... my one complaint is that a vast majority of them were made of the same thin, clingy material that was really unflattering if you're not stick skinny. For that, I had to take down a star :(  I did leave with some earrings and a book. They had some great unique gift items, so they're a place that's work checking out even if you're not clothes shopping!

You can't walk two feet in this place without bumping into something adorable, whether that's a dress, jewelry or the lovely ladies who work there! I got my hair cut by Sharisa and she did a fantastic job.   This little hole in the wall salon in Mesa not only does great hair, but also has cute, fashion forward clothes and accessories. Plus, the prices are unbelievable! I got a new sundress for $24! There was even a basket of earrings varying in price from $1-$5, and they were nice!   Parking is a little bit of a bummer since it's in downtown Mesa, but that's to be expected. I plan on coming back when I have more time to browse and money to burn. Such a cute combo boutique and salon.

I was lucky enough to be treated to some red velvet cupcakes from Butter and Me, and let me tell you, it was life changing! Red velvet is easily my favorite flavor, and this one was at the top of the pack.   They were delicately decorated and put in a beautiful box with a pink bow. Perfectly presented, I couldn't help but taking pictures!   Plus, Kelly is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet, and as much as I enjoy a Sprinkles cupcake, I'd WAY rather support a local entrepreneur. I can't wait until her storefront is open- I foresee many more Butter and Me cupcakes in my future!

I ordered cupcakes from Butter & Me for my little sister's birthday party, and they were amazing too! Nothing short of perfect. They stole the show on the food table.

This particular review is more about their Karaoke night at the bar inside. I met up with some friends to catch the last few hours of karaoke (Thursdays until 1am). I had never been to this casino- which isn't surprising. I'm not a huge fan of casinos, or gambling in general, really so they're not my first stop for entertainment. This one, however, was surprisingly clean and well kept. Everything looked new, and they even had STAR WARS slot machines. If I had a few bucks cash on me I would have played that in a hot minute.  Anyway, the Karaoke they had there was lots of fun. Tons of good singers (and then there was me). The book was huge but there was only one for the whole bar. I will say it was cool that there weren't any song numbers to worry about- you just wrote your name and the song and they guy pulled it right up. Almost made up for not having the book at your table. It took a way a teeny bit of the fun though.  The wait was on the long end of average, but not unreasonable. Everyone at our table managed to get our songs in before closing time, but just barely.  Other than coming home reeking of cigarettes, I had a really fun time here! I'll be back, as long as I'm coming with a good sized group of people.

What a great place. The guy who owns it is almost always at the front counter and is nice as can be- he even remembers my name when I come in. Everything I've ever taken there has been cleaned and pressed perfectly and any stains completely removed. The costs are totally reasonable and he is really flexible if you need something back quickly.   I wont take my clothes anywhere else!

One word: Raspados.  Oh. My. God.  Seriously, I didn't even know this place existed and now I'm already craving it again. This is simple food done absolutely right. Not loaded with extra ingredients, but each bite is bright, fresh and bursting with flavor. The guacamole was creamy but chunky and perfectly salted. The tacos were amazing... but what really made the meal was dessert- Raspados. Shave ice flavored with your choice of fruits (I had strawberry with pineapple) and then topped with a scoop of ice cream. I'm salivating as I type this.   What made it even better was the cook, who is the owner's mother, came out and visited with us for a few minutes. She was the nicest lady, and boy does she cook like a mofo.  Eat here for dinner tonight. You wont regret it.

Convenience wins you a lot of favor in my book. If I can get to a business by walking, biking or stopping on my way home from work or school, it gets big points.  On that note, Uno Stop is about as convenient as it gets for me. Trying to put that aside, I really like and appreciate this new business in the neighborhood. They took over a very large building and have a laundromat, convenience store and even serve some food.  I have yet to do my laundry there, but I have stopped often for Redbulls, packs of gum and a box of cereal and have been greeted with friendly service and reasonable prices.  What I like the most about this place is their teriyaki bowls. They serve a smattering of Japanese food, but their teriyaki bowls steal the show. I always get mine with tofu, but you can also opt for beef or chicken. I've heard good reviews on the meat versions from friends. You can also choose from sticky white rice and protein rice, both are extremely tasty. The best part (other than the delicious sauce) is that they are UNDER FOUR BUCKS. I mean, srsly? Where can you eat something relatively healthy for that much anymore?  The guys that run it are always super friendly, so if you're in the area by all means- give them a try. Plus, if you need a good laundry mat the whole place is brand new, so I have to imagine the washing machines are all probably pretty sweet.

I'm a recent tea convert coming over from the coffee dark side. I found this place on Groupon and I'm so glad I did. I came in, not sure what to expect and I left with not only 10 bags of amazing tea, but a huge retail-crush on Tea Time!  The employee, Rachel, was so knowledgeable and enthusiastic. When discussing different teas and blends, she would get so excited and you could tell she truly has a passion for what she does! I even thought she owned the place given how much she loved it all.  She assisted me in finding the kinds I knew I liked- coconut black tea, Chinese green, black chai... and even suggested some kinds I had never considered like roasted mate and vanilla rooibos.   They also had a nice selection of local treats like nuts, granola, olive oils, honey and jams. I picked up a bag of big, beautiful Arizona grown Pecans. Also, there's a decent selection of tea steeping accessories and teapots.   If you're a tea enthusiast or even just a beginner... check out Tea Time. They clearly have something for everyone!

Coffee is clearly the breakfast of champions.   The classy looking building caught my eye driving down Thomas Road (which I often do) and I was excited to try it out the following morning. I was greeted with friendly service and contemporary decor. The area was littered with young professionals tapping away on laptops using the free wifi service (which earns them a star on it's own, IMO).  My vanilla soy latte was priced only slightly above average cost, which I am happy to pay to support local business.  The taste was great- not too sweet and a good, strong flavor. Here's the kicker though... As an avid coffee aficionado, I don't often get a caffeine "buzz" but this latte had me WIRED. Please don't take this as a bad thing- I miss that feeling and boy did I get a lot accomplished that morning!   I'll be back, Echo Coffee!

I have a new favorite restaurant!  I had heard about this place because my sister had interviewed for a hostess position early this spring before the place had opened. She ended up taking another job, but she told me how beautiful the place was going to be and how health conscious and vegetarian/vegan friendly it was. I was excited to hear of a place like that finally opening in the East Valley. I love me some Green- but most of that place is vegan junk food and not so healthy (albeit delicious).  I had the Teriyaki burger, which was yummy and very flavorful. I spared myself the carbs and had it on the field greens, but I sort of wish I would have went with the bun after reading some reviews.  I even went with a very NON vegetarian, and he ended up really happy with his burger. Seems like this place has something for everyone.  I just had water, but the oogave sodas and all the drinks looked tasty. Maybe next time. Also on the agenda for next time is the deserts!  I'll be back for sure- it was great leaving from dinner and not feeling disgusting or suffering from gut-rot.

Matta's has a unique charm that keeps me coming back. I love that it's rich with history and has overcome so many obstacles to be serving food in Mesa again.   The service depends on who you get at your table, I've had amazing service and some pretty bad- but I always take it in stride. Nothing bad enough to keep me from coming back. As long as they keep the fresh chips and salsa coming, I'm happy.  Their dishes are simple Americanized Mexican food done right, complimented by inexpensive yet tasty margaritas. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and they employees seem genuinely happy to be there. You can sometimes even catch a live Mariachi band performing upstairs!  It's a solid choice for dinner at Mesa Riverview, and worth the drive from another part of town.

I swear I'm a kid in a candy store at this place. So many great brands, I've been known to kill a lot of time in this place. The location is awesome- Dana Park is probably my favorite shopping center in the East Valley.   It's really a one-stop shop for all things beauty. You can get your hair done, get your makeup done, get tons of great skincare and maybe even learn a thing or two from the helpful and knowledgeable staff.  This place also gives you an opportunity to support local small business when shopping for makeup, skin and hair care products instead of the big national chains!

I almost gave this place three stars based on the DJ playing pretty good tunes, but the fact that I will never go back based on my experience, the two star wins out. Because really, meh. I have experienced better. Much better.  My first experience was with a big group of girls for a friend's bachelorette party. We had gotten on the guest list, and were comped a round of drinks. We had a pretty good time despite how packed it was. Surely not my scene, but perfectly appropriate for a bachelorette party. It did not compel me to return, as I can pay significantly less than $12 for a vodka redbull elsewhere, minus the Jersey Shore cast lookalikes and with much less crowding. In hindsight, I think we would have had a good time no matter where we went, given the excitement of the group.  Flash forward to my little sister's 21st birthday party. This seemed like the perfect choice. I got in touch with the promoter and got on the guest list for power hour (midnight on her 21st birthday). When we arrived at midnight as arranged, the bouncer informed us that not only did the guest list close at 11:30, we weren't on in in the first place. I explained, and he let us in mostly because it was my sister's birthday, but half of our group was still trying to find parking. When they arrived, they weren't let in, even though we explained they were part of our party. Only having two hours for my sister to enjoy her evening, this cut into it significantly. Frustrated with our experience, we decided to pack up and head elsewhere.  One of the owners overheard us as we were about to walk out, and took us all back inside together. I was/am very grateful for that, but I am still bothered that it even came to that when I had prearranged our arrival days earlier. It took about half of our night dealing with that before we could really relax and enjoy ourselves, leaving us with an hour before closing time.  Combine that with surly servers, who look constantly annoyed- one of which literally SHOVED my boyfriend in a less crowded area away from the dance floor as she made her way back to the bar. I've worked as a cocktail waitress in a nightclub myself, so I get having to be assertive and move people out of the way when you need to, but this was a) excessive and b) unnecessary given how not crowded it was where we were standing. I'm sorry but there's plenty of places in Scottsdale that I could be overpaying for drinks, I don't need snobby servers mistreating me or my crowd just because we're not paying $300 for a $24 bottle of Grey Goose and a table.

Love this event! I mean, who doesn't love a cupcake- and who doesn't love a bunch of them? I ate more than I probably should have, but I'm pretty sure charity cupcakes don't have calories ;)  I love that 100% of the proceeds (not the profit- every penny!) goes to the charity. This year was a veterans charity as it was held on veterans day, which I think was fantastic and very appropriate.   The photobooth was hopping as always, and Brand-X made some awesome designs this year. I left with a "Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake" shirt.   Of course any large event isn't without it's hiccups, but remember folks- it's all for a good cause and everyone is working hard with the best of intentions. I had a blast and I'm already looking forward to next year!

Everything in this place is made in Arizona... how great is that?! I know exactly where I'll be shopping for my out of state relatives this coming Christmas.   The owner was very friendly and was eager to tell the story behind all the artwork and local goodies in the store. You could tell that opening this shop was a labor of love for the owners.   I hope they are busy and successful, because stores like this that support local artisans are only doing great things for our local economy!

While I know Vegas is known for it's incredible fancy restaurants, but a lot of times the mid priced food is not much more than sodium laden casino stodge. We were in the Cosmo late and found Secret Pizza. The line was long but it wasn't terrible. While part of me was expecting salty greasy cardboard I had high hopes because of the great reviews- and I wasn't disappointed! 4 stars instead of 5 because there isn't really much seating and the selection of pizza styles was pretty limited if you just want one piece vs an entire pie. While $6 is pretty steep for a slice, it's not bad for a meal in Vegas- especially one that is open so late!

Things I LOVE about the place:  The swanky, Eastern Indian inspired decor. The colors and textures are all very rich and it has a great lounge vibe.  Movie selection. Great films, and I love that it's all things that are too indie for Camelview. I'm looking forward to their selections of documentaries.  The owner. He came and visited with us, made small talk and discussed his vision for FilmBar. You could tell he is passionate about cinema, and is excited to bring this to Phoenix.  Things that were kind of a drag-  When I walked in, I felt a little unsure of what I was supposed to do. Do I sit at the bar? Walk around the back? If I sat down at a table would someone serve me or did I have to go to the bar? We eventually figured it out. Having a hostess on busy nights or someone greet you when you walk in would help the newbies feel welcome.  Having never been there, I didn't realize that 'appetizer' meant bag of chips. Which was fine, but I came hungry because I thought there would be actual food. This wasn't anyone's fault really, but in the future I'll definitely eat before coming.   The cackling chicks sitting one row back. The movie was fine minus your commentary. That can happen anywhere though.  Overall, this place is completely rad and having only been open like two months, they've surely got some kinks to work out. I was teetering between four and five stars, but in the interest of support and wanting this place to truly succeed, five stars it is.

Oh, Kitchen 56. Your retro charm, tasty noms and friendly service will definitely keep me coming back. Plus, who doesn't love a sparkling clean restaurant? I know I do.  I met friends for drinks and apps, and we all loved our food and left with some in boxes. The appetizers portion sizes really could be a meal in themselves. Our original plan was to meet at another nearby restaurant but there was no parking- Kitchen 56 definitely has parking to spare. A good amount by the front, then a HUGE lot on the other side of the street.  Drinks were on the spendy side, but we knew we were paying for nice atmosphere, tasty unique drinks like the Green Tea "Adult Lemonade" with mashed up strawberries and mint. SO GOOD.  Our waiter was attentive and very friendly, and the manager even came out and visited with us for awhile.   Overall, this is a great place to meet friends and be able to talk and not compete with loud music or a noisy street. Thumbs up!

I dropped in to have a watch sized. The gentleman at the front was fast to buzz me through the big iron security gate. He was very polite, and took the extra links out of my new watch quickly. It was only $6 and he did it while I waited- only took maybe 5 minutes. They were also really helpful when I had questions about having a more expensive watch serviced. I plan to bring a necklace and ring back here to be sized as well. Fast, polite and inexpensive!

WOW. I am sitting here with a full belly, absolutely impressed with the meal I just had. Fresh, flavorful and not too heavy. If I hadn't eaten like a million of the french fries, it would probably pass as healthy.  The owner was really nice and my to-go order was up quickly. It's right next to British Open Pub, so I can see a few post-drink meals happening in my future!   Oh, the hummus was AMAZING. When I saw it I expected it to be a little gritty and bland, but it was anything but. It has a great flavor but not too lemony or garlicy. Can't put my finger on exactly what is so awesome about it, but it is. Actually, even now as I'm as uncomfortably full as I am, I'm thinking about having another bite of it...

The word needs to get out about this place... for real. Better food than most of the expensive, trendy Scottsdale nosh stops and the prices seriously can't be beat. While it's hidden, the location is actually really convenient. It's right off Hayden and Roosevelt, which makes it an easy stop. Tons of parking and the strip mall is never crowded.   I've had the iced coffee, a simple english muffin with raspberry jam (which all tasted made from scratch, bee tee dubs) and a yogurt parfait. I've also tried the english muffin breakfast sandwich, which was to die for! The pesto aioli that everyone has mentioned is certainly worth the buzz. Everything I've had has been awesome.  I'm REALLY looking forward to trying the sandwiches for lunch... they oven roast their own turkey and chicken. I know I'm going to be eating there a LOT.

This place took my Pho virginity... and it was good.  I was initially excited when I sat down by the awesome playlist of old school hip hop playing in the background- it instantly put me in a good mood. The owner visited with us, and made some suggestions as this was my first time having Pho. I started with some spring rolls that they made to be vegetarian that tasted AMAZING. Perfect peanut sauce, and they replaced the meat with avocado and tofu. The taste hit the spot.   Next, I opted for veggie pho, which I was a little disappointed to find out that it was still a beef broth base, but I tried it anyway and it was delicious. They served it with a side of fresh bean sprouts, mint and a lime. So many different flavors, yet they all complimented one another.  I treated myself to a Thai iced tea, which honestly was one of the best I've ever had. Sweet, but without the smokey aftertaste that some Thai teas can have (which I hate- so I don't always order them). It came with some boba which was a fun addition.   I really hope this place does well, as the food, service and atmosphere were all great. I hear they are thinking about doing karaoke and I totally hope they do. I'll be back!

I think I may have discovered pizza nirvana.   I am a firm believer that a restaurant should pick something- and do it well. Il Bosco embodies this philosophy completely. The place is small and cozy, with a warm, rustic environment. The menu is simple with very few options- which I appreciate. It's even written by hand by an Italian calligrapher (then copied, but still!)   We were immediately served a small plate of olives upon being seated. I hate olives, but I appreciated the sentiment! I even worked up the nerve to try one, but it just confirmed that I do, in fact, still hate olives. The homemade bread and seasoned olive oil that followed was fantastic though.  My beverage of choice was sparkling water, which even that is made in house! It was served in a pretty glass bottle, tastefully etched with their logo. It was a little spendy at $4, but it was nice to have the bottle at the table to refill my cup as needed. The drink really was the only thing that was a little high priced, the pizza and appetizers were VERY reasonable- low even.  I opted for a plain cheese pizza with red sauce and basil. I had sort of high expectations after seeing that this place only had 5 star reviews, but even still I wasn't disappointed. I've had wood fired pizza at a number of places in Arizona, and this one really stands out to me. I think I could safely say that this is my favorite pizza in the valley. The crust is perfect. Not too fluffy, not too thin. Crispy parts, with doughy bubbles that are chewy in the center. The sauce was the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and I could taste a hint of red wine. The cheese was out of this world. I actually meant to ask the owner (who was waiting on us) about what made the cheese so fantastic. I will next time for sure.   They knew my dessert weakness, and had creme brulee with berries on the menu. I couldn't resist. I went against the owner's recommendation of the Lemon dessert, and I'm glad I did. The creme brulee was amazing, and each berry on top was ripe and sweet.  Seriously, I have no complaints about this place. It was a great date night dinner and I enjoyed my experience from start to finish. I can't wait to go back!

KISS- Keep It Simple, Stupid.  This applies to a lot of things- apparently food can definitely be one of those things. Just three things on the menu makes things uncomplicated- but you really can't go wrong. With the prices being so affordable, we tried all three, and were happy with everything. The topping bar made it easy to customize, and the service was fast and friendly.   So I'll state the obvious, yes- it's in the hood. Well, get over it. It's worth the drive into the cuts and nobody tried to mug us (even though we parked in the porno store parking lot).   My *only* wish would be for some chicken to go with that first rate beef for those of us who only eat beef on a rare occasion, but I can't really complain. They do what they do and they do it well. Thanks Tacos Sonora Grill!

If the tacos weren't so good, this event would have one star for sure.   The disorganization started from the moment we walked up. A long line (understandable) led to a group of tables running parralell to the line, and nobody to direct us where to go. "Just go pick a table and get tickets" someone said. Everyone was just crowded around these tables, and no one really knew who was next.   We bought tickets, and asked the girl at the counter if they would pay for the tequila samples. "um, I don't really know" she says. Okay, thanks for nothing. Especially in hindsight, I am pretty annoyed that I had to pay $10 for the privilege of walking in to a poorly run event, PLUS pay for my food. Especially when I'm sure all the vendors had to pay a pretty penny to participate.    Walking in, we get treated rudely by security AND have them questioning the authenticity of our ID's- which I mean, really? I'm almost 30. As much as I'd like to flatter myself, let's get real.   I did my best to shake it off to get ready to enjoy some tasty tacos. What I ended up (not) enjoying was lines 30+ people deep, nearly every booth being out of water and no shade to stand in.   I will say, the tacos that I DID get to try were very tasty, and the people running the booths were all very nice.  Unfortunately, the pros didn't outweigh the cons and I don't plan on returning next year.

It was with great excitement that I visited Pig & Pickle last Saturday. I went inside with wide eyes and the enthusiasm of a child on Christmas. Something so urban and hip in my little neighborhood of South Scottsdale! Yes, please and thanks in advance.  After dining, I am actually a little torn. There was stuff that was absolutely outstanding, and stuff that was just plain not good.  I'll start with the outstanding.  I personally don't really eat pork OR beef, but I figured when in Rome... I ordered the pot roast sammie, and seriously, I thought I was going to pass out from deliciousness. It tasted just like the amazing, tender pot roast that my mom used to make. It was topped with creamy cheese and caramelized onions. I'll be hard pressed to venture out and try anything new because this was just soooo good.  We also ordered desert after our meal, which if that is all I was reviewing this would be five stars without hesitation. The deserts were creative, delicious, not outrageously sized and are leaving me salivating just thinking about them.   The beer list was long, and the server was happy to offer recommendations. He was generally a friendly guy and explained the menu well when we had questions.  Now for the just plain not good....  Unfortunately, I have to mirror the sentiments of other reviewers and say that while very friendly, the service was poor. Wait times were long even though the place wasn't packed, and we sat with a table almost completely covered in empty dishes for most of our meal. We almost cleaned off our own table at one point just to have some room, but luckily our server eventually figured it out. I hate to say that because he was very nice, but they missed the mark on some basics of service.  The tots. I feel like I'm going to be mobbed for saying this, but to me- they weren't good at all. Maybe I was disappointed after assuming I'd get a traditional "tot", or maybe the tot of the day wasn't my fave, but I could only manage to eat half of one.  The tot was a "Philly Cheesesteak" and to me it was less tot and more fried mashed potato ball with peppers and steak. Not good, unfortunately. I will be totally open to trying them again in the hopes that the flavor of the day just didn't do it for me.  The cost wasn't outrageous but maybe a little high for the neighborhood. I didn't mind paying it, but some might balk at the prices.  Overall, I will be back, and am looking forward to it. I just know what I'll avoid this time. Hopefully they get their service in check and get their processes streamlined. I have faith in this place, and I hope it inspires other creative, indie eateries to spring up in South Scottsdale.

What is it about a good hair day that can change you from a grumpy introvert to beaming beacon of confidence and sass? I can't explain it, but I don't need to. I'm sure we've all experienced it.  You can walk into Primp and Blow in a two day old ponytail and walk out with a red-carpet ready, voluminous mane. I know- It happened to me!   When you first enter this dry bar, you are transported into a land of style and luxury. The decor is impeccable, and the retail is top notch. After my check in, I was introduced to my stylist Roman for a quick consult. I told him I like big volume, soft waves and I hate pomade- I have to be able to run my fingers through it! He said no problem at all, and took me back to the shampoo area.  That's where things got real.  I then had the best shampoo/scalp massage I have ever experienced, and I'm not even exaggerating. It was nothing short of heavenly. It must have lasted at least 10 minutes, and I'm pretty sure I dozed off.  Afterwards, he showed me some products he was going to use. He didn't go overboard at my request. They use Bumble and Bumble which is really top of the line stuff.   He styled my hair to perfection and I was super happy with the result. He listened to what I wanted and totally delivered. Not to mention being super fun to talk to.   One of the girls in the chair next to me had enviable cascades of beautiful blonde hair that looked breathtaking when she left. Roman was great, and it looks like the other stylists are awesome too.   I loved my hair- even the next day. I can't wait to go back!

Hot pink hummus? Now you're speaking my language. This place is like a delicious choose your own Mediterranean flavor adventure.   You can get a pita, salad or bowl and fix it up the way you want- sort of like Chipotle or Cafe Rio. Everything I tried was outstanding. I had two kinds of hummus- beet and cilantro. The star for me was beet. It was slightly sweet and so pretty on the plate- neon pink!  The chicken was tender and flavorful and the bowl had saffron rice which was also a delight. The tzatziki sauce had a slight spicy kick which I've never had, but ended up really enjoying as well.   The owner was working the counter and he was so nice. I really hope this place does well.   I'll be back for sure!!

Funny name. Serious workout.  I broke the seal. I sucked it up and faced the overwhelming intimidation... I finally tried crossfit. A friend recommended this place, and I am very glad she did. Everyone was warm and welcoming, eager to introduce themselves and show me the ropes.   The workout was amazing, and the instructor scaled everything to my skill level (which is moderate at best). I was woozy and light headed, but I am so excited to go back already. Plus, it's one of the best priced crossfit gyms in the valley. Can't beat that.  I'm hobbling around today with every muscle in my body on fire, and already looking forward to my next workout.

Three words: New. Favorite. Restaurant.  Not even kidding. From atmosphere, to service, to food, this place sets the standard. From what the owner told us, everything is made in house and sourced locally whenever possible. The taste and quality of our food reflected this.   We sampled something of each portion of the menu except the salads. We started with the bruschetta. It was phenomenal. Our entrees were a pepperoni pizza and the chicken over greens. They were both melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   Desert was an artistic take on a s'more- a brownie with Nutella, marshmallow fluff and gram crackers. Sweet but not overly so- the perfect finish to the meal.  The absolute stand out to me, however, was the drink I had. Even if the food was terrible (which it obviously wasn't) I would come back just for the drink. Try the Blueberry Basil Lime Tonic. You wont regret it. They also keep a number of wines on tap- which is extra cool. Wine's on tap make sure your glass is aerated by the time it gets to you, it also significantly reduces waste.  This is surely going to become a hot spot. I don't see how it wont. Come try it while it's new, so you can get in before the crowding gets out of hand!

After my trip to Puerto Rico, a tiny voice in my mind has been calling for empanadas relentlessly. Unfortunately some of the places I've been to here in AZ have been selling glorified hot pockets masquerading as empanadas, so you can imagine my delight finding a place that specializes in them.  It's tucked away in central mesa, and if you're not looking for it you'll probably miss it. The atmophere is fun, urban and inviting. We were greeted and seated promptly.  I ordered the chicken empanada with the black bean salad- both were absolutely incredible, especially when dipped in the delicious green salsa everyone gets as they're seated. Warning: the salad is a LOT of food- you might want to split it with someone or get ready for some leftovers. We also ordered desert which was nothing short of incredible. Spring for the scoop of ice cream and whipped cream- worth every penny of the extra $3.  My only complaint was that the service was incredibly slow, especially considering we were one of only three or four other groups in the dining room. All said it took us about an hour to get our food. Also, we were shorted one empanada that barely made it out before our desert- and when it did it was the wrong one and we waited even longer for the correction. We were still charged for that one, which I was a little surprised by. I didn't want to make a fuss, so we paid and didn't say anything.   That said, the service was very friendly and attentive, so no worries there. We'll definitely be back as soon as that little voice in the back of my mind nagging for empanadas starts getting too lout to ignore.

If Anthropologie opened a salon, it would look like Golden Rule! Adorable doesn't even cover it.   I see Sharisa once a month or so to tame my gray roots and trim my long hair. I always leave feeling gorgeous and she knows just how to cut it to make sure it grows out with minimal damage. Once in awhile we throw some ombré highlights in the ends, and they always turn out great.   They are an exclusive Bumble & Bumble salon, which is nice that they use such a high end product- only the best for my hairs :)  Don't miss this hidden gem in Mesa! I love it.

These cheese steaks are the things that dreams are made of. I work for a New Jersey based company and my dad is from Philly, so between work and family I spend a lot of time on the east coast- and have had my share of cheese steaks. If I had a Gino's, Pat's and USOC sandwich in front of me all at once, I'd go for United Steaks of Cheese every time. Not kidding.   The beef is really tender, and I've yet to get any gristle. Out of three sandwiches I've had there, I've opted for chicken twice (not normally a big beef fan) and those are also amazing. I will admit, there's something magical about a cheese steak with cheese wiz though. Yesterday I tried one of their special sandwiches- the Tsunami which was chicken, broccoli and yellow squash with teriyaki sauce and it was fantastic.   Everyone is always friendly, and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. My only wish was that they were a little more clear on their facebook or twitter on where they are in real time so I don't have to hunt them down so hard when the mood strikes. Dreaming of my next sandwich already :D

Finding a good dentist is no easy task. You often go to see them when you're at your most vulnerable and if they're not trust worthy they can really take advantage. So when you find one that is honest, kind, skilled and treats you with respect they are worth their weight in gold.  This is an small, unassuming office in North East Mesa, but I drove all the way from Tempe on a recommendation and I'm so glad I did. Dr Smith got me in quickly to see my painful abscess, made me feel at ease even though I need a root canal and all the while kept a good sense of humor about it. I really can't recommend them enough!!!
