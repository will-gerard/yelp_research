Food was not that good. the corn bread was amazing and the Tejas trio was very good,but the CHORIZO-STUFFED PORK TENDERLOIN was not that great and the price is expensive for just 3 pork tenderlions. I would not consider this place to anyone or go back every again

I went on there one year Anniversary and the food is very good. I would highly recommend there pizza or anything on the menu and the staff is very polite.
