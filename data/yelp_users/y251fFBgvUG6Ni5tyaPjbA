I USED to love them when they were a 1 location restaurant off of Glendale. Maybe they had more, but I felt is was very hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop, with great quality and care.  Tonight we ordered from the Bell Rd location. We asked for light sauce, and the pizza came without sauce. There was way too much spinach overload on the pizza, and mounds of garlic that made every bite taste just like, well, garlic.   Their breadsticks with mozzarella was the equivalent to poor man homemade breadsticks. Melt the cheese on a slice of bread.  Not impressed.

This place is terrible. They don't comply with operation hours and choose to close whenever they want. It's 7:30pm on Monday, and Yelp has listed they should be open until 8pm. We roll up and the building is pitch black.   What happened America's?! You used to be a really good spot. Now you've closed down locations and operate inconsistently.

I'll have to write about how amazing my facial was later!   PS - Don't wear perfume!

The best pancakes! Everything is delicious here. I'm ready to burst from this deliciousness. Don't think twice about going anywhere else!

Um, is this place not super cute or what? Obsessed with all things French, once I saw this new, local business I had to try! And tried I have, as twice I went on days they were closed (and I was so bummed!) But today was the lucky day!   First off, the interior is beautifully laid out and feels very much like a combination of a cafe and market from France. The co-owners were so nice, as I asked question after question about the business, excited it was my first visit.   Some amazing pros about the place:   -They make their own gelato in house - yum! -Some of the most delicious espresso I've tried around town, and it's not on fire when they serve it (my taste buds thank you). -AMAZING imported wine selection :) -Delicious looking pastries and nibbles (that I will have to try on my next visit!). -Most importantly, it's all things French!  Thank you French Grocery for creating this little gem in the neighborhood! I will definitely be frequenting your business!

Don't waste your time and money. Not only is the food cold and greasy, but also disgusting.   Who 'fixes' cold food by throwing it in the deep fryer for a second time? Cook up a new plate instead.

So far I'm loving it!  I lived in SF for a couple of years, and they make damn good coffee over there. So whenever I see a local joint carrying an SF roast, I get so excited. (Brewing Ritual coffee for ya.)  Great location - as in this area needed something delicious! I hate Starbucks and Dutch Bros, and that seems to dominate the north Scottsdale area. Plus, it's on my drive to work, so I'll definitely be stopping by often on my morning commute.  Friendly staff with great smiles, love the ambience, and in an area of town that desperately needed it.
