Wow, what an amazing spot.  I'm not even usually a fan of "gardens" as an attraction, and granted, there's not much adrenaline to be had here, but they do the gardens thing really well, as well as a ton of cool events throughout the year.  You walk in across a bridge, see your first plants, your first chihuly cactus, then up to the front to pay admission. Once inside, you have a couple different paths you can take, a couple of gift shops, and a classy restaurant. The whole thing feels really well done, modern and sophisticated, and it gives you a great feel for desert landscaping.  If you can hit up a night activity there, do it.

Made a reservation a month in advance for 7, noting that it was an anniversary dinner (and hoping for one of the curtained off couples tables.) Called the night of and asked if we could change the reservation to 7:30 since we were running late.  We were informed that we could not and that we needed to make it within 15 min of our original reservation in order to be seated.  We rushed and made it right at the "cutoff" mark, and were seated at a huge table, I assumed because all the couples tables were full.  After getting settled in, we looked around only to find the restaurant dead empty.  We were one of maybe 5 parties there.  Why the rush?  Would have given only one star if not for the great food, and having plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  The server was quite attentive, so I think it's just the hostess desk that's not up to par.  Note; this will be a long meal so plan accordingly.  You can't do this place quick, its an experience.

Great food and a family atmosphere makes this a great place to watch a game on the weekends. Love this place!

Super packed between the hours of 6AM-9AM, 11AM-1PM, 2:30pm-close.  It used to be you could show up early afternoon and get to the machines you want.  They REALLY need to expand - they have basically just never quit taking new signups regardless of how full they are.  Now your workout routine is forced to be "whatever is open this minute".  They also have poor allocation of the space they do have.  Some areas and machines are super popular and you can never get a spot, like free-weights or pec deck, whereas the racquet sports or spinning room rarely have a visitor.

We come here for frufru drinks like 50cent Starbucks refreshers  and cheap clif/zone bars.  Some of the stuff they sell is junk so tread carefully.  Never more than 1 cashier.   Still stop by twice a month at least.

Bought the half-price groupon for this place.  Except their prices are nearly double a normal store price.  Not really a deal, and poor selection.

Came here to study - because of the music, this place was louder than Saturday night bar even though it was early afternoon on a weekday. It is also full of out-of-work hipsters. Headed for a more coffee-shop like coffee shop.

First table they gave us was in front of the band.  Why have a band blasting at like 7PM on a friday night?  No one goes here to dance, they come here for dinner.  We are a young couple and like music, but it was so loud we couldn't converse.  Totally inappropriate for the atmosphere. We told the waiter we were leaving.  Instead, he said he could get us a quiet table.  He found us a spot in the marketplace, which although it felt like a closet, it was at least a calm closet.  We had glasses of wine (reasonably priced), I had a kale salad which was amazing (first time ive liked kale to be honest), and my gf had some kind of fish dish.  Good food!  Like it.  Ditch the band.

Second large group experience here.  Out with a party of 10 at 8pm Saturday night looking for dinner and drinks.  After being told it would be a long wait at R&R, we walked to Saddle Ranch.  They said 30 minutes to get us a table for 10... but volunteered that since we had a wait, they would set us up at the bar and the first round is on the house. (!!!)  The wait was probably a little longer than 30 minutes, but the bartender made great drinks, food and prices were good, and our server brought us a round of after-dinner shots, again, on the house.    I was especially pleased because this is the second time I've come with a large group on the weekend and we were treated really well at Saddle Ranch - that is why I direct all my large groups here.  Cheers to the manager for taking care of us and earning our loyalty.   EDIT:  If you're out on a weekend night looking for a good value for a drink, the AMF is the house specialty.  $13 for a carafe (guessing 32 ounces) of a coconut-flavored long island.  If you ride the bull as a guy, the operator tries to throw you as quickly as possible.  For girls, however, they go pretty easy on you.

Good: You can bring your own drinks, the bus ride is pretty crazy, and it is a novelty for sure - great if you're getting bored of the standard "night out".  Bad: 1. The bus is really really hot.  2. Our group chartered the bus, but it broke down several miles from our cars. After sitting there for about an hour they announced we weren't going anywhere.  So they gave us back our bus fare and that was that.  The result:  Our group got on our cell phones and ordered a mess of taxis, which we paid for ourselves.  We went back to Scottsdale - we still had a good time, and we enjoyed the bus while it was working.  But we weren't happy with just being left to fend for ourselves and having to pay our own way back to our cars.

Favorite downtown lunch spot.  I'm not sure it will stay that way when it gets too hot to eat on the patio, but the parking is easy (garage in the back), prices for lunch reasonable ($8-11 for salad and sandwich) and the food is awesome.  I had the maximus burger (burger stuffed with risotto) on the house bread with spinach salad.  Risotto inside the burger was a little out there, but I ordered because it was different.  Maybe one of the better burgers I've had.  Definitely coming back.

Not reviewing the food or atmosphere, just the management at CPH:  Went with a large group of 40 or so people - given the private room upstairs.  Due to what was apparently a miscommunication, CPH only wanted to allow our party to order from a set menu.  Many of us were not interested the set 4-course meal, and wanted food/drinks from the regular menu.  The management was not willing to allow this - since we didn't order from the fixed menu, they charged our group a $500 surcharge.   So, CPH got $500 from our group (instead of the much larger fare had they allowed us to order from the normal menu.    But that will be the LAST penny CPH will ever see from me.    Saddle House, on the other hand, took great care of our large group at a moments notice.  We ate and had drinks there all night, including some freebies thrown in because they appreciated our business.

Groupon find. Had their specialty pizza - fig and jalapeno, add chicken.  Delicious pizza, got the large, and it lasted 2 people for 3 meals.  Friendly staff and fresh ingredients!

Tried to go here at 10pm on Saturday night the night before the Super Bowl. Cityscape was literally so packed you could barely walk for blocks in every direction. Downtown was literally the busiest district in America that night, almost Times Square on NYE level. Full of tons of hungry people with few food options. Chipotle has a line inside, and a mob of people standing outside. I go up to the door to pull it open --- Locked. Are you kidding me? You are sitting on the most desirable piece of real estate for a business in the whole US tonight, with literal mobs banging on the door to give you money, so you shut it down and go home?

Smooth Moves is an awesome moving company that I have recommended to many friends.  They are on time, they have a great work ethic, and the price is right.  Give them a try, you won't regret it.

Came in the middle of the day to do a routine screening for a new job. When I showed up, there was just one other person in the waiting room. 30 minutes later sitting in the waiting room, the person before me is still here, and I still haven't been allowed to go in to pee in the cup. What does it take to hand over the cup and stick the label on it?   Oh, and she tells me that if I leave, it's an automatic fail. How many hours will I be here waiting? Also overheard receptionist being rude to a customer on the phone as I walked up...   Finally got called back there.  No other patients were in the back of the clinic, so I don't know what the hold up was, and there were a couple of techs milling around. The lady that actually handed me the cup to pee in was nice though.

Grouponed here, great dessert and good service.  You will find the decor and seating a little basic, and the prices a little high.  However, they use high-quality ingredients, healthy stuff, and serve huge portions so it's not really that pricey from that perspective.  Check out their menu online first, since they have a lot of options.

Fan. Tas. Tic. bbq.  The guy that runs this place is pretty well known on the national BBQ circuit, and is known as a great competitor and a great guy. The pulled pork, brisket, pastrami, and pork ribs are all fantastic. The hours are very limited though, it is open roughly 20 hours a week. If I had one rub its that this place is still keeping lines deliberately very long when it doesn't have to be that way.  Good way to build anticipation and a name before anyone knows about you, but now Lil Miss has a following, they don't really need to do that.

Upscale atmosphere, fancy clothes, professional bartenders and true mixology, classy place... am I really in CenPho?  Maybe the district is growing up.   We went in and found a long and detailed menu, complete with graphs depicting where each drink lands on a scale so you can decide how adventurous you want to be.  But we didn't even use it, the bartender just asked us what flavors and liquors we liked, and he made something custom for us.  We also got the dessert in a cup, and it was amazing.  The bill did come to like $80 for 2 drinks each for 2 people, and 1 dessert.  So prepare yourself.  Also you likely need "reservations" to get in, since this place is busy.  I guess we looked the part since they just let us in anyhow, so maybe that is "flexible".  Yelp Review of the Day on the menu board is a nice and hilarious touch.

Our table came here for the second time, for dinner on a Saturday night with a groupon. The waitress was pleasant and had lots of tips for us, the beer selection is varied and changes all the time, and the non-beer options are even really good.  The first time I came here I got the steak burger also, and since it was so good, I got it again. Ordered medium, it came out somewhere between medium and medium rare, very juicy and very flavorful. I'm not a fan of carbs so I did bunless, which they were able to successfully pull off.  The bacon jam is amazing, and really makes the burger.  We got a total of 3 steak burgers and 1 normal burger as well as salmon.  All options were really great.  Salad comes with an amazing basil dressing, I dumped it all on the salad and didn't regret a thing.  We also had some truffle fries, and they are pretty dang good too.  My mother didn't like them because she doesn't like flavors, but the rest of us thought the truffle and Parmesan were great touches.  If I had one complaint, $15 for a burger and fries is probably too spendy, even if it is good food. This place isn't going to shake the fact it is a brewpub.  They leave all the doors and windows and garage doors and whatever else open, so it's pretty freezing in there at night, bring a coat in the winter.

I hear this place is closing soon - sad to say that is probably true.  This building has been a revolving door for tenants, because it is so far off the beaten path.    The good - lots of free games, $1 shot-bingo, fair drink prices, very chill and relaxed atmosphere.  Even on a Saturday night.  Which is probably why it's closing.  But hey, parking is always easy!  The bad - arcade machines will steal you blind of quarters, you have to hunt a bartender to get a drink, and it is closing.  Overall super fun place my friends and I hit up at least 10 times while we could.

Wow. This place was a trip.  Guy in front of me got frustrated that they couldn't follow his simple directions for what he wanted and left. Lady next to me asked if they could put hot BBQ on hers, they said they can't do that. Guy after me came up to complain that they had slathered his order in hot BBQ even though he asked for mild (I thought they can't put hot on anyone's? Apparently you can only get hot if you DONT want it). They put hot BBQ all over mine, even though I didn't ask for hot. Luckily i like spice! Another guy in line left because they were taking too long.  They were out of ribs and so they just made  me a plate without the ribs I ordered and tried to give it to me like that. Cashier had to send it back to get another type of meat in place of ribs.   After that comedy of errors I half expected to find a hoof in my meat, but actually overall the meat was excellent, though the workers are not on the ball at all. Very poorly run restaurant, but surprisingly good food.
