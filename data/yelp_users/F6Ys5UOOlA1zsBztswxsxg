Service was competent, polite and accommodating. Short ribs were good, though not perfect (but I am admittedly picky about braised meats). Shoestring fries - a substitution provided without complaint - are not my favorite style, but here they were hot, crispy and delicious.  And to top it all a good local beer selection.

A/C stopped working so I took it in; I don't usually use Sun Devil but they were convenient and I've had a fair enough experience in the past.  They said I needed a new compressor and clutch for just under $900.  I took it to my regular mechanic who said I needed a $5 bolt.  That's class.

I joined on a month-to-month plan in July, 2012.  The gym is pretty good, no real complaints about the facility or staff.  In September, they hit me with a $25 "enhancement fee" out of the blue.  The claim from corporate billing was that this is in the contract.  I don't remember anything about it, and I'm completely sure it was never pointed out by the guy that signed me up.  So, they get $25 and lose the $40 a month I was paying for membership.  Good for them.  I don't do business that way, and I won't do business with anyone who does if I can help it.

I'll have to add my one-star in with the others that could not detect a "bar" in this location.  It's a house in a neighborhood, and nothing about it says public.  We even knocked at the door at 6PM for a few minutes and got no response.  That combined with the fact that there is no "Kitchen Bar" in Google maps nor is there a phone number published anywhere makes it hard to believe the place exists.

Delicious food at a very reasonable price.  I had the Paneer Jalfrezi - a dish with which I was previously unfamiliar.  It was rich, flavorful and perfectly seasoned.  The chai was also lovely.

Brilliant BBQ, which though the situation is improving is still not easy to find in the valley.  The brisket was moist without being fatty and very flavorful.  The sauces were good, though the quality of the meat made them non-essential.  The mac and cheese (a must-have for any good BBQ, if you ask me) was quite rich and tasty.  Finally, the staff were all very friendly and helpful.

I ordered takeout yesterday for dinner so I won't discuss atmosphere, alcohol or service; I'll update my review when we hit this place for happy hour, which after last night we definitely plan to do.  The food alone deserves four stars.  I had possibly the best meatloaf I've ever had and my dining companion had mac and cheese that was rich and flavorful, even after sitting for the trip home.

This place is wild.  Getting inside can be challenging, as the only entrance is in the back, in a dingy alleyway.  You'll know you've finally found the right door when you see the tiny neon sign over it and (probably) the bouncer out front.  Then up the industrial-looking stairs, a left turn and suddenly you're in this super-cool bar.  The AZ-themed cocktails are all well-crafted and interesting; some classics, some original.  The food menu, by Short Leash Hot Dogs, is as good as expected.  And the interior of the place has no end of things to look at.
