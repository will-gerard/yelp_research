Had a great customer service experience tonight. I was looking for a specific refrigerator and the Surprise location didn't have it in stock. Bud, went out of his way to provide excellent customer service. He checked for availability in nearby locations, then called to see if they could have it delivered to us. He helped us with a phone order, so we didn't even have to go into the other location. I believe he may normally work in the paint department. The phone order transaction was super easy. Thank you Lowe's for hiring great employees and making our day a little easier!

Highly recommend this little cruise! Canyon Lake is absolutely stunning and this was a great way to see it. On this trip, we didn't get to see a lot of wildlife, but I would still go again. The crew was very friendly and accommodating. There was a Groupon available also at the time, which made it even better. We ate at Mining Camp Restaurant before the cruise. The restaurant was also great. We checked out the ghost town after the cruise. The ice cream there cooled us off a bit and the homemade waffle cones were great.

We were in Scottsdale for another happening and wanted to try this place out. I had seen that Guy from Diners, Drive Ins and Dives had been there. My husband had the same homemade sausage with peppers sandwich that Guy had. He added provolone cheese to it. The pricing on that sandwich was very affordable! I ordered the Purista and it was fantastic. We shared an order of red potato salad. I would def go back again!

I usually love Kohl's. I was not impressed with my experience today. As I walked in, the sales associate didn't have anyone at the register but I wasn't greeted either.   I went into the store knowing what I was looking for. This store was set up opposite from what I'm used to. I went to the girls section to look for jeans. I couldn't believe the mess the folded jeans were in. It looked like Black Friday x 10. I had a hard time finding my daughters size because they were all unfolded and stacked on top of each other.   After finally finding the correct size, I proceeded to check out. There was a line of people by this point, so backup was called. Apparently the backup cashier was new or wasn't the cashier very often. The gal in front of me had an issue with getting a $10 off code to work. The cashier finally got it to work after asking the other associate for assistance. I had a rewards coupon on my phone. Generally I just show them the phone & they scan it. This guy took my phone from me & tried to scan it on the bottom scanner. When he realized that didn't work, he proceeded to use the gun. I also had another coupon and he took my phone from me again. I was very ready to get out of the store. I'm not sure if it's a management issue, understaffing or both. With the other Kohl's stores not to far away, I'm not sure I'll be returning to this one.

We came here because it was my Son's choice for his birthday. If it wouldn't have been for his birthday, we would have left, even though it's a hour + drive from our home. As others have mentioned, the service is very slow. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though there was no one in front of us. Once seated, we had to wait a while before our waitress came. By the time she came, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we went ahead and gave it to her. The group sitting next to us got their food before us. About 10-15 minutes after that we asked the manager. After he checked on the order, he informed us that our waitress had not put in our order. He then offered us 50% off our meal, and put our order in. We got our food fairly quick after that. I was hoping to be offered something small prior to our food, but no such luck. Everyone was pleased with the food. My club was just an average club though. When we got our check, they charged us for an adult size soda with the kids meal. It was supposed to include a drink. It was also my son's birthday, so we informed them. They came over and sang and gave him a cupcake. They then charged us for the cupcake also. Oh well, at least we got it for 50% off!

If you haven't downloaded their mobile app, do it now. I got a free big chicken fillet sandwich. It was the first time I had tried their chicken sandwich. I also ordered fries and went through the drive thru. I ate the fries right away. They were just warm, so not all that great. I ate the chicken sandwich when I got home. It was still warm, so I'm assuming hot when I first got it. The chicken fillet sandwich was one of the best I've had from a fast food restaurant. I took off the top part of the bun, because it was way to much bread for me. Fresh lettuce and tomato was on it, with a very small amount of mayo. Just how I like it. I would have given a 5 if it wasn't for the fries.

The best ice cream around. Such a neat little convenient store. They have sandwiches, hot dogs and even pizza. We've never tried anything but the ice cream. We go back for it every time though. My parents always stop in for some ice cream when they are in town also!

Adding to my post from before. We've also had their hot dogs, cheese bread & pizza. The hot dogs are large and the order of cheese bread is also large. Both taste great and a great value. We've now ate there several times. We were just there again today. All the Ladies working were super nice!

My Mom and I both got our first pair of cowboy boots here. It was our first time in the store. There was a great selection to choose from. Bobbie assisted us in fitting us for our new boots. She was great! I will definitely be back again. They have some cute western wear also.

I love the White Tanks! So many great trails and many more that I haven't checked out. If you don't have an annual pass, it's $6 to enter.   Great for hikers, runners, bikers, horseback riding and more!

My favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is always good and we're always greeted with a smile.   I always order Sesame Chicken, my husband gets the Beef with Broccoli and my daughter gets the kids Sweet in Sour Chicken. Their lettuce wraps and egg rolls are always good too!

Food is good, but service was excellent. It's hard to find good service. Ask for Tamara!

I've been to this location many times. I had a great experience with customer service tonight, at this location. I bought 3 bar stools online. I put together one of them and it was too tall for my bar. I brought all 3 into the store and they returned them with no problem. I ended up spending another $50+ while I was there. This makes the 2nd time I've had a great customer service experience with Kohl's in general. Definitely one of my fave retail stores.

Very happy with my recent stop there. Roadside assistance came out and changed my tire, and put my spare on. I dropped my tire off, that had a nail in it. The store was very busy, but they had a lot of people working. It was on a Saturday, after Christmas, so, it was expected. When I came back to pick it up, they even asked me if I would like them to put it on. They put it on for me, then told me I was all set. When I told them I hadn't paid for it yet, they told me repairs were free. Score!! I will definitely be back, for my tire needs.

This was our first visit here. They are busy on Friday nights!   Prices were good and the portions are large. I had the Philly Steak & Cheese.   The food arrived fast and the service was great. There was a man who was walking around checking on all the tables. I'm thinking he may have been the owner.   All the food was served very hot, which is great. A very good experience! We'll be back!

What a neat little place. Sandwiches, salads, desserts, and breakfast items. I had the ham on marbled rye and my husband had ham on sourdough. My kids had bacon, eggs and sourdough toast. We would visit again if we were in the area and needing lunch.

This is the spot we hit before the Rattler's games. We've been here 3 times now. There are two Men that are always there. I'm assuming they are the owners or managers. They are always very friendly and making sure everyone has what they need. I've tried something different every time and it has always been good. The serving sizes are pretty large too. Great place!

Checked this place out for the first time yesterday. I ordered the pulled pork with cheesy potatoes and my husband ordered the brisket sandwich- lean with cheesy potatoes. You can have onions and pickles put on your sandwich. Since I had never tried either on a BBQ sandwich, I tried both.   The gentleman who was cutting the meat was very friendly. I'm guessing maybe he was the owner? He even brought us out a sample of the ribs, which were delicious. We ended up ordering a half rack to take home.   We will definitely be back again. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, but my husband said the brisket was a little dry. I also liked the cheesy potatoes, but they were just ok to him. Next time he said that he will order the ribs.   I just wish there were a few more options on the menu, like maybe hot dogs and fries for the kiddos.
