This is my favorite frys!!! I go out of my way just to go to this location.  Today I was coming out of the store and a candle I just bought fell out of my cart as I was leaving the store. Tyler noticed and said I'm so sorry that your bag ripped and literally ran and brought a new one to my car. Good people still do exist! Keep it up frys!

#1 for service!!! Used Chad and his crew for every event I have! Always on time, friendly and make sure things are spotless before they leave. Staff is wonderful about communicating and making sure my event is handled from start to finish. If you have a wedding or event look no further!

Super disappointed!  I love zipps and frequent the other locations quite often, gave it a shot on a saturday afternoon, sat at the bar, and literally waited 20 mins before i was even noticed. (Not exaggerating) ordered a zipparita with chambord, delicious,  always are, then asked for a menu and got a sigh like i was a bother to her by asking for a menu, (brunette with a hat) ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheese, and when it arrived, there was no buffalo sauce at all, (they are supposed to be tossed in it) or blue cheese as it comes with on the menu, at this point i flag down my server, and ask for buffalo sauce and once again i felt as though i was bothering her by asking her for items that i ordered and never received.  The bill comes, my margarita was charged full price.  They were on special saturday before 4.. and was charged for extra sauces.. and it was supposed to come with my order hence the name buffalo shrimp. How can you charge extra for something that is part of the order? Very disappointed.  A call to weights and measures will be made. We wont be back to this location.
