Food was alright. Service was the worst I have ever experienced. I took almost two hours for us to receive our food. I haven't and will not go back. THAI HUT IS MUCH BETTER/CHEAPER/BETTER SERVICE!!

Everything here was delicious and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Service was incredible as well... I just feel its overpriced for what you receive

Great location. Usually amazing shows. However I don't usually come down here unless there is someone or a band specifically I enjoy playing here. Great local bands are always here though and the art is always enjoyable.

Ive been to this place only twice but both times Ive sat outside cause the inside can get too cramped sometimes. However, dont let that push you away. The food is excellent and the service is quite nice. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the nice settings it brings. 4 out of 5 for the wait sometimes.

Excellent place for food. I've only been here twice but the food is so tasty. I really love the atmosphere of it, especially on a Saturday or Sunday brunch time. 4 out of 5 simply because they're NEVER OPEN!

This place is like the equivalent of The Clubhouse, in Tempe, but in Phoenix. The layout makes no sense, and the character of the building is incredibly, old and out dated. Especially with as many good acts and money they bring in, its time to reinvest your money to renovate/improve. They pull in great acts but almost always the venue pushes me away from seeing them. Not worth it.

I absolutely adore this place. Coming here makes me feel like I am in a real city. I love being able to buy all those rare drinks, waters, wines and little trinkets. The restaurant is just as amazing as well and the customer service is always above and beyond.

Since the last time I was there: NO AC, the one avail toilet was broken and backed up creating a foul odor across the venue. Not to mention the hundreds of sweaty 13 year olds hanging out making a mockery of themselves instead of allowing others to enjoy the only pleasurable experience from this place... the music.

TRASH. TRASH. TRASH. This bar is a complete waste of time. The only time I will go there now is if a friend is playing there. Every time I have gone it is like our generations excuse to be completely uninhibited, disgusting and irresponsible. Not to mention if you want a free show of someone blowing someone else, screwing, fighting or snorting things this is THE place to be.

Every time I go to this place I ask myself what I am doing there. I rarely find anything there that is a good buy and the staff is completely ridiculous.  They usually talk down to me and they aren't very helpful at all. Even more so when I try to sell very good items to them I get very little back. Not worth it.

This place never ceases to amazes me. I've been here multiple times and even had a birthday dinner there. The service is, at times, questionable. One day they're on point, others they're not. The food makes it alllllll worth it. LOVE THE HOMEMADE GUAC!

This place is really ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it seems to be growing too big for itself. Every time I go inside there now I have to wait in a line for my drink and then there is never any seating unless you go outside. The staff is usually pretty cool depending on who you get. I love the design and layout. Great tea and coffee. Wireless internet as well!

Not bad at all. The staff is always very nice and quick. The sandwiches are alright, usually just a little soggy since they are not made right on the spot. THE CUPCAKES are incredible and so is the dill potato salad. Everything is pretty expensive but its usually worth it.

Completely pathetic restaurant. I was with Derrick when I went, so reference his story. I would never come here again. I wish places like this were banned from being in downtown.

Wonderful food. I love that I have multiple options of beverages and snacks/entrees and all of them have been above what I wouldve expected. I love being able to wake up and walk down from my apartment for a treat. GREAT SERVICE TOO! I just wish the size of the venue was larger for more order organization.

Love the interior design, very intimate and new york, midcentury modern appeal. I love the idea of the bar, but most of the time its so crowded its hard to enjoy.

The new location is awesome and I love how they place the DJs they have upstairs overlooking the front of the store. The staff is always friendly and inviting and most of the clothes are great. I always make time to stop here when I am Biltmore.

Awesome vintage stuff. I don't usually buy the brand new dresses or things like that there. I usually go in the back for the second hand items. Every single time I go in there I find something right up my alley. The few couples times I had gone in there the staff was a little unfriendly and sort of snobbish. However, now when I go in they're a lot more nice and caring. The style of this place is beautiful and I love the layout. 4 out of 5 for inconsistent mood and crazy prices sometimes.

There is absolutely nothing terrible I can say about this place. I am so grateful we actually have a public market. I am on roosevelt row and love being able to walk/ride over.  All vendors sell very quality based produce/products and are wonderful to talk to. Ive bought Alaskan sockeye salmon twice from the same farm family and it's the best and most fresh salmon Ive cooked. I will forever be a visitor and only hope to see vast growth in the future.

I have never had an unpleasant experience here. Ive sat in multiple areas of the restaurant.... the upstairs being my favorite. I love the dim lighting and contrast in soft/rough architecture. Incredible seasonal food. WONDERFUL service. I once stayed pass closing time without realizing it and I was never rushed or given attitude nor was it brought to my attention by the staff. Thank you St Francis. You were above my expectations.

This place is pretty neat. However, after they moved locations in Biltmore Fashion I am a little disappointed in what they are trying to display. Their stuff has always been very expensive but it was more substance to a lot of their items. Where now you can buy a 20 page book for 50 dollars if you are lucky. Pretty unrealistic. But it takes money to make your condo look incredible. The staff is like a pregnant woman. Depends on what day you are in and what face you are dealing with. Ty that works there is a friend of mine but I always see being awesome to everyone that walks in.

I was completely not into this whole toy thing before until my boyfriend had taken me to this store when it had opened. When I got there all I wanted to do was buy everything. Which, I have pretty much have tried to do. Every time I go there I get something new. Not only is the place completely diverse in what it has but the staff is always really amazing and down to earth. I give 4 out of 5 simply because the womens clothes do not have a huge selection. Usually I am more inclined to buy the mens clothes. But still this place is awesome!

Ive gone to WayCool for years now for mulitple reasons whether its a getting my hair done for a photoshoot or for my own personal cut.   CHRIS always cuts my hair beautifully. Last time I went in, I didnt have a precise idea what I was going to do with my long red locks. My hair was so long,  I had to make a change, and cut at least 7 inches off. I was so worried because of past experiences Ive had with other salons. Chris saved the day not only getting me to cut all the 7 inches, which I knew I had to but definitely didnt want, and combined my style with what would actually work with my face shape. Everyone loved it just as much as I did. Even when he styles my hair for photoshoots, his creativity never ceases to amaze me. Along with Darci as well.... Ive only worked with her once for a shoot but she did a wonderful job.  Needless to say, everyone at WayCool know exactly what theyre doing with this great alternative feel that Phoenix doesnt have in salons anywhere.  OH! AND THANK YOU FOR GOING BUMBLE&BUMBLE on us. BEST DECISION YOU GUYS MADE!

Absolutely incredible flavors. Service and environment is wonderful and had no issues whatsoever. I am eternally grateful for a restaurant like this. There is not nearly enough island flavor in the city and I feel The Breadfruit certainly represents it. Thank you!

I will do anything or use any excuse not to go to this place. I hate dealing with all the people here and the staff. If I wanted to be judged, I would rather go to church.

Great culture infused food. LARGE selection of different tapas and they've all pleased my pallet when no other asian tapas restaurant has. I love the cocktails served and the service is always above par.

Really quality vintage clothing. I have so much of my wardrobe from this boutique. Great styles, good prices and you cant leave this place without wanting to buy a trunk filled with goods. Honestly, one of the top 3 vintage shops in town. Service is awesome, per usual. Traci and Jasmine are always willing to offer any help and throw the best community events for their shop. A+++

This place is one of the very few that I get excited to be in. Not sure why, maybe its the whole hotel restaurant entrance thing or just the interior decor. It sets an atmosphere foreign to Arizona for me. The food more than backs up its reputation. Along with their signature cocktails. I will always be a frequent customer of this restaurant. I am glad Clarendon could finally settle whatever legal/professional issues they had to have a great restaurant for years to come.

I would never recommend living in this apartment place. I've lived in several wonderful apartments throughout downtown Phoenix and Tempe, but never have I experienced such a terrible living situation as I have at Mill Pointe Aparments. Here are the reasons why:  1. constant crime area: gunshots, homeless walk freely through the property grounds, strangers/possible harmful individuals knocking on your door pretending to be servicemen, police constantly driving through but never actually doing anything, etc. when coming home at night time, ive noticed plenty of clearly ODD people sneaking around the parking lot, looking through cars. in one instance i saw a man that lived in an apartment at mill pointe chasing after a man with a mask, claiming he was looking through the windows of his home watching his family.  2. mgmt company: every time i have called them for a work order, or alterations to my lease, or any kind of question, the manager of the complex is ALWAYS "out in a meeting" and/or unavailable. no matter when i call, morning noon or evening. after becoming upset about this recurring problem, i called and once again they told me jennifer the manager was in a meeting, so i walked down to the offices, and there was jennifer in her office, alone with the door shut. (i could see since her since her office has a window) I have also called on many occasions during business hours for work orders and no one ever answered the phone for a few hours.  3. the apartments: had a bug issue upon moving in. flies and gnats everywhere. my neighbor had told me upon her moving in, her refrigerator was infested with dead cockroaches. the apartment was not cleaned (mold ring in the toilet) and numerous inconsistencies within the infrastructure, such as holes to nowhere under the sink and in certain areas of the floor boards when they connect to a wall or cabinet.  4. work orders or issues with living conditions: water was shut off for multiple days without warning or notice. i, nor did most of my connecting neighbors, have hot water for over 48 hours, MULTIPLE TIMES. I called one sunday because my front door would no longer lock (the door was splitting in half) the serviceman complained about having to leave his home on a sunday to fix my broken front door. he didnt fix anything but tighten the screws of the deadlock. i explained to him ive done this numerous times but the door continues to loose grip of the lock since it is splitting down the middle, he refused it was an issue with the door and refused my request to replace the door altogether, rendering the safety of my apartment completely unimportant.  All other complaints I have about this apartment complex is minuscule compared to the ones listed above.  STAY AWAY.

Great second hand furniture and housewares. The clothes are amazing too I just wish they had more of them. The lady working was so very kind and knew a lot about the local stuff going on. If you are looking for a good find for reasonable prices definitely come to this place.
