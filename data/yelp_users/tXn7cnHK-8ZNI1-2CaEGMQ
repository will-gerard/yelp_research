Love the food and iced coffee, but it's so hard to park here. So it's always to-go orders for me.

Went through the drive though and I ordered a Mexican Pizza with sour cream, and a Dorito's Loco Taco. Received a Mexican Pizza with no sour cream, and a regular taco. The customer service was so/so. I wrote corporate and complained because this was about the millionth time they have screwed up a order when I was the only car in the drive through, and they sent me a coupon, for two items of my choice, and the GM called me and said I could come in and she would replace my food. Glad they fixed the problem, but I really am starting to believe their employees just go through the motions of their minimum wage pay, and could care less if they screw up or not. Seems to be the trend at most fast food places now a days.

There food is great of course, but I wanted to leave kudos for our server Blake! He was supper funny, and when I asked for a Sierra Nevada, and he accidentally brought me a Sierra Mist he made up for it by offering the next one for free and just had a great attitude. I hope his management team recognizes his potential and awesome customer service.

I wanted to go to Oreganos but my bf suggested we go here instead. Place was dead, so our server was really annoying asking us if we ready to order every 2 minutes. Ordered a small pizza with red bell peppers, italian sausage, and pepperoni. Crust was really soggy first couple bites but as you eat towards the end it is so crispy and delightful. Ingredients tasted very fresh and flavorful.

My girlfriend Lisette had been harping on me for weeks to try this place, and she finally convinced me to leave the house and meet her at Cibo. When I pulled up to the restaurant to my pleasant surprise it was a quaint building reminding me of a house in Washington. The food was delicious, and the service was quick and friendly. Although there was a larger party seated next to us, it did not distract from the over all experience. I was very pleased, and look forward to returning again!

Best to eat in, take out always seems to be smaller portions than what you see when you eat in.

I moved into this apartment complex because I had no other options due to the fact that my boyfriend (at the time) had terrible credit and could not get approved anywhere else in Old Town. Reana and her other staff member (who was eventually fired) seemed very friendly and like they cared about making everything super easy for us. After we signed the paper work and already gave them money to move in, they let us know the apartment wasn't ready when we had paid them to move in. I had no choice but to move into a un-finished apartment because my other lease was up and I could not renew at that point.  When they said the apartment was unfinished they were not kidding, they didn't even paint the walls again, there was crayon markings on the wall, mold in the corner of the shower, the apartment just looked so run down and dirty, nothing like the model they showed us. The painting on the drawers and cabinets were chipping off, and even the vent above the oven had paint that had been chipped off and it was just metal showing. I could not believe my eyes. I did the walk through so detailed and wrote down every little thing that was wrong with this apartment. When I turned my walk through in and expressed that I wanted this stuff fixed they said they would. They never came back to repair or finish up the apartment at all.  Over the span of time that I lived there, I had to put in a work order at least twice a month. The garbage disposal was constantly breaking, the toilet was not working at all in the guest room for months. They tried to blame me saying I put litter down the toilet from my cat, and I told them to go look on the back porch in the trash can that I had disposed litter in.  My AC unit started to leak and leaked water onto the carpet below, and they said they couldn't come when I mentioned that could create mold and that's a health issue Reana sent someone over. You had to argue with Reana to get her to do anything because she was so lazy and unappreciative of her tenants. My sink in my master bathroom was clogged for over a month, and I had called every week and it was always an excuse why they were not there yet to fix the issue. I looked in the electric box in my apartment one day, and discovered the apartments were built in 1974, and it's obvious they have never done any remodeling. There are also roaches crawling around outside the apartments, and sometimes I found a few in my apartment. Clearly they are not making sure their tenants maintain a clean dwelling unit.  The cops were called at the complex at least once a month for something going on with a tenant, and loud neighbors everywhere. Most of the tenants let their kids play and scream all day and most of the night outside with no adult supervision. I could never talk to any of the parents about these issues at my apartment complex because no one spoke English, nor would Renea ever attempt to control the issue. Her other staff member Suzy would always hand the phone to Renea whenever there was an issue because Suzy didn't want to deal with it either.  When I moved out of the apartment complex, I spent an entire day cleaning my apartment to make it like new, vacuuming/shampooing the carpets, repairing an wall damage my ex had left, and made sure it was livable for the next person since I knew the staff wouldn't ready the apartment for the next person. I did my own walk through of the apartment, and took pictures of everything, including the floors.  After I moved out, I received a bill from Oasis for $250 for pet damage, and "red stains" on the floor. I called and spoke with Renea about the damages, and let her know I had pictures of the floors and there was no red stains, and she said, "I have pictures too, and there is." When I asked her to show proof of these pictures, she refused to show me anything, and I even offered to go down there and see the unit and she told me no. She then said she will send the bill to collections, and I informed her that's fine I would be happy to dispute it and let it become a legal matter seeing as I work in an attorney's office. She magically stated out of nowhere that was fine and that was what her attorney and supervisor advised her. She also tried to say, "You had a cat in the unit and were not paying for it." My reply, "Renea I did let you know I had a cat because when I put in the 20th work order I told you to tell the workers to be careful my cat did not get out, and you never asked me to come down to sign a new agreement to pay more." She had no reply.   Save yourself the trouble and don't move in here. It was the WORST living experience of my life. The location in Old Town is not worth it.

This place has negative reviews for a reason, because the great customer service only lasts for your first few visits. I initially went here because they had a Groupon, and I did not feel like spending a ton on a cleaning. They offered me a discount to have my cavities filled if I had it done in three months, I thought sure that's a good offer. Everyone was really friendly and would confirm my appointments promptly etc. I had my cavities filled, and shortly after my right top one was still very sensitive and hurt any time I ate anything cold, or sweet. I let them know and they had me come in to fix the issue. I went back 3 times, and it's still the same. I recently scheduled myself for a cleaning, and they said they would contact me if someone canceled for a 9 am appointment. They emailed me to let me know they had a cancelation and that I could come in Wednesday. So on Wednesday I drove out there, I live in Phoenix so it's a 30 minute drive for me. When I arrive the doors are locked and there's another girl waiting outside. I think to myself, "That's odd." I am trying to kill time so I decide to go through my emails, and of course they emailed me to cancel the appointment. Saying something came up etc. Never called the day before to confirm cancelation. Just an email.... I emailed them saying I never received notice of the cancelation and that I was upset about this. I received a call, that I chose not to answer since I was at work, and the lady left a message saying they had called and left a vm too canceling the appointment. I have my cell phone on at all times in my office and never received any of this. I emailed her back letting her know, and instead of caring enough about me as a patient and trying to fix the issue I didn't get a response back.  I work in a law firm so I understand how important it is to confirm cancelations because people don't always check their emails and you can't assume they do either.

I really liked the wide selection of beers that they offered! However I do think they need more seating for busier nights!

I had the Smothered Tots, and the Beef burger with cheddar, sauteed onions, and avocado!  The smothered tots are by far my favorite of any junk food to munch on! I always have cravings for smothered Tots, and now I can just go here to satisfy the cravings, and it's such a relaxing environment. The burger was good too, I am not adventurous to try anything else like Bison, but I enjoyed the beef!

Chance was handling my move and he did a fantastic job. Very friendly and went as fast as he could given we had to use an elevator and I am on the fourth floor. I had one minor scratch on my entertainment center through the entire move, and he instantly told me to make a claim when he noticed it. I appreciated his integrity.  This company was a little less then anywhere else that I called and they were very upfront about the time and cost right away, which again, I appreciated the honesty. I referred my boyfriend and his friend to use their services and I am happy they are going to!   I recommend this company if you are looking for a positive and honest moving experience.

I placed an online order for a 8" sub and a large iced tea, and received an email confirmation and also the automated confirmation on their website. The message said the order would be delivered in 45 minutes, and it being a Saturday I expected my order to take the full delivery estimated wait time. After an hour went by, I decided to call the store and find out if my order was on it's way yet. I have been ordering from Silver Mine Subs for 5 years, and never had a very long wait time, especially on such a small order and always living near a location. When I called the store, the first person I spoke with said he did not receive my order to their system and that he didn't know what to do, that they just didn't get it, that they had been having issues with their online ordering, and I could just re-order. I stated that that was not acceptable and they needed to fix this issue and asked to speak with a manager. He put a "manager" on the phone, who actually admitted that he was not a manager and only a shift leader. I expressed my frustration with lack of solution from speaking with the first employee, and the shift leader was no better. There was no empathy, or concern for keeping my business and he stated that there was NOTHING he could do and that I needed to call corporate. My order also totaled $12.60, however charged my account for $16.13, and when I mentioned that information, he as well said that it wasn't his concern and there was nothing he could do.  I even suggested that he deliver my food personally and I will show him my receipt for purchase to prove I wasn't trying to scam him, and he said he would not do that, and that if I wanted food, I need to re-pay and he would bring me my order. I kept asking him if he was being serious, or if this was a joke because never in my life have I ever had such terrible service, and he insisted there was nothing they were going to do, and that I needed to call corporate. I asked him for the corporate number, and he stated he didn't have it, and that I had to go online to get it. I politely told him to "eff off", and called the websites corporate number, where I got someones voice mail. I left a message with my name, number and story of what had happened and never received a call back. This morning I called the store to see if maybe I could finally talk to a manager. I was able to talk with Justin, who repeatedly apologized once I told him the full story, and he sounded so embarrassed. He offered me to come in for my order this evening, and that he would also provide a gift card for future purchases as long as it meant keeping me as a customer. Funny how he also mentioned there was only three people working that time of day, and he knew exactly who I was talking about and that they have had previous problems with that employee. So all in all, I cannot say that I will ever eat from here again after I am done using the gift card, and the only reason I will use the gift card is because I do not want to waste it. Although the manager Justin finally fixed the problem, it still does not sit well with me that this could ever happen again at this location nearest me, and that a well known business in Arizona would hire people who act this way towards customers, and they knowingly kept him having had previous problems. I understand there are people who make mistakes at their jobs, but is the juice really worth the squeeze? Not for this girl.

Went here with my girlfriend for Happy Hour food, and everything was great! We had the guacamole, corn, and some tacos.   My only difficulty was finding parking, but I am also stubborn so that's probably why I became so frustrated.

It's really sad to see someone make fun of someones appearance in their review, and just goes to show that people only want to complain when they have something negative to say. I was quoted for front and rear breaks a few months ago when I had my oil change, I came back over the weekend to have the breaks completed and found out that I only needed the front after all, and had all the fluids flushed. I received a greater discount than the coupon online, and David was friendly and kept everything quoted as last time I went in. These guys are always very nice and friendly and deserve respect just as anyone else, we're all adults here, let's act like it.

Defiantly come here to eat! The Pecan Pie is the best I have ever had, and their peach almond muffin is to die for! Their zucchini bread is amazing also! Coffee and a perfect pairing of snacks available if you enjoy pastries.   My go to is the black iced coffee. It's perfectly delicious.

Took my boyfriend here for a going away dinner as he was leaving for vacation the same weekend, and I wanted to wow his pants off with somewhere we have not tried yet that would have different and fun ingredients. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we ended up parking in the same garage as the restaurant so it worked out to our advantage that the other lot was full.  Service was great, waiter was very polite, prompt and gave great suggestions.  The food was amazing! We had the Deviled Eggs, Tater Tots, and Risotto balls for apps. The smaller portion was perfect to taste, and not leave us too full. I ordered the scallops and he ordered the rib-eye. The rub on the rib-eye was amazing, and the scallops melted in your mouth.   I will defiantly be back here with him to try other menu items! I made reservations at 9 on a Saturday, and there was barely anyone in the dining area so I don't feel the need to do that again.

Honestly after reading the bad reviews... You can tell its coming from people who have never worked a service job. I come here for exactly what I know I'm gonna get-cheap drinks. If you want exceptional service  go to Mastros city hall and pay $15 for the same cocktail. It all goes back to people working by what their paid. Duh.

I love this place! It is my boyfriend and I's go to spot for Sushi. They have a great variety, and as someone who does not eat raw fish, I love how many options they have with shrimp, crab, and lobster. I would have to say I eat here once a month and I will continue to go here.

I asked for a iced coffee, add sugar free vanilla, and skim milk. The girl at the register and the shorter girl stated they didn't have skim milk, but they had soy. I said no thanks, I'll just have the sugar free vanilla then.  I watched her make my drink and add whole milk then she handed it to me. I said, "Im sorry, I asked for no milk, I don't think you heard me." The girl at the register continued to argue that I asked for a latte and that has whole milk. I said, "No, I said no milk since we just had the conversation in the past 3 minutes that you did not have skim." The girl still wanted to argue, I literally had to say to her, "There's no point in arguing, can I have the correct drink I paid for?" She rolled her eyes, and told the girl to remake the drink.  I can't believe that people who work in a customer service position want to argue over something so petty such as a drink order? On top of her lack of customer service, she had extremely long fake finger nails on, some had fallen off, and to my knowledge of food service you cannot have long fake nails, or fake nails at all! I hope no one had a nail come off in their food!  Who's running this place, and why aren't there more standards here? I will never come back here.

Tried this place for the first time Saturday, and I must say they live up to their name! For $22 you can get a giant pie with up to 5 toppings and the best part is the toppings are fresh and the wait was only 20 minutes. I am defiantly coming back here regularly.

So happy I came here instead of GNC, the associate Garret was extremely helpful and friendly. He recommended a delicious iso100 whey and the customer service was above and beyond! I have been to the Scottsdale location before and I will continue to go to this location as well! Keep up the good work guys! I never leave disappointed.
