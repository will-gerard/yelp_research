I had the Philly sub with the works. It was all very good. The side was a jalape√±o & cheddar mashed potato pie. It was spicy, very good.. Worth trying. They have a lot of green chile options & you can even take home a jar of their green chile mayo. They have take out. I have also ordered the green chili mac and cheese to go... also a good choice.

I placed a huge order at this Taco Bell, and the manager, Tony, was great! The staff was friendly and the service was fast! They got my order out in no time, and continued to serve other customers while they filled my large order. I would definitely visit this location again.

Being that it was located in the Bass Pro Shop I had expected more from this restaurant. It was okay, but not the best place to go for fish. I had scallops, shrimp & linguini in a lobster sauce. The portion was large, though it only came with three shrimp and three scallops. My date had their specialty fried fish sandwich. The sandwich and coleslaw were lacking in flavor. It wasn't bad, but there are definitely better places to go for fish.

I was involved in a promotional video for a non-profit that was created by Sonoran Studios. They did an amazing job with the video. I have known Neil for many years, he is professional and knowledgeable. I highly recommend using their services, the end results are high quality. If you have videography needs, I suggest you give Neil a call!

My battery light was coming on and the guy at Jiffy Lube told me that I needed my alternator replaced. My battery was just replaced less than 6  months ago. They were friendly, and I got my car back within 24 hours, even though they had to order the part. I thought the hourly rate was fair. They did try to sell me a battery, but when I insisted that this one was new and if it didn't make it I would take it back b/c it should still be under warranty, they told me they would put it on the charger (and luckily it came back). I can understand that in most cases when ppl drive around with their battery light on it drains the battery. I took my car in asap once the light came on so I think that is what saved the battery. I was happy, and after the service they sent me a nice thank you note and coupons for future services. I have to say that they follow up with new customers was really impressive to me. I would take my car back to them again.

This store is just amazing and so are the people that work there. I started training for a half marathon and my trainer suggested I get new shoes. I went into the store and two sales people evaluated how I walked, then they gave me shoes to try on... they wanted me to go outside and run in them. Most places once you wear a shoe outside it is yours. I found a great shoe and they threw in a free pair of socks. It was a little more money than you might find online, but the customer service makes it worth every penny. They told me to come back if I had any issues. Well, a week or so later I found that my ankles were hurting, so I went into the store, explained my problem and the sales person explained that I had tendinitis. He had me use this foot rocker to stretch out my calves and said I should do that three times a day. I never felt pressured into buying the foot rocker, but I ended up getting it. He also said if it doesn't go away to come back and they can give me the contact information of some great physical therapists. If you are starting out running I would highly recommend you go visit these guys... and if you are an experienced runner and want the attention to detail and great customer service, this is the place to go. I was so impressed.
