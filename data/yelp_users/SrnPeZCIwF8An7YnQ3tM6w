Ick. Just ick. They gave us a smoking room even though we requested Non-smoking. Why smoking rooms even exist anymore are beyond me. Since we only had 5-6 hours there to catch some shut-eye and take a shower, I didn't even bother changing rooms, but that amount of time was more than enough spent there. The breakfast buffet was decent though and we enjoyed waffles, pastries, and more before our drive to Monument Valley. I would never stay here again or recommend it, but maybe if you need something close to the airport for one night and are a smoker that actually enjoys smoking where you sleep, this hotel might be for you.

Beautiful hotel with large suites and great amenities. One of the most beautiful ones on the strip in my opinion. Check in and check out was fast and easy and even though we were just there for two nights, it was worth it. The restaurants are great an plentiful and the tables are lucky. Good choice of clubs/lounges as well. Definitely recommend a stay here if you are in Vegas!

Delicious sandwiches! Go for the Pastrami Reuben!!! That one is absolutely the best one of the ones we tried (and we ate here twice in two days!) Cheap and quick meal and very convenient if you are staying in the Venezia Tower. Go here for those in between meals and snacks between gambling, clubbing and eating at the fancier spots!

Nice hotel connected to the Venetian. We stayed at the Venetian, but this one looks pretty nice as well. The restaurants and bars/lounges are plentiful and the location is great.

Nice experience at this restaurant! It was pretty and quite comfortable. The staff was friendly and it overall had a very approachable vibe. The bacon appetizer is delicious, but be prepared because it sure is spicy! The sriracha wings were ok as well to much on. The lobster mac and cheese was a bit runny, but still ok. The lobster pasta was nice as well. If you are a steak lover, the filet mignon is very good! They make a great mojito as well, so wash everything down with that! Yum Emerils!

Great lounge experience. Door staff and cocktail waitresses were really nice. We got VIP seating and two bottles for the price of one. Fun place with good music and nice vibe. Definitely recommend getting bottles and a table if you wanna have a home base to sit and rest your feet after lots of dancing!

Friendly service and quick to get you to your car. The free bottled water is a nice touch and I would definitely rent from them again. We decided to pass on the upgrade for a few dollars more, but ended up getting upgraded anyway for free. I guess that is what winning feels like!
