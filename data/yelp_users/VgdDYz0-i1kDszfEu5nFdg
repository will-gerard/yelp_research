We went here last night on our way home.  I love that they are open late as we didn't get there till after 10 pm.  If you go earlier, be prepared for a long line/wait.  The food here is always consistently good.  B/F loves the Chimayo Chicken with their fabulous Green Chili Potato.  Last night he had the roasted corn for the side which was amazing.  I got one of their specials - Swordfish with an fantastic pineapple cilantro salad and my sides were the GCP and zucchini.  Excellent meal all around.  My only complaint is, I wish they would get rid of the tv's or make it in a section that is away from the dining area.

This little restaurant is off the beaten path and worth going to!  In my opinion, it is the best American Chinese food in the Valley.  Great friendly service and the food is fantastic.  Tthe best beef & broccoli EVER with a fantastic satiny sauce.  The regular (not spicy) chicken with vegetables and the sesame chicken are also wonderful.  We iwll be back.

This is the best library (other than Burton Barr which is 4 floors and hard to beat).  The Staff are always friendly and when you use their 'hold' system, you can get in and out really quickly.  The only complaint is, for the 2nd busiest library in Phoenix, they sure have a small parking lot.

They have a good selection but their store is not laid out very well.  If you don't understand the layout of this store, you can get completely lost.    Also, their customer service is hit or miss.   Went up to the customer service counter and stood right in front of a girl and she completely avoided me.  Would not look up or acknowledge me in any way.  I left and decided to try to do my return at the regular register and that worked fine.  When we were checking out, there was a long line for the single teller that was open.  A second teller opened up and, rather than saying "next in line, come to my register", they took the last person in the line.  HELLO???!?!?  Definitely no customer service at this Ace Hardware location.

We always get our Chicken Walnut Sandwiches on sourdough - mmmmm.  This is the best Paradise for service and consistent food quality.  I don't know if it is because they are so busy or because this is their training location.  The only thing we don't like is, they continually treat us like we are newbies, even when we hand them a Paradise Frequent Customer card (It gets tiring to continually tell them "yes, we know our order comes with cookies but we would still like to order extra cookies").  Even when the line appears long, they move it along very quickly.

We did the T-Bone Steakhouse ride.  It was about 1.5 hours out to the restaurant and then just over 1 hour on the way back.  This is a great thing to do with folks from out of town to have them experience the desert, see the view of the city of Phoenix, have sunset views among the cactus and really feel like they have experienced the Southwest.  We were fortunate that our ride coincided with a full moon so it made for a beautiful ride back in the moonlight.

We went to Ruffino's at the last minute for Happy Hour.  They were wonderful at accommodating our party of 7.  The service was incredible - so friendly and prompt.  They have a fabulous Happy Hour with great wine, drink and appetizer specials.  Their Seafood Martini is fabulous!  Will definitely be back.

We were working with Paulo at Shasta Pools to get the pool design we wanted within our price limit.   Paulo was not helpful in his suggestions (i.e., we told him we wanted a rectangular contemporary pool and he would present a drawing for a round oasis type pool)  There weres MANY lags in communication, from when we would leave Paulo voice mails or emails and the time when he would get back to us.  Paulo continually complained that email didn't work and wasn't efficient. (Seriously?  What century are you in?!!)    At the end of the month, there were "special deals" that were expiring as they wanted to pressure you in to signing.  Then Paulo would be busy and not get back to us and say "don't worry, I will take care of you as you are my special customers and I will make sure you get this deal next month."  When we got to signing, Paulo tried to pressure us into signing for a bigger pool.  We didn't want a bigger pool.  He then lowered the price on the bigger pool.  When we tried to understand why he couldn't offer the same incentives on our smaller pool design, Paulo wouldn't phone us back.    We finally had enough of this frustrating experience and looked on yelp to discover that Thunderbird Pools had 5 stars.  From the first phone call to Lisa at Thunderbird to dealing with Cohl the whole experience was different.  We wasted months with Shasta and from when we started talk to Thunderbird till we signed to move forward with the pool it was less than 2 weeks - and they love email! If you are thinking of building or renovating a pool, check out Thunderbird Pools.  You will thank me!

The food at Pita Jungle is really good.  I love everything I have had there.  If you are there in the fall or spring, sitting on the patio overlooking the lake is really nice.

I have been going to Nick & Candy for several years now as they are close to my work.  I go in at lunch and Nick does my nail fill for me in just over 1/2 hour!  How great is that?!  :-)  Candy gives heavenly pedicures and their prices are super reasonable (pedicures are $18, fill is $14 and a new set, including removal of the old set is $25).  They are fabulous about keeping your appointment time and not letting walk-ins take your time and then you are "squeezed" you in and making you late the way that other salons do.  I frequently phone Nick for a last minute appointment - sometimes he has them and sometimes not but, when you get a slot, you know they will cater to you during your scheduled appointment time.  Nick and Candy are both super friendly and give excellent service.

My g/f picked this place to go for lunch otherwise I never would have had it on my radar.  I also wouldn't have thought of an "egg place" for lunch. They have an extensive menu with traditional "egg" dishes like scrambles, omlettes, crepes but they also have salads and sandwiches and they also have a "Healthy" section on their menu.  I decided to go with the Spanish Omelette.  I wish I would have asked for no sour cream and a side of pico but, other than that, it was delicious.  It came iwth a slice of wheat toast and nstead of potatoes I chose the fresh fruit.  Very flavorful and filling.  The service was also very friendly and prompt.  I will go back.

The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner...until the roaches crawling on the walls, the tables - EEEWW!  Click on the date for any "complain inspection" and you will see they find roaches here - continually!  http://www.maricopa.gov/envsvc/envwebapp/tabs/results.aspx?navigatedFrom=businessResultsDrillDown&mc_perm_id=129281&business=SWADDEE%20THAI%20CUISINE&address=5055%20%20%20W%20%20RAY%20RD&permitid=SG48994  I have stopped going here and, instead, go to Yupha's Thai which is better food and, no roaches.  Note that the Via Linda location does not have any problems and, in fact gets awarded Silver or Gold awards from the Maricopa County Inspections.  It is only the Chandler location that is a problem and should be avoided.

We had my book club here.  A group of women descending on this one poor waiter would normally be a LOT to handle but, he was amazing.  He patiently explained what food and drinks were on Happy Hour as we bombarded him with our order.  Then more of our group arrived and he patiently went through the list again and took orders as well as additional orders for the original group.  I got the goat cheese and spinach flatbread and it was very nice.  Not too heavy on the topping and just a nice size.  Most others in my group got the "scotty" which was a generous portion of 5 slices of bread along with a marina sauce with thick goat cheese slices on top.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and the waiter did an impeccable job of checking back without being intrusive.  At the end, he gave all 7 of us separate checks and had everything separated perfectly.  If the delicious food and $5 drinks and happy hour appies weren't enough to win me over, the service made it a slam dunk.  I forgot to add that our waiter says to ask for "Gabe the Babe" and he will take care of you as well as he did us!  I would definitely come back again.

I went here for lunch with a g/f.  I had their sushi sampler and she got their Bama Roll with a house salad.  Both were excellent.  The house salad is a wonderful mix of freshness with the lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber and the light onion and soy dressing and richness with the generous touch of bleu cheese.  The sushi was all fresh and really good.  It was a tad more expensive than I generally pay for lunch but, I would go back.

I got the Jack Not Jill sandwich.  Maybe it was my fault for changing the hamburger bun out to wheat toast but, this sandwich was very lackluster.  The fries were soggy and not crisp at all.  I won't be rushing back and, if I did go back I would definitely order something different.

Other than a snotty girl who seated us in a crappy table and told us there wasn't anywhere else available, despite our reserving a booth, we had a wonderful time.  We quickly realized we were not going to deal with the attitude hostess girl and went back to the front desk where they promptly seated us in a booth.  The snotty girl needs to realize who is paying her salary - ugh, the customer!!  The rest of our evening was wonderful.  Excellent service, great food.  The Filet Mignon, chipotle mac & cheese that is always to die for and nice french green beans with mushrooms. Pricey but great food and so worth it for a special occasion.

Houston's is good but definitely not the caliber that they used to be.  The service was sub-par, the food was good this time but has been hit and miss the past couple of times.  They are missing the consistency that you used to be able to rely on.  Also, when we ordered a birthday brownie, they didn't bring a candle and they billed us for it - SERIOUSLY?! (the waitress knew as she said "oops, I forgot the candle")  Between that and charging $3 PER soda, it just seems like they are nickle and diming their customers to death.  J Alexanders has the same food with the same hit and miss service so, why pay more at Houston's.    The food we had this time was their spinach/artichoke dip with chips and we each got their chicken salad which seemed to have more peanuty spice to it which we enjoyed.  Their brownie dessert is to die for....probably literally with all that sugar but oh so good.  The total for the food and 2 sodas and tip was $70 (no alcohol!).  You can go to a lot better places for $70 or spend half as much for the same food across the street at J Alexanders.  Houston's no longer offers anything that distinguishes themselves or makes them worth it.

I am a chick and think HD has WAY too much stuff and you have to walk WAY too far but, this place is meant for guys....which means they love all the stuff and don't mind walking as they could discover something that they didn't even know they needed while they walk from one end of the store to other.  I have to say that whether you are a guy or a gal, you will find that the people here are very friendly and it is hard to prevent them from escorting you to the aisle  (no really, it is fine, just tell me the aisle number and I can find it!) of whatever item you asked for.  There never seems to be long lines so it is easy to check out.

I have been to the Swaddee in Chandler and know they do phenomenal sauces and pretty good food so, I was really looking forward to experience Swaddee in Scottsdale.  I had the exact same dish I get at their Chandler location - the red curry.  The sauce was meh, not so much.  Unfortunately the food definitely did not measure up and I think there are much better Thai places in the Valley.

When I moved and had to switch from my beloved Ahwatukee Foothills Vet I was very upset.  I never dreamed I could possibly find a vet I loved as much....until I met Dr. Barnes.  Now I can't imagine taking my boyz anywhere else.  He is thorough, patient and makes me and my dogs feel like they are the most important patients he has to see...which of course, we are, but hopefully he can make you feel that way as well!    My dogs have "vet issues" where they start to shake and act shy and as if they have been tortured (seriously, they do NOT act that way at home!) but, at Del Lago Vet this is gradually lessening with each visit.  Dr Barnes and his Staff always go the extra mile to greet both my boyz (and me) and spend lots of times oohing and awwing over them to make them feel welcome and comfortable.  I have had my boyz in there for routine check-ups, shots as well as one minor surgical procedure.  Heaven forbid either of them need major surgery or encounter serious illness as they age but, I would trust Dr Barnes completely. He explains everything and gets really excited drawing pictures to make sure you understand :-) and makes sure that I am completely comfortable before I leave his office.  All of his staff (hi Ruth!!) are also friendly and wonderful.  I HIGHLY recommend going there for your 4 legged baby's needs.

There are not enough accolades to describe how fabulous Thunderbird Pools are in dealing with attention to detail, their customer service, timeliness and quality of construction.  They are a family business with the husband and wife team (Cohl is out on the site and Lisa does the phones and scheduling).  We had been through so many frustrating meetings with all of the "big pool builders" before we sat down with Cohl.  Within 10 minutes of talking to Cohl, we knew we were going to go with him.  He knows his business and is honest enough to share his opinion of things he thinks won't work and why.  He brings a lot of great ideas to the table.  The finished product was so much more than we had envisioned and us extremely excited to get this pool built so we could see it!  I can honestly say that this is the best construction company that I have ever dealt with.  Cohl is a perfectionist and checks up on everything at every step of the way and doesn't hesitate to get things corrected (even minor little things, he notices and fixes - no shortcuts!).  Lisa emails with the schedule for the next few days or week so we know exactly what to expect and when - and they stick to it!!!  Once, we had a forecast for rain and they instantly emailed and said "if it rains, we won't be able to proceed until Thursday."  I constantly joked with Lisa and asked if they would do the renovations inside my house as I certainly can't get contractors to show up on time and to knock out the work the way that they do.    I would HIGHLY recommend Thunderbird Pools as you will know that your pool build/renovations will be executed flawlessly and you will be extremely happy with the end product.

Southwest Airlines is phenomenal!  Free for 2 checked bags, reasonable ticket prices, frequent flier perks and friendly staff.  The only things I would change are:  - People willing to pay for EarlyBird Check-in should not get prioritized ahead of A-Listers who have been paying for their tickets with SouthWest for a long time - You need to fly to Hawaii, Mexico (not just with partners, but so the SW Air perks still work) the Caribbean....oh heck, just go Worldwide.

Stopped in for a glass of wine with a g/f and sat at the bar.  Feels very tired and old.  Also, a glass of mediocre wine and an ice tea being almost $15 is crazy?!  Definitely much better places in the area that I would go to instead.

I went here with my book club and they definitely gave us lots to roar about.  Their Happy Hour is only good in their bar (which was fully packed) or out on their patio.  Their patio is fabulous!  Who would have thought a patio in Arizona in July could be so cool and welcoming.  Great atmosphere.  The waiter was very accommodating about all of us arriving at different times and peppering him with various drink and food orders.  I had the most delicious Huckleberry frozen margarita.  Perfectly smooth (out of a machine to be that consistent).  It was basically a plain lime margarita with a generous drizzle of huckleberry sauce on it.  The huckleberry sauce was slightly tart (not syrupy or sweet) but delicious!  It went down very smooth.  I had the fish tacos which were messy and the salsa verde was finger licking good.  I am amazed that, during the summer, they have Happy Hour until 10 pm!!!  Woohoo!  Overall, a delightful experience and I will go back.

Love the food and the service, especially if you get Shay, is impeccable. We have frequently said she is the reason we keep going back (ok, it doesn't hurt that their food is also great).  She not only remembers us as we go there at least twice a month but, comes to the table with our drink orders - how's that for service?!  We love their guac appetizer, their salads, buttermilk chicken and green chili pork.  I am sure everything on the menu is great but, we love those so much we haven't tried anything else.  The couple of things that are negatives are the nasty attitude of the people at the front desk.  They also insist on reservations.  There are so many empty booths and tables and yet they will turn you away at 9 pm on a Friday if you don't have a reservation.  We then made a reservation through Open Table on our phone and they immediately seated us.  SERIOUSLY??!?!?  Still, the food and atmosphere are great.

The atmosphere on the patio is nice with the fountains but it isn't nice having dinner to the smell of chlorine.  The food was ok and the server had no problem honoring the yelp complimentary chips and salsa.  We each got the green chili chicken burrito.  The food was laden with cheese and not for the cholesterol conscious.  It was hard to taste much besides the cheese and the spice but, there was chicken in there too.  If it weren't for the patio/water feature, I don't think this place would be in business.

Anytime we need anything adjusted, we take it to Zizzo's.  They are the best in town.  We have had all different items of clothing - jeans, pants, dresses - adjusted there.  I recently took in a bathing suit top and Phil told me right out that he didn't want to do it as he was concerned the material wouldn't lay properly after it was adjusted.  You can't beat that type of honesty.  For a small place, they do a TON of business but treat everyone as if they are their best customer.  Friendly, efficient and GREAT quality tailoring.

This Trader Joe's is friendly and offers the same great TJ's products.  What needs is improving is their parking lot!  It is so bad that Insurance companies should charge a premium for folks willing to play Russian Roulette by parking here.  I make a point of parking at the far end of the lot to avoid playing smash up derby with the elderly patrons.  Love the proximity to my home as I will be a regular here!

I am a carnivore and I loved this place!!  I got the Spicy Peanut Salad.  It had a nice miso vinaigrette  dressing that wasn't too tangy but had a nice zip.  The salad was very fresh.  I wasn't wild about the texture of the mock chicken and the pieces were too large but, the flavor was good and definitely added to the salad.  We also split green hummus appetizer - OMG!!!  Definitely order that.  The pita chips are fried and nice and crispy....the hummus is a wonderful texture and the flavor tasted like more!  We also split the samosas which I wasn't as wild about.  I was expecting spicy Indian chutney type of samosas but instead, these were more sweet (picture apple turnovers) Middle Eastern type of somosas.  Not bad but not what I was hoping for.  The portions are large for the price and I left feeling very full.  I would definitely go back again and get the hummus and maybe try one of their curry bowls which looked really good.  Great value for the money and nice to know I was actually eating healthy for a change.

I went for the first time today to Tott's at lunchtime.  It was excellent.  The service was friendly and accommodating (they had no problem substituting my rice for broccoli) and the food was fabulous.  It came to our table very quickly and everything was hot, nicely seasoned and very fresh (love crisp broccoli!)  I can see why this place is so busy/popular.  I will definitely go back.

We had a wonderful dinner here.  We sat out on the patio (they need to grow their hedges another foot or so to block the parking lot and then it would be perfect).  My boyfriend got the lasagna and I got the special which was various fish including shrimp and calamari and some of the most wonderfully done crispy fresh vegetables.  Both of our meals were SMOKING HOT which I love!  The portions were a little smaller than we are accustomed to at Italian places so, next time, we will get an appetizer or salad.  It is wonderful discovering a great little restaurant so close to home and we will definitely be back.

I went to Sushi Eye for Happy Hour.  The service was spectacular as were the drinks but, the food was just ok.  The seaweed in their rolls was very 'chewy', the tempura was oily and not fresh.  I have much better luck with Teharu.  That being said, it was an excellent value for the money on Happy Hour so can't complain about that.

I love this venue as it shows Independent and Foreign Films.  It has a nice retro decor and very clean.  All of the Staff is friendly and I love that they now have the automated ticket dispensers if you are paying by credit card so you don't have to wait in line.  It makes it so quick and easy to get your tickets, pay for them and walk in and find a seat and enjoy the show.

We went here for my bookclub.  The waiter was fabulous, despite being slammed with a few other large tables.  He took the time to understand my wine preference and made a great recommendation (which I unfortunately can't remember).  I had the cream of mushroom soup which was wickedly rich and creamy and the house salad which was nice.  It would have been the perfect light dinner had the bread not been so delicious that I also enjoyed too much of that - my bad.  Will definitely be back to experience some of their other dishes.

The only reason we went here is that my favorite place, the Gelato Maker, is closed on Mondays.  This place scores points for the  cute decor but, that is about it.  Their gelato isn't near as good as the Gelato Maker, it is quite pricey and the service is horrid.  Even my teenager nephew made a comment about the girl serving us and said "I don't think she likes her job too much."  There is much better quality for less money at Gelato Maker.

As always, Va Bene is wonderful.  The atmosphere, service and food all hit the mark.  I met a g/f for lunch and, after a couple of sample tastings, we each had a glass of red wine and the special beef & feta salad.  Delicious.  We ended up being there over 2 hours.  The service continued to be attentive the whole time without rushing us.  The only thing I would change is for you to get a location in the North Valley!  I will definitely be back.

Love Yupha's for both lunch and dinner.  The service is friendly.  Lunch is fabulous as you get the soup and salad that you can prepare how you want, with their really good warm peanut sauce along with whatever entree you order.  Every dish I have ever ordered there is wonderful.   I drive a little farther at lunch to go to Yupha's as it is my favorite Thai place in the East Valley.

We got to about 1/4 of the Sun's games and are fortunate enough to sit in the 2nd row.  Being so close to the action means you don't talk - you are sucked in to the game!  I have never considered myself a sports fan until going to the Sun's.  If this review were based on how Sarver runs the team or how the team is doing, it obviously would not be 4 stars.  Yes, I miss the Nash-Stoudemire duo and their pick n roll moves but, there is still a lot of great entertainment.  I know I am in the minority but, I continue to hope that the team will gel and we are within a trade or two of actually being there.  In the meantime, based purely on entertainment value, we always have a great time going to the Sun's games.

The staff could not be more friendly and helpful without making you feel pressured.  I took my niece here for a needle felting class and she had a ball!  They were so encouraging of her talents and were so patient in explaining everything.  The first thing my niece said as we were leaving the store was "When I come visit you next time, I want to come back here again!"  She couldn't wait to show Grandma & Grandpa her partially completed teddy bear and as soon as we got home she sat down to continue working on him.  Definitely a fabulous day and a huge thank you to TY&F for encouraging my niece in the fiber arts!

Good warehouse club store.  The verdict is still out but, I may prefer the layout and selection of "the other" mondo club store but, this one is in a more convenient location for me.  Best tip I can give you is, don't go to any warehouse club store on the weekend - unless you enjoy insane crowds and long lines.

We went on Friday night at 8 pm.  Thankfully, I made reservations.  We were seated right away and the service was very friendly.  It is a cool, hip, casual atmosphere.  As others have stated, this place is NOISY!  There are a lot of hard surfaces (cement floors, etc.) that cause the conversations and laughter to rebound off every surface and reverberate.  It gets so loud at times you can't hear to have a conversation.  The waitress took a bit to come see us but, when she did, we definitely had her full attention.  She was friendly, well informed and more than happy to answer our questions and give us her thoughts on any dishes.  She knew her menu and gave great descriptions to help you decide.  I ended up ordering the Green Chili and my b/f got the Potroast.  We nibbled on the their housemade bauguette and it wasn't very long until our meals arrived.  One word - DELICIOUS!  OMG was it good.  The pork in my green chili was so tender and had the perfect amount of seasonings/spice.  The 2 slices of cornbread were silky and flavorful.  The portion sizes were perfect.  Not so much that you felt stuffed but you definitely weren't hungry - "comfortably full"  The taste of the Potroast that i had was also incredible.  The only mistake we made was ordering the chocolate cake.  The waitress said it was 'semi-sweet' and that should have warned us.  It definitely was missing the sweetness that we enjoy.  That being said, in hindsight, she did a great job of her description of the cake but we misinterpreted it.  On the drive home, we both commented on how fantastic the food was and a total steal for the price.  It is the type of meal that you would pay at least $10 more/plate anywhere else.  The only complain is the noise.  Everything else about this place is stellar.  I think next time we would come later and see if it is a bit quieter.

I went here for lunch.  The minute we walked in the smoke smell from their kitchen was offensive.  There were very few dishes under $13 and the portions are way too large.  Don't they understand people who pop out for an office lunch?  Even their "lunch specials" were $12 to $16!  The food quality was mediocre.  The waitress was excellent but, I wouldn't go back as there are so many other places I prefer.

This Paradise seems to do better than they were a few years ago - in friendliness of staff as well as food quality.  In fact, they may be comparable to the Shea & Tatum location.  Regardless, gotta love the Chicken Walnut Sandwiches on sourdough and their chocolate chip cookies.

Previously, this place has been more 'miss' than 'hit'.  Now they are under new management and it shows!  The tables and booths were clean, the staff was friendly, service was prompt, and the food was excellent.  So nice to have this location finally under good management (hi Deborah!) and it is running like a well oiled machine.  We will definitely be back.

I went here tonight with a g/f and got the house salad (delicious!) wine and creme brulee for dessert.  All of it was excellent.  Very cute atmosphere.  They had an interesting menu with other things I would love to check out.  I would definitely go back again.

Went here for lunch and got the Pho which is always good.  This is convenient to get in and out of quickly and they give good service.  The food quality always seems consistent.

These people are WONDERFUL!  So friendly, reliable and great service.  I place my order one day on line or via phone and the order appears at my doorstep the next day - along with a little bag of bones/cookies!  My dogs think it is the best thing to have the "Cookie Man (or Woman)" show up and bring them treats.  It makes life so much easier to not have to lug a 40 lb bag of dog food home from the store.  Also, they are one of the few people in the Valley that carry Canidae food which is the brand/quality that I want.  Highly recommend them.

I normally order my Thai about a 4 out of 5.  I read the warning on Yelp about the heat, so I ordered a 2.  It was too hot. I  don't know why a restaurant would use such a different scale than every other restaurant in town but, that definitely detracted from my enjoyment of my meal.  It was "ok" food, divey atmosphere but the service was friendly.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here as there are so many other fabulous Thai places in town.

Had the chicken shwarma spicy with regular hummus and the pitas.  It was delicious!  Will definitely go back again.  Great place for a quick lunch.

I am usually a huge "Z fan" but this experience was not up to par.  As expected, we waited 1/2 hour for a table on the patio (why they have that beautiful glassed in patio for smokers is beyond me!)  The waitress was obviously slammed and our service was atrocious.  The food was mediocre at best.  I am not sure if this is indicative of this location but, my experiences at the Chandler Z have all been much better.

This is a great place for value, fun and quality - not to mention they get you in and out on your work lunch hour super fast.  You sit down, grab what you want off the conveyor belt and pay by the color of the plate.  My standard favs are Haru Sushi, Maguro Tuna and Rainbow Rolls - mmmm.  If I am super hungry I might throw in Gyoza or Jalapeno Poppers or a Spicy Tuna roll.  Not too long goes by between getting an email or an IM from a g/f saying "Fast Food Bait???" and I always say "YES!"

Went there again for lunch.  The selection was VERY poor with huge sections of the conveyor belt being empty.  Thankfully, if you asked the chefs, they prepared whatever we wanted.  I am not sure why the selection wasn't out on the conveyor but, we still got what we wanted and it was delicious.

Everyone at Buca is very friendly.  Their lunch is nice sized portions (unlike their dinner portions which are only suitable for "family style" sharing).  My g/f and I ordered their Apple Gorgonzola Salad and their Vegetarian Pizza.  Both were "just ok".  The salad had too many competing flavors including overly cinnamon seasoned walnuts competing with the other fresh flavors.  Also, their Italian vinaigrette didn't quite seem to match the other ingredients.  The pizza had a limp crust.  The toppings were nice with broccoli, peppers and mushroom flavors standing out.  Overall, the experience was 'ok' but I won't be rushing to go back.

I finally got to try Bombay Spice Grill last night and I loved it.  Wonderful service, great unique and flavorful food and a really nice mellow atmosphere.  We had my book club there and the waitress was fabulous providing us with wonderful service and gave all 9 of us separate checks.  The Happy Hour prices are fabulous!  I would definitely have the chick pea ceviche again - mmmmm!  I can't wait to go back and try more things on their creative menu.

I went here for lunch today and everything about it was mediocre.  The service was just ok.  They didn't seem very friendly and everything that we asked for seemed to put them out.  I got the Chicken with Broccoli and wanted it spicy.  My girlfriend got the Hunan Chicken.  Both meals came with egg drop soup as a starter which was very bland and nothing to write home about (nevermind on yelp!)  Then came our main courses.  Again, very bland (I asked for spicy but you would not have known it by this dish).  The chicken was such small thin pieces that I do wonder if it was something else.  The broccoli was fresh and the consistency of the sauce was nice but, it just needed some flavor.  My g/f's only ate about 1/4 of her meal.  I wish I would have read Renee's review about asking for the Chinese menu before I went here.  I will have to remember that if I ever end up back here again.

You have to love all of the public library systems we have available to us in the Valley.  I am a member of the Phoenix, Scottsdale and Chandler Public Libraries.  I have recently started frequenting the Chandler Public Library Sunset Branch as it is very convenient for my work.  I go online, put the item(s) I want on hold and they notify me when they are ready.  Picking them up is a breeze (although, like all libraries, their parking lot gets full) as I just grab the item(s) off the hold shelf, go to the self check out and leave.  The Staff is friendly and helpful and this branch has a very nice atmosphere.

We go here at least twice a month (ok, sometimes weekly!).  For those who haven't been here, it is cafeteria style where you walk through and place your order and get a number.  You pay at the cash register and then within a couple of minutes of getting your drink and finding a table, your food comes out to you.  Love their soups and salads and their chicken walnut sandwiches are absolutely amazing.  With most meals, you also get the most decadent chocolate chip cookie - mmmmm!  Great food and customer service.

Similar to Houston's but better.  We used to be Houston's regulars but now go to J Alexander's instead as they have consistent food quality and better service.   Love the warm bread and soft butter they start you with.  I had the burger and fries and it was delicious and cooked exactly how i requested it.  Usually get the Thai Chicken Salad or sometimes the Ahi Tuna Salad.  Food is always consistently good.

Excellent service.  We ended up being here on a business dinner for 3.5 hours!  The waitress knew when to leave us alone and when to come by - perfect pacing!  It made the evening a success.  I wouldn't order the Ahi Tuna Salad again due to the small portion size but, other than that, everything was perfect.

We went here again last night and had a fabulous time!  B/F got his favorite - the ribs - and I decided to try the French Dip.  I wasn't sure if I should order it as I am picky about my French Dip but, decided to live dangerously and OMG I am so glad that I did!  This was THE BEST French Dip I have ever had.  Perfect amount of horseradish, the dipping sauce was beautiful, the bun was fantastic and, best of all was the meat.  So tender you could literally pull it apart.  I am still drooling over how good that was and will definitely order it again.  This place blows Houston's out of the water!  We will be back.

I admit it, I am a Trader Joe's junkie.  I love TJ's!  Their demo counter becomes part of my household staples.  Everything is so good and their Staff is always friendly and helpful!  Some of my favorites are:  - Frozen mashed potatoes (ok, this is one of those items that it is almost embarrassing to admit that I don't make myself but, they are so darn good that if you tried them, you would understand) - Frozen breaded chicken tenderloin breasts - Wine Country pecan and cranberry chicken salad filling - White meat chicken salad filling - Frozen Mandarin Orange Chicken along with Veggie Fried Rice - Sliced cheese platter - Asiago bread - dip it in olive oil & balsamic vinegar...mmmmm - The red licorice from Australia - Frozen leeks (no more washing the dirt out of ever crevice!) - Oh the nuts!!!  The omega trek mix, sunflower seeds, pepitas, marcona almonds and dried cranberries - Potstickers - Frozen Thai Sticks - Mushroom Tortellini with asparagus  It is the best for Single Girl dinners:  - Chicken Chile Burritos - Tikka Marsala  If they were a publicly traded company, I would be the first to buy their stock!  Love them.

I needed a few items I had purchased from a g/f moved within one week.  All the movers I phoned were booked, including Get Your Move On.  Then Roger told me he would do it TOMORROW for me.  I said "Tomorrow? As in Sunday?"  He said yup.  If that wasn't enough, he told me the exact time he would be at my g/f's house and then at my house (no waiting for them to show up during a 4 hour window).  Wow!  Everything showed up in great condition and they were in and out of my house in no item with everything placed exactly where I asked.  Amazing customer service.  I would definitely use them again.

Took my sis here when she was in town for a late lunch that happened to coincide with their happy hour.  We each had a glass of wine and a salad.  The salads are really good and the happy hour prices are definitely right.  The beautiful atmosphere was so relaxing and the waitress didn't rush us at all.  So peaceful and great to catch up with my sis in such a serene setting.

We LOVE the Gelato Maker.  They have a great selection, are always very friendly and patient in giving out samples.  Their portion sizes are very generous vs. other gelato places and the texture and flavor are fabulous.  We have gelato places closer to us but drive 20 minutes to go here and it is worth it.  Love this place!

This is a fabulous casual place for lunch.  Good food, good prices and wonderful friendly service.  The manager ALWAYS comes by to check and see how everything is (what other casual dining place can you say that about?) and they remember you and frequently even know what you order.  Also, despite being busy, they get you in and out in a timely manner.  I love their Veggie Flatbread, Hummus wrap, Santa Fe Salad and Fiesta Salad.

I met a g/f here and we sat on the patio under the heaters to relax and enjoy the night air.  They have a decent wine selection with a couple bucks off per glass for Happy Hour.  None of their food is on Happy Hour which is strange but not a big deal.  We split the Swiss Chard Salad and the specialty pizza (lamb, mint and don't remember what else was on it).  Both were excellent.  I would definitely go back to this cool venue.

This is a great place to go for a quick $5 car wash.  I always pull around to their free vacuums and take a couple of minutes to do a quick vacuum and then chamois off my car and it looks great.  They could not be more friendly!  It sounds silly to say about a drive through car wash but, these guys wrote the book on customer service.

I work near here and have never gone in.  Today at lunch, a g/f and I went there and it was really good.  Great South Indian food and a nice clean atmosphere.  At lunch, they have a nice buffet with wonderful vegetarian selections for $9!  you can't beat that.  Order #77, 33 and 25 along with a #1 mango drink - split it with a friend or two and you will all be fat and happy when you leave.

EXCELLENT sandwiches and super friendly people.  All freshly carved meats.  Loved the oil and vinegar dressing on the sandwich.  Excellent value for the money compared to Quiznos or places like that and way better quality.  Would definitely go back again for lunch.

Love Jersey Mike's Subs.  The staff is all super friendly.  Be sure to get your sub "Mike's Way"  which is no mayo or mustard - they use olive oil and a sweet red wine vinegar along with some oregano: it may sound strange but it is fabulous.  Each sub is custom made so they do back up when there are a few people.  It is also not the cheapest in town but, you aren't getting the Subway deli slices either.  You get fresh cut meat and it is very flavorful.  I think the "mini" is mis-named as it is plenty large for me.  Definitely a fan.

Loved this place.  There is a LOT to take in and we barely covered 3 countries, the interactive museum and the artists exhibitions before we were all pooped.  Still, we had a wonderful time!  I have enjoyed concerts here before in their fabulous music hall and that is something I would highly recommend as well.

The atmosphere was very loud and not the 'cozy" that some yelpers described.  The pizza crust was soggy and limp.  The sauce tastes canned and doesn't seem to have seasoning.  The sausage and salami toppings were ok but didn't have that authentic Italian flavor.  The cheese on top was runny.  I am really surprised at the other yelp reviews on this place as, despite it being so close to my home, I wouldn't go back.  We have so many fabulous pizza places in the Valley but, for me, this is definitely not one of them.

I only popped in to have a quick drink with a friend.  Unfortunately, we didn't have time to order any of the fabulous food but, i have to say that i love the atmosphere of the Uptown Vig even better than the 40th St Vig.  The patio out back is fabulous.  Will be back when I have more time to enjoy.

Wonderful.  This is a cozy atmosphere with dark wood and booths.  Like a casual version of Capital Grille.  I love that they have a piano playing at night.  It is so hard to believe how healthy the food is as it is delicious and filling.  I have been here a couple of times and enjoyed everything.  One time I got the tiger shrimp and pasta which was fabulous!  The snow peas and broccoli were crisp and fresh, the tiger shrimp were huge and the flavor was phenomenal.  All of it was in the most delicious light sauce.  Another time, I split a flatbread and got the spicy tuna sushi - and that was excellent as well.   I especially love those little desserts - mmmm!  So far I have tried the peanut butter, rocky road and key lime pie and they are all exquisite.  The service is mediocre but, everything else is wonderful.

This is a fabulous little Thai place.  Very cool atmosphere, not so loud that you can't have a nice conversation and the Staff is all very friendly.  They have a fabulous Happy Hour with lots of small plates (which are GENEROUS portions) for $5.  I ordered the green curry and the shrimp and pork wontons along with 2 draft beers - all of this was only $17!!!  AMAZING!  I will definitely be back.

This is a wonderful little find with a husband and wife owner and the friendliest staff around.  I had a nice Petite Petit wine and my g/f had the bartender make her a custom hot toddy.  We started with a pot of the Tom Yum Soup and then had the flavorful Seafood Green Curry and the Beef & Broccoli.  Everything was good but the beef and broccoli was exceptional.  I will definitely be back.

Let me start with the positive - the service was EXCEPTIONAL.  Very friendly and attentive.  The margarita on Happy Hour was very good and the prices were excellent.  Now, for the negative: the food and the atmosphere.  The atmosphere is horrid.  As other reviews have mentioned there are kids running around during Happy Hour (really?!) and it is very sterile and lacking in ambiance.  The food was mediocre at best.  Definitely won't be making a return trip which is too bad as the service was wonderful and I love Cork,

The food is way too spicy.  Thankfully, I got a soft chicken taco that didn't have any sauce on it and that was quite good.  Still, not amazing.  Find it so hard to believe that this place is so renowned.  $30 for lunch for 2 with no drinks and not that much food seems insane - and half of our food was way too hot to eat.  The atmosphere was very lack luster.  Unlike other folks experience, the service was good but, I won't be seeking this place out again.

This was a nice little Vietnamese place.  Had a couple Spring Rolls for starters that were really good and the Veggie Pho which was excellent.  The service was super friendly (we stayed forever after we had paid our bill and they kept refilling our waters and didn't rush us out).  I would come back again.

I was so excited to try this place but, unfortunately, it didn't measure up.  It was pretty vacant with only a few patrons in the bar and one couple in the restaurant.  It had the feeling of a place that isn't going to survive.  We got the mozzarella, tomato and garlic flatbread which was very lacking in flavor and the crust was soggy.  Based on the waitresses recommendation, we also got the shrimp tacos.  They were ok flavor but, immediately fell apart - MESSY!  Overall, the food was ok but the service didn't even rate that.  Unfortunately, I won't be back as we are blessed to have so many other fabulous places in town.

Wow.  I am not a fan of casual bar type restaurants yet this place completely won me over.  From the impeccable service to the fabulous food, all of us had a wonderful time.  I HIGHLY recommend the Mixed Grain Salad.  I was worried it sounded "too healthy" for my tastes but, luckily we had the world's best waitress and she recommended I get the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and to have the Mixed Grain Salad as the side. MMMMMM!  The sandwich was really good but the salad was OMG out of this world!  Next time I will just get the salad.  Everyone loved their meals and the atmosphere was so relaxed.  Fabulous time and will definitely be back!

This is a wonderful little find.  We sat on the 2nd floor patio and it was the perfect fix for a busy day.  We sipped wine in front of the fire and watched the sky change colors over Camelback Mountain.  The service was fabulous.  They didn't rush us and without asking, split our shared orders for us.  The food was fabulous!  OMG!  You HAVE to get the walnut Gorgonzola salad with the warm sweetened balsamic dressing.  Mmmm.  I would get that again in a heartbeat.  We also split a flatbread with fries and it was excellent as well.  I will definitely go back.

The service was friendly and it seemed clean.  You place your order with the cashier, get your  drink, napkins, fork and sauces and then sit down.  They brought out our food in a timely manner.  If you like a bowl that is filled 3/4 full with rice and then a few ingredients put on top, you will love this place.  For me, this was not a good experience.  I had the small Arizona bowl.  While the portion size was generous, it was 3/4 rice.  On the top they put a scoop of mushed up imitation crab meat in some mayo and a sliced up avocado.  That was it.  No sauce, no flavoring, no nothing.  You can get teriyaki and soy sauces from the counter but, the bowl was  filled so full that you couldn't mix anything in until you had eaten the crab and avocado off the top.  My g/f got a small chicken teriyaki bowl.  This was also a bowl 3/4 full of rice with a few pieces of chicken on top and a very cafeteria tasting teriyaki sauce on the top.  I pictured them in the kitchen having a whole bunch of prepped bowls 3/4 full of rice just waiting to slap one or two ingredients on the top to fill the orders.  With so many good restaurants nearby (Sandellas right next door) I don't think this place will last for long.

Todd was very pleasant when I phoned to make my appointment to have my carpets cleaned.  He gave me a window when he would be at my house and said he would call me 1/2 hour beforehand.  Sure enough, on the appointed day, I got the phone call from Todd in the window telling me he would be there in 1/2 hour.  He quickly assessed the rooms and stairs that I wanted done and quoted me a very fair price.  I left him to work and he was done in less than 1.5 hours (and I had a LOT of large areas to do!)  The carpets not only look fabulous but, he got out several stains that I thought were permanent.  Thanks Todd!  Excellent service and price.  I will be calling you again.

I am NOT artistic but thought this sounded like a fun thing to do - and I was right!  They make this so relaxed and fun and easy - Painting for Dummies.  Ok, maybe that is my perception due to my being a beginner but, apparently others in the class were in the "Advanced" section based on their gorgeous results.  The Staff was fabulous.  They got us all relaxed, laughing and having fun.  In between giving clear easy to follow non intimidating instructions, they had a great variety of songs that they turned up to allow you to enjoy while you painted. Much to my delight, I also loved my finished painting!!!  I will definitely go back.  This is a great thing to do as a group - with friends or family or even a work event.  A total blast.

Another fabulous Happy Hour.  They have stupid fantastic Happy Hour prices with everything being $1 to $3 a plate.  I love these little plates that make it like doing  Tapas.  My g/f and I had loads of food to share and a glass of wine each and our bill was under $20!  I absolutely LOVE having Jennifer as my waitress - she is FABULOUS!

I always give a place the benefit of the doubt when I read such mixed reviews.  If something is stellar, then it is worth paying for..  This was not stellar.  In fact, it was more miss than hit.  We had 4 appetizers - the habanero & pickle was interesting and I would recommend it.  The squid which was mediocre to poor.  The farm bird lollipops were just ok.  The tuna poke was the one dish that was stellar.  We each had a glass of wine and that came out to $70.  Definitely not worth it with so many other fabulous restaurants in town.

When my g/f and I walked in, we instantly noticed the place was empty.  There was only one other table during the entire lunch hour! Yikies.  Not good.  The rolls on the conveyor belt were also pretty sparce.  Our first impressions were that we probably wouldn't be back.  I grabbed a spicy tuna roll off of the conveyor belt and was an instant convert - so fresh!  Yum!  The very friendly hostess/waitress readily took our order for sushi that wasn't on the conveyor belt - rainbow roll, maguru tuna and I can't remember what else.  What I do remember was the exquisite melt in your mouth freshness.  I am not sure why word hasn't leaked out about this place as there should be a line-up out the door.  I do admit that the location isn't the best (tucked in the strip mall across from Skateland but, we will definitely go back.

I love all of Johnny's restaurants and this one is no different.  Johnny did a great job of turning this space into a cool atmosphere with great knowledgeable wait staff and phenomenal food!  The atmosphere is clean, modern and hip with under bar lighting, sleek clean furniture and a modern feel.  The wait staff is very helpful and accommodating on everything from drinks to food to dessert.  We had the truffle edamame - mmmm, finger licking good!  The sochu tofu was very good with both the pineapple ginger and the sesame sauces.  The ginger mint duck salad was good but had too many competing flavors.  I had a peach martini drink that was the special of the evening and it was strong and oh so good!  If I hadn't been driving, I would have had three!!!  They have lots of fun events like Happy Hours, Tapas tastings, DJs and bands.  Definitely a great place and I will be back again.

We decided to sit on the patio by the heater and enjoy our beautiful Arizona weather.  I am not a beer drinker but, after all the reviews I figured I should give a beer a try.  I told the waiter what I was after (not yeasty or bitter, not too strong and a little sweet) He was so patient and brought out a couple of samples.  I loved the hefeweizen and ordered a pint of that.  My boyfriend got their home made root beer which was AMAZING (brought back memories of childhood).    The waiter was knowledgeable and answered all our questions about the menu.  We decided on pizza and a salad.  The house salad was phenomenal.  Such fresh ingredients with a light dressing and the most wonderful mixture of crunchy and slightly spicy nuts.  I could make a meal out of it and, next time I might!  For our pizza, we got half pepperoni and half fennel sausage.  Both were excellent.  We each liked our own half a bit better so it worked out great.  You HAVE to save room for these little "cake pops.  They are lollipops that are like a cake/cookie batter with a hard coating on the outside.  They come in many flavors - snickerdoodle, mocha, peppermint red velvet, gingerbread, chocolate coconut.  We got snickerdoodle and mocha and they were both excellent.  The perfect amount for dessert when you are full but still want something sweet.    They have only been open a week and are still working out a few bumps (the server disappeared a couple of times when we were looking for him) but overall, this was a fabulous experience.  How wonderful to have an independently owned little place like this right in our back yard.  We will definitely be back.

I love these guys!  Always so friendly and helpful.  They have a 'wheel wash' that you can do beforehand as well as vacuums.  I do think the driers are better at the other location which is why I didn't give 5 stars.  Still, amazing value for what you get....especially if you buy their half off gift cards at Christmas time.  The perfect stocking stuffer!  Fast, friendly, reasonably priced, convenient....you just lost your excuse to have a dirty car.

I work right around the corner from here I have seen many different restaurants come and go in this location so wasn't sure when I saw a sign for Cafe Cornucopia.  I probably wouldn't have checked them out had my g/f not told me how fabulous they were and wanted to meet there.  Boy, am I glad she suggested it.  Everything truly is homemade and you can taste the quality.  I was debating what to have and when I asked about the corn chowder soup, she said they didn't use cream or butter so, I wasn't sure if it would be brothy (which I didn't want).  She immediately offered to get me a sample and it was delicious!  I had the cheddar and chili quiche with a side of the corn chowder soup.  It was FABULOUS!  The soup was the perfect texture - creamy - very hot and flavorful.  The soup comes with a side of bread which was so insanely good.The quiche was the perfect texture with a nice cheesy flavor and just a hint of kick from the chilis.  My g/.f had the turkey avocado sandwich with the tomato basil soup and she said both were fabulous (and they looked it)  The service was friendly without being overbearing and you get a great vibe and can tell this is not a chain and they all really care about your experience.  I will definitely be back.

I have been seeing Dr. Kerr for 18 years now.  She is like going to see a wonderful country/farm doctor.  The front office is nice but, you don't spend long there as she is always running on time (no waiting 45 minutes like other doctors).  She sits down and listens to you.  She asks all the right questions to help her understand.  She then walks you through the options along with pros/cons (ranging from homeopathic to surgery) and helps you to decide on the right course for your situation.  She also does bio-identical hormones and is a big believer in homeopathy, which I love.  A couple of years ago, I moved from Ahwatukee out North but, I have kept Dr. Kerr as my primary care doctor as I couldn't imagine going to anyone else.  She has such a calm wonderful manner and spends the time to truly understand your needs.  In all the years that I have been seeing her, I have never had a bad experience with her.  I skip eating apples as I truly love going to my doctor and don't want to keep her away! :-)

Really good food and fun atmosphere with the surfboard tables.  Everyone was super friendly.  After ordering at the counter, we sat down and enjoyed the tv videos of surfers.  Our food came out very quickly.  The fish tacos were fantastic, albeit a bit messy.   I would definitely order those again!  B/F had the fish and chips and he really liked those as well as the coconut slaw.  They also have nice beer.  I think it is a bit pricey for the casual atmosphere (I can see folks being more willing to pay those prices on vacation in Maui).  That being said, if it was a fancy atmosphere, folks would pay those prices all day long and think it was a steal as the quality is so good.

This was our first experience parking in the East Economy lot.  We parked in the garage as for us, the $11 was worth the covered parking vs. the $9 for parking in the open.  The only negative was driving 'round and round and round' to get up to the level in the garage where there was available parking - not a big deal and worth it for the covered parking.  We took the elevator down to the main level and the light rail was right there and we walked right on.  It is a great set-up with the trains feeling very clean and modern and it is smart that they didn't put much seating in the trains so everyone has room for their luggage and you simply hold on to the hand rail.  It was only a couple of minutes on the train before the doors opened and we were at Terminal 4.  It was a quick escalator ride and then a short walk through a very modern walkway and we were in Terminal 4!  Very slick.  On the way back, we *just* missed the train so had to wait the 4 minutes till the next one and even this 'worst case' wasn't a big deal.  This was a seamless experience and we would definitely do it again.

Thank goodness they weren't busy.  There was only one other party in front of us and we still had to wait quite a while to place our order.  I couldn't imagine if the place was busy.  The fries are out of this world, the raspberry white chocolate shake was meh as it wasn't very thick and the burger was poor.  I asked for it medium rare and it was brown all the way through and VERY greasy.  Combine this with the loud atmosphere and I won't go back.  There are so many better burger places and it isn't worth going just for the fries.

I have been using Maria Isabel for over a year.  She goes all over the Valley. She is reliable. professional and has reasonable rates.  She always shows up at the agreed upon time and, if there is a problem she calls or texts me. She brings her crew and does the white tornado treatment, top to bottom on my house.  When she leaves, everything is sparkling clean and smells and feels so fresh. I highly recommend Maria as she does a wonderful job.
