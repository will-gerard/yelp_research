My husband and I shared 6 doughnuts on our first visit here. Perhaps not the most elegant detail to open with.   It has since become a favorite, as they have "an amazing bearclaw." I am not generally a fan of dough-based foods, so I like the fact that, though the oddly large and realistic pictures of the food are faded, other stuff IS offered. I usually stick with doughnuts for value and camaraderie, but plan to try one of their croissantwiches soon.  Blended drinks are from a powdered mix, but ok in taste. Nice selection of morning beverages.

I had the pleasure of enjoying their anniversary special for a few precious days--Tacos were back briefly! Too late now, but those are some delicious corn treats. Green chile burro, succulently meaty and delicious as it is, comes second. If you're reading this, you're already ahead of the game--can't believe my dad never told me about this place.

I found this place right after they moved to the current location, which is a true shame, as that address had neater doors (if I was at the right place), which probably led to a more comfortable eating space than the current General Hospital Cafeteria feel.   I started taking my orders to go, and have been much happier for it. The staff are friendly, if a bit cold. I don't mean to be offensive or impolite, but I find the looping spiritual lectures on the television in the "bar" (waiter station) to be off-putting, along with the waiters' intent concentration. I think they might have paintings by her on the walls, too. And a portrait. I hate the 1987 dining sets, and I don't like the plastic table coverings. I wish they served wine, but I guess it's probably against their beliefs, so I feel weird about complaining.   The food is so good, though. I love the stuffed tomatoes, nice texture, and the hot and sour soup is both hot and sour. Sizzling rice soup is also quite good. If you eat in, they deliver the fried rice and you can put it in and hear it sizzle. The tea they serve in the dining room is also missed by taking my food to go. The lemon chicken and sweet and sour pork are my favorite entrees, but I also like the duck and eel selections. The shrimp are so realistic, if not a spot on imitation. I do not particularly care for the juices they serve, but no entree has been unsatisfactory in the years I've been going in.   I just wish they delivered and had better hours, but I guess it isn't their thing.

I like the idea of all-you-can-eat hummus so much, that Princess earned almost all its stars for that. The lunch buffet consists of this, about Pita Jungle quality-hummus, which most seem to dig unquestioningly, plus a bunch of meat, a delicious chopped salad and rice and soup. I was a vegan at the time I visited, and had no problem stuffing my face with loads of hummus and rice on naan, with a bit of Sriracha hot sauce and loads of the pre-dressed salad. I think the meat is usually lamb (perhaps chicken, as well). Both times I've gone, my companions have been disappointed in this meat. One said it was too dry, the other that it lacked the proper seasoning (my dad's big on seasonings). I'd believe it, but I'd still go back.

This place charged double what they quoted and then got snippy when questioned. That's the worst combination of bad service traits possible. Fixed things that were not causes, but symptoms, of my problem. No progress was achieved, I dropped close to 800 for a starter and battery, which both had to be replaced again. They really shouldn't work on German cars as they seemed to be at a loss. Or any cars, as far as I'm concerned.

I once had a vase shaped like a pair of pants, complete with belt and jeans stitching details. Flowers stuck out of the waist. I'm convinced my husband broke it on purpose. I bought it here.   I also scored an original mini-oil painting of an owl in a neat little frame. I think I spent under 12 dollars for both. I spotted some nice vintage tables while I was there, but none were under 100, which wouldn't be bad if I weren't so poor.The guy working there had a friend visiting who had been working on a film with a police chase, so there was a white crown royal with the word "LICE" on it in big capitals, I guess he didn't need the front part any longer. The parking lot is creepy, but they close before dark.

I love the Curtis collection, as well as the fact that they have traveling, well-studied docents for free for teachers on a variety of subjects. Almost as good as a field trip. Wait, better, because the kids actually got to DO something and learn. A total success. Free Tuesdays ain't bad, either.

They mixed me a great gin and tonic here, and I dig the decor, low red twinkle lights and a bathtub-shaped beer tap "hub." So cute I actually took a picture, and I'm not a tourist. Bathrooms have swinging doors, which I like for some reason.   The band was covering classic funk, and snazzy-suited men took my money and held the door. Shirts tucked in, pressed pants and a nice hat and shoes snazzy, not "these are my best jeans" a la every other male bouncer ever employed in Phoenix. The makeshift patio space is comfortable, I get the feeling that (if it doesn't leak) it'd be awesome to sit out there on a rainy afternoon. Older clientele, but I didn't feel out of place, well, no more than at any other place I've gone. Definitely prefer the evening scene, it's just a little depressing during the day. The mark of a good night club!

I can't really give it a bad review, as it is the Humane Society, after all. I got one of my spunky cats there a few years back. She is busy eating now, but would otherwise say hey.   I went on a Friday to get my dog neutered. I now know it's only Tues-Thurs that this occurs here. I would normally have looked this up ahead of time, but I don't think there'd be anything particularly wrong with posting a sign with this information on the door, in order to prevent waits like mine (everyone said to get there early!). The hours they did have on the door were incorrect, anyhow, as they do not open until 8 on Fridays, not 7.   The assistant who came out 3 minutes before they were scheduled to open to let all of us know they didn't do that (apparently lots of people make the mistake, due to their being no sign and the place being called the "Spay and Neuter Clinic," not the "Vaccinations Clinic") offered me the "spay and neuter hotline," but it was a non-working telephone number. When I asked him about it, he said he tried it and it was just busy. Either he was kidding around with me/lazy, or is unaware that "the number you have dialed is currently not in service, or is assigned in a different area code," does not mean "we're currently experiencing longer than average wait times..." or any similar recorded message... it means what it says!   Anyway, while double-checking the hours and procedures (which are on the website, after all), I found out about a free voucher program for residents of Maricopa County. It says it only takes 2 weeks to receive a voucher, and does not mention anything regarding needs-based acceptance. You can even sign up to get licenses and rabies shots for dogs for 16 and 10 dollars (respectively), but this is optional, you can also simply request a voucher. Neat!  www.maricopa.gov/pets/pdf/bigfix.pdf  ---application, rules, etc.

I love this place. They have booths and booths filled to the brim with old jewelry, discarded photos, memorabilia of all kinds, china, dolls, books, paintings, etc. It's a bit difficult to get people who aren't also interested in antiques and collectibles and vintage to stay long enough to experience the whole place, as it is huge. I've purchased handfuls of brooches from the 50s-60s with original enamel and jewels for less than five bucks a pop. I'm always getting ideas from old beer coasters and portraits.

This is the only delivery burrito I've ever found, but I sadly live too far now (they actually cover a pretty big radius). I love getting a bean burrito with lettuce, tomato, and guacamole inside, which I'd never even bother ordering at another Mexican food place. They use good quality guacamole, the beans are cheesy and perhaps a bit salty, but the tortillas are really the best part. Each burrito is huge, and you can get a combo for around 5 bucks (or less). People really love their breakfast burritos, my husband likes the potato, egg and cheese with guacamole. Perfect for hangovers. Opens earlyish, at 8!

I used to love this place, but that's because I was a teenaged vegetarian without a car or the good sense to go into a restaurant that wasn't staffed by hipsters and next to a killer record store. The food is not bad, but it's so boring. They have seven ingredients, yet 45 dishes. The hummus is palatable, but by no means would it register as a "good" hummus.   I used to think the fetoush salad was enough for 3 portions, too, until I realized that fetoush does not keep. The "fetoush" part of it is the delicious croutons, if I'm not mistaken. If forced to eat here again, I'd try to get someone to split that with me, with maybe the salmon. If you are eating here because you are on a diet, get the waiter to bring you cucumbers and tomato slices with your inevitable hummus or baba ghanoush order. Don't waste time on the pita pizzas, they are glorified cheese crisps, which you can get (accompanied by a good, stiff margarita) at Fez. Ordering delivery from here feels like getting robbed by a grocer, the food is so simple. Good? Bad? Eh.  I do really love their stuffed grape leaves, but they are not the most popular dish (no one else I know likes them), so I would not try them unless you have a history of loving pickled/sour/savory things to your own painful detriment. Split tongue, etc.

As a former vegetarian/vegan, I've recently been discovering the (full, not substitutions or single-option style) menus of my favorite places. The vegetarian platter at this place is so good, though, that I really don't even have that desire. Okay, maybe I'm game for the chicken stew with a hard-boiled egg as an option, but come on. It's a stewed hard-boiled egg.  How could I not?   Misir wat, the red lentil stew, is by far the tastiest thing on the vegetarian menu, but the gomen and fosolia (greens and green beans, respectively), are also good, and completely different. Each dish is seasoned differently, so the platters offer flavors that really compliment each other (rather than blending). No garlic overload or trite use of the same spices over and over. The greens are definitely sporting some garlic, but the green beans are sweet and light. Everything is stewed here, but the variety of meats and vegetables allows that. Plus, I think I read somewhere it's traditional? : )  Salads are unimaginative, the vinaigrette is just that (but goes well with the bread, as vinaigrette tends to do), one tomato wedge per person rule seems to apply. I wish someone would ban iceberg from restaurants. Bread is amazing, spongy and sour. Soup is good, a bit salty, very thick and noodly. When low on cash, that plus one stew will do you ok. Beers are Ethiopian, as is the wine. I've tried both beers and the white wine they had, I favored the Harar beer with my meal.

Let me be clear: every single thing Mr. K said is correct. "Surly Auntie" owns the store with her brother, I believe. I still only get a half smile after years of patronage AND having lived with a former employee. But the food is good.  I like that the hummus comes with black olives, I like that it's a bit thicker than Pita Jungle's creamy concoction (available just up the street). I like the fried pakora. I like the yogurt-based pakora curry, though it tends to lose it's bearings on the buffet table. I like getting my own soda and napkins.   The thalis (combo platters) are affordable, not sure how the meat version is, but the veggie option is a good start if you miss the lunch buffet and are at a loss (after going to so many single-option vegetarian restaurants, it's quite easy to forget how to order). The briyani (spicy fried rice with veggies) is also delicious and served with tsatziki (I believe, which is a cucumber yogurt sauce). I clearly just like yogurt in this review... here's one: My father likes the dal. Ta-da!   Many options at or around five bucks, including lunch buffet (used to be 4 something, including drink, not too sure now).

I almost detracted a star based solely on my experiences working here in the summer as my first job, a couple years before they got that nice AC. The owner is sweet and keeps to herself, staff is nice, all have worked there for years now. Seriously, like 20.   It gets five stars because it is the closest thing to the feeling people must be describing when reminiscing about a candy shop that I have ever felt. And for staying the same. Those worn cardboard boxes have been there holding those patches, beads and other sew-ables as long as I can remember, and they always have the same ones, with a few additions here and there. The fabric revolves like crazy, but you can always find killer deals on pricey stuff like denim, velvet, or the embossed denim I got to make curtains, which has elements of both and was 5.99/yard. Poly cottons usually run about 2-3/yd, depending on the print. The walls are lined with rolls of binding, trim, and ribbon of all types. they have an entire isle of tassel trim. For Halloween, you can't go wrong.   Finding a lot of some fabrics can be difficult, and there is no guarantee they will have the same fabric again... in fact, it's almost guaranteed not to happen. Then again, you might just go in10 years from now to find the same roll of neon orange nylon mesh you remember tripping over.

I got my favorite aqua blue armchair, with original upholstey AND working (well, I might add) caster wheels for a screaming 25 dollars. I also got my first book of music there when I was learning to play as a kid, paid 25 cents andstill might be able to eek out the Mash theme song, the Star Wars Theme Song, I'd Do Anything for Love (but I won't do that).   I've never personally purchased clothing here. They have a soda machine, which I like in a thrift store. You just never know what's in there (besides religious music). Also a reportedly ok place to serve community service sentences, if you own a walkman!

An upscale mexican restaurant in the area seemed like the best thing to have happened to me. I planned my visit for a quieter evening, and reviewed the menu again and again.   However, upon our arrival I thought twice immediately. The parking was iffy, and the place didn't seem to stand up to the signage. Perhaps the art was not to my liking, honestly not a piece stands out in my memory.    We were seated immediately.   Our waiter seemed a little off, not to mention the fact that he was insanely snobby and seemed to be moonlighting in the kitchen, where he disappeared for 10-15 minutes at a time. He did not fill our soft drinks once without being first flagged down (those of you who have experienced the close quarters will understand how ridiculous this is).   Halfway through waiting for our food (which took 45 minutes, easily), the lamp above our table went out. We sat in the dark for a good 5 minutes before they even noticed. Which was actually a nice change of scenery from the boring beige walls.   When the food finally arrived, we were too tired (due to having finished an entire bottle of wine) so we left. Unfortunately, we took our grub with us. I had some sort of mixed seafood entree with chorizo and a creamy sauce. It's no coincidence you're taken aback by the combination... it didn't go down too easily. Having dropped 90 dollars on the meal, though, we felt compelled to finish as much as we could stand.   Normally I would make sure I got the name of the dish right, but since I am recommending that you not go there, why bother?

Two for one drinks on Halloween for dressing up like Lisa "left eye" Lopes (the "L" of TLC). I was happy, but it was dead. Fez is awesome for Happy Hour, as others have mentioned, I never really bother with the food... maybe I ought to.   The margaritas and a lot of other drinks come with interesting and tasty accents, like wedges of grapefruit and sour gummy worms. I am the type to always eat the salad on the plate, so the high-quality garnishes are appreciated.   I met yelper Kristin S. here last night, who took a photo of my friend (Sara B.) and I in our costumes. Hope it wasn't for sinister purposes! Ha!

My mother can't live without the soup-style beans, and she's right. I get the Clare burro, which has queso fresco, whole pinto beans, and avocado. I also usually get some guacamole, which is very chunky here, and add a bit of salt to eat with the chips.   It's a family place for me, I don't ever really like it as much when I try to take other people, and this is the second move I can remember. My folks are sticking by this one, and I am happy to tag along!

I spent a lot of time between classes here. I love the chai, and the food was just a bonus as I was sort of vacating the area... it seemed reasonable at the time. Vegan food is never cheap when it isn't just "accidentally vegan," if you know what I mean... ie vegan meaning a super simple or traditional food that meat lovers have reluctantly accepted as edible... sometimes. I had potato salad, which I hadn't had out in years, so I'd probably have paid anything. I think it's impressive they've found room to cook/prepare anything back there. It seems small. I never really go to a coffee shop when starving, though, so I guess I just view their offerings as little possible bonuses, not promises. That's not to say it wasn't good. It was pretty nice.

Clearly, some work could be done here. For instance, it is not currently possible for me to take the bus to work, due to the routes not covering the entire valley. Wait time is definitely an issue... even busy routes sometimes only have a bus every half hour, which is just ridiculous for planning. When I lived in Tempe, it wasn't quite as ridiculous, as the buses all went to a central "hub," and thus got me to school, work, and home, since most all were located downtown. Actually, that's not true... the bus was most useful to me when I lived in the southerly portions of the city or Mesa... the'burbs to downtown routes are quite organized and frequent. Anything else is a crapshoot in terms of convenience, or even the very existence of a reasonable route between your two locations.   It's fun to take the bus, but don't get caught behind one! Each stop typically seems take at least 1 or 2 minutes. Not enough people have metro cards, because they are (or at least were) ridiculous in price unless you ride the bus at least once each day. Then, you save a bit. Were the routes more, um, there, this would be reasonable. Anyway, this leads to lots of change counting and transfer giving. Transfers are also a crapshoot, but I think they are only supposed to last for an hour... Sometimes, you get lucky, though, and it's like an all-day pass to an amusement park.   Bus drivers are a different kind of animal. They are a diverse group: I've had some awesome, jolly ones (the black lady who sings while she drives, the guy that looks and acts like Santa Claus) and some disgruntled ones (the guy who stuck his head out the window and threatened to call 911 on someone who cut him off, then did, screaming into the phone in a thick accent, the guy with horn-rimmed glasses who wouldn't let me ride because I was a dime short, the guy who refused to help me figure out the bike rack, then honked at me as I fumbled with it, horn right near my face, of course). The people who ride the bus are just as interesting, depending on my mood I would get into some weird conversations (talking politics in spanish with drunk guys on the FLASH, swapping diy hair-cutting strategies with a pink-plumed art student, discussing veganism with a snobby Gentle Strength employee 'back in tha day,' being picked up on by all sorts of people). A book or walkman will grant you your solitude, if that is what you desire.   Writers should definitely ride the bus.

Run by the Mormons, they keep it really well stocked and organized. I got a couple of cool chairs there, a pair of fake leather cowboy boots, 3 belted pencil skirts, 4 or 5 pairs of chunky 80's earrings, a man's plaid shirt that fits me perfectly, countless other things. It is a thrift store, so there are the usual things that would take away from the experience, but the prices are reasonable and not fixed by item, like Goodwill. I've seen some really nice living room couches, sets, even, but never had a need. At one point, they had 40 or 50 framed prints of the same 5 paintings, one is a Van Gogh floral still life with a green background. I'd never seen it, my mom picked one up, though.   I am a masochist, so I love to peruse the "As-Is" and the yard where they keep a lot of bigger, crappier stuff.

Best deals, most human. Not a lot of talk or coddling with questions, but they take the time when you have a good one. Specializes in higher-end cars/performance stuff, but did a great job on my little sedan. Won't try to fix something halfway. I'm clearly no expert on cars, and I feel comfortable that they are not trying to rip me off, because I always walk out of there with the problem solved for less than worst-case $. Also does body work.

They service the entire valley, it's not just Tempe. They sent this really nice guy to fix the lock on my trunk. Not only did he have the right part on him, he did all the work fairly quickly and really didn't charge too much. He also gave me some tips on signs people are trying to steal your tires (like trying to break into your trunk). Decent people.

Based on these reviews, I scheduled my friend and I for the package mani/pedi deal they had going. They were unable to schedule us before 3:15, the next day, which was fine with me--I had said "any time." I think it's shady, however, that their special only lasts until 2:30 (which I found out after the services were rendered).   Until this point, I had a good time. They offered me iced tea (which was delicious), and my nail technician (she had a bit of an accent and was short) did a decent job. The place is gorgeous, really awesome lavendar mosaic tile throughout, very clean feel. My friend, however, was left with hangnails and polish on her skin/cuticle. It was almost as if I had tried to do it... only worse! She was really steamed, and I have to agree. If there isn't a standard in place, I really cannot frequent it at 60 bucks a shot.   Merchandise up front was waaaaay overpriced, almost as if it came from Electricladyland (don't waste your time) in the same plaza... huh.

I'm disappointed at the loss of lesbo vibe, but the new vibe is more cheerful. Drink specials are sweet. I prefer to come here alone, but maybe I should just stop bringing straight people. The bartender is funny, which is rare these days.

When I lived in the area, I loved getting an eggplant and artichoke-heart pie delivered, eating it slowly over the weekend. Pasta is so-so, lunch special is outrageous!  Website is difficult to navigate, doesn't seem complete (at least they have a website, I guess)... No delivery area visible, and the staff simply responds with "Where are you located?" and "No," if you ask where they DO deliver. Apparently, they don't deliver to my new house, which seems really ridiculous, erm,  for geographical reasons... I guess it isn't a big surprise; they are only one (or two?) store(s).
