Went here to meet a friend for lunch. Did not like the food at all. Their pasta was very dry (yes even with the sauce). Flavor was very disappointing.

Children 3 and under are free. Adults pay 7 dollars as of jun 2015. Pro: visitors get to climb aboard a fire truck. They also get to hear live calls for firemen in phoenix and see different models of fire trucks in history.  Con: The place is small, mostly exhibits so smaller kids might get bored easily. There is a small play area for children but it was dirty and not a lot to do. Lastly, while there is a baby changer in the bathroom, it is placed high. Im 5 feet and it was my on level with my neck.

Outstanding customer service. Bathroom on back available and clean. Unfortunately, aside from the jam food was unimpressive.

Inexpensive but the place is small. Not a lot to see and do. Cafe is also under construction.

Very upset about the service. Hard to reach on the phone to schedule an appointment. Finally after able to reach via the phone, was able to schedule service for car detail. Paid 150 for equinox chevy car detail. Picked up the next day and the car smells horrible. Could see crumbs and stain still on the seat and metal hooks.   Update: it took a while but after getting through, spoke with scott davis manager. Was asked to bring car again for a checkup. Initially noone believed me and attempted to charge me for odor eliminator. Told them no and reclean it. 3 hours later, they apologized said they found food underneath the seats that they missed. The food was from the one i spilled and reason i did the detailing in the first place which i told austin my service manager at the beginning. -__-

The good: the view is good, allowing you to see 360 degrees view of downtown phoenix. Customer service is not bad either. Server was able to accommodate our request to split an order without paying additional fees.  The bad: I have tasted better food especially with their prices. Not to mention, their servings are also small. While view might also be good, the place constantly moving can be dizzying especially on your first time.

Come here for filipino deserts. Brazo de mercedes, chocolate mouse and hot pandesal to name a few. They do offer plated meals but a little bit on the expensive side. Tip: try their breakfast rice entrees.

Small bakery but with good selection of filipino pastries/delicacies. Most importantly, they are very cheap. I.e. 6 small rolls with filling cost 2 dollars or so.    Tip try the pimiento and spanish bread. They also make toasted siopao or bun.  Con: cash only

Great place to bring toddlers and walking kids. There is a designated are for smaller crawling kids but with admission pricing would not recommend it. Place is always kept clean. Sometimes they also hosts events that are educational and give out freebies for the kids. I.e. My niece got free toothbrushes for one event.   Con:  Admission pricing can add up. Food in the cafe are also very expensive and not much variety; however, you can bring your own snacks as long as you eat it at the cafeteria. Place can also be very busy on the weekends.

Go here for sushi! Love love it! Have been to japan and back and I would say sushi here is the closest I have tasted so far in terms of taste. Really authentic. For much bigger groups, you can also rent a more private enclosure for more privacy.   Con: It is a small diner so it can fill out fast especially on weekends. Also will not recommend their combo plates aside from their sushi. Prices can also add up which is why would recommend going during their happy hour.

Was not impressed. Place was 80% empty. No bathrooms. Most importantly, there was little flavor in the cake and eclair we had. Tasted better french inspired pastries in phoenix. Pro: the presentation of the pastry was nice and the place was relatively clean but that was it.

Went here with friends for a show. Line was long. We got a deal on ticket pricing which was great; however, when we got seated was told you have to spend a minimum amount of money to stay. For this, we bought drinks and snacks which was expensive and not tasty at all. Aside from this, the artist/performer himself was great! Would only recommend this place if you really like the artist!

Would recommend for smaller kids. Toddlers and those under 8/10. There are two main areas to choose from.   Turn right from the entrance and you get a more active/social hands on play area where kids can play with inflatable toys, etc. with other kids, staff have story book read outs, some puppet show area and a small classroom art class for them. This area I believe is designed more to encourage social interaction between the children. Make note though that the activities are only done on certain days and times so ask before going.  Turn left and you get a place for activities where kids can sit down and make their own art and/or view and play with children approved technologies individually. The good thing is that they can bring their artwork home. In addition, on some dates they also host special exhibits on this side. Sadly, when we went here the last two times there was none.   The place does not have a cafe. However, they do allow you to bring your own foods to eat in a designated area containing a vending machine.   Adults are required to pay admission fee in addition to 1 year olds. But ticket was much cheaper than phoenix children's museum especially if you opt to buy the yearly membership.

Pro: Place is clean. It is also one of the few places in phoenix that offers crepes.  Con: Service was really slow and disorganized. Waited 15 minutes for my order only to find that they misplaced it. A couple of orders sat on the counter without calling out for who it was from.  There is only 6 kinds of crepe to choose from. Size was small for a 5 dollar crepe. Chipotle flavor was good. Nutella....was disappointing....

Been to the other angry crab location in phoenix multiple times and compare to that, this place has better customer service. Bathrooms are also spacious and clean.  Definitely come here if you like seafood by the pound. Trifecta mussels as well as cooked oysters...yes please. Would not recommend  the meat barbecue though.

Customer service started good. Then my niece spilled her water and they did not bother to clean the floor up so we sat with a puddle of water. The trash bucket for the table even already overflowing was not emptied once. Afterwards, saw how they cleaned the tables..... handled the trash and went to give the check to us without washing their hands... did not even bother cleaning the table before putting a new tablecloth in...and this place does not have any plates so u have to eat on top of the tablecloth itself...  Food was also very bland... no taste except for the mozerella sticks. Ordered sweetpotato fries which they gave to us burnt....   One word about this place...run!
