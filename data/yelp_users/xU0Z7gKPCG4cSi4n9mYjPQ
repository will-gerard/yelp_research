Great place for some great Mexican food. I have been to both this location as well as the one in mesa and both are great. The food is great and the happy hour options are endless. I love eating outside the few times a year we can and they have a great area. TV's misteres, and heaters. Great for all year round.

Very dirty!!!!  As soon as you walk in to this place you are hit with a terrible smell. You can tell that it is older so there is only so much that can be done. The laser tag itself was pretty decent but everything else wasnt great. The arcade is small and the food is terrible. Bathrooms were clean enough for me to use but all around not an impressive place.

I dont make it up to this chili's very often, nor have I been to one in a while. They have a new set of margarits that were great!! I wish they would bring back the buffalo sliders, but the regular sandwich is just as tasty!

Sampler platter is worth every penny!!   Love OTB. I have always had great food and great servce. This evening they were out of a specific item on my platter so they replaced it with something else and offered to give me more of anything else on the plate. I thought that was nice of them because its not always the servers fault the kitchen is out of food.

Such a great little spot. You not only can look out the windows and watch planes, commercial, private, and even some time old planes and military jets. The food is great as well as the service. I work in walking distance from the cafe and love to come walk over for breakfast and lunch.

Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!  I was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct.

I don't care for flying but it's way better then a 10 hour drive!!    US Airways has never disappointed me in a flight. They have always been on time for me, never lost my luggage and are efficiant in the work they do. The flight attentends have always been kind and helpful. If I have the choice I will always chose US Airways.

Went to the hotel for a seminar. The hotel seemed pretty nice, I only visited the lobby and a conference room. The conference room was set up great, they had clean glasses and water set up on every table. They seemed to accommodate the conference group very well. If my company were to ever have a conference I would suggest this hotel.

The location is great. The service.... not so much. My sister and I went on a weekday night and it was not busy at all. We ordered our drinks and then our food. We had two other people meeting us there but did not tell them because we wanted to eat right away. Once the other two showed up (guys) she was back to our table to help. She was very attentive with them and they even got their food before we did. I never got a refill on my tea and my one of the guys never got the drink he actually ordered. She ordered a vodka and cran and she brought him out a beer. She apologized and offered it to him on her and she would go grab his drink.... she never did. My sister ordered a queso dip and asked for more chips.... the chips never came until we asked another server. The food was good the location is nice the seating is great but the service isn't tremendious. I would go back, just hopefully get a different server.

This was my second trip to Ruth's Chris. I absolutely love coming here it is always a great experience.   First the ambiance; The restaurant is very beautiful and clean :) You walk into a hostess area where they great you and refer to you by last name. They are quick and efficient. The tables have table clothes and cloth napkins. The bathrooms are in tip top shape as well, with a full length mirror to adjust your nice clothes you are asked to wear.  The service; We were seated by a hostess who immediately noticed my date and I were wearing black. When were seated she replaced our white napkins with black ones so we did not have lint on our clothes. I thought that was the most generous thing. It seems small but it was awesome that they even thought of something like that. They cleared off the other two settings and we were brought out bread and water. Our waiter was kind and efficient. I ordered iced tea and I use sweet n low in it. The cup of sweeteners was low on sweet n low but I only use 1 per glass so I was not ready to ask for more. When he brought me a refill, in a new glass not filled at my table, he replaced the sweetener bowl with another full of sweet n low. I didn't even have to ask for more he had already noticed. The attention to detail was so impressive.   The food; The food is outstanding. I ordered the stuffed chicken on both of m visits and I like to refer to it as "chicken stuffed full of heaven". The dishes come out nice and hot as well as separate sides. If you want to share a side it is completely possible, they bring you out a boat of mashed potato's!! I try not to eat too much bread and salad because I want to eat my entire main course :) My date had a steak which was delicious as well. It was cooked perfectly and was nice and warm the entire meal.  The price; You will notice that this is not a cheap restaurant. The experience and the food is worth every penny. I am a strong believer that if you are paying a high price the food and the service should be impeccable, and it was.   I love coming to Ruth's Chris. The price is a little high so I do not get to endulge as much as I would like but I make it worth it each time I am able to go!!

First time here and this is not where you want to be in the middle of summer in Arizona. Holy cow is it hot. We opted to wait for inside seating instead of being seated right away outside. That is pointless because it is just as hot inside as it is outside.  I ordered the chicken tenders and my boyfriend had the French dip. We kept it simple. Both were fantastic. Needless to say the food is great. He enjoyed his beer as well as I ordered from the regular bar. Our waitress was polite and on top of everything. She apologized for "the wait" when we were really only waiting a few minutes for a table on a Saturday night.   Good place to come for local beer and to support local restaurants.

TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Only reason they got 1 star is because I cant go lower....  My sister and I came to the Tempe improv for the first time sense its remodel. We came to see Ralphie May on a Wednesday night. The whole area was packed full of guest. We chose to sit on the end of the half booth half table. Many servers would come by and ask if we had more in our party so they could sit another couple in the seats, we did not, however every time they would put a couple in those seats the server would suggest they move because it was right in the walk way and people would be stepping on them the while time, or the people would ask to be moved because of the same reason. Right before the show began we had a couple that sat in front of us, only because they were the last seats available. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time, it took the server a bit to come over but we were fine just hanging out. Once we ordered, after he tried up-selling absolutely everything, we waited, and waited, and waited. We watched three tables who ordered after us get their food and drinks before we even got our drinks. The manager must have noticed my frustration written all over my face because he came over and asked if we had ordered. I said "yes we did, about a half hour ago". He apologized and we had our drinks about 10 minutes later. During the waiting of our food a server with a full tray of beverages spilled them all on the couple behind us. The customers were good sports and let it go. The ice tea my sister ordered tasted absolutely terrible, however it didn't much matter because I spilled it on her anyway. We tried maintaining the mess while servers walked by and and saw the mess yet did nothing. I finally got up and interrupted a server entering items into a register and said we have had a spill I need napkins. She didn't even look at me and said their are napkins right there. They were the small cocktail napkins your drink goes on..... so i took the whole stack, that got her attention! We cleaned up the mess ourselves and still waited on our food. The HORRIBLE food finally came out, and then the lights shut off for the show to start. I would say it is very difficult to eat in the dark but after a few bites I was done. The show started late so it went into the evening later then planned. I have heard Ralphie doesn't always stop when he is supposed to (which can be great) but it was time for us to get out of there. We asked our server for our check and he said he couldn't check us out in there that we had to step into the lobby area. It didn't make any sense but walked away without more explanation. I tried to explain to my sister what he said but she was just as confused as I. We went ahead and got up and went into the lobby, where there was not where for us to pay at all. The server finally came out and asked where we were going, I told him I said we needed our check so we could leave. He brought us the check, wrong, over $35 of the bill was not ours. I gave him my card and it took him forever but luckily got it fixed and as far as I know didn't charge me incorrect. By far this has been the worst experience I have had at the Tempe improv. May the remodle wasnt the best idea.....

Ikea is great, but be prepared to spend some moeny. You will spend some money not becuase items are expensive but becuase you find so many things that are a must have! Like most my biggest complaint is the amount of time it takes to put all this darn furniture together, it is in sooooo many peices. Good news is you can have is essembled and brought to you.

Love the deep dish, love the thin crust, love the dessert. Cannot go wrong!!! It's always busy because they are always packed because it's so good. They also take time to prepare the pizza, the deep dish at least 20 minutes but worth it. I have nothing bad to say even the service is lovely :)

Well..... Don't ask for pot stickers when they don't have any because they will be red about it when you ask. Oh and if your debit card doesn't run through because you use it too much and it's a little worn b prepared to have cash because they won't even try to type your number in.

You must get the loaded bake potatoes soup. Best I've ever had!!  Black Angus is one of my favorite restaurants. They only have a few in Arizona so I take every chance I get to eat there. The appetizers, drinks, and entrees are great. The service at this specific Black Angus was also superb. Very friendly and quick. We were there for lunch so I believe he understood we had a time limit. The booths are nice and big so it is a great place for a big party.

I do love Village Inn!!!   We go to village inn on a regular basis because it is one of the few breakfast places around. I was always a fan of Ihop because of the pancakes but Village Inn is much better. You don't have to order a side of anything because most of the meals already come with it, (side of hash browns with your omelet at Ihop does not exist unless you pay for it!). They also have great pie!! I love the chocolate truffle, it is a seasonal pie so I tend to buy a whole one and freeze it but when it is there it is a must have. The staff is friendly and good at what they do. The restaurant is always clean as well as the bathrooms. I feel village Inn's are underrated these days, and I may be old in spirit so that is where my joy of village in comes in, but in the end it is great. :)

First time I have ever eaten at Joes Farm Grill  I have eaten at Joe's BBQ, which has great food so I was expecting the same...... Well I got better. We had breakfast and it was delecious. By far the best bacon I have ever had. I got a waffle as well and it was so fluffy and tasty. I have yet to try the lunch and dinner menu but the breakfast will keep me coming back. Outdoor seating is nice and if its to warm inside is avaliable as well :)

Going during happy hour and take advantage of their appetizers. We ordered the quesadilla, tacos, and nachos and all of them were fantastic and much cheaper then the rest of the menu. We also took advantage of the outside seating which was great because we love to people watch and their are many walking around the mall.

This was our first time at this wine bar. We were celebrating my moms birthday with a girls night out. The server was great at helping us pick a wine for the table as well as with the food. We are all pretty picky about food, we like simple, and they had some simple with a twist of, "what in the world is that'. I'm sure most people know but like I said, we like simple :) I did not care for my meal so I was eating off my sisters plate, our server noticed and apologized right away and asked if I wanted something else. I explained that it was no big deal, its my taste buds and that I was fine. She insisted that I at least get a dessert, and hey who can pass up dessert. The cheesecake was AMAZING!! The bartender was also really great. He found out it was my moms birthday and insisted we have shots on him. We bought a few bottles of wine and in my opinion tipped well. We were very satisfied with our experience and will defiantly return!

Don't sit at the bar...... No one helps you.  This is by far the worst service I have ever had. I love Grimaldi's the pizza is great but the service was just terrible. Up front stand three hostess' that cannot figure out how long the wait was. Each one of them said a different time, and were extremly rude. One finally said the bar was open seating so for the first time we sat at the bar. I noticed a huge party leave from the patio so I asked a hostess if the patio is open seating, it was not so I then asked if the wait was still as long. She informed me that people were ahead of me (which was understandable) however no one was waiting. So I went back to the bar and said its fine we will just deal with it. Some better spots outside opened up so we moved seats from in the bar to the outside bar area. I watched two tables stay open the entire time of our meal, which was 2 hours long. I was ready to leave had I been able to tell the waitress to cancel our order. The reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is becuase in the end the amazing pizza made up for the terrible service. I love the pizza and next time I think mabey I will order it to go.

They now have a limited bar which is a little disappointing. I'm not a huge beer or wine drinker so that's not exciting for me. They do have a few special drinks that involve wine but that's about it. Hey the seasonal strawberry cheesecake was good.

So I ordered the Nathan sliders as an appetizer. The menu specifically states that you get 6 mini hotdogs with your choice of topping. It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... "Actually it wasn't even that good" was my answer. So more importantly don't eat here because the food is basically terrible.

I don't get to visit the Mesa location often but it has been worth it each time I go. The food is still just as good along with the service. We came in for lunch on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy at all. The server was very helpful and attentive. Love Garcias one of the best Mexican food places for Fajitas, hands down!

We sat out on the patio this time around and it took about 20 minutes just for them to come and serve us. Once they finally did we got drinks and waited another 10 minutes for the drinks to come and for us to order food. Our drinks were constantly empty and they were out of some of their food. I normally like coming here but this time around wasnt a great expereince.

I love the nachos!!! I came in to get the nachos that are so delicious and was upset with what they turned out to be. I normally order them with steak, they were out, and everything else on it. The person helping me was using very small portions. I had to ask him for more of almost everything as he was loading them up. I am not selfish with the portions I would just like them to at least cover the top portion of my nachos. I ended up having to take them out of the container they were in and mix them up myself. I got to where I needed to pay and the girl didn't seem to know what in the world she was doing. I had to tell her twice what I got and she still rang it in wrong. I will go back with hopefully a better experience.   Just a note..... Rubber gloves are supposed to help with cleanliness, when you are touching everything with your gloves, what is the point in wearing them.

It has been awhile since I have been here. This visit has be horrible. Not only was I watching the terrible service while standing in line for all 4 customers in front of me but then I watched them have to come out and kill a spider. She did not changer her gloves after that (she didn't use her hands but common). We left after the spider incident and once I saw the station of food and how disgusting it was I was glad I didn't let the spider influence me the wrong way.

Love Garcias.....   I love going to Garcias. It is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Arizona. They have great fajitas and a fantastic happy hour. The bean dip has slipped some, it used to be much tastier but it is still pretty good. Great margaritas and normally great service. The outside seating is also very nice. I would recommend Garcia's to anyone who wants good Mexican food!   Update....  We just recently celebrated my sisters 30th birthday here. We came out for happy hour so we were able to deal with the whole family being there :) We requested outside patio because it was such a large group and we were interested in the happy hour. We had grandparents that "couldn't handle the heat" so they allowed us to eat inside and still get happy hour prices. The server and the manager were very attentive to all 21 needs that we had in attendance. They did such a fantastic job dealing with so many people and made the experience great. No ones food was sent back it was all correct and everyone enjoyed themselves.

Q337sJLaPPiKCsoIoSEWGg
I normally am a huge fan of Red Robin and have never been disappointed until this evening. As usual I order the clucks and fries, buffalo style.  When I order the clucks I ask for an extra plate so I can cut into them instead of trying to cut them in the basket and cutting up the paper. When I cut into the clucks this evening I noticed the chicken was extremely undercooked and by this time I had already taken my first bite. It was very pink in the middle and made me immediately stop eating. The server came back to the table and we explained what was going on, she offered to cook a whole new set. I went through the rest of the chicken to see if it was necessary and 3 out of the 4 pieces were all undercooked. I immediately gave her the entire basket back because I didn't want anything more to do with the food in it. She was nice enough to bring me out a new meal and comp me for the clucks but by then my entire table had already finished their food and had to then wait on me to eat my entire meal. I was nervous eating this basket but all seemed to be ok this time around. I appreciate the new basket and giving me my meal for free but undercooked chicken makes me very nervous. I not only will probably never order that meal again but may also avoid the restaurant all together.

Great spot for a theater.   The mall itself is starting to slip, the stores by the theater are empty or going to close soon. The theater itself is great. Its starting to get older so the seats are starting to get crusty but still one of the cleanest Harkins I've been too. I love that the theaters are big and the staff is always helpful. I've never had a problem at this Harkins and I will continue to go to it. Great experience.

This was my first visit to this nursery. We bought a few plants and a tree. The employees were very helpful and kind. They have a large selection of items for you to choose from. Our plants and tree are doing great because of the quality they have. I was hoping for some more plants to add some color to my backyard but the choices were limited, however I do beleive that is becuase of the season and the State :) Great place to shop to spruce up your yard!!

Ask for Maddy, she will take care of you! She does such a great job.  This was my first time visiting this salon. I came here because I followed my stylist from her old location to this one. The first thing that struck me as awesome was how the salon was set up. It's very fancy and I was exited to be there. They have multiple things you can come in for more than just hair and have a large variety of products not just what the hair chain wants you to sell.  It was very clean and has TVs in many places so you can watch tv while getting your hair done. I will not only be back because my stylist works there but I will be back because I love the location (in Dana park) as well as the salon itself. Great place!

My boyfriend and I tend to meet work friends here pretty often. Its quiet so that's why we like to go. It never seems to be too busy. The food is typical bar food, nothing really stands out but it is edible. The service is good if you are in the actual bar area, if you sit in the "outskirts" the seem to sometimes forget about you. We did have to wait quit awhile for our check.

This Olive Garden has always been great. They are quick and always get my meal right. I have had water spilled on me, a rude server, and an extended wait time, but in the end I still think they are great. I went last night for dinner with my boyfriend and my dad. We were there during the dinner rush but the wait was only 15 minutes. We sat by the bar already knowing they have open seating we were still going to wait anyway incase someone else wanted the table. The bus boy instisted we take it, he cleared the table quickly and sat us down. We had great service and they didnt mind they we stayed and chatted even after we had already paid.

Where do I begin....It took a few minutes for us to get a server, no big deal, and once she arrived we were completely ready to go. We frequent Olive Garden so our decision making is very minimal. Once she got there we placed our drink and food order. Normally drinks come out right away, but not this time. We first received our salad before our drinks even came out. I had to request that we get our drinks as well as some croutons for our salad, for there were none in the bowl. The bowl barley had any salad in it and no cheese was offered to top the salad. Even if we did receive cheese and croutons I am unsure it would have masked the taste of the warm and wilty lettuce that filled the smallest portion of the bowl. She came back with our drinks and whole salad instead of just croutons, this lettuce was just as bad and still no cheese was offered. Once we finally got our drinks I noticed I had lemon in my ice tea, it happens often but still it was one more thing that was wrong.   We ordered lunch portions of the chicken Alfredo, not for the price but for the actual size. The meals came out and looked larger than the lunch but smaller then the dinner so I couldn't quite tell what we received. Not that this is a big deal but I feel it is worth mentioning just because of everything else, normally the pasta comes with a soup spoon to help scoop your noodles, I had to ask for the spoon but it took so long I just gave up and started eating before my food got cold. Luckily the food was delicious, and that is the only reason that I am even rating one star. As expected in this terrible experience getting a drink refill was a nightmare. We were refilled once after our dinners were already gone, and the drinks had been empty since the end of the salad.    I went ahead and had my credit card prepared for her to come and drop off our check so I could speed up the process..... It didn't. I tried handing her my card and she said she would be right back, she wasn't. I finally stopped another server and asked them to ring it in, I handed them my card and they said they would take care of it. We waited forever and our server finally came back, empty handed, asking if we need anything else. I responded with "my card would be great so we can go." After trying to find it we finally got it back so we could leave. Of course when I finally saw the bill for the first time, after my card had already been run because I was becoming so impatient, I then noticed they charged us for the dinner portions of the Alfredo. I guess it was the dinner after all.... I signed it got up and left, I was not about to wait even longer for them to figure out how to adjust my bill and adjust the charge already made to my card. My own fault for paying before looking I suppose.   The table next to us was having many problems as well, they had to keep pulling her over and asking for different things, but I will let them yelp about their own experience.    Hands down the worst experience at an Olive Garden I have ever had. Ever worse then the time they spilled and entire glass of water on me.

Pork dumplings pan fried. You won't regret it.   We have come to this P.F. Changs a few times and the food is normally great. This specific time we came it was all terrible. We were seated right away which was great but the server seemed kinda out of it. He kept forgetting what we ordered and sat down in the booth while taking our order. The food wasnt very good at all, I was very disapointed in this expereince. I will probably continue to eat at P.F changs but maybe another location.

DO NOT EAT OUTSIDE!!!! You will be ignored and have to wait forever for anything!   This was our first trip to EggsTc. We went into the small restaurant and were immediately greeted by a walking hostess that said sit wherever you want and then walked on. We decided to take advantage of the few times a year we can sit outside so chose the patio. We waited about 15 minutes, while other tables were being served before someone came out and finally said, " Have you been helped yet?" Obviously we hadn't because of the lack of menus and drinks. She brought us menus took our drink order and then never returned. We got our drinks, don't waste your money just ask for water. The ice tea was terrible and ice less and my boyfriends diet soda was flat and tasteless. We then proceeded to wait even longer for our food and once brought out was given to the wrong table. They corrected the mistake and brought it to us where I immediatly was unimpressed. The hash browns were overcooked, and spread out as thin as possible to fill the plate. I got a breakfast sandwich that tasted fine, defiantly something I could make myself. My boyfriend got the burrito that was defiantly large but mostly full of smashed potatoes that did not taste very good at all. They came and cleared out plates and we asked for our check. We waited 20 minutes until my boyfriend decided to go inside and ask for it and try and pay in there. She noticed him as soon as he walked in and said she was still look for the check. She asked two other servers, both with rude remarks of "No's" as he proceeded to wait. Once the check was paid he wrote on the back of the receipt his concerns and we were finally able to leave.    Long story short...... We will not be returning and I do not recommend it.

Beautiful Hotel!!!!  This was the first time I have ever been to this hotel and it was amazing just walking in. I came here for a conference so I cannot comment on the rooms or even the hotel staff. We dealt mostly with the company putting on the conference. The lunch provided was great as well as sectioning us off from the guest checking into the hotel.

I love Jimmy Johns!!! It is one of my favorite sandwich places. Scratch that, it is my only favorite sandwich place. They are delecious! The staff of course is always very fast, if you are new to Jummy Johns prepare for a little anxiety when ordering lol.

I got a full car wash with mats, floors, and seats being shampooed. It took them over three hours to get my car cleaned (I have a messy dog who loves to get his hair everywhere). They did such a great job with it. Almost all the hair was gone, I wasnt expecting it to be that clean. Dog hair is almost impossible to get off of seats. I was impressed and thankful for all the work they put in to my car.

Thrown together and shoved in a bag....  I came in during the dinner rush and they were a little busy. The people behind the counter were kind but rushing me. I ordered my sandwich and had to ask the young lady multiple times what she was saying becuase she was not speaking clearly. She threw the mess of a sandwich together cut it no where near in half, rolled it up and shoved it in the bag. As I was waiting I noticed the gloves they were wearing, in my opinion are pointless. They touch everything with the gloves on, the microwave, the trays ect. I also watched one person swipe the extra tuna back into the tub then go on to make a sandwich for someone else. Sure hope they like a side of tune with the meatball sub they ordered. All in all it is a subway and I will come back and hope for better service next time.

Love QuickTrip!!!!   If you want to get gas go to QT, you want a snack, go to QT, you want a clean bathroom..... Go to QT! If it is possible for me to get to a quick trip over any other gas station I will take it. QT is always my first choice. I am amazed at how clean eveything is all the time. I appreciate how well they take care of the stores.

This Jimmy Johns is a little newer so I am gonna assume that is why they are not as fast. In the end the sandwich is still amazing and I love it. Club Lulu all the way. Don't get distrot about them having you order quickly, as soon as you get the system down you are thankful for such fast service because you don't want to wait forever for the deliciousness that it is!!!

Jolene is amazing. My English bulldog loves her. I have her come every other week because she does such a great job. Every time she comes she doesn't even have to take him into the van he just goes running and jumps in. She does such a great job and gets him so much cleaner then I ever could. He used to come back from petsmarts grooming terrified so it is well worth it. Book in advance like I do and you will be completely set. She notifies us the night before she comes and lets us now after the bath how it went. Worth every penny :)

First off let me start by saying I love, love, love Jimmy Johns......   This location is new but I am not sure that makes up for the mistakes. I work near this Jimmy Johns so I frequent it quite a bit. My boss sent me on this specific trip for lunch for him and myself. My usual is the number 16 Club Lulu no tomatoes (cant stand the taste of tomatoes). He text messaged me his order, Club with no onions. For those of you who are frequent Jimmy Johns goers you will know that half the menu is in fact multiple types of clubs. He has eaten at Jimmy Johns before so I assumed it was a club that had onions on it because he was specific about NO ONIONS! I gave them my order first because I knew it by heart and they began working on it while I discussed with the register man which club to get for my boss. He "thinks" the number 9 is the only one that automatically comes with onions so I went with that one. I explained my story how he didn't want onions so that has to be it. My sandwich was done before I even paid. I searched for my bosses sandwich because I went and grabbed drinks while the number 9 was being made. The guy making the sandwiches handed me two and I said no I have mine I just needed the number 9. He handed me someones number 10..... after the confusion and the proper sandwich I left with my subs. I returned to the office to find tomatoes on mine (even when you pick them off the taste is still there) and onions on his (even when you pick them off the taste and the SMELL is still there). We were both very unsatisfied with our sandwiches and now my boss will not be asking me to make the lunch run anymore. Fast is great but maybe waiting to listen what the custromer wants is better.

Oh how I wish I could give more. I love tropical smoothie but I may have to rethink this location. I walked into the store and only one other customer was there. They were having some sort of malfunction with the registrar so thy were writing orders down by hand, no big deal. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with no tomatoes (yum!) I sat done at a table unable to pay and waited to see what the process would be. One worker was on the phone trying to fix the phone while another made the smoothies and the third just trolled around unsure what to do. The unsure one brought me my smoothie and some post it notes where he asked for my card to write down the number. I was not super keen on the idea but understood they need my money some way another. He wrote down all my info and then they got the machines working. He began to ring up my order which came out to double them amount, thank goodness I didn't end up blind sided by the charge later. I explained to him how the meals work and he then lowered the price. I asked for the paper with my card back, just to be safe. After all that I got my wrap where he just then realized he put tomatoes on it because he " forgot to read the note". Unfortunately for his excuse it was lousy considering he was the one that took the note. I said it was ok and wanted to be on my way because I was real ready to go by then. All in all I think it's best if these workers have some sort of management around.   Update, just got home to eat my food and it taste terrible. And not just because of the tomatoes!

They just recently open up two locations near me and they are always very busy with the excitement of the new food. Don't let the lines worry you they move pretty quick. They have a lovely assortment of treats as well as sandwiches, soups, and breads. I had the tuna, it was not to my particular liking but I tried a little of everyone else's soups and sandwiches and all were very tasty. The menu is large with many options to chose from so grab a menu while standing in line to help with your decisions. You can also call ahead or use the drive thru :)

First time here. Came with 3 co-workers and everyone including me loved the food. Fraser salads, chicken bacon ranch, and a Philly cheesesteak all got great reviews. Friendly staff and great location.

I have been here twice now and it has been so much fun. It's always pretty busy but they have plenty for you to do while you are waiting. The food is delicious so if you are going to wait awhile defiantly eat. It is pricey I wish they charged per game instead of time limits, especially if you are going with guys who like to take practice swings.

Got invited to see a early screening of the movie Planes. Its a great theater they had everything set up really well for the screening. The theater like many other Harkins are clean and have great customer service. I prefer Harkins over any other movie theaters.
