RUN! Don't walk from this dr....I begged for a super thyroid panel and was refused every time. I was told my T3s were fine and didn't need to be tested. That I needed to just stop eating and exercise. I dumped Rudgear for a real dr. Who actually listens and lost over 50 pounds, reduced my meds and have never felt better. I wish I could rate them -10.

My husband and I visited because we have never eaten Vietnamese food before. The staff was amazing! We met the chef, had Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls, everything was delicious and fresh. We will definitely be back!
