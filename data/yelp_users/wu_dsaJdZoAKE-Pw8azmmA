Went to Ling & Louie's with a friend for dinner tonight to discuss upcoming photoshoots and design work.  We walked in and were greeted by the bartender, and then we waited to be seated for what seemed like forever.  Finally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us. I have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.  I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out. Once we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not. We ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce. I ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing!  I was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert. If It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star.  Not sure I would return unless it were just to hang out at the bar and only to be served by the sweet bartender.

I was greeted nicely as I walked in. Shop looked kinda rundown and outdated. The receptionist had me wait while she went next store to gather staff. I was greeted by my stylist who had foil pieces in her hair. She was nice and gave me a nice haircut.  The rest of the staff was off key and gave off a rude feeling. Making the experience uncomfortable. They mentioned the owner in conversation and how she wasn't even there. As my haircut was finished I walked towards the front desk. While waiting to be rung up, it took three employees to figure out the register. I was asked if I wanted to add a tip on my debit card which I replied yes, I said the amount and they made me repeat myself two more times as if she was in disbelief. How rude I thought. She handed me my card back, I said thank you. I said bye to the stylist and she gave me her card, when one of the other stylist says thank you while looking down in a rude tone as if thats something they are programmed to say. Overall my stylist was great but with the rude unsettling feeling in the environment will make me think twice before visiting again.
