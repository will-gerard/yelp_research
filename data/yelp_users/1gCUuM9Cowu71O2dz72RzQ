Ok.so first visual impression was a regular drop joint hopefully with a good underlining" food".I got there mix plate#2 with beef and chicken katsu w rice and macaroni salad.the chicken tasted like boneless fried chicken cutlets w a side of Louisiana style bbq sauce" instead of katsu sauce,not good,the beef was borderline beef jerky, thinly sliced over sauced beef,some of it was tender,alot of burnt ends and grisly bites,with a copious amount of marinate.left a coating in my mouth,the rice was sticky and clumped apart,the macaroni salad wasn't bad but wasn't good,had to add pepper and there were chunks of russet patotos in it,that was first,and I really wanted the lau lau,but only on Saturdays.as well as kalua beef.I will go back to try the lau lau but not anytime soon.stay classy yelpers

At first glance when I walked in I liked the atmosphere,classic dinner style,the servers were friendly,the owner im assuming was not to say the least,sloppy appearance,just looked down at me,didn't say a word,from what I could see he did nothing but get in the way of the workers and pull the boss card.I had a good laugh at this while I waited on my orders of there classic money island dogs.here goes.the dog itself was Vienna,woopie.they were not that big in size,they were all burnt to a crisp.but tried to disguise that with there chili and onions and cheese and sauce.the chili was ok.so not good,seemed like it was a canned product with a twist"spices".I wont go back for the hotdogs,but I will try it once more for there breakfast,id rather go to teds hotdogs.so stayed tuned yelpers

I go to that area alot and I figured I would stop in and see what they had for dress clothes,vest/slacks/ties,etc,being that it is in Scottsdale I assumed"my fault"that where it is located that there would be some quality mercy in there,wrong,I have better stuff in my older brothers closets.and he's an h&m type of guy closets.fyi.save yourself a trip and hit up the goodwill just south of them,stay classy yelpers

I took my my friends there for lunch this afternoon,the staff was friendly and helpful,and not overly helpful.I had spinach mango chicken salad and it was perfect,glazed almonds,there wine selection wasn't big but it was good,a bit costly per glass,my friends had the french dips and not only were they big but there were tasty.good meat.nice fresh bread,nice patio to enjoy people watching,can't wait to have dinner there

DO NOT GOT THERE.worst customer service ever.i was reffered there by my mechanic.i have a high end classic car and was a bit nervous at first but mark one of the service desk employees made me feel a little bit better.not much,so i dropped the car off later.a full day later i had to go down there to open the hood because they could not figure out how.then the owner calls me."if you want to call him that"real peice of work that guy is.and explains he wants to meet me and chat and get to know me before they work on my car after i already dropped it off and signed the papers.weird.then he explains its a pewrsonal issue becuase i hurt his techs ego,so i need to make ir right.i said im not comfartable with that and do not have time,and just need my car fixed.then he says "we dont have time to dick with your car" so i went and picked it up.please do yourself a favor and go else where.the owner should work at in junk yard with that attitude.or wine and dine them to get anything done.negative 10 stars,stay away yelpers

WOW.this fine establishment did not let me down one bit.i came in by myself just out of sheer curiosity and the reputation it has."good" and man o man was impressed .the hostess greeted me and sat me ASAP .my server was right on top if my orders and guided me perfectly threw the menu as I was a first timer and made that clear for a better experience,which I suggest.i got the pescado tres tacos with a sangria .very delicious and a healthy amount.the overall decor of the place makes you feel at ease and has alot of local art up for sale.when I was finished and laying the owner/chef came out and greeted me and I thanked her very much and she bought me a shot of the finest tequila they had as well as another customer.what can I say other than perfect.i will devour that whole menu.see ya soon ladies.stay classy yelpers

i love the place,pretty consitent,i love that they dont use LARD in there beans,so veggie friendly for all of you greens out there.the place isnt no 5 star dining expeirence.but it isnt dirty,the staff is not friendly but not overly happy seeing how they have to deal with late night drunks and they all to common family that doesbt quite know what they want and ask there advice as if the employees give a sh*t.all the time your in line,might as well be on the phone.go there its better than filiasquirtos.

holy moly.this place is gooooooooooooooooooood.im a bbq snob.i like to think,and this place takes the cake.plenty of  sauce choices.the serving portions are huge.not even funny.they offer plenty of different ways to get your meat cooked and seasoned.the mac and cheese is heaven.so cheesy twiced baked yummy goodness for your belly.the bbq chicken is mouth watering and im picky about that dish,usually you get it dry from other places.open till 10 so perfect for my late schedule.if i ate there evry night id be a large loveeee man,so i space my visits out....go get qued now

ok.here we go.im a 4 peaks man.so that being said....i like good food and beer,hence thats why im on here,duh.there ipa was good but to bitter for my taste,there devils ale was good.not sold on there whole selection yet.i had 4 othere firends with me.and we all got burgers.and i was quiet impressed,i got the black bean burger.they put a southwest twist on it with quacamole that over poered the overall taste.it had a bit to much garlic and pepper in it.the patty it self was mooshier than i like and not sweet/bold like normal.the others had stuffed burgers.and man they were huge and all cooked just as requested.i had a side of slaw,crap.dont get it,to much mayo.no flavor.i.m going back to venture further in the menu,so stayed tuned yelpers.stay classy

,so I get a text to meet at this spot and I put the name and address together and im like wtf,makes no sense,im in,so im thinking some wannabe swank mockery of a white trash bar/grill, Wrong,I was shocked and overly impressed by this restaurant/bistro 70 decor spot,the food is orgasmicly infused to take you way back to comfortable times and drinks that will blow your mind,the lemonchella blew me out of the water,one its just like my grandpa made and two,Big in az. Im a regular po vida unless the get a huge ego and drug problem and lose the staff/chefs.

Super friendly staff,even though there steeler fans.Haha.set inside the antique mall on Arizona ave and highland.small nice joint with really good all beef dogs,I got the suggested "Frankie d" with habenro bbg,on sesame bun,super good.I got a side of mac n cheese,because im a mac n cheese buff,it was basically kraft mac n cheese with a blend of different cheese dumped in w what seemed to be black pepper and cayenne pepper and butter residooo.I,ve made similiar version before.all in all,really good hotdog joint,I will return to try some other combos,they won me over,but im still a teds guy threw and threw.stay classy yelpers

i went to this "Restaurant" twice to many.its across the street from my work and thought id support a new business,i wished i hadnt.first the place is an old jack n box with Little renovation done.the dish portions were small.the prices were high,the service was slow.the first time i order a basil leave salad.and it came out.and what i saw was 2 spears of romaine lettuce with basically coos coos in the middle and oil on the bottom.,DISGUSTING.then i the next visit i paid 7 dollars for side coconut "jumbo"shrimp .BAD.i got 4 small super oily pieces that had no flavor and the beef lo mien was a whole other bad choice,DONT EVER GO THERE.

Good mexican food w traditional sonara selection,the tortas are by far the best I ever had.they are big and grilled like paninis,they come with lays chips,weird but its a college town,they set up the inside like chipoltle so its easy for them drunk kiddies to get no pico on thee burro,because like filisquirtos they always forget,im sold on this place as of now,stay gold.
