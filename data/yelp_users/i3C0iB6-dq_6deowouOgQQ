Yum! Never a let down. Fantastic pho and the egg rolls with fish sauce are a must try. I also love the thai iced tea. Nice staff and very reasonable prices.

So apparently this location is closed to remodel which is totally fine. Upgrades are great. But how about letting your customers know that the location is temporarily closed??? Drove all the way here and even called before hand. Not even a message on the voicemail that said they weren't open.....

Best authentic Mexican food in Arizona.  I have nothing bad to say about this place. Great food. Great service. Fast and friendly.

Awesome little car dealership. We got a great deal and everyone was very nice and accommodating.  We had an issue with the AC about a week after we purchased the vehicle and they fixed it free of charge with no issues. Ask for Bob!

Wow is all I can say. My boyfriend and I decided to try a new place out today and I'm sorry we did. We didn't have a whole lot of time because I had to be at work. We should have taken it as a bad sign when we weren't even greeted at the door. Once we were seated the waitress took our order and then we waited for about 15 minutes. She then came back to our table and told us that she LOST OUR ORDER and tried to take it again. Needless to say we won't be going here again.  Very disappointing.

We found Poindexter on Groupon.  Anthony and Joe were AMAZING! Super fast, professional and friendly. Poor Anthony was even allergic to cats which we have and it didnt low him down a bit! AND they were short a guy but still made awesome time! We will DEFINITELY use them next time we move. Thanks for making the difficult process of moving sooooo much easier! :-)   -Juan and Jenelle
