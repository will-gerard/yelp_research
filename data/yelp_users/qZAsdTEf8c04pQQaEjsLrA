I was the rating on yelp but didn't take the time to read the reviews, it's the Macaroni Grill, I know what their food is like and so it can't be that bad right? Wrong. A Monday night, they were not busy, the waiter was SLOOOW. Good was good, salad a little wilted but overall very good salads, entrees and bread. Took 1.5 hours for the dinner and we ordered promptly. The waiter just took forever in between everything, even bringing the to go boxes, bringing the check and bringing the bill after he finally ran it.   The staff seemed disconcerted, lots of people working quietly and expressionless. Our waiter even dissed his management a couple times. Unprofessional.

Female friendly auto shop -- I've been taking my vehicles here for years and trust them 100%. They are friendly and helpful. As a single mom with 3 vehicles in the household to maintain I've relied on Community Tire to be our go-to place for all things auto.   I feel they are always 100% honest with me - which is huge - they have earned my trust and I recommend them to my friends and family in the area.   When we bring our vehicles in for service they always take care of what I'm asking and give me a list of anything that might need attention in the future. They always tell me what can wait and should just be watched. To me, this is very helpful because I know what bills might be coming in auto maintenance. It's also helpful because I know they are not trying to give me a list of immediate repairs.   They have come to my house to help me get my vehicle to the shop when I had a tire that wouldn't hold air for hardly a mile.   I trust them enough to allow my teen daughter to take her car there by herself for it's oil changes or other routine maintenance.

I have used Purcells a few times, its close and convenient. I'm done after the most recent experience. I took my vehicle there for new tires and then took it back at replacement time. They put new tires on and I left for a weekend get away. Great, flat tire! A little shop in Pine fixed my tire, the valve stem was leaking. All the valve stem seals were old and dry rotted, something Purcells should have done with the new tires.  I called them and they said they don't replace them, that's extra. So, I took it to Community Tire at 51st and Cactus and they replaced them all for me and also showed me that Purcells damaged the bead on the tire when they put them on. Back to Purcells where they tell my son they always replace the valve stems..... Ok. Which is it?  So, I'm done with Purcells. Community Tire treats me great, are honest and try to save me money and keep me safe. As a woman getting her vehicle serviced, it's important to me to feel that I'm being treated fairly with honest advice from the professionals.

Ambassador is very friendly and professional. I switched to them after receiving unprofessional service from another company. They are great at communicating when they will be coming for service. I'm glad I made the switch to Ambassador.

Called out to fix ice dispenser, they did the same thing we do to self clean the dispenser. Ran hot water through it and and fixed nothing. Their suggestion was to defrost the self defrosting refrigerator. Charged $65.00 for nothing. The older gentleman seemed to know something was wrong but the younger guy who was in charge did nothing. If you know something is wrong and don't fix it then don't charge. Terrible rip off. Do not use.

I used to never go to this Dunkin Donuts because they skimp on frosting the donuts - it's a small smear - this had improved for months the donuts were normal quality for a Dunkin Donuts. Now, again the last few times I've been in - back to the same - barely a smear, not even covering 1/4 inch in some parts of the donut.   This Dunkin Donuts needs new management. Manager working register today was not friendly at all; there was a long line and he was trying to rush everyone through which is great, but do so with a smile.  The drive through line was long so I went inside to pick my donuts and I was glad that I did because that is when I saw again the donuts were barely frosted. So, I chose something other that our normal Chocolate Frosted.  I don't get it - this location is SUPER BUSY all the time so I'm sure the profit is there; hire friendly staff and don't reduce the quality of your product.

I don't normally stop at this Dunkin Donuts but I did on my way to work. A million times better than the Dunkin Donuts by my house! Lots of frosting, quick drive through, very nice looking donuts. They have my business. I will definitely stop at this location again.

I'm gonna say this place is 5 star. Been here 3 times since they opened and it's definitely on my list to keep coming back.   Love the baja style fish and shrimp tacos! Beer battered is delicious, takes a little longer, just a few minutes, but worth the wait. Steak and chicken tacos also on point. Everything is fresh and you have SO many options!   Owner is on site and super nice hard working guy. You can see his staff respects and likes him.   Reading some of the other reviews I think people are being too harsh, when a restaurant opens it takes a little time for the crew to be performing as a team. Instead of writing a bad review talk to the manager and let them correct their problem. Revisit the establishment and then write your review!   I hate to see such a great place getting negative reviews when they just needed some time to learn and start functioning smoothly!   Good job Chronic staff and owner!
