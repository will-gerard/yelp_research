When I think Royal Palms, I think romantic getaway. A quaint yet exquisite resort, the Royal Palms was built in 1929 to emulate a colonial Spanish retreat. Colonial as in when the Spaniards were conquering the New World.  All of the historical details are presented on a frescoed wall in one of the courtyards.    We had heard some great things about J Cook's and decided to spend a leisurely Sunday morning dining on the patio. If you're looking to be treated like royalty, you want to dine here  I enjoyed exploring the hotel after a luxe breakfast at J.Cooks.  The staff are incredibly accomodating.  What an ideal location for an intimate stay-cation!  It's a nice place to go to grab some drinks and appetizers, I will definitely be back to see what more the resort has to offer!

Yes, I'm spoiled.  I grew up in Denver and enjoyed DIA--the most pristine airport you will ever visit--for the majority of my life.  In comparison, Sky Harbor is just another run-of-the-mill airport.    The food sucks.  One time before a flight I had a teriyaki chicken bowl at one of the generic restaurants (I decided this would be one of the most healthy options aside from Quiznos--too many delicious dipping sauces...).  I must not have been thinking about the effects of eating a dish with an astronomical amount of sodium, because my feet swelled so much that I had to remove my shoes during the flight.  Lovely.    Parking is a nightmare.  There is no logic the parking garage.  It corkscrews you up and you're suddenly on level 6, without a hint as to the location of the terminal's entrance.  When I flew back home from my trip, I went out to the parking garage to find my car, only to realize that I was in the wrong terminal.  If you're flying on different airlines in and out of Sky Harbor, make note of the terminal where your car is parked!    One must take a shuttle between terminals to get between them.  Never fun after a day of traveling.  I thought it would be relatively painless to simply pick someone up or drop them off here.  What a nightmare.  Especially when you have to reach terminal 2.    Beware: terminal 2 has no clearly marked signs for passenger drop off.  I had to circle around and almost ended up back on the 202, all while dodging the rude taxi and shuttle drivers that LOVE to cut me off.  Disastrous when your precious cargo is about to miss their flight.      The signs to get back on the 202 aren't very clear either.  I need arrows.  I need signs that say "left lane 202 E"  or "right lane 202 W" (disclaimer:  I have no clue if the right or left lane take you east or west).  How in the world they twist you around each side of every terminal and loop you through to the highway, I have no clue.    Obviously, I don't enjoy coming here.  But the hope of enjoying my destination city keeps me coming back.  Plus, I have no other choice.  Unless I buy my own jet.  Even then I will probably still have to deal with the crazy taxi drivers.

We decided to go to Rock Bottom before a movie.  We walked in and were informed that there was a 30 minute wait for a table in the "dining room" but that we could opt to sit in the bar area.  So we did the latter.  There were lots of open booths in the "dining room", which was kind of frustrating, but I know that restaurants have to stagger their tables so the kitchen doesn't get overloaded...but seriously, it's a big restaurant...  I've been to Rock Bottom several times, both in Denver and Arizona, and I've never had an overly pleasant experience.  During our meal I was reminded why I don't really go out of my way to eat here.  The waitress would disappear for long periods of time, and all the other waitresses wouldn't make eye contact with anyone other than the diners at their tables.  Frustrating...  We had the pretzels to start, which were really good.  But, in my experience, even microwavable pretzels are delicious...It came with a side of cheese sauce with some herbs in it...honestly it tasted like velveeta, cilantro and rotel canned tomatoes.  Sub-par.    I had the steak spinach salad, which was described as "fresh baby greens with gorgonzola, walnuts, tomatoes and red onion tossed in a balsamic vinegarette".  The red onion overwhelmed the salad.  The tomato was mealy.  There was hardly any gorgonzola, and the walnuts were nonexistant.  I was bombarded with soggy croutons.  Rock Bottom is just not the place to spend money on food.  It's a bar with a handful of unique beers.  Yard House is MUCH better if you're looking for a dining experience/brewery, and it's closer to the theater.  And their spinach salad rocks.

Sakana is another typical sushi place. I wasn't blown away, nor do I feel that the quality of fish justified the expense.   It's a small place and we requested the first available seats; after 10 minutes we were seated at the Sushi Bar. Our chairs backed up to the kitchen entrance, which was literally two feet away.  I distinctly remember watching a basketball game during this meal, since the TVs are right in front of your face at the sushi bar.   It took forever just to get water. By the time we ordered happy hour was over and we had to pay full price. We put the order in and each roll came out at least five minutes a part. The fish was not really fresh--it looked like it had been sitting in the cooler for too long. After we had been finished for 15 minutes another roll they'd forgotten about came out. We were full. The sushi chef let us know: "No worries, someone else will order it soon", as he placed it on top of the cooler to sit....and sit...  I usually go into detail about each item I order, but it was so nondescript I practically forgot what we had by the time we got to the car.

You know the Ross commercials that go something like "I got it at Ross..."  I wish. I have not found a single thing of use at this store.   I'm always greeted by a security guard (not always the most qualified-looking individuals...), and I feel like a criminal as I roam the sparse racks with a shopping cart with a vertical five foot pole attached. It's like I'm in kindergarden and the teacher needs to see my every move.   Every garment seems to be ill-fitting, polyester and/or flawed.  If I do find something, I feel like I need to wash it prior to wear.    Sometimes you can find some decent odds and ends:  home wares, linens, socks, scarves, toys...yet, the search for them is time consuming and often disappointing.   I prefer Target. Or TJ Maxx. Or if I'm feeling trendy, H&M.

I was really really looking forward to dining at Benihana for lunch with my business team.  We were a few minutes late and the hostess informed us that she thought we weren't coming. What a welcome!  All 10 of us squeezed around the teppan grill and waited for our waitress. She took our drink orders and disappeared for five minutes. One of us switched seats and the waitress was completely thrown off when she returned with our beverages. What a personal touch!   We waited. And waited. And waited. Had our drinks refilled, then FINALLY the chef showed up. He complained that one of my colleagues was in the way of his food cart. He was sarcastic and condescending during the entire preparation.  The "theatrics" of it all were sub-par.  My memories of a joyous dining experience here were squashed.   Don't be fooled--just because it's cooked in front of you doesn't qualify it as "healthy". EVERYTHING is cooked in oil, heaps of butter, soy sauce and salt. The chicken was tough, but the sauce was deliciously spicy.   The afternoon and evening after that lunch I felt nauseous, bloated and useless. My saliva feels thick because I'm so dehydrated from the sodium and fat.    Eating at Benihana reinforces my commitment to eating food I can feel good about--fare that Benihana does not cater to.

It was around 9:20 pm on a Friday, and I was starving. Pulled out my iPhone, Yelped 'sushi'. Decided to give the much-raved about Sushi on Shea a shot.   I was seated at the sushi bar--one of the largest I've dined at in Scottsdale.  Directly behind the sushi bar is a gigantic fish tank, serving as a reminder of the living creatures you are about to consume.  It does add a nice aesthetic touch.    At this point in the night there were only a few people dining so I had my own personal sushi chef. I started out with hot green tea and some edamame.  It was cooked perfectly (I always hate it when it's slightly over- or underdone.)    After much contemplation and internal debate (the sushi menu is quite large, including many nigiri- and sashimi-style options), I chose the Houston roll, vegetarian roll and unagi nigiri.    The Houston:  fresh tuna, cucumber, and jalapeno.  The tuna was indeed incredibly fresh and the portion generous.  Very tasty.    The vegetarian:  cabbage, carrot, sprouts, cucumber and asparagus.  It was HUGE!  I loved how I felt like I was getting a full serving of veggies from this one dish.    The Unagi was incredibly tender, although the cut of the eel could have been larger.  Props for minimizing the amount of rice it sat upon, and for using the eel sauce in moderation.    I loooove ginger, and when I asked for a LOT, the sushi chef presented me with a plate of generously cut ginger--clearly premium ginger, if there exists such a thing.  Bonus points for removing the paper chopstick wrapper from the vicinity and for refilling my tea before I had to ask for more.    A few bucks more per roll, but for fish this fresh I'm willing to spend the extra dough.  Don't be turned off by this--there are several cheaper rolls (including the above mentioned vegetarian roll), and I hear that happy hour is fantastic.    I've FINALLY found my go-to sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.  And because of this, I think I'll be able to call Scottsdale home.  Thank you Sushi on Shea.

Holy slices of heaven on earth!!!!  This pizza is incredible.    After a long day at work my boyfriend and I decided to order in. I turned to Yelp, found Rosati's, and 45 minutes later we had a glorious pizza delivered to my door.    We had the double-dough pizza with cheese and pepperoni. They hand-roll (braid?) the crust under itself, creating the ideal crunch and chew factor.   There is something special about the cheese...or maybe it's the herb blend on top...or both. Whatever it is, I found myself eating a third (and fourth) slice.   When you want to do pizza, don't waste your time or money on other chains--Rosati's is the place to go!!!

My former dry cleaner started to go downhill, so I turned to the trusted Yelp community for some guidance.  I owe Marisa S. for pointing me in the direction of Monte Carlo Cleaners.  Thank you! :-)  I brought in about 20 items (let's just say I was very skeptical about trusting a new cleaners, so I had a stockpile of clothes...), both new and old.  At $2.50 an item, it's a little more pricey than my former cleaners, but I'd rather pay 25 cents more for extra care and attention.  Keep in mind, there's a small fee for using a debit card (no credit option); bring cash to avoid this.    The clothes came out beautifully.  My brand new sweaters were not "pilly" in texture, but had renewed vibrancy and softness.  They even managed to remove ball point pen from  my cream-colored silk blouse.  Thank goodness!!!!    As I unwrapped each item I noticed that they used plastic clips instead of metal prongs to affix the skirts to the hanger.  This in itself is another reason why I am eternally grateful that I found Monte Carlo Cleaners.

As an artist, I've come to be very picky about the stores from which I purchase my art supplies. Arizona Art Supply is a GREAT store!!! Every time I visit I overhear the staff's experienced recommendations; they take the time to ensure that every customer's needs are satisfied.   I am always immediately welcomed as I delve into the fully stocked and well-organized aisles. Yes, this is my kind of art supply store!  As I browse the expansive selection of everything from  drawing supplies to paint, easels and canvases to ceramic tools, an overwheming desire to create comes over me. AZ Art Supply has a HUGE selection of my favorite brands--Prismacolor and Golden Paints!    Although this store is smaller, the prices are reasonable--they beat out Michael's prices for nearly every item. If you're looking for exceptional quality, a diverse selection and a knowledgeable staff, Arizona Art Supply is your best bet.

Denise cut and colored my hair tonight and I couldn't be more pleased with her work. She has owned The Urge for 17 years; her depth of knowledge and enthusiasm for hair attest to her business's longevity.   Denise is an incredibly energetic, charismatic and relatable woman. She shares her knowledge with every one of her clients.  She goes above and beyond because she takes the time to learn about the preferences each client has for their hair.  I walked in and was warmly greeted by Denise herself. She immediately engaged me in conversation as she was finishing up another client's hair, and suggested I look through her vast magazine collection for inspiration.  She wrapped up everything with her client by demonstrating styling tips--things that are genius!--I knew I was in good hands.  She showed me a color book and went to work, whipping out perfect foils and color in record time!    I was her last client so she sat with me by the dryer (complete with a massage chair!) while my hair processed. We flipped through magazines and chatted as if we had been friends for years.  The shampoo was just as I liked it--the perfect water temperature, a firm scalp massage and a thorough rinse of product.  My once-lopsided layers are perfected, my style is polished and volumized, and my color looks rich once more, all for an EXTREMELY reasonable rate!  I received 30% off for mentioning the coupon on The Urge's website but I tipped her on the full amount--she definitely deserves it!  I feel refreshed, beautiful and I have a couple new products (and many new styling tips!) to get the most out of my new 'do.  Getting my hair done by Denise is something I will look forward to--I'm already excited to go back!

I am searching for a good doctor here in Scottsdale and found this practice on Cigna.com.  I called to see if Dr. Magda Williams was accepting new patients.  She was indeed.  I asked the receptionist what the next step was since I was a new patient.  She let me know that I'd have to have an initial appointment to establish care, deeming the doctor my primary care physician.    Could I meet the doctor before signing the agreement?  She had to ask someone and then let me know that I could meet with Dr. Soni (a male doctor) during this initial appointment, but Dr. Williams could give me a physical after I establish care.    Why would I want to meet with some other doctor to establish care with Dr. Williams?  I asked her if Dr. Williams had any open appointments the next day; Dr. Soni did at 2:15.  I let her know I'd think about it; I didn't feel comfortable with this arrangement.    I received a call today from Scottsdale Family & Urgent Care informing me that I had missed an appointment at 2:15.  Did I want to reschedule?  I called back and told the receptionist about the initial call.  There is clearly a lack of communication at this office.  I don't think I'll be going to this Family Practice.    Two stars for persistance.  I really wish I could write a better review about the actual DOCTORS at the practice--not a critique of the protocol and competence of the receptionists--but I guess that's why they call them "gate keepers".

Whenever I go to the Home Depot I try to make it seem like I know exactly what I'm looking for (even though I usually don't).  Even when I've been "on a mission" I'm always approached by the staff.    Customer service is consistent, prices are competitive, and it's organized in a fairly logical manner.  I always walk out feeling confident with my selection.  This is another store that can be a nightmare for an indecisive person like myself; a decent selection of inventory always makes it hard to choose!  Ask someone for assistance and you'll find it much easier to make a decision.    I purchased my patio furniture from this store.  There was a deal going on for free shipping with an online purchase, so we asked a sales associate if he could call in the online order for us.  Within fifteen minutes my beautiful set had been ordered; it arrived in a massive box two days later.  I had to ask a friend to help me set it up--the delivery people do not offer assistance with assembly (that I know of).   What more is there to say?  It's Home Depot.  I've never had a bad experience at this store.

I've been searching for high quality sushi for months, and I finally found it!    Hiro is a smaller, unpretentious establishment with enthusiastic and well-trained sushi chefs. We sat at the sushi bar (we opted for first-available seating)--I loved watching the chefs slice each cut of fish with precision and flawless technique.   Hiro gets my stamp of approval because they actually listened to me when I said I wanted a LOT of ginger. Yes, an entire plate piled high is what I mean by a lot!  Thank you Hiro!  We had edamame (perfectly cooked with just the right amount of salt), the squid salad (the sauce was the perfect compliment to the fish), crazy roll, striped roll, and unagi, tuna and scallop nigri. Each cut of fish was extremely generous and tasted fresh. There was a LOT of rice in the crazy roll, which was good (balanced out the tempura shrimp) and bad (I prefer to fill up on fish, not rice).     Everything is made-to-order, and the chefs hand over the plates with pride; I've been to countless sushi joints where the chefs whip out as much product as they can without giving any care to the quality.  Not at Hiro!  Everything comes together deliciously because of their carefully prepared components.   We finished with the hot green tea--no need for sugar here because of its subtle (not artificial!) sweetness.  My favorite part was the mochi!  They serve the best kind, something I've been searching for since Sushi Den and Izakaya Den (premier sushi restaurants) in Denver. We had the red bean and green tea. Mochi is hard to describe, but its a creamy, perfectly portioned, and refreshing treat!

Walgreens has a plethora of products--everything from beauty products to cleaning items, snacks to toys.  I prefer Walgreens over CVS because the inventory is organized with some practicality in mind.  The toys and knick-knacks have their own section instead of being randomly placed throughout the store.    The beauty section is front-and-center--a blessing and a curse.  Luckily, the snacks are on the far end of the store; I've already picked out my items by the time I reach the east end--when your cart is filled with $20 or $30 of merchandise, those Fudge Shoppe Deluxe cookies just don't seem as essential.    Walgreens is my pharmacy of choice.  The pharmacy staff are prompt, polite and professional.  They always ask if you will be waiting in-store for your prescription.  Have other shopping to do or time to kill?  They will fill your 'scrips promptly.  Every time I say I'll stick around, I've been politely paged when my prescriptions are filled.  Excellent service.    I also like how there's a "Walgreens brand" of most items.  These products are just as good as their brand name counterparts.  Plus, they're about a buck cheaper.    Even though this store doesn't have a Take Care Clinic, it's still a Walgreens--it serves its function well.

My first experience with AJ's was just an iced coffee.  It was cheap (about $1.25 for a medium--the size of a Vente at Starbucks), and the flavor was incredible.  It has good body and a nutty roundness to it that I can't find anywhere else.  The only thing I hate is their number system--take a ticket and you'll be helped as if it's the DMV.    The meat and produce is unparalleled.  AJ's has a deal with farmers where they get the first pick on produce and meat.  The quality of fruit and veggies is unsurpassable, and their meat is divine.  I purchased a pound of Choice filet mignon; it was one of the best cuts of meat I've ever consumed.  Incredible.    Really expensive, but you're paying for the quality.  Pretty snooty people work and shop here, which I prefer to avoid.

This gym...is...not exactly ideal.  I would give the place 4 stars just rating the trainers, BUT, all things considered, it's more like 2 stars.  Here's why:  The facility. It's so-so. The GM/Owner (?) boasts that he's having everything renovated in a couple weeks: flat screens, rubber floors, the facility next door actually being conjoined to create one space...however wonderful this might be, it's going to disturb the flow of senior citizens and regulars--something I will return to 24 Hour Fitness to avoid.   I received a free fitness evaluation by a personal trainer when I received my membership and I thought it was really helpful!  Wes is extremely knowledgeable and energetic, and he showed me several new exercises and he taught me how to use a foam roller properly.    The equipment is standard. Nothing special; however, there is some pretty nice equipment in the new space next door, but classes for a Tai Kwon Do academy often occupy that space.    There's only one Gauntlet/Stairmaster. As one of the best pieces of cardio equipment you can find, this is inadequate. I looked around to find a bottle of disinfectant to wipe off the machine; I wandered the place for a bit and couldn't find a single bottle. Oh, but there's hand sanitizer galore!  I cringe when I grasp any piece of equipment in the place.   And then, there's the Saturday exercise classes that change instructors every week. The first time I went it was fun. Not a really challenging workout, but amusing nonetheless.   And then, because I had brought a friend to the class, the DM appeared to pitch his gym to my innocent buddy. I'm still confused on the terms of his membership; he put my friend in the computer and didn't charge him--they'll "figure it out later". Okay....  And then today, as I was walking out of the locker room three trainers cornered me, begging me to sign up for this Saturday's class.  I had to say "no" four times and give an elaborate excuse before I was released.   Maybe I'm picky, or maybe I don't enjoy seniors oogling at me during my workout.  It's nice because it's right next to my office, but I still prefer 24 Hour Fitness compared to this.

Chipotle. Fast. Healthy, or not (depending on what you're in the mood for). I love the consistency of service and quality across locations. I grew up in Colorado and have enjoyed many meals at the original location by the University of Denver. No matter what location visit, you will receive delicious food made with quality ingredients.   I was always a chicken burrito with extra rice, black beans, corn salsa, lettuce and cheese kind of gal. Most recently I've fallen in love with the salad. Romaine lettuce with all the burrito toppings you prefer.   My latest creation is chicken, fajita veggies, pico de gallo, corn salsa with a tiny bit of cheese, hot red chili salsa and dressing on the side. I take this creation home, put it in a big bowl, toss everything together and devour. The marinade from the chicken and the juices from the salsa and veggies create an awesome dressing. I dip my fork in the side of salsa and vinegarette before each bite, providing just the right amount of tang and spice.   The combinations are endless. I dream of Chipotle.

My aunt and uncle were in town with a couple of their friends, so I decided Dragonfly would be the perfect place to enjoy a leisurely Sunday breakfast. I always walk by the patio area when I'm on my lunch hour and everything always looks so delicious!   We walked in and were greeted by a very friendly gentleman who noticed my visitors' Rockies attire; everyone immediately hit it off. We were seated at a table just outside the entrance and he took our beverage orders. Strong, hot coffee all around, and a blackberry green tea for me.    Shortly after, a striking woman came up (I'm assuming she's one of the owners?) to take our breakfast order, also continuing the conversation about the Rockies. She made honest suggestions and helped me decide on the Fresh Start omelette (egg whites, mushrooms, spinach, cherry tomatoes and salsa, served with fresh fruit) and a multigrain pancake.  She frequently checked in with us throughout the meal, carrying on the conversation, which gave the experience a personal touch.  I like this. I wish there were more restaurants with waitstaff that are genuinely interested in their customers!   Overall, the food was delicious, fresh and thoughtfully prepared. My omelette needed a little salt and pepper, but I can't complain since it was made with egg whites!  The pancake was incredible.  It had more density than your typical white fluffy pancake, but I really liked this!  It soaked up the syrup perfectly.   The food took a while to come out, but when it did everything was as we ordered. No forgotten items or anyone waiting for their meal.  And every dish looked fantastic.   I will be back to try the pecan cinnamon roll or the bananas foster with french toast. This will definitely be one of my go-to spots whenever family comes out to visit!

I needed to mail a package over lunch, and I didn't want to go to the post office. Of course, I turned to Yelp and found this little shipping store within walking distance of my office.  It's located on the west side of the AJ's center, right next to Samurai Sam's. There wasn't a line so I was in, out and on my way.   Quick, easy and hassle-free.

I love living at San Antigua. The leasing staff are very attentive and personable; they're more like friends than my landlords. The one problem I've had is with my sink; it was leaking heavily and I put in a call to maintenance. Shortly thereafter I received a call from the head of the emergency maintenance crew to confirm someone was on the way to fix it.   Some background: after accepting a job offer here in Scottsdale in October 2010 I had to find an apartment--and FAST. I toured 20 apartment complexes in North Scottsdale, the McCormick Ranch area, Old Town, and Phoenix/Tempe. San Antigua was perfect: very well kept, clean apartments with new carpet & appliances, fresh paint, spacious living spaces, gorgeous grounds, nice gym & luxe clubhouse--AND it was just a couple miles from Old Town (I looked at the Palladium and San Marin, San Antigua's sister property, both had a college/party vibe; I recently graduated and wanted something more...mature).   So far, so good!  Now I just have to face my first AZ summer...we'll see if I survive!

My disposal was leaking again.  I called Nicole at the Leasing Office and let her know my predicament.  She was incredibly attentive and scheduled for maintenance to come by the next day.  Ramon came to my apartment this morning, and immediately found a solution to the problem.  He used a different kind of sealant than the other maintenance guy used to prevent leakage.    He was conversational and polite (he even rang the doorbell a second time when he returned from picking up a new part).  He wiped his feet, and even offered to take out the trash.  This is yet another reason why I love living in San Antigua.  Thank you Ramon!

The last time I'd been to the Chart House was when I was 8 years old, but at the original location in Aspen, Colorado. It's everything I remember it to be.   It's a restaurant you plan on going to--a "special occasion" worthy place. This location is no exception.  Expect upscale dining in a gorgeous setting. Be sure to make a reservation and ask to be seated by the windows.    The waitstaff go out of their way to ensure that you are having an enjoyable meal.  The maitre'd even comes by as you near dessert to introduce himself.    The fare is mostly fish and beef. I enjoyed the seafood grill: Asian glazed salmon, shrimp scampi, and a jumbo-lump crab cake with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and asparagus. I devoured every last bit of fish on my plate.   One highlight of dining here is the salad bar. Yes, the salad bar. But it's different--it's the Chart House salad bar!!!  Order an entree and for $8.50 you can enjoy unlimited caviar, fresh fruit, cold salads (i.e. pasta salad, potato salad, artichoke heart salad...) and traditional salad bar items. Or, for $16 you can make this your entree. Savor this. Go back for seconds. And thirds. Maybe even fourths.   I wasn't expecting our entrees to come out so fast. 14 minutes to be exact, the waiter informed us...a little too fast for such a high-end restaurant. I prefer to savor my salad bar items. Linger a bit before the big show, if you know what I mean.   Toward the end of the meal an inebriated party of four was seated next to us. What a scene. When you're paying top dollar and expecting a pleasant dining experience, the last thing you want is drunkards offering to buy your table shots. Completely uncalled for. I know it's not the restaurant's fault, but they shouldn't have seated them in the first place. It's not a sports bar--it's the Chart House!

I have never walked into a business only to be discouraged from spending money.    I decided to try out Energy Tanning one day after my workout at LA Fitness.  I walked in.  No one was at the desk.  I peeked my head around the corner.  No one.  Finally, one employee appeared to help me.  I asked if I had to buy a package or a membership; I had just canceled my monthly package at Bronze Boutique and I was not looking to accrue more expenses.    I was explained the level system of beds in a condescending manner, and then was informed that I would not see any color with just one session.  Yes, even on one of the strongest beds.  The verdict:  I'd have to purchase a package to see results.    I let her know I've been outside and tanning fairly consistently and that I'm not "starting from scratch".  She said "I'd hate to have you spend $30 on a session when you won't see results immediately".  Wow.  I thanked her for her honesty and strolled out to enjoy the rest of my Sunday.    Good luck, Energy Tanning.

I gave Energy Tanning another shot.  I was greeted by a cheerful employee immediately.  She really was very nice and made many good recommendations, from lotions to my desired level of darkness and the appropriate bed for my needs.    I actually got to tan this time!  I was quite impressed by the selection of beds during the Grand Tour.  There are many different beds of various levels, to accommodate nearly any budget.  For Level 5 alone there were three different beds to choose from.  THAT is variety!    I still didn't want to get set up with a membership, and this time around the associate did not pressure me into signing up.  THANK YOU.  The bed was intense!  It was equipped with shoulder lamps, climate control, and lamp intensity choices.    It's pricey, but now that I see the selection of beds and the results from the Level 5 bed, I see why.  It's tanning at its best.

I had never been to a "gun club" nor had I even seen a firearm first hand prior to visiting Scottsdale Gun Club.  I was nervous.  Everything that defines me goes against owning/using firearms; as a Jewish young woman, I was raised with the belief that guns are not something we should own...and as a liberal Coloradan, using firearms for practice and enjoyment is not exactly something I do on a typical Saturday.    Nevertheless, I needed to go; as this was an important time to "bond" with my former teammates.  I walked in and noticed all of the inventory for sale--ammo, firearms, camo-gear, and safes.   I watched a firearm safety video where I learned basic protocol.  Then I was given some "eyes" (i.e. eye protection) and some "ears" (i.e. big headphone-like things that muffled the noise of the explosions).   I entered one automatic door, than another to enter the shooting range.  I was really surprised that some parents were letting their kids have at it.  it was a little scary...shouldn't there at least be a minimum height qualification or something?!    The guns were loud (yes, I know this is obvious), and the thought of so many potentially fatal weapons surrounding me was a bit frightening.  That "rush" one is supposed to get after pulling the trigger just didn't happen for me.  Oh well, I guess firearms are not my thing.    Not that I have much to compare it to, Scottsdale Gun Club is a very, very nice facility.  Impressive.  The staff are helpful and experienced.  Their demeanor calmed me down a bit.    And now I can say I've gone shooting at one of the most prestigious gun clubs in Arizona.  One more thing checked off the bucket list.

I was bracing myself for a long line, incompetent employees and slow service. Not at this location!  An employee graciously held open the door for me and I was greeted by a second upon entering the store, who pointed in the right direction for FedEx pickup.   The line went quickly and they immediately found my package. I signed for it and was about to be on my way, until the kid in me decided to shake the box to decipher it's contents. The gentleman who initially helped me whipped out a box cutter so I could take a glimpse inside.  They even opened the door for me on my way out!  Excellent service. Positive attitude. Definitely changed my opinion of FedEx Office!  (at least for this location...)

I normally don't enjoy going to the gyno; my experience has always been awkward and uncomfortable...that is, until I started going to Dr. Mary Deka at Paradise Valley OB-GYN.  I couldn't be happier with Dr. Deka; she really put me at ease.    The facility is high-tech and has an upscale feel to it.  I always hate those doctor's offices where you're forced to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other patients--they've solved this at Paradise Valley OB-GYN; you've got many seating options to choose from in the waiting area.   The staff is polite, respectful and courteous.  My needs are always met and they go out of their way to follow up with patients (again, I've had some experiences at other offices where the patient is expected to follow up...I prefer it to be other other way around).    I couldn't be more satisfied with Dr. Deka and her staff, I highly recommend Paradise Valley OB-Gyn!

I buy the majority of my groceries from Sprouts.  I take advantage of their HUGE bulk selection to stock up on premium-quality items like dried beans, steel cut oats & oatmeal, dried fruit & veggies, granola, rice,  pancake mix, snacks (my weakness are the whole wheat honey pretzel twists), chocolate, and baking staples....best of all the prices are cheap.  The produce is usually of good quality. Sometimes items aren't the best, and prices can fluctuate depending on the weather in the US, but that's true of every grocery store. They sell pre-sliced lunch meat and meals to go, and I've heard great things about the made-to-order sandwiches for $4 (available during lunch).   Don't expect to find items made by Pepsi or Frito-Lay; yet, this is exactly why I like Sprouts.  The oldies music always cheers me up too. I always look forward to shopping here.

A very nice place to get your routine eye exam.  Never in my life have I visited an eye doc with such a huge storefront!  A circular chaise constitutes the "waiting area," and all the employees wear doctors' coats. Even sales reps. (I think that's what they are...I wasn't sure).   Everyone is very, very nice and before I knew it I was visiting with Dr. Farnesworth.  She takes her time to examine your eyes and gets to know you a little bit--no rush to get to the next patient!    The equipment is brand new and seems more high-tech than my old eye doc in Denver. You can even adjust the volume of the music in your exam room. This is what I call patient-oriented!    A couple things knocked off one star.  One, Dr. Farnesworth dilated my pupils and then had me waiting for 25 minutes to finish up the internal eye health portion of the exam. Kind of frustrating when I'm trying to get to work on time...Two, I couldn't help but notice that one employee was dressed in a really short skirt and flip flops under her doctors' coat.  A little too riské for a professional office....(I can't believe I'm actually judging someone on their work clothes, but it caught my attention...just imagine what a man would be thinking...)  A little expensive too, but then again it is an eye exam; anything without insurance is bound to be a little pricey. Contact fittings are out-of-pocket as well.   It was a very pleasant experience; I will be back. Maybe next time I'll decide to purchase some new glasses!

Maybe it's just Scottsdale...maybe it's the fact that I don't dress up to go to Fashion Square...but I've never had a pleasant shopping experience at this location.   Only when I'm with my mom and we're clothed in nicer attire do we get a teeny bit of service. Maybe because we look like we have money to spend?  The attitude of the staff is pretentious, even though they are just retail sales people. Get over yourselves. And learn your trade:  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  When I'm spending $96 on a skirt and $108 on a blouse I want some damn attention. The sales associates are in their own little world, oblivious to the potential customers that grace the store.   When it comes time to purchase my clothes I'm usually ignored, unless I have my cash out and I'm holding $500 worth of merchandise.   This place is the last I want to visit in Fashion Square. I avoid it when I can, but the clothes fit me like a glove...thus my patronage continues.

This place is always worth the wait.  The atmosphere is unique and the food is excellent.  Be patient!   On both occasions I've dined here we passed the time with drinks and appetizers at the bar.  If you sit inside for pre-dinner libations, bring a sweater--the a/c is cranked up and it gets quite chilly.    After finding a table at the bar we had to wait for our [nonexistent] waitress to come take our drink orders...but the Tortilla Factory redeemed themselves.  Our drinks came out in record time, as did our crab dip.  I wasn't impressed with this dish--definitely not what I was expecting crab dip to be.  Definitely ask for extra chips and salsa (and some hot sauce...the salsa isn't spicy at all).   The waitress later came by to apologize; the poor girl was running around servicing over 15 tables by herself!    The 90 minutes quickly passed and we were soon seated on the expansive patio.  It's so intimate and the service is friendly and prompt.  I had the shrimp salad.  The prawns were huge and tender--charred to perfection.  The greens were crisp and plentiful.  The cilantro dressing was AMAZING.  Just the right amount of food.   This is one of my favorite restaurants in town because of the unique touches: fresh, house-made tortillas with garlic butter...candlelit dining...a fountain with blazing fire...delicious food...AND unpretentious people!  Definitely a world of its own.   If you're in Scottsdale, you MUST visit this restaurant!

I was told that this was one of the best dry cleaners in Scottsdale.  I'm increasingly disappointed each time I pick up my dry cleaning.   The first time I took in a few items they came out pretty good, although my silk blouses had odd wrinkles in them. What's the point of spending the money on dry cleaning if you have to meticulously iron the awkward creases and wrinkles out of your nice clothes??  I recently I made the mistake of bringing in some really nice, brand new work clothes (we're talking $105 skirts, $75 blouses), and they freakin put SAFETY PINS not through inconspicuous seams of the garment, as they should (I know this because my very first job was at a dry cleaner--it was common sense to my then-15-year-old self); they stuck the pins wherever they could--including in the front of a blouse, and though the center of a cotton skirt's waistline.  Thanks for piercing my beautiful garments.   Thanks to Seville Cleaners, my wardrobe has been taken down a notch by my desire to have the most cost-effective (i.e. cheap) dry-cleaning. Not only do I waste time driving through the circus of Old Town, but I have to labor over re-pressing every item Seville has touched. It's true--you get what you pay for. At this price, don't expect much.

My dad and I found American Fine Art Editions one night after dining in Old Town.  Never in my life have I viewed such an extensive collection of art by Warhol, Neiman, Picasso, Picot, Rembrandt, Dali,and Delacroix (to name a few).    We were greeted by a saleswoman who strolled through the gallery with us.  She asked my father if we collected art (we do) and what existed in our collection.  American Fine Art editions does have a few pieces by one of our close family friends--Leonardo Nierman.  I could tell the saleswoman was slightly taken aback when we mentioned that our Nierman pieces surpassed theirs in both quality and quantity.    My dad's a nonchalant kind of guy, so the saleswoman's spiel didn't phase him one bit.  The art in our collection is much older (and diverse) than the pieces in American Fine Art Editions; she backed off when she realized that we weren't doing a one-stop-shop.    This is an amazing place to visit.  The art is stunning and the collection is HUGE.  What happens if a fire or other natural disaster occurs?  To lose such a massive collection of art would be a tragedy; I'm guessing they're insured, but if something did happen all of the gorgeous work would be lost forever.    I was reprimanded for trying to photograph of some of the work with my iPhone, which makes sense...but it's not like this is the Met or anything.  Don't bring your kids, unless they're very well-behaved.  This is the kind of place that draws people in to make a sale.  Be armed with your  knowledge and an air that you're not overly impressed.

We went here for my birthday dinner; it was a great experience overall.  The restaurant has a homestyle Italian vibe, it's almost quaint (I say almost because there are spacious booths and large tables, but it still has the feel of an intimate restaurant).  We were seated promptly.      The waiter remembered my fellow diner and was very welcoming.  He had a good grasp of the diverse wine list and helped us decide on a carafe of Chianti (it was my birthday, afterall).  As we decided what to order from their expansive menu of specialties, chicken, veal, steak, pasta and seafood dishes we enjoyed a basket of complimentary warm garlic bread.  The Parmesan cheese (in a jar on every table) looked tempting so we sprinkled some on our bread...delicious.    After much debating between the Chicken Champagne and the Chicken Diablo I decided on the latter, with whole wheat spaghetti and green beans and sauteed onions on the side.  My friend had the Chicken Cilantro.  A soup or salad comes with each entree; I had the soup of the day (eggplant bisque), which had just the right amount of body and richness--I'll admit, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I got to try a few bites of the house salad with bleu cheese dressing--it was heavily dressed, but it was oh so good (I almost wish I had gotten that instead!).  Both chicken dishes were wonderful.  I asked for a side of the spicy marinara to satiate my desire for some tangy spicyness.    To conclude the meal I had the chocolate brownie.  It was drizzled with fudge and topped with blue bunny vanilla ice cream.  And of course, there was a lit birthday candle on top.  The brownie was divine; it tasted more like chocolate cake than a brownie, but it was the best damn cake I've ever had.

Grimaldi's is a wonderful place for a date.  I met him at the restaurant and was pleased to have access to plenty of parking. This made me a happy girl.   There was a table waiting for us (he scored points for getting there early) and our waitress came by almost instantaneously. A+ customer service!  The pizzas are made to order and you have your choice of toppings. No pre-made creations here--you are the creator! After much contemplation we opted for the traditional pizza with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  The crust was perfection, although they could've been more generous with the sauce.    There was a nice wine selection and the waitress gave a refreshingly honest opinion to help me decide. We could've easily split a salad, but we were daring and ordered two varieties--both were pleasers.    There's nothing like excellent pizza, good wine, and a crisp salad while enjoying the company.  What can I say?  He received the first kiss early in the evening.

LOVE this place.  The tea and coffee is bold, unique and mighty tasty.  Five stars for quality.   I always have a pleasant experience, and the staff remembered my name after my second visit!  I can get in, out and on my way in no time.  On the weekends I like to come here with a good book and enjoy a pastry with my coffee.  The waffles call my name.  Yes, they serve waffles.    My gripes:  There could be more comfy chairs in place of all the tables and straight-backed chairs.  It's very chilly inside too, so bring a sweater if you plan on staying.

The employees always ask if I'm finding what I'm looking for, but in a genuine way. Prices are reasonable. I love this place.   The products sold are of consistent, exceptional quality and there are many things that I buy here that other grocers cannot replicate: frozen mango chunks, blueberry muesli, pulled BBQ chicken, perfectly prepared frozen meals...the list goes on!   There are ALWAYS samples being served.  Whether it's fresh sliced pineapple and French vanilla ice cream, or Swedish meatballs with homemade dipping sauce, or any other amazing product, you can always look forward to chatting with the designated sample-giver.   Yes, my friends in Colorado should be very, very jealous of this neighborhood market. They don't know what they're missing!

I really enjoy DeFalco's because of its unique atmosphere and the exceptional, authentic Italian food.    DeFalco's is a family-owned Italian deli and market.  The restaurant is divided by racks of wine, imported pasta and a large inventory of desserts and treats. After ordering at the back of the restaurant by the meat and cheese cases you're free to choose a table; no matter where you choose to sit, that spot in the house becomes your own private restaurant.  Yes, it does take a little bit longer to receive your meal but this is because they take the time to make every dish to order (the sign on the door even indicates this). Whatever you order comes out in its glorious perfection.  And, you get some extra time to stroll around the store as your mind wanders; so many items to choose from, so many meal ideas!    My dinner companion and I split a Caprese salad, a full order of Gnocci with Alfredo and red sauces on the side, an Italian sandwich, and a chocolate cannoli for dessert.   The Caprese: the tomatoes were perfectly ripe, the mozzarella was exquisite (and it was a generous portion!), and the basil was refreshing.  The salad came with a side of olive oil--this olive oil was some of the best I've ever had--and balsamic vinegar.    The Gnocci was incredibly light and slightly chewy; again, another incredibly delicious dish!  The side of red sauce and Alfredo were perfect--I like to go back and forth between dipping in each of them to create sort of a Vodka sauce.  The Alfredo was rich and had a strong garlic flavor, something very unique and quite addicting.    We had to try an Italian sub; after all, the huge list of sandwiches, both hot and cold, was practically calling our names.  The bread had just the right amount of crunch, but it was also chewy and soft in the inside.  I was going to hold myself back from eating the entire thing, but I couldn't.  So damn good.    AND the cannoli!  We chose the chocolate covered variety.  The cream had just the right density and ratio of chocolate chips.  The shell itself was crisp and the chocolate added just enough richness to the dessert.  Incredible.    Anthony DeFalco came to our table to see how we enjoyed our meal, which really completed the whole experience.  He's incredibly passionate about his family's restaurant and explained how they never cut corners on quality ingredients.  We asked about the amazing olive oil that accompanied our Caprese salad, and he went to the back to bring out a bottle wrapped in gold foil.  I only wish I knew where to buy this exceptionally light and pure oil, but then again, that is DeFalco's secret.

Maybe my hopes were too high when I made plans to go to Sunsplash.  I was overwhelmed by the crowd.  So many people were crammed into this relatively small space.  Never in my life have I seen a line for a wave pool.  I typically think of the wave pool as a retreat from the lines.  Not at Sunsplash. The lazy river was so packed I could hardly see the "river" part.  Not exactly a relaxing experience.    Not only that, but the water park seemed less than sanitary.  I saw several people with bloody noses, and I couldn't help but wonder when the last time they thoroughly sanitized the place.  The park is also open at night...I will not be venturing over to Sunsplash after dark.  You know what likes to come out at night?  Bugs.  Big ones.  (I'm a Coloradan...call me spoiled...but large bugs just aren't a part of life where I'm from.)  The slides are fun, especially the gigantic ones.  If you plan to go on the big slides, be sure to bring your friends!  Expect to carry a massive raft up several flights of stairs.  There are no mechanisms that bring the empty rafts up to the slide entrance for customers.  I got a workout just by hauling our raft around!  Whatever you do, do NOT open your water bottles prior to entering the park.  They will throw them out.  Bring a few gigantic bottles and rent a locker; a large cup of ice can be purchased at the concession stand for 25 cents.  Bring cash too.  A locker is $11, but you receive $5 back when you present your receipt with the locker key.  Also, I recommend bringing some plastic flip-flops.  There's nothing worse than tromping around dirty grounds covered with strangers' hairs and other disgusting debris.    Food is quite pricey (no surprise here).  It is a fun place to spend a Saturday, just don't expect anything too elaborate.

We decided to dine at Veneto Trattoria for my farewell dinner and, unfortunately, it was incredibly disappointing.   The staff clearly are not trained in customer service or restaurant etiquette (e.g. grating cheese on the lady's dish first, refilling water glasses, etc).  They hung around the bar area and eyed us as we progressed through the meal.  I couldn't understand a word that our waiter said and he completely disregarded the specifics of my questions.  He could hardly remember the nightly specials; of the vague, unintelligible list about seven dishes, all I caught was "chilled tomato soup."  Shortly thereafter, diners at an adjacent table inquired about the types of pasta on the menu.  Mr. Ego condescendingly responded, "what kind of pasta do you like?"  They went back and forth several times until the customer decided against pasta altogether.  I don't blame him, what a hassle!    The food was completely underwhelming and overly salted.  Portions were unimpressive and basic things like mashed potatoes and pasta obviously originated from a box.  The chicken scallopene was so-so; the meager serving of veggies were the star.  I had a taste of some shell pasta with spicy sausage, it was unremarkable.   Don't waste your time (or money) on overpriced, lackluster food served by a snitty,  impatient waitstaff.  Sorry fellow Yelpers, I just wasn't impressed; I am not compelled to return.

Boredom is not an option at the impressive JW Marriott!   The grounds are expansive, with villas on the west side of the property and the hotel on the east--each side is equipped with restaurants and several pools. Did I mention that there are two golf courses?   Our first stop was at the timeshare villas. Every unit is fully equipped, like an apartment away from home!  The staff are incredibly friendly and the accommodations are high-end.  The main hotel was breathtaking--absolutely the largest hotel I've visited. There are several restaurants to satisfy any craving, from sushi to seafood, Italian to burgers. The JW has it all.   Our destination this particular visit was at the main hotel pool. Don't even try to sneak in...there are pool staff outside the gates handing out wristbands exclusively for registered guests. I was accompanying a founding owner of the resort, so we received our wristbands and towels with zero fuss.    The pools were PACKED. It must have been end of summer vacation time, because there were families swarming the grounds. The highlight is the lazy river. It's pretty small (I was imagining something much bigger), but it certainly was relaxing!  The pool waitstaff were very accommodating. We immediately received a pitcher of water and ordered some raw veggies from the small poolside menu.    Exploring the JW is an excellent way to spend a Saturday. I'm looking forward to my next visit!

Camelback is a fairly challenging hike and the view at the summit is well worth the hard work.  It's conveniently located a couple miles west of my apartment (where McDonald curves around to Tatum), and it's easily accessible, although there is often a long wait for a parking spot--yes, I've waited around 30 minutes just for a spot in the poorly planned parking lot.  There are lots of people on the trail (which is okay; I sometimes prefer to have other people along side me that I can pretend to beat up the mountain...other times it's just annoying--think teenagers with their iPod speakers blasting...).    The steepest parts are toward the beginning of the hike, and there are hand rails to guide one up the tricky terrain.  There are two false summits, which I'm accustomed to (I'm from Colorado...14ers are notorious for tricking one into thinking the summit is just at the top of the hill--nope!).  For Arizona it's an excellent hike.  Don't turn back or be discouraged!  It is challenging and I've seen many people give up, but you just have to keep in mind the triumph you experience when your reach the top!!!

I'd heard some great things about FEZ and decided to give the place a try.   Atmosphere:  five stars. I call it "effortlessly trendy."  There are also a variety of seating options: the bar area, conventional dining room, patio, or comfy couches in the lounge area are all very appealing.  Some very extraverted individuals graced the bar.  Definitely a unique place AND no TVs in the bar--points in my book.  The wine list was quite expansive, and there were some creative cocktails to choose from. Plus, there's a nightly happy hour with drink specials. Saturdays are brewsky nights.   We ordered hummus and veggies. The hummus was mighty garlicky (yet incredibly tasty), and we had to order a second round of veggies. I glanced at the menu--many of the items would have hit the spot!

Amazing menu, exceptional staff, unique atmosphere....Chelsea's exceeds all expectations!  One of my top five restaurants. Ever. The restaurant reminds me of Houston's, but done MUCH better.   It's intimate, yet spacious. Classy, but not overdone. It's ideal.   The. food. is. PHENOMINAL. The menu is tied together with seafood and some Mexican dishes. In the spotlight are the tacos.  Two words:  shortrib tacos. HUGE portion of perfectly seasoned meat, guac, pico de gallo, rice and beans, with house-made tortillas on the side. You must try them!  Prior to this, my date and I were enjoying the shrimp ceviche when we see a picturesque plate of nachos presented to another table. Food envy. Yes, we are definitely coming back to sit on the patio and enjoy a gigantic plate!  I have never encountered such genuine, knowledgeable and charismatic waitstaff. I glanced over where food is prepared and I noticed each waiter carefully wiping off any splashes or splatters of foodage from each plate. This is food at it's full potential.

I like this place; I wasn't expecting the food to be good, but I was pleasantly surprised!  The service was great, and the menu was huge!  We had just missed happy hour, which was disappointing, so I had to pay the full $8.50 for a Malbec...The beer sampler looked tasty, it had six different beers in smaller glasses and came in a tray.  Next time I'm at Yard House I'm getting that.   I had edamame to start and a spinach salad for my entree.  The spinach was fresh and had the perfect amount of balsamic vinegarette.  All of the components were balanced:  candied walnuts, bleu cheese, mushrooms, spinach and croutons.  It felt complete, even without a protein.  I dream of this salad.

The coffee had just been brewed and the staff was especially helpful.   I find that people working at airport Starbucks are either very amicable and pleasant or extremely bitter. At this particular location it was the former. The cashier helped me decide what drink to order and we had a chat about the microbreweries at my destination (Denver!). Personality is a plus.   The barista poured me a sample cup of skim milk for my iced coffee--what a novel idea instead of handing over a jug!    Music was good today as well. A good spot to people watch if you have time before a flight.

Food!  Glorious food!  You're going to stuff your face at Maggiano's.   We dined at this location for a team luncheon. It's not quite beneficial to have a family-style feast of carbs, sauces, cheese and meats if you wish to be productive during the latter half of the day...But it was SO worth it! Appetizer:  stuffed mushrooms, bruschetta, and the tomato caprese. These dishes are on the oily side (in this case, oil=flavor), and it's way too easy to have one (or four) too many servings.   First course:  spinach salad, caesar salad and freshly baked bread. The salads were fresh, generously dressed and highly addictive.   Second course:  fettuccine alfredo, homestyle lasagna, chicken piccata, baked ziti, and chicken Parmesan. All of these dishes are on the heavier side, but were absolutely delicious. A little bit goes a long way!  Dessert:  chocolate zoccatto cake and apple crustada with caramel sauce served a la mode.  Who doesn't love chocolate cake or apple pie?   I could eat the apple thing alllll day long.   Is there such thing as too much deliciousness in one meal?

Chinese sounded good, what better place to satiate our craving than PF Chang's?  I always know what to expect out of the menu when dining here--the only thing that's noticeably different are the servers.  Pretty good for overall consistency.   Our server was very personable and catered to our every need.  We had the crab wontons, seared ahi tuna, and chicken lettuce wraps to start. The wontons are always sinfully delicious. The tuna was dressed with an extremely salty dressing--wayyy too salty for both our palates. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps prepared broth-velveted style, (seared with chicken broth instead of oil).  These wraps are always a winner!  The main event was orange peel chicken (it was a close call between that and sesame chicken); we chose the former because of the included veggies.  Can't decide between brown and white rice?  There's always the option of having both!  We held off on dessert, but as I recall the banana dessert is amazing (bananas wrapped in egg roll wrappers, fried to crisp perfection...I think that's what they entail...).  Beware, everything is very salty; I felt parched for days.

Delicious, authentic gelato. Enjoy as many samples as you desire!  This gelato has the consistency of American ice cream, but it's packed with more flavor. Much more flavor.   Memorable flavors include NY cheesecake, almond snickers, almond, mango, banana, forest berry, and birthday cake. The cheesecake tastes EXACLTY like the real thing--delicious!  Every cup comes with a pirouette--very unique!    My only gripe:  You can't purchase two flavors in a small cup. Only medium.  Not that I'm complaining about having MORE scrumptious gelato...  Sit on the patio, enjoy your gelato, maybe some espresso...a very pleasant way to escape.

This service sucks....Cox.  At a "discounted" rate for Internet, cable and phone I was paying $108.87 a month.  I receive a bill for the month of April:  $117.00.  In May, SURPRISE, it was $144.87.  LOVELY.    There is nothing I can do, unless I want to downgrade my Internet or remove my home phone; the latter option is not feasible because my burglar alarm works through the phone modem.  Knowing this, please don't burgle me.  Cable service isn't that great.  The TV menu sucks, and there are literally zero free "on-demand" programs.  I thought "on demand" implied "at no cost."  I guess not.  Swindlers.  I miss Comcast in Denver :-(

My first thought upon walking in:  I'm way too old to be here...but...where are the kids?  It's a Saturday night!  The arcade seemed a little dirty...there had to be better arcades nearby...  Before we headed outside to play putt putt I stopped by the ladies room. Not the cleanest establishment I've visited, and the hand dryers must have been installed over fifteen years ago. Useless.   Anyways, putt putt!  For a couple, $14.95 buys one round of mini golf. Not bad. There are three courses to choose from, each with it's own theme. We opted for the "desert" course (sorta western themed).    The course itself could use a facelift. The greens are very worn and rippled in places.  There are gashes and dents throughout the course too.    I guess I'm not quite used to the climate here in Arizona...I was disturbed by the number of cockroaches teeming the holes.  It wasn't so ladylike to shriek in front of my date as gigantic cockroaches darted in every direction...some taking flight...destination: my hair. I know the course is outside, but REALLY?!  Can't the greens be treated?  Aside from the bug problem, it really was quite fun.  Keep in mind there are many other attractions:  go-carts, water bumpers, batting cages, "bungee jumping," a driving range...  I'll keep this place in mind next time I'm bored on a weekend...although maybe not a sweltering summer day...

Booking the shuttle was easy.  I gave the sales rep my flight info and she had my ride secured within minutes. I was initially scheduled for pick up at 6, but I asked to be picked up at 5:30. No problem.   The shuttle was prompt; I was on my way to Sky Harbor by 5:40. No heavy lifting of my bag either. SuperShuttle uses propane to fuel the vans instead of gas--it's cheaper and has less emissions. I like this because I'm an environmentally-conscious individual.   The one drawback of SuperShuttle is sharing the van with other people. Luckily we only had one stop and it was relatively easy to find. Plus, it was on the way.   The driver was friendly and we listened to some good 'tunes on the way down there. A very safe ride, indeed.   Very economical--$22 each way.  It's cheaper than that obligatory meal and/or gift given to the lucky person that offers to give you a ride.   I'm satisfied.

My experience at Sally Beauty Supply exceeded my expectations.  Unlike other locations I've visited this store was organized and well-stocked.  I was greeted promptly and all of my questions were answered.  The sales associate was extremely helpful; she had extensive knowledge of the products I was inquiring about as well as the attributes of each brand.  Plus, the product that I chose was a reasonable price and satisfied my beauty needs.  I'll be back for all of my specific beauty needs!

Oh Walgreens. You have [nearly] everything I need for my health: first aid, pharmacy, bath and body products, cheap makeup...but for some reason you don't sell EAS Myoplex.   Walgreens is a little kid's paradise, with an expansive candy aisle, snack selection, flimsy toys and little gadgets.   Need some wine?  Walgreens sells wine. And some beer. This is unheard of in Colorado.   Sometimes checking out is painstakingly slow...other times it's quite speedy. You never know what new things you'll walk out with.

MAC is my go-to place for makeup.  Their product is superb and there are literally infinite ways to use the line.  The makeup artists are required to go to school for a year or so before they can work there; they know the qualities of their inventory inside and out.  The individuals working here are always very colorful and creative with their own makeup.    Sometimes it's tricky to get assistance, but if you're persistent you'll receive service relatively quickly.  Beware, these stores can be packed!  I've had my makeup done by MAC artists at other locations, and the results are usually stunning.  Of course, not all makeup artists' visions align with one's own, so be sure to speak up about what you have in mind!    Any artist prizes their tools because they can make or break a look.I use MAC brushes exclusively; the quality is absolutely exceptional and they last for YEARS.  Ask a MAC artist to help you select the essential brushes--they make all the difference in the world when it comes to applying makeup.  It's an investment that you won't regret.  Trust me.  Buy the brush cleaner as well.  There's nothing worse than getting a nasty eye infection due to a germ-infested eyeliner brush.   I'm also a loyal customer because of Back 2 Mac--their recycling program--bring in 6 empty containers to a MAC store (not a department store counter) and you'll receive an eyeshadow, lipstick or lip gloss of your choice.

I was a little skeptical about this place, especially after my wide range of Pho experiences, but Saigon Nites does Pho, and they do it WELL.  The first few minutes were a little awkward...was I expected to wait for the waitress or seat myself?  I opted to wait politely, but I found others boldly walking in and seating themselves.  Despite this little mishap, the service is great. My food came out quickly and the waitstaff stopped by a couple times during the meal.   Spring rolls and hot tea are necessary components of the Pho experience.  The jasmine tea was flavorful without a hint of bitterness.  The shrimp spring rolls were a hit; I loved the ratio of rice noodles, greens (basil and lettuce) and shrimp--not too many noodles and plenty of the good stuff.  The peanut sauce was perfection.   Better bring an appetite--the portions are gigantic!  I was promptly presented with a steaming bowl of chicken pho and I tossed in the heaping plate of bean sprouts and basil.  I'm not a fan of raw sprouts, but they come to life upon meeting the piping hot broth.  The broth had good flavor and body without being excessively oily or salty.   If you're not feeling Pho, there are plenty of Chinese items--lemon chicken, sesame chicken, beef and broccoli, chow mien, egg rolls....The list goes on and on.   All around a tasty, reasonably priced establishment.

I'm new to the area and was on a quest to find my ideal art supply store.  Jerry's Artarama lives up to my sky-high expectations (I'm an elitist when it comes to art materials...)  This place is HUGE.  You've been to Utrect?  Multiply that times six and you have Jerry's Artarama.    Not only that, but this place has about six times more inventory than their aforementioned competitor.  You're paying a few cents more on some items, but it's worth it.  Why, you ask?    Everything is nicely laid out--nothing is jammed into the space.  I felt like I could breathe as I explored aisle upon aisle of creative materials; to me, "breathing room" is essential when you're dreaming up your next creation.  No anxiety or claustrophobia here.    I'd rather pay a few cents more when I'm being helped by competent, experienced and knowledgeable artists.  Never should one walk into a store like this knowing more than the staff.  All of my questions were answered and the employees I spoke with listened as I relayed my experiences with similar products.    The brush aisle (well, aisles) is heaven on earth.  At Jerry's Artarama, you will find the largest selection of student- and artist-grade brushes ANYWHERE.  Finally, an art supplier that provides cups of water and paint for one to test the brushes before purchasing them!  (Why would you buy a car if you can't test drive it first?  Same principle.)  I noticed that there was a big space on the south side of the store for classes to be held.  This particular afternoon, an instructor was preparing for her next demonstration.  There's a different class every single day held at Artarama.  Count me in!  I left inspired and excited, but most importantly, I left feeling confident that I made the best choices possible.  Thank you Jerry's Artarama!!!

I've always been curious about Wally's; I've driven by it countless times, always thinking it to be another Zipp's-esque sports bar. I was mistaken!  Wally's is a very nice establishment; dark wood interior gives it a pub-like feel. Most impressive is the patio that seamlessly conjoins with indoor seating.  The patio is like a romantic greenhouse, minus the bugs and the heat.   The food--delicious!  Its "upscale American cuisine." I had the homemade veggie burger with a side salad in place of fries. The patty  asian-ginger glazed patty was HUGE and the bun was incredibly fresh.    The staff are prompt, friendly and helpful.  We happily sauntered out into the night after this pleasant meal.  Definitely coming back!!

"Unpretentious" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Yucca Tap Room.  There's almost a refreshing quality to this stripped down dive bar--it's the polar opposite of places you'll find in Scottsdale [sigh of relief].   The bartenders are genuine and there's always live music to keep things interesting.  I love it because there's no cover.  Ever.  Plus, diverse musical talents bring equally unique people.    The setup of the place is simple yet deliberate, with two separate "environments" to choose from (for lack of any other way to describe it).   There's a conventional 360-degree bar with stools lining the perimeter--the stage is on this side, making this the louder side of the place.  Thank goodness for the hooks lining the underside of the bar; this is the kind of place where you don't want your purse sitting on the ground.  There's a shuffle board on this side, and the door to the "patio."  By "patio", I mean a fenced-in strip of sidewalk along Southern Avenue where smokers can socialize.    On the other side of the place there's another bar, backed with an expansive selection of bottled brews.  Yes, variety is what Yucca does best.  This side has a couple pool tables and some more seating.  Ladies, I highly recommend using the restroom on this side of the place.   Don't be turned off by the first band that plays; the less talented musicians tend to play first.  Like any bar, it always gets more interesting as the night progresses.

Think of a stereotypical restaurant in Scottsdale.  Sushi Brokers is that place.  Slightly unattractive waitresses flaunting their fake tits.  A superficial crowd, filled with oogling men and scary-skinny women with fake blonde hair.      We walked in to Sushi Brokers, wanting a nice, quiet and satisfying dining experience.  I felt like I wasted an hour of my life after eating here.   You know the music is too loud when you feel the sub thumping throughout your body.  I usually don't mind louder music, but this was ridiculous.  This is no club.  It's a restaurant.  I almost asked, like a 75-year-old, for them to turn it the fuck down.  Our waitress was clearly not interested in us, and was visibly disappointed when we didn't order alcohol.  Thanks, hun.  Maybe the meal would redeem the place...but what ensued quickly shattered all hope of redemption.  NOTHING CAME OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER.  The food was SLOPPY, BLAND and STOMACH-TURNING.    Miso salad was meh--nothing memorable.  We requested steamed veggies and brown rice.  They do not serve brown rice, so don't even ask.  The veggies were overdone--no crispness whatsoever.  Onions were used as a filler between the three pieces of broccoli, mealy squash and overdone carrots.   The sushi.  As I write this i can already feel my unpleasant morning creeping up on me.  The tuna and yellowtail were warm and not the least bit fresh.  The veggie roll was bland, with a hint of something bitter.  Ew.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Didn't we order another roll?  "They have to cook the eel so it takes a while".  I've had Unagi before and it takes TWO MINUTES to cook.    After waiting 25 minutes we received our caterpillar roll and unagi.  The unagi was cold.  The roll was saturated in a gross version of eel sauce.  It was like honey.  The eel was gummy.  Avocado was not fresh, but somehow it was still green.    I made the unfortunate decision of using the restroom.  Absolutely disgusting, FILTHY.  And the music bumps up 10 decibels.  There is something so disturbingly artificial about every aspect of this place.  I will never return, even if they paid me.  A waste of calories and a HUGE waste of money.

Pascucci is a great place for a bite, brew or something sweet.  they're open late too--it's a nice place to go when you're not in the mood to go bar-hopping.  This was my second visit to Pascucci Coffee.  Once again the staff were polite, helpful and prompt.    Pascucci serves chilled blended coffees, hot coffee and a variety of espresso drinks (not as big of a selection of Starbucks, but when the quality of brew is superior this was the last thing on my mind).  I sampled a few flavors of gelato, (sugar free vanilla and chocolate--both were decadent, flavorful and didn't have an aftertaste of artificial sweetener), while I debated on my drink order.     It was a chilly  night so I opted for a coffee; my Americano was one of the best I've had.  The espresso has a slightly sweet and nutty flavor--I didn't have to add much sugar and cream to please my palette.  Absolutely no bitterness from first sip to the very last drop.  My date said that the white chocolate latte was delicious.  We savored every sip as we lounged on the covered patio.    I love this place because there are many seating options to choose from:  patio, covered patio, comfy chairs, tables, or the bar.  Plus, you can get a bite to eat too.  The menu items looked really fresh and tasty--everything in made-to-order.  Obviously, I'll be back.

Tempe Marketplace has gone down hill. It's always been impossible to navigate, and the crowds seem to grow and grow.  It's a cool concept but nothing really "wows" me about this place. The stores are typical; it takes three times longer to find what you're looking for, especially since the digital directories are frequently broken.   Aside from the navigational clusterfuck, it's gotten really dirty. I don't feel incredibly safe with the loiterers and drunks that hang out by Dave and Buster's and Cadillac Ranch either.   If I were to do an outdoor mall I'd head over to Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland instead.

"Gritty" is the word that comes to mind when I think of Conspire. It's not your typical art gallery, if you can call it a gallery at all. It reminded me of a run-down college rental, complete with a makeshift kitchen.  Don't get me wrong, I appreciate all genres of art and the effort that goes into Conspire. I'd like to see more development with the work. Maybe an installation piece...

Perhaps I have high standards or maybe I just got my hopes up after reading fellow Yelpers' reviews, but I don't feel that I got my money's worth with Ashley.   I was trying to find a new stylist after moving to Scottsdale. I have thick, wavy brown hair and my stylist back home is truly an artist with color and cuts. Incredible.   Anyways, I walk into Salon Ami, which is in an office sort of thing near Junkie and the Lodge, and was immediately baffled.   This was no traditional "salon". There was no one to greet me, so I peeked my head into one of the rooms. There were two blonde stylists in the middle of coloring their clients' hair. No introduction from short-haired blonde woman so I assumed the other one was Ashley. Was I extremely early? Did I miss something?   Nope. She would proceed to work us both at the same time. Strike one.   Ashley wanted me to tell her the exact cut I wanted as well as the colors to use, without being offered a swatch of sample colors. I'm no expert with these matters, which is why I'm entrusting an expert STYLIST to transform my vision for my hair into reality.   Maybe I should have just done the cut myself? Strike two.   We go to the sinks to wash the color out of my hair and as I'm reclining into the sink bowl I notice the ceiling is water damaged. And the conversation the co-owner was having with another employee...oh my. Yes, girls gossip. But this was beyond X-rated. Wow.  I'll let that strike slide...  Ashley puts the glaze in my hair and leaves me all by my lonesome in the sink. I know we don't know each other, but if I'm paying you for the service, the least you can do is make an effort to talk to me. Strike three.   And then the cut and style. My layers were longer on one side. The color was just ok. To top it all off, I was told I have "baby fine hair". This was news to me. Then, the bill. $160 for cut and color. Plus tip, it was around $200.   I left feeling guilty for the expense, had a mediocre cut, and was ready to try another stylist.

I like Golden Spoon.  It's no Pinkberry, but it is quite good.  I'd say it's like an upscale Dairy Queen.   Pros:   -The flavors are all really tasty--very creamy, like ice cream--the majority of which are nonfat.  -The yogurt doesn't melt into cream by the time you get home.  -The toppings bar is created to satiate a sweet tooth:  nuts, berry toppings, chocolate, hot toppings, candy, etc.  -Servings are generous and modestly priced. Even the toppings are sprinkled on heavily.   -Many sizes to choose from.   Cons: -No fresh fruit!  (luckily I always have fruit at home to add to my froyo).  -Employees swirl the yogurt and add the toppings for you (this can be nice, but in the age of Yogurtland it also seems annoying).  -No tart flavors.   The pros definitely outweigh the cons. Definitely worth a try!

Golden Spoon has an amazing product. It's truly the ice cream lover's froyo. The yogurt is creamy, flavorful and relatively nutritious. The staff are also consistently friendly and helpful.   Why the one star rating?  On a mission to satiate my cinnamon yogurt craving last weekend, I stopped by the Shea location. Some yogurt melted on my fingers while sampling--no biggie, I'd just run to the restroom.   While drying my hands, I glimpsed some movement out of the corner of my eye, so I took a closer look.  I'd like to refrain from naming the baby bugs I saw darting around; I think we all know what bug is associated with perpetual infestation.  No, I'm not referring to termites or ants.   Heart rate elevated, I took a brisk walk out to the front of the store. Passing the garbage can, directly adjacent to the yogurt machines, I spotted the one of the adult culprit(s), just chilling out and enjoying life.   I absorbed my surroundings:  the yogurt machines were covered in what looked like several days' worth of melted froyo, the floor was in dire need of a proper cleaning and the front doors were propped open. There's nothing like the smell of delicious, sugary froyo wafting out the door to invite some more "friends" into the place.   I immediately emailed the owner of this location but I have yet to hear from him/her. I can't believe I actually went though with that purchase. My stomach lurches every time I think about having a taste.   After this experience I will never go back. Ever.

Despite the bar setting, Saddle Ranch has surprisingly DELICIOUS food!  There's a huge selection of beer and cocktails (even lower-cal options) and their menu has everything from wraps to steaks.   The cornbread and biscuits were addicting--SO GOOD!  I had the southwestern chicken wrap with baked beans. The tortilla was stuffed with tender grilled chicken, romaine lettuce, pico, corn salsa and jack cheese, all in perfect proportion.  The wrap was grilled and served nice and crispy-hot.  The beans were rich and flavorful. My dad had the ahi tuna wrap--I've never seen such a GIGANTIC piece of ahi served for under $10.   Good food, fun atmosphere, very creative desserts (e.g. 3-foot cotton candy surrounded by cookies, chocolate cake, strawberries and whipped cream!)--I'll be back again and again.

I violated my rule of avoiding grocery shopping while hungry and decided to venture over to Whole Foods.  Whole Foods tends to be the indecisive individual's nightmare (that would be me).  Yet, this store is a foodie's dream.   There are aisles upon aisles of glorious, wholesome products (pun intended).  Everything is meticulously organized and there are at least ten varieties of every type of item.  No joke.  It took me fifteen minutes to decide which brand of bottled tea would be suitable (and economical).   I roamed the freshly prepared food section like a vulture circling it's prey...strategizing which choice would be the best taste sensation.  Did I want a made-to-order wrap?  Or a glass of wine and a couple tapas? (the live music was alluring)...Maybe sushi?  Pizza?  Salad bar?  Soup? Maybe something from the smokehouse...oooh! A cupcake from the cupcake bar?   On and on it went.   My final decision was sushi. The spicy tuna roll tasted fresh, and the Pacific salad roll was very crisp. I also grabbed a container of ginger for $1.99--not the artificially preserved pink variety--all-natural pickled ginger.  Bliss.  I purchased some cucumber salad from the salad bar as a side/palate cleanser. All in all, a very satisfying meal.   Prices are a tad higher than your average grocery store. Then again, it is Whole Foods. A word of advise:  come with a game plan (e.g. a shopping list). If you don't define what it is you want prior to entering this store, you'll end up spending two hours and twice as much money than you anticipated.

Five star service!  Jeanette is absolutely wonderful.  I had to drive around Ironwood Square to find the Skin Spa--look for the Center for Alternative Medicine--but once found I committed it to memory.   I was immediately welcomed by Jeanette herself. The entire place is very clean and serene; exactly what I'm looking for when it comes to waxing.   Jeanette did her absolute best to calm and relax me before, during and after my brazilian.  Not gonna lie, I was kind of freaking out...but the soothing music and relaxing decor worked wonders.  I could have taken a nap on the waxing table, it was so comfy!    Compared to other experiences getting waxed below the belt, this one was by far the least painful. I'm not saying it was a walk in the park, but it wasn't as bad as I hyped it up to be.    Jeanette is meticulous and confident in her work. Not to be too graphic, but she removed everything (there's nothing worse than enduring the pain only to get home and see stray hairs...grrrr).    I've found my go-to esthetician!  Thank you Jeanette!  Next up...some work on my brows....

I received a coupon in the mail for a free coffee and decided to see what all of the hype was about.  Walked in, and the girl working there didn't really say hello; she acknowledged my presence, but there was no audible "welcome".    I felt like an idiot.  I had obviously never been there before (there are very few Dunkin Donuts in Denver, and fried dough dunked in delicious frosting is not exactly a staple in my diet...).  I asked for an iced coffee.  Did I want cream or sugar?  Skim milk would be nice...with a little bit of half and half...but couldn't I do it myself?  I guess not.    She poured my beverage, handed it over and just stared at me.  Did I want anything else?  Umm...I had been thinking about a pound of coarsely ground coffee, but where were the prices?  I suppose the cost was irrelevant, as she informed me that there was no way of adjusting the grind of the coffee; "the machine just does it all the way".  Nevermind.    The coffee was okay.  I'm glad it was free.  I don't see myself frequenting Dunkin Donuts in the future.

Although this isn't the nicest place in the world, this is what I expect Pho to taste like.  Situated in the Mekong Plaza, the restaurant is attached an Asian market (which I wanted to explore after our meal!) and has an authentic feel to it.  We were promptly seated at a long communal table (different, but we didn't mind) and we ordered hot jasmine tea before we delved into the expansive menu.    The tea was perfect and didn't have any jasmine leaves floating it (at Pho An Sen I was slighly irritated by this)--definitely my kind of tea.  We ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pork to start.  I loved the warm tender shrimp and the crisp, fresh veggies.  They were served with peanut dipping sauce, and we experimented with the three sauces that were on our table (red chili sauce, hoisin sauce, sriacha).    The menu was organized by broth: beef-based, chicken and pork-based, and regional flavors.  The server (I think he was the owner) asked if it was our first time eating Pho and took the time to explain the flavors of all of the broths.  I decided on the Pho with sliced chicken breast (it was listed under the beef-based section, although it was more of a rich chicken broth), and ordered it with bok choi, mushrooms, and broccoli.  It came with a side of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeno, lime and basil.  The broth was complex, yet it had clarity to it.  It wasn't too oily (I HATE greasy-tasting Pho) and the chicken was lean.  Our server even showed us how to make the perfect dipping sauce (half hoisin, half sriacha and a squeeze of lime).   My friend ordered the beef-based #3.  It was spiced perfectly, came out piping hot and wasn't loaded with fatty meat.  He ordered slices of rare beef on the side, which were very lean and incredibly tasty.    On taste and service alone, I would have given unPhogettable five stars.  However, they closed at 9 on a Saturday night, and began to close up shortly after.  One of the waitresses propped open the door to shake out all of their floor mats.  This pissed me off because it was rainy and COLD outside, and it made both me and my Pho cold.  They started mopping and stacking the chairs before we even had a chance to pay.  It was like we were inconveniencing them for lingering at their restaurant.  This is one thing I HATE.  Paying customers have the right to linger as long as they want after a meal, even if it's for merely 10 minutes after closing time.

Slathered in sunscreen and equipped with a water bottle and sketchbook, I ventured out to the Old Town Farmer's Market to experience one of my favorite summer traditions.  Luckily, I attended one of the last outdoor markets before transitioning inside for the scorching summer.  Located on the southwest corner of Brown Avenue and First Street, the venue is easily accessible and provides an ideal place for locals and tourists to mingle with regional business owners and popular restaurateurs.   Come hungry and open-minded:  every merchant doles out generous samples of their product (with the exception of the organic produce stand), tempting potential buyers to hand over the cash.  I enjoy visiting each week to sample popular dishes from the ever-changing lineup of restaurants.   For those looking for a meal, food stands and local restaurants also set up shop.  My senses were tempted by the colorful tuna tartar nachos and smoky beef tenderloin kebabs from the folks at Eddie's House; I contemplated spending my "happy calories" (those reserved for high-cal splurges) on a cheesy, crispy green chili cheddar chicken melt at the Orange Table stand.   Customers continue to come back each week to sample popular dishes from the ever-changing lineup of restaurants.  The majority of the organic produce is cheaper elsewhere, prompting the need for some detective work at natural foods stores like Whole Foods, Sprouts and Sunflower Market prior to making a purchase.  Splurge on items that are unique to the market:  rare mushrooms, specialty olive oils, uniquely flavored jams and jellies, and the like.   Visitors are bound to find something that they simply can't live without; whether with the family, significant other, or arriving solo, the market has something for everyone.

Finally!  I've found a bar where I can feel at home.   Walk on up the staircase and you're transported into a refreshingly unpretentious universe.  The furniture is refined. The space is very unique.  I immediately felt relaxed and at ease among the eclectic crowd.   As an artist, I always appreciate spaces that support the local art scene. Sidebar does it right by having opening night festivities complete with a deejay.  It's not PACKED with pieces either.  Work is arranged to have a big impact. There's even digital light art. How I love post-modernism!!!    Drinks are poured generously and there's a nice selection of liquors along a gleaming, golden backdrop.   However, when you order a non-alcoholic beverage it's served in a plastic red cup. Call me picky, but is it so much to pour my diet coke in a normal glass like everyone else?

The first time I experienced the Lodge I really enjoyed it (I'm somewhat partial since it's vaguely reminiscent of a bar back home in Vail or Beaver Creek). I enjoy the happy hour menu with staples like mac n' cheese, veggies and dip, sandwiches and burgers (all are surprisingly delicious). Plus there are games to keep one occupied:  darts, billiards, that sandbag toss game, and gigantic Jenga (my favorite).   One word of advice: be specific with your drink order; don't ask the bartender for a cab (as in the wine Cabernet)--they'll tell you the cabs are outside. Or maybe I'm just the only one who orders wine at a bar.

I hated food in terminal 3...that is, until I gave Paradise a shot.   The staff were incredibly friendly; the sandwich maker even created my California turkey exactly as I requested: pesto mayo and ranch on the side, with extra veggies.  The bread was incredibly fresh and the veggies were crisp. The turkey was so-so...nothing special. The pesto mayo made the sandwich. Plus, it came with a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie.   A great place for a quick, healthy bite before a flight.

Yogurtology is a franchise--each one has it's own unique twist. I really wasn't blown away with this location.    The flavors are okay...I liked the NSA flavor best, which is unusual when it comes to froyo. Most disappointing was the oatmeal cookie--my go-to flavor. It was WAYYYYY too sweet and had a slimy consistency after it quickly melted.  I think they were trying to outdo it with the cookie flavor and doubled up on ingredients. Not such a good outcome. My tummy didn't thank me.   The toppings bar is expansive. Having the fruit placed before the candy is a perk.   The staff act like they're too good to be working here. Even the guy who rang us up wouldn't make eye contact.  He scoffed at me when I said I was part of the loyalty program at another Yogurtology.  Ummm, maybe you could add me to your "program" and I'd come back next time.  No "thank you" either.  No thank you to this location.

We drove around Tempe Marketplace looking for Mojo yogurt for a good 10 minutes, trying to pinpoint its exact location from the Yelp map and directions.  We finally decided to ditch the directions and get out of the car and walk around the outdoor mall to find it.  We spotted a family eating out of Mojo containers and asked them for directions.  Just down the way, near Kabuki.    Tempe Marketplace is really cool!  I'm from Colorado and so the outdoor mall thing hasn't exaclty caught on (going shopping outside isn't exaclty appealing when it's freezing).  Since it was nighttime it was nice to sit by one of the fireplaces and take in the palm trees lit with colored lights.    Mojo was okay.  Why is it so dimly lit?  Why weren't there more than 6 chairs inside the place?  I was expecting more flavors than 6...they do provide tasting cups by the yogurt machines so you don't have to be rationed on your samples (a plus).  The sugar free blueberry was good, as was the "white boy vanilla", but I decided on cheesecake and cookies and cream.  The mango wasn't good...dairy free and kinda blah...They have a selection of toppings, but don't expect as much of a variety as Yogurtland.  I'm still looking for a REALLY good alternative to Yogurtland (and Pinkberry has yet to come to Arizona...sad)...Mojo just wasn't it.

Second time visiting Mojo. We discovered how horrible the setup of the place is when there's a crowd (i.e. More than 4 people in line). The line backs up and people get annoyed as they try to squeeze in for their samples. I received several dirty looks from other customers when I had finally decided on a flavor to purchase.   The toppings bar was sloppy; candy was scattered everywhere and they were completely out of fruit. I felt bad for the sole employee working. Not only was the line backed up, but she had to tidy up the place all by herself.   After eating some of the yogurt outside we decided to get lids. Sole employee was finally getting a chance to clean up a bit, and when we asked for lids she grudgingly sighed and didn't even say "thank you". I blame her predicament on the owner/management who decided it would be cheaper to run the place with one employee. Not only does it reflect bad management, but this poor girl seemed to hate her life. Not exactly an uplifting experience.

I decided to give Mojo Yogurt another try.  I've never been a fan of Mojo, and last night cemented my displeasure.    We walked in around 10:30 pm on a Saturday and found three young employees screwing around.  I was a teenager once (I suppose we all were...), but even then I knew what constituted "professional" behavior.  I was in a good mood, so I was willing to overlook this...but at this time, they just happened to be emptying out the trays that catch the melted yogurt.    Never in my life have I been more disgusted.  Even the three girls were grossed out as they poured the brown, chunky liquid into the trash cans.  There was melted refuse on the floor and splashed on the machines.  Their explanation?  "It's that time of the night!"  I tried to look away but I couldn't seem to get the image out of my mind.  I had a sample or two but my stomach started to rumble.  I looked over to the toppings bar and realized that I didn't trust what they were serving.  If the health department walked in this place, it would have been shut down immediately.    The yogurt machines do not have any special plastic tips to make the yogurt flow out in a three-dimensional star pattern; the yogurt comes out of the machine in a cylindrical shape--strikingly similar to a solid turd.  Sucks to be a chocolate fan!   I looked at my friend and we silently eyed the door; I couldn't bring myself to purchase food from such an unkempt establishment.  We quickly hurried out and headed to Yogurtland back in Scottsdale.  Thank goodness there are a plethora of reputable, clean yogurt shops elsewhere!

Oh American Apparel. I want to like you, but your smug employees and weird-fitting clothing just don't do it for me. And I can't help but notice the people who frequent the store take on this smug quality as well.   Every single over-priced basic tee or tank I've purchased has fallen apart, stains easily and shrinks in odd ways after every wash.   There are a couple exceptions: the basic u-neck tanks, v-neck tees and headbands. However, I can find better quality (and less expensive) garments at Target.   Maybe if there was a sale every now and then I'd have a soft spot for American Apparel. This convention has yet to be introduced to this retailer.

Oh my goodness!  I LOVE the Gelato Maker!  It's right by where I work and we head over here every Friday afternoon for a treat.  During my first visit I had no clue what flavor to choose; they have a HUGE selection of gelato.  Everything from Reeses to Ferraro Rocher, mango to black cherry.  They gladly gave me samples of every single flavor--close to 20 samples!  After much contemplation, they told me I could get two flavors in one cup for the same price.  That doubled my options of amazing taste sensations!  By the time my colleagues were nearly finished with their treats I finally decided on half mango (which is made with 65% fresh mango) and half coconut.    The flavors are true to their names; the mango tasted like I was eating a juicy mango, snickers tasted like a snickers bar, and the nougat tasted like the most delicious part of a Tolberone chocolate bar.  I'm blown away.  Visiting the Gelato Maker is the best part of my work week, and I know I can always  sample any flavor that I don't order just to satiate my indecisive palate.

I was on a mission to find a birthday present for my mom, so I gave Steinmart a shot.  Tucked away in the center by Bamboo Club and Chili's, it doesn't look too bad from the outside.    I walked in, took about 30 paces, and was overcome with an overwhelming sense of depression.   I spotted some jeggings and muumuus on racks that were awkwardly high for the place...this store is not well-planned.    As claustrophobia sank in, I glanced around for home wares and spotted a tiny little section by the main entrance.  They had a couple grill racks and some tacky, kitschy knick-knacks.  I think not.    I high-tailed it out of there, increasingly relieved as I made progress toward my car.

Great place for a quick, healthy bite, featuring flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups...even quesadillas!  No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item).   I devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco.   It would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.  Beat that, Subway!

I'm always on a mission to try something unique, and tonight I found another AMAZING restaurant:  The Parlor.  Boy, it's one exquisite pizza parlor!!!  As we sauntered out of the restaurant, the herb and vegetable garden caught our attention, then I recalled the pleasant aromas of basil and sage that piqued our senses upon entering.  Take a moment to "oooh" and "aaah" at the massive plants of basil, squash, sage and the like lining the main entrance.    Lacquer-painted white brick, warm wood and metals complement The Parlor's deconstructed vibe. The staff are incredibly honest, helpful and accommodating.  The food may seem simple, consisting mainly of salads, pizza and pastas, but the flavor in each dish is delightfully complex and thoughtfully balanced.  It's perfection.  I had the small spinach salad to start.  This was topped with white balsamic vinaigrette, white cheddar, julienned radish, and hard boiled egg.  Incredibly fresh!    We found it difficult to settle on an entree; did we want pasta?  Maybe a wood-fired pizza?  Or a burger?  There's always the option of building your own pizza...Our waiter kindly steered us in the right direction.  My date had the burger with aged cheddar and I had the spicy barbeque chicken pizza.    This PIZZA!!!  House-made barbeque sauce dressed the slightly chewy (yet crisp) crust, along with provolone, serrano chilies, roasted chicken, grilled scallions and cilantro.  As previously mentioned, the flavors are deliberate--each ingredient proudly hits your taste buds in every bite.  It's heaven.    We were tempted by the dessert menu but decided to stick with coffee.  I had a single decaf french press.  Another simple pleasure to conclude our excellent meal.    Oh yes, I will be back.

I've never been a fan of Albertsons.  There's just something about the store that makes me hate my life. It's unnecessarily depressing.   The produce is unimpressive, prices are higher than most places, and the store is laid out in a bizarre way.  It's understaffed, and the staff that are working seem unhappy. Smile!  I always end up frustrated with the slow self-checkout lanes (I'm referring to the slow computers...not people).   I'll stop by this store when I'm in a pinch and don't have time to run to Safeway or Sprouts.

I was gifted a Groupon for 10 one-on-one boxing session, which said to call the gym, schedule and appointment and mention my Groupon.  I had some trouble getting a response--I called and left a couple messages and I sent an email.  I received two calls a couple days later.  I got the impression that there isn't one person who books sessions (I later found out that the trainers work independently).    I was a little nervous to start this type of training, but after Peter's warm welcome I began to feel more at ease.  I let him know that I don't feel comfortable having anyone punching toward my face or body, and he promised that he'd be extra careful when the time came.    After wrapping my hands up Peter had me warm up.  The first time I did a simple block-running exercise, where I discovered I'm not as agile as I thought!  The second session I did pushups VEEEERRRY slowly in three different hand positions.  Incredibly effective in getting my heart rate up.    The first session is all about technique.  I learned the proper way to stand, cross and jab, and how to hold my body.  It's a lot harder than it looks!  I was instructed to ice anything that ached.  My hands were a little sore the next day, so I took a couple Advil and iced away.    The second session we actually got to go in the boxing ring!  I had been practicing; Pete could tell, and he was excited about this.    Glove Game is not your typical fancy-shmancy Scottsdale gym.  It's a place where you can be yourself and where your trainer pushes you to the limit.  There is this energy that happens when you're training; you are focusing so hard on your body's movements that the world disappears around you--only you and the trainer exist.  I'm very much looking forward to my next 8 sessions, and the ones I intend to purchase in the future.

Yogurtland never disappoints.  There are always a couple new flavors to try and it's always hard to decide which one (or combination) to go with because they're all so good.  My only qualm is the size--large or extra large.  It's incredibly hard to restrain oneself from filling the large cup to the brim.   Deciding what to get is the biggest obstacle:  Do I want açai berry topped with granola, fresh strawberries, blueberries and mango? Or do I want a swirl of red velvet cake batter and cheesecake batter covered in cookies 'n cream candy, with a dash of graham cracker crust and chocolate chips? Blueberry tart topped with a swirl of vanilla wafer, mochi and berries?  Decisions...  Maximizing your yogurt experience, the diverse selection of toppings: fresh fruit (sometimes which run out before I get there...mango hoarders), candy, cereal, nuts and syrups.   Best of all, prices are incredibly reasonable. Yogurtland has an effective concept which keeps me coming back again and again.

After a year with LA Fitness it's time to say sayonara. The great thing about this gym are the regulars. It's always nice to see a familiar face (or faces).   The bad thing about this gym (one of many flaws) is the volume of the regulars. It's not really a friendly place when you're sending hateful vibes to that one guy who always hogs the StairMaster.   I quickly learned that the sales reps earn commission to produce as many memberships as possible. They stay at work until they've signed up a minimum of five people. Why do you think the space allocated to the sales reps is so big?  There are "one weekend only" specials every single weekend. Just another ploy to convert more innocent inquirers into customers.   The staff?  Well, don't expect much of an intelligible answer from anyone at the front desk. They proudly state that they don't have any knowledge about the gym or it's classes.  Their sole duty is scanning barcodes.  And that's what you are--just another barcode.   The volume of people kills this place. The machines are run down, they're frequently breaking, and there's barely enough room to breathe.  In a sea of cologne, hair gel and plastic, the claustrophobia is intensified.   Locker rooms are stocked with paper towels. That's it. I've heard disgusting stories about the men's locker room. Enough said.  Classes...they're not bad. However, they're frequently overcrowded. Pilates with Sarah was enjoyable.   The lack of parking sent me over the edge. Circling the lot for 15 minutes isn't exactly a promising way to get into a workout mindset. It's more of an erratic, "I'll kill you for that spot" mindset. Not conductive to a healthy lifestyle.   Bottom line:  I was fed up.  People who go here think its THE gym to go to, but in reality they're being severely ripped off.   Don't fall into the trap.

I pulled up to Lightning Lube around 5:45 pm on a Saturday and was immediately greeted by one of the owners. Never had I received such prompt attention from an auto repair shop!  I was afraid that they wouldn't be able to do the job since I was cutting it so close to 6 (when they close on Saturdays), but I was reassured that they definitely had time.   Service was quick and thorough, and as I was waiting another customer told me how Lightning Lube was the best auto place in town; not once did they try to jack up prices or throw in unnecessary parts/services to the tab.   Instead of the typical "oh you need a new filter" [just trust me] scenario, I was shown my actual air filter, which clearly needed to be replaced. With the Yelp discount the total bill was $21 (not including the $24 air filter, which I was not pressured in to purchasing).   Overall an extremely reasonable, FAST, and quality service with a matter-of-fact, pressure-free approach. Screw the dealer, I'll be coming back for my new air filter and oil changes!

I'm torn on this business--good location (although parking is sometimes impossible), reasonable prices, prompt service, and they offer salon services (which I have yet to try); on the other hand the staff doesn't deliver consistent, friendly service.  The last couple times I visited Bronze Boutique the sign saying "This Bed Has Been Sanitized" was not present, nor were the eye protectors or towel.  I haven't received a "thank you" upon exiting the store. Overall, it's a less than satisfying experience.  I don't get overly excited about coming here.

A swanky, cozy place to land right in the heart of Old Town. Yes, Mabel's is the place to be seen.  It's an establishment striving to exude class and wealth. It's old fashioned done well.   I don't have much to say about the cocktails since I don't drink anymore, but the bartenders were attentive nonetheless.  It's an ideal place to cozy up to your honey or eye that sexy someone across the room.

I'm impressed. My clothes are fresh and clean. Properly pressed, no holes from safety pins--in fact, Continental Cleaners does not use safety pins--and no gross chemical dry cleaning smell.   A painless experience: the attendant was friendly and made note of my garment preferences. (Delicate cycle ONLY for items that Seville Cleaners had nearly destroyed).   Fast turn-around:  I dropped off my garments on a Tuesday night after 5, and they were ready the next day after 5.    Plus, prices are very reasonable. I was expecting to pay a lot more, but my bill was $20.50: $2 for each of my skirts and $2.50 for my nice shirts and sweaters.    Such a relief to have a dependable dry cleaner.  It's a little hard to find...it's just east of the Chevron.

I had been putting off my appointment for three weeks, thanks to the ease of scheduling and rescheduling online--it's as easy as entering your contact and insurance info and selecting a time.   But I HAD to do it eventually...damn primary care physicians....  I don't exactly look forward to having blood drawn at 8 am, especially after fasting for 12 hours, but I was quickly put at ease by the relaxed and confident medical assistant. He was very personable and got my mind off of the vials of blood being extracted from my body. I was bandaged up and ready to go in no time.   If your doctor ever orders lab work, I HIGHLY recommend taking that order to LabCorp. Professional, efficient, personable and relatively painless.

Ah yes, the Post Office.  Usually I loathe going to the Post Office:  long lines, grumpy employees, impatient patrons...you know what I mean.   I stopped by the Hopi Station Post Office one morning before work to drop off my Mother's Day package and was pleasantly surprised.  The line was very short; only one man was in front of me.  Even though there was only one postal employee working the counter I waited no longer than two minutes.  The post lady (yes, I still refer to postal employees as the "post man/lady") was very helpful and recommended the best way to ship my package. I was in, out and on my way.  And my package arrived two days earlier than expected.  Now I know the Post Office isn't so bad as I thought...at least not this location.

Need to get rid of a few old kick-knacks?  Some old clothes or an eyesore of a machine?  No worry, drop it off to Goodwill donation Center.   The location is extremely convenient, located in the southwest corner of the Fry's center; it's even open until 6 pm on Sundays.   All you need to do is pull up and wait for an attendant to come out to your car.  No hassle.  Need a receipt?  Then you re on your way...

I've never had a consistent experience at Kinko's. The employees are incompetent and the rates for simple services like scanning and faxing are ridiculously expensive.    I stopped by this location to scan and email some documents. I wanted to use a self-serve computer and scan them myself, as these were confidential papers.   The attendant insisted the most "cost-effective" means of accomplishing my goal was for her to scan them, put them on a thumbnail drive to upload to the computer, convert to PDF and email.   She was rude and defensive when I insisted I do it my way (after all, I have done this many times at different locations, and I am a PAYING CUSTOMER).   Instead of paying for the $0.25/minute (or something close to this rate) to use the computer and quickly scanning the pages myself, I paid around $1.10/page for her to scan the doc in addition to the fee for the computer.  I'd rather buy my own scanner/fax than have to deal with Kinko's.

I love Yogurtology because every location has a slightly different twist on the high-quality flavors and toppings.  The staff at this location were incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic.  The guy who was swirling samples gave some interesting details about how their yogurts are made.    The oatmeal cookie is OUTRAGEOUSLY AMAZING at this location.  It's the closest thing to actually eating an oatmeal cookie--thick, creamy and rich.  Chocolate peanut butter and fabulous flan were also incredibly tasty.    They have a few toppings at the beginning of the line:  brownies, marshmallow oatmeal cookie sandwiches, granola and oreos.  Put these in before you dispense your yogurt to mix up your taste sensation.    The hallmark of Yogurtology is the extensive toppings bar.  It was kept immaculately clean at this location, something I really appreciate.  Some unique toppings included raisins, cotton candy crumble, chocolate logs and crumbled Butterfinger.  Sadly, there's no hot fudge or caramel at this location.    I'll definitely stop by again if I'm in the area!

Out of all the froyo shops opening up, this is my least favorite.  The setup was predictable, the flavors weak.  Of course we weren't allowed to get samples ourselves, and we had to ask for someone to help us out.  I felt like I ruined the girl's day by asking for more than two samples.    The toppings bar seemed dirty.  I felt like I was going to catch a virus from the fruit, which looked like it was leftover from the day before.  I had no clue which type of chocolate chips I chose--the hand-written labels were in groups of three along the back row.  Confusing.    I'm glad we didn't have to pay full price--thank you Yelp check-in offer!  One thing I did like were the chairs outside of the place.  Perfect to sit and have a good conversation with a friend.    I'm not going out of my way to come back here.

This was the only nail salon open on Sunday with decent reviews, and since I was starting a new job (and it was my birthday) I decided to make the 10 minute drive for some much needed pampering.   I was promptly seated at a pedicure station with Jimmy (I like how they told me his name; it made the experience more personal). He brought me a cold bottle of water, a variety of magazines and showed me a detailed service list. And yes, the hot stone massage made ALL the difference for $3 extra. My pedi looks perfect.   I had a basic manicure and Jimmy thoroughly shaped my nails, trimmed my cuticles, and painted flawless French tips. I accidentally chipped a nail before paying and they kindly fixed the smudge (I HATE it when a nail tech scoffs at me for my clumsiness and impatience).  The one thing I that bothered me was when I used the restroom....there were heaps of wash cloths and hand towels soaking in the sink, preventing anyone who used the bathroom from washing their hands. This got me thinking about sanitation...do they have a washing machine? Do they do this often? Do the nail techs thoroughly wash their hands? These thoughts I don't want to entering my head while getting a beauty service.

On the surface, Renegade is an exorbitant establishment. The decor is excessive, embellished and meticulously planned. Every detail is included, from the wine cellar to the open-air bar, dining room and private banquet rooms...it's very impressive.   I'll say the Yelp cliche:  I wanted to love it. I really did. I just wasn't impressed with the quality of the food. The menu is quite limited yet seems excessive...Too much to decipher, yet not enough selection.   Don't even try to abide by your diet when eating here. Normal rules of portion control and calorie limitations are thrown out the window.  Even the healthiest dish (a small spinach salad) is topped with a coddled egg--an over-easy egg yolk ready to ooze all over the baby spinach.  The dressing?  A "cider vinegarette" (also called the honey-bacon dressing). Pure oil with bacon on the bottom.  Absolutely zero resemblance to a vinegarette.    The chicken and roasted pepper flatbread was the highlight of the meal. Not too spicy, just the right texture...lavish amounts of cheese.  It was divine.   My date had the "award winning" RC Burger. I had a bite and felt greasy all over.  I hate that feeling. Had they seasoned the meat (e.g. salt and pepper), it might've been better. The pretzel bun looked yummy, but it didn't stand up to the 3/4 lb patty and fixings. The best part of the matchstick fries was the ketchup. Good ol' Heinz never let's me down!   The waitress was friendly but the service wasn't remarkable. Everyone seemed to have their noses too high to care, including the employees.    It's your typical Scottsdale Restaurant:  exhaustively pretentious with relatively bland offerings.

We'd driven from Scottsdale to try Pizza Bianco, which had a two hour wait; we looked around the immediate vicinity and saw Nobuo right across the way. I Yelped it, skimmed the reviews, and we decided to give it a go.    Named after the chef and owner, Nobuo, the menu frequently changes to compliment the fresh fish imported from Japan.   The restaurant is located in a restored historical building called the Teeter House. The decor is of nouveau elegance; the wood floors, warm-colored walls and refined decorative touches make for a very unique setting. Nobuo collects art and ceramics from around the world; I enjoyed the meal even more by simply taking in the beautiful artwork.  Each dish is smaller (tapa-sized) but packs a lot of flavor!  I like this because it allowed us to try several items from the impressive menu.  We started with Kimchi (napa cabbage, dried shrimp, sesame oil, red chili) and Sugar Snap Pea, coated with sesame dressing and bonito. Kimchi had just the right balance of sweet and savory, and the red chili added an enjoyable amount of heat.   Next came tuna flown in fresh from Japan, served sashimi style. The portion was generous and the quality exquisite. I wish it came with ginger!!  (No shaved ginger in-house, which was disappointing)   Third round was the Shiromi Carpaccio. A server brought out a plate of chilled white fish called yuzu, sprinkled with garlic, and chili flakes.  Hot sesame oil was poured on top, sizzling to slightly sear the fish.  This dish could have been spicier.  After we finished the fish the server brought out thinly sliced rounds of soft, house-made foccacia to dip in the sesame oil mixture.    Next came Ebi Salad--grilled shrimp skewers atop a bed of rice noodles, purple basil, mint, cucumber, soy glazed peanuts and nuoc cham. The salad was cool and refreshing, and the tender shrimp had just the right amount of heat.   The grand finale were the Pork Belly Buns--braised pork belly, hoisin sauce and pickled mustard greens tucked inside a delightfully chewy steamed bun made with rice flour. Perfection!  We finished the meal with one of the six green teas available. The toasted rice that steeped with the herbs created robust and balanced flavor.   All around a refreshing and satisfying adventure of Japanese flavors. Incredible.  I will forever remember this meal.

After my first visit, I fell in love with JJ's Delicatessen.  Everything is made-to-order with quality ingredients.  My boyfriend and I stopped by one Sunday morning for some breakfast.  Everything on the expansive menu sounded delicious.  JJ's serves breakfast  (skillets, eggs, pancakes, french toast, omelettes, pastries, etc), lunch and other savory deli items (knish, challah...).   Place your order at the counter, grab some coffee and find a seat inside or on the patio.  I ordered an egg white Greek omelette with fresh fruit and a whole wheat bagel (the options included potatoes or fruit and bagel or toast).  My honey had two eggs with fruit and a side of buttermilk pancakes.   Our food arrived within minutes of finding a spot on the patio.  What impressed me most about JJ's is the quality of the food.  When ordering an egg white omelette you'd expect less eggs and more veggies than your typical "whole-egg" omelette.  Not so at JJ's.  The veggies were fresh and the egg whites were plentiful.  I finally found a place that caters to my health-nut tendencies without skimping on quantity or flavor.  Did I mention the buttermilk pancakes are phenomenal?  JJ himself was helping customers, busing tables and even moving in heating lamps for the chilly patron.  It was nice to have our needs met by the owner himself.  Amazing food, service and down-to-earth atmosphere.  I will be back!

I was in dire need of new tennis shoes and did not know where to go.  I was last fitted at my beloved Boulder Running Company in Colorado and was afraid that I wouldn't find a decent store around town.  Little did I know Sole Sports would be my new go-to for athletic shoes.    Sole Sports is a small shop tucked away in the corner of the Albertson's center, off Hayden and Indian Bend. I walked in and the sole employee was helping a couple by the treadmill.  Then Matt walked out, very apologetic that he didn't see me.    My perception changed quickly.  Both of the guys who work there are incredibly knowledgeable and very friendly and instead of waiting for one customer to be done before I could be helped, they worked with a couple patrons at a time.    I usually detest this sort of thing when it comes to this type of store, but both sales reps there weren't just "going through the motions"; they were genuinely concerned about our needs and they took the time to speak with each one of us.  Multitasking at its best (in a good way).    Matt helped me get some new Asics, and he brought out a couple other pairs that were comparable to the shoe I had my eye on.  I laced them up, and was encouraged to run around outside to see how they felt.    Sole Sports has a treadmill and video recording system for shoe fittings.  If you're not sure what shoe would be best, or even if you're looking for a new pair, they'll start with a neutral shoe, get you on the treadmill and record your stride.  Working off of this, they'll set you up with the proper shoe, each time recording a jog on the treadmill.  Even as a sports/health junkie, I never knew what shoe was best or how it should feel.  The video recording solved my shoe woes; I now know exactly what type of athletic shoe is best for me.    This is definitely not a discount retail store, but if you're serious about running (or even being active), quality shoes are VERY important.  Whether you're looking for shoes just for the gym, or are a serious runner, Sole Sports will have the shoe for you.    Sole Sports even has group runs every weekend, and they invited me to join them.  Plus, I can donate my old tennis shoes to those who can't afford shoes.  Walking out of the store, I had a really good feeling about my purchase and the overall experience.

Good location in the AJ's center.  It's Starbucks-esque, with a couple comfy chairs and a few tables, plus plenty of outside seating by a relaxing fountain.    I had a grande caffe mocha with sugar free chocolate syrup.  After walking out I realized I didn't ask for nonfat.  I decided to go back and see if they could rectify the situation...the barista gladly remade my drink free of charge, let me taste the difference (in the end they were the same), and let me keep both.    I'll be back to try their teas!

Second time around, I decided on a grande iced Americano.  I felt bad because the barista was the only one working, and a line quickly formed with hurried business people.  I had to wait longer than I'd prefer at 8 am on a Friday morning.  Seriously, shouldn't there be more employees during peak hours?    The Americano itself was filled with too much ice, and even after I doctored it up with some cream and Splenda, it tasted overwhelmingly bitter.  I added more cream when I got to the office, but the bitterness was still there in full-force.  I understand that espresso turns bitter within a few minutes, but I've ordered Americanos before and they usually don't taste THAT bitter.  I much prefer AJ's iced Americano over Tully's; not only does it taste better, but it's cheaper per ounce.  And there are multiple people working so you don't have to wait as long.    I'm sorry Tully's, I guess I'll just stick to the sugar free iced mocha.

I've been away from the Old Town bar scene for a few months now, and I decided what better place to make my comeback than Firehouse.  Firehouse was one of my favorite spots in Old Town.  I've spent many, many drunken nights dancing my booty off at this bar.  If you get tired of waiting for drinks at the front bar, try your luck at the back.  Sometimes the service is faster, and you never know who you'll run into on the way over there.   Anyways, this particular occasion I was coming out to watch the Pacquiao fight with some buddies from my boxing gym.  What better place to watch a fight than a place like Firehouse?!  We had a reserved table--the best spot in the house!  Waitresses buzzed around us, bringing food, pitchers of water and checking to see if anyone needed a refill from the bar, all while being careful not to block our view of the fight.  Very impressive.  And they're dressed so damn cute.  We were treated like kings (or just high-rolling VIPs).   After the fight the usual set of songs and music videos came on, and I remembered why I usually moved on to the next bar after an hour or so.  Some new music would definitely keep me in the place longer, but I can't complain.   All in all, a great night.

I give Mix n Lix five stars for the flavor and consistency of the yogurt. The owner swirled samples for me as he explained that they don't use any powders to create their flavors. Five stars for his zeal and passion for the product.   The yogurt itself is thick, creamy and incredibly tasty. Tart is a little too tart for my palette; it's made with Greek yogurt. I can't get enough of the chocolate and vanilla!!!  Cake batter is spot-on as well.   Three stars for the space itself. The toppings are divided, with one bar adjacent to the beginning of the line and another at the end...this setup is something new, maybe not the most convenient.  I like the gigantic spoons for to dole out the toppings. It was much easier to load up on the goodies without sugary morsels flying everywhere.   Four stars for ingenuity of toppings--chocolate-covered doughnut holes?!  Yes, please!

Same concept as Yogurtland, except they insist on swirling your samples for you. This detracted from the whole "do it yourself" vibe; I felt like I was inconveniencing them for wanting to try more than 3 samples.   There was less of a flavor selection than Yogurtland but the ones they had were incredibly tasty--oatmeal cookie, snickerdoodle, mango, red velvet cake, even birthday cake!  The toppings area is well kept and has a diverse selection of fruit, nuts, cereal and candy.  I'd come back.

I don't know why I waited so long to visit Yogurtology; it's located conveniently next to my Safeway.  Why did i wait so long?!  Yogurtology has perfected self-serve froyo.  The flavors are spot-on...lemon meringue, birthday cake, NSA coffee, peach mango tart, cheesecake, mango, rootbeer...the list goes on...I always end up getting oatmeal cookie.  It's made in-house with real oatmeal cookies.  We're talking oatmeal cookie literally IN the froyo, none of that artificial flavor crap.  It is incredible.    Instead of having little placards for the flavors, there are digital Sony TV screens that describe each flavor and a brief nutritional run-down.  Very high-tech!  The selection of toppings is unparalleled--baklava, three different kinds of twix and milky way, brownie, chocolate chip cookie bar, chocolate covered waffle cone, premium fruit and nuts...anything you can imagine, Yogurtology has it.    Not only that, but the shop is impeccably clean, and the staff are consistently cheerful.  This place blows Yogurtland and Yogurtopia AND all other Yogurtology locations out of the water!!!  This is where you want to go.

Upon walking into the Spotted Donkey one is welcomed by the warm,  upscale decor. The hostess asked it we would prefer the dining room or lounge, and since we didn't have a preference we were seated in the lounge. The chairs were large and pillowy; perfect for a cozy feast of Mexican fare.   Chips and salsa did not grace the meal, but they were on the appetizer menu for around $6, as was guac for $9.50. I think the waiter would have been more attentive had we ordered drinks; the service was provided on circumstance (I say this because there were older couples and a table of women in their 20s who were showered with attention--I felt neglected before our food even came out).  The food:  OUTSTANDING. I had the chicken fajitas--the sauce (oh my!) was uniquely delicious and addicting; I found myself scraping the cast iron skillet with every scrap of tortilla I had left. Fajitas were accompanied by fresh guacamole, salsa, sour cream and warm flour tortillas. My friend had the steak tacos. They were the perfect size, had just the right amount of cabbage for crunch and the beef had a nice smoky taste. The salsa and guac really pushed the flavors to perfection.   All around a pleasant dining experience. I'm coming back for their late night happy hour menu!

TCBY has been around much longer than any of the froyo places that are springing up on nearly every street corner.  There was a TCBY not far from my parents' house in Denver--the TCBY I grew up with.  Sadly, it went out of business many years ago.    I would always get this blizzard-like creation (think:  Dairy Queen, but creamier), made with vanilla frozen yogurt and cookie dough bites.  As of now, I'm much more of a plain froyo person, and I was excited to experience TCBY again.    High school kids do the work, but they did a great job.  I sampled the NSA butter pecan, peanut butter and white chocolate frozen yogurt.  The flavor profiles are a lot less aggressive than your typical froyo place, but are much creamier.  I chose vanilla and purchased a pint for $4.49 sans toppings--cheaper than any froyo place in town in terms of price per ounce.    TCBY has a limited selection of toppings, but I did see some capsules filled with different supplements--something that I do not remember them to have when I was a little girl.  There are about a dozen flavors of ice cream in addition to the waffle bowls and cones that I love.  Smoothies are also on the menu.    When I got home to enjoy my treat, the froyo was not melted at all.  It was rich, creamy and the flavor was not overpowering--the perfect complement to my own store-bought toppings--exactly as I remembered it to be.

Stopped in one Saturday afternoon for an iced Toddy.  The coffee was well-balanced and nutty--no hint of bitterness in this cup!  I spotted a nice selection of full leaf teas and a handful of pastries, but nothing screamed "EAT ME!"  The staff were friendly enough but kept the interaction to a minimum. It's an ideal spot to stop and relax; that is, if you don't mind battling the traffic of Scottsdale Quarter.  If you're looking for a late night java jolt, head to the Starbucks across the way in Kierland.

I finally decided to give Menchie's a try.  Situated on a highly trafficked area in Scottsdale Quarter, they've somewhat mastered the art of getting people in and out in a timely fashion.    One walks in and circles around the cash register, beginning with grabbing a cup, trying the flavors, loading up on toppings and then paying. It's a small space but it seems to work.   It's one if those where they don't trust the customers to get samples themselves; I find this counter-productive to the fact that it's "self-serve" once you settle on a flavor.     There's a good selection of flavors but very few non-fat options. On the plus side,  the flavors are rich and most of them spot-on; a little bit goes a long way.  I chose dulce de leche with a little milk chocolate. Both were rich, creamy (but not over the top creamy) and packed with flavor.     Next come the toppings, which are organized in neat little compartments, each with its own spoon.  I liked the inclusion of non-fat granola in addition to the "old fashioned" form.    The containers of fruit toppings were filled to the brim, and there are hot toppings in addition to the standard Ghirardelli ones in pump bottles.  Marshmallow cream?  Hot fudge? Oh my!  This particular Saturday night there was live music--a teenaged boy with an amazing voice playing an electric keyboard--a unique touch to get people through the doors.  It's best to park in the garage just south of the building; finding a spot on the street can be a nightmare, especially with the congestion from the surrounding restaurants and nightlife.

I thought my boots were beyond repair after a long trip to San Francisco.  Little did I know, the owner of JR's Shoe Repair is a miracle worker.   My colleagues urged me to visit JR's Shoe repair for some boot-TLC. It's an unassuming shop tucked away in the west corner of the AJ's center. Just walk in, discuss the repairs and when you need them, and pay.   He's super speedy and did an absolutely phenomenal job. My beloved boots are resoled, refurbished and look brand spankin new. They look better than they did when I purchased them!    Do yourself a favor, don't go out and waste your time trying to find a replacement pair. Take them to JR's for some pampering.

Holy cow!  16 flavors to choose from?!  Swirl your own samples, as many as you like?!  $0.39 an ounce?!  Yes sir, Yogurtini gets an A in my book.   Find the shop by heading in the direction of the movie theater...Sparkly new and spacious interior, friendly staff, and a huge toppings bar also do the trick. The flavor profiles are solid and the froyo doesn't immediately melt like a Popsicle in the desert...and yes, this is important, considering we are in the desert.   I'd give this place five stars if there were more fresh fruit toppings...having oatmeal cookie froyo doesn't hurt either.    A great deal brought me in; I left with a smile, a satiated sweet tooth, and another coupon to bring me back next go-round.

It'sugar is more than just a candy store; it's a world of candy. This store is packed with everything candy-related, from candy decor (pillows, blankets, accessories) to candy bars, bulk items to half-pound Reeses Peanut Butter Cups (I kid you not).   Looking for a cake-sized rice crispy treat or a tootsie pop the size of a large grapefruit?  It'sugar is the place to go. They even sell gummy bears by the flavor.  Now I know I can make a bag of candy with my favorite flavors (I always eat around the orange and yellow gummies in a prepackaged bag).   It'sugar is located directly across from the iPic theatre...although It'sugar is on the pricey side, it's still a better deal than candy at iPic. It's glowing aura practically screams "buy your candy here!"

Stone and Vine is tucked away in the center behind Sprouts, right next to  Renegade Canteen.  It's spacious and has a modern, eclectic feel.  We were a larger group, and they sat us at smaller tables of four. This wasn't a problem, but it was unexpected.   The service was prompt and the staff were attentive, but it seemed to take a long time for our food to arrive; when it did I was very pleased. The vegetable flatbread had plenty of veggies and wasn't "over-cheesed".  The pear and arugula salad was tasty; I felt satisfied even with the small size.   The prices were slightly higher ($2 for each additional topping on a pizza?), but I'm willing to pay more for quality ingredients. All in all a nice dining experience.

There's something abut this location that I love.  The food is always tastier.  The portions are always larger.  The staff are always friendlier.  The architecture is more unique than other locations.      Maybe it's more appealing because I typically stop by this Chipotle after hitting the gym, when I'm absolutely famished.  Yet again, maybe the food's just made with more love.  (Not that I've ever had a bad meal at Chipotle...)  I'll gladly drive a little out of the way to dine at this location.  Right now I'm hooked on the chicken salad.  I'm very picky about my toppings and  they're always very accommodating.  Side of brown rice?  Check.  Separate containers of two salsas?  No problem.  A teensy bit of cheese?  You got it!  True Chipotle consistency, with a little bit more pizzazz.

Why did I wait so long to visit Jimmy John's?!  My memories of this chain are filled with lackluster sandwiches. Guess I was ordering the wrong thing.    I checked out the menu online so I could contemplate my choices without holding up the line.  My decision:  a turkey unwich.   Oh, I was skeptical. I mean, how big can a lettuce wrap be?  Turns out Jimmy John's found the jackpot of humongous lettuce leaves.  The only disappointment was the minimal amount of turkey. Everything else was incredibly fresh and tasty.  The dijon had a nice kick to it and the peppers were DELICIOUS.   The cherry on top was walking out and--gasp!--being THANKED for my business.  Thank you Jimmy John's, for adding a little brightness to my day.

I didn't know what to expect from the Egg I Am (aside from eggs). The menu is quite large; I found myself debating between breakfast and lunch.    From the breakfast side, the whole wheat pancakes looked yummy, as did the omelets and "Egg-ceptional" dishes.  Yet the chicken spinach salad was tempting...same with the grilled chicken sandwich (I'm partial toward chicken).  My final decision?  An egg white and veggie omelet from the "healthy options" section. It was fresh, fluffy and all-around delicious.     They're still working out some of the kinks in the kitchen (a few of our dishes were missing a couple components), but the energy and promptness of the staff make up for this.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and it was nice that no one was waiting too long for their dishes (it gets tricky serving 20 people at once...).  All around a solid choice for breakfast.

Don't let the silly name fool you; this place has some serious frozen treats.  We've all had our fair share of sno-cones and Italian ice.  Ice chips doused with sugary syrup, often settling at the bottom.  In my opinion, these frozen desserts suck.    Rita's reinvents the sno-cone.  It's like Baskin Robbins but with flavored ice instead of ice cream.  No ice chips here!  The frozen ice is crushed so fine that it's like sherbet, complete with each flavor mixed in.  There are close to fourteen flavors of Italian ice to choose from, two of which are sugar-free.    Did I mention the have some PHENOMENAL custard?!  It's thick, rich and decadent.  Rita's keeps the custard simple:  chocolate or vanilla and also "Slenderita" versions too.      The best part about Rita's is what they do with these two components.  Yes, you can have the Italian ice or custard by themselves, but I highly recommend trying one of their unique creations.    The Misto blends Italian ice and frozen custard together to create a decadent shake.  Take this to the next level with a Blendini: custard, Italian ice and your favorite "mix-ins"--almost like a Dairy Queen Blizzard, but more flavorful (and highly customizable).    Order the Gelati to get the best of both worlds; it's like a parfait of happiness:  custard, Italian ice, topped with custard. I had the vanilla custard, mango Italian ice, topped with a dollop of vanilla custard.  The best part was when I reached the bottom--the custard had just began to melt, creating a sinful combination of creamy mango goodness.    As soon as I began consuming my treat I was a happy, happy girl.  I guess that's why they call it Rita's Ice Custard Happiness.

Distrito is a unique dining experience; located in the Saguaro hotel, the decor is quirky, colorful and fresh.  This place is a foodie's paradise.   The menu consists of modern Mexican tapas (small[er] plates), an interpretation of the street food of Mexico ("Distrito Federal").  Everything comes out as its ready and is meant to be shared.  Flavors are Iron Chef-worthy (after all, it is Iron Chef Jose Garces's creation); whatever you do, don't rush through the meal!  Every bite packs a lot of flavor, and it was fun to discern each ingredient as we pregressed though the meal.   My favorites were the yellowtail ceviche (atón), the traditional guacamole, chilangro chop salad, tacos de pollo, tacos de mahi mahi, and jicama con manzana (jicama, cabbage and apple slaw).  The cochinita a la pibil (berkshire pork shoulder with achote and pineapple BBQ) was a little too acidic for my taste.   It was an enjoyable dining experience, definitely out of the ordinary. I'm excited to return for different tastes from the plentiful menu.

I'm dissatisfied with my current gym (I won't name names...) and decided to check out Mountainside.  This facility blows my current gym out of the water!  It's pristine, spacious and has plenty of room to grow.   Every part of this gym was impressive.  The equipment is pristine and cutting-edge, and there are many items that traditional gyms don't have: TRX, heavy ropes, punching bags, a boxing timer, resistance tubes, kettle bells, platforms....the list goes on.   The yoga studio is another highlight. It's fully equipped with ballet barres; listen to therapeutic-sounding cascade of water during one of the many yoga, pilates or barre classes.    The locker rooms are actually a beautiful pre- and post-workout retreat.  Did I mention towel service?!!  Friendly, knowledgeable and courteous staff are a bonus.  And an awesome smoothie bar and apparel section.   Drawbacks:  no basketball court or pool. My current gym has both but I don't use either, so their absence isn't a big deal to me. Also missing are sanitation stations. It would be helpful to have disinfectant handy to wipe down the equipment after use.   I can see myself here. I hope they maintain the clean, pristine atmosphere!

I'm now a proud member and I'm loving every part of this place!  It was only fair to post a review after my complementary fitness assessment.   The fitness consultation was low-pressure and I felt like I actually learned something.  My activity level, goals and diet were assessed, then I was taken through a workout to evaluate my overall fitness. I was dreading the post-workout sales pitch, but Chip put me at ease and didn't try to sell something I didn't need.   The facility is clean, spacious and the equipment is cutting edge.  It's impossible to become bored with your workout when you've got TRX, heavy ropes, bosu balls, kettle bells, resistance bands and a plethora of machines and free weights.  I took a yoga class the other day, I was very impressed with the expertise of the instructor and the serenity of the studio itself. There are at least two classes going on simultaneously throughout the day, and you small group training, TRX, boxing and other exclusive classes are available for a small fee.    The locker rooms are clean, serene and include nice amenities--towel service is always a plus!  For an added fee, members can enjoy the "Executive Lockers," which include a few more perks than the main locker room.   I was worried that it would be too crowded during peak hours, but I have yet to wait for a machine, even at 5:30/6 pm.  They switched out the paper towels for sanitizing wipes--very convenient.   The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and already know me by name. The management actually listens to member requests (I dropped a suggestion into the comment box; it was accommodated within a week!). I feel good about this place, I hope it stays this way!

We decided to try Calistro California Bistro late one Saturday night. Thank goodness it was open, all nearby restaurants were closing and we were starving.  It's tucked away in the center behind Houston's.   I was pleasantly surprised!  The decor has a modern, clean vibe--stylish but not excessive.  The food is exceptionally fresh and I loved the staff--they were incredibly helpful and engaging and kept us in good company at the bar.  We scored such an incredible deal: Greek salad, Mediterranean flatbread (best flatbread I've ever had!), a generous bowl of hummus, and a beer for under 25 bucks. I'm eager to try some of the main entrées; the chicken looked awesome, as did some of the other salads.   I'm definitely coming back!  It's a perfect place to take my mom and grandma when they come to town; they'll love the food and we can sit on the climate controlled patio without sweating our butts off when summer rolls around.

Hours of my time have been spent at J Crew.  The sales associates are very helpful, reserving fitting rooms, checking in the back for sizes, even running around the store as you stand unclothed in the dressing room.    Clothes at J Crew are more expensive than your typical store but you are paying for quality clothing.  Many dresses and skirts purchased elsewhere have hit the dust as my J Crew pencil skirts and blouses stand unscathed.  Need shoes to complete the outfit?  Maybe a sparkling accessory?  J Crew has you covered.    Plus, everything can be mixed and matched.  The clothes here fit me like a glove; not only are they stylish and work appropriate.  I feel confident, feminine and professional in these clothes.    Ask for the teacher discount if you're in education!
