Small cute place with excellent food: I liked every item I had which doesn't happen very often. I wouldn't wait for a special ocassion--perfect for a nice date night. Being a comforted by food person, this did the trick when we most needed it. 4.5 stars   Food: 4.5, service: 4, atmosphere: 4.3  Cost to worth it rating: 4 (starters around $10, entrees ~$30, desserts $9)  Return worthiness: yes   Highlights:  - Scallops: 4 large ones seared and cooked perfectly on top of creamy grits. Orange marinated fennel and sauce introduced a citrus flavor that added to the layers of the dish yet didn't overpower it.  - Tomato soup: delightfully fresh, highlighting natural tomato sweetness, topped with chiffonades of basil, and for a southern twist fried mozzarella balls. Amusement point was the presentation: with the 2 balls for eyes and olive oil half arch below, it looked like a smiley face. Hub and I shared and they split it into 2 bowls for us which was great since he had a bit if a cold. Heard from other tables you could get a half bowl as well.  - Roasted garlic: loved the cloves sitting on the table. Tender and mellow enough to spread on warm sliced bread: perfect start to a meal.  - Pumpkin waffle with maple ice cream: festive fall dessert and presentation with berries scattered all around. Chose it for the waffle which was great, but star was that house made maple ice cream: bursting with sweet maple flavor with a creamy texture.  - Wine list: heavy on great napa/sonoma ones so of course we approved ;-)  - Atmosphere: small comfortable dining room. Upscale refined food but no stuffiness came along with it which is my favorite combo. Saloon doors to the restroom amused me.  - Service: wait staff knew their dishes and explained them in detail  Lowlights:  - Not on opentable.com: my preferred way to make reservations and usually just go to places that have that option. Had to make the hub call to reserve.  Lovely spot with food that didn't disappoint. Reminded me of one of my faves Nick's back home and will be back if get a chance.

This night's dinner puts Ruth Chris back on top for my favorite chain steakhouse. Superior service by our waiter largely contributed to this.  Cost to worth it rating: 3 (standard steak prices)  Highlights: - Ruth's classics: set menu for $40 for choice of entr√©e (6oz filet and shrimp was one), salad or gumbo, personal sized side, and small dessert. Filet itself is mid-30's, so excellent deal. - Waiter: We got a certified pro here. Sean not only far surpassed my expectations for a place like this, but was fit to work at any highly rated fine dining establishment. He topped our experience at many a places like this (most recently Charlie Trotter's) by doing the secret waiter hyper observant eavesdropping thing as a tool to anticipate our tastes and needs. After minutes at the table, he already deduced we were wine fans and on his own initiative delved into giving us a taste of one of his new favorites that was coincidentally already one of ours too. Immediately we knew this guy will be cool. He was gymnast-level flexible accommodating modifications to the set menu (swapping out sides, giving blue cheese crumbles, doubling up on mousse for the non-berry lovers, etc.), telling us whatever the question, the answer would be yes--the level of service I'm always hoping for. Also chummy friendly sharing info about how many kids he had and talking iPhone apps with me when I pulled out my phone. And this treatment just wasn't for us--I saw him doing the same for all of his tables near us. - Wine: pretty good choices across price ranges and with the help of Sean we ended up with a great one. He shared one of his preferred wines we weren't aware of, saying if we didn't smile after a taste, we could choose something else. Of course we were happy with that Shiraz. When ordering sparkling, he wisely let us know they had a muscato di asti which the hub loves after his 6 month living stint in Italy. - Filet: cooked perfectly and served on a sizzling hot plate of butter which doubled as presentation flair and sears in flavor. I'm picky about my steaks and this fit the bill. The shrimp were nicely intertwined together and placed on top of the steak. - Dessert: mini berries and cream and chocolate mousse in a chocolate shell. Perfectly small proportions after a hearty meal like we had.  Lowlights: - I've patronized many a Ruth Chris over the years and even though their steaks are relatively consistent, their service has never been this good. Thanks Sean for that and tell your wife you're doing great, but now the bar us set high for my return visits and I doubt they'll live up to this.   Thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be back if not to this location another one for sure. Thanks Sean to making it such a great experience!

I heart Westin hotels--I completely buy in to all that heavenly stuff in beds, showers, etc.--and this is now one of my favorites. Beautiful property with many amenities and a superb staff.   Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 (satisfied with their rates based on other resorts higher prices)   Eve award: one of top 5 hotels I've stayed at   Highlights:  - Full service resort: I've been to places with pools, a restaurant, and a spa, but this extends to so much more. Multiple restaurants and places to sip drinks, activity schedule, several pools, and expansive grounds. It reminded me of a cruise ship experience without the cheesy factor or being confined in.  - Pool areas: a mellow adult pool with a lap area sectioned off, a fun large swirly/curved shaped pool, lazy river, and even a waterslide. Areas are surrounded by cabanas I'm sure are perfect sanctuaries on really blistering hot days. A bar with food (note can order off the room service menu) is just a few steps away to ensure your thirst and hunger needs don't go unsatisfied.  - Drink areas: the rim itself has the bar area as well as the comfy chairs in the mid-section and expansive outside including an awesome fire pit. The xxx has a cozy western room theme specializing in whiskeys and bourbons. Deseo has a lounge specializing in muddled drinks like mojitos and often with a fabulous Cuban??? Artist creating colorful paintings right there.  - Staff: impressed by how professional, friendly, and welcoming each person was during our stay  - Arizona art: scattered all around the property are unique art pieces like the one in the center of the water by the golf course. In addition there and gorgeous palm trees and cactus planted throughout.  - Location: just a few minutes from wherever we wanted to go (restaurants, downtown, etc.) and across the street from the lovely outdoor Kierland commons shops  - Kid-friendly: activities and places they can go to have their own fun  - Balcony: like that our standard room has this small space outside with a table and 2 chairs  - Parking: valet is free til 11pm and have option to continue the no-charge by self-parking in the big lot in front overnight   Lowlights:  - Resort fee: I'm all for what the place has to offer, but wish would just include in the rate vs charge extra since you don't have the option to deny it  - Wireless charges: broadband is included but it's up to 24/day extra for wireless which bothered me   On my first visit for a weekend away, fell in love with this resort as well as Scottsdale. Definitely will be back--hopefully as part of my regular trip rotation.

Under-par for even a hotel bar. 1.7 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 1 (martinis for $12 and not a bartender talent level or atmosphere to support it)  Highlights: - Convenient: if you're staying in the hotel - Outdoor seating: patio area with misters if you want to be outdoors or have someone who wants to smoke - Indoor seating: long bar and some tables and couches - Vodkas: have level as well as Ciroc, Effen, and some flavored options - White cosmo: ok, not too sweet  Lowlights: - Service: didn't get paid attention to for a while and long lag between getting drinks that we ordered - Snacks: sub-par wings and even chips and salsa left a lot to be desired--bland - Shot prices: $10 each for mixed shot - Hours: last call at midnight on a Saturday night  Won't be back unless I'm needing a drink and too lazy to leave the hotel.

On the lookout for lunch when we arrived, many places were closed so I turned to trusty yelp and found this delicious, casual, authentic spot.   Cost to worth it rating: 4  Food: 5, Atmosphere: 3, Service: 3   Eve award: best chimichanga I've ever had, dish of my scottsdale weekend can't stop thinking about   Highlights:  - Chimichanga: Green chili shredded beef not my usual order but had to try when read the rave reviews. It was packed with hidden spice as you can't see green in the meat. Nice contrast and balance when eaten with the shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and guacamole. Surprisingly not greasy for something so fully deep fried and delicious with the generous handful of Thinly shredded cheese which delicately melted on top. I so want another right now.  - Cheese crisps: got introduced to this Arizona treat which caught my eye on the menu. It's a flour tortilla with a lot of melted, crispy cheese on top. Red sauce in the large squeeze bottle was the perfect amount of spice to go with it.  - Seating: indoor area as well as small patio outside   Lowlights:  - Bathroom access: kind of odd you need a key as the bathrooms are inside...  - Corn cheese crisps: figure I'd gluten free it since didn't with the chimichanga, but lady dissed them saying they're a lot smaller and can't get as crispy. That fine, but why don't you take em off the menu then?   Fell in love with this chimichanga from my yelp find and will be back if ever in the area. I honestly was contemplating going back the next day but figure since I was visiting to mix it up a bit.

Xmas lights explosion + dive bar = great fun.  Highlights: - Decor: over the top cheesy a la Buddy the elf and I loved it. - Rooms: several areas plus outside - Drinks: standard dive bar fare with quality alcohol options   Lowlights: - Not for the craft cocktail crowd.  Would come back here any day of the week.

Quality NY style thin crust pizza in Old Town Scottsdale.  Food: 4.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 3.5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (bit pricy for shared small salad, small pizza, and sodas for bit under $40) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Pizza: nice crispy and chewy thin crust, fresh tomato sauce, and quality meats. Bonus for meatballs as a topping. - Variety: can choose red (tomato), white (olive oil), or green (pesto) on pizzas and few versions of salads to start. - Wine by the glass: long list though just ok quality mainstream choices  Lowlights: - Sizing: 2 people is a bit much for a small with 6 big slices. We could've easily shared what they called a personal--and we're not light eaters. - Didn't have room for cheesecake and the amaretto one looked great.  Enjoyed this pizza and would have it again.

Nice mid-range family-friendly smaller hotel property.  Highlights: - Jacuzzi tub: one of my favorite things ever. This one had one surrounded by a 1/4 pie shaped rounded capsule because it also was a shower. In the larger room my cuz was in, it had a heart shaped one which I loved! - Pool: good size with a waterfall on one end and a jacuzzi hidden underneath the rocks. Loved that it was heated since we went at a cooler time of the year. - Rooms: nicely decorated with southwestern theme (Kokopelli all around) and clean. I thought it may be old and dated from reviews, but it was not. - Playgrounds: 2 on the premises with fake grass which I liked so little ones can crawl around - Free wi-fi: always like that - Themed courtyards by vegetation: we were palm which was my favorite  Lowlights: - Bed and sheets: not quite heavenly and sheets were pretty rough - No restaurant: this is a nice to have for breakfast and such - Room service: limited menu just til 4 - Loudest toilet flush: not the biggest deal but we had our baby with us so we were worried it'd wake him at night  Our favorite family-friendly Scottsdale hotel is the Westin Kierland which is a bigger, more elaborate resort property, but we'd come back here again if that's booked.

Cute spot with unique pizzas off of the main downtown university street close to the zoo and airport. 4.3 stars  Food: 4.4, Atmosphere: 4.3, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 Return worthiness: yes Eve award: best variation of fried raviolis  Highlights: - Toasted raviolis: filled with delicious jalape√±o cheese. And I thought I couldn't possibly love fried raviolis more than I already did ;-) - Crust options: from crispy paper thin to Chicago pan to stuffed - Potato rosemary pizza: great combo of garlic, potato slices, caramelized onions, bit of gorgonzola, and havarti cheeses - Tub o Parmesan: wait staff comes around with it to scoop on top - Patio: liked that option in the middle of the 2 inside dining rooms and sweet that they have blankets out there in case it gets chilly - Staff: very friendly and helpful. We had a big party and they tried their best to accommodate us as quickly as possible - Menu: with wings and pasta and sandwiches, a lot more to offer than just pizza  - Fun retro decor and music: classic style ads were on the front of the menu - Dirty monkey: classic rum fruit cocktail that was quite delicious  Midlights: - Sangria: just ok, not so much fruity flavor - Pizza cookie: half done to give it that gooey almost cookie dough-like texture, but I prefer it a bit more crispy  Lowlights: - Only certain pizzas can be thin or Chicago style and the menu isn't so clear on that so it's a bit confusing  Enjoyed this yelp find and would eat here again or another location since I found out it's a chain.

I always enjoy this line of restaurants where you can be transported into a relaxing vacation even just for a meal.   Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 5, Service: 4  Cost to worth it rating: 3   Highlights:  - Atmosphere: islandy calm and relaxing fun. Everything smells like pineapple and coconut. Big bar area upstairs, patio downstairs, as well as open window patio upstairs as well are nice seating options.  - Blackened fish sandwich: white fish cooked well and slightly crispy on the seasoned top. Only thing is I could have used some more spice. I appreciated the soft, slightly sweet grilled bun as well as the pairing with the refreshing cucumber tomato salad.  - Cocktails: huge menu list of fun mixology and tropical items  - Bread: big hat-shaped hunk of soft and warm yeasty goodness  - Desserts: the tray always looks enticing especially the pina colada cake, but I usually don't have room. I do like that they have a half portion option for a smaller taste.   Lowlights:  - Pork sandwich: sauce was way too sweet and I like sweet bbq. The southern hub couldn't even finish it.   Pleasant tropical retreat for a meal and I would return.

Always have loved this place but now love it more after seeing Hubert Keller on Top Chef Masters. 8-) 4.5 stars Note to SF folk: they just opened one in Macy's Union Square--yeay!  Cost to worth it rating: 3 (burgers start ~$10, specialty burgers are more) Return worthiness: yes (I go at least once each Vegas trip)  Highlights: - Peppercorn burger: yummy rich sauce from Fluer de Lys recipe served on the side so you can pour to your liking. I added blue cheese crumbles to take it over the top. As a pepper fiend, I actually could've used a bit more pepper on the actual burger. :-o - Ranchers meat (or something like that): as the second level up, it's definitely worth the $1 upgrade. The hub got the standard and I could tell the difference in pure meat flavor as well and juiciness. - Seasoned bacon: peppered and jalape√±o are options  - Jalape√±o fried pickles: couldn't taste the spice so much but they were great and  like that they were spears - Make your own: array of toppings including regular things like a selection of cheese to not so mainstream like fried egg and pickled beets   - Open late: weekends til 2am - Sweet potato fries: thin, crispy - Veev acai spirit lemonade: not too sweet, interesting dynamic with antioxidants in an alcoholic beverage--wonder if they cancel each other out ;-) - Personal tv in booths: great for sports days  - Milkshakes: come all sundae style pretty with the hugest straws ever, also come in alcoholic versions which is great for sin city   Lowlights: - TV options: wish could switch channel and they had the direct ticket  Love this place and remains my casual Vegas staple so I'll be back.

Stopped in for brunch to give food network some love and had a good meal. 3.6 stars  Food: 4, atmosphere: 3.5, service: 2.5 Cost to worth it rating:  3 (most brunch entrees around $16) Return worthiness: maybe  Highlights:  - Egg tostada: liked this a lot mainly because of the ancho chili sauce. It was smokey, dark, and sweet. Love that the eggs were just lightly scrambled and airy. Also enjoyed the crispy fried tortilla on the bottom and dug that the layer of white cheddar lined the tortilla instead of traditionally being draped on the top. Was a huge portion however. I feel like they used 8 eggs just for the one dish!  Midlights: - Bread: just ok. I didn't think the corn muffin had much flavor. I liked blueberry coffee cake square the best  - Pork sandwich: expected more bold flavors from the pork itself but the crispy panini bread was very good  Lowlights: - Service: not very attentive--had to wait a while for our order to be taken   Liked my brunch dish and would consider coming back.

Nice modern artsy chill getaway from crazy Vegas. 4.5 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 3 (more expensive than average hotel but can get deals sometime) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Decor: open, tall ceilings in the lobby and artsy, colorful, long hallways on the room levels - No casino: probably what makes it so serene to come back to, though if you want to gamble the Mandalay casino is close - Steps away from Mandalay restaurants: from Burger Bar to Aureole there are some great spots   - Access to beach: a fun benefit, as I love the wave pool - Classy rooms: huge jacuzzi tub, nice views, large extra comfy beds - Welcoming check in: we had an extra cheery personable staff member help us which set a good tone for our visit, as I was worried the place might be stuffy.  Made us feel VIP without the pretentiousness. - Room charge card can be used at lots of hotels on the strip - Club at top floor: nice view, good music, not crazy crowded    Lowlights: - Internet charge: no wireless included, stark room with computer pay $1/min plus $1.50/printout--even a standard hotel in other cities have a computer in lobby to print out just boarding passes or room key access business centers. At a luxury hotel, your room charge should include this to avoid guests feeling nickel and dimed.  - No mini bar: we had smaller room but was odd (esp cause they gave us a key for one at check in). - Said we could get complimentary access to upper floor bar for yet charged the hub at the entry point even when showed guest key.  All in all, I really enjoyed our cozy, fun, and comfortable stay here and would love to return.

So curious to finally visit the internationally acclaimed line of restaurants by the chef with the most Michelin stars ever and instead of being disappointed by the hype like I often am, I thoroughly enjoyed it.   Cost to worth it rating: 3 (quite expensive, but if you do the tasting menu it's on par with other fine dining/Michelin-starred places)  Eve award: best amuse ever (shot glass of foie gras parfait with parmesan foam)   Highlights:  - Setup: relaxed counter seating like at a diner but fancified version with fine dining food--love the concept since I love high quality food but could do without the stuffy formal atmosphere that often comes with  - Redefines a dinner show: you're looking right into kitchen which is amazing live entertainment for a Top Chef watching foodie like me. Loved watching the precision in the process of one of the best kitchens. It's crazy they aren't allowed to talk to each other which so not like you see on TV (or read about in Anthony Bourdain) with those yelling chefs  - Different levels of menus: from a small set all on one plate to a 4 course and a 10 course  - Don't all have to do the same menu: awesome option for the hub and I as most places insist on the whole party being in synch and complain about timing discrepancies, etc.  - Unique presentations: amuse was served on a lava rock, pumpkin soup in a martini glass in a circular vase with fall accents  - Scallop with chives: never had this tender preparation before--more delicate fish-like texture than traditional seared style  - Onion tart: sounded so simple but was almost like a small pastry disc of a sauceless pizza with bacon and hearty mushrooms and shavings of amazing cheese  - Sole with baby leeks: light yet substantial and purely delightful  - Hanger steak: melt in your mouth with fried shallots delicately placed on top  - Dessert: quartet of tarts (including snickers and passion fruit) were scrumptious, but the real star was the peach confit infused with moscato d'asti in an apricot milkshake--unexpected and refreshing sweet dish  - Service: excellent and professional, easier for them to be around more with the smaller space to work. All of the staff was happy to chat as well as simply present the food and disappear for a more pleasant well-rounded experience.  - Wine: when I inquired about a wine plan, the waiter served few glasses to work well with multiple courses  - Teppanyaki: when I've been in fine dining kitchens I don't remember seeing one of these long flat cooking areas so I found that interesting   Lowlights:  - Overwhelming when you see a la carte menu prices for appetizer size items around $40--go for one of the tasting menus instead  - They don't advertise wine pairings so I had to ask about it and they did have one to offer   LOVED this meal--best I've had in a while with every course being fantastic. I'd be more than happy to return--soon. :-)

After almost 4 years, returned to the spot of one of my favorite dining experiences. Food was still first rate, but service was lacking this time so have to downgrade it from 5 stars.  Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 2 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (tasting menu $159, wine pairing $105) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Menu options: you can do whatever want from getting a bunch of appetizer portions, a la carte entree, 4-5 course of your choice from selected items, or a full 9 course tasting menu. I like that the whole party does not have to agree on the direction. - Seared foie: one of the best versions I've had (and I order it as often as I can). Thin slice with the perfect level of crispy sear on top and melt in your mouth texture underneath that. - Onion tart: still a favorite. Like an upscale quiche but the thin version with a crispy bottom layer. Presentation with the tiny egg in the middle, thin cheese triangles on the side, and confetti of bacon was beautiful  - Rose: the star of the wine pairing and I appreciated the departure from a syrupy sweet wine paired with seared foie. - Amuse: Parmesan foam and foie isn't a common combo, but it worked. Kinda looked like a latte in a shot glass which was fun - Foie gras sliders: not my dish but looked amazing and got rave reviews from my friends. Mini beef burgers with seared foie on top paired with crinkly fries and a ginger ketchup.  Midlights: - Wine pairing: glad they added this since my last visit but it was more like a few glasses than a true course by course pairing. Was a bit challenging saving half while waiting for the next course as well.   Lowlights: - Waiter: fine when he was talking to us but he was never around. The worst part was almost the hour gap between the cheese course and desserts. After a several hour meal, my table was getting restless. No acknowledgment of the issue at this caliber of a restaurant was very disappointing.  - Tables: not as fun without a view of kitchen. I'd suggest all the seats in the place have a clear view of the kitchen - Fish: bit overlooked and not much flavor   Enjoyed my meal, but next time I'm going to sit at the bar area so I can see the action and ensure a better level of service.

For the bar only: sub par wine, but nice view. 2.5 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 2 ($18 for a wine flight; overpriced to supplement the view)  Highlights: - View: high level where you can look down upon the buildings of downtown Phoenix - Rotation effect: trippy but fun. After 55 minutes, you'll make the full 360 trip around. - Signs: every so often, at a spot on the wall they'd have a marker indicating what you were looking at from that particular view  Lowlights: - Wines: liked that they had flights (called trios), but oh dear were the wines bad. Between the hub and I, we sampled 6 wines and did not care for any of them.  Go for the view and order a cocktail. If we feel like peering over building lights, we'll be back. If not, we'll go for an evening drink elsewhere.

Good central location in downtown old town Scottsdale. 3.5 stars  Highlights: - Location: close to many restaurants, bars, and stores in any direction  - 24 hour food: order in the lobby - Rooms: sizable with a couch seating area  - Good shades: gets dark for those who like to sleep in - Tv: good size flatscreen - Fridge: nice to keep drinks and leftovers  - Pillows: fluffy and nice  Lowlights: - Sheets: not so comfy--bit scratchy   Was fine for us for the weekend and enjoyed being able to walk everywhere.

Unique artsy personality of a local bar. 4.5 stars   Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 ($7 for a big 18 oz bottle of beer)   Highlights:  - Personality: in a converted house, part art gallery (and sacrilegious at that). Tattooed and casual staff as well as a DJ/live music spot in back. Very chill and individualistic. Berkeley-esque.  - Bottled beer selection: fills up a whole menu page and a fridge as well as coolers behind the counter  -- Large bottles: we had ones that were 18 oz, but there were some even larger  -- Organic: many options of organically made beverages, one of which was a cider from the UK that was quite good  -- Gluten-free: Never seen this option on a bar menu and was excited to see it for beers here  -- Bay area pride: they carried Rogue 8-)  - Life: not boring or touristy like other places by the ballpark. Thank goodness we found a happening place to hang out at on a Friday night. Thank you Yelp!   Lowlights:  - No liquor for mixed drinks  - Bit hard to find, as it's an unmarked house   Loved this placed and definitely would come back.

Awesome happy hour even on weekends. 4.3 stars  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 5 (for happy hour half off house margarita and appetizers) Return worthiness: yes Eve award: best az queso dip  Highlights: - Queso: green chile version was awesome and chips were extra crispy. 5 stars  - Happy hour prices: we got 2 beers, 2 margaritas, a taco, 4 taquitos, and queso and chips for $25!!! - Staff: everyone was friendly  - Setup: seating and bar upstairs and downstairs with tvs to watch sports  Lowlights: - Chicken hard shelled taco: not much flavor and meat a bit dry - Took quite a while to get our appetizers after we ordered  Had a great time watching the Packers win here. I'll be back for the queso at happy hour.

Loved it! And I honestly wasn't really expecting much, as I didn't know anything about the place. We went here for New Years and I was just happy we had reservations somewhere. I was just looking at my pictures and that was pre-yelp time for me so I figured I should review it now. 8-)  The food was awesome. We did have bottle service in the room by the big window for our big group so there was drinking involved in the evening of course, but I think it really was that great. I liked everything we had, the view of the Bellagio was phenomenal, and our waiter was super fun.  Food highlights: * Sushi over crispy rice: by far the best dish of the evening. My husband doesn't even like sushi, but he ate the rice part up and wanted more.  * Any of the sashimi: fresh, good quality and great flavor combinations   The cooked fish and everyday unagi rolls were great (very soft rice) along with the veggie tempura. Everything is just taken up a notch here and not in a just for flashy way but in a way that works.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas. The bar area looked fun and trendy as we were walking in.

Unassuming deli spot with a huge menu including their own crafted meats, bagels, breakfast, and desserts. 4.5  Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 3, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 Return worthiness: yes! Eve award: best non-burger sliders I've ever had  Highlights: - Jewish sliders: tender sliced beef brisket on top of deliciously seasoned crispy potato pancakes in between 2 soft dense shiny challah buns. Top in with the gravy it comes with, and you're close to true bliss. Amazing!!! Though that man vs food guy tried to eat a dozen in a half hour--that's a bit much. - Corned beef hash: one of my fave breakfast items and this is one of the best. Smooshed ground version with crisped edges but not processed tasting or too salty - Fries: crispy wedges but potatoey soft inside. Fantastic when dipped in the gravy - Brisket dip: twist on the traditional French the hub enjoyed - Could take large groups: we had 16 and there was a party in the back room with 30  Lowlights: - Some breakfast items have time restrictions: things like eggs benedicts are only served til 3pm (there was a crazy one I wanted to try on top of a potato pancake)  Had a great family meal here and would come back for those sliders alone.

Carolinians, you no longer have to go to Charleston for your Jim N Nick's bbq.  Cost to worth it ratio: 3  Eve award: best cheese biscuits--move over Red Lobster  Highlights: - Cheese biscuits: more like a muffin actually--soft, fluffy, cheesy, with a bit if sweetness and complete with a crunchy outer layer. You need at least a few baskets of this when you're here--the rest is just filler. - Pig salad: not just iceberg but romaine and spinach as well topped with the mother size of all croutons, plenty of shredded cheddar, charred meaty bacon, succulent grape tomatoes, and my favorite clincher: almond slices. You have a choice of meat and beef brisket is always mine. Solid salad. - Beef brisket: my fave is still in Texas, but this is pretty good outside of that. Thick but tender pieces with inherent flavor. Not quite cuttable with just a fork, but close. - Drinks: they have a full bar and impressive beer and wine list. I don't expect great wines at places like this but they touted glasses of honig sauvignon blanc and seghezio zinfandel. Also they make great cocktails with fresh squeezed juices. I had a peach tea which used their lemonade and even though it was on the sweet side, it was great. Big score for a casual spot with great food and drinks! - Atmosphere: Open, comfy, roomy, and woody. Love the booths against the wall. - Service: fast, friendly, and attentive.  Midlight: - Bbq sauce: I like a buffet if options and you get 2 choices here. Regular was tomato based but a bit too light and vinegary for me. I was a bit scared off by the habenero, but I prefered this sauce, as it was a darker mollasses-like color and didn't have an unmanageable kick.  Lowlights: - For some reason I think it tasted better in Charleston where I was completely blown away, but don't get me wrong--it's good stuff.  Excited to have this location relatively c

Unassuming small strip mall spot with stellar food and service. If I owned a restaurant, I'd want it to be like this. Accesible fine dining food in a casual yet nice armosphere. 4.7 stars  Eve award: wagyu pastrami--best pastrami ever (sorry NYC delis)  Cost to worth it rating: 4 ($150 for 2 including multiple glasses of wine, shared app and dessert--quality of food is definitely worth that and have paid more for lesser meals)  Highlights: - Wagyu pastrami: A-maz-ing! Melt in your mouth tasty. Gotta love the nice touch of the red onions on top and the pumpernickel crouton on bottom. Beware kids, this is only offered on Tuesdays and Thursdays--you need to make your reservation for one of those days. - Staff: fell in love with them. Waitress (Elizabeth) was all that I ever look for when dining out: friendly, engaging, casually chatted with us and was actually interested vs obligatory, helpful, positive, and attentive. Other staff members were excellent as well, making us feel like good friends who were welcome instead of out of place visitors. They all were SF fans as well which was cool. - Duck dish: duck was good, but the accompaniments were the show stoppers. Fried gnocchi and tiny cubes of pancetta, oh my! - Steak frites: rib eye entree was pricier, but the hub settled on this dish. Worried about the inferior quality of a lesser priced item at first, his fears were unfounded, as the slices of steak were utterly fantastic.  - Wine: top rate in every glass we tried (and we can be awfully picky living so close to Napa). - Donuts: sauces were the best in caramel, jelly, and chocolate.  - Extras: from amuse (surprised to get one here) to bowl of fluffy pink cotton candy (whose kid in them wouldn't love that?) to the party favors chocolate chip desserts to go, they were execpected treats that elevated this dinner from everyday to spectacularly special.    Lowlights: - Location: hard to find hidden within one of many loaded strip malls. Not a mainstream spot, so our cab driver wasn't familiar with it at all. About 15-20 minutes ride from downtown.   Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner date here thanks to Yelp identifying an off the beaten path place. I'm a Niner fan, so contemplating coming back for a divisional game so I can eat here again.

Spotted this familiar chain across the street from the Cardinal's stadium in the restaurant-filled outdoor Westgate mall.  Cost to worth it rating: 3  Highlights: - Beers: ~113 on draft, pints, yards, and half yards (2 pints worth) available  - Lemonade: specialty vodka cocktail with a sprig of mint that was perfectly refreshing and not too sweet - Sweet potato fries: thin and crispy with a drizzle of syrup - Spicy chicken sandwich: blackened and on a flatbread roll which was thin yet dense and grilled - Jerk wings: sauce was a wee bit spicy yet sweet - Patio: tables and couches with misters - Bathroom (from the hub): 5 urinals and shelf to park your beer glass which he thought was awesome  Lowlights: - OC chain so not really getting the AZ experience.   Nice afternoon spot for drinks and snacks.

One of my favorite places for ribs. First one I went to was in Greenville and we had our rehearsal dinner at the one in Charleston. ;-)  Cost to worth it ratio: 3  Eve award: Best baby back ribs  Highlights: - Ribs: Meaty but tender; large but no major gnawing needed - Sauces: A variety of your choice for your ribs. Pick from carolina sweet, tennessee whiskey, memphis style wet, memphis style dry, carolina mustard, or haba√±ero hot . -- Carolina sweet: my fave sauce. Basic tomato based one but with more sweetness to it like I like it --Tennesee whiskey: my second fave--has a bit of a whiskey kick - Sides: it defaults as cole slaw and beans but you can pick any 2. Other options are cinnamon baked apples, southern style rice, green beans, baked potato, macaroni & cheese, seasoned fries, or potato salad. -- Mac and cheese: I was craving this and it hit the spot. Cheesy but not too gooey and soft but not mushy noodles. -- Specials: they had broccoli casserole and sweet potato crunch. Love them both. Broccoli was almost blended with the cheese like a filling and very cheesy. Mashed sweet potatoes with brown sugar and nuts went well with the ribs but doubled as a dessert. :-) - Napkins: no measly white paper things here--they give you a green towel. ;-) - Lunch specials: they have a small portion of ribs as well as a few ribs and a bbq sandwich with sides - Location: driving distance from the hub's parents so a dining option I know I'll enjoy  Lowlights (my flip side to highlights): - MSG: I noticed most of the sauces included this and I prefer sauces that don't include this. - Pecan pie: I love pecan pie but never get to it here cause I fill up on ribs  I'll be back to Sticky Fingers next time I get a chance.

It's so disheartening having a bad meal in Vegas, but that's what happened here. I would've been more understanding with better service but all I can give it is 1.5 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 1 star (~$20 lunch entrees) Return worthiness: no thank you  Highlights: - Open artsy design: green cones on the ground, large windows, and high ceilings - BBQ pork bun: decent representation of Chinese dim sum however accompanying sauce was off putting as well as broken and grainy - Pretzel bun: soft interior with pretzely exterior - Coke products: so many places have the other beverage   Lowlights: - Slow service: didn't get drinks or bread for a good 30 minutes, didn't offer butter for bread or refill drinks - Food came out cold: unacceptable at this caliber restaurant but since its newly opened more so that I told waiter and he pretty much just said an uncaring "oh" unpaired with an apology or offer to fix it - Asked for sparking cava only one on menu and waiter said huh and had to study the menu (which only has a few wines by the glass) for several minutes - Croque Madame: most boring tasteless white bread ever, cheese not melted, bechamel congealed and cakey (ham was good however) - Steak frites: tiny portion and we solely ordered it for the poutine (gravy cheese fries) and only when it was being set on our table an hour layer the waiter said they don't have curds yet. Meat was just passable and gravy was all globby.  I understand the place was only 2 days old but some things like decent service shouldn't be that hard to offer especially at a locale that us aiming to be upscale. At the very least admit to the mistakes and thank guests for their patience. I doubt I'll be back.

Popular, friendly, and clean chicken and waffles spot that's worth the wait.4.4 stars  - Chicken: crispy and well seasoned but not too greasy, tender meat inside - Cornbread: sweet moist mongo muffin with crispy edges - Waffles: like that you can get them cooked with pecans in the batter though wish they'd make em a bit crispier - Fried okra: I always order this when I see it - Fun drinks: 4 different flavors/colors if kool aid and super crazy the way the southerners like it sweet tea - Atmosphere: dinery slick red booths - Service: very friendly and food came out quick  Midlights: - Mac and cheese: I didn't care for the sour creamy taste of this particular version, but my cousin loved it - Red Velvet cake: we're a fan of this type of cake, but this rendition was just ok. Moist soft cake was great, but the flavor was lacking   Lowlights - Long wait: even Sunday at 2:30 there was an hour wait - Ran out of banana pudding: the southern hub's favorite dessert he was looking forward to ever since he saw the commercial. Sad he was so disappointed - Closes at 4 so don't plan on dinner. Sad seeing people come in and be turned away...  I'm not a fried chicken connoisseur like my hub but I think I like this even better than traditional Roscoes and wouldn't mind coming back.

Lively burger spot with fun appetizers and boozy milkshakes.  Food: 4, atmosphere: 4, service: 2 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (my burger with additions was almost $20) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Steakhouse burger: loved the pepper-crusted patty as it was no joke--you could see the full peppercorns. The onions were sweet and really good. I added an egg which was cooked perfectly so it ran to create it's own sauce from its yolk. Only con was the bun wasn't anything special or worth it. - Bacon wrapped stuffed jalape√±os: spicy! Liked the crispy bacon. There was cheese inside but not too much which my partially Asian stomach appreciated. - Fried pickle spears: had the bumpy kind of breading which I liked - Milkshakes: my friends loved these fun combos like smores or banana peanut butter cup (drunken monkey). See above comment for why I couldn't enjoy one, but I would've loved to. They do have fun vodka flavors on hand to make these like chocolate coconut which I do want to try. - Fried bacon: never seen this outside of a county fair, but was pretty good in a smooth crispy batter - Longhorn burger: the hub got this with BBQ brisket on the burger which seems crazy, but as a meat lover pizza type, he liked it - Sweet potato fries: crispy and the right level of sweetness. I couldn't stop eating them. - Decor: liked the fun art on the walls with toki doki-like characters  Midlights: - Philly cheese steak egg roll: they looked like the Jack in the Box ones--which I love by the way--but with a tough exterior  that didn't work for me  Lowlights:  - Service: our waiter had a fun personality but the service was nonexistent.   Had a fun lunch here--I'd come back and hope for better service.

Not sure if it's truly a secret being popular on yelp, but glad I was let in on it. Absolutely loved this stop on my tour of the Cosmo  Food: 5, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 Return worthiness : yes! Eve award: one of the best slices I've had  Highlights: - Pizza: amazing. Perfect chewy yet crispy crust, fresh tomato sauce, and tasty toppings. I'm gonna go out and say it's one of my favorite ever and one of the best things I ate on this trip. It's so good, I can't do it justice in the description. - Toppings: stoked they had meatball and ricotta. Thinly sliced huge circles of meat were fantastic  - Open late: we went at 3am on a Sunday  - Atmosphere: small spot you get to in a long hallway with a few pies out for slices and pinball machines.  Lowlights:  - Wasn't in the hotel we were in and didn't discover it until our last night there so only had it once :-/  Loved this pizza and can't wait to have it again!

Loved this spot from the moment we walked in: vibrant atmosphere, excellent service, and great food. 4.5 stars  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 5, Service: 5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (barrel aged cocktails $12, entrees $26-34) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Cocktail menu: extensive list and unique barrel aged ones. I went with one of the bourbons. It was potent and tasty. Paired well with the bacon popcorn  - Bacon popcorn: hub awarded this the best thing he ate during our time in Scottsdale. Pieces of bacon plus tossed in some bacon fat. Could get a bit greasy but flavor was great and surprisingly not too in your face. 4.5 stars - Salad: never heard of a more hyped salad--has its own Facebook page and all--but it was very good. Think why it stands out is the variety of textures: dried corn, pumpkin seeds, little date pieces, Israeli cous cous, and arugula leaves. Another standout flavor was the marinaded tomato pieces. Default was salmon but we went with chicken and enjoyed it. 4.5 stars  - Scallops: solid version with good sized scallops cooked well. Velvety layer of grits were delicious with it. 4 stars - Dessert: caramel filled mousse cake and chocolate biscotti with ice cream was decadent. 4 stars - Irish coffee: excellent version with just the right amount of froth, sweetness, and cream - Atmosphere: lively room with a square bar in the center of it all. - Staff: everyone was friendly, knowledgable, and on the ball - Gluten free options: so many of the menu items were noted as gf which was nice to see  Midlights: - Short ribs: bit dry for my taste. 3 stars  Lowlights:  - Didn't have room to try the sandwiches: they looked really good   Best dinner we had this trip and I'd come back for sure.

Unfortunately Yelp steered me wrong on this one as our dinner was only ok.  Food: 2.5, Atmosphere: 3.5, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (entrees around $20)  Return worthiness: maybe for a drink at the bar  Highlights: - Bread: delicious slices that were crispy on the outside and warm, soft, and a tad bit sweet on the inside. 5 stars - Raviolis: special app was pretty good with a nice cream sauce to dip the bread in. 4 stars - Cocktail: fig vodka mule. Interesting twist and a solid mule. - Late dining: took reservations up until 10pm  Midlights: - Live string band was cool to have but it got really loud in the dining area - Bolognese: nice flavor but not a lot of meat. 3 stars  - Service: girl seemed nice but service was a bit awkward which was unexpected for a nicer place  Lowlights: - Seabass: way too oily and mooshy texture. Spinach was also overly oily so it was hard to eat. Very disappointing. Assume it had to be sitting too long or something since other reviewers raved about it. 1.5 star  Food was a letdown so wouldn't recommend it.

Been curious about this restaurant for a while. Was a beautiful dining room and good food, but not ultra amazing for me.  Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 3 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (didn't find quality to be miles above other Japanese restaurants to warrant the pricing) Return worthiness: maybe Eve award: best fancified shave ice  Highlights: - Big portions: expected tiny plates for the tasting menu, but the portions were really large. Started with 3 huge pieces of white tuna  - Shaved ice: huge mound of airy shaved ice with fruit, jellies, mochi and tofu ice cream hidden below. Tofu ice cream had a firmer texture that was a nice contrast to the delicate ice above it. 2 sauces were provided to pour over: green tea and passion fruit. Surprisingly the hit of the night  - Variety of sashimi: 3 different preparations and 6 in the nigiri set - Decor: loved the modern, lively, open feel to it with bursts of color - Flourless chocolate cake: I've had a lot of these, and this was an excellent rendition. Warm and melty inside with a bit of a crunchy exterior layer. Appreciated the Asian flair in the bento box presentation and green tea ice cream pairing. - Not all have to tasting menu: like this as it makes ordering easier especially with the non-seafood eating hub - Cocktails: fun menu--we tried a few  Midlights: - Service: hard to catch our waiter   Lowlights: - Undercooked miso cod: this is a signature dish, so was very disappointing. It had a gummy texture and didn't flake off like it should.  Had a good meal here but not sure I'd race back.

Love this hotel. Just opened in February and it's an upscale calming oasis amidst standard Vegas crazy. 4.75 stars  Cost to worth it rating: 3 (more than other spots but well worth it) Return worthiness: yes Eve award: best hotel shower in the US  Highlights: - Decor: asian art was nice with a black dragon outline above the bed and nice japanese lamps and paintings  - Shower: I'm a sucker for a great shower and this was one of the best. 2nd only to a waterfall style one in Shanghai. Long walk in area with a powerful multi-jet square shower head. Also really nice toiletries there waiting for you. - Room: spacious and with a comfortable bed and cool long couch where 2 people could spread out abs chill - Little touches: from the trendy swipe in front of the door key to the college dorm room style tassel that means do not disturb to the fuzzy soft flip flops they leave for you by your bed each night, it distinguished itself from other hotels  - Staff: top level service - Room service: awesome menu from nobu with upscale Japanese items not even on the restaurant menu  Midlights: - Fancy elevator: have to scan your card to get in which is secure but my cuz and I had to go in different elevators which was weird - In Caesars: the persona of the hotel only extends to the small reception hallway and the rooms. On the plus side, you get all the big hotel amenities like the huge pools, restaurants, and mall.  Lowlights: - Welcome tea: never got ours and my cuz got hers a day late - Scent: overpowering floral smell in the reception hall  Loved my stay here and would definitely return.

Hidden downtown Charlotte gem with delicious food and liquor options in a fun upscale atmosphere. 4.4 stars  Food: 4.5, Atmosphere: 4, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (apps $6-12, burgers $9-13) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Burgers: meaty with a good char flavor and a soft bun - PM burger: pulled pork was soft and juicy with tasty BBQ sauce and a little crunchy heat from the fried jalape√±os. Meat overload but in a good southern way - Fried pickles: I'm an aficionado and these were one of the best. Significant textured crispy breading of thin pickle chips. - Whiskey flight: you choose from huge list of options. Beware: I was expecting small taster glasses but there are 3 very full shot glasses which is a bit much for one person :-o - Banana pudding milkshake: nice fresh banana flavor the hub loved with booze to boot - Ham and cheese: fried flat puck of fried mozzarella with prosciutto on top. Right up the hub's alley. - Sweet potato tots: sweet and tender inside yet crispy outside - Tall tea cocktail: not too sweet and refreshing - Waitress: helped pick the whiskeys for me since I'm a novice and gave comments on dishes we were considering - Atmosphere: nice decor inside with large bright music-related art to make it pretty upscale but with 80s and 90s music videos playing on the wall - Hours: open late (close when bars do at 2am) for night owl bites  Midlights: - Mac and cheese: fine cheese flavor but didn't care for the thick noodles   Lowlights: - A little hard to find but look for the signs. My phone maps told me it was on 6th but it was off of 5th   Loved this place's character and the food to back it up.

Nice salad and sandwich lunch spot by the ASU campus. 3.5 stars.  Food: 3.5, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 4 Cost to worth it rating: 3.5 ($10 for panini or half panini and salad) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Wine list: eclectic where I didn't recognize one on the long list. Like the $5 until 5 deal. I wasn't even feeling like having wine with lunch and I was lured into it. (I'm not a hard sell).  - Sunshine salad: different veggies plus bacon and cashews. 3.5 stars. - Turkey pesto sandwich: fresh and liked the crunchy ciabatta bread. 3.5 stars. - Bruchetta: had a bunch of options that looked good and could pick 4. I'll try that next time.  - Gluten free friendly: had GF bread options as a substitute - Patio: nice area to enjoy the Arizona sunshine  - Cool logo: peace, love, wine, and music. What else do you need in life?  Lowlights: - Potato chips: the hub thought they were overlooked and weren't so crispy   I'd come back in a wine mode and hang out in the sun for a while with my Sundevil niece.

Swanky cocktail bar with great live music.  Highlights: - Cocktails: some classics like a sazerac plus a few cool ones like a green chile vodka one - Live music: loved the guy with a guitar singing his own cover versions  - Bar: long rectangle with comfy leathery padding to lean on - Atmosphere: bit dark and cool with a good mix of people away from the more lively bar areas  Lowlights: - Music stopped a bit early so we only got to hear a bit. Energy wasn't as electric when the musician left.  Loved this spot and would come back.

Fun, happening larger bar on a party strip of Scottsdale.  Highlights: - Decor: super random from US and UK flag sofas to the infamous fragile leg lamp from a Christmas Story - Photo booth: fun during a night out  - Long bar: wasn't too hard to get a drink even when it was crowded - Music and video screens - Across the street from late night tacos  Lowlights: - Not for those who want a quiet cocktail   I'd come back with a group of friends for a night out or to watch a game.

Pub I liked and would be cool when more people are there. 3.5 stars.  Highlights:  - Bourbon mule: using Tin Cup bourbon it was delicious (and I'm picky about my mules). 4 stars - Bartender: super honest saying they have a drink list but probably don't have everything they need to make them. When he poured the last of a bottle he charged me less which was nice. - Cheese curds: we never get these in California so had to order them. Solid version with slightly sweet breaking. A great late night snack. 4 stars - Some outdoor bar seating  Lowlights: - Bit dead when we were there--it was later on a Sunday night but before the big game.  I'd come back for more curds and drinks.
