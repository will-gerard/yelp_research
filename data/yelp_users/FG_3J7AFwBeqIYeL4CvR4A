Horrible horrible horrible! My friend had told me about this restaurant, and really hyped it up so I went in with very high hopes. We went in on a Friday evenining so I knew it would be busy, but this was just ridiculous. We got the crab puffs, dumplings and sushi. The crab puffs had no crab in the middle, the tempura sushi was smooshy and under cooked and the dumplings seemed microwaved and just fell right apart when I put my fork in them. I was so disappointed with everything and the manager not only was rude, but our bill arrived and they still charged us for everything we didn't eat!! And also not the mention everything is way over priced! Will not be going back, save the money and go somewhere else!

Wow management here is an absolute joke!! Went to get my car washed here today and had a Danny's free car wash coupon. Asked the guys in the front line if they could honor it even though they have switched there name to Jacksons and they agreed and took my car through. I went to pay for my wash and the guy said he's never seen the coupon before and had to get his manager to see if they could honor it or not(after the guys already said they could) I said okay but make sure they don't take my car through the tunnel until we make sure the coupon will work. The manager came over and said no we don't take these coupons because we haven't been apart of Danny's in a year and a half but I will give you 5 dollars off for the trouble. I told him to forget about it, and I'd get a car wash else-where. He radioed over to the front line guys and told them what was going on and they said my car already went through the tunnel and it was too late (after I told them in the beginning to make sure it didn't go through unless the coupon worked) then the manager proceedes to tell me I owe them 15 dollars for the wash. Are you kidding me??? Is this how you treat your customers? will not be returning! Thanks for the half ass job Jacksons!

Updated review- I visited Dino's again this afternoon and was very pleased with my experience this time. Although I did have problem with my stuffed shells being a tad bit under done, I explained my concerns with my server and she fixed the problem quickly with a smile on her face, and when I cashed out at the end she even gave me some delicious cookies for the trouble. Very nice staff, thanks for the tasty food! Will be returning! :) thank you!
