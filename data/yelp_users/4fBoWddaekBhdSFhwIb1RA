Attended a buzzcation event tonight at Morton's. The venue was great and the right size for the amount of attendees, the food was GREAT and the service was the best I have seen at an event of this size. They served endives with blue cheese, salmon pinwheels, filet sandwiches and a tomato brioche that was superb. I hope they re book here for another event - either way I am sure to go back.

Annette Garcia fixed a major mistake of another salon on my hair - Yea Annette to the rescue. I walked out looking sassy and feeling better than ever. Then she suggested getting a new lipstick and the make-up lady found a new color that popped. Go here if you really want professionals that care about their work and how you look and feel!

Wanted some sushi quick and fresh. Went here today and the wonderful lady making the sushi create my order in no time and exactly the way I ordered. Delicious - had salmon, tuna, mackerel and eel, added a mixed roll of the same fish. And when I asked for extra ginger, I got extra ginger!

Limited stock in the labels I was looking for, but great sale going on on the clearance racks - 70% off original prices. DNKY, R Lauren, Eileen Fisher, and more all there. Grace the salesperson was helpful and ready, willing and able to help.

Went here with a friend and got some of the best service in town. Lucy was our waitress and she was on the ball, cheery and attentive. We both had great sandwiches and they even have gluten free rolls. Can't eat the desserts but boy did they look fabulous. Masterpieces in the case. I' ll go again for sure. Ask for Lucy,

Stayed here twice, once on a visit and the next time when I moved to Scottsdale and was waiting to move into the condo. From the valet to the desk staff everyone was really nice and it seemed as if they loved their job. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. When I ordered room service, it showed up sooner than they said and it was really good. I highly recommend staying here when in Scottsdale.

When I got to Scottsdale a couple of my art pieces needed reframing. Took them here and Michael the guy at the framing department helped pick out exactly what worked. Love that guy and love my art even more now that it looks so fab on the wall. Will do more framing with Michael at Michael's. PS no relation to the store.

Stopped here for the first time and got more than I expected. A great big hug, a gift book for a client and an introduction to things I hadn't known about Arizona. Judith the owner is kind, very helpful and attentive. Told her what I was looking for and she helped me find it - didn't just point to a section. She went over and looked herself!  Interesting store with some great things to give as gifts - or keep for yourself. I'll definitely go again.

Stopped by to get some hair products and perfume. Shaun, the Clinic rep was there to say hello and was more than willing to help, no matter that I needed items other than cosmetics. He has a great energy and a kind spirit - great customer orientation.  Fragrance and cosmetics earns a 4!  Salon earns a minus 1 the worst ever! The rest of the group needs retraining. Not at all the staff that I expected     My experience has been different - the Atlanta store on Lenox Road is the best anywhere in the country and when this group gets that customer service makes you the best, they might try harder. The salon is another thing...don't go there!! They do not listen to what you want, don't care about what you want and are the worst trained of any Ulta of anywhere I have been in the country. You deserve better, so don't bother trying this one out.

Not a Rack I will frequent. Too sloppy, not easy to find what you want and looks like they have the "runt of the litter" stuff here. Really disappointed. Been to 10 or so other Rack's in other cities and this was by far the one of least interest for me. Hope they shape up.

Thank you! Troy Alsobrook you are amazing. On the way to an important meeting this afternoon and  ended up with a flat tire...flat as can be. Had the spare put on and headed to my next appointment. Saw this location for Discount Tires and I drove in at 5:40. They close at 6:00 but Troy took care of me right away, found the tire in their inventory and got it taken care of right away.   I have been using Discount Tires for a long time since 1999 in Atlanta and now in Scottsdale. Every location is great, but I gotta say that Troy was fabulous. He saw my distress and concern - the tires on my car are not cheap - found me in the system and my policy covered me with just the new insurance and indicator rebuild. He had the car in and out in less time than it took me to call for the road service.   Thank you thank you to Troy and his staff.

Felt like a little Italy restaurant in NY or Baltimore. Great food and nicely presented. Been here 3 times with friends who are regulars there - they come from Chicago and are Italian. So when they go I go too!  The wait staff are attentive and the pace of serving the courses is just right. The veal shank is drop off the bone excellent, the  hef's special seafood was fresh and absolutely divine...I asked for a soup spoon so as not to leave any of the broth behind.  Fabulous. Thank you!

Tried 5 nail salons since moving here..most 1 try and never again. Then I tried Allure Nails & Tan. They are the best. The entire shop is clean, the mani/pedi staff are really customer oriented. Everyone here is smiling, like what they do and treat the customers well. I was a bit on a time line and Mimi and Richie did a great job. I wasn't rushed and I still made my next appointment. My nails look great. I have naturally hard nails and like my cuticles pushed not cut and my nails squared. Exactly how I like them. This place is the best!

I went here today to see if they had the replacement carafe for my coffee maker. They didn't have a selection just 2 and neither worked for what I needed. Then decided for the price to buy a new one. Just on a whim, I checked e item at the target online and store price. What a surprise - Target's price was $5,00 less. So for &@# and giggles, I checked a toaster I am replacing - that too was $5.00 cheaper at Target!  This is a humongous Walmart. I guess it gets bigger charging more on items you expect to save on...

Was there just before the remodel and thought the food just okay. It was 7:00 pm and we were the only ones in the front dining area. The waiter was nice but not as attentive as we would have expected since there was no one else there. Not somewhere I would choose to go to again.

Okay, I am confused...one day I get the best deal in town another day the prices are higher than AJ's. I purchased green and yellow squash and it was $.40 per pound more than any other grocery I shop and not a sale any where. Yes they do carry some items I have a hard time finding. It is not a one stop grocery store, so I find myself still having to make 1 or 2 other stops. The good part is the herbal/vitamin area has knowledgeable staff that can help you get what you need. The rest of the staff is spotty asmto being helpful or not - depends on the day of the week or the mood of the day.  I' ll still shop there occasionally for a few items - particularly gluten free. I hope they do the retrain on some and get the group humming with a higher customer service attitude.

OMG! I just had the oil changed in my car and was out in less than 30 minutes. Called this morning, made a 1:00 pm appointment, got there a bit late - 5 mins. - and was given fabulous customer service. I use synthetic oil in my car. The price was reasonable already, but they gave me the coupon discount and it made it even better. They offered to rotate the tires, but I just had them done 3 weeks ago. Next time I'll do it all here. Thank you Kevin and team! Definitely a go to.

The best part of this place is the wait staff. They make the place and it's a good thing because the food seems to be deteriorating with every visit. It is close to home, so I am hoping that they improve the food.

Recently moved to Scottsdale and met a new friend for lunch at the Pima location. When I told the staff I needed gluten free they immediately made suggestions and offered choices that worked for me. The food was good and the staff was accommodating and friendly. They made me feel so welcome as a new Scottsdale resident.

I have gotten wings here twice. They deliver and in a lazy mode I had them bring wings and fries. The fries were hot and done just right and the wings were crispy, tasty and large...so far the best I've had in Scottsdale. The delivery guy was great too and got here in less time than they stated on the phone.

I stopped to get a car wash and gas. The attendant told me about a special that I first thought was a sales pitch. Maybe it was, but I got a detail that was one of the best I ever got and my car was like new again. They were nice, helpful and the price was more than right. You got it going and thank you.

Okay - this store is a lot smaller than the Atlanta stores I am used to, but they have a good selection. One hint - they have an Amarone wine that is most Divine! And a steal at $17.99 a bottle. Just don't buy it out until I get my fill!

Will never go back - first they ruin a St. John suit even after We clearly discussed how it needed to be done, and they said they were accustomed to St. John. Secondly- they promised a gift certificate for all the inconvenience and never sent it. I asked for a linen suit to be washed and sized lightly and they dry cleaned it instead.

I have lived here for 5 months. Diana Hansen, the property manager is attentive and responsive. Great Job Diana. All the vendors they hire to keep the landscaping, pools and buildings in good repair are doing their job well. It is always clean, well groomed and everything works like it is suppose to work. My neighbors are pretty cool too.

Food just okay nothing special. As a lunch that is okay, for dinner NOT. The staff customer service is mixed. Been there twice and the hostess in the front was terrific, the bartender was cool, the waitress - oh no!

If you are looking for a casual, low-key, taverny kind of place this would be it. Food is better than bar food and the servings are big enough to share. Been here a couple of times with friends from Chicago and they know the bartender and manager very well from years of making this one of "their" places.  The crowd is a mix, but more often older patrons. The service is spotty, but if the one you get knows you from coming in, the service is much better. Worth going and making it your neighborhood place.

The wings were disappointing; not crispy and just okay. That is all I tried. It was a take out and the service was good. That's all I got to say right now.

Fresh, tasty, and creative in presentation. The sushi is really good, probably some of the best in AZ. The house sake and the rice vodka drink they do is pretty good. I'll go again.

Did they get my grandmothers recipes!? The food here is really good, authentic and large servings. I went with a friend; next time we will split an entree next time. The hummus was fresh, the souvlaki was marinated and cook medium rare as requested and the salad had just enough feta. We did share a creme caramel and it was fab.

I really like this place and it seems to be the place to network. Everyone that works there is really nice and quite accommodating. It is kept clean, especially for as busy as it gets. If there is one problem it would be the parking...busy times it can be hard to find a space. Worth a try though.

Okay been here a couple more times and think I need to update. Of all the places to go this is now maybe my fourth choice. If you are meeting someone, go early to get parking otherwise you'll be later than you expect. The menu has changed and it doesn't rank as high as before - just okay, breakfast is poor and lunch depends on the day. The staff on the floor are hard working and keep it clean, the staff behind the counter is mixed. Some are cordial and others act as if waiting on you is a bother. It might be a networking place to be seen, and it seems to host cliques as if holding court...but it has lost the luster for me.

I like this place...you pick your yogurt, sprinkle your toppings and then weight in for the price. Cost depends on what you want and how much you want.  The staff at this location is helpful and knowledgeable. It is clean and kept clean...while I was there they were "vacuuming up" the toppings around the service bar. Good yogurt, clearly labeled and great staff...got to love those the people that help you learn about the system. Thanks for being so cool to a newbie.

I love good shoes and when a repair is needed, I want the best to make them look as good as new. Found Boris on YELP! and could not be happier with the outcome. Boris is a genius and an artist.  Took 2 pairs of boots to be heeled, polish and freshened, one pair of cowboy boots that are turquoise teal color, another suede BCBG boots. Boris colored matched the toes perfectly on the cowboy boots and brushed the suede to look brand new. Boris did both at a reasonable price and within a couple of days.  MAGNIFICENT! Boris gets all my business from now on! Thank you.

Had to have some reset on the iPhone. Came out of Ipic movies and the  store was just closing, but the lady at the door offered to set up an appointment for me the next day...really nice since they were closed. Came back the next day, waited 10 minutes - only 5 minutes later than the 11:10 appointment I had and they fixed it quick and easy! Thanks Eric and the lady the night before ( so sorry I forgot her name),

Stopped here for a quick pick up of lunch. Great service, cool people and the food was really good. They accommodated the gluten requirements, however the cook still put a flour tortilla in foil in my bag. They might consider a better system to avoid the waste and the no gluten request.

I came to Scottsdale AZ with very little furniture and needed to purchase quite a few items. As I drove around to get acquainted with the neighborhood, I came across The Land of Ahhs and walked in to check it out. What a great surprise when I found a great selection and such high quality. I knew what I wanted and found a few things right away. When I told the staff what I really had my heart set on, they showed me some pictures of exactly the right sofa. It was an off-white, down sofa with a slight contemporary look - mostly it was awesomely comfortable! At a price that made me smile!  Since they knew what I had purchased and what additional items I needed, they called me every time a piece came in that matched my "want to haves." My dining room, living room, and even some fabulous office furniture filled the condo within a few days to 2 weeks. They delivered right away and Corey and Wendell, the delivery guys were the best. Everything was placed exactly where I wanted it and no problems at all. Since then, I have bought some other items and even have taken some of my designer shoes and clothing to be consigned. Easy, fair and the best staff in one place that I have ever met. Thank you! Try it out.

I had a great time talking with local farmers and vendors. Lots of samples to taste and people that are really proud of what they bring to the market. I bought several items from 4 - 5 different vendors and came out with great veggies and meat. There was also a stall selling my favorite La Provence linens. It is a small market with unique and high quality items. Awesome group and will go every week.

Love this place! Good service, better food and comfortable seating. We sat in the deluxe reserved and had dinner...Caesar salad, Chinese rolls, Maytag blue cheese chips, filet sliders and drinks...  Make it a play night and invite friends to go with...laughed, ate and would have just spent the night - but another show as coming up...oh well next time.

Had a chance to try the crustless quiche today - works for gluten free. It had a good flavor, not over cooked and fresh ingredients. They are working on a gluten free crust for the pot pies and quiches. The meatless one today hit the stop. I'll try them again.

Thank you! Thank you! I am soooo glad you finally got to Scottsdale. I have been buying bras and intimate apparel from the Phipps Plaza Intimacy in Atlanta, GA for years. Was planing to fly back in March just to buy bras!  You will never feel or look the same again - pure upfront and natural with a youthful and sensual look.  Did I say "Sooooo glad you are here?!!?"
