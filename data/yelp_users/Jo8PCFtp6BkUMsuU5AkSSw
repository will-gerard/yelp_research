I have been going to Corleone's for a few months now because I wanted to try several things on the menu before I judge the place. Being a fan of Philly Steaks I thought this place would be good by the classic look of the place.   I got the tuesday night special where if you get 1 large sub for 10 bucks (without a drink of fries) you get a small one for free. It was interesting because I saw a lot of people order a large sub, and they weren't notified of the daily special. So I ordered the regular philly steak with a small hoagie.  He asked me if I wanted mushrooms or peppers on my philly steak, and i said yes, and I didint know that was an extra charge.    The Philly Steak was mediocre at best. They use low quality meat, and overcook it. The bread could be a lot better.  The guy suggested I put oil and vinger on the small hoagie I got, and I know why because it sucked! Covering it with tons of oil and vinegar is not gonna do the job if it's bad to begin with.  The only thing good here is the pizza and the fries. Stay away from everything else as it's also overpriced! $13 bucks for a philly steak combo? are you kidding me? Tell people about your specials, and stop penny pinching people for extra money. Tell me if peppers and mushrooms will be an extra charge.    In my opinion if you are gonna eat this bad for this price it might as well be good!

First of all I would like to say Pei-Wei is a good chain if you compare to the quality of other places of it's kind.  I walked in for lunch, and was surprised that they had brown rice. So I thought I could get a healthy meal, but I was wrong...  I talked to the worker at the front for 5 min, and asked her if there is a healthy (no oily/greasy) style way of making the dish. Unfortunately, we established that there was no way to do this.  Why have the brown rice option if you can't order the dish itself in a healthy way?     I ordered the Pei Wei style chicken, and I waited for the food to come. 15 min later I finally got it. Keep in mind there was no one behind in line, and one person ordering from the "take out" line. I watched  the whole process go down. The main chef put my plate down on the counter in the kitchen, and the "salad chef" was supposed to garnish it with a simple rosemary/parsley addition. That hand off took an extra 7 minutes.... It seemed to me that there was arguing,  and disorderly production behind the counter.  My other complaint would be that the dinner portion which not that large is kinda of pricey.  The plate looks huge when it comes out of the kitchen, but  the Plate comes with 75% rice, and 25% meat so don't be fooled.   Why would you want to eat that kind of protein/carb ratio?    I cannot order the lunch plate because it would not come with enough meat.

Day after thanksgiving me and my buddy thought we would have breakfast at Chompies. The place was crowded but we got seated right away. At first glance it looked like any other major deli, but after seeing the menu I saw that they have a different kind of selection.   Wanting to try a something new I went for the famous "Original Jewish sliders" as featured on Man vs Food. They are 2 pieces of challah with latka and and brisket, topped with cheese.  It was great, and It was super filling. I don't know how he had 11 of them. I was full after 3. They are packed and rich with ingredients.   My friend ordered the Spanish omelet, and he said it wasn't very good, but he finished it cause he was hungry.   Overall I would have to try more stuff on the menu to really judge this place. The service was pretty good, and friendly, but a lot of the food just looks average.

So I heard really good things about this place... I have been looking for a good Philly Steak in AZ, and wow did I find the right one!   I walked in just before lunch time, and didn't have to wait in line I ordered #2 the Philly steak, and provolone wit onions.  I know cheese wiz is the way to go for a traditional cheese steak, but I am not a fan of cheese wiz in general; I prefer a better quality cheese like provolone. I decided to get the large, and a combo with fries, and drink. I looked down at the counter ready to pay, and I saw a huge awesome cookie. The guy at the register claimed they were good so I had to try it out.  The total for this gourmet meal was $15...  I got the order in under one minute. I was pleasantly surprised, but at the same cautious because the food came out so fast it would suffer in quality.  Boy I was wrong! The Philly Steak was one of the best I have had if not the best. The fries were amazing!. Make sure you get the "fry sauce."  I washed it down with a coke, and finished it off with the giant cookie. The cookie was amazing.  The only negative thing I could say about this review is the price, but you get what you pay for, and I went all out. Look to spend about $8-$12 which is standard for a Philly Steak around this area.

Good Food, Good Service.  This place is very small, and the tables are very close to each other so it can get very loud very fast.   The sandwiches come on pretzel buns, highly recommended. The happy hour specials are good, but the happy hour menu can be quite deceiving.

We went for a Saturday morning breakfast, and it was packed.  We didint have to wait for a table, and the service was very fast and friendly.  A lot of kids in the place so it was very loud.   I ordered the chorizo omelet. It was fantastic! It came with old country potatoes, and biscuits with gravy. The biscuits stole the show.  I usually don't drink OJ, but i  am glad I ordered some because it was fresh squeezed, and fantastic! Not the crap you drink at ihop.   Overall it was great breakfast food.  Good place to go if you can handle the noise factor.

I was looking for a lunch spot on a Sunday, and there was not much open, but I stumbled on this place, and thought I would try it out.   I was excited to try the Italian Beef.   The place was empty, with a wanna be franchise feel.  There was only one staff member working, and he was taking orders, and preparing the food at the same time.  I ordered the 2 most popular products which were the Italian beef, and the Chicago style hot dog. I got fries and a drink as well. He said to wait 10 minutes for the food, and I was the only person in the store.  The Italian Beef felt like a mock sandwich of some sort. The bread and meat was awful.  I felt like a could of made a better sandwich at home, and the Chicago style dog was just a boiled dog I could of made better at home. The fries were the best part, but you don't go here for the fries.    Overall it has a sports bar atmosphere, but the Chicago style food is not close to authentic at all, and $12+ for lunch is not something I want to pay for this quality of food.

I stopped in with a buddy of mine  to get a few donuts. The place looked like a regular donut shop by the naked, and it was in the afternoon so I didn't think  I was in for a good donut. I was totally wrong!!!   These donuts were amazing. Better then Krispy Kreme I have to say, and I am a fan of Krispy Kreme.   I tried 3 donuts. The apple fritter, small chocolate sprinkle donut, and original glazed. Apple fritter was amazing, but my favorite by far was the original glazed. You can't just have one!

One day after work  I decided to visit the Curry Corner with my friend, and I was a little skeptical to try the food because I have tried a lot of average Indian food, and I didn't want to have that experience again, but I noticed the food was Pakistani style.  Since I had chicken twice that day already, I wanted to order a beef dish. The guy at the counter told me that they were out of beef.  Then I decided to order the most popular dish the "Chicken Tikka Masala."      It was a different kind of Indian/Pakistani dish that I am used to. Usually these kind of dishes are heavy, but this dish was very light, but flavorful at the same time.  The Naan bread was different as well. It was a lot lighter and fluffier then the usual Naan bread; the rice was pretty good too.  We ended up paying about $10 bucks a person. I would like to pay a little toward the $7-$8 range for this kind of place because they don't serve you, but $10 is ok.   Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food, and want something lighter, but flavorful at the same time.

So I was looking for a SUB on a Saturday for lunch, and I remember seeing Firehouse Subs because it was by the Sprouts grocery store that I go to.   I went to the website, and I decided to order online. I am glad I did because for some reason the Subs take  about 12-15 min to make. I understand they steam the meat, but still.  I thought that the online ordering process was a pretty cool feature. It had a lot of options to customize my sandwich. It definitely got me ready to have a SUB feast at Firehouse.  After checking out and spending almost $13 for a Large  (Steamer) SUB, and a sandwich plus a cookie. I was finally ready to pick up my order.  I decided to dine in to get the full experience. My order was ready when I got there, I got my soda, and used the Soda fountain to customize my soda which was cool.   The SUB was mediocre at best. Imagine a sub like Quiznos or Subway, but they "steam the meat."  That does not necessarily make it better though. They steam the meat so much that the meat was actually soggy, and the bread was meh. The cookie was a basic cookie, nothing special. The best part of the meal was actually the soda.  I would not recommend this place unless you want to pay high prices for a typical non gourmet franchise SUB.  The place looks and feels like Quiznos on roids, and with 5 people behind the counter it shouldn't take this long to make a SUB on average. I think that if you compare this to other sub franchises that it has an edge with all the cool hot sauces to choose from, and the Soda fountain that is not like anything else I have seen in a store like this, but the prices, wait times,  and mediocre SUBS hold this place back.
