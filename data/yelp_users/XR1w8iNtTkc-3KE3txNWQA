I wish this waz tha posterchild 4 truck stops...  They have fresh food just waiting for u 2 ordeR They have rowz of condiments that kik butt They have many tea choices, cold, only. They have tons of coffee choices. They have rowz of drinks in tha coolerz They have a GR8 slurpee selection They have a whole donut selection thing goin on They have those rollin weeniez in a billion flavorz...  Ok, so I exaggerated on that, but u git my point....  They are totally trukkr friendly n I aint even gonna say how lenient they are with where u park, even in tha fuel aisle, to grab sum zzzzzzzzzzzzzz'z....  I would complain abt tha lack of hot teabag choicez, but errythin else trumps that....  QT IS BOMB.COM

I was extremely hesitant when I found out this was our destination to watch the two playoff games for the 2015 Superbowl.  I am glad I didn't pay too much attention to all the negative reviews: THIS PLACE ROCKS!!  Its a bit loud and the staff is not the most up to date on how to properly use a P.A. system....but i survived.  I recommend the sports lounge located smack dab in the center of the casino. It was sexy hot and cozy...a good make out session was in progress but after being seated you could hardly tell :-D  A little ways off the beaten path but worth the drive.  Side note...its referred to as Gila River Casino, too.
