This review is for the Buffet. They advertise in their flyer in the room "Filet Mignon, NY Strip Fresh off the Grill, Prime Rib, Flank Steak!" for their Saturday night Steakhouse Buffet.   When we arrived to the buffet station, there was only fresh Prime Rib & NY Strip, which was sitting under the lamps with a title "Well Done". That is no way "fresh off the grill". There was no Filet Mignon & no Flank Steak.   So be warned. The Steakhouse Buffet is not really a Steakhouse. It's just a typical Prime Rib at a buffet.

$8 for XL pizza?! You kidding me! After paying $12 for two horrible slices at the convention center - I knew for the next day i would find something better. Yelp does not disappoint!!

This family owned business is my go to recommendation for anyone in the area. The pizza is absolutely delicious, and you can taste the freshness in each bite.  Today, we treated our selves to a half Basil & Garlic Pesto Pizza w/ half Diavola. I knew I was going to be in for a treat when I tried one of the peppers and bit into them. It was super moist, nicely grilled, and simply delicious. This is before I even dove into the pizza, and I was already happy.

These guys are seriously awesome! We threw them to the bees & snakes, yes literally, and they were able to get it done fast & quick.  Let's start off with the first meet. Within 1 hour I was meeting the guy for a quote, and he gave one on the spot (unlike the other companies that took 2-3 days to come back to me). He was perfectly on-time for the meeting as well -- which is no feet for him to come to Cave Creek from Tempe.  After I let him know that Happy Junk would be making me Happy removing my Junk, I was told they would start in 2-3 days. Well, guess what happened? The next morning, I get a text from them. "Hey, is it cool if we start today?"   So, just as he explained it would take him 3-4 days to finish the projects. Don't judge me, it wasn't my junk, it was left overs from the previous hoarding family. So on Sunday, when he is 2 days in, he texts me once again -- "Hey, we will be done tomorrow. Can we arrange a meeting?"  On Monday, they finished about the time they said they would. I went out to the empty lot and met them to pay them. And that's when the guys there were like -- "Heads up, you got some unwanted tenants like those bees in the Saguaro, those pack rats in the shed, and that rattlesnake that's somewhere here."  That's why these dudes rock -- they kept their word, followed through, and did it for the best rate in the Valley.

Don't order for delivery, took them almost an hour to deliver 2 sandwiches, 1 mile away.
