Just moved to AZ and was looking for some place new to get waxed.. I came across Judy's and decided to make an appointment I called and they got me in within 30 minutes! My appointment was with Jill and she was wonderful! I will be coming back!

Faye the cashier is one of the most uplifting people in retail I've ever come across. Seriously every time I'm in there she is so sweet! I work retail as well so I know how daunting it can be but this girl is so full of life! Anyway good job CVS for having an awesome employee!

The cupcakes we're alright the icing I was not a fan of . The cream cheese frosting doesn't taste a thing like cream cheese frosting more like buttercream. There was also way to much icing on these cupcakes and I could taste the grains of sugar in the icing. If you want a great cupcake skip this place and go to  Sprinkles in Scottsdale.
