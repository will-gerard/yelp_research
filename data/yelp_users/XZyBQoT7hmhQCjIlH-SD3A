As many have noted the portions here are overloaded with rice; which would be ok if its was nice Persian dill rice, but its not.  The Chicken kabob my daughter ordered was pretty good. My lamb kefta was a large portion, but it was woefully undercooked and lacked taste.  I would  have sent it back, but they could grill it a bit more; not sure how they would make it taste better.  I just picked out the properly cooked edges and left the rest behind.  Service was excellent, but the quality of the apps and food did not match the impressive interior of this place.

Second time eating at this top notch steakhouse in the NYNY casino. Service quality drops throughout dinner, but initially they are refilling water, folding napkins if you walk away to wash hands,etc.  Clam Chowder was chunky and well prepared.  Steaks are some of the best I have ever eaten.  French Fries are not plain steak fries as listed, but are well seasoned well fried and served with a steak sauce infused ketchup. Asparagus makes another fine side.  Desserts are "ok" and coffee refills are somewhat slow, but steaks are awesome.  Also had the Australian Lobster tail in '08 and it was great.

As promised, stopped by last week again.  Sat @ the lounge, ordered an iced tea (they only have green tea, BTW).  Grabbed a menu, only to recall the dish's name, but I was ready to make a run @ the duck. Placed my order and kicked back to watch some NBA action on the tv. About 7-10min later the waitress came back and said that they had run out of duck and asked if there was something else. I said "No", as I specifically came in for the dish. That is IT! Officially off the restaurant option list in Vegas. They just can not figure out how to run a restaurant. There are so many sushi options in Vegas, that pushing sashimi and nigiri @ $4/piece will not work. They do not have the high end foot traffic @ Mirage any more and from what I see between menu and service; they have maybe a year or less and they are DONE.

My review is only for the casino.  Poker room was tight and poorly lit, relative to other rooms in the area. Also not a big fan of the tables, similar to MGM, that have a hard top to the rail, making difficult to stack your chips and play your hand.  I prefer all felt to the rail, but that is a personal preference.  The rest of the gaming tables are tight as well and the layout of the playing area is not well laid out.  You will get easily lost and finding your way out to the strip is confusing.  The upside?  The outfits on dealers in the "pit" area are smoking!  They also have some table dancing late in the eve, great place to look around, as you are making donations...

This place is a great respite from the buffet lines and huge steaks served at the many high end joints on the strip. The standard menu was on the pricey side, but they were offering a prix fixe option for about $45 that the four of us decided to try.  Once we made our way upstairs, we were presented with menus, but no mention was made of the $45 option and the leaflet was nowhere to be seen.  When we inquired, the waiter sighed and brought it out.  I guess they think you will forget about it, as you make the trek upstairs to the dining room.  The portions we were served were a bit on the small side, but for the price it seemed fair.  Well my portion of the beef was the smallest of the three ordered, but I could use a little cutting back from time to time. The soup (squash, i think) was ok, but everyone else raved about their salads and the mozzarella tomato salad.  We also ordered a side of broccoli, which I guess threw them for a loop, as our entrees were served and the side was not.  We reminded them, but by the time it was prepared, we were basically done with the entrees.  I did mention that the portions are small, so five bites of the beef and it was gone.  Desert are basically some petit fours with coffee, which again is not going to fill you up, but were very good.  Overall, the food here was very good, even though the prix fixe meal will not fill you up if you are hungry and/or skipped lunch.  About a 3-4 star place, I went with 4 for the price and ambiance of the place.

Food service is slow and limited siting space.  Cream of brocc soup was very good, but the "pizza" was barely ok.  I would give this place @ best 3 stars, but then on my way back from shopping; stopped and had the "affogato".  I went with hazelnut (my fav flavor) and it was topped off with espresso. Holy XXXX! What a great combo.  They have a ton of great espresso drinks so stop by and enjoy. A word of caution though, this is NOT Starbucks.  They do not have Frappacionos,etc.  Saw a couple not happy with their drinks (they complained @ the counter) as they confused Starbucks' "style" and "prep" with authentic espresso drinks.

Visited this place twice: Once for burgers and the other for a carry out shake.  While the waiters walk around with t-shirts proclaiming their "greatness", the service here is poor, at best. On the dine in visit, he never checked back on us to see how the meal was and we had to flag him down to get a refill and then again for a check.  Food: Burgers are decent, nothing out of this world, but better than your typical chain restaurant.  You get a choice of fries and we had 2 different kinds, both came out a bit undercooked and lacked a nice crisp/crunch that should be automatic in these "high end" burger joints. Shakes are ok and the one we had was ~$9, which is highway robbery.  There was also about 1/2 a portion left in the mixer after she poured it into our to-go cup.  I asked her what she would do with that and she replied "We spill it out". I said that most would throw it in as a side car.  She gave me a blank look and poured it in the sink. So ~$9 for about a 12oz shake. Customer service=ZERO.  Plenty of TVs all around to catch a game and grab a burger if you are in the mood and walking by, but definitely not a destination place.

From the first time I played a hand here years ago to the tournament last week, this is THE poker room in Vegas.  The place fills up quite a bit, but there is still enough room to get around and the high ceilings create a great playing atmosphere.  Drinks are top notch and the only place I have been able to get a mojito. They also have coffee self serve setup, so if you need a quick jolt of caffeine, you can walk over and grab a cup.  The downside is that since the place has been packing in, the tournaments have moved out into the main floor and you are exposed to smoke and obnoxious non- stop pounding from the slot machines.  People also tend to hang on the ropes and peer over players' shoulders.  I heard that they are working on expanding the room to accommodate tourney play; similar to Caesars.  Also, some of the cocktail girls are a bit stuck up and even though I have tipped a buck for water and 2 for a mixed drink, they give you the evil eye.  Last week, one stopped asking if I wanted anything after 2 drinks and $2 tip each time.  Oh, well.

Yes its crowded and Yes the statues and picture taking get annoying, as you try to make your way through the place; but overall one of the most robust "malls" in Vegas.  If you have some extra $ laying around, then you will find many stores that would happily take it, say like $2k for a small clutch purse.  They also have some decent merchants like the sporting memorabilia store, Tumi and Tourneau for the watch enthusiast.  A Fuente cigar shop is tucked nicely underneath the escalator.  Its WAY overpriced, but with the OPUS X hard to find, you can always grab one here for a 100% markup over retail (that's about $40 a stick here), but hey its Vegas!  Tommy Bahama, Kiehls and Sony shops are located in the open atrium and the service at the TB shop is one of the best I have had across the US.  Top notch is still my home store in Northbook,IL.  What makes this place great is unlike Bellagio or some other indoor malls, you can actually shop here and not just window browse.

Great service with a smile. Drive-through is a big plus. I got the annihilator iced which was whipped up relatively quickly and I was on my way.

Platinum member for many years, I found this place while booking a room for the ASU orientation with my daughter.  We stayed here for 2 nights and that's about 1 night more than I can handle of this place.  First off, as a Plat member I was not offered any options that some have noted: No upgrades, no free drink at check in, just a $10 credit to the snack fridge.  Pros: (So there are not many):  - Close to ASU  - Low rate  - Nice pool and lounge area  Cons:  - No f'n closet and no storage drawers?  What idiot thought up this concept? Pegs on the wall and 2 hangers. Where do I put the dirty laundry: no bags provided.  Do I just peg all my dirty underwear to the wall? idiots!  - Water temp options in bathroom sink and shower are warm and hot  - Extremely loud hallways with drunks yelling in the middle of the night; I guess the proximity to college campus makes this happen.  - Staff is indifferent.  I asked for a fridge in my room upon check-in, told "ok, no prob".  8 hours later back at hotel, no fridge.  Called front desk and told that there are none available. I said I saw one in the hallway of my floor when I checked in. Was also promised one at check-in.  Response was: Well I am sure that one is somewhere else now and we have none available.  - Beds are hard as a rock and only liquid soap in bath.  Second day no washcloths provided.  - TV only has a few local channels and Chromecast.  No ESPN or any other decent channel to catch games and sportscenter updates.  I will be back in the area, as my kid will be @ ASU, but if I have to stay more than one night or pay more than $75: I would rather drive and stay somewhere else: pretty much anywhere else!
