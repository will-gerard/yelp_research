I absolutely love Jolie's Place. It is full of character and life. Once you walk in the door, it feels like home! The large bar is very inviting and is stocked full of a wide array of drinks to choose from. Once you make your way out to the biggest patio in Chandler, you'll fall in love all over again with this establishment! The food is incredible, I recommend the Green chili pork.   You'll always see Jolie herself going around the bar and mingling with the patrons to make sure all is well and if it's not, she will make sure that you get what you need, no questions asked!  Stop in on a Tuesday night, it's people watching and Karaoke night with the best Bartender tandem of Courtney and Jess! You'll also experience an awesome Karaoke Host that can sing!  Jolie's Place, where there's never a dull moment indeed. I proposed to my fiancé here! I love this bar!

I'm usually not one to write about a bad experience, it's happened to all of us. But I haven't been able to shake this.  Eight months ago, I heard that LoLo's Chicken and Waffles was going to open in Downtown Gilbert. I was overcome with excitement and showed up with my fiancé this last Saturday (2/21/2015). There was a 45 minute wait, which didn't bother us, we took a nice walk and returned to a partially full restaurant with people waiting. We saw some open spots at the bar area, so we took our names off the list and sat down. The bartender (didn't catch his name) advised us that he wasn't ready yet, but he would take our drink orders and gave us a menu. I had noticed that it was a newer menu from past times I had gone to the downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale locations. My fiancé, being a vegetarian, saw some options she liked, but wanted to just create her own omelet since they had some options for omelets anyway in the menu. I stopped someone who appeared to be a manager or GM of some sort and asked if we could make a change to an already existent omelet that was on the menu. He proceeded to berate us and said, "No. Absolutely not, this is not IHOP. Do you know how long it took me to make this menu? 8 months. I won't allow you to make changes to anything on the menu. There's a vegetarian selection, she can just eat that." He made a snide remark referring to her being vegetarian saying, "I'm sorry" then he said, "God put animals on this earth so we can eat them." We ended up ordering her a chicken omelet without chicken and subbed the cheese for jack cheese (which didn't get made correctly).  I've never been treated like that at a restaurant and I hope that none of you get treated like we were. We finished our meal and paid our bill.

You've never had ice cream until you've had a Cookie Cup, a Fatty Daddy's invention. I mean, listen to this: Ice cream, macaron, more ice cream ANOTHER MACARON, and then oh wait, a marshmallow? What? To top it off, they bring out FIRE to toast that thing?!?? My mouth had no clue what the heck was going on, but it wanted more of it.   Make sure you get in when they have macarons, but even if they don't, TRY EVERYTHING! It's a pleasant experience from start to finish. Brian is the nicest guy on the planet, Dom will make sure your experience is more than perfect, and David can think of a great combination of ice cream on the fly! From the moment you step into Fatty Daddy's, you'll be welcomed with a "WELCOME TO FATTY DADDY'S!"..from that moment on, you're family.   So let's recap: Try everything, get a cookie cup, and leave feeling like family. Sounds like a great experience. I know I had one and will be returning.
