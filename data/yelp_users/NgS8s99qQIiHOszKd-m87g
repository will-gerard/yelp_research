I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!

Serving this much food should be illegal.  Don't go to Claim Jumper if you're not hungry - your stomach will explode!  This is what I miss the most about the West Coast!  Get the Chicken Cobb Sandwich, the potato cakes, the potato cheese soup or the blue cheese wedge you'll be back at least 4x/week!

My friend took me to Amsterdam one night after I'd had a really rough day at work.  We usually frequented the "girl" bars but wanted to see what the guys were working with.  Amsterdam was really nice.  It was clean, it had great decor.  I love the velvet couches and the lounge feel.  I had some kind of special drink that almost put me in a coma.  All I know is it was purple, had fruit in the bottom and tasted like champagne.  It was Major!  I wasn't that crazy about the layout and the dance floor was kinda small.  On the way out a drunk ass guy asked me if I was Queen Latifah and kissed me....Ok!

Barcelona is what Scottsdale is all about.  The best place to go for drinks, listen to music and people watch.  And the happy hour lasts until around 9p!  My friend and I had about 10 berrs and I think our bill was about $30.  About 10 of us went for New Year's Eve 2006 we had dinner and entry to the club for $75/pp.  I love the outdoor patio.  The staff are very polite.  Its just a fun place to go!

Sapporo is the place to go if you don't really want to eat.  Go for Happy Hour to hang out on the patio with the beautiful people in Scottsdale.  My friend and I went for Happy Hour, the bar area was full so we sat at a bar table near the sushi bar.    We'd ordered and were eating when the hostess came over and told us that we were no longer in the "bar area" and that these seats had to be assigned at the hostess station.  She was incredibly rude and pretentious.  The food and the atmosphere are no were near as appealing as RA. The Happy Hour menu was not as extensive and the food wasn't all that great.  We never went back.

E Lounge is really the place to be for a good old girl friendly time.  As a straight chick I never felt anything other than comfortable at E.  And I've never danced so hard in my life.  Its pretty much a dive bar, no frills and the bathroom can get pretty gross.  I usually use the men's room.    My friends and I would be there at least 3 weekends out of a month.  Most nights I came home smelling like smoke with who knows what stuck to the bottom of my shoes but I always had a ball.  6:30p is REALLY early to get there.  We usually arrived around 11p.  I've never had a mixed drink there, but you can get a picture of Heffe for $5.  You can't beat that!
