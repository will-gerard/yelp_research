Second time here and I just have to write a review! The service was alright, great but they were pretty busy! The food came out fast and it was pretty delicious. I love the Udon noodle soup and the shrimp tempura. It's kind of expensive but the food was really good so it was worth it. The lunch specials was still a little on the expensive side but my friend got a chicken katsu and it looked really good. I would come back again (:

I am not Korean so I don't know what "traditional" Korean food taste like. However, I think this place have good and decent Korean food. My friend and I order the seafood pancake and it was actually very good! The outside was crispy and the there was allot of seafood! It was very filling and the pancake was huge! We both also shared a kimchi fried rice with a fried egg on top and it was also very good! I like how the friend rice had those chunks of vegetables and the fried egg added a very savory taste to the rice making it not dry at all.   The service was good could be better but the waiter was nice and the lady came over and gave us some more side dishes. (Side dishes and free refills). The food is not that expensive and they packed allot! It's definitely shareable!   Would definitely come again!

Been here a few times and it's time for a review! Walked in and the nice girl greeted us right away! Although she said she will seat us as soon as all my party was here.  We got seated right away and our server Jesse was very nice and cool! He was very friendly and was willing to explain the menu if we had any questions. My friends and I got the same thing which was #3 the LoLo's with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles.   The food was very good! The chicken came out crispy and very juicy. I got one breast, wing, and a thigh. The chicken tasted pretty good. Can't go wrong with fried chicken here. The waffle was very good too. It wasn't too soft or hard. Just perfect waffles to eat.   I would definitely come back. Perhaps maybe try their breakfast menu.

The food here is really good! The prices are really cheap and the portion size are enough to feed 3 people. The lady is SUPER nice, but she just needs to be more attentive..   I would come here once in awhile not all the time cause you can get really tired of eating the same type of foods.   In conclusion, the food was good, came out really fast. I would come here again.

Wow, I have never encounter such rude customer service before. I went to the drive through to order and repeat my order to "Rosey" and she was so rude. She gave me attitude and said "yeah that's what I said." But she didn't even read my order correct. At the drive through she gave us our food and swing the bag causing all the sauce to spill. Slam the door and stared us away. I am never going back to Panda Express and I will report this to her corporate/district manager...

This place was recommended by a close friend because he works here. Came here and it was during their lunch specials time. My friend and I both got their Bento B lunch combo, and my other friend tried their Ramen special.   The food was cheap, Bento box range from 9-15 dollars depending on what you get. The Ramen wasn't anything special. The Bento box was cheap but the food quality could be better. The sushi didn't taste that fresh... But it was edible. I would give their sushi 7/10.   Although the food wasn't anything special the restaurant was very nice a modernized. The designs was very nice and the service was beyond great!   I would come back again but I will probably not get the Bento box again and try something else. Perhaps maybe their specialty sushi would possibly taste better and more fresh.

I absolutely love their sushi! It's very good! Although once they are very busy they tend to take a little longer but it wasn't that bad. The sushi was great! The spicy udon pasta noodle is so yummy. The price is a little on the expensive side but it was worth it to me. Definitely recommend this place (:

My new favorite place! The food here is excellent! It was my first time coming here with my friends who love it here. I tried the Hummus trio from the Tapas happy hour menu and a burger (i forgot the name of). Our server was very attentive and the vibe at the Pita Jungle is super chill! Definitely try it if you are thinking about it

I was very hesitant whether to give them 3 stars or 4... Here's why.   I love wings, especially coming here so often I love their lemon pepper wings. Their wings are just a hit and miss sometimes. Sometimes, they take FOREVER and sometimes the service is really quick. Everyone here is pretty much straight forward... Not nice and not mean. They are there to just take your order and cook it for you. Tables don't really get clean and the size of the restaurant is pretty small. As for the food, it just wings. Nothing special.. They do have good wings. Its just basic sauce for wings, mild, medium, hot, buffalo, bbq. Although, their dry wings are the best I've encountered. My favs are Louisiana Rub and Lemon Pepper.

I'm not Hawaiian so I don't know what "real" Hawaiian food taste like. I assume it taste like this place, cause the food here so very good! The meats are very well marinated, and the rice is cook just right! Their macaroni salad is so good! Katsu chicken is so crunchy and good! I like this place better than Ono Hawaiian. The only problem is their seatings.. Sometimes it gets really busy in their and there are no space to sit and eat. I normally get it Togo cause the place is too small.   Anyways, would definitely come back!

I use to love this place so much but idk if they switch owners or whatever but it's horrible now. The drinks takes forever to make! For that price I rather go to Jamba Juice for better quality. They take forever to make the drinks and most of the time the drink comes out all gross and too much ice was blended in it.   The most disgusting part is I was standing right in the front when one the girl was making my drink and then dip her finger in the smoothie and stir it around on top trying to remove the smoothie that was spilling over.   Immediately I threw my drink out didn't even bother waiting for another drink cause seriously they take FOREVER to make one drink. I can't imagine them making two drinks and waiting for that..

Seriously hands down the best tacos yet!!! The tacos here is so good and very affordable. Only tried the Asada Tacos so I can only speak for it. The tacos is so good! Guacamole is so creamy and the meat is very well marinated. It's pretty small so I usually get like 4-6 tacos depending on how hungry you are. I heard the burritos is also very good. Came here two times only and I already love it here. Will definitely come again. As for service, it wasn't anything special they were polite and just take orders. The wait is pretty long. Usually 10-15 minutes for your order.

I go to Mekong plaza allot but was very hesitant on trying this place! Finally I was introduced by a few friends and the food is actually good! The soup was very savory and the portion is huge!! They have allot of noodles and they have a build you own menu too! It was my first time there so I let my friend order for me and then I added on extra sides onto my bowl for 1$ extra. My bowl was still cheap! They don't have a large variety for drinks though. The cup is so tiny and I feel like they are very stingy with their drinks. I asked for more water and it was never done. The service was ok. Not the best service.... I had to keep repeating myself... Kinda annoyed by that. After they drop off your food you're basically on your own. I would come back again and try something else, but I have a feeling this place will tick you off if you're really high with service, cause it's not that great here.

I absolutely love the vibe here! It's so modern and the service are just amazing! I did some research before coming in so I already know what I wanted. But the girl at the counter as all ready and about to explain the menu to me cause I told it was my first time. She was so nice and helpful.   The food itself was very good! The crust was a little hard to chew on but the sandwich itself was a must have! It so good, the break is very soft and crispy, nothing fell out of my sandwich, and it also came with a side of your choice!   I would definitely come back here. Love it!

Their drinks are so good. The location is great but I live all the way in west valley... This place cannot be compared to other boba in town. Hands down the best place for hangouts, drinking milk tea, ice tea, and deserts. Love their house blend special and mango ice tea!

Whoa! I have never had such a good breakfast! This place is really good!! I got the The Five Spot which is a breakfast sandwich and I added a side of hash brown.  And wow, the hash brown is so good. It so creamy and crispy!!! The sandwich itself was ok. I liked the sandwich but I felt like I could make it at home. Although the bread is pretty good.  I tried the bacon and it's so crispy!!!   Overall, this place is really good. Got seated right away and the manager here he is so nice. Good service, good food, and good vibes. Will definitely come back soon

First off, the service is way more than excellent. I love the lady in the front. She is so nice to everyone.  Second, the boba (tapioca balls) are much better than other boba place in Arizona. It's allot sweeter and more chewy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Third, the drinks are excellent! I've tried allot of drinks and jasmine milk tea is my favorite! They are also known for their house special but if you decide to get the house special make sure to mix it up really well or else you'll just taste ice and boba.   In conclusion, I would come here more than the other boba place. But the only thing that is inconvenient is their hours ):

Got myself a Pho Oxtail and its honestly so bland and gross... Pho taste like they threw a bunch of MSG in it.. I've tasted better Pho Oxtail... Their oxtail was not cook in the Pho broth. Just by tasting the oxtail and looking at it, you can already tell that they boiled their oxtail instead of cooking in the broth with seasoning...   The wait was about 10 minutes.. Not the best service was given but I guess it was alright. Was not greeted well when I came in....   $11.91 for Pho Oxtail! That is unbelievable high price for Pho. Omg..... They are making more than any profit their getting....   Sorry, would not come back..

Wow! I'm so glad my friends and I stop by this place! Came in and we were greeted very professionally and got seated right away. We had 2 servers taking care of us, Mary and another Asian lady. They were both very nice and sweet! We started ordering and when our sushi came out the rice was purple! I started thinking "omg what the heck, it's not gonna be good." I was wrong! It was the best sushi I had so far! The rice was so soft and the tuna was so fresh. We also order Gyoza and those were pretty good. More sushi came out and let me say, they were all good! I love it here. The vibe is very nice and the decorations were very modern. Great service, fair price for sushi, I will definitely come back again!

I've been here several times and I think it's time for a review!  This place have very good tea! Their milk tea are okay... But I tried the mango green tea and it was very good. I also took a sip of my friend passion fruit tea and it was also good! The teas here are the best so far I encounter.   The only problem I have is their consistency. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's on the bad side. Personally that's how I feel since I've been here a couple of times morning, afternoon, and night.   The drinks are good but they need to fix their consistency.

My second review because I'm very upset...  Omg the service here is so horrible. I understand that this place is trying to be different with their styles with their drinks, but I went in and ordered green milk tea and the girl was so nice and ask what style I want. I said what? Styles? She said that there is a healthy style and boba style... I'm like hmm interesting... So I said boba style cause honestly what is healthy style???   Then I told the owner I ordered green tea but on the cup it said jasmine...so I asked the owner if it was the same thing and she started explaining all her teas in like an attitude way without offering a replacement on my drink (which I told her I didn't like). I was being honest about how I felt about how nasty my drink was and she still going on about how her drinks is unique or whatever..  Like I'm sorry I don't understand your complicated menu... The owner is just pure rude with no customer service.   I immediately threw my drink in the trash and she stand behind the counter and starts calling for me telling me to come over to her. I didn't get an apology and she still going on about her different style in teas. Like omg your wasting my time either say sorry or offer a new drink.   Although her employees are much more nice and more professional than the boss.   I will never order a drink here again. Everything here is just to complicated and this is not my first time ordering a drink. Their consistency is not good at all.   1 star for the rudeness of the owner and my drink that honestly tasted like Ensure milk mixed with jasmine or green tea whatever it is... Gross..

So I finally gave in and try this place! It was very pleasant and the service was very nice! The crepe isn't all that wow but the macaroons were very tasty and sweet! The green tea ice was good, the environment was very relaxed and the place is very clean! I would come back again but for macaroons only! (: great place!

I'm so glad they open around the area. Now we don't have to drive all the way to Tempe. Went there for the first time and it was an hour wait... But our service sucks for some reason that night. The girl sat us down and took our order after that she didn't assign a waiter/waitress to us so no one help us throughout our meal! We needed water and that couldn't even be filled...Although some girl started to come over and she was so friendly! I guess the place doesn't have bad service its probably because they are so busy that day. The manager seemed really nice and all!! (: The food was good and all but I think Mill ave is better...4 stars for the food!

Wow the guy is so rude!!!!!!  I came in a saw a sign for 2 slice pizza for 5.25 and I was amaze at how cheap it was! So I ordered 2 slice and added toppings for 25 cents each. Then he said my total was 11.50 and I was like I thought it was 5.25 for 2 slice? He said no... And then say "whatever just give me 10.50" I'm like excuse me I want to understand before I pay for it and he said no it's 5.25 each! I'm like then I just want one slice. He said again "just give me 10.50" and I said 1 slice only!   As for the pizza itself it's not even that special. This is not even New York style pizza.  Will not come back again. Rude service and complicated menu.

This is the place! Best breakfast I've encountered so far on the west side. First off, we were greeted right away as soon as we came through the door. Our waitress, Cassidy was super nice. She had allot of tables to take care but manage to be very professional and apologetic about the wait but we didn't even waited that long.  The food arrived really early! It was fresh and very warm. You can already tell that the food was prepared very well. I got the chicken fried steak and it was so good! The gravy had little chunks of sausages and that tasted so well together. I also tried my friend chorizo and it was also the best thing ever. I will definitely come back here again. The location was very easy to find. Love this place!

I've been a long term customer here at Angry Crab Shack. I've tried all their locations and this location seemed pretty good, despite the booty short hostess who was very rude to some customers and made a scene behind our table. Prior to that, she was very rude at the front already. She seemed upset for not having menus for my friends and I. The booty shorts girl rolled her eyes threw down one menu she had in her hands and said "let me go get more menus" in such a snotty way.   The wait was about 45 minutes on a Friday night. Not that bad for a wait....  Our waitress Jinifer was fantastic! She had such great customer service. Was very fast with waters, getting my ranch, and limes. She was very enjoyable.   The food was good and average just like their other locations. The flavors are great and the shrimp was very savory!  The food arrived very fast and and my friends and I went ham immediately. Yummms.  Anyways, will come back again but the booty shorts girl will probably get on my nerves again so she needs to fix it or go.
