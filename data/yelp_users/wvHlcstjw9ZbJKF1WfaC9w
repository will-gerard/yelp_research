Need more front office staff! Horrible customer service both on the phone and in person.  Both my appointments were 30-60mins late. One of my appointments they told me they were running about 1 hour behind. One person waiting told me that he was waiting 1 hour for just to get heartworm medicine. Everyone waiting seems really annoyed and you can tell they have been waiting a long time or they have not even been helped at all.   My 2nd appointment I refused to wait 1 hour past MY appointment time. I told the front office lady that I was not able to wait. She was very smug with me and told me there was nothing she could do. So I walked out.  My first appointment my dog need to get some stitches out so whisked her away leaving me in the waiting area and in 2 mins brought her back and said they took them out saying everything looks good. There was no talking to the veterinarian. Is the veterinarian even looking at my dog??? I dont care how small my dogs cut is Im paying you $300 for all my visits and for a VET! Especially running a hour behind yup dont think she looked at him. I was really annoyed.  The staff seems like they over book patients (obviously) and I see all the parents in the waiting area. Doesnt seem to be any use of the exam rooms or interaction much with the veterinarian from what I see.  I am disappointed  because this vet is close to the home but I much rather drive twice as far to have a on time appointment with a nicer more personable staff.  I DO NOT recommend Banfield Hospital especially the one in Surprise.  I will def be finding a nice neighborhood vet!

This review is based off the NEW GOODYEAR LOCATION (Pebble Creek and McDowell) They have only been open couple weeks new so no yelp page is made for them yet I guess. But my family and I ate there last night 12/2/13 for my fianc√©s birthday and my dad got food Poisoning for the roasted chicken. He was violently sick all last night and into today. He ended going to the doctor and The doctor did confirm food poisoning. We did check the left over chicken in the refrigerator we had brought home and the chicken was very red. Make sure the Chicken is cooked!!! Will never order chicken here!! And probably will not be a top choice of restaurants to eat at in my neighborhood. Again this is for the GOODYEAR LOCATION.

I took my car in that needed new brakes. I did have them talk to my husband on the phone. Being a girl I wanted to be sure they were not doing nothing more that was necessary. We did have a coupon. But they kept trying to sell me premium expensive brakes that I couldn't afford. They seemed irritated. So they said it would be 2 hours. About a month goes by and I noticed some grinding noises to my brakes. Even when I got my oil changed, after getting the new brake pads, the mechanic said I should get them checked. So my husband and I took the car back explained what we were hearing and what the mechanic said. Waited an hour and they said everything is fine. "Dodge just has a bad break system. We could put premium brakes on for you and that would help." Of course we said no if they said the brakes were fine. So went another couple months and I then became a uber driver. So I took my car to a certified mechanic to be inspected. They came back and said my break pads were very low and that I needed new rotors. I explained that I just got new brake pads and the whole story. His reaction scared me, "And they didn't recommend new rotors?!?!" I continued to explain the horrible customer service that we received from them and what they had told us said and He just shook his head and was at a loss for words.  All I wanted was affordable brake pads at a place we could trust.  Now I'm going to have to spend even more money that I don't have to be able to get this solved so I can use my car for work to pay for bills.

My family and I love D&B but today the upstair sitting area to eat was horrible service. They had like 8 tables free but all dirty and not cleaned up from previous customers. We are sitting here watching no service anywhere. We are still sitting here after 20 mins with no service at all. Talked to bartender twice now to get us a server seems they cant find one either.

My hubby and I LOVE Sushi. We have been all over the valley and we have our favorites. This place is definitely NOT our favorite. Wont be coming back. Prices are too high for quality. Came for Happy Hour and Their menu for it sucks. They have like 5 rolls no one wants on it. Too much rice on rolls. Rolls are loose and fall apart easy. And overall taste of the sushi was EH. Paid $44 for 2 people on HH. Tomo near by is much better!!

Play ALWAYS sucks on printing things!! Second time coming here and the orders are NEVER ready. They always have someone working behind the counter who doesnt look like they know what they are doing. And look at you with blank face about the order. Another customers order was not ready either. And was annoyed. I had even received the email as I was standing there saying my order was ready. Who is sending me confirmations when its not ready??? So now waiting to get it printed where a manager has to show her how to do it. Never coming to this staples!! I will never come here again!! Only reason I gave them two stars is because they gave me my business cards for free. Thank you!

My family and I have been here a few times. And we will for sure be continuing to go back. This Restaurant has amazing food!! Staff is really nice!! Its hard to recommend any one dish because honestly everything is so good!  If you are ever looking for a private big group event this is also a great place. I had my husbands 30th surprise bday party here. They gave us the outside patio. Owner and staff were very helping and went above and beyond making sure it was nice.  I only had a hour during day to decorate. So i could not go over to many details on how I wanted things set up. I really wanted it too look nice and it set up a certain way. But when we arrived that night it was awesome. Staff put white table clothes on tables. Buffet table was set up nice. They also had a table with with wine, wine glasses, cake accessories. It was great. Big Thank you to owner and staff for a great night! :)

Last Weekend we had a group of 12 people for dinner for my Birthday. It was SO good!! Appetizers, dinners and drinks were great! Our whole party couldn't stop taking about the food and how they wanted to go back. Service was good as well and the restaurant is a nice modern sheik decor that was a nice ambience.  I highly recommend this restaurant.

Dont come here for Football!! At least on Saturdays. Came to watch the ASU game along with half the bar wearing football apparel. And they have loud music and cut the main screen off for karaoke. Really Karaoke??? Its football season!!!!! So annoyed. So we are scarfing our food down to take off to a bar that has the game with sound on. No more booty for us during football season!

This place sucks!! I was SO excited for Tobys to FINALLY opened and I gave them credit with all the issues they had opening weekend to give them a break ok new employees learning the ropes of a packed house.  But even just a week ago when me and 2 of my friends went to HH at 4:30 on a MONDAY service still sucked. There were seriously only 10 other in the entire Huge restaurant. I had to flag down the bartender to get service or refills. They were just standing around talking not paying attention to customers. Even a customer next to me who I didnt know looked at me and mouthed "Service here sucks" as they saw I was frustrated again having to flag the bartender down again.  Also the bartender when asked how certain foods were said he DID NOT recommend them! LMAO!! Who does that!?!? He didnt recommend a couple appetizers. One being the nachos with certain things on it.  I was just like WOW you work for a restaurant and you yourself are giving bad reviews to customer on your food. Not good. Looked really bad on the restaurant.  I also noticed crowds have gone down and Im not surprised with the bad service. I have yet to talk to someone who has something good about service here. I think they need to hire more then just pretty faces and actual people who know how to serve.

Do not go if you have a big group. They will Refuse you!! Who refuses business!?!? Sure maybe they did have a full house. But 9pm on a hot summer night. Not sure.... I am not sure I will go back or recommend this place. Citiscape is right across the street. So plenty more options. Grrr..

We went for the first time before a movie late on a Sunday night. We were greeted by the Manager who was very nice. Shook our hands and introduced himself. The bartender Cody was awesome. Very attentive! Even when he didn't respond to me looking over at him because I needed a refill he was very apologetic. "So sorry I even saw you looking over!" I didn't wait long at all. Will def go back. Great customer service.

So I'm glad I'm not off on seeing the horrible customer service here. Love bringing my son here to play games. But if you are planning on eating in or sitting at bar. Except horrible service. Went one day with family on Valentines day. Yes it was busy. We were walking around playing games w son. Decided to head to bar for couple beers and soda. Stood on one side waiting no service. Walked around found 2 empty seats. Ok now they will see us! Nope. Bartender down the way talking w customers glanced our way. Never came. After about 10 mins walked around to other side again. Stood for about 5 mins. By this time getting highly annoyed. Thing is there were plenty of people standing around that could of helped. Mean while i noticed a girl at a bar top storm off to get her own menu and complaining about the service. Finally manager asks if I need something. I told her she had the worst service behind the bar. And that I've been waiting over 15 mins. She apologized got our drinks. And did not charge us. We are now at our second visit to eat because we received a free entree coupon. Bartenders before even looking at coupon denied it. Then seemed annoyed taking it. Ugh. You think w all the complaints they would retrain in customer service.
