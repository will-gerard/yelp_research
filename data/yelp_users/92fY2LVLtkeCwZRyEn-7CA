Love Goldie's we always have a wonderful time and great service. They have great weekday deals and their Goldieritas can't be beat! Wouldn't go anywhere else to get my sports fix and great food.

So I am only giving them 2 stars because every single time I come here they try to up sell you on everything! Yes they do a good job washing the car and their prices are decent for Scottsdale. But the hassle that you have to go through just to get a basic wash, no I don't want to detail my car, no I don't care about that chip you say is in my window that is barely noticeable, no I don't want to condition my leather seats, I came here for a basic car wash and that's all I want. Not to mention the guys make you feel like a total bi*** for not buying the extras. I will probably stop coming here and just wash my car on my own because of the giant hassle it has become.

I've been here twice now and have had horrible service both times. This most recent time I ordered the sea bass which was very good but not worth the over hour wait for it. The rest of the table was served and my entree was forgotten. The waiter blamed the kitchen and the food runner, the food runner blamed the server - but nothing irks me more when people don't just take responsibility for messing up. If you don't mind horrible service, wait staff who doesn't clear your plates, and waiting over an hour for your food while the rest of the table eats then go to the bamboo club.

Came here with my boyfriend on valentines day after I read a review that said to skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco (where we were originally going) and come here instead.  I am SO glad that we did!!! Our waiter James was absolutely amazing - very attentive, and knows a lot about the menu - you can tell he is very passionate about this restaurant and likes his job.  We ordered Bruschetta for our starter and it was absolutely amazing.  I don't even like tomatos and I couldn't get enough of their bruschetta board.  We then split a pizza as you can order half and half - I ordered their Trufeta (splg?) pizza - it has truffle oil - and is absolutely to die for!  We finished the night with a strawberry nutella crepe also very delicious.  We talked about this restaurant, the great service, the great food, and the great ambience for the rest of the night; and then took our friends there the following week.  Wish I lived closer I would go every day if I could.  Definitely skip the wait at Pizzeria Bianco and come here instead, the atmosphere is cozier, the wait staff is friendlier, and I think the pizza is way better!

One star because the food was actually good when we got it, unfortunately the service was so god awful I will never return. Were they busy? Absolutely. However I have never had such bad service. When we first sat down a couple different waitresses came up to our table, they couldn't figure out who was going to have our table. Once this was settled we got chips and guac which came pretty quickly however nobody came back to the table until we were good and done with the appetizer. We finally order dinner, 20-25 mins goes by and the waitress comes by to see if we needed anything else, she didn't even realize we hadn't gotten our food and was gone so quickly we couldn't tell her. 40-45 mins has gone by and she finally comes back to see if we were ready for the check to which we laughed and said we had yet to get our food. The waitress blames the kitchen takes our order again (taco salad and 2 tacos with rice and beans) and finally 10 mins later we get our food. But wait, the tacos are not anything close to what my friend had ordered. The waitress comped our dinners but still handed us a bill for the guac and one margarita. It seems nobody in that restaurant knows what they are doing, and I sadly will never go back. Don't waste your time with the God awful service.

Love this place!!! Order it for take out pretty regularly - my moms boyfriend says the Egg Foo Young is die for, and I have never ordered a dish from them I haven' t liked.  They are very reasonably priced, and very frequently have a groupon now for 20 bucks for 30 dollars worth of food.  If your craving some great chinese food definitely give them a chance.

First off this place should have a way higher rating then 3 stars. Came here because my boyfriend bought a travelzoo deal and the food and margaritas were awesome. We both had seafood enchiladas and split a tostada appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. This restaurant also has a great taco Tuesday deal 1.50 shredded beef tacos and 2 dollar tecates. Will definitely be back again.

My girlfriends and I stumbled across Crust on one girls night while looking for a great place close by to get some food.  We were very pleasantly surprised - this place is very cute and the food is awesome.  The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for, I had the steak sandwich, and my friend had the pizza with pasta on top of it - both were so so so good!!!  Pretty reasonably priced and the food and wine is delicious!!!

My boyfriend and I have been looking for some amazing mexican food and we found it. Had to wait a little bit to get the food but it was well worth the wait! The nachos were out of this world and the burrito and quesadillas were amazing. Definitely will be back!!!

I could not be more disappointed by this place! I purchased a shampoo for the interior of my car because the sales guy said it would only take 20 minutes - what a complete joke when it took over an hour. This would have been fine if the car was actually clean! When all was said and done my car still has dog hair on the backseat - that I was able to get off with just a lint roller. I will not be going back.

If I could give this place less than one star I would - horrible service and they kept people waiting for over 1/2 hour with about 10 tables open. We finally left in frustration an went to the Mexican restaurant down the street - should have started there and skipped this place all together.
