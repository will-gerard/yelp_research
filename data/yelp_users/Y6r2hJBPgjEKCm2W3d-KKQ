Easily one of the coolest bars in Phoenix. I've been coming here for  years, and the service, crowd, and ambience are always cool.

Came home from a family vacation thinking we'll grab some McDonald's for the kids since it was late and had work and preschool the next morning. Turned down Wendy's, In N Out, and Burger King for the kids. Big Mistake.  Service was bad and the food was cold.   My advice: find another McDonald's if you must have it or go some place else before you go to this place. Plain terrible. Gave me the wrong burger and it was cold. The fries were also cold. They must be trying to see if they can be the worst fast food restaurant in the area. They are number 1 in terrible.

It was my first time here last night because my girlfriend had a gift card that she received from work, and the food and service was excellent.  We started with salads; I had the Italian tossed salad which was exactly the way it was described on the menu. The vegetables were fresh and crispy. My girlfriend had the Caesar; she ate all of it.   We then had the mussels with the spicy sauce. It was a little spicier than the server claimed, but we like spicy. Obviously the salad was supposed to come out first, but our server had the smarts to bring the salads first because the mussels take longer. The mussels were good, but the sauce was boss.  For entrees, I had the braised brisket cannelloni and my girlfriend had the chicken Parmesan. The cannelloni is one of the best pasta dishes I've had. The chicken Parmesan had a very nice and crispy breading with juicy meat inside. I like my chicken Parmesan with more sauce and cheese, but it was my girlfriend's dish and she loved it the way it was.  Our server's name was Jorge and he provided some of the best service ever! Great dinner, great service, with a great girl. We'll be back.

So many rave reviews. I like this place. It's pretty good and it's always consistent. Consistency is very difficult to manage for a barbecue restaurant in my opinion. Although I don't believe it is the best barbecue joint in town, it is the best I've had on the East side.  I always get the brisket and chicken. The turkey sausages aren't spicy enough for me, but their sides are pretty good. I like the .25 coffee, and you eat free on your birthday.

I went here last night prepared to make it rain. After five death metal songs a dancer asks, "how are you?" I replied, "I hate the music." She then called me an asshole. I asked for the manager. Manager says, "she's outside crying because you didn't like her music." She then offered to buy me a drink. I declined, went home, and thought, "stripper breezies are crazy!"   I kinda liked it in spite of the bad music and emotionally fragile dancer. The bartender, Keisha, was cool and there was one cute dancer. Music improved as I was leaving.  Who really listens to death metal while chillin?

I drink coffee daily and have lived in the Pacific Northwest for the past ten years for background purposes.   In regards to the Not So Mighty Cup. The coffee is good, but overpriced. The service is below average.  With that being said, if I lived around the corner I would probably come here. Thank the Creator I don't live in downtown Glendale.

First time that I had Shepherd's Pie. It was good and filling. They told me that real shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb; that's how they make it here. It went well with a pint of Guinness. I will definitely come back and try the corned beef and cabbage.   Bartender was cool, service was great, food was good, and beer was cold. I'm a fan.

I went here on a Sunday night after reading all of the good reviews. The night that I went, they were serving a Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe menu. For those of you who don't know, Mrs. White's is The Original Soul Food Restaurant in Central Phoenix. She is also the mother of Larry "Lo Lo" White, the owner of LoLo's Chicken and Waffles (currently the best chicken and waffle joint in the USA). With that being said, the food was great, the service was impeccable, and the wine selection was good. Simply put, the guest chef idea is a great one. I can't wait to return; I believe that this will be my Sunday night dinner joint when in town. The Five Stars is for Sunday nights; it is as good as it gets.

Slow, inefficient, and poor service. I walk in, no greeting, and no instruction. I wait for someone to come available. Customer service agent finishes with one customer and calls another. I ask if there is a place to check in. She points at the manager. I go to him and ask if I can exchange a product. He puts me on the list.   I go to find the product I need to exchange and wait. As I'm waiting, I observe the three customer service agents assisting other customers. They are dealing with major issues. I need to exchange one product for another that I located on the shelf myself. Why can't I exchange my product without waiting in a line of customer issues?  Why isn't there one person designated to deal with simple business transactions? Ridiculous. I had to WAIT 20minutes to exchange a product.

5 Stars for the $20 bottle and bruschetta deal. It really doesn't get any better than that. However, my favorite meals here are lunch and the weekend brunch. The soups and sandwiches are delicious and the farm scramble is tasty. Great alternative for the two restaurants across the streets. Oh, and the mimosas aren't bad either.

This is the best pool bar outside of Scottsdale. Came here with a couple of hot chicks (Keke and Ashley) for drinks. I had the turkey burger because I was starving. It was a little on the burnt side; we'll call it cajun style. The french fries are the bomb, and the drinks were good. Service was pretty good.  I need to come back on a weekend. I heard they have a DJ

Awesome! If you like real Chicago style dogs and Italian beef sandwiches, this is THE place.

This is my favorite bar/club in AZ! If you're in town and you are cool, you should come here. The management and staff are great!

As I write this review, I am eating a leftover beef short rib that I purchased last Friday (4 days ago). It is still tender, juicy, and delicious.   This is the best barbecue that I've ever had in my life and I eat barbecue. My family owns a barbecue restaurant in East Texas so I grew up on barbecue to say the least.   Until I came to Little Miss Barbecue, my favorite all-time brisket was Franklin's in Austin, TX. Little Miss Barbecue has changed my life.
