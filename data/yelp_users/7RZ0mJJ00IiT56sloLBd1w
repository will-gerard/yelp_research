I was craving wet fries (fries with brown gravy on them - you should definitely try this) and a black & white malted. So, we hopped in the car and drove the 15 miles or so down to the Diner.  Glanced at the menu, but didn't need much time. The menu has all the staples from back in the day when we were regulars at 2am after work. Ordered wet fries, malt, cherry/vanilla coke, Blue Moon Burger & French Dip.  Tossed a quarter in the jukebox at the table, then found out the wheel to flip thru the pages was stuck. Moved to a different table, tossed a quarter in as the flipper worked, played 2 songs only to figure out that the volume switch on this one didn't work. Back to Table 1. Waitress came by and informed us that the table jukes aren't always reliable (if at all) and to use the main juke for best results. I told her she should call "the guy" and seems it had never occurred to the staff that there must be a guy that works on this kinda stuff...  Anyway, juke fiasco aside - the food was good. Wet fries and fountain drinks is why we were really there. No complaints on either. You can check it out 24hrs a day, so whenever is convenient for you; stop in!  Upon leaving, I noticed they have a shiny food truck parked in the lot - not sure where you can find this around town, but keep your eyes open for it!

This place has been around a long time, and I've been there quite a few times. It's hard to find decent Cajun food in Phoenix, but Kay's usually does pretty well.  Our last visit wasn't the greatest. The duck & andouille gumbo was nice, if not quite piping hot. I forgave that, as it's one of the few places around you cna find duck of any kind, or andouille for that matter. The shrimp etouffe came out stone cold, and the waitress quickly returned it to the kitchen where they nuked it to almost hot. Microwaved etouffee just isn't right.   An order of dirty rice with a side of 2 links of andouille proved almost pointless, as we specifically made clear this was an entree, and expected the 2 links to be cut up and added to the rice. What we got was a small bowl of dirty rice with two tiny breakfast-sized links laid atop it.    The crab cakes weren't bad, being mostly crab with little bread crumbs, but they really didn't scream authentic cajun cakes to me. Plus, they too were a bit on the cold side - even though everything came out quickly.   On the plus side, they have Abita beers on tap. Turbo Dog is always welcomed - especially if it's on tap.   Another plus is you can stop in on a weekend night (we went on a Saturday) even at 9p and they are open. The place was empty barring a few people at the bar. That should be your clue.   My previous experiences here were all around lunchtime, with no problems as far as food temp, so I suspect that late night diners are getting food that has been sitting around in a steamer all day long.   Regardless, I am only giving this 2 stars. Your mileage may vary.

Hey, some of us still like to RENT movies, rather than buy them or watch them streamed. (Can you say compression artifacts?)  It's the closest one to me, now that my "local" one was closed during the bankruptcy. I have no probs with this store at all. I get my movies in the mail, and I trade them in here for other ones.   They don't have a GREAT selection of obscure foreign flicks, but its pretty decent. Same for old-school horror flicks.  They also usually have a copy or two of the latest Fangoria and Rue Morgue magazines. They also carry a number of tattoo-related mags like Bound By Ink (I'm not sure why - but they do).  It's also where I usually pick up a couple of Mexican Cokes. No, whatever "deal of the day" they are having on snack items and drink combos does NOT apply to these. Too bad.

When a place is done RIGHT they get 5 stars! FP is about a 4 star place, but there are several things that give them that bonus star...  1. They have giant framed artwork, yes - with glass. As a photographer - I know what that costs, so anyone willing to spend $$ on glass that big gets a thumbs up. 2. They have cool brass sculptures and other assorted Chinese decorations. 3. They have DUCK! It's Crispy Duck, not Peking - but NOBODY in Phx has Peking Duck, right? Whatever...they have duck and it was served up nice and crisp with a hint of 5 spice. It wasn't even a problem that we were the first people in the doors at Noon (thats when they open on Sundays. Double Bonus Points.) 4. They DO Mu Shu. Note: I didn't say they HAVE Mu Shu. The server does it old school and stuffs your pancakes right their, tableside with chopsticks. BAM. TRIPLE BONUS POINTS. 5. They have old-school cocktails on the menu...like a Singapore Sling and Zombies. We didn't partake, but its cool that they have 'em!  The food is good, the menu offers just about every variation of everything - chicken, pork, beef, lobster, scallops...however you want them...spicy, hot/sour, cashews, almonds...whatever.   Prices are pretty good (really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tso's Chicken for fans of that! That's pretty rare. If I was a Tso fan, I'd double bonus point that - but, as you can tell - I'm a duck fan: so only single bonus points there.  The hot tea was fresh and tasty. The servers are friendly, the food is quickly prepared. Even the takeout menu is really nice! Good glossy paper stock, nice graphic design, with flamingos watermarked into it. Well written, good layout.   There you have it. Five freakin stars baby, coun't em. Attention to detail matters, restauranteurs! Brings you up a star in my book, and I know it counts with other Yelpers!

I have no complaints. I am new to the world of vision correction. The staff, and Dr. Meek are great. They talked with me, made me feel comfortable and didn't pressure me into high $ frames or lens upgrades.  They have a decent selection of frames, the office is comfortable, and the people are nice.   There IS an elevator, if you can't do stairs. It's to the left as you look at the building.

Now that's a good tamale!   It was only one of the three items in my combo - the others were a beef taco and a cheese enchilada. All were tasty, but the tamale (beef-machaca?) took the prize on that plate. Beans and rice were both decent and then I sprinkled on some of the magic dust that was in a shaker on the table. BAM! Awesome spice that seemed to be a mixture of red pepper flakes, chili powder and perhaps a touch of cayenne. Nice. Another sprinkle jar on the table was some nice, fresh Mexican Oregano. All of that was washed down with a full half liter of Mexican Coke. I'm not sure why so many places are now importing Mexi-coke, but I like it. This si the only place I know of that is using the 1/2 liter botles that are returnable.   Once again, this place features Mexi-coke, but offers Pepsi on the fountain for Coca-cola haters. As much as I like Pepsi, I still gotta have the glass-bottled Cokes. I wish more places would also import the Mexi-Pepsi!  Athena had the Chile Relleno, which she said was very good but perhaps could have used a bit more flavoring in the batter.  The salsas were fresh, but as with almost every salsa these days, it has been gringo-ized and could definitely use more kick. The hot isn't that hot, and it's of the chipotle variety. Is it too hard to make some pico de gallo and toss in a bunch of serranos? Heck - just mince up some serranos and offer them on the salsa bar.  One more note: if you are dining in, there are fresh, tasty tortilla chips available under the heat lamp at the salsa bar.

If you are looking for Southwestern/Mexican/Latino ingredients at a killer price - look no further. They have all the spices and peppers you want. They have all the meat selections you probably won't find at the other supermarkets (tongue/hooves/oxtail). Plenty of queso brands and styles.   They have a tortilleria, and their salsa frescas are pretty good. Now, if I could just get down there before they sell out of Xtra-hot Hatch chiles, I'd be happy. Those puppies go fast!

We got there just in time! Apparently we were getting the last two sandwiches of the day at 3pm. Probably the last slices of bread(?). I went for a ham-sausage I have never tried and it was mighty tasty. Athena had pastrami which wasn't too salty and not too peppery.   Great food, excellent service. Meats are imported - sausages made on premises. For either, I think you'd be hard pressed to even match the prices for non-imported stuff at the supermarket! We spent about $15 on sammies and $30 on deli meats and polish pickles.   Everyone says the sammies are large - nobody has mentioned that they are large because they give you TWO of them! That's 2 sammies per order on a sourdough-type crusty sliced bread. Nice. Have one there (if they have a table open) and take the other home for later!  Oh yeah, they have a Yelp! sticker on the door...

If you've never been to a brewpub, then maybe the shiny casks behind the windows will intrigue you and you'll be overwhelmed by the awesomeness of the idea of a brewpub as you ask your server what they have that is like bud light.  If you are looking for great craft beer, theres more and more brewpubs popping up around town which are worth your attention.

Yes, this review pretty much only applies to the Cine Capri. However, the other theatres here are pretty nice, and the gourmet snack bar has plenty of goodies.   This is not the original Cine Capri, unfortunately. That one met its fate as the curtain closed on The Titanic. Really...that was the last thing the original showed.  Anyhow - this one is designed similar to the original, same big room and a 30'*70' screen. Yes, it has the gold waterfall curtains. Yes, the seats are updated a la Harkins rocker-style. Yes, the sound system is multi-channel (the original was also if you waited a couple of weeks into Star Wars. Perhaps you saw it in both Stereo and Multi-channel if you went twice.)  No, Harkins did NOT drag the 70mm projector over here from the original. BOO.  Yes, they still open the curtain as the Feature starts (but it is open during the previews and they close it only momentarily just to re-open it). WTF?  The theatre is nice, big and more of a place to hit up when you are going to see an "event" picture. Anything directed by Cameron, Coppola, Scorcese, etc. would qualify.   It is NOT a good place to check your email, text your buddies, or comfort your baby.   This is a theatre destination, not a place to kill 2 hours. If you wanna kill a couple hours - hit up one of the smaller screens  to watch Scary Movie 27.

The Cine Capri now features a  Dolby Atmos sound system. Its one of 37 in the US that have it so far, but expect it to catch on! It is 64 discrete channels of surround, allowing sounds to be placed with pinpoint precision in 3-dimensional space.  Many of the speakers are now directly overhead - allowing for accurate portrayals of rainfall, or awesome jet flyovers. There's also around a dozen in the back - so if there is ever a Twister 2, you'll be able to be INSIDE the tornado, sonically at least.   No, they Don't show 3d flicks at the Capri, if you want to see a 3d version of the flick, you can catch it in one of the many other theatres here, sans Dolby Atmos and giant screen.  Projection system is as good as ever, maybe better. If you are a techno-geek or audiophile, you have to hear this system to believe it.

Quick Tip - If you are looking for duck in the valley read on. This is worth checking into.  My parents have been going here for years. Dad is in love with hot n sour soup, and he gets a kung pao chicken (no nuts) all the time. He likes nuts, but apparently not in his kung pao...and they know this. Mom has her fave too, but I can't recall what it is...but I digress.  We had been talking about duck for Christmas for awhile, and I had seen the takeout menu from here at Mom's house. It said they did duck 4 different ways, one of which was Peking duck, carved at the table - for like $23.   Mom called a couple days ahead and said we needed Peking for about 4, and Mary Anne (owner?/server/nice person) said we would need 2 ducks - which is about right. We showed up on Xmas day at 1pm (as scheduled) and 2 Peking ducks were waiting. The non-duck-eaters ordered their entrees and we settled in for duck.   Yep. Carved at the table by MaryAnne's husband (owner and chef I think). Super deftly while he held the duck in a clean towel and shaved it with a cleaver-like blade. Never seen that technique before, but I'd be willing to try it once I buy the knife. :)  Mary Anne expertly folded it into the Chinese pancakes with sauce and Scallions and placed them on the plates. GREAT SERVICE. After she wrapped a couple we told her to just leave the duck on the lazy Susan and forget about the pancakes.   Duck Skin= Pretty darn crisp. Not quite perfect if yer a duck snob, but really good.  Meat= Flavorful, nicely seasoned. Expertly cooked. Bones= they asked if we wanted them. Hell yes! For $23 I wasn't expecting them to do this ultra-traditional and serve in 3 courses! I've got all the fixins and the time tomorrow to crank out some duck soup.   It's a strip-mall gem! The hot tea could be kicked up a notch or 3, but they have TsingTao and a Japanese beer or two. The old-time fave cocktails are also available. The Wor Wanton is very nice, with good amounts of baby corn and a few really pretty snow peas. Its cheaper in the long run than ordering regular wonton (which is 1 person - the Wor is for 2 but really serves about 3-4).   We're going back! They do crispy duck, and Yuling duck, and Szechwan Tea-smoked duck. So there's gonna be some trips, because nobody in our duck party has tried the smoked or Yuling...and they have all made our 2014 list.   They also offer great lunch specials like most Chinese restaurants...so if yer in the area - hit them up for that. If you want to kill a couple hours and munch on Peking Duck; this place is totally worth a visit!

Uh-oh. Hopefully this was an off day that will be corrected. The usual staff wasn't there; our waitress who didn't seem too fluent in English said the owners would be back soon - they were shopping.   Meanwhile - the liquor license isn't current, so no beer/wine/liquor. That is supposed to be worked out in about 2 weeks (but I saw no signs for pending applications/renewals anywhere)  Kung Pao shrimp (lunch special) had 4 shrimp, 1/2 plate rice, and 1/3 plate green bell peppers (no nuts, as ordered).  Hunan Lamb - Sorry, no lamb today.  Mongolian beef: not spicy. Mostly sauteed onions with some beef. Chili oil not hot, so it never did get spicy.   Note my previous review was glowing - so let's hope this corrects itself soon, as my parents live close and they like the owners (who hopefully still own it) and the food they usually get.

Saw it on DDD. Guy steered us wrong here. I had ribs and brisket in order to give them a fair shake. Neither worked for me. Service was way slow on a Saturday around 8pm. Ribs were cold, as was brisket. Brisket was smokeless, as were ribs. Sauce I wouldn't buy even if it was at the dollar store. I won't return. Rather drive to Honey Bear's.

I needed to fax some fragile documents 2 days before Christmas. That meant finding a full-serve copy center where I could copy the docs and fax them. This place was within 2 miles of my location - which only took half an hour to get to, because it's across the street from Arrowhead. Did I mention it's 2 days before Christmas??  Luckily, Debbie was just coming on shift and offered to help me copy and fax. Yes, I can run a copier and a fax machine just fine - but since this was an impromptu errand I was caught without my reading glasses and it was nice to not have to look like an idiot trying to read the instructions on how the payment card thingy works! Plus, Debbie was very friendly and super helpful! She had also just endured the misery of Bell Road at Christmas time, so we could commiserate with one another!   Anyway - 5 stars for Great Customer Service!

The place has been serving burgers and beers since the mid-60's for a reason. It's a Phoenix institution.   Beers run from the like of PBR, to Coors Banquet, to Moose Drool - with a bunch of other offerings to please your palate and your wallet. Mugs, glasses, and pitchers are frosty.  Burgers are super-tasty! (I usually go with mushroom and swiss).  This is an old-skool bar that has a flat-top grill and a deep fryer. It also has the most comfy arm rests you've ever laid your elbows on, lining the bar; so belly up and order a wineburger and a brew.  Note: They close around 10pm most nights - so don't expect to hit this place up for a nightcap.

Employees are knowledgeable, quick and they know where things are. That's 90% of what you need in a hardware store.   They also have those weird specialty items/tools that you'll only use once - but they will save you like 10 hours of frustration. That's the other 10% of what u need in a hardware store.

Place alwyas seems busy - but we never spend too much time here - whether we are buying tires or getting a flat fixed.  I went in the other day with a 2-headed screwdriver sticking out of the sidewall. Even with 3 or 4 other customers ahead of me - we were all out of there in under 30 mins. Discount put a new tire on, with no problems. The road hazard warranty saved us some $$ that day! Totally worth the money upfront.

Tuesday - $10 pizza. 5-toppings, all of which were good. Fresh 'shrooms (not canned), jalapenos that were actually hot (yeah), tons of black olives, sausage and salami. The sauce was a bit sweet - but not cloying.  Went in and picked it up - quick and easy. No problems.

I goto McD's twice a year. Shamrock shake and McRib. This year I added a 3rd trip during the BOGO offer for the new Quarter Pounders.  Drive thru here offers two lanes to order that converge into one for pickup. Drivers beware. Many drivers leaving the DriveThru also U-turn into the parking area on the East side, so it's probably not a great place to park - and you take your life into your hands if you are trying to leave the Wal-mart via that passageway.  We found the new habanero QP to be fairly tasty, with a giant slice of tomato and the sauce was actually decent, with some spice to it. Not hot, but hotter than I expected from McD. I was gonna give them 3 stars for the fact that I was pleasantly sursprised.  Then, I remembered that my previous trip here they didn't have shamrock shakes. They were out. Like 3 days into the limited time promotion. Back to two stars.

I'm a long time fan of Sonic. Just the drink possibilities are awesome. I recommend a Watermelon Limeade (that's a limeade with watermelon flavoring) or a chocolate coke.   U can never go wrong with tots (with or without chili/cheese/onions) - they are way better than any french fry ever concocted! The "new" hot dogs they have here are pretty tasty. I had a Chicago-style dog, and it was piping hot with a snappy casing as you bit into it. I'm not gonna abandon a true Vienna Beef dog joint for them - but it's nice to know they are almost as good! Maybe next time I stop in I'll see if they can do a foot long this way - that would be awesome, although there won't be a poppy seed bun involved, and that's a shame.   Sonic, are you listening?? You could create AND corner a market with footlong ChiDogs - but you gotta have the poppy seed buns!!  Check their add-on list - you can add a lot of things (including green chile and jalapenos) to just about anything, and that is just one more bonus that sets Sonic apart from the rest of fast-food corporate America.  One of my fave things about Sonic is that the carhops rollerskate - alas - even Sonic seems to be slacking off on this. It should be required to have ALL hops on skates. I do give them props for hiring people that can actually count change correctly! It's hard to find a waitress or cashier these days that can subtract $9.91 from $20 in their heads. Sonic is keeping mathematics alive!

I tend to log in online, order a book and pick it here. Its fast and efficient. The self-checkout machines are a breeze to use, and the hold shelf is well-organized.  Good selection of DVDs and CDs. More can be delivered, just place a hold and have them shipped here. Excellent way to catch up on TV series' that you missed out on.  One problem is the fiction section seems to pack in a lot of books by "big" authors. If you like reading what everyone else reads, you'll be well served. If you like searching out new or lesser-known authors - they have them, but often they'll have books 3 and 4 of a series - so you'll have to order 1 and 2 from another library first.  The culture passes go quickly - so line up early if you want one!

If you are looking for an $8 pizza that is READY RIGHT NOW, this is your place. I've never had to wait on a Supreme, even if there is a bunch of people waiting on pizzas. Apparently they often get behind on Pepperonis for $5, and custom orders always seem to have people waiting for them.  This is NOT as good as Sardella's across the street - but it's an $8 pizza ready to go.

Price is the same as going to Cost Cutters during the haircut sale day - so save the $ and go here. Its a well-appointed shop, nicely furnished and they offer all the traditional barber services. No appointments necessary. I'd go back. Conversation is non-existent, but that's okay by me!  Also - the sign on the window says they buy gold...ummm...okay.

Sorry folks - thought I reviewed this place ages ago. My bad.  We don't go here a lot  - we tend to hop around when it comes to pizza joints. But, it's a pretty decent pie! Fresh and tasty. Mondays are 1/2 off your pie...  Eating in the establishment is our preference - even the 4 minute drive to the house will kill any hope of a crispy wing.  As for the wings - they aren't bad. Suicide is hardly suicide, so don't be scared if you like the upper-levels of heat. You'd be hard pressed to tell the diff between Suicide and Hot. Like every place else, the wings are more expensive than I'd like. I'm just not sure wings are a good value anymore...anywhere.  The staff is friendly and fast - inside AND delivery. So however you wanna do it.

Quick update -awhile back Sardella's asked Social Media (facebook if I recall) what toppings we'd like to see added to the choices. Many of us voted for artichoke hearts. Lo and behold, not two weeks later I could order them on my pizza, even online ordering got updated. Nice to see a business that interacts and reacts quickly with their clientele and has a responsive web design/social media team.

#DTCCR SUCKS. I'm only giving it 2 stars, because my GF prefers TB to DT, otherwise it would be ONE STAR.  My personal disdain for this particular one comes from the horrible drive-thru correct completion ratio (#DTCCR). They have gotten our order correct MAYBE 5% of the time, with a statistically significant number of visits. REALLY.  Tonights order 4 items= 2 Taco Salads-minus rice. One Pintos Cheese w/ green not red sauce. Steak Enchirito. 2 Drinks.  Salads came thru window fast, and intact (no rice - yay!). 2 drinks followed, with one straw (boo). Second bag was pulled before coming thru window because it contained a large number of items (car behind us?). Second bag came thru - pintos, check. Enchirito, check.  Got home - pintos with green? Nope. Red. Enchirito steak? Negative Ghost Rider.   6 items+2 straws = 8 things to hand us. 2 of them wrong, and no straw. 5 outta 8 just isn't a good percentage. Bonus points for window girl for realizing she had wrong bag and grabbing 2nd bag "on the fly". Negative points for substituting incorrect items for other incorrect items.   It's just not worth it to call these places back and complain, or drive back, and they know it. I can't stress enough - when at this drive-thru DOUBLE CHECK YOUR ORDER for CORRECT ITEMS - not just number of items.

Crispy fish tacos! Hot salsa that is actually pretty hot. Nice clean salsa bar, nice clean restaurant. Service was a tad slower than on past visits, but everything was fresh, clean and crisp.   I highly recommend the new avocado corn tacos! Ultra tasty.  Also glad they went back to battering their own Original tacos! Sad to see the Mahi Mahi go away, but it got replaced by Ono, so next visit I'll try those, grilled AND blackened - cuz that's how I used to enjoy the Mahi.   Things I can complain about on this visit are:  People need to learn to ROLL limes before slicing them...otherwise, getting the juice outta them is pretty unlikely without using the death grip that always ends with the juice right in yer eye! Prices have gone up a bit...I understand fuel costs and all that but three bucks a taco is getting pricey. However, I'd rather the prices stay as high as they are rather than have freshness and quality suffer.

I am livid as I write this. I rarely eat at McD's, but I do stop in for a McRib when it is offered. That was our reason for going this time.   Our order was 1 Mcrib, 1 Qtr Pounder, 1 Big Mac, 1 side salad, 1 drink, 1 fry. Five items and a drink.    When our bags came through the drive thru window, we did a cursory check and had 5 items in the bag in a quick, efficient manner. When we got home - we had 1 Qtr Pounder, 2 Big Macs, 1 fry, 1 salad and drink. Yeah, it is five items + drink. Not the CORRECT five items.   I drove back with 2 big macs, receipt and bagging list (both of which listed mcrib and 1 big mac). I went inside and spoke with the employee there. I said I would like to return the 2 big macs in exchange for a new big mac and a mcrib. He turned around and had the cook make a new mcrib, which he promptly handed to me and said I could keep the other 2 big macs.   WTF? How much more plain can I make it? I want a FRESH big mac AND a mcrib, not TWO bigmacs that are now half an hour old (they will be by the time I drive back home).   I didn't even bother to argue the point. Why? The store is equipped with thousands upon thousands of dollars in equipment designed to take orders, cook orders, and track orders. The whole process happens in an area 500 square feet. But somehow, even with all of this high-tech equipment tracking your order from start to finish; something as simple as getting FIVE items in a bag correctly is beyond the capability of the multiple staff members that is preparing/checking and serving that order in those 500 square feet.   I came home -  and ate a bit of my mcrib. I didn't eat the big macs as they were cold, and who wants to reheat burgers laden with lettuce and special sauce? That's just gross. It could have been a nice treat, but instead I had to log onto the internet and spend what could have been dinner time letting you all know that things like caveat emptor still apply, especially at drive thru windows. Cursory item counts aren't enough.. you have to VERIFY what each item is. I'm paying good money for simple items which are tracked by complex systems and multiple personnel yet somehow such a seemingly simple task can go wrong in the matter of a few feet. I just don't get it. Thanks for nothing, McDonald's.

I've never had a problem at this Wendy's. It is one of the few drive-thrus that don't screw up the order.   Food is always fresh and hot. Those pretzel-bun bacon burgers are mighty tasty, in case you were wondering.

Another trip that didn't go right at the drive-thru. Between bad audio adjustment on the speaker and the fact that the person operating the drive-thru obviously didn't speak English as a first language led to a wrong order. They were also out of Jalapeno Rings - how does that happen? Management might want to step up there game at this location.

Apparently they have now discontinued the jalapeno rings and now have jalapeno poppers - which are not stuffed peppers. They are cheddar-cheesy stuffing with chopped up peppers in them. Not bad...but not the rings. Bring back the rings!  But they still have Inferno sauce...and the occasional shrimp tacos are good.

Everyone here is yelping about the deli stuff. Okay, it's a deli and bakery - I get it. BUT what you gotta come here for is San Marzano tomatoes. Not those SM-like/style tomatoes that are actually grown in USA (yes they have those too) but the real deal, grown near the base of Mt. Vesuvius. Look for the DOP stamp (its like a region-control stamp on French wines).  Oh yeah, pick up some imported pasta in shapes you've never seen or some pizza dough and fresh basil (it's in the deli case by the meats) and make your own sauce. BAM!  Don't forget the Torrone (nougat candy) or some Italian Ice/Spumoni for dessert if you aren't a big pastry fan.

I don't go often, but sometimes I feel the Sirens' call to build my own salad whilst walking along a sneeze guard. This place has a good selection of fixin's for salads and the plates are a nice temp for them. Not always super-chilly, but usually not hot outta the dishwasher.  Of course, you can grab a soup or two and split open a nice baked potato to be topped with broccoli and cheese, or taco meat and cheese, or whatever you like. I lean towards the taco/salsa combos for the taters.  Place is clean, in a converted, architecturally interesting and storied building. The mall it sits outside of is another story altogether...   Price is right, especially if you use a coupon.

OMG. Another chain-restaurant review? Yep.  I don't always feel like driving 50+ miles for a meal...so when the GF showed up 30 minutes late from work due to traffic...I thought a little treat would be nice...so off to "The Metrocenter" for some seafood!  First off, I gotta give 'em kudos for a few things:  They have a clean lobster tanks separated into 3 size categories. Pick yer lobster, if you like. (Kids love this) The place is clean and inviting. The staff is efficient. Waiting areas are abundant and comfortable - should be no problem unless they are getting hammered with walk-ins that day.  Yeah, it's a chain. A chain that offers seafood and LIVE MAINE LOBSTER FROM THE TANK in the MIDDLE OF THE DESERT. Whatcha want? 1-1/4pounder or a 3 pounder? They have it. Go look at it cruising around the tank before you order it!  Anyway - we went for Lobsterfest - we covered the bases. Calimari, fried shrimp, sauteed shrimp, scampi, crab legs (Snow - not King), shrimp stuffing, crab stuffing, and 3 Maine tails plus cocktails and beer between us - all for less than a hundred bucks. Try to do that anywhere else in the Valley.  Service was fast, polite and effective. The ambiance was nice, and the air temp was very comfy; since the days are 85 and nights are 55 right now - they did a good job picking an inside temp.  NONE of the food (including the calamari) was overcooked, or rubbery. That's saying a lot when you look at what we ordered.   Couldn't think of a better way to spend a Thursday dinner without driving a zillion miles. We'll be back.

It's all been said before, but I'll give it my shot. But first: Get this straight: I was drug down here against my will. I had no desire to wait 2+ hours for ANY pizza, never mind one that's served with a side of attitude (that was what I expected after reading all the reviews).  Here's what I learned.   The place next door (also owned by the Bianco's) has a good selection of wine, beer, bottled waters and soda. None of the "Big 3" breweries either, to my relief. Nice micro stuff. It's small. It's much cooler than standing outside. It's easy to spend a bunch of money while you wait for the restaurant to call over and let you know your table is ready. Note that you still have to stand in line initially to get "on the list" for Pizza seating, but you can send someone in to get beverages and tables while someone stands in line next door.  Pizzeria itself is small (obvious from the other reviews n'est pas?). Our wait staff was quick and friendly - no troubles with the hostess either.   Food is awesome, although I don't think the mozzarella is "all that" like some would have you believe. After all -fresh mozzarella is pretty easy to make yourself. Google it, if you don't believe me.   Anyway, we all 4 had different pizzas. I went Margherita with garlic because I didn't want my thin crust all weighed down with stuff - I wanted to see what the place really had as far as sauce and crust, so that's really the best way to go. Others loaded up. All were extremely satisifed.   Was it worth 2 hours and $150+ between pizza, apps and drinks? That's a hard call, and the reason I gave this 4 stars...which I really wanted to be 3.75 but Yelp doesn't do fractions. Now, to check out Grimaldi's and see if their simulated NY water machine makes any difference to AZ water and its inclusion in a dough.

I'm poking around Yelp today and figured I better update my review on this place. Turns out, I never did one. Oops. My bad.  I was going to update it since nobody seems to be mentioning the fact that they have downsized a bit. The liquor store side no longer has all the rows of wine and beer. The little walk-in cooler for all the high end wines/champagnes is gone too.  Don't fret too much, they seem to have it all under control. The selection is still top notch, and it is easier to make a selection now that you can't wander around aimlessly for an hour amongst the warm shelves. Everything is chilled now. That's a bonus for me because I'm a #craftbeer geek and I like to know that the purveyors of fine Abbey Ales are doing the monks justice and treating their product with the respect it deserves.   The cigar selection is good, and the humi is well-built, well-maintained and well stocked.   The bar side is an awesome place to lounge around in comfort, drink some small batch bourbon and smoke without having to go face blistering heat outside. If bourbon isn't your thing they have plenty of single malts and tequilas.   Beer selection is good, with way more Belgians than you and your friends want to try to plow your way through in one night. I didn't look for any sours, so can't speak for that - as they just don't seem to sound conducive to cigar enjoyment.

My parents have bought many appliances from them over the years. They always get a good deal, even when shopping for budget items rather than state-of-the-art.  Yesterday I took my mom in to get a fridge, as hers had conked out. Ed had spoken to her on the phone when she was price shopping - and showed her the fridge they had spoken about. We had just looked at the same fridge at Home Depot, for about $5 more than here. The difference was HD had $0 delivery charge, but couldn't get it to her until at least Thursday. $30 Delivery from Spencer's, but its in her kitchen now.   Spencer's FTW.

Like Amanda G., we live closer to 19/Bell but prefer to go here.  The produce is either awesome, or in a bad way...so you can't always get all of your shopping done. Sometimes u have to shop for produce elsewhere - but sometimes it is spectacular. Not sure why its so hit or miss.  Bonus points for the auto shop staying late as we drove over in a panic with a tire hissing badly. They checked it out, turned out to be a screwdriver in the sidewall. Unfortunately, it also turned out the tires on the rear weren't from Walmart. Oops, our bad. They still took the time as they closed up to swap it out for the donut in the trunk! I got the tire replaced the next day at the store we had bought them from.  I may have to take the screwdriver back to this walmart to show the guys, as I know they were curious as to how it got in there (the philips-head end was sticking OUT of the tire....turns out it was a double-sided driver, went in the tread, came out the sidewall)

If you've never shopped Sunflower before, you are in for a treat. It is very much like a Sprouts Market, but with a few different products.   The produce is usually high-quality, although as some have mentioned there is an occasional fruit fly outbreak. That happens with fresh, ripe fruit. Get over it. They get the problem under control quickly - it's not a huge deal.  The bulk section is newly remodeled with cool press-to-dispense containers. Cool. They have a LOT of cool things here, including Semolina flour and Forbidden Rice. Wasabi peas too!  Boar's Head Deli. 'Nuff said.  Craft beer selection is nice, with quite a few local beers (although they never seem to have anything from Old World Brewery, dammit!) Wine selection is excellent if you are bargain shopping and they do carry a few mid-higher grade wines. No Top Shelf stuff is available...it's not that kinda store, people. You can get decent value wines much like you would at Trader Joe's, with a good selection of countries available and they often have an impressive selection of organic/biodynamic wines if that's your thing. We like to buy a brand called "Herding Cats" as they have a nice merlot/pinotage (?If I recall) blend that we like with pasta - which is also a good deal at Sunflower.   Pasta selection varies by what they can get I think. Usually, they have something domestic and something Italian. Check the labels - if it is "imported" I have found that occasionally it is from Mexico. Don't get that crap. I just don't think that region grows very good Durum Semolina, so the pasta doesn't cook "quite right". (Trust me - I'm Italian, I cook a lot of pasta..) Which leads me to Olive Oil...great selection here, especially if you want to buy a gallon. Again, CHECK THE LABELS. We LOVE a brand called GENCO (yes like the famous...oh never mind..) that is a blend of EVOOs from different countries. BUT PAY ATTENTION...don't get the Genco BLENDED (Blended is in different font on the front of the container - the ingredients list tells you it is canola and EVOO.  Sausage - good stuff here. The chicken varieties are kinda plain as you would imagine chicken sausage is - but the pork varieties are all pretty good and they sell them at $2/lb quite often. Deal.  Veal/buffalo - yep. Usually in the freezer section.   Amy's? Check.   Yogurts/dairy - nice, organic selection but if I REALLY need great cream for something I head to Trader Joe's...always. Most butterfat of any cream I have found available to the public. They have good eggs too. Local and organic/free-range...look around and they might be doing a blowout special on them. Those are awesome as they are almost "expired " and PERFECT for deviling as they peel nicely.  Cashiers are friendly and knowledgeable.   This place has the BEST reusable burlap bags that sit flat with awesome heavy-stitched handles with some kinda waterproof(?) liner. Other stores always comment how cool they are...   Vitamins/herbs/fresh spices - yeah they have all that stuff. You can buy fresh nutmeg and grind it way cheaper than you can buy bottled stuff at the supermarket, so why not?

Tiny. A deli case and a meat case. Both filled with quality products. Staff is quick, on-the-ball and friendly. Come with an idea, not a plan. Buy what looks best, or what you can afford.   It's not cheap - quality never is.   There are a few dry good items like pasta - but if you are looking for that kind of stuff, head to Romanelli's...don't come here. Come here for the meat. They specialize in corn-fed Iowa beef. If you are looking for grass-fed...I don't think these are the droids you are looking for, but they might be able to order it?   What I DO know: is that the ribeye I had from here yesterday was AWESOME (so well marbled). Melted in my mouth. The hot dogs and sausages looked mighty tasty - but that's for another day...

What do you do when its 125 degrees outside and you need to do some grocery shopping? Head here!  This store is installing a lot of covered spaces in the parking lot, so that will be a huge plus to shopping here come summer time! Nice move, Albertsons!  Good meat, great bacon at the counter, good produce...no stupid reward cards to keep track of...

I used to HATE this particular store. I stopped in the other night for some cupcake papers and was amazed at the remodel. I didn't spend much time, but I can tell you it looks pretty nice, very clean and if you need some cupcake/icing products they have a very nice selection.   I did hear a couple people complaining while I was there that the whole store was re-arranged, but it seemed to be layed out more to my liking than it used to be. I'll go back and check it out in-depth!

As far as the sandwiches go, the place is fine but just thought I'd mention that if you are trying the broccoli-cheddar soup late in the day you may find it "overcooked tasting" bordering on acrid and burnt like we did.  I guess they assume everyone is going to order a $5 footlong because pricing for six-inchers is not quickly established by looking at the overhead menu.  Meatball Sub Note: $2 six-inchers and $4 footlongs seem to be offered here all the time.

They always seem to have a deal on meatball subs (1.99 6 inch), and the employees really make the subs look nice. We come here once in awhile and are never disappointed.  Note - that "sweet onion sauce" or whatever it is - will probably be fine on a 6". It gets a bit cloying after awhile. You've been warned.

I don't go here often - but I'm going to start going more! Came because they were having a sale on Copper River Salmon (It is in season right now) for only 9.99/lb. Everywhere else wanted $16-29/lb. I called around to a number of stores and this was the only place that seemed to have a meat department that not only immediately knew what it was, but also knew they had it, how much they had, and what it cost without going to look. (kudos to Jose in the dept for that). Jose also asked my name, and what time I'd be in - he said he would be off when I got there, but that he would let Justin know. He did. Justin knew right away that I had called and had some nice whole-side filets all laid out in the case. We bought 2.  The rest of the store was clean and nicely laid out. Well lit. Staff was attentive and polite, without being "in your face" trying to help you find something.  BIG BONUS - Beer section. Main aisle is separated into Domestics, Imports, and Crafts - all labeled under nice big signs and arranged well. At the end of that aisle, around the corner in a refrigerated end cap is LOCAL CRAFT BEERS. If you are looking to pick up some Grand Canyon, Mudshark, or Old World brews (plus all the other locals it seemed) - look no further.

With 126 other reviews, there's not much to add. I did want to mention that in addition to great food, the staff is like a well-oiled machine.   Arriving just before shift change on a Saturday meant that there were literally a dozen girls on the floor. Servers, bussers, and hostesses. None, not one, of them stood around idle or glanced at a cell phone/PDA. They were a whirlwind of efficiency. Wiping tables, one would move a table - another would sweep under it, while yet another would "turn it" with new condiments/napkins/hot suaces, et al.   Same goes for the guys behind the line. A flurry of activity to crank out dish after dish. Awesome job! Awesome.  I did ask for a takeout menu, but they don't have any - which is why none exist on the web, I guess. And, I did not snap a photo of the 4-pager myself. Sorry. We did grab a couple of food shots though - check those out.

This place never disappoints. We branched out, but stayed with the mini-ceviche tostadas (can't miss those) for apps. Can't remember what the GF had (some torta - which is unlike her) and I had the pork belly street tacos. In addition to the Valentina's sauce on the table, there was some other one made with chiltepin peppers. EXCELLENT and actually non-gringoized.   I'll admit, I didn't finish the 3rd pork belly taco. It just wasn't crisp enough for me (the meat not the shell), but it was tender. The texture just wasn't suiting me at that moment in time. I think the contrast of the crispness and citrusy flavors of the ceviche was just too much for me to take in on that day. Sometimes you like black and white, other times, you want muted pastels, ya know what I mean? I'm pretty sure it wasn't their fault - so my song remains the same 5 stars.   This place rocks. Staff is fantastic, food is good, and I was intro'ed to a new bottled hot sauce...which I don't remember the name of but theres a pic of it on GF's phone. I'll add it later.  P.s. As many ppl have noted, the tortas are a bit on the large side. They offer mini versions of most (if not all). That's the way to go if you order apps or just aren't into eating a pound of meat..

I went here specifically to see Avatar in RealD (theatre 4). I may return to see it in IMAX Digital 3D, just out of curiosity.   Theatres are nice. Auditorium 4 is a bit small  (seats 169 screen estimated to be 43' Wide *31' H by counting ceiling tiles) if you are watching Avatar (which is why I will goto AZ Mills IMAX to compare visuals). Concessions are cool - you can grab yer own candies and pay for them at usual way-too-high theater pricing - but concession staff at least points out that if one person is ordering an ICEE and popcorn that they do have a two-ICEE deal that includes free popcorn (which wasn't that great, but I could put on my own butter flavoring NOT REAL BUTTER). I also noticed by the butter flavor dispenser they have single-serve jalapenos in little cups you could grab if u had a hot dog or nachos...very cool.  Place is clean, and new. Ticketing via online purchase and picking up at kiosk is ultra-smooth. Save the service charge by joining movieWatcher club.  Screen could be bigger (I say that about most theatres) and sound is not THX certified, nor were there any Dolby, SDDS, or DTS logos that highlighted its capabilites before the show. The movie itself, which sported both Dolby and DTS logos (can't remember if there was a SDDS logo) in the credits and was mastered at Skywalker Sound was not overly impressive in the audio department. Standard digital surround. Whatever...  Real D is an impressive format using what I am guessing was a single Sony projector. 2k? 4k? Not sure. Some parts could have been a tad brighter, but the blacks were awesome. Some of the oranges were a tad blown out, but that could have been by design.  I'll definitely hit this up again when I want to see something in RealD. Film was clean, no visual artifacts, no dust.   IMAX here seemed a tad too small for my IMAX tastes when I peeked in the theatre - but I expected that. Theatre staff told me that while the IMAX is currently 2K digital - they are going to 4K soon. I'll check it out then vs IMAX AZ Mills (film).

The Codfather is another great strip-mall find! This one is on 16th St. &  Bell.  It's an interesting style of joint. Seems to be part take-out, part sit-in, part pub, part mini-grocery. You can run in and get some fish n' chips to go, or sit down and have them bring your order to you on real plates, with your ale in real pint glasses (16oz not imperial pints). There's even some gaming in an adjoining area. Billiards, anyone? [More...]  The cod was excellent. Heavy fillets battered up and fried crisp.  A little bit greasy, but I suppose if it was wrapped up in newsprint - it would be perfect. Fries are large and fresh. A little on the limp sde, but they sure beat the stuff fast food joints call fries. They even make sure to give you thescrap batter chips along with the fries and fish. That's the best part of "chips" in my opinion. Of course malt vinegar is on the tables - you have to walk to get ketchup if you choose to do that to your fries.  Too bad we were both in the mood for cod, because we didn't bother to explore the menu, which is pretty much typical English fare. Bangers n' mash (or squeak), sausage rolls, scotch eggs, shepherd's pie...and they offer daily specials of different fish, shrimp, scallops and other goodies. They have happy hour too 3-6p  if you want to toss back a few pints of their awesome selection of import beers on draught or in bottle!  Even though it was almost closing time on a Sunday - the staff was congenial and helpful. Because it was almost closing time we didn't bother to really check out the game room nor the selection of British foods, candies and trinkets available behind the bar. We will save that for our next trip...which will be soon.  4 Stars.

Been back several times. Still great. Exploring "English fare" is tricky. Some of it is definitely an acquired taste, I'm sure. But Fish n chips are always good. Staff always friendly.   They have Aero Bars. That alone is worth the trip if u ask me.

They no longer carry Guinness Draught. It has been replaced with Murphy's Irish Stout ($3/pint by the way). If ordering on the restaurant side, the cashiers are always underage, so they can never advise you on specialty beers available. Not a huge deal - but if you are stopping in for a pint, it's probably easier to sit on the bar side.   I also wish this place offered table service rather than ordering at the counter. Again, another reason to sit at the bar, I suppose.  Fish n chips still good!

It was raining, so we opted for drive-thru, so can't comment on the inside. Service was quick and friendly, everything made it into the bag! That's a big plus...cuz u know they **** u at the Drive-thru (to quote Leo G).  Burgers were good (we opted for the bacon cheddar ones). Buns got a little sloppy near the end due to the liberal use of mayo, but the lettuce was shredded, offering traction for the tomato (bland - but its winter, ya know?). The bacon coulda been crisper, and thicker, and peppered - but that's just how I like bacon.  Crinkle cut fries were crisp and hot (burger was hot when we got home too - plus there). Mashed potatoes were chunky with a decent chicken-flavored creamy gravy. The mashed was a nice alternative to fries...I'm not a big fry person.  We didn't try the frozen custard, unless u count the root beer float or the chocolate malted. Both were good, and ya gotta love a decent malted.  The burgers do have a taste resemblance to In-n-out so I see why so many people make that correlation. But, they seem bigger than a double-double if memory serves correctly.  I'll go back. Its not on my list of "to-die-fors", but its better than a lot of burger places if you don't mind spending a few more bucks on your fast food, or you want some alternate sides. Check em out online and see the entire selection - it may be what you are craving!

My original review still sticks.   We went inside this time. Burgers still good, juicy and delish. Got mine topped with mushrooms and swiss. Added some cheese curds to the side - which may have been a mistake. Not that they were bad - but 2 patties w/cheese, curds and a malted are plenty o' calories and fat for me in one sitting.   If yer lookin for a juicy burger and a malt - check it out.

OK, I'll admit. The digital projectors here are pretty sweet. It is pretty much like watching a Blu-ray movie on an HD projector  only really big. It is different than film, to be sure. The blacks could use a bit more depth, judging from what I saw during Nightmare on Elm 2010. But, there was no "dithering" or "banding" of the whites-to grays or black-to-grays so common to digital sources via Cable TV or a not-perfectly-mastered DVD. That's where digital really fails for me. In the compression. None of that here.   The theatre is very clean, beautiful and the staff is super nice. The chairs are designed by Dan Harkins' wife, a chiropractor, so they are tall, and rock, and lean pretty far back. Comfy. Good leg room, too. Lots of of places to park a wheelchair, if you need to - and its a well-appointed space for that kind of thing. Kudos there.   Sound system is Dolby Digital, with plenty of speakers and excellent imaging. No distortion present, and dialog is crisp and clear. Unlike a THX theatre (are there any left?) the surround effects are definitely localized, and things panned really hard can be perfectly tracked from front to back. Whether you like that will probably depend on your own taste, and what you are watching. For Elm St. it was cool in parts - but distracting enough that the soundtrack lost some of its creepiness factor. You shouldn't always know exactly where a creepy sound is in space. Perhaps a bit more work from the sound mixers in the movie would have helped.  Snacks are expensive, but diverse. U can get a White Castle Burger for $4, if I recall. Drinks are only 99 cents if you bring your Harkins Cup.   Will nice digital theatres like this kill film theatres? I hope not. I keep hoping Harkins digs out their old 70mm projector and rolls it into the Cine Capri for special events - but that probably won't happen.   If you are in the North Valley and want pristine sound and visuals - check this place out. If you NEED to see film grain - this is not your place.  Oh - yeah - you don't want to be here on a weekend night unless you want to deal with all the teens. This seems to be their new place to hang. ________________Original Info Below_____________ This is an FYI to all the people wondering about 3D Movies such as Avatar, and all the different formats out there.  I have not been to this theatre, but I did call them today regarding Avatar 3D, as it was listed as Digital 3D. It is digital projection. 3D format is Image Master. It is NOT IMAX, NOT REAL-D, NOT Dolby 3D. It is a cost-effective system designed to retrofit any projector into a 3D system in a manner similar to the way Real-D does it, but without having to have vendor specific projection equipment.  I can't attest to the quality of the system, as I have not seen it - this is just FYI.

Okay, I'm a bit torn on how to rate this one. I like a lot of it, and dislike a bit of it.  They have a decent wine selection, but I'm a fan of Rhones & Châteauneuf-du-Pape's...and the selection here lacks in that department. To be fair, the selection in a lot of places lacks in that department. The owners are super-friendly and the place is super clean! The cheese selection offers quite a few artisanals that are pretty hard to come by, along with a good selection of other cheeses you are familiar with. The deli meats are great, and the sandwiches are HUGE. Think about sharing them. For sure. Beer selection is good, and they have even ordered some hard-to-find stuff for us. I won't tell you what it is, because then it may not be there when I get back! My only problem with the place is size. They really need to double the space, just so there is some breathing room between tables. The tables need to be bigger too.  It's really hard to enjoy the nuances of a wine and great food when its all precariously scrunched together on a bar-height two-top that's serving duty as a four-top. A cigar-friendly patio would be awesome, also. If you were lucky enough to stop by when they first opened, you might have scored one of the few wine lockers they have. But, unless someone moves out of the area - I don't think you'll get that chance. I'd bet there is a waiting list. Luckily, my buddy scored the biggest one they have - so between his house, my house and the locker we usually have a few choices when we want to do some tasting on our own turf. So there you have it - a nice little place with wine, cheese and beer staffed by some great owners. Stop by and say hi to them. If and when Bob D. decides to pull his photos out of there, I think I will see if I can put mine in there. :) In the meantime - get down there today and buy some bubbles for tomorrow. They had a great selection last year. Happy New Year.

This is a review of the LIEMAX (IMAX) screen here. It is small, maybe a foot or two bigger than any other theatre here, but not the gigantic IMAX screen you are thinking of.  To paraphrase Obi-Wan, "This is not the IMAX you are looking for...move along" The screen you are looking for is at AZ Mills in Tempe.  The audio is good...screen is disappointing for what used to be an awesome brand, IMAX. Other than screen size - the projection is awesome (it is actually IMAX film, not the digital thing) so, if you NEED to see something like Beowulf or Avatar in 3D IMAX and can't drive to Tempe (or Westgate for a Real-D presentation), this is your only hope. And it's pretty good. It's just not Old-school IMAX awesomeness.  Parking for this theatre SUCKS BIG TIME. Weekends have plenty of cops and security hanging around, if that tells you anything. But, they do have valet...right in front of the box office. I don't know what it costs.  There are teeny boppers galore. If you are 16 and looking to hang with some "cool" kids, this is probably your best bet in the area on a Saturday evening ...if you are an adult trying to enjoy some time off from your kids - head elsewhere.

I just can't get behind this theater. Check my previous 1-star review on the Imax (LieMax) they have here. But I came back to see a regular movie. Unfortunately, even though the Sony 4k digital projectors are crisp and bright - the sound isolation from adjoining screens is non-existent. You hear every gunshot/explosion/helicopter from the movie next door.   The acoustics in this place would never pass a THX audit. (Some of you old-schoolers know what that means).  So, 1 star for the Imax - and the same star for the lack of insulation. The theatre is clean, but the chairs don't rock - so no stars there. I'll throw in  an extra star for the Sony 4k.

Trash was overflowing! Literally. The dining room had one couple in it, and unless a busload full of people left moments before we walked in, I can't think of any valid excuse that the trash was overflowing, the tables weren't wiped and there was trash all over the floor.   The only reason I'm giving two stars is - the chicken was great (we took our order home), the order was right and everything was hot. We got an extra spork in our order (bonus) so I'm not gonna hold the fact that there was no honey packet for the biscuits (its not really honey anyhow, ya know..)  Management - clean up your act.

We went in here on a Sunday afternoon. Nobody was in there, but the place was spotless and inviting. We were there to try their new offering - "Broaster Chicken". We have given up on all "the chicken places" because even "Extra Crispy" never is...so we were hoping for to finally find some that was crisp and flavorful.  We Did! We each got 2 piece dark meat combos, and the chicken was SUPER HOT, FRESH, and TASTY. Crispy? Oh yeah! Nicely seasoned, too.  We tried the cole slaw, potato wedges and macaroni salad - because many times sides like these just aren't worth the time...but all were good. The potato wedges were nice and crispy, I think they too are broasted. The mac salad seemed to be made with real mayo - as it didn't have that lame-ass, sweet Miracle whip tang that so many places favor. It could have used a dash of mustard or hot sauce - but that's my personal preference. Report on the cole slaw was good too (I'm not a fan of most slaws in general).  Another plus - they had a Sam Adams seasonal on tap (Spring Alpine?) which was tasty and came in a nice 25oz frosty mug. Can't go wrong with frosty mugs. They also had some local #craftbeers in bottle (Four Peaks). So that's another plus.  While we were there, about 5 other tables filled up - so we must have just come in at a weird hour for pizza/chicken (3pm Sunday). I also like the fact that they have nice, clean booths. So many places are ditching boot seating these days, in favor of hard-seated chairs (so they can turn the tables quickly?) and that's just a shame. Long Live Booths!  Staff was quick, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. We had no probs at all. Will definitely go back for some more chicken! I'm giving 5 stars because we finally found a place that has chicken worth going out for - oddly enough, its a pizza joint. Whoda thunk it? Prices on chicken also beat those other chicken places.

Dropping these guys a star, because our last 2 visits for the Broaster chicken resulted in chicken that was too salty. We thought maybe it was a fluke - but last visit shows us that maybe its not. Chicken still gets 5 stars for crispiness though!  We'll go back, but maybe we'll branch out from the chicken. The Italian Beef sandwich was nice and tasty (and tender) - although I'm not sure I agree with the idea of a sesame-seed bun for it.

Standard Vienna Beef Chicago dogs, and Italian beef. The dogs are now price-reduced to $1.99 permanently rather than the price on the menu, according to the sign in the window.   Dogs are good, place is nice & clean. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  Onion rings and cheese fries are excellent. Vienna beef dogs. They also have FIRE DOGS, but you wouldn't know it from the menu. I didn't find out until after I ordered. Oh well, definitely next time.  You can also buy an assortment of Vienna beef condiments, that are almost impossible to find except online (the neon relish, sport peppers, etc.)  They have a Chicago classic rock radio station (97.1) playing on the audio system, and a nice, well-adjusted Samsung HDTV flat screen (probably 50") in case there is a game on.

We were hoping to try out Z's deli, in the same plaza - but arrived late and they were closed. This place was open, so we walked in. It was about 20 minutes before closing, and I'm pretty sure the family (seems like a "family run joint") was just about to break down the kitchen and pack it in.   I ordered the gyros plate, Athena went with the kebabs. Beef, to be exact. Our dinners both came with soup or salad. If I recall, there were 3, maybe 4, types of salad and one soup to choose from. We both opted for Greek salads. The owner (I assume he was the owner) took our order and called it out to the cook. Athena conversed with him a bit, putting in an order for some baklava to go, when we left, while I strolled the cheese section of the market.   The owner asked if we would like our salads first, and we said yes. I sat down at one of the nine tables, while Athena perused an aisle or two. In addition to delivering our salads to the table, the owner retrieved silverware and napkins for us from the trays located by the drink machine that I was filling drinks at. The brewed ice tea container had already been drained, or was at least empty, and the owner offered to brew fresh for us! We politely declined the offer and opted for soft drinks. No reason to brew fresh for two people when you are trying to close, but so nice to offer!  The salads were ultra tasty, with a sprinkling of sheep's milk feta atop a crisp green salad with kalamatas, romas, cukes and plenty of sliced pepperoncini (I'm going to say they were Italian, not Greek ). The salads were perfectly dressed and ultra tasty.   Our plates arrived, mine with thick fries cooked in peanut oil, hers with perfectly cooked Basmati rice and a nice yellow color to it. Her kebabs were already removed from the sticks, and all the veggies and steak were charred very nicely. The Tahini sauce was pretty decent.  My Gyros (traditional lamb/beef combo) were cooked very well, with ultra thin slices off the spit. Tzatziki sauce was nice and tangy, I'd guess made with Greek yogurt as opposed to regular yogurt or the sour cream others try to pass off! The fries were a bit on the soft side, but nicely cut and flavorful.  As we ate, the cashier closed down the market station and tidied up. The owner continued to stop by and make sure everything was good. It was! He was very friendly, and seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction.   We assured him we would be back to eat, and to do some shopping, as we had discussed the many types of oils available (you gotta try the avocado oil with lime - along with plenty of other oils available by the silverware). Since they were ready to close, we didn't think now would be the time to peruse the many varieties of dry/canned goods available, or the fresh cheeses. There was an aisle I didn't even go down, so that will be a surprise when we return, which we will.  I give this place kudos, and I think it will fill a niche market for groceries to be sure. It should do well - even with 2 other delis in the plaza. Each seems to cater to a slightly different deli crowd.  Definitely check it out.   Solid 4 stars on food freshness, and quality. Another star for great service and a nice, clean European grocery.

I guess the new owners just didn't live up to the old, as mine and other reviewers mentioned. The business is no longer there. There's an empty restaurant area in the gas station if someone else wants to try to make a go of it. Sad...

Taco/Burrito Days M-W. $1.25 tacos, $2.50 Burros. Choice of red chicken, ground or shredded beef.  No flavor (tacos - tried chicken & shredded beef) at all - hot sauce sucks. Burger King is next door. Hope yer in the mood for a burger.

We were looking for something quick and reasonable after photographing Glendale Glitters lights. Everyone else in Glendale seemed intent on making sure they got to try out La Piazza down the block.   This place looked nice thru the window, and the menu featured a few items with green chiles and one with andouille sausage. Between those things, and the owner coming out and talking to us as we read the menu outside - we thought we'd give it a try.  They had a decent selection of microbrew beers, so we obviously started with those. They also have a small selection of hard liquor, so you could go that route, too.   I ordered a 3 cheese grilled cheese sandwich with green chiles, and a cup of Cajun Mac 'n' Cheese. Both were excellent. Athena ordered the Cardinal Burger which is basically a bacon cheeseburger with a vinaigrette on it. The sauce and apple wood smoked bacon were awesome according to her. She had a cup of green chile mac 'n' cheese.  We thought the peppers could have definitely been hotter, but that's true just about everywhere nowadays - everything is dumbed down for us gringos, I guess. The macs tasted good, but got a bit too cold before we finished them. They did arrive hot, we just dilly dallied around too long I suppose.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant. The decor is very nice with modern lighting fixtures, tin ceilings painted a greyish blue and large LCD televisions that are viewable and crisp from almost any angle. Deep blacks, true neutrals, and vibrant primary colors. Good for sports, or movies!  Price is definitely reasonable. We'll be back. I'd give this place 4.25 stars if I could. Sure beats waiting in line for over an hour to try a pizza!

Okay, let's get this straight...there are pros and cons here.  Pro: I think they have more soda than Rocket Fizz. It's all refrigerated and ready to drink! Pro: They have a Santa Fe Burger which involves a battered, deep-fried green chili which is utter genius. I repeat, Utter Genius. Pro: The burgers are well-crafted with attention to detail and carefully laid out, not assembled by an uncaring worker and squished into a wrapper quickly. Pro: They have Pepsi products on fountain in case for some reason ~300 types of bottled soda (most made with Real Cane Sugar OH YEAH) just doesn't do it for you and you need to blend your own suicide-soda. Pro: They will make any soda you want into a float, using soft-serve, for a buck! Pro: Locally-owned by a guy who seems pretty nice and genuinely interested in his customers and their thoughts. That's a HUGE PLUS, people...pay attention!  Pro: The burgers' pickles are good! they don't taste like run-of-the-mill, cheap, food purveyor 5 gallon bucket pickles. Pro: They have a website that seems to be pretty current, it alerted me to the fact that they have some of the last remaining Dublin Dr. Pepper in the world and I should buy now. (Disclosure: While I like Dr. Pepper - I'm not a superfan, and have never tried it - so I figured the $15/6packs were better left to the superfans and collectors). Pro: The building seems to be laid out in an "L" fashion, with the soda selection and main tables on one side; and an 'extra" area of seating on the other side of the kitchen that seems to have a pass-thru ordering window. That probably comes in pretty handy during lunch rush when the kids from the hi-skool next door probably mob the place. We didn't notice this until we were leaving...so I'll have to explore that next time.  Con: The signs telling you about the $1 float options are too high to notice until you've already ordered. Perhaps this is another stroke of genius to encourage repeat business, perhaps its an oversight. Con: It's an older property, so it doesn't have that super-clean feeling about it. It's not dirty by any means...but it's at that stage of life where its not sterile, but not quite yet charming. Of course, this whole part of town is at that stage - so you can't really hold that against the place. Con: Soft-serve rather than real ice cream.  It's not that I hate soft-serve, I give it its credit...but I prefer real ice cream. (Disclosure: if they used real ice cream, I'd probably bitch about that too, because I'm kind of a dairy snob). Con: Shoestring potatoes. I know they have the skin on, and are natural-cut, and shoestrings have millions of loyal followers...I'm not one of them. Give me a tater-tot any day.  Other things of note: My single burger was BIG. You can also go double or Rocket Burger, which is 3 patties on a sub roll. I can't imagine eating that - but I'm sure its a fave amongst many!  Bottom line: Pros obviously outweigh cons and the fact that it is a family-owned/run business always weights positive in my book! We'll be back.

If it wasn't for yelping by neighborhood, we never woulda found this place. We cheated and checked their website first, which informed us that they feature their family-farm pork from Nebraska, so we went in knowing to order pork, rather than beef. That obviously meant pulled pork and brats (they apparently feature a different flavored brat each day).  So, after a bit of driving around the industrial park (We turned in a tad too early, so toured the park) we found it and grabbed one of the few spots marked as theirs on the curb.   Athena ordered the pulled pork sammie with mac/cheese and potato salad. I went beans and potato salad along with my brat - "Sorry, we're out". PANIC set in, I hadn't actually studied the menu...so what did I do? Yep. Same thing everyone does when they panic at a BBQ place...went brisket.   Brisket is nice and tender but it in no way matches the quality, juiciness and flavor of the pulled pork. We tried two sauces - hands down winner? Zippy Mustard, which I tend to think of as a Carolina 'Cue kinda thing and seem to lean that way in my sauce tastings these days.   The beans are good, and well-flavored but I still stick by Honey Bear's as having the best beans (Cow-Bro beans) of all the BBQ joints around.   I do say though, if Im gonna go pulled pork (we split our sammies half and half and shared)I'd head here - not only because its closer but I liked it better (Although I'm partial to the ribs at HB).  The potato salad wasn't to our liking much. Not that it's bad (it features red skinned potatoes) - but I'm pretty partial to "my" kinda potato salad - made with Best Foods mayo and tons o' mustard with no little pickles/relish in it. What can I say? I'm not a Southerner. POAF has the pickles and I'm pretty sure its Miracle Whip..  The tables were clean, and almost all taken by local workers from the surrounding area. They have wetnaps easily available, and they have awesome lever-driven plastic utensil dispensers which are a cool, if kitschy, touch.  Staff is friendly. Place is clean. GO EARLY if you want a brat. They open at 10a and are sold out by 1p...So next time - Im headed b4 lunch rush hits.

Still brewing great stuff! The place is looking better - its come a long way since they moved in!  There are plenty of new brewed offerings. The high-ABV crowd should take note - they've got some good stuff here!  Barrel-aged lovers - keep your eye on this place. Matt has a growing collection of barrels stacking up. He promises more wine and whiskey barrel-aged goodness is coming. The current barrel-aged stuff was tart and tasty while I was there last week...

Drinks are on the high side. I guess they figure they are close enough to Scottsdale to get away with that.  Nobody in our group of 8 had any rave reviews on any of the food - I didn't eat any of it, so can't say.  It's louder than it needs to be - and I worked in the concert industry for a long time - so trust me on that front.  The waitstaff and bartenders are all on the adorable-to-hot scale, and our waitress was very efficient; so there's that going for them, but I won't be headed back anytime soon.

Took our adopted stray in for spaying, using a voucher from the county. It was good for spaying/rabies shot.  Thought it was her first trip to a vet and that she was about a year old.  They called an hour later. They had gotten her sedated and shaved - and found a spay surgery scar - along with some mouth infections that were more serious than we had thought.  I went and picked her up, along with some antibiotics. Her mouth is better, and we sleep better knowing she has her shots (we got the 3-in-1 also) and is spayed (And already had been - she's a long hair so we didn't know!)  The people there were great. I'd give them 5 stars, but they don't have the equip on -site to verify previous surgeries like an x-ray or ultrasound, which seems like it would be beneficial - so if someone wants to donate some equipment, they'd probably appreciate it!

We hit this place around 2pm on a Saturday. Sat on the "saloon side" (which we think should have some swinging doors separating it from the restaurant side to lend an air of authenticity).  Oddly enough, this place has happy hour 7 days a week. So, we decided to order a selection of things from the HH menu. Sliders, taquitos (wrapped in a "pastry dough"? not a corn tortilla), poppers (which are cream cheese filled AND wrapped in bacon), wings (smoked then sauced), and street tacos (again, not a corn tortilla). We covered all the bases; brisket (sliders), pork (various) and links (also sliders). Have to say - everything had a nice smoke to it. Good smoke ring, good flavor without being too cloying.   I tend to like my hot suace with a kick, so poured on a bit of Habanero sauce. The sauce wasn't bad at all - but no hint of habanero to be found. Maybe it was labeled wrong.   The "fruity" dipping sauces that some items come with - we weren't impressed with, as neither of us like our BBQ sweet.   The bar staff is attentive, and knowledgeable. Good at orders too. Jen took our entire order, with our modifications and requests - without writing anything down, and got it all right!  Nice job.   Beer selection is good, with plenty of indy and microbrews represented. Many are available as HH offerings. You can even get PBR in a can for a buck if it's that kinda day...  If you are a bourbon drinker, you'll be happy here. Nothing too spectacular, but they have a decent selection of small batch stuff and Jack single barrel stuff (yes I realize Jack is NOT bourbon).   On Sundays, you can get a free breakfast with a beverage ordered. So, might be a great place to catch a race or game on TV (they have some nice falt panels on both sides of the place), sip some mimosas or Mary's and have a bite to eat.   What kinda BBQ is it? Depends. Seems the owner has grown up with a variety of styles - so there's a bit of Carolina, some Texas, some KC...you'll probably find something you like!  Happy Hour grub will run you $4 an item, with beers less than that. If you are looking for some good smoked food, and a nice selection of bevs to wash it down with - definitely hit this place up. You'll find it behind the Jiffy Lube, on the East side of the street.

Our group totaled 5 people, and we arrived in two separate cars.  Parking was easy on a rainy Saturday night, as the place is located in the mini-mall across from Arrowhead Mall.   I surveyed two others here at the house, afterwards - one rated it a 4 star, one rated it 3.2 "because it's freakin' small" and I gave it a 4.5, for a total of 3.9 stars. I'd bet the actual stars went up if I asked the other two, as they thought it was ultra-convenient to be able to walk next door afterwards and have their pick of 31 flavors of ice cream.   So, the place is SMALL. Not much seating inside, with a few two-tops outside (which don't do any good on the few days in Phoenix it does rain). However, the staff immediately drug a 2-top next to a 4-top to accomodate a party of 5, as the tables designed for that were taken. Extra points there, for sure.   Food was great, and they brought us samples of beef/chicken to taste as we decided. We tried quite a few things - although somehow nobody went with the Spam, nor the fish available - which are both valuable menu items and Spam is hard to find - so if you want it, u can get it here, a couple of different ways.   You can get combo meals (2 or more items), mini meals (1 item), or "burger" options on a few thngs. Meals come with rice (somewhat sticky and fluffy), pasta salad which is basically pasta, carrots and mayo (yay! no "salad whip" crap) but could use a bit of spicing up. Oh yeah, they lay the proteins on a bed of steamed (?) cabbage. Nice touch, cooked so its crisp yet tender.   The beef and pork are very good. The chicken I think we all agreed leaned a bit to the too-sweet teriyaki side. Crab rangoons are nicely fried, with a bit of crab and a mild cream cheese. I heard the egg rolls were also tasty, the veggies were minced well so no "stringy" problems,  with a kick of fresh ginger and a nice thin wrapper.   Portions on everything we ordered were large. Everyone had leftovers. So, don't let the price discourage you - and you might consider sharing a combo.  Sweet/sour sauce was sweet with little sour. Teriyaki is, well, teriyaki. The soy sauce was Korean, and a bit on the light side - but I'm kinda set in my ways on soy sauce.   Service, as I eluded to - was awesome. Totally family-run from what I could tell. A lot of Hawaiian patrons surrounded us - so I'd suspect its as authentic as you might get on the mainland, in the middle of the desert.  They also have a selection of Hawaiian-made beverages in cans, which aren't spectacular, but I chose to go that route (no one else did) because I like to support businesses that import specific items! Otherwise, they have Coca-cola products and I prefer Pepsico. #justsayin.  If yer in the mall, or wanna try some bbq that isn't bathed in smoke or one of the well-known styles of sauce, give this a shot, for sure. If you are looking for a kick of spice, bring yer own - because I didn't see any way to kick it up a notch. It's very "commerical and chain-looking" from the outside, but I can assure you it doesn't taste that way. I forgive their choice of mall location and wish them well! We'll go back for sure.  I added a scan of one side of the menu for an idea of what they have! Check it in the photo section!

We discovered this place the day my GF was at the dentist. Yep. Right next door. Swear.  So obviously, after dental work - the logical thing to do is hit up an awesome candy and soda shop, right? That's what we did.   They have everything from Jolt cola to small batch sarsaparillas. Tons o' saltwater taffy and more licorice than you can shake a stick at.  The one thing that they could use more of - barber poles. Not those big giant useless ones, but the little candy sticks. A good barber pole selection is a NECESSITY in a candy shop. I'd say you have to have at least 37 flavors, and unless they were hiding them (I haven't asked the super-friendly-and-knowledgeable staff) they don't.  On the ultra-plus side - my GF asked about something in particular and about a week later they called her (texted?) to let her know they now had them in stock. That was good, because it gave me a reason to go back for more chocolate covered Pop Rocks. Yes, you heard me. Limited Edition Pop Rocks, can't go wrong there!  Hit this place up ASAP.

Not sure where you'd find a better street taco in Phoenix. The al pastor is awesome, as is the fish, and the shrimp. I didn't try the carne asada, but Athena says its great. They were out of chorizo. dammit.   Note: Many other patrons had to study the menu when they were informed of the chorizo outage. Apparently it's a fave and a "go-to" item.  I went with my usual number of 6 street tacos. Athena had 3 with black beans - which were creamy and dee-lish. That's about the right way to do it for us, although others opted for 10 tacos or 2-3 tacos and a burrito.   One lady (seemingly a regular) went directly for some type of tostada. Seems you can't go wrong however you do it. Everyone there went with the Mexican Cokes, except for one guy that had a diet coke. Whatevs.  I didn't ask about the $7 toasted tortilla. Although, as one of the most expensive items on the menu - we were curious. It cant just be a tortilla can it?  Historical note: some of you may recall this place used to be the best place for a great Chicago Dog...Mr. Mort's, until he retired long ago. I miss that place, but this is a great replacement!  Traffic note: the light rail construction makes this place a bit tricky to get into, but not too bad.  Vacation note: If you are reading this between July 2-9th, 2013: it'll be closed for their vacation!

Picked up a bunch of tacos to go, different kinds. Grabbed a couple of tamales, too. Dealt with the jacked up traffic and headed home. When I got home and unpacked everything the food was barely lukewarm (due to traffic - not the restaurant).  Tamales were BIG. Everything was so good we couldn't waste time reheating anything!   Place was packed. Probably due to us Yelpers. ;)

I was going to log on and give them a good review. Order of 6 items was taken promptly and each of the bags handed to me at the DT Window had their contents inspected and read to me in a polite, efficient manner. Fries poking out of the bag were hot and fresh.  The Problem arose when I got home and unpacked 3 burgers, 1 fish and 1 fry. Again with the Drive-thru Curse. Why is it so hard for fast-food employees to count items and put them in a bag? I'm not spending two bucks in gas to go back for fries that cost them 15cents to make (including their labor and overhead).

This place is great. Food was awesome, with plenty of spices and herbs in everything!   Athena wasn't sure she was going to have anything (She's not that fond of Greek food, despite her name. I think her anti-fondness stemss from some lame aversion to lamb...go figure).  So, the guy behind the counter taking the order suggested the #7 2-meat combo for her, which is expertly seasoned ground beef, and nicely marinated, big ol' chicken breast cubes. She ended up totally loving it, and taking some photos because it looked so nice. (I'll update those later on. )  I went with the #12 gyros plate, because I have no aversion to lamb whatsoever. In fact, I seek it out. I took some pix too, but I couldn't figure out how to operate her camphone very well - so not sure those will be upload worthy.  Drinks come in those red plastic glasses, which I've always loved for some reason. The fountain is Coca-Cola products - but I won't dock them for that, because there was at least Orange Fanta, and a high-tech kinda brewed tea thingy.  We got some soup samples "on the house". Lentil, and curried chicken/potato. Both totally awesome.   The place looked fabulous, and was getting better while we were there. They were busy painting an area where apparently a 42"-ish TV had been hanging, so they could replace it with a spanking new 50" LED model. That'll make 3 of those babies in this nicely appointed place. All were tuned to sports networks - so you should be able to catch a game while u eat!  Only drawback - no beer or wine. A nice carafe of a decent house red would really put this place over the top - as far as strip-mall gyro places go. I hope they add this option - and get ahold of one of the local brewers (Old World Brewery? SanTan?) to supply them with some #craftbeers, rather than opt for some draft crud from one of the big 3.

Great loose/bulk section. ONLY PLACE you should buy spices! Where else are you going to get Pink Himalayan Salt for under $2/lb? Yes. a POUND. So put down that jar you are holding at that other store that has 1.5 oz in it and is $5.95; come here instead.  The coffee aisle has not yet been taken over completely by K-cups like other stores. If you still brew by the pot, this is a good place to check out - and you can get the fancy bulk beans way cheaper than that Seattle-based place.  Dairy section has a wide variety of Tillamook products. They make good stuff, look for the special reserve cheddars. Yummmmy.  Bakery section is fresh and delicious, and cheaper than many other stores on many items.  The whole store is great, employees are knowledgeable and responsive (probably because many of them have an ownership stake - yes, it is employee owned!)   If you are new to this store, wear good shoes! Your first times may take awhile until you figure out an efficient shopping route.

Unlike everyone else, I'm not usually here for the deli or the produce, although both are good. I'm here for beer and wine.  The beer selection is very good. They have sixers and twelvers of good craft beers at reasonable prices and they have a nice large selection of bombers if you are looking for something unique (read - usually pricey but delicious). They have locals and imports. I think they may even have Coors light (and similar) if that's your thing.  Wine section should cover whatever you need. There's plenty from Cali and France. Italy and Germany are represented, and of course Australia and Chile are present. great selection of organic wines (Usually) and you can even find some that are sulfite-free if you look.   They don't carry $3Chuck here (that's a different place) - but they usually have something that is that price that is quite drinkable, excellent for cooking with, and is  great to use to feed your homemade wine vinegars!  Bonus: if you are into using your own canvas/hemp/whatever reusable tote bags, the checkers actually know how to use them and pack them well, unlike most supermarkets which just cant grasp that they don't need to put every bag on their little hookie-stand-thingy. before filling it.

My parents needed a brake job (I could hear the tell-tale alert-squeak one day as they left my house). I called around, and this place offered a good deal ($79.95 for fronts with a coupon) and it is close to their house. Spoke with Mike, and made appt. for next day. Went in with Dad, was greeted by Russ, and had inspection done.   Turned out they needed rotors up front. I looked at them myself - and asked Russ what they spec'ed out at. He immediately said they measured .661, and minimum was .669 so they couldn't machine them.  I had already looked up the spec online, and .669 is minimum, so I knew he hadn't pulled the number out of thin air to sell us something we didn't need. That instilled confidence.   They ordered the parts necessary (also needed a couple seals in the rear) and drove us home to wait for them to finish. They came back a couple hours later and picked us up. Car was ready, and brakes seem good. No more squeaking!  Total cost was as quoted, under $200 for both axles + the cost of the rotors, which was reasonable. Can't complain.   Russ was friendly, joking,  and attentive to everyone that stopped in the shop.   No complaints here, but I just can't give 5 stars to ANY automotive service, its just the principle of the matter. :) Let's go with 4.5 stars.

We went a few weeks ago. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't stellar.   The Banh Mi I ordered was pretty bland, and the burger is overpriced. I had to order the banh mi like 3 times and point to it on the menu because the server said he didn't know what it was. Once he read the decription, he said "oh yeah - that's new but its my favorite thing on the menu." Wait, what?  We ordered a beer flight, and they don't have any of those cool trays that hold the glasses, or even printed placemats that describe each beer, yet. Maybe if they ever firm up the beer selection they will. The flight wasn't bad - but it had a couple of guest brews in substituting for their brews that they were out of.  Since this is the closest brewpub to our house, I had growlers with me. I didn't even walk out to the car to get one. I was hoping for a nice rich porter to fill them with - and they didn't have any that day.  Their saving grace was the Abita Purple Haze on tap. I like Abita beers, but out of all the beers in the flight we tried...I went with the Abita. That's not how it should work at a brewery, unless your guest beer is something like a Pliny or a Stone rarity.

12/20/14 Update UH OH - Went by the other day for some food, and the sign is down and there was a ladder in front of the grill. Closed? Remodeling? Dammit! End Update ________________  This is the former Roberto's (As featured on DDD), inside the gas station. I'm glad to report that the place is back to having awesome food.  If you're tired of watery re-fried beans and flavorless rice - those days are over. These sides rock here! Taste-E. The chimis are huge, and of course you can get them enchilada style, with guac on top if u so desire. The Al Pastor (El Pastor here) is packed with flavor.  There's a chunky pico de gallo with avocado on the chip/salsa bar - you won't want to miss that if you like your pico packed with a decent amount of heat and a crisp citrus bite. The red sauce in the squirty bottle isn't nearly as hot nor as flavorful.  Yes, they have Mexican Cokes - in 2 sizes!  There's plenty of 'Bertos joints in the area - skip those and head to Los Kiko's.  Solid 4.5 stars.

I have an elderly mom that uses a rolling walker and it needed some bearings. I coulda bought some $2 cheapies on ebay but said screw that - why not get real bearings for the thing that I can actually relube rather than throw out?   Sure, I coulda saved a dollar or two down the road at arrowhead mall at one of the skate shops - but I was in and outta this place in less time than it would've taken me to park at the mall with Bones Reds in hand.   XLNT.

Good tacos. Unique shells - not like those 'bertos places or the del/bells. Rolled tacos are great. 1st time here - we'll be back! Sauces are pretty good too btw.

Super timely quote, which was in line with what I expected it be around. Precision removal of a huge mulberry that was dying and leaning (but in full leaf) over/towards a mobile home. Crew was super fast and efficient. Owner Al said it would take about 3 hours - it took about 3 hours. No damage to the home, tree removed to ground level. Area left without a branch, twig or leaf left in sight.   Look no further than this company if you need trees removed super quick. A+++ Can't recommend enough. Payment by check, CC, Paypal - whatever. Easy as pie. Super great communication from start to finish.

This place is 1/2 craft beer, 1/2 smoke shop. They ONLY carry craft beers, and are willing to try and get whatever you are looking for. Prices are good, selection is good, owners are friendly. Forget those mega-stores and come here if you are in the area.
