Let me start by saying this bar is right by my house so I was hoping that this would be a good one. The first time I went there it was a decent experience, but it seems that things are going down hill. There have been several times when we ordered premium drinks (Jack or Captain) and it seems that they are serving us well drinks but still charged us the premium price! Trust me, I'm a very experienced drinker and know the difference from well whiskey and Jack. The last time my friend and I went there we went in and sat at a table and never got acknowledged. We were there for over 15 minutes and not one waiter or waitress stopped by and they weren't even busy! We finally ended up leaving went to another bar. I won't be back.

I've been driving by this place on my way to work for about 3 years now. I finally decided to stop in with a recommendation from my neighbor. This is now my "go to" Italian place.  The restaurant itself isn't anything fancy, which is what I like. As long as it's clean (which it was) is all that I care about. My Dad and I stopped by on a Wednesday evening which the parking lot was packed (good sign). We were able to get a table in under about 10 minutes.  He ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and I got the Tortellini D Angelo. Dad said that the Fettuccine was some of the best that he's ever had. My Tortellini was also delicious. You could definitely tell that the pasta was made from scratch. The service was also very good. I will definitely be back next time I'm craving some good pasta!

I had the new Prime Rib dip sandwich. Not much good to say about it. The size of the sandwich was very small and it was very salty. I had the cheese curds for the side which wasn't bad.

I had the skillet which was very good. Everything tasted homemade and the service was great. The portion sizes were huge! It definitely made it to the top of my list of places to have breakfast.

I went there on a Saturday morning when they were slow. I assumed that it would be fairly quick, but I was wrong. I was there almost an hour, which I would of been OK with if they did a great job. Ended up having to spend about another hour washing cleaning what they missed. Would of been much cheaper and better just doing it myself at home.

My Dad was in from out of town and wanted to stop by Subway. I would rather support small local restaurants so I got on Yelp and found European Bakery and Café. After speaking with the owner (I'm assuming he was the owner) he recommended getting the Black Forest and Bostonian. Both were a great deal for the price. I actually had leftovers for lunch the next day. I tasted both, which my favorite was the Black Forest. It had some maple turkey, honey ham, honey mustard and some other goodies. They had a big display of cakes which we couldn't resist so we ordered a few to eat later. They were equally just as awesome. I highly recommend stopping by!

I stopped in and had lunch today. Had the burrito with a mix of chicken and steak. It was delicious! Everything was fresh and the right amount of heat. The burrito was so big I don't think that I'll need to have dinner. Definitely will be back!

I stopped by Bootleggers to grab a beer and appetizers. Since I love bacon I went with the Bacon Board and also ordered Nacho Flat. They both were delicious. The bacon board had variety of different types of bacon, from house smoked pork belly to dry cured apple bacon. The nachos had chopped bacon and a chipotle cheddar sauce. Some of the best nacho's I've ever had. I washed everything down with a nice cold beer and a shot of moonshine. I will definitely be back to try an entrée.
