There's not much to say about Honey Bears BBQ...  The food is not as tasty as the smell I sense every early Saturday morning, & it lacks seasoning.  The location is a little sketchy, but is very clean inside the premises and the family staff are very polite.  Personally, the chicken is better than the ribs... But I only went there once & doubt it I will go back...

Server (Julianna) was friendly and took good care of us (party of 10)..... We mainly had drinks but she did a good job keeping tabs!  But... The place itself needs to be remodeled. It's a dump. I always thought it was closed based on outside apperances. But inside is really outdated, restrooms are small and stingy looking. The place smells odd..... & it's dark. A friend ordered something, I tried a bite and was NOT impressed.   Definately won't go back unless dragged by friends like today.

Horrible. This review is from June 5, 2014.  I remember very vividly, the food was horrible! My husband and I went there during lunch time, I ordered a steak (duh) and he had a burger. The steak was extremely thin, looked like some ordinary boring cheap piece of fried beef.  AND it lacked lots of seasoning and color! The manager saw how unhappy I was by the way I was picking at my food, politely asked and I politely told her.  She was nice enough to offer another in which I declined (I can only suffer so much through this horrible food!), well, she took it off the bill thank god......    Drinks were fair, service mediocre, atmosphere boring and smelled like old people.   Never again.

This location is not huge, but it's the cleanest supermarket near the house! Its prices are fair, staff are fairly nice (most are cold and distant), produce snd meat are better than the near by locations but very pricey.  Place is clean, location is convenient.  The Starbucks staff are a bit careless but that's another story.  Anyways, Safeway is great, highly recommend.  (Oh, bathrooms are filthy though).

This place is the worse.  I will make it short & simple:  The staff are rude and careless, and this place is very chaotic.  Purchased expired foul organic chicken in the past; bad fetta cheese; bad meat; and other bad produce that "looked" good from the outside only.  There's plenty to be said about this place; but it's frustrating!!!!  Just know that it's a sh*tty supermarket.  Just happens to be close to home :(

Awful casino. Lacks a decent air vent, full of rude employees & weird customers. The slot machines are the shittiest least fun I've ever seem across the country.   I won't go back there even if they give me free $$$ to gamble.

This place is crap.  If it smells like crap, it must be crap.  Gosh, it smells like a full adult diaper mixed with old people's medication!!! Oh, and the staff have no idea what they are doing.  Went there THREE TIMES: 1st time I didn't have my social security card, and they needed something with the #; a W-2 would do they said.  I had one, as well as a bill in my car for the address proof.  Well, not good enough; had to be a "mailed bill" and an original not copy W-2.  Fine. Come back with a letter from social security plus my original W-2 FROM social security!  Not good enough. Although I've asked the guy if it was okay to bring that... Nope! 3rd time; my husband comes too.  Now we have the damn social security card and each a bill, mailed! They almost didn't take my credit card bill which I almost flipped but then they accepted.  Okay... Went in, watched the dreadful most boring 20 min video ever...... Looked through the useless binder as asked and patiently waited.  1 hour goes by, I was seen only to be told my social security card was bo good because it was LAMINATED!!!!!  REALLY??? NOW YOU TELL ME!!!!! Jerks....... The lady was like "they should've told you at the desk".....& the guy that saw my card was like "OOPPS"..... So unprofessional... So unfair.  Waste of time.  None of the staff knows what they are doing, the place smells really bad and I am not exaggerating....   And the patients look desperate, dirty and sick; which is not a judgement on them but makes you wonder how clean can this clinic be and how much advantange "could" they be taking out of these poor people? Because they only pay you $50 if you weight over 180lbs I think, only the first time!  After that is $45, $35, then only $25!!!! Horrible....   Honestly, I am glad it didn't work out, and I suggest people do some research before going there.  That's my 2 cents....

I "was" excited about this place because I've found an eyebrow piercing similar in size to my old one in which I brought in to show them....   Purchased it; WAS NOT told about their return/exchange policy. Big mistake.... Came home & it was horrible.... The gauge (thickness) is not the same... But the lenght seems aproximate. Anyways..... It fits horribly, it sticks out and I will never wear it. Waste of $40. I take some of the blame, they gave me a lenght I wanted. But it's not the same when the thickness is different, and the person behind the counter should've known that.  She was polite, but was rushing me. Whatever I asked (I know so little about these things), she would say "it's up to you, it's a preference".... On that note, she failed to educate me and sold me a product unfit for my need.  Perhaps an "exhange" policy should take place here. Perhaps this business should warn or at least help the customers in future purchases.  Perhaps I should not shop there ever again. Not that they care.  But personally, I would not recommend this place to anyone.  I just called them and they were a bit rude and useless......  I regret giving my $$$ to a business that doesn't give a d**n about their customers.

I've been there 2x. The first time it was a basic wash, probably the $5 one cause it was just a quick outside rinse.  And they did a great job for the price.  So I went back last friday (02/13/15). Fail. Paid a decent amount, car was supposed to get cleaned inside and out plus an air freshner. Results: CAR WAS NEVER CLEANED INSIDE NOR I'VE RECEIVED AN AIR FRESHNER.  That was the only reason I picked that service. Plus my outside morrors and the outside trunk door was still dirty...  SMH.  I didn't even care to go back that day, they were busy, and did a half-a$$ed service once and would've done it again.

Rumors was the first salon I've tried in Arizona since moving from NJ, and although pricier than I was looking for, I tried it.  Let's just start with, it's not worth the pricey tag.  I went in for a color and cut, a mini make-over as I call it (you will see the pic!), the hairdresser was fairly polite. She clearly didn't care for me 110% but that's another story. The atmosphere was clean, so was the salon. the staff was professional and the although I was late, the time manner I was cared for was great. I left there satisfied with the color and the blow out, was not recommended any special products nor directions to care thereafter. Also, when I asked for advice, while being attended too, I was not given any.   The dilemma: Within 4 days after the hair dye, the color began to fade. I didn't contact the salon because it was a busy 4 day holiday weekend.  By the 12th day, the color was practically all gone.  And I finally went back to the salon, and they fixed it. Not with huge smile in their faces but enough to get me by I supposed.  The stylist was a different one, also polite but cold.  Didn't care to be chatty and I guess wasn't thrilled to be doing a "pro bono" job.  He found a million and one excuses to why the hair color failed. But it wasn't just faded, it was also.... splattered all around.  Like, there were darker spots here and there. It was poorly done, and FYI; I do not have nowhere near a lot of hair, and is very thin! No excuses.... very expensive place, don't waste your money there. This hairdresser recommended a very expensive shampoo & conditioning in which I purchased, it did very little to help with the color.  I left a generous gratuity for him, with hopes he won't be so cold with a "non-paying" customer in the future, and I have no intention in coming back there.   Service and quality is very important in this industry.  I feel ripped off beyond financials from this business....

I like it here:) So far been here 2x; once to see Ralphie May, and the second time when the Improv gave me 4 free tickets to see Andrew Shulz.  Both times I've taken different family and friends, and they all said they too wanted to come back! The venue prices are fair (based on my research and experience), the place is clean and with a friendly professional staff.  I also enjoyed the space; if you are familiar with NYC comedy clubs then this place is perfect! Nothing like NYC, not as crowded and tiny, but small and cozy.  Oh, and is conveniently located to the Tempe nightlife (Mills Ave).   Overall, def recommends! Plus, the drinks are fair priced and the food tastes awesome :-)

Thus far the most GROWN UP mall I've ever been too (and I've been to a few back East)!!!!! There's no kids hanging out (I haven't encountered obnoxious teens wasting time and space there yet, and I've been there during various times of the day, especially during the summer). There's no cheesy stores, mainly top notch fancy stores such as "Tiffany's", "Burberry", "David Yurman", "Loui Vitton", etc.......  I mean, there's a TESLA car showroom inside the mall!!!!!! Anyways, is very clean,  has many nice restaurants (The Yard House is a favorite), and has plenty of parking (plus valet).  Size is decent, not huge but far from small.  Employees at the stores are a bit rude (I don't know if it's me or them, after all; I'm not their financially stable average customer).  The clientale is POSHY, so depending who you are, they might look at you funny.  But it's a great mall, I love their stores and location.  So definately check it out. :)

I never thought I would be reviewing the post office, but that day is here!  This office is the most friendly USPS I've been to in 4 different states in my adult life.  The staff is very polite and professional, attentive, caring, and proficient.  Their small (in terms of ratio of the rest of the building!) but effective window service is cleaner and brighter than many other offices I've seem.  Unlike many "abandoned" offices, this place is trying to stay alive.  For the past six months using their services, thus far nothing has happened to our packages.  Overall, I rather come here than any other nearby offices in Phoenix. :)

This store is a big fail when compared to other Circle K's...... It's very ghetto need to say more... There's frequent cops and ambulances there!!! I live down the street and avoid as much as possible.  The wine and spirits are limited, but they have hard liquor so it's a plus (hence the one star!!!)..... The location is fairly convenient and the clerks are very polite and professional.

So far; tje best bagel I've eaten in Arizona:) As a Jersey girl, it's hard to find decent pizza and bagels so close to that home taste... But Chompies brings it! The cheese bagel is my favorite with thr chives cream cheese!!!! We normally take out but we did eat in once and I loveddd the bloody mary and service! Chicken soup lacked taste, so we'll stick to bagels... :)

Currently I live here. Sooooo, there's a very long pending review awaiting for when I move out (I don't wanna funn[ier] business with the staff).  I tell you the most important & main thing: DON'T MOVE HERE (Unless you are 18 yrs old & wants a cheesy party place).  Keeping it honest.   See you in a few months for the update.

My husband loves BBQ, & Famous Dave's is his happy place!  The staff are very polite, professional, but yet cool! They make you feel comfortable and are chatty.  The environment is both adult & family friendly, with very spacious seating indoor & out (yes, they have the water mist outside!).  I love the unique decor, with all the silly relics and even the plaid picnic table cover during lunch hours!  The food is amazing, extremely generous with proportions and tasty. I thought it was a great idea to have a slice of Texas toast under the BBQ! The sauces are also great, though I miss "Brother Jimmy's BBQ" in NYC, Famous Dave's is close enough!    Attached are the pictures of our feasts, we've only been there 2x since moving to AZ in 6 weeks!  But as you may see in my pics, is a great variety with big portion for the price.  Plus, when the kitchen sent the wrong brisquet, the manager brought us the right one really fast and let us keep the other one!  The drinks are great, very yummy may I say.  My husband & I highly recommend it!

Service varies... There's no consistency at this location, but the bar staff are friendly.  The hostess (I was there saturday night12/20/14) was somewhat cold and dismissive.  She didn't smile or greet me (I was still waiting on my husband) friendly but as she walked the other guests by she had a whole different game face on and even small talked with them.  So clearly, I feel a bit insulted.  Anyways,  the atmosphere here is good, food is okay; I had better at other Red Robins.  Beer is nice and cold, and is a good location for shoppers and/or locals.

This is a great park, nice views; amazing long walks; but dirty waters!  Anyways, I come here often because my husband works in one of the buildings off the park beach.... So I park the car and walk around at early 7am.  People always clean up after their dogs, and is calm.  Water is sadly filthy though.  During events, park is very organized and clean.  Def great for families and young people. :)

Very happy with this place. Great service even right before closing on a sunday! Nice waiting time on the food, and decent prices.    The meals are very clean, healthy, and most of them seem to be gluten free.  I added salt and pepper to my "Brizza" and it was all it needed. Like my husband said "I can actually taste the eggs and all the other ingredients"!!!!! He had a Cuban Panini and soup, free coffee upon checking in with Yelp! He wasn't too happy with their coffee but he's picky. I had the "Chicago Brizza"... Which is like a pizza, with hash browns, sausage, eggs, monterey jack & cheddar as toppings! It was very very filling:) Also, I had an iced green tea. Which was flavored, no idea what flavor but I wasn't told it came that way... Not my favorite but I drank it:)   Anyways, will definately come back! They have a patio but it's facing 7th St so it's a bit noisy. Inside sitting is very comfy if you grab a booth!

It's a Walmart. It's cleaner than the one by Thomas Rd in Phoenix, but of course is a huge mess.  Employees are rude and cold, store smells weird, and it's crowded.    I don't come here often, but as every other Walmart: it could use a lift trainning the employees and maintaining the floor.  Enough said....

I'll make this quick: dislike.  Girl at the register had an attitude, meat was super super thin and dry, they were cheap with it also.  Sauce was watery and tasteless......  It's a rip off... Total failed for a gyro (we had the Chicago Gyro btw).

LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! I mean, it's next to me, very easy to get too; and most important: BEAUTIFUL!!!!   Is very simple, but very grand.  Is a small mountain, an easy climb, the best for starters and children! My friends and us take our East Coasters visitors there when they visit, they all love it.  My nieces are from NYC, 4 year olds, and found it very easy and fun to climb the rock!    I highly recommend it.  Plus, there's the Botanical Garden, The Zoo, Papago Park and more right nearby, walking distances.   TIP: Come during early sunrise hours on a saturday/sunday to avoid the crowd.  You can sit and relax, enjoy the view and take in the nature.  Most of other times you will encounter large crowds, many children, your pictures won't be neat.  Odds are you will be rushed.  So, try to get here during early hours for the weekends' sunrise or just do weekdays for sunsets.

This place USED to be "okay".  Now it sucks.  I came here based in the Yelp reviews, but it was a mistake.  Came here some 4 times with hopes, but nope! Got worse!  Service is average, the place is small and often crowded and slighlty loud. The pink and white gels used to crack alot, and was never evenly filed.  Last time I went there I asked for polish, she was upset it wasn't gel and looked at me funny thereafter.  Anyways, there's the pics for memories.  Oh, they weren't happy with me for sharing the fact that there was a 10% off coupon online at Yelp if you checked in.    Odd.  Oh and; Picked a color that was only available in gel but the lady told me it wasn't available in reg polish. She didnt help me to find a similiar color, then painted my nails in a horrible rush.

Loved it! This place is very authentic, humble, and most important: DELICIOUS!!!! Looks can be deceiving, please don't get scared of the simple looks and may I even say "ghetto" vibe & looks... This place serves a great portion of food, very clean food and staff.  Oh, staff is very polite, very attentive.  Def will be going back for more:)

UPDATE:  Since my little bad experience back in March 2016; the owner has reached out to me and refunded our tickets. I must say; that was very professional and I truly appreciate Stand Up Live taking its time to review this problem.  In general, the place is truly great and food + service is pretty decent too. I do hope that future performers don't pull a "Whitney Cummings" because I would hate to stop going here!   Thank you Stand up Live.

Been here 2x. Awful. First time, the donuts were stale and the coolatta was extremely sweet. Oh, and service was awful. Second time; I'm here because I was nearby. Gave it a second chance; FAIL. Service was even worse... The lady had a long face, dragged her feet taking her sweet time... Iced latte was extremely sweet too so I asked for an extra expresso shot (said I would pay for) but she still gave me attitude saying "well, thats how lattes are made".... I told her "this is not my first latte, just charge me whatever" ...... Another extra $1 to fix her mistake and some burned hash browns later and I learned not to ever come back to this location.

Food was a bit pricey.  Shrimp Lomein was dark colored and thinned tasteless noddles.  They didn't deliver something as simple as duck sauce!  And the wonton soup was horrible!  Wontons were kinda like dumplings, except they don't serve dumplings.  And the texture of the "wonton's dough" was thin, and tasted nothing like a decent soup....  Anyways; the eggroll was really good!  I think they gave us a 3rd one for free, and it had me craving for more!    But unfortunately, I doubt we will order again from them.

This was my first West Coast Peruvian dish, and coming from New Jersey I was disappointed.  Although I was told it was "the best"; I disagree.  I had "Tallarin verde con Bisteck"; & the linguine was overbooked, the sauce was dull and dry.  For the first time I had it with Parmesan cheese, which only made it drier!!!!  The beef was very thin and lacked salt, it was also too small in proportion to the pasta.  The potato was good, crispy.    The appetizer "Papa a la Huncaina" was ok.  Lacked salt and wasn't creamy enough. Also, their sauces (the green sauce being my favorite) was horrible!!!  It wasn't spicy, in fact it tasted like pickles...  Just gross.  Overall, the service was polite, price was ok, comfortable small atmosphere.  Very clean.  It's unfortunate I won't be going back... :(

The food was greaaaat! Let's start with that!!! Drinks were pretty awesome too (had a few Sakeritas!). Athemospere was nice but the music was very VERY loud... Really hard to keep up a conversation when you can't hear anyone... Also, the waitstaff although nice, they did lack on checking up on the table. This review is based on one visit to be fair.... I will definitely go back for the food... Although it was pricy it was very filling. Also, didn't love the location. Hard to find and lacked signs. Still giving them a 5 star for the unique variety of sushi:)

Went back with some friends (it was convenient honestly); and was really disappointed.  Innitially sat by the bar; moved within seconds cause the bartender had an attitude... Not welcoming at all. Seriously, quit your job if you can't deal with people.  Sat in a high table. Waitress had a smile, but was not attentive.  Between forgetting the waters, taking forever to come take our orders, never cared to offer more chips, making us feel rushed "WHENEVER" she was by the table; what pissed me off is just having us wait for the bill to be picked up for quite awhile as she and other staff members walked by it. Eventually someone else (not her) picked it up.... I just didn't get it. Being that it was NOT busy. If it was busy, especially being a saturday night, then okay; give you a pass & a decent tip for trying. But nobody there cared. And being my 3rd time with the lack of a caring service; it's not a "bad night" excuse.   Oh. The food sucked too.  I thought I was the only one, but when the 3 others complained about lack of taste and the meat being hard & rubbery; I knew I wasn't being a diva!  Lol!   And I don't know who picks the music, they might have the worse DJ on Mills.... From Ol' Dirty Bastard & Tupac to EDM; it was hard to get a rhithym going there!!!!   DEF THE LAST TIME! :(

I just love it here. Every store you need is here awaiting for you PLUS the casino is right next door!!! It's always clean and if you check in you get a free coupon book which saves lots of extra $! Or if you have AAA; show your card and you will save $5!!!

This place is great! Been here 2x only; sat outside once and inside the other day. Service was very friendly and the food is AMAZING!!!! I had burgers both time and they cooked the meat spot on. I hate when you tell a restaurant "medium rare" and they serve "medium"! NOT HERE! If you ask for one thing u get exactly that perfect temperature.  My husband had the mac & cheese he build from the u ingredients option and was very very tasty.  Also, their sweet potato tots are yummy but sucks to pay the $2.00 fee instead of getting reg fries. I think $2.00 is a bit much.   Besides that, beer selection is great and atmosphere is chilled. Very clean place, nice big screen tvs inside and will definately come back:)

This place rocks! Love the atmosphere and service but mostly the food.... The wings and other apps are pretty awesome.... Not a huge fan of their mac & cheese cause it lacks salt in my personal opinion but my husband swears by it... The staff is very friendly and the prices are good, the only think I dislike about this location is how crowded the tables are. Their tables set up is way too close to eachother and it can get uncomfortable.... Overall, we enjoy Coach's Corner whenever in the area :)

Only been there once, but it's enough to give them 5 stars unless they give me future reason to change!  This AMC is great, very convenient if you live near the Phoenix 85008 zip code area!  Being new to Arizona is important that I let you guys know that!  Also, is very different from what I was used to in north Jersey.  AMC Theaters in the west coast are much more modern and clean.  This location was very friendly and professional, clean (didn't smell like old popcorn and feet!), and conveniently located near restaurants & nightlife as the cherry on top!    Two important things you must know about this location:  * Parking is available at the garage attached to it.  And the theater will VALIDATE YOUR TICKET UP TO 4 HOURS!  :-) We didn't know this the first time we "attempted" to catch a show and so we left due to lack of parking!!!  * Chairs are extremely comfortable.  Beware.  You might over relax!  Lol!  They are actually leather recliners.....  And seats are assigned for extra convenience!!!  There!  Now go enjoy your show! :)

Came here cause it was in the area; and boy do I wish I was in the area more!!!! I had a pastrami panini and the husband had the srirracha  panini. They both come with a small side of kale salad, and both tasted amazing! Def recommend it! Plus, there's homemade gelato & ice cream. I tried the banana dulce de leche swirl and IT WAS AWESOMEEEE!!!!!! Creamy, fresh and clean taste, not overly sweet, just perfect! Service was great, very polite staff! And clean atmosphere with outdoor sitting:)
