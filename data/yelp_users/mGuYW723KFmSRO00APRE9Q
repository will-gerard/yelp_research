We've come here for a few years now. Good priced food and good tasting. Friendly service. We enjoy getting the dinner combinations...PuPu platter is a goI'd appetizer to share.

Library is a great place to borrow movies, especially if you're not sure if the movie is worth paying for the movie.

Our favorite breakfast place...price is good and you get a big portion of food. Their biscuits and gravy are the best!

Food tasted terrible. Guacamole was a light minty green color, not very appetizing.  The tacos fried way too long. The tortillas used in the mini tacos were super dry. We regret dining at this place. Would probably have had better food at the place we originally wanted to try.

I normally shop at the Ulta near Chandler Mall...went to this one because was in the area...Walked around the whole store trying to find mascara...there was no one around to offer assistance...when I finally did find my brand, they were all out of the mascara that I use (I use several different ones too) Disappointed with this visit.

Love this Water and Ice Store..Employees are friendly. They sell a 50 gallon water card for $10 making it 20 cents a gallon, otherwise water is 25 cents a gallon. Shaved Ice is great during these hot summer months! They also sell Thrifty Brand ice cream.

Every Bed Bath and Beyond location has had awesome customer service. I love their selection of items carried in the stores. They also accept expired coupons and they accept multiple coupons in the same transaction. The way they treat their customers definitely make them keep wanting to come back to their stores!

Received excellent customer service tonight(our previous visit, the waiter wasn't too friendly)...This visit, our waiter went above and beyond..I had mentioned that my daughter was planning on getting the apple cobbler, but ended up not having any room. He surprised us with an order of it packaged to-go....super sweet of him! Thank You!

Everything that we've ordered has always been good here. We especially love the Kalbi short ribs here. The macaroni salad that comes on the side with most of the meals is really good here too. Average price is about $10/person.

Lines are always long here and they never seem to have enough cashiers. I do love that they are willing to take multiple coupons in the same transaction.

Fries were old and cold...they were out of ice. Asked for the sandwich to be plain, it did not come that way. They forgot to give us our drinks.

Second time here and very disappointed. Front staff is nice but the wait time is ridiculous. My appointment time was at 8:00, it is now 8:17. The last time I went here, I waited over 2 hrs. Was suppose to have an ultra sound so my bladder was full of water. I asked a couple of times and all they could tell me was they were backed up...they finally called me back..but it was for my mammogram that was scheduled....told the technician I was suppose to get an ultrasound too and that my bladder was super full and I'd been waiting over two hrs. She went to check with the ultrasound tech..only to find out the front desk didn't put my file with the ultrasound tech. Horrible experience!

Great sale going on right now...hard to find sizes sometimes because everything is mixed. Good deals and good quality clothing.

This Starbucks is located inside Safeway. Service is always friendly here and they have always made our drinks right each time we have been here. Love this location!

Pretty close to authentic Chinese cantonese style food. My dad, born and raised in Hong Kong likes this place quite a bit. Salt and Pepper pork chops and Honey Walnut Shrimp are a must try.

Nice facility. They have four indoor basketball courts here and two indoor soccer fields. We are here often for basketball tournaments...makes it nice to play multiple games at one location. Nice food area...items are reasonably priced.

We had a party of 33, so I called ahead of time. The person I spoke to on the phone didn't seemed too thrilled about a large party coming in. I was a little worried about that because we have been to restaurants where service was horrible because of large parties. However when we got there, everyone was really friendly. Our waiter we got on our end of the table provided excellent customer service. The lady I had spoke to on the phone stated that everyone on the same bill must sit together. Our waiter allowed for our kids to move around and said he will work with whatever we decide to do. He went above and beyond! The food was excellent as well! We enjoyed this location the best (we've been to three locations in California)

We first had pizza from here at a friend's house. They ordered the pepperoni, cheese, and bbq chicken pizza. I didn't think I would care for the bbq chicken pizza, but it was surprisingly delicious!  My son and his friend had basketball practice that evening and this pizza was light and not heavy, so that was a good thing.  Went to H&H later than evening to order my husband a pizza (forgot what its called, but had Italian meats) for dinner after he was done with work. He enjoyed it a lot too!  We have been back here several times. Each time service has been friendly and pizza wonderful. Highly recommend this place!

This was the first time we had been to Bahama Bucks...we heard about it from a friend and decided we needed to try. Definitely not disappointed!! Ordered the Cherry Bahama Rama Mama...it was delicious! The "baby" size was more than enough. Will definitely be going here again!
