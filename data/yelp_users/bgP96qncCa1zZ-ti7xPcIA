I'm a Bobby Flay fan, so this review is probably biased.  I came here for lunch during a brief stay in Vegas.  It was wonderful.  We had a reservation, and were seated immediately. The server attended us quickly and made a few recommendations on their drinks.  They have an extensive tequila menu, so I went with a margarita, their specialty.  For an appetizer we had the tuna nachos. They weren't really nachos, but they were very good.  For my main dish, I had the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash.  I would eat this every day for the rest of my life.    I don't have anything else to add to the review, because everything is perfect and I want to eat here every day.

I always wanted to stay at The Mirage, and I finally did on my last visit.  It's not the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, but it's still pretty nice.  The regular rooms are a very decent size, are modernly decorated, have nice beds, all the TV/WiFi stuff, a big bathroom and an acceptable shower -- all things I look for in a hotel that I'm paying over $100 on a Tuesday night in April (aka, more than a lot of other hotels in the area).   I LOVED their pool.    The bars here were also cool - I really liked the look of Revolution; The Beatles bar that is in the casino, but we didn't have a chance to check it out.   We did brunch at their in-casino buffet, and it was just okay too.

This wasn't my first time to Hofbrauhaus, but it was my first time to this location.  Just a short taxi trip off the strip, Hofbrau is a beer drinkers delight.  German beerhall fashion tables, live music a liter beers.  What more could you possibly want?  There's more.   During our hour or so long visit, (plus a short wait), many, many people were spanked, yes spanked, by the more than willing females servers.  We did not partake, but it was fun to watch.   In addition, the cheerful dancing on benches, live music, and stein holding contests were all exciting, fun happenings to keep us entertained.  We went for the pretzels and sausages and the food was quite good as well.   Prost!

I came to this studio based on the great Yelp reviews, and a personal recommendation, however I must say I was very disappointed.  The area seems to be under construction, so perhaps I had a bad visit. My brother lives in Vegas, so I was exploring the area while in town during a visit, and for future visits.   First, the check in and the studios are disconnected, not sure if this is due to said construction, but it seems... off.  Second, there's no self serve water and that's annoying.  Third, the studio floor is disgusting.  The worst I've ever been in, and I've probably been to 30 yoga studios over the past five years.  I don't know how they can possible clean the weird, wiry, porous surface thoroughly, especially with it being a hot studio and sweat flying all over, you'd have to power wash it frequently.  Fourth, it stank. Bad. Probably due to the gross flooring.  And fifth - And perhaps this one is a local thing, you are ASKED to TIP the teachers.  I have never ever heard of this, but this is the only place in Vegas I've been for yoga.  This is not asked of in LA or San Diego.   Next, the teaching. The 2 stars is perfect.  It was meh. I've experienced better.   I am grateful that the first class is free, because I will never, ever come back here.

Vegas has a lot of hotels to choose from, and pretty much all of them have pools.  So why the Mirage?  Well their pool is great.  It's also close to the dolphin exhibit, so it's like you're sharing the same water, except you aren't.   The Mirage Pool has a large area for laying out, a bar area, a few water falls and tons of chairs.  They also have pool side service and extra large Mojitos (like 64 oz, seriously).  If you're traveling with little ones -- have no fear.  Mirage Pool comes staffed with life guards.   The water temp was just right, and it wasn't too crowded.

Really cool brewery/brewpub with an indoor/outdoor setting.  I came here for brunch and had one of the $10 mimosa/entree deals (great price!).  I had the avocado toast, and it was very yummy... although it's kind of hard to screw that one up.   Dog and family friendly.  There was also a cornhole tournament going on during my visit, as there is a large outdoor area.   Sadly, I didn't get to try any of the beers on my visit, but the list was full of local Arizona beers.  If I return to Phoenix, I will stop by here again to try the beer!
