Love Chen's super fast and tasty. Haven't had anything bad here. Perfect for those nights where you just don't want to cook and you're hungry now.

I've been going here since 2005 and it hasn't changed a bit! The staff is friendly, but seem kind of shy. The food is always great and for the price, can't beat that. So much better than Filberto's. And it's super clean. Thanks for such a great little Mexican joint! The only request I have is you should add Al Pastor to your menu :)

This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else.

Not Vegan? Hey neither am I! However, if all Vegan food tasted like this I would never eat meat again! I got a Big Wac based on reviews, fries, side of ranch and a chocolate chip cookie. Tasted just like McDonald's minus the horrendous guilt and shame that follows about 2 minutes after you start eating. Ranch was very dill-y and garlic-y, which I loved. Cookie was crunchy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Will be going back again soon!

I've been meaning to go here for at least year, but almost always wound up at Joy Ride or Postino. Now I grieve that year that was without Federal! I was having a bad day and did not feel like cooking at all or interacting with any more people, and remembered this place has a drive-thru. It took me awhile to figure out what to try, but the girl taking my order on the phone was super patience and helpful. My order was ready when I arrived 15 minutes later and the smells that filled my car were purely intoxicating. When I got home and finally was able to try the handmade ravioli I was starving, but the flavor was so amazing and unique that I had to eat slowly and savor it. Truly one of the absolute best pasta dishes I have had in my life. Italian food in PHX tends to be below subpar, but this, this is a stand alone. I was so blown away I saved a few for my husband for when he got home later. It was still incredible warmed back up. I also had the Great Little Salad, which lived up to its name nicely. Can't wait to go eat in soon!
