Dr. Grade exudes professionalism, I appreciate her attention and detail when I have an appointment. I have never had a doctor that I was completely comfortable with, I would recommend her and the office to everyone.

Great location! Right near my office, we actually held a small meeting in there. Love the gelato and crunchy ice for my water (I like crunchy ice). The service was excellent and their pizza smelled wonderful (we didn't know they served lunch!).  Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is in Downtown Scottsdale in need of a sweet treat.

What can be better than drinking coffee while reading comics?  In my opinion, nothing, especially if you and free wi-fi service! The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable about comics. Miguel is awesome, if you can't find a certain comic he will say "I probably have it in the back, come back and I can pull it for you", don't forget to ask for a recommendation on a series.  Oh yeah! You have to try the Dark Knight, so good.

I have tried again and again with this Dunkin' Donuts location, but each time have been highly disappointed with the service. They are snippy, curt and I have seen some unclean practices.  If you want to go to a better DD, there is one on Frank Lloyd Wright, one off Raintree and one on Hayden southbound. I gave it one star because I like DD.

Seriously wish I can give this company more stars!! The BEST cab company around, first time I tried I called the number on their site, driver confirmed via phone and they use Square if you only have a credit card .  Dave was the second driver that picked me up and he is my regular driver (don't have a car at the moment.) Super nice, always on time and one of the friendliest person I have ever met.  If you see a red car that says "TruCab" use them and recommend them to your friends!    BTW, if you need a ride for an early morning flight, they provide complimentary coffee and donuts, no joke. HOW AWESOME IS THAT.
