Love stopping in here on First Fridays. Usually love the pieces here. I really liked the piece in the tiny back room during the March FF. It made a great statement in a new way on our weight obsessed culture.

I'd come back here. Can't think of much I didn't like, except maybe the bathroom. But even that wasn't too bad. It fit in with the rest of the place. I didn't have high expectations so I wasn't disappointed. Actually, I was worried I wouldn't really like the bar food before we got there.  The bartender was awesome. The menu is small & simple but they have fried mushrooms & zucchinis for about $6. Instant points there. I expressed interest in these but I also wanted a sandwich. I got a TBA which is turkey, bacon, avocado, & tomato on toasted bread. I asked for no mayo. That was about $7 & some change. Best part? The bartender hooked me up with a basket of 1/2 mushrooms & 1/2 zucchinis as my side. I totally lucked out.  Only thing I'd do differently is get a margarita with Jose instead of whatever tequila I was talked into drinking.  Oh, another awesome win is that Pomeroy's is right down the street from my fave 'bertos. But hey, the food is so good I probably won't end up across the street for Mexican.

Some dick sucker punched someone in the parking lot. I gathered the guy who was punched is the cook, Alex? Luckily, he's gonna be ok. It was just strange to drink with so many cops in the bar, but I did it anyway. The cops didn't care.  I drove from the I-17 & Bethany to come here to get some fried zucchini's & mushrooms. I was already drunk & got a craving. (Edit: Ok, I personally didn't drive. I don't drink & drive. EVER)  Nick, the bartender is always great. Props to his customer service. The fryers were still on because of the commotion even though the kitchen should have been shut down. He hooked me up even though he didn't have to. I appreciate that.  Don't get the impression that cops at Pomeroy's is a common occurrence, it's not. Don't you dare let my review that includes a 1/2 assed bar fight dissuade you from coming here. I'm still planning on coming back here, AGAIN!

I do NOT like Saturdays here. The day definitely does matter when it comes to this place.  The crowd is young, even the 'tenders! Like, under 25 young. Hispters, casual, retro, drunk, snobby, loud, rude, semi cute guys, ugly girls, lustful. Hmm do I not like hanging out at a bar with people my own age?! Gosh, my generation can suck sometimes. Did I get the word RUDE in there? Oh yeah, I did.  The bartenders are nice. Nick doesn't work on Saturdays. Alex's head is fine. He's great.  The jukebox SUCKS! The selection is shitty. It's just crap.  I'm apologizing in advance for this next bit. I don't care if this girl reads this. I fought hard to bite my tongue at the bar. I can't hold it in any longer. This goes out to the chubby biotch with the streaky bad dye job so called highlighted hair. Shut your ugly mouth & go pick songs you'd like to hear instead of loudly yelling about how shitty you think other people's song selections are. If I ever see you again, & you open your loud mouth, I just might shove my glass down your throat to shut your ignorant rude tasteless heifer ass up. Ps. those guys you were hanging all over weren't even interested in you either. They were just too drunk to care. One of these days that nasty look you throw people for no reason will result in a heap of shit coming your way, girlie. Wait, you were a girl, right???

I would give this place 5 stars but I think 1 time they got my order wrong & gave me beef instead of chicken. Maybe I just wasn't clear enough?  That saying, I live on 35th Ave & will drive all the way to 7th just to eat here. Why? Because I TRUST it!! I've been here countless times, all sober except 1 time. The ex who got me addicted to this place had been here countless times before me. I've NEVER gotten sick & he hadn't either.  I usually get a chicken chimichanga combo (beans & rice) with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi is always fantastic. Perfectly crispy & huge with cheese on top. They don't put anything BUT chicken in. If you get beef you get onions & green bell peppers mixed in. With a drink this costs about $8.50.  The sour cream & guacamole has never been bad & always tastes just fine.  There was 1 time that the beans were way too salty but they're usually perfect w/ melted cheese on top.  I love the free pico de gallo. YUMM!!  I've also gotten the fish taco's a couple times. They're perfect except the sauce is strait mayo. If I don't think about that then I enjoy the foodgasm in my mouth just fine.  I've gotten a breakfast burrito once but can't remember exactly what I got. I do know I asked them to add an ingredient & they did with no prob. I remember that tasting way better than I thought it was going to.  For a drink I always ask for a large horchata, no ice. It's perfect. Not gritty or fake over the top sweet. I like mine with a strong cinnamon flavor & this place has that.  Oh, & by the way... the guys working here have always been nice. Yes, I've waited a tad longer than I'd have liked to (maybe 2-3 times) but the guys having good senses of humor makes up for that.

Yes, I realize I'm probably risking my health by coming here but I just can't help but like it anyway.  It's cheap & there are lots of options food wise. They even have basic sushi rolls. That's a major plus in my book! Everyone seems to go for the crab, but I don't. If you want crab I suggest sitting where you can watch them put it out. Hustle your butt to grab choice pieces before everyone else.  Keep in mind the people seating you barely speak English. There's always a language barrier. They're really only there to clear plates away.  You shouldn't look around too much while there. The whole place is pretty divey but the food is good & replaced often enough. If decor is important to you don't come here. If you just want to chow down on all sorts of cheap food goodness then drop by. You'll leave stuffed & happy.

I've flown out of terminal 4 & 2. Don't think I've ever been in 3. As a kid I used to love the moving sidewalks in 4. Now as an adult I seem to always fly out of 2.  My last trip out went well. My flight was for 6:30am. I showed up at about 5am & made it to the gate with 20 min to spare. It was ridiculously easy to park in the West Economy lot & walk right to terminal 2.  There didn't seem to be enough people working to hand out boarding passes or take your luggage you want to check. We had to stand there and wait for a while even though there were hardly any people in line at the time. Also, the guy that took our luggage was rather grumpy.  The security line went well. The people working security were actually rather nice. I forgot to take my shoes off & the guy joked with me about it while I took them off.  All in all, I've always liked my home town airport.

I think I'll steal Ayesha's style of review for my own on this 1.  I'd like to preface this review with these things:  1. I was taken here on a first date. It was great! 2. I'm an animal lover. I respect animals for actually having unappreciated intelligence. I hear horses remember people who treat them well. 3. I don't care about poop 1 way or another. I can say that I'd rather deal with horse poop than human poop though! It's just digested grass. Humans eat all sorts of processed foods. Now that's gross.  Alrighty, let's get to it.  $30 for an hour. Not bad, not bad.  This place helped me realize I don't feel like a beginner anymore. I took beginner lessons for a few years every summer in my pre tween years. I was worried I'd forgotten everything. I haven't! Going here brought back a lot of my lessons. They don't teach a darn thing here. They help you up on your horse & demonstrate, "Left to go left, right to go right." They tell you to get after your horse for trying to eat along the way too.  I'm tired of constantly "walking" my horse. There was no trotting of any kind. I practically pleaded to just go a teensy bit faster. Nope, didn't happen.  I actually own boots. Everyone else has tennis shoes on. Lots of out of towners come here to try out riding a horse.  I got snapped at because I was going to walk around the back of my horse. I'm not dumb, I KNOW I'm supposed to let the horse know I'm there by keeping my hand on him all the way around. Again, no quick teaching here at all. They don't ask you questions to determine your knowledge when you sign the waiver.  I know they have to take precautions because of all the people who have never been on a horse before, but I don't need babying. I could get my butt in & out of a saddle when I was 11, on my own. I can certainly do it now.  I did really enjoy this, I'm just frustrated by feeling held back.  The guides kind of give you flora & fauna info along the way. The people working here are nice. I just couldn't help but chuckle while thinking my grandmother would blow this kid out of the water with the plethora of information she knows.  You can volunteer here & maybe eventually work your way to having a job! Gotta be there by 6am though. Some people here work for tips. TIP YOUR GUIDE  The horses do all have names, & you learn the name of yours.

Starting out with the obligatory sentence about being the only people there until the end of our meal. My boyfriend and I weren't sure we should stay. Thankfully, we did. This place deserves an increase in patrons. Does the location just make it hard to find? They could probably benefit from a sign on the street, not just the building.  I feel like we kept it decently simple with malling kawny (chicken lentil soup), half order of tandoori chicken, lamb curry, garlic naan, mango lassi, and Indian tea. Everything was as good as we hoped it would be. The lassi was better than others I've had. I'm really really glad I tried the tea on a whim.  The manager, Raj Rani served us. She split the soup for us since we mentioned we'd just share it. At the end of our meal she brought us two doughnut hole sized and shaped cakes soaked in honey.

I grew up in Phoenix. I am NOT an out of town visitor. I did not actually sleep at this hotel, but I did show an out of town friend the elevator view.   My friend made it all the way to the top before I discovered he doesn't like elevators. Obviously he's not a complainer. Poor guy. But the view is nice & the ride is fast & smooth. It was fun for me at least.  We made our way to the 2nd floor & looked at the statues scattered around posed doing trapeze tricks. They're like the ones outside the Herberger. These are taller & have animal heads though.  I'd like to comment on Deb L's review. She'd like for the Hyatt to "Remodel to a contemporary look that embraces the southwest feel." Omg, NO! I've always thought of his downtown hotel as kind of swanky. I've been to the Compass Restaurant. Any cheesy Southwest decor would make this place revolting. I'm so tired of the overly used fake cowboy motif. Thank you Hyatt for trying to keep Phoenix at least semi-classy.

I was so disappointed in Pete's.  Went with a friend to get a variety & share. We had a hard time distinguishing between a few of the items we got until we bit in, & even then we weren't 100% sure which was which.  Fish 2 pc $3.70 - Thin with too much batter but a decent flavor. Wouldn't get again. Shrimp 4 pc $3.65 - Was there even a taste to these? Wouldn't get again. Oysters 4 pc $3.65 - Very fishy. There were actually good. I'd get these again. I liked them. Crabettes 4 pc $3.65 - I barely remember these, that's how unimpressed I was. Was this even crab?! Wouldn't get again. Scallops 5 pc $3.85 - Good. Might get these again if I ever went back. My friend liked these. Chips - What word comes to mind? I think gross might describe these. Sauce - It was ketchup! I HATE ketchup. I wanted tarter sauce. This was the biggest disappointment. I was so bummed out.  FYI it's cash only. Also, be prepared to be approached by people asking for money or a meal if you go here, even if you're in the drive-through.

This place is hard to rate. I didn't like the bar itself, but I ran into plenty of people I knew & made quite a few new friends.  This isn't a "lounge" by any stretch of the word.  Turn right & you walk into an openly spaced, brightly lit dive bar. The bar is huge & there are booths along the close wall. There are a few pool tables on the far side. It's so damn bright & open i actually felt uncomfortable. The bathrooms are indescribably gross. The stench of piss is so rank & strong that just thinking back on it makes my stomach turn. There was NO TOILET PAPER the whole night even though I mentioned it to the female bar tender who said she'd take care of it.  If you turn left you walk into a tiny, warm, dark, low ceilinged room. The bar is horseshoe shaped & needed 2 people behind it, not 1. There are tables, but I had no hope of getting to sit at 1. There were just too many people in that itty bitty room. Close to 1am the bartender ran out of small glasses. She started serving mixed drinks in ridiculously small plastic cups. I hope she still put $4 of alcohol in them. But I doubt this. I had to drink way too many drinks to even feel a buzz. There was no way I'd be able to get drunk here. At least the beer is cheap, I guess.  The name Hidden House is appropriate. This place should be hidden from sight & left to die. Why do cool people I know come here?!

Korina A, you're out of your ever loving mind lol.  I used to agonize before getting a hair cut. I'd worry endlessly that I'd get a bad cut. Maybe I just won't like it. Maybe the stylist won't listen to me or understand what I'm asking for. Maybe this, maybe that... while I gnaw my nails away with anxiety.  Then I came here. I leave feeling sexy & great. My hair has been transformed from it's outgrown shaggy state to sleek, fresh, fun, flirty, bouncy, & cute. All for $13! And don't forget to tip!  There are people who only come to see Angie. I love her. But I also like this very tall African American woman who's name I can't recall. She cut my hair last time & did a phenomenal job. I'm prone to flyaways & my hair is fine. She worked my hair just right to help me hide my flyaways & give my hair volume.  So yes, I still worry about my hair. But it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm comfortable knowing I'll leave feeling & looking better.  I sure as heck won't pay $30+ for a salon cut. Only time I've done that was the only time my fears were completely founded. My hair SUCKED.  Great Clips, I'm a loyal customer :) Thank you!

I love Thai Rama. This place has been here for as long as I can remember. Tom kha gai is phenomenal. It's hot and sour chicken soup with ginger, lime, and coconut milk. I've gotten this twice from this location and I swear it has mushrooms in it even though the online menu doesn't list them. Beware the galangal in the soup. It's basically a type of ginger, but don't bite into it. It's just there for flavoring and they usually leave it in big square or rectangle chunks. I'm a garlic fan. Can never have enough so the gratiam prig thai is a go-to dish for me too. It's a meat in a spicy garlic sauce. I choose chicken and it's never been dried out or rubbery.

How am I going to review this place? Did I actually get tricked into coming here? How... ??? What... ??? Did I really just see THAT much nudity & debauchery in 2 hours? My life has forever changed... Wow, I'm going to TRY to write a coherent review. God help me. Who knew all it would take to snap me out of any bi-curiousness I may have had was strippers.  Pros: You can get drunk on the left & then go watch full nudity on the right. Everything was 2 for 1. 2 beers? $4.50. That was awesome. Is that just Wed? The black lights turned my vodka tonic a light colored neon blue.  The girls that talked to us were nice. The girl who gave my friend a dance worked hard & deserved her money. The bouncers looked very capable. The music. Heard some stuff I didn't think I'd hear. Major plus!  Cons: Could the parking lot be any more crowded? Holy hell. Kind of dingy. Sitting in those chairs freaked me out a little. The locks in the restroom on the left are broken! The bartender watered our White Russians down. It was gross. We complained & it was rectified.  Now, let me say that just because I gave this place 4 stars doesn't mean I ever want to come back. I have had my fill of strip clubs, be it this place or any other.

I WILL BE BACK!! The vibe was great. There was just something about this place that jived well with me.  There's an entrance in the front & back. Keep in mind that I used the front.  Karaoke 7 days a week. They have a HUGE book. The regulars mostly sing country. At about 11 a younger more rock style crowd might come in.  Wooden dance floor up front.  2 pool tables on the right. There are also darts of course.  You can sit all the way around the square shaped bar. I love the big tv's above the bar.  There are mirrors everywhere.  The bartenders introduce themselves & are the most friendly I've come across yet. Great bartenders, great crowd.  The drinks are strong :D Kudo's! Ask Brianna (spelling?) for a "piece of ass". Can't remember what was in it but it got me drunk. There are 4 beers on tap, but you get a frozen glass with bottled beer.  Restroom seemed clean enough. It smelled good as least. The lighting is only above the 2 stalls. No touch ups for the ladies going on here.  5 drinks between 2 people came out to about $25.

Dropped by for a quick drink on St. Patty's. Heather was working.  They had FREE stew & rolls. Yum!  Daren C asked me about their steak fry on Monday's, which I didn't know about. I asked about that while there & it's totally true. Might have to check that out some time...  Found out their karaoke doesn't start till 9.  The light over the sink was on this time. Had a girlie touch up moment.  Hadn't wandered over to the pool tables last time but there is a shuffleboard table along the wall too.

They hired a new bartender. It was his first night on Sat. If I remember correctly I think his name is David. Gosh, I'm probably totally wrong though.  Anyway, he's tended at a couple different places. He made 1 damn good Jamaican 10 Speed. I dislike Malibu so I asked for Parrot Bay. Delicious. I hope he sticks around for a while.  There was a late last call on Sat too. They were still serving right up till 2. They pretty much called last call at 1:50. So I think we got out of there around 2:15.  Oh, & I finally spotted the juke box. I've walked right past it quite a few times. I think when I look around for the juke box I picture the ones from the 50-70's or so. I'm looking for big, tall, brightly lit, & maybe orange or yellow colored. I'm so spastic sometimes lol  Restroom light was on again too :)  Come any day of the week. It's always fun here.

I LOVE this place! I've been here about 10 times. I'll come with my mother & I've brought 3 different friends here too.  I'll really can't remember everything I've tried here but I'll try to get most.  Soup: Miso $1.50 - Only had once but remember liking it.  Drinks: I always order iced tea. I've gotten hot tea 1 time & will NEVER order it again. It tasted like sulfurous barf. My mom & I were a little grossed out by it. Their sake is ok. Not really my style though. They do have a sake bomber special but I can't remember the price.  Rolls: Alaska $9.50 - Good California $4.25 - Always great. Dragon $9.95 - My fave roll. Won't leave until I get this 1. Dunlap $8.95 - I always get this mixed up with the Dragon but this is good too. Philadelphia $5.95 - I like it, a friend of mine likes it, my mother did not. Rainbow $9.75 - Always good. Love getting this 1 because it's a variety all in 1! Tootsie $5.95 - Good, not a huge fan. Tuna $3.95 - Simple but good. I believe my mother & I got a Hawaiian $8.50 once & we didn't like it. Also, I can't remember the name but I've gotten a California roll topped with roe. That was good too. My friend wasn't sure he'd like it so the chef gave him a spoonful of roe to taste. I know I've had a few more but can't remember which is which.  Nigiri & Sashimi: Tuna - I don't always get this. Shrimp - I don't always get this either. Fresh water eel about $4.95 I think - I will always get 1 of these. Sometimes 2 orders. Salmon - My fave after the eel. I've either gotten squid or octopus 1 time but it was hard to eat so I haven't tried again. It was tasty though.  Inari about $2-3 - I love this no matter where I go. Sometimes it's been packed full of rice & chilled. Other times a little skinny & room temp if they're in a hurry :(  The people working are always friendly. Sit at the bar if you want to talk to the chefs.  I like sitting at the bar, my mother likes a table though.  There are 2 tv's if that's important to you. I've asked to change the channel & they've let me.  I've done the all you can eat (AYCE) for $25.95. It wasn't worth it. I've never done it again. No way can I eat that much. Don't think you can take leftovers home from the AYCE either. But why would you have leftovers anyway?!  If something isn't on the menu you choose (green is AYCE, white is not) you can write it in or ask for it.

I think they're starting to remember me.  Yellow tail - Yummy! I'm gonna get this again.  Eel Tempura roll $8.95 - This comes warm & covered in crispy tempura. It was really good. Think this 1 was cut into 4 or 5 pieces.  Rock n' Roll roll $9.95 - This has shrimp tempura in it & it's really good. It was cut into 5 pieces.  Dragon roll $9.95 - Great, like always. They usually cut it up into 8 pieces.

This is a little far from me, but I had a friend bring me their Honey Barbeque wings 1 time. Those were some of the best darn honey bbq wings I've had. Too bad I don't live closer. I'd definitely be coming here more often.

This was probably the best Jack experience I've had.  It is a tradition I have with one of my girlfriends to grab a couple tacos after a show or some drinking. Basically, just a late night.  We pulled up at something like 3:30am.  The guy at the drive through was ridiculously nice. I'm still talking about how nice he was 3 days later!  They still had their shake machines running. They ran out of whipped cream for my friend's shake so he asked if she wanted extra ice cream or cherries on top. We said go for it! Gosh, we got extra ice cream & like, 6 or 7 cherries lol  Oh yeah, & the taco's? Fresh. Stuffed. Hot. Greasy. GOOD! Why do we like these mini coronary inducers? Guilty pleasure. My friend & I agreed, these were better than other Jack tacos we've had.

2.5 stars  I've gone with my mother to buy appliances here. It was a good experience. They're on the bottom floor.  My last trip? Not the best.  They have some funny clothes here. I spent almost 10 min laughing at just 1 jacket. I'm not even going to describe it just in case someone reads this who bought 1 of those jackets. Those clothes provided some good laughs at the end of my mall roving trip.  There are NO mirrors! I don't want to have to go into a dressing room just to see what a jacket looks like. I couldn't find a mirror to save my life! Really, the only mirror is the big round 1 close to the ceiling so people can watch for shoplifters. W... T... F...  The restrooms were a disaster! Just gross. There are 2 sinks but only 1 mirror in there too. What's with Sears & mirrors?!  Anyway, I saw 1 shirt that was semi cute. Maybe if I was more country plaid style... Too bad it was the last 1, & a small. Like my boobs would fit in that?! Pfsh! Ha!

DO NOT STAY HERE!  I found a pubic hair on 1 of the pillows. Yes, I know it was a pube. Omg... traumatized.  There were blood droplets on the pillows too. Yeah, they were small, but that is so so SO nasty I can't even describe it.  I think there was a condom floating in the pool. And if it wasn't a condom then I have no clue what it was. I don't want to know.  I'm not sure if it's their soap, or what, but something is freaking caustic here! I washed my hands 3 times that night. By the 3rd time they were on fire, lobster red, chapped, & had started bleeding. Thank the lord that my friend had Dr. Bronner's body balm. I would have been miserable & in considerable pain.  This is easily the worst Motel 6 I have EVER stayed in. And I've gone across the country in Motel 6's. I don't care if it's only $49. It's not good here.

I was born & raised in Phx. It's a habit of mine to carry a bottle of water EVERYWHERE I go. Ever been dehydrated? I have. It sucks, big time. I walk in with my purified bottle of water & get, "You can't have that in here. No outside beverages allowed." It's a bottle of water. Are you effing serious? Major points lost there. You can't truly ever redeem yourself after that. I'll continue though...  For 2 drinks it was over $11.  This place is huge! It's so big I lost my friend for a second because I looked away & he'd gone around a corner.  This place is more like a pool hall with a huge bar in the middle & TV's with varying sports on them.  There's a wall of TV's of different sizes towards the front. Almost each one has a different sport on it. Sensory & sport overload.  The lady bartender who gave me crap about my water was just unpleasant the whole time I was there. Even without the whole water thing I still would have thought she was a b*tch.  My friend accidentally spilled his drink & they tried to tell him they were out of Midori. 2 seconds later they start telling him they'll get more from the back. Make up your damn minds.  The only slightly redeeming qualities about this place is the juke box & restroom. I remember the restroom being clean. I didn't see anyone choosing music but what got played was stuff I liked.  All in all this place was a failure.

This is IN Metrocenter Mall on the upper level.  Perfumania is just across the way so if you have allergies I'd recommend either holding your breath as you pass or going downstairs.  My last trip here was for the guy I was on a date with. We were mall roving & he wanted to stock up on some stress relief aromatherapy items. I remember carrying his bath salts for him since he wanted so many things. Yes, my good ol' boy from North Carolina who's a wildfire firefighter wanted to go here. He's cute, rugged, & he smells good. Jackpot!  I LOVE the coconut lime scented items. I have the hand soap, body wash, & lotion. Yum :)  I was sniff sniff sniffing away & 1 of the only other scents I found I liked was the Lilac Blossom. $20 for a candle though? Yeah, not happening.  This place has tons of testers out. I watched a girl accidentally spritz her boyfriend in the eye. Ouch!  They have a sink!!! I washed my hands with Pink Grapefruit. They smelled good.  Only thing I HATE about shopping are the employees constantly asking you if they can help you. I don't know! I just walked in. 5 seconds later another employee will ask the same question. I was asked 3 different times. Ugh, back off!  1 employee asked if she could help & then went on to say I could mix & match kitchen things with whatever I was smelling. I couldn't help but smile a little. She was overwhelming me with fast talk & info about things I didn't care about. It was 1 of my nervous I-don't-know-what-to-say smiles. She, rather bitchily asked, "What's so funny?" My strait faced reply to her attitude was, "Well, I'm not spending money in your store." She walked off.

There is a pizza God, for prayers have been answered I didn't even know I was making. These folks are authentic.  That was the best darn veggie and chicken pizza I have ever had. I can't even begin to explain the difficulty I have with finding pizza exactly the way I want it since I'm pollo-pescetarian. It's so freaking hard to find places with chicken as an option. Tender chicken, big fresh vegetables, lots of cheese, crispy on the bottom... hell yes! Btw, there's beer too.

I effing HATE this place!  I will only come here for a band I just can not miss.  Tickets - Online in advance is more expensive than buying at the door. They'll charge you like $6 for buying online & another undisclosed $3 for will call. Lying cheating bastards.  Lines & waiting - I didn't have to wait at all. There were barely any people there yet. I got there at 6:30 and ended up pretty close to the stage.  Frisking & pat downs - These will be done by a same gendered person. Girls, they'll want to look in your purse. This is pretty much against the 4th Amendment: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated..."  But if you bitch they have the right to refuse service/entrance. Fun!  Decor & cleanliness - It's pretty dirty everywhere. But that's to be expected. Lots of people coming & going all the time. You'll look up to see that the ceiling is bare & exposed. Pray your bladder holds out on you until you can get to another location. Don't even go into the restrooms if you don't have to, you'll wish you had a hazsmat suit on. Yuck!  Drinks - There's a bar & they don't separate people under 21. I imagine it would be easy for an older friend to get under 21 people drunk in the crowd :D  Heat - It's constantly hot. No matter what the weather outside is like go dressed like you do in the middle of summer phx heat. There was 1 lousy fan blowing. It might as well not even have been there.  Music - For some reason between bands they play weird music that doesn't fit the style you're there to see. I saw Fireworks, Saves the Day, Hellogoodbye, & New Found Glory. They played 80's pop music. Ok...  Sound - The sound didn't suck as much as other reviews led me to believe. It's up to the band to make the sound people get it right. Hellogoodbye made sure they sounded good. Saves the Day, not so much.  Security - Never enough!!! There were some big beefy dudes up front to push back or catch the crowd surfers. I saw 2 guys actually in the crowd. With all the moshing going on, that's not gonna cut it. People got kicked in the head, elbowed, spit on, stepped on, pushed, almost crushed, & even I almost got into a fight w/ a short asshole mosher that might have been a guy... perhaps when his balls drop. Prepare to leave with bruises.  Basically, this place is like an armpit or perhaps the donkeys ass of venues. Fail.

Thursdays are DEAD here. But not over at Myst ;)  They don't open the upstairs.  There were 6 people getting drunk. Not even hot people.  It was just lame. I hope no one I know ever suggests this place again.

My St. Patty's night ended here. I so wish I could give 1/2 stars. I wanna say 4.5. This place was almost close to perfect.  An actual Irish guy (accent & all) drank with me. Need I say more?! That made my night. He was celebrating his b-day with another friend of his from South Africa. I asked him what he thought of our Irish pubs here in AZ. He said it wasn't too bad & that Rosie's was pretty close to the real deal. He then proceeded to point out good whiskeys they had. If the Irish guy likes Rosie's then so do I!  This place was popping off when I showed up around 11. TONS of people. Of course they had their parking lot sectioned off too. Dear lord but there were a lot of cops around :(  The pub felt close & cozy. Service was fast. Didn't see any girls running around in ridiculously short plaid skirts like at Finnegans though.  Guinness was $6. Ugh lame! I got hooked up though. The bartender handed me a larger glass than other people's while winking at me. My new Irish drinking buddy ordered 3 Irish car bombs & if I remember correctly & it was $24.  Don't ask me what the restroom was like. I don't remember it. I'm sure it was gross by the end of the night & I had to wait in line.  This place was a hit. I'm curious to know what it's like here on a regular night.

This place is huge. The staff is awesome. There are some great finds. You have 7 days to return something for full price. My first time looking for books here I didn't find much of what I was looking for. My second time a year later and I snagged almost everything I wanted. I go for paperbacks and try to stay under $11 a book. Older titles are more like $6. Mass market paperbacks are $2-4 usually. My boyfriend ended up with hardcovers from $5-20. The first season of a Tv show I wanted was $15. Earrings are $1. Rings are $6-15 and make for a great prank on your parents making them think you got engaged.  Advice to Bookmans -  Tell your employees checking people out to smile and be friendly. An android probably would have been livelier than the two working the registers. Rings may be in a case so they don't walk off, but if someone wants to look at them just pull out the trays instead of making someone point while you guess wrong over and over.

I don't like coffee. When I go to coffee shops/houses I get tea, specifically chai tea lattes. I'm addicted. I don't want anything else!  I've been here 3 times only because I don't live close enough :( Sad for me, I know.  The first 2 times I was here was early. Like, right after they open early. My friend & I were practically the first people there since it was just after 6am. The guy who greeted us was friendly but subdued & mellow. He kept up a conversation with us & brought our drinks over since, after ordering we sat down on 1 of the huge comfy couches. He even sat down with us for a few minutes before other people wandered in.  The last time I was here was at night. It was MUCH more crowded. I think we got the last spot left in the lot at the moment. The friend of mine who came with me wasn't big on coffee or tea. But he was talked into ordering a "dirty chai" (chai tea with a shot of espresso). He actually liked it. Not my style, but ok :) During this visit I was informed that they'd changed their chai recipe recently & it was a little more "spicy". I don't really know if it was, but I do know that it was GREAT!  Screw Starbucks & their watered down excuse for chai tea lattes. Unlimited has spoiled my taste buds. Oh, & they're a little cheaper than the big chain too! ;)  I can't tell you about their chairs being uncomfortable, or not. I love the couches. I didn't want to leave.  Also, there's tons of natural lighting from all the big windows. Nice! No claustrophobia issues being here.  I think the people working here are very nice. They were personable, friendly, VERY HELPFUL, nonjudgmental, & humorous.

I definitely want to come back!  We came in a group of 4 after First Friday around 9:30 or so. We parked across the street which at first I thought was a little strange but at least we found a spot fast.  The guy at the door was super nice while carding us & liked my checkered vans.  We had to wait about 15-20 min for a table. It was pretty crowded.   We made our way outside to the back bar through a patio filled with tables, chairs, & heaters all over.  There was a DJ type guy doing music which wasn't too bad.  I remember my vodka tonic being stiff. I tasted my friends hoegaarden with a slice of orange & loved it!  I noticed servers can be scarce sometimes.  Food: - Hot Vings traditional style I think. It was a HUGE plus that these automatically come wth blue cheese instead of ranch. Yay! - The Good 'Ol Steak Salad looked good but I didn't try it. My friend said it was pretty good. - The Trifecta looked mouth watering. My friend let me try his fries. OMG! Some of the best fries I've ever had. Thin & crispy on the outside while still being perfect on the inside. I almost want to say they were sweet. Like sweet potato fries? Different but amazing. - Southern Fried Chicken Salad was mine. The chicken was tender & a tiny bit spicy. It comes with a huge hunk of green chile cornbread that had my mouth doing happy back flips.  There's quite a range in the type of people I saw there. My group was pretty casual. We were in jeans, tennis shoes, & I had vans on. There was an older gentleman smoking a cigar, a guy that looked exactly like a younger Chris Isaak, guys in dress shirts or tees, and a lot of girls in heels. Lot of good looking people there that night! I'm gonna say you can go casual but since it's getting close to Scottsdale people do dress up just a bit.  The bathrooms are also nice. I actually barely remember them but I don't remember anything bad.

Came here for a drink & to digest after La Condesa. It was Monday & the sun was just about setting when we arrived. That's the earliest I've been to the Vig.  Park across the street! Don't waste $$ on valet. Ignore the "No Vig parking" signs & park a tiny bit deeper into the lot.  There was no one carding at the door. The hostess was a little scatter brained & didn't always man her post. (I've been a host. I got yelled at if I let customers "linger" coming in because I'd walked away.) She tried to tell us there weren't any tables available. I look over to see plenty of tables empty. Were they reserved? No biggie, I tell her we'll find a seat out on the patio, but not at a table.  I have no problem with my elders but it seemed like a retirement community was having a field trip to the Vig. It's such a different vibe earlier in the day. No wonder people like this place; ANYONE can go here!  The service was a lot better this time. By golly, a smile sure does go a long way! I'm not a wine connoisseur in the least, but our server helped me out & talked me through some flavors. I tried a wine & didn't like it. I just don't like bitter & I don't like white. I know this much. I decided on a drink with hard alcohol.  Meow-meow, the "house cat" came to chill with us. She spent some time grooming & then curled up for a snooze. Awesome! She's a sweet cat.  Only negative this time were the 2 older gentlemen hogging the bocce ball. I expressed interest in playing a game with my date. But no, they played at least 5 or more games while we were sitting there. They were tallying points up so I could tell they'd been playing for a while. That's just rude people. Play 2 games & then get the eff off the turf!

Why did I have such a good time here, again? Was it because I was with the best of company & just couldn't go wrong? Vig sure does make my date nights go well though, I'll say that much.  Friday after 11. I wore black flats, not my checkered vans. The door guy didn't say squat about liking my shoes. So I'm pretty sure he doesn't say that to all the girls. That made me like him even more. I think he genuinely likes my vans.  Hmm not always easy to find a seat. The host is gone & it's "seat yourself".  Made it to the back bar. Got a couple drinks. I was being leered at by 2 guys pushing 60. Uncomfortable, so we moved.  We got a table & 2 different servers asked us if we'd been helped. We moved tables. No server. We sat in some chairs. No server. Meh...  Also, Meow-meow might be preggers. She looked a little on the fat side.

Oh boy, did I get my dance on or what?! I was sore the next day. Good stuff. Good stuff!  People complaining about the crowd or drinks or what all just need to let it go. Who cares?! You're there to have fun. So have fun! Get drunk somewhere else & stumble here if drinks cost so much. Jeez.  There is NO free ladies night on Thur. Uncool :( I'd heard there was. And yes, I'm thinking of Myst, not Axis Retardius.. oops Radius.  There IS a coat check. It's $5  21+ is upstairs. You get a black light stamp on your wrist. It's kind of strange being drunk on the dance floor surrounded by 18 & 19 year olds that are stone cold sober.  I didn't even care what people looked like around me anymore. Although, it is kind of hard not to stare at some girl's ass almost hanging out of her dress when it rides up because she's grinding up on someone.  The place gets packed. Is there something wrong with that? No!  Yeah, sometimes guys just stand around. Whatever... You're there for you, not the loser dude that doesn't know how to move. Maybe he's just struck dumb by your beauty & forgot how to do anything.  There's hookah out on the patio.  I never waited in line for the restroom.  There was a go-go type girl in a bikini shaking her stuff eventually.  The music is a good mix. Hey, I kind of like Lady Gaga.  I'd definitely come back here. But only after I drink somewhere close by ;)

This is always a must visit on First Fridays. There are always interesting pieces here.  It's an open & tall gallery, but they put up partitions to hold more.  The art is even "live" sometimes.

Dear Lost Leaf,  I love you. I know this might seem sudden to you. I'll admit that I did fall hard and fast, but please don't fault me for that. I can't help that I think you're amazing.  Marry me? Put me out of my misery. Stop making me stalk you so much. Yes, I enjoy seeing you so often, but I want to call you mine. It would be spectacular; I promise.  Always yours, Your Lost Lover

Ok, so part of Phoenix has a "train" running through it. Big whoop.  1. The route it runs is actually ok. PASS 2. The hours suck. Can't take the rail to a bar (don't drink & drive!) & be able to take it home. FAIL 3. Why oh why did they not build it elevated?! All the money spent buying land could have been put into an elevated/underground system. FAIL 4. Build a gate/cage with turnstiles! Why would people pay when they can ride for free? If people paid to use the rail it would have been paid off by now & it could have been built better in the first place. FAIL 5. If people had to pay, the city could hire security for each & every train, plus at each stop. As of now it's not that safe to take the rail, especially at night. FAIL  Overall impression: The people who planned this are morons. What were they thinking? Oh wait, they weren't.

I've heard of people living in hotels & I can see how easy that would be here. This is like a small studio apartment. There's a couch, big tv, sliding glass door, & a full kitchen. & I mean full. There's a refrigerator & a dishwasher. This place is nice.  You'll certainly get a good night sleep on the bed too. It's very comfortable. It was one of those foam beds that's supposed to keep you from disturbing the person next to you. I slept without a feather pillow because I'd been having neck & shoulder pain. I woke up feeling better.  The drapes could block out a little bit more light.  The sink is outside of the bathroom area so you can use it if someone is taking a shower or something.  The bathroom door was a little crooked on it's hinges. Not the easiest to close quietly.  When my friend comes back into town I hope he stays here again. He talked about staying another time.

Such a nice hotel. I really do like it here. Read my previous review :)  Door was fine in the room we had.  Bed was just as comfortable as last time. CLEAN! You get a choice between feather or foam pillows. Didn't realize that last time.  One complaint though... Check out is at 12 I believe. So, you want to sleep & stay as long as possible. You put your "Do not disturb" sign out. 10am the maid comes a-knocking. Are you effing kidding me?! You open the door & ask her what she wants. She points to the sign hanging on your door. REALLY?! Can she not read??? Just wow...

I've loved Ulta for years. The Ulta brand is great for the money. I have nail polish, eye shadow, gel eye liner, blush, and tinted lip balm from them and I love it all.  They're good for guys too. My boyfriend has purchased cologne and hair products before.  For beauty needs they'll usually have you covered. I say usually because sometimes they can be low in stock.  Sign up for the rewards program. It's worth it!

3.75   DO NOT PARK WHERE A SIGN TELLS YOU NOT TO PARK!! YOU WILL BE TOWED!!  There are spots in the parking lot with signs that say something like "Military personnel parking only" or some crap like that. If you park there, you will lose your car. It doesn't matter what time it is. Tow trucks come in with their lights off & tow tons of cars away. Can you imagine going to enjoy a show, coming out, & your car is gone?!?!?!  The first time I ever came here the door guy wouldn't let me bring my unopened bottle of water in. I take issue with places in Phoenix that don't let you bring water in. Don't you know what dehydration is?!  I'm over 21, but I still have a vertical ID. I got my wrist band no problem.  It's pretty quiet between bands. I think I heard music once.  It gets HOT! They only run the A/C when the bands aren't playing. Wtf is this nonsense?! Run it when they ARE playing; that's when everyone is moving & hot.  Sound can suck here. You can barely hear or understand the singers sometimes. The sound guy totally made the drums drown out the lead during 1 band. But then again, 1 band was great when it came to sound. They took time to make sure everyone was balanced.  I didn't even bother going into the caution taped off bar area. But it's a pretty big section of the venue. I'm 1 of those people way up close rocking out. It's great up there, even if I do have to tell the 5 foot 13 year old next to me to stop shoving for no reason or she's gonna get an elbow to the face. Hey, it's good to learn venue etiquette early, right?  Yeah, for some reason I kind of like the Clubhouse. Hmm must be because I can pay $10-15 to have a great night...

I've been here 3 times in about the span of a year so I feel fairly familiar with the consistency of this place.  First off, HAPPY HOUR! And then REVERSE HAPPY HOUR! ...Ok, I'm calm. I've only ever been here for a happy hour, so I'm unsure if they always card at the door. They get pretty slammed at times so I totally understand making it easy by putting a wristband on the 21+. This is perfectly acceptable. The host is usually pointing out the special by the door while checking ID's. People need to stop complaining.   The staff is friendly and decently attentive. It's a good place for a date or a group. The food is good. Everything's always been fresh. Their Tootsie, Las Vegas (I always get it without jalapeno), and Dragon rolls are good. Sometimes the Rainbow can be a little dry. I've noticed that the Playgirl can get a little skimpy. I think it comes with avocado and sometimes it hasn't had very much. I think that was the problem. I wish they'd put descriptions of their rolls online. I don't normally do spicy but the Lollipop was good. It's just spicy enough to not be overpowering. Any time I've had the eel nigiri it's been a good texture. Perfectly falls apart in your mouth without being mushy.

Came for the 1/2 off happy hour around 5 on a Fri. My friend had made a reservation for a group of about 8 or so.  I left around 9 I think. By that time it had gotten pretty crowded & then even died down a tad.  Spent some time on the patio which I actually liked.  Also, the music is pretty quiet for a place like that & I noticed a few songs I like.  Drinks: I got a regular house margarita, frozen with salt. It tasted pretty good. Came in a style glass they serve beer in. That was a little strange to me for this kind of place. If I get a margarita I like it in a margarita glass, darn it! :( regularly $6 & 32 oz is $11 Moved on to try The Plata-Pom-A-Rita on the rocks. According to their menu it's "Hornitas Plata shaken w/ Dekuyper Pomegranate & Triple Sec. topped w/ a splash of cran." I almost died of sweetness at first. Phwew! regularly $7 & 32 oz is $13 They have this thing where they make a bunch of noise while 4 people get up on a table or the huge bar to take shots from 4 glasses stuck to a board. I thought I heard it costs about $16. I thought it was stupid though. Whatever...  Service: The girl that served us was pretty ditzy. Poor thing... Girls were taking orders & a few guys would rush out with the food. I noticed a few of the girls looking quite lost sometimes but the guys hustled their butts! I was even almost handed someone else's bill. Say what?! 1 of the guys in the group was drinking a tap beer. Our server came up behind him when he was talking & before we could stop her she swooped it up when he wasn't done with it. That pissed us off. It's not coke. There are no free re-fills!  Food: Someone ordered a cheese crisp looking thing when I was away for a bit. I came back & it looked pretty gross. I didn't even try it. A guy sitting close to us got a pretty good looking burrito though & some other stuff. Don't remember what it was but I remember thinking, "That looks really good!"  Restrooms: The girls restroom had a crap ton of fliers EVERYWHERE! It was ridiculous since most of them ended up underfoot. Kinda slippery & treacherous if you ask me. Also, the girls room is just past the mens. There was a guy sitting propping the mens room door wide open the whole time we were there. Yeah, I accidentally saw a couple dudes pissing. Ick!

All in all I wasn't impressed with this theater.  My best friend (a guy) took me here so we could both see Avatar at the IMAX 3D.  We stroll through the doors laughing & talking while making our way to the counter to buy tickets. Wait, there's no 1 buying tickets & the 2 people behind the counter are turned away doing something else.  We pause in confusion & look around feeling a little lost. Oh, you're supposed to buy tickets from these things on the wall now? Alrighty then, we can do that.  We fiddle with a touch screen machine for a minute or so before we figure out they only take credit cards. WTF?  My friend is frustrated by now & I think was starting to entertain the thought of leaving. I'm not giving up that easily though!  I drag my friend over to the counter & get the attention of the girl there. I explain that he doesn't want to pay with a credit card & would like to pay with cash. She sells us our tickets.  My poor friends' eyes practically bugged out of his head when he heard the price. Was it really over $25 for 2 people to see a movie?! Did I hear that correctly?  Anyway, she hands us these big ugly black glasses while I wonder how people paying with the machines get theirs. I also wet wiped my (uncomfortable) glasses before the movie because I just don't know how AMC disinfects them between people.   Were we really in an IMAX theater? The screen looked about the same as any other.

For being at Metro this is actually a pretty decent hotel. There wasn't much I didn't like.  - It was quiet. - The beds were comfortable & clean. - I'm pretty sure the pillows were feather pillows. They were fluffy. Huge points there. - No residue from the bar soap. - The lotion worked, wasn't sticky, & smelled nice. This is actually a big deal to me. - It was dark. The drapes were great. Only issue was the light from the hallway coming in under/around the door. - I really liked the ledge inside the room under the window. It was big enough to sit on. - There was a mini fridge. - I guess if you pay you can play video games. I saw a controller but didn't really care. - There's free internet. - The sink was outside of the restroom so it's accessible if you're with someone & they're taking a shower etc.

If you are in a restaurant before closing time they should serve you. It's pretty much just good business and customer service. Apparently this place isn't aware of that.  My dining partner and I walked in at 7:54pm yesterday (12/18/13). The door was wide open, all the lights were on, people were inside eating, and the gyro meat was still in the rotisserie in the kitchen. No one was at the counter so we stood around deciding what to eat. Someone working there came in through the front door, so he wasn't even IN the restaurant. He immediately told us they close at 8, which it now was since we had to wait. We were turned away and walked out the door at 8:02.  We went down the street to Philly's and gave them our money since this place didn't seem to want it.

If the food wasn't so darn expensive I'd give 5 stars. So many beers, so little time! We went on a Tue & it wasn't that crowded at all until the hockey game ended. We sat at the bar.  Food: - Grilled artichoke appetizer was $9.75. The chips were great. Loved the dip. But only 1 artichoke head split in 1/2? For over $9 at least put 2 on the plate. - Parmesan crusted chicken was $16.95. They stack 2 pieces of chicken on top garlic mashed potatoes & the whole thing is surrounded by sauce with mushrooms & sun dried tomatoes.  Drinks: - My friend got a red or black velvet. I think it was red. It was fruity & smokey. Not my style but he liked it. About $5. - My other friend got some cherry beer. It was sweet & very cherry flavored. Again, not my style but of course he liked it. About $5. - My friends then got some kind of orange beer with added slices of orange. I really liked this 1. Very tasty. They told me it's from a brewery out in Scottsdale. I remember my friend saying this 1 cost only about $3 - I drank a pomegranate mojito. It was good & there was plenty of mint. Mojitos make me feel like I'm drinking Listerine or gum. If I remember correctly this was over $8. - I also got a margarita. Pretty sour but I always love them like that.   The music was good. Is there really a jukebox? I didn't see 1...  Our bartender, Jason was friendly & helpful. He changed the channel for me when I asked. There are tons of tv's there! I have to say I did feel a little pressured to order a drink right away though. I like to take some time to look at the menu. Please don't jump down my throat & keep asking me to order a drink.  The bathrooms were plenty clean. The faucet on the left didn't want to work though. Even the girl working there who was straightening up admitted it's temperamental. I do like their sink once it works though.  Also, I think it's pretty cool that you can see the chefs working off to the side.  Read in 1 review about wrist bands. We were only carded 1 time & there were no wrist bands.  I really need to come back & try a desert. They sound like they'll be really yummy.

I've never really been a fan of Hanny's. I tried. I wanted to be. Every time I've walked in the door I've felt extreme discomfort. There is a vein of pretentiousness that feels like it's suffocating me. The food and drinks are good though. That's 3.5 stars.  Hanny's cut own beautiful shade trees that they claimed were damaged in a storm. There is no proof of this. Experts and organizations had checked on the trees and determined they were not damaged. Hanny's has previously asked the city to remove the trees and were denied. Something doesn't sit right about their story.  I will not be visiting Hanny's and will emphatically discourage others until new shade trees are replanted. And no, the weed-like plants Hanny's has put in is not good enough. Get it together and get new trees.

Thank you cute-girl-behind-the-counter-taking-orders for not giving me a judgmental look because I'd been out all night & came in still drunkish from St. Patty's. Just, thank you.  I'm such a goof... Me: "Ummm can I get the veggie omelet, but with mushrooms & bacon added?" Girl: *honest laugh* "Sure." *smile* "What kind of bread do you want with that?" Me: "Wheat? Wait, what kinds do you have?" She points to the menu right below me & I lean over to look. "Ohhh! English muffin. Yeah, totally an English muffin." Girl: "Ok." *smile*  It was kind of a smallish omelet for the price. I've had bigger for maybe a $1 less at First Watch. It was still tasty though & they got it right with my strange additions. The side potatoes are ridiculously good too. They're perfectly crispy & tender with rosemary. Fantastic flavor.  Everything comes on white plastic type plates though. Hey, I guess if they get dropped they probably won't break.  I don't drink coffee but I love tea! How many freaking teas do they have?! Everywhere I turned there was tea & more tea. I tried 2 different iced kinds. I want to come back just for the tea.  By the drinks there's everything else you need to season or slather your breakfast with. Grape jelly, strawberry jelly, honey, sugar, hot sauces galore, etc. There's tabasco red & green. I believe the other kind they have is Cholula. I grabbed the chipotle flavor.   There's a pretty big patio with shade. There was a woman eating breakfast with her small dog outside.  Noticed a few clocks telling time in different locations too. Cool thing to have.  The restrooms were busy for some reason. There weren't even that many people at Scramble, but for some reason every chick there just had to be in the restroom at the same time. There are only 2 stalls? I just wanted to wash my hands at the 1 sink & get out of there. I looked around for paper towels. Didn't see any. Noticed a strange grayish air hand dryer. I didn't even bother. I really only wanted something to grab the door handle with.

I love Scramble.  We were the first people there on Easter Sunday. They open at 6 am & we were there at 6:07.  How can that cute girl taking orders be so nice & cheery that early in the morning?! And it was the same girl as last time. She makes my Scramble experiences fun. The other shorter girl working didn't seem as nice.  My gouda brizza was quite tasty. Omg was it hot when I bit in though! I was SO hungry I just wanted to devour it. Yeah, wait a second before trying to chow down, ok?  Could the cinnamon roll have any more frosting? Wow! Luckily, I like them smothered in the stuff. They just pile it on & you spread it around.  I want to describe Scramble as fresh, open, clean, bright, & modern.  The counter girl agrees with me that they need more than just the cherry flavored Capri-Sun. She said the parfaits are good too. I'm going to have to try 1 some time.

Goodyear, if you were an actual person I'd be very tempted to stab you in the eye.  I haven't gotten a new, horizontal ID yet. My 21st b-day was in Oct. It's March. I'm lazy. I was was not allowed to buy alcohol here because of their liquor license. Just crap. Go F yourself...  I guess this is an ok stadium. It seems pretty small though. Parking is wacky. We had to park on the overflow grass.  Anyway, I'm a fan of any stadium with a roof & lots of shade. This place pretty much has neither.

For what it is, this place is awesome. It's tasty, fast, and a super decent price. I'm basing this review off of 4 visits, every time trying something different. I have yet to be disappointed. My boyfriend lives just down the street a bit. We both love this place. It's a staple in our late-night-we're-too-tired-to-cook routine, and it's going to stay there.

Oh, how I do love an unfriendly judgy person who's about to take my order. Sarcasm anyone? Call me crazy but I like to be greeted with a smile. I'm looking at the damn board trying to find the chai tea latte prices. Where the heck is the chai listed?! I deem their chai as bland anyway. Unless their blend changes I'll never go back. Side note: Cool chandelier. But walking through people to order sucks.

Go here! If you don't leave a little bit happier & lighthearted then you're the Grinch incarnate.  I want to come back when I have more time. I didn't realize they were closing in 15 min when we pulled up at 5:45. It was a spur of the moment visit to check out a new place.  I walked in and... "Ohhh" *giggle* "Ahhhh" *sigh* "Look!" *squeal*  I could feel myself reverting back to being 6 or 7 & being overwhelmed by goodies of all kinds. The lunch boxes caught my eye right away. I wish I could go back to grade school & be the kid with the coolest lunch box ever!  I watched a young boy who was about 9 almost frantically decide what he wanted. His mom told him he could get 1 thing. Man, the look on his face! There's just SOOO much to choose from. Poor kid lol  My friend & I checked out the photobooth pics on the wall. Funny! I wanted to do the photobooth but my friend didn't :( I'm the adventurous one.  Some of their prices are ridiculously cheap. 5 cents here, 25 cents there... Other things I thought, "I wouldn't pay $2.50 for a candy bar I can get anywhere."  I bought a sour green apple & a peppermint stick. 50 cents each! nom nom nom  My friend found a pin button he liked. Those are $1.  Great little place. Just by the outside you feel like you're going to walk into Candyland come to life. Makes me think this is the PG version of Easley's with tons of new school & old school candy.

4.5 because the food is so good. Lacking a half star because the service isn't that great (but you don't go for that) and I've noticed the lemongrass chicken can vary in size between visits. The chicken pho is always top notch. I ask for shrimp spring rolls without the pork and I always get what I want with no issues.  Here's a little guide to Pho Thanh: - There's also parking in the back. - You can seat yourself or wait until you catch the eye of someone working there and they'll air traffic controller style point/wave you to a table. - There are always people eating who work there. Don't be surprised if one of them gets up to take your order before going back to their meal. - Don't expect staff to stand around and chit chat with you. It's probably not going to happen. They act like they're there to feed you and clean up after you and that's it. I should have warned my grandmother and mother to not expect the warm fuzzies when we came here for a family dinner. - Feel free to ask questions or ask for something you need. They are helpful. - DO NOT play with the chopsticks. Seriously. Don't. Would you go somewhere else and play with the silverware? If the answer is yes you need to go back to the cave you came from and learn some manners. The exception to this is if you're in Denny's at 3am. We know you aren't sober. Just don't do anything to get arrested. But really, the table is not your imaginary drum set. You are not a walrus. If you want to play "swords" with chopsticks I can help you with that and stab you with one. Parents, please teach your children respect for other cultures, even if this isn't fine dining. - Take food home with you. By the counter there's a rack with containers. Grab what you need. Yes, I know it's customary to eat the noodles right away, but whatever. I'd rather people stop wasting food. It tastes just as good when you're hungry again in a few hours. Their pho is huge. Don't stuff yourself. Get two meals by taking half home. - You pay at the counter. Tell them your table number. If you decide to move tables just make sure you're paying the right ticket. - Never been in an Asian market? There's one right next door. Go get some Pocky. It's only a dollar.

Yep, I'm a fan. In fact, I'm such a fan that I made it here twice in one week. I came back the second time before I'd had a chance to review my first visit.  This place is like therapy for me. It just feels wrong to sweep your peanut shells onto the ground. It's quite liberating. I don't normally go to places that "crunch" when you walk around. The peanuts are free & are in little buckets on the tables & bar.  There are tv's everywhere! They're usually playing sports.  I haven't been out on the patio yet. I'm not a smoker. From what I've seen it looks like a nice patio.  -- First time I was here was on a Mon. The place was pretty dead, except for the bar. Can be kind of hard to get seats at the bar because of how small it is.  Tim was working & Autumn was training. Very nice people. Tim's quite the comedian at times. He's good at his job. I asked for a drink recommendation. He asked what flavors I like. I told him I like fruity but not overly sweet. He recommended a drink to me that was very similar to what I've ordered before. His was great though. He had me pegged, spot on.  Only thing that was bummer is MGD is NOT a drink special on Mon. That's a misprint :(  -- The second time was very different. Came in on Fri around 8-9ish. Got a booth & ordered food.  I had the Seafood Pasta which was a special for $12.99 if I remember correctly. Olive Garden has a dish that's similar (& usually better). It wasn't humongous. I managed to finish it all & not feel stuffed. The seafood part was delicious. The shrimp, mussels, clams were all tasty. There was one clam that didn't open. Why was it put on my plate? The sauce was lacking though. It was some kind of oily white wine sauce. Could have used more of it on my plate. It just needed more oomph to it. Still not a bad dish, but I've had better. Their strawberry lemonade wasn't too bad. A little watered down though.  There was live music. Fun :) The first band was good. They had a mandolin. Insta-points! They played a Bravery cover & did a good job. More points! The second bad (oops, I accidentally typed "bad". Freudian slip?) was meh. Too loud. Too older-gentlemen-trying-to-hold-onto-their-youth-by-being-in-a-garage-band. We left.  Last notes... Our server was really nice. She joked around with us a little. I liked her :) Also, the bathrooms are always pretty nice.

OMG. HELL-the-f*ck-O!  Culver's, I sure am glad you came to the valley. I read about you in the paper. Guess what? I want to eat you!!!  So, I unfortunately have not eaten any real food here yet. But I'm sure planning on coming back for some!  I saw the sign about their strawberry mango smoothies. There is a reason these puppies come with a spoon. I don't care how good you are ladies, there is almost no way in hell you're gonna suck hard enough to get at it. They start out THAT thick! They have real fruit chunks in them too. But not too chunky. It's pretty blended, but you can tell actual fruit went in. It was a little too sweet at times but still ridiculously tasty. I think I liked the mango bit more than the strawberry.

I'll really only come back for the Speak Easy Lounge upstairs in the back. I think Bluewater is overpriced, especially the sushi. $7-12 a roll.  Came on a Thur about 1/2 an hour before closing. Had 2 drinks downstairs before the back opened @ 10. Don't order hard alcohol downstairs. Whomever was making drinks skimps on the liquor. They have beer on tap downstairs but was told there are bottles upstairs. They do bring you a glass for your beer.  Everyone that works there we talked to was extremely friendly & attentive! Managers actually shook my hand & asked my name.  Ok, so upstairs... The Lounge has become one of my fave places in the valley. The decor is SOOO mellow. There are tables & chairs, couches, or the bar of course. They keep the lights down LOW with tons of white candles lit all over. It's very intimate. There's an outdoor patio w/ glass tables & big chairs for smokers. Was told they're debating putting porch swings in the indoor patio area. Right now there are tables & chairs & lots of candles along the windows.  The drinks were finally stiff & very tasty! A lot of people order Moscow Mules. They do have a full bar. There were 2 cute bartenders & 1 pretty waitress. Again, they weren't very busy. Maybe 40-45 people at the busiest.  There's LIVE music. We were listening to a guy sing & a girl play the cello. Before the live music the bartender had some great music playing. I recognized Tegan & Sara, Metric, etc... My only complaint is the music was too loud. It didn't jive with the setting. 1 of the bartenders kept messing with the volume & you could tell they've previously blown out the speakers already. I shouldn't have to yell to be heard.  I was told there was a unisex bathroom & instantly cringed. My concern was unfounded though. The bathroom was perfectly fine throughout the night. It's actually very nice. Turn the lock & it'll tell others it's "occupied". The door is HEAVY though. Shove on it.  So, how do you get to the Speak Easy? Pull around to the back. There'll be an unmarked door on the left. It's up a few stairs. There might be a guy working there who stands in front of the door. I hear he's the 1 that cards (I wouldn't know. Came up through the downstairs since my friend knew someone working there). You'll walk into a kitchen. There are stairs to the right or an elevator to the left. Stairs are fine for when you arrive, but they're a little dark. Be careful! If you've been drinking, take the elevator when you leave. Trust me!

I am unimpressed. This is not a welcoming coffee house. There is nothing cozy here.  I am on a constant hunt for good chai. I didn't find it here. I know the company Cartel orders their mixes from makes a spicier chai. Based on other reviews it's either not ordered anymore or was ordered by accident before. The chai was pretty much all latte and hardly any chai.  They will pretty much assume any drink you order is to go. Not surprising because who would want to sit around on the ridiculously uncomfortable chair things? They are literally concrete blocks with bent metal for a back and a thin pad for the seat. Steal a pad or two from other chairs and don't try to lean back. Ouch ouch ouch.

Yes! Yes!! YES!!  I got to go here & I'm going to be telling everyone I know that they're missing out if they don't try the Dogfish Shark Taco.  I actually took a first date here. Major points for me from my date. He luuurved it.  I'm salivating thinking about the happy-mouth-gasm I had.  This place is hard to find :( Drove right past it twice! I was hell bent on getting here though. They need a sign out front, not just the name on the building.  I wasn't sure which direction the restroom door opened either. It opens on the right. If there's no one in there it'll open. (duh lol)  Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco was good. Not really my style though. It was tasty & looked good. Maybe I just don't like mole?  Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco is melt in your mouth good. You lightly crunch through the batter & the tender dogfish practically, no perfectly, falls apart in your mouth. I'm addicted.  The Shrimp Quesa is... gosh, where do I even start? The outside was fluffy, while still being robust. The shrimp were cooked, & chopped perfectly; tender & never chewy! I loved how the garlic was sliced & not minced or ground. It's amazing how a little thing like sliced garlic makes a huge difference in flavor balance.  I thought I'd had some darn good horchata before. This is horchata on steroids. I mean that in the best way. This may be weird, but next time I go I'm going to ask for no ice so I can eat the pecans & some of the fruit with a spoon. Don't think badly of me, I just want every last tasty bit!  The salsa bar is so fun! The salsa bar with something crazy like over 11 salsas?! Yeah, THAT salsa bar. I've never even heard of some of those salsas. I took 1 of each home. I wanted something to use to convince my mom to come here eventually. I also get to keep enjoying La Condesa from home by using their salsas on burritos, tamales, & quesadillas I make.  Who cares if they don't always understand what you say? Who cares if sometimes they don't get every order right? That's fixable! Just talk it out with them. But really, it's about the food. It's all about the food...  Edit: I noticed a difference between the online menu & the physical menu at the location.  Online: Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Shark Taco Actual: Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken Taco - A Oaxacan specialty! A legendary blend of spices, chiles, nuts and chocolate made into a rich and flavorful sauce, mixed with shredded chicken. This comes topped with red onions & there is no shark in it, just chicken.

I've been here about 4 times now. I love this place. The name has changed, they've been serving alcohol for a while now, there's a new location in Glendale (I need to go), and the menu has expanded but isn't quite represented online yet. Even the physical menus can be different. The one I had had a few more items on it than my friends'. The horchata is still the best I've ever had. The margaritas are so freaking good.  I tried the marlin taco that wasn't there last time I visited. I love trying things I've never had before. Marlin is an odd fish. Their preparation makes it look and taste almost like pork. It's just... different. Still good though!  My friend got the veggie burro. She said it was pretty tasty, but a little on the bland side. We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times. She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.  They get slammed on weekends. I was here at 7pm on a Friday. They need more than 2 people serving and clearing on weekends. When every table is packed there's almost no room to move. Getting to the salsa bar can be pretty awkward.

Any fast food place can be hit or miss. I love the Charbroiled Santa Fe Chicken sandwiches. But I know to ask for an extra chile. If I didn't, I'd get a tiny chile strip which would cover 3 bites. Gotta know how to work the system.

I've been here twice.  The first time I was here I was unable to return a pair of Ray Bans. They don't carry the style I have. They were sent to me as a gift & I just want a different color. They still have the tags on them & are still in the box. They've been held 2 times. They're obviously genuine, I just don't have a receipt. What do they not understand about them being a gift? I'm sorry the person gifting them to me didn't get a gift receipt, but come on now... I'd expect a place where you have to pay $140 for a pair of sunglasses to be more accommodating. At least the girl wasn't mean about it.  The second time I was here I was just browsing. I had a girl ask me, "Can I help you with anything?" I'd barely heard her. I turned around & stopped to look at her. She had on her purse... I ask, "Do you work here?" Her response was, "No, but I'd like to." Umm ok... *nervous smile* *edge away* That was a bit different. Never had that happen to me before.

This store used to be on the North East side of Metro. There's a sign on the old building saying they've moved "down the street". What exactly does that mean?  We luckily kept driving around Metro & spotted the new location. It's now on the North West side.  My friend only needed a charger for his phone. That's it.  We walk in & there's a girl standing in front telling people she can help them. Misleading! People start telling her what problem they may be having & they totally expect help right then & there. No, she just wants your name & phone #. What for? We got some bs about someone else calling you up to help you. We walked over to the accessories, picked what we needed, & checked out. It felt like they just wanted to keep track of who was coming in.  Actually, I could feel consumerism & corporate America practically choking me to death. I about had a panic attack in this store for some reason. I had to leave while my friend checked out. This place was NOT good for me.

"The Underground opened on Feb. 19, 2010. The club has a capacity of 250 to 300 people, and specializes in punk, hardcore, and rock acts." http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/venues/The_Underground_797650545832  I really like this venue. So, why 4 stars? It's so darn hard to find! I'm not even sure how to get in from the front. I drove right past it without seeing a sign. I got lucky & turned into the alley off MacDonald. Google map location: http://bit.ly/9l5ofZ  You have to go down the stairs to the "Underground".  I think the floor has been epoxied a whitish color.  There are a couple tagging style murals on the walls. They're interesting but I have no clue what they actually say though.  The stage is a carpeted step up from the crowd. It's not huge or anything, but it's big enough for some jumping around. Seems about the average size for a small venue like this.  The sound was GREAT! You could actually understand what the singers were saying, even if you didn't know the band. I'm a huge fan of this place because of the good sound. That's the whole point of a music venue. Good music!  If you live on the East side of the Valley then this is a pretty neat little venue to check out :)

Damn, those bartenders are HOT!  I'd rather come here than a strip club. The chicks are hotter (fitter) & I don't have to watch anyone get naked. I like that wide eyed innocent cowgirl look. These girls aren't haggard or look like they've just seen too much.  Too bad this bar's in Tempe. Guys will chat you up & ask for your # but won't buy you a drink. Douchebaggery!  Oh, & if you stand up off your stool to pick something up some bleach blonde bimbo bitch in heels might try to steal it literally out from under you. I'm not talking about how you walked away from your stool & then someone else fairly claimed it. I mean you're still leaning over it about to sit back down. Gotta love those spoiled snobs that think they're entitled!

I won't be back here.  Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.  We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?  I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.  I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.  It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix

I was pretty faded by the time we made it over here. But I'll try to review what I remember. Me, & 2 of my friends were here on a Tue around midnight. Not too crowded but still a decent turn out.  We walked in & 1 of the cute male bartenders was doing tricks with a couple vodka bottles. He was even breathing fire.  I didn't ride the bull. I didn't feel like upchucking that night. But it was kind of fun to watch others & cheer on strangers.  There's karaoke. I know this because my friend actually managed to get me to sing a song. I must have been really fing drunk.  Ok, so why 2 stars? Because 1 of the bartenders took our vodka tonics away before we were even 1/2 way done with them. So what that we're drunk. So what that we turn around & watch people on the bull. So what that we don't hover over our drinks. Until that damn glass is empty don't touch my drink bitches.

I am so torn between 2 & 3 stars. This new "Vig" just... wasn't. It just wasn't the Vig I'm coming to know & love.  We showed up around 12 or so on April First Friday.  Parking is a disaster here too. Hello Shasta. Lots of people park anywhere else BUT the Vig lot. At least you don't have to park across the street, just next door.  The door guy does not really check ID's. He just looked at us & waved us in.  The architecture is cool. It's open & the ceiling is tall. It's not as cramped. Lots of gray, concrete, rust colored metal, & some wooden accents. So, the inside is ok. Better than the other Vig.  Put up a clear, easy to read sign pointing to where the restrooms are! Do it NOW. Everyone wants to walk back to where the kitchen is. Nope, restrooms are right where the patio starts in the back on the left.  The patio sucks. It's more like an extension of the inside. Not as lounge-like as the other Vig. It's closed in with tons of glass & block. It's freaking LOUD out there. Everything reverberates. Not good. Only awesome thing is the fireplace. More people can sit around it & it's really cool looking.  The servers pay attention to you here! Are there more of them at this location? I saw our server tons of times & she checked on us at least 5 times, maybe more. That's great!  I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. I didn't know you could mess 1 of those up. The bread is HUGE & fluffy. I could barely taste the cheese past all that bread. Saving part about that meal are their fries.  - Moscow Mule was yum :) - Glass of Next: Pinot Nior was very good. - Trout Slayer on tap! My friend has property in Missoula Montana & was a little surprised it was on tap here. This was my first time trying it. I don't normally like beer. I'm picky with beer. This stuff is GOOD! Who knew I'd like a beer with a fishy fruity flavor lol. - Tic Tac the bartender gave me when I asked for a recommendation was gross. 1. No one orders those. 2. That wasn't made correctly. Thankfully he didn't charge us since I hated it.  The people who were there are a lot more casual. Older crowd too. Not nearly as attractive as the people at the other Vig. Sorry, but it's true. I watched 1 woman who was so drunk she nodded off in her chair.  DJ is a girl, and she's not bad.

It's been a year since I was here? It's really been that long? Sadly, I'm keeping my rating the same. A whole year & it's still not vibing with me well.  Ended up here on a Wednesday around 11pm.  We couldn't order food. Nothing. Zip. Nada. The kitchen was closed. It's only 11 & we came over here because The Vigs have great late night food. Lame The bar had people at it so we cozied up by the fire. Romantic. The server was really nice. The music mix was great. Music is a big deal for me. The drinks were watered down. BAD BAD BAD! Why would a bartender serve cocktails in a pint glass & water them down?! Yuck!  Both times I've been here they can't get the drinks right. I might never go back for drinks.

I don't like coffee. Wait, then why the hell am I reviewing a coffeehouse?! Oh right, because they have smashing good crepes and they're open late. You get a star just for having late night food!  It's hard for me to rate JoBot without mentioning Lost Leaf next door. Only reason I ended up in JoBot is because it stays open until 12am. It's a saving grace for drunk hipsters. Be prepared for a shock of bright lights compared to Lost though if you stumble next door.  I have one complaint though. Am I the only person who thinks it's hard to get late night service?! I've sat at the counter staring at the person behind it without being asked if I'd like anything. Is it my job to track down someone to take my order so they can make money? This is new to me. I'm quite confused by this behavior as it's happened more than once.  Tip: Take a JoBot business card sitting on the counter. There's a 10th JoBot Free promotion on it.

This is going to be a simple update. I still love the crepes so I'm keeping my rating the same. Finally tried their chai though. They make them with honey so it really changes the taste. Makes them way sweeter than spicy. Trying that once was enough. I want spicy.

It took me a year and a half to make it back to Curry Corner. Things really changed! The menu is still the same, but the entire decor is much nicer. This is definitely a restaurant I'd recommend to people. I hate that I happen to live in West Phoenix and don't get to come here very often as it's rather affordable.  Hosts/servers could use a little more training. It's customary to check in on someone a little after they've gotten their food. You want to make sure people's drinks are never empty.

General thoughts and conversations throughout the night: Where do we park? How do we get in? I don't see any signs pointing to the entrance. Can we use this gate? Nope, that doesn't open. Why is the entrance only in the back? Is this hostess going to help us find our party of 14? No? Ok, we'll just wander and find them. Am I really still in central Phoenix? Did Scottsdale invade? This is such a bad idea for the summer. Where's our waitress? This food is so not worth the price. Is there even fish under all this batter? Oh, there it is... I think. Where's our waitress? Why is no one clearing this table? There's no more room to even set glasses. Has anyone seen our waitress? Could this bathroom be any more confusing for people? Is it unisex? Is it not? Decide! That mystery alcohol grab thing was such a waste of money. Ew. I'm tired of waiting an hour to play a game. Let's leave and never come back.

This is soooo much closer to where I live than the original location. Awesome :) I'll be back. The only kink is service and signage. The people are new and are being trained so that should improve. I swear one of the servers also works/worked at the original. This location is just as hard to spot though. Small building, but plenty of parking in back.  I'm a huge fan of the original. Been there multiple times. I was much more impressed by the mole being served here, but not so much the dogfish. It was still good, but seemed to be more batter this time around. Cabo shrimp and marlin are good at both locals. Two taco plates with rice and beans and two horchatas = $25-30  I finally have enough experience with these restaurants to complain just a little bit. 1. Go back to putting the rice and beans in cups or bowls please. I am begging you! I'm so tired of my tacos getting soggy from my beans spreading across my entire plate. Get plates with ridges and sections or something. Something! Anything! 2. The music IS REALLY LOUD at both locations. I'd like to not have to yell at my dining partners. 3. No pecans in the horchata anymore? Did I miss this menu change or was it just a hiccup at the newbie?
