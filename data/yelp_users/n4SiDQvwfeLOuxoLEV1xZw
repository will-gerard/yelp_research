Quite possibly the worst service in the entire town of Mesa. Our server was young with braces and the one of the most air headed persons I've ever met. After confirming that I wanted my eggs sunny side up 2 different times she still brought them out scrambled like I wouldn't notice. The food also took 40+ minutes to get out of the kitchen. I'll never be back. Fudge this place.

Delivered by Anthony in a super timely fashion I must say! We ordered a small pepperoni pie and a large Cesar salad! Had the pie cooked well done and double cut. Gotta have that crispy crust!!! The salad was actually very good size and the dressing was good. Shaved parm and a hefty amount of croutons. Our delivery driver, Anthony, was very happy and had a smile on his face when we opened up the heated carrier. Friendly and warm he also sprinted back to his car to get the shredded parm and hot peppers. Good dude!!! Will order again soon

Bombbb spot for the happy hour. Gotta go with the bama roll and spicy tuna roll as far as sushi goes. Also the chicken+shrimp lettuce wraps. The cucumber and seaweed salad and sauce that it comes with is on point!!!!! Their drinks specials are also great. I'll be back for sure

Great job! Had two very nice ladies come and clean our crib for a couple hours. They sure got in the nitty gritty of things. Most impressed by how clean they got the bathroom. Even behind the toilet was super clean! They got the top to bottom everywhere we directed them. Great job!

Went in there to redeem my coupons for the BOGO free smoothie. When I asked the worker whats all in strawberry banana smoothie his response was a simple "uhh strawberries and bananas dude." Everyone who works in here is your typical gym rat and will give you the stink eye if you don't lift as much as them. Poor customer service, decent at best smoothies.

Another bad case of poor door managers. Nathanael is a b* and doesn't know what's up. Other than this little door man complaint the Irish car bombs are 2 legit 2 quit

The guy Gordon that works here is the man!!!! He's so funny and very helpful. Knows everything there is about sandwiches. He's also got a great sense of humor and even told us about the secret menu. There's "The Truth" and the monsoon. Both ridiculously delicious. A must go but only open till 2:30!!!!

Went here for the first time ever on Saturday for the brunch. We had a reservation and were seated immediately in the outside grotto area by the hostess. We started out with the cheese plate appetizer and wow it was soooo good!!! I'd recommend it to anyone who loves some tasty cheeses accompanied by fresh fruit and different types of crackers. For our main meal we went with the chicken sandwich and my girlfriend had the salmon salad. Both of these dishes were extremely tasty with so many unique flavors with every bite. I would go back here in anytime!

What a great Sunday brunch spot. Right away we knew we wanted to sit outside on the patio. We put our name into the hostess and she told us it was 45 minutes for first available. Sat down outside and got a Bloody Mary and sangria at the bar. The time didn't go by too slow and before we knew it we got a text letting us know the table was ready. To start we had the chips and guac. FIRE stuff right there. We also asked for lemons with our waters 3 different times and they never came. Food was great and came out the kitchen quickly. Had the eggs Benedict and hotcakes. WOW. Delicious.

This place is bomb!! Been to a few other restaurants around the California area but this Scottsdale location is in the perfect spot. So close to my house and I can go get some good food when I'm finished shopping. Went there a couple weeks ago now and was immediately greeted at the door by the host and was seated right away. Matt was our server and recommenced the chicken nachos and also the fresh fish of the day which was the swordfish. My gf and i actually never had them and were quite impressed!! This place is the real deal.

This is the worst place on mill ave. We decided to purchase 2 tables for my roommates graduation party and for some reason one of the dweeb bouncers kicked out the graduate for "pushing him". My roommate was respectful when the bouncer asked him to get off the stage immediately and his response was to remove him from the bar. I was standing directly behind it when the ordeal happened and that was not the real story. The bouncer lied to the head bouncer and had the entire party removed.   Also, the TV monitor's picture that is airing the stage has the worst quality picture I've ever seen. Might as well throw a black and white TV on the wall.   What kind of establishment removes a group of 20+ people for their employees' feelings getting hurt? We brought business to them and now We will NEVER be back. The place is hurting for business trying to charge a $2 cover fee? Jon Taffer needs to get in here ASAP. Big Bang? More like bitch bang.

Waited about 10-15 minutes for a haircut. Not too bad of a wait time. Went by fast with all the magazines they have. Don't know what my haircut style is called so it's nice to know my name and specific haircut info is in their system. Jong is a very timely stylist as well and also professional. They do great work every time. I'll be back without question!!!

Best deal here you may ask yourself? The carne asada burrito special place. Inside this deliciously wrapped tortilla shell is the carne asada steak, pico, and guac. Absolutely heaven with every bite accompanied by their green or red hot sauce. Sides that come on the plate also include Mexican rice and refried beans. Both spectacular and delicious!!!!!! Ask for limes too when ordering. Fair prices all around

Love the butterburgers and cheese curds here!! A must go for a good burger and very decently priced. Always made to order so you know its fresh. The bacon is cooked to perfection and makes a nice crunch. Just how I like it!! Had to sub the curds for the fries, but that's not a problem with a cheese loving kid like myself!!! Will be back for sure.

Had to grab me one of those golden bear lemonade with mango az iced tea. However it's not 99 cents which is super lame.. Also had the 4 peaks beer sausage with sauerkraut and onions. It was tossed on the grill and came out  delicious. Definitely will be back!! 4 stars for not having standard 99 cent az iced teas all around

Best prizza! All the toppings are delicious I've had the pineapple and Canadian bacon pizza and the sausage and onion pizza. Also the special wings are on point OMG.  I'd suggest getting the pizza well done, it's a lot tastier and the crust is a good crunch.

Little hole in the wall type place. Absolutely delicious fish tacos. My only other complaint is that the Mexican rice was a little weak. Other than that gotta check it out. My coworkers had a burrito and said it was awesome!!!!

Food is very very bold here with lots of distinct flavors. Was recommended by the dudes behind the counter to go with the bowl. Comes with rice, 1 meat, 1 veggie, 1 salad and as many fix-in toppings your heart desires. Cucumbers, feta cheese, pickled radishes, and tzatziki sauce. On the side was warm pita bread. Also took advantage of the yelp check in for a free tea.   The only thing that bothered me was the temperature inside of the restaurant. It was so warm that I felt like I had just entered a sauna. We had no choose but to order to-go.

Decent food at best but fair on price. The server we had who took our order was absolutely awful. Didn't get his name but he was a grown African American adult who was acting like a child when I was trying to place my order. Also left his command station to hit on a girl and try to get her number as he watched the line pile up. Won't be back anytime soon that's for sure.

Great chicken at this location. The spicy chicken sandwich is awesome and so are the nuggets. All of the sauces are also delicious and accommodate the chicken very well. My personal favorites have got to be the Polynesian and buffalo. Also the buttermilk ranch is on point. Enjoy your next visit with a refreshing lemonade. God bless
