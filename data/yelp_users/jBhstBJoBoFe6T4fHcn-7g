It is a library.  It is also a kid friendly library where a 3 year old can just as soon build blocks as read books or surf the web.    Friendly staff who allowed my daughter to explore and feed her curious nature.

Value.  Prices are very reasonable. Staff was friendly, food was better than I expected - fish and chips were good! I will definitely be making this part of my rounds.  Why not 5 stars?  Those are rare and special so 4 happily given stars should be worth a peek.

I love burgers. Now I am not saying this is the BEST burger ever, but I am saying it is 5 stars worth of goodness - on just the burger alone.    I got the double meat double cheese with everything on it, lettuce, caramelized onions, tomato, pickles, with a bit o' mayo.  Fries were on the side and a can of soda.  All this for 6 bucks.    No big deal.    Until the food came.    The food quality is wonderful.  It is amazing for the price.  They used to be under different management but are now run by the son of the original owners.    Well done Brandon, nice place, great food.    The hamburger bun....was what you wish for on a burger but did not know it.  Soft bread full of flavor and thick enough to stand toe to to with the beautifully laid out burger inside.    In the end it was a bit of a sloppy eat, the sauce went perfectly with the tomatoes on my burger.  I mean that.    I had fries left over I wish I could have finished...maybe next time.  There will definitely be a next time.  You should swing by for a first time if you have yet to do so. These places are all run by different owners so similarly named joints are not the same, I had a bad experience  at another location.  This is not that location.    Come here because...., you will be happy with the food, happy with the price and back for more.    All I had was the burger and fries with an apple soda.  I left very happy.  (I have eaten a ton of burgers but I have not written many reviews about them, this alone says something.)

Ordered:   the SaBai fried rice;  Nothing special.  You could do much better at so many other places with fried rice.  This applies to everything we ate, the seasoning was way off,  lacked salt and flavor.      The satay Again nothing special with this dish.  It was okay, the peanut sauce was the best part of the dish   And the mussalman curry This was just bad,, off, not good.  I had it with beef, would not order this again.  The only way to describe the problem with the flavor was it was unsalted and somewhat watery.    Taking this place off my restaurant rotation.

My wife and I went to Postinos and were given a flyer promoting this place.  A few days later we were going to go out for gelato when we decided to try something different instead and drove over to Churn.    The parking situation was a hot mess with valet or parking down a residential street being the only two options.  I am sure the neighbors are not impressed with the ramshackle of cars cruising up and down their street looking for a parking space.  We were one of many looking for a spot.  My wife convinced me this was worth the effort so I continued to look for parking.    After a few tries we parked down the street and made our way inside. The place is tiny, with an old style ice cream shop look but no "feel".  The place is kinda sterile, but from the reviews others find it charmimg.  Not sure why, the place is landlord white with glass candy jars filled with candy.  Someone compared it to Farrell's but I would have to completely disagree.  This place lacks the utter feeling of immersion of someplace grand, different, exciting that I remember when I walked into a Farrell's.  This was more like blank ice cream shop with candy jars on display.  Also if you get cold easily then bring a sweater, my wife was chilled after waiting in line for 15 minutes to get served.    The service was friendly, my wife ordered chocolate with salted caramel topping.  The salted caramel topping was waaaay to salty for my taste.  It tasted like caramel for a second, then you were hit with nothing but pure salt taste - like licking a slab of salt - literally.  This ruined both the chocolate and the caramel.  Her scoop was just plain awful and had that been the extent of our experience I would have given the place 1 star.  Seriously, it was that bad.     I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and Madagascar vanilla 2 scoop in a cup with no toppings.  They were both good, although nothing special.  The two stars is based purely on the two scoops I ordered.  Also I did have a bit of the ice crystal problem in my two scoops.  I am not a big fan of ice crystals in my ice cream.  It reminds me of the old box of 1.00 bargain ice cream one forgot was in the freezer but eaten anyway to cure that sweet tooth six months later.    I will also say my wife's one scoop was as big a serving as my two scoops.  I was not a happy camper.     Over-all Churn is ok, nothing less-nothing more.  My wife's ice cream was a disaster of flavors.  Mine was small and good but nothing out of the ordinary.  2 solid stars.  (See the potential 1 star review above)   In all fairness my wife would have given this place 3 solid stars based on my two scoops.

Yes! AAAAAAAaaaaaaaand yes!   EVERYTHING WAS BBQ HEAVEN!   I am from Texas and love beef bbq. I admit I am a bit of a beef bbq snob.  This is great, amazing, I LOVED it all!  Seriously, worth the wait in 120 degree heat.
