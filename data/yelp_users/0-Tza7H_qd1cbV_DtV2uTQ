I have been bringing my daughter here for the past 7 years, her doctor is Dr Scott Cannon, and he is truly an amazing pediatrician! I feel very lucky to have a doctor we can trust. In the past 7 years we have met the other to Dr's and they were fabulous as well. This pediatrician's office is top notch!!!

As a real estate agent I have referred West Coast Plumbing and Air on several occasions and they have always gone the extra mile to provide my clients with honest and fair pricing. The technicians are always respectable and very knowledgable. I will continue to recommend them to all of my clients and of course I will continue to use them for all of my own personal repairs and maintenance. Call WCPA you won't be disappointed!!

I went to Tasty Joe's for the first time today, and this will be my last trip.  We were there after the lunch rush and there were 5-6 dirty tables left over from lunch, but we were the only people in the restaurant. The food portions were good, but I felt the prices were too high given the quality of the food. They also used too much oil, as my broccoli tasted like old grease.  I also agree with previous reviews stating the place has an overwhelming stench of wok oil. Overall it was just disappointing.

Every time I come to this location the service is terrible even though they assign two waiters per table.  The food is pretty good but I sure wish they would figure out how to train/hire good wait staff.

This is a great location! Always clean! The front staff is always welcoming, and even know you by name! I have yet to have a bad instructor/coach. They are always super upbeat and motivating!! I love how varied the classes are! You never know what kind of workout you will be doing until you get there. Each instructor seems to have their choice in music but always keep it varied as well! You will never get sick of the workouts here because each day it is something new! Thanks OTF-Scottsdale Ranch for always bringing an intense but amazing workout!!
