If you like zero customer service and an untrained staff then hurry on in. This is the place for you!

Service is wonderful. The biggest surprise has been how fast the food comes out while still being fresh and full of flavor every time.

Ambiance is a bit sterile and simple. Service was excellent however and there was a good view of all the TVs regardless of where you sat. The pizza exceeded my expectations so overall not a bad casual hangout.

Best Indian food in Phoenix. Period. Also you won't find nicer owners that treat you like family.

Had to ask several times for refills, presentation was below par and most importantly the flavors were average. Overpriced and under delivered.

It is rare when you find a place where the service is as good as the food. In particular, the wings are hands down the best in Phoenix!

If you don't like friendly service, the nicest patrons and great food and drinks then this place is not for you.
