This place does not try to reinvent the Burger & Fry Diner or do anything new and exciting but they do a good job sticking to the classics.    I went for a late lunch on a Thursday so it was slow when I was there.  I loved the 50's diner look of the place.  Everything from the tile to the art to the booths was very nostalgic (says the 25-year-old).  I ordered the cowboy burger and onions rings with an Oreo cheesecake shake.  I sat a the booth where I could watch my burger get set on grill and my onion rings dropped in the oil.  Made to order is no joke there.  The food was very good.  The burger wasn't anything fancy or new but it was a good, and fresh.  The onion rings were straight-up dope.  I highly recommend the fry sauce to go with fries or onion rings.  It has just the right amount of kick.  the shake was insanely good.  If I'm downtown and looking for a burger again, this is definitely where I'll be going.

This place is perfect.  First and foremost, the food is delicious.  I've tried 5 different kinds of tortas, and they've all been amazing.  My favorite so far is the Alahmbre with carne asada.  Their pastor is also amazing.    They do NOT skimp on the avocado, which I appreciate.  The fries are just ok, but honestly, it doesn't matter.  They have a salsa bar which has some pretty good salsa.  The green one was my favorite.  The staff is INCREDIBLY nice.  They're also super helpful, patient, and seem to genuinely want you to enjoy your time there.

This place is my JAM!!    This is place is so different from anything else.  Sure, they make enchiladas and tacos but it's a whole different style than anything else I've ever had.  I like the salad or enchiladas.  I personally prefer short rib with cornbread filling because it gives it a tamale taste.  I know that sounds weird to get cornbread in a salad or enchilada but trust me, I'd eat my weight in that stuff.  It's super moist and extra spicy.    Everything is very fresh (including the handmade guacamole.  YES PLEASE!)  The staff is fast and are quick to make whatever changed you want to your meal.  You can sample all the meats before you order (and again, try the cornbread).  The owner is a great guy and I hope they build new locations soon.    The sitting area and parking get absolutely crazy during lunchtime, especially as word spreads of how good this place is, so be prepared to park somewhere else or try to hit it up later in the day.

This place is a hotspot for hipsters.  I went there a year ago on a date because she was a big fan of Mexican food, as am I.  She ordered a burrito and I got three tacos: 2 fish and 1 carne asada.  We also got the almond horchata.    The food was incredibly forgettable.  It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way.  The presentation was great but who cares if the food is bland.  We were both very disappointed in the food as well as the horchata.  I got the feeling that this place was so busy creating a hipster-friendly environment that they forgot to worry about their food.    Overall, the place had a cool look, friendly service, and the prices weren't terrible but I'm never going back simply because the food was not that good.  I'll be hitting up Joe's BBQ across the street if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.

This is healthy food done right. I like the protein bowl (hideous name, wonderful taste). The price seems high but I'm a big dude and was full only halfway through the meal so it was well worth it.   The juices are good but overpriced in my opinion.   Great service, awesome patio for when it's not 120 degrees outside.

I don't drink coffee so I can't speak to their particular cup of joe.  However, I've eaten their twice: Once for a sandwich and one a muffin.  The sandwich was subpar.  The muffin was pretty good.  White chocolate something-or-other.    It's not that Charlie's has personally offended me or anything - it's just that I would prefer almost any other restaurant in existence to inhabit that spot instead of Charlie's.  If I'm forced to grab a snack in the law building, Charlie's is it.  The vending machines never take my debit card (idk why) so I'm forced to eat an overpriced, ok muffin.  It's unfortunate.  At any given restaurant I can at least find one item that's not too expensive that I like.  Not Charlie's.  It's an anomaly.
