I have to say, after reading the other reviews, I'M SHOCKED! I've been going to this Dees for a few years and have NEVER experienced what I am reading here. Strange...  The staff has been nothing but courteous and helpful! They greet us when we walk in and apologize if they are unable to get to us right away (serving other customers).  They've even come up to me to ask if I need help finding anything.  As with most retailers, I avoid going on weekends. Stores in general are typically just too busy and I personally don't have the patience. Since I like to receive good customer service, I try to pick the best days and times when I will likely receive it.  I won't argue that Dees' prices seem high for many of their clothing items. However, their shoes and dance tights seem comparable in price.  Making exchanges is super easy too.   That's been MY experience.  I hope other Yelpers who have had pleasant exeriences here will post their reviews.

This is our preferred theater! Relatively close. Many movies showing. Not overcrowded (we avoid the weekends). Friendly staff. Big comfy theater seats. And clean bathrooms!!   My spouse and I LOVE the $5 matinees. I noticed this deal wasn't offered this summer though. I also have a Stubs card. This gets me $10 off of concessions every time I spend $100 in tickets or food. This works great for us - a family of five. We spend $100 easy at the movies, especially since we almost always buy snacks.  My spouse and I enjoyed Monday's matinee of the Dark Night. Only a handful of people were in the theater. Nice!

We've been coming here for years. Although, most of our visits are for to-go orders. The service has always been friendly and we like the food. We usually don't veer off our regular items. We stick with chicken limone, chicken Marsala, and spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs.   Remember the food items are family style and the prices are the high moderate side. My family of 5 can eat here for under $80, but you can easily pay $100 if you get another side or dessert.  I'm glad they are generous with their fresh bread!  Come here dressed casual as many families dine at this location.

Very good expertise! Very professional staff! Very well trained! Very diverse services! Very good customer service! Very good communication! They order, deliver, and install!  My family has used AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS for years. I remember their first location in a small office building. Now they moved a few buildings down to a warehouse that has impressive AUTOMATED ENVIRONMENTS! See a complete and working home theater showcase! And see them take home security to whole new AUTOMATED level, like locking your doors and setting your house alarm from anywhere with your mobile device and WiFi. It's really cool.   They have come to our home for things like repairing and upgrading our central vac system to installing our home security camera system.  For all things electronic, technical or AUTOMATED, call them first!

This Starbucks is always so darn friendly! Never a bad service!  What can I say? I'm a repeat customer. Why? Well, not only because they're darn friendly! Also because they offer more than coffee! Their coffee is great and all, but I really enjoy trying their panini's and refreshers. Yum!  I am amazed at how consistently happy and courteous the customer service is here. Is it like this at all Starbucks? I may never know. I like it too much here to try anywhere else on purpose.   I've been to other Starbucks and the service varies. Here, it's awesome all the time! Not only are their cold green tea Refreshers refreshing, so is the service and atmosphere!

Love this place! I don't go often enough because I never pass it. It's close to my neighborhood but I rarely drive in that direction.  Nonetheless, I'm a big fan! Prices are amazing compared to the quality for "fast food." They prepare the food to order.  Their tender and delicious teriyaki chicken and their garlic shrimp are must-haves for my fam! The BBQ ribs are a hit for the kids too.  Friendly service. Happy place. Casual and relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Try it.

We've been coming here since my oldest was 4 (or was she 3?). She's 12 now. My youngest is 6 and he wants his 7th birthday here in December.   Clean, reliable fun. Easy way to entertain your kids without moving around much yourself (once your kids are schoolagers).  If you don't want pizza, order the salad bar!  The food was surprisingly fresh and good!  Now they have chicken sandwiches and chicken bites on the menu.  I don't know about all that, I just know I liked the salad bar.  I think it's cool that they offer these other food options for parents.  Keep socks on your kids' feet.  I'm not sure how often they shampoo the carpets.  My kids' socks are usually black on the bottom by the time we leave. This doesn't surpise me.  It's not a knock on their cleanliness at all.  Their bathrooms were in really good condition. Just keep socks on your feet is all.  I can sit.  They can play.  I'm a fan.

Going out of business!? For good? Or to reopen after restructuring??? ... No wonder the service was absolutely horrible when I was there in February 2012. We were redecorating our daughters' bedrooms. They had shared a room and finally got their own. Anyway, no customers were in the store and the those who were "working" there didn't seem to have a care or a clue.  I'm bummed about this though. I loved this place, especially when we moved to Gilbert, AZ, 8 years ago. I guess the economy took its toll on it.

Regularly mess up your order.  Far too often ask you to pull around and forget to bring out food. One good note: Ralph in drive thru is the nicest senior citizen I've ever met!

Remind me never to drive thru here again. If I check-in again - shoot me. I'm not a huge fan of Sonic, except I like their limeades and crushed ice. I've never been to this location before and I won't recommend it.  The service was fine. The gentleman who took our order was patient and nice. However, whoever prepared the food didn't prepare it as we ordered it. I asked for no mayo and got mayo. That pretty much ruins the burger. How can you take mayo off? Yuck. My daughter's chicken whatevers (bits? pieces? nuggets?) caused her to ask "Is this chicken?" She's 10, and not that picky. So that must have been pretty bad.  I thought it interesting that the drive thru guy encouraged me to fill out the survey to be entered for a drawing for a free something or other. Why? Because he didn't give my daughter any honey mustard sauce after he attentively asked how many packets she wanted. I usually don't fill out those surveys. I may start now...  Nice drive-thru guy. But absent-minded (I suppose we all have those days.) Good slushes and limeade. (This would be the only reason I'd come back.) Bad food.

It's a public school run like a private school. One of the best in the state. One of the lowest teacher turnover rates. The staff and volunteers seem happy here. I'm grateful I'm already zoned for my kids to attend Val Vista Lakes Elementary.

Ick. Their panini's aren't what the used to be and the Caramel Roaster was way too sweet!  Now I've never been to this location before now so maybe this is consistent for them. But I receive much better quality from Wendy's in the east valley, Mesa/Gilbert area.  The service was nice and the drive thru attendant was very patient with my questions. For that, I am appreciative.

This is my top choice for replacing my car battery.  I bought a battery from an Autozone in Chandler a couple years ago. I visited here in Gilbert when I began to have battery problems. I was a little perplexed because it didn't seem that my battery should be dying so soon. And I didn't have a receipt or anything to prove it.  Good news!  Autozone had my account in their system and a record of when I bought the battery. Yay! (Doing the happy dance.) The records said the battery had a few months before it was set to expire.  Since it was still under warranty, I got a new 2-year battery for free! They installed it for me and everything. PLUS, they will discount my next battery purchase because the previous one was defective. Yelp, you heard it right!  So Cool. So Awesome. What was especially sweet is that I didn't have to ask for all this. I didn't have to whine or throw a tantrum or demand to see a manager (All actions I wouldn't have taken anyway, but you know what I'm sayin...).  I have to say, I think I trust Autozone. I am hesitant to say this because I was taught NOT to trust mechanics. So we'll see. But as far as batteries go, they seem to be the real deal.   Like I said, this is my top choice for replacing my car battery.

So far I like this store just fine. The customer service is friendly. And it appears to be a full-service store. You can mail your stuff, rent a mailbox, shop for office supplies, make copies, order specialty print jobs, fax, notary, etc.  The place was relatively busy but there were two friendly staff working so the wait wasn't so long.  When I come across good customer service, I come back. I'll be back...

Look. Don't go anywhere else to buy fine jewelry, ok? You hear me?  I've known the owners of this place since 2005. They are the most charitable couple I've ever met. Now... You may not care about charity... Ok... That's cool. That's your right.  So what, if you don't. But do you care about rocks? Some big and shiny, others smooth and colorful, mostly sparkly and attractive, yet many rare and unique... ROCKS?   Treasures is owned by an awesome family! ... THEY ROCK! (Ha!) ... Their employees rock too! (Ha, HA!) ...Something about a family business...where IS that in this day and age? Where's the attention to detail, the care for the customer, the follow up, the fairness, the feeling like you're the most important customer they've ever served? ...at Treasures, baby.  Yelp. I'm gonna say it. It's just too easy to pass up... You are truly treasured at Treasures!! (Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!! Yeah it's corny but so what. That's what makes this review fun to read, and another reason why you should pay Treasures a visit. The visit is free. (That goes without saying. But I said it.)  Not only are YOU treasured, but that's what you'll find - TREASURES. Lots of beautiful, shiny, high quality, fair-priced treasures.  I should stop. I know, I know. It's so much to take in! But I hear you. I do.   I hear you silently yearning..."Please write more about Treasures!" ...Ok OK! You win. I will. Hold on... Let me rest my mobile-phone-typing thumbs and wipe the sweat off my brow...  Continuing... Treasures is not a hop-skip-and-a-jump from our house, but it's worth the trip! You will never forget this establishment once you step in - especially if you meet their eccentric owner and award-winning designer, Scott! Oh and by the way, he personally  buys many of the precious stones HIMSELF! He personally flies to other countries for his stones. He flies by airplane, although he'd probably tell you different. He may even wear his cape to work the day you visit. But I digress. My point: He makes sure YOU'RE truly getting the best of what you're paying for. And by cutting out the middle man, the prices are cut too. :D (You know you like it!)  Go ahead. Read the other reviews. Search them on the web. TRY to find something wrong. Good luck. You'll need it.  My free advice? Instead of wasting any more time, hop on the Loop 101 and go visit my friend, his fun-loving wife, attentive staff, and one-of-a-kind, custom, unique, award-winning jewelry.  No need to thank me. ;)

This place is great!  From the service to the food, you won't be disappointed!  The prices are perfectly affordable!  Great for anyone on a college budget or static income.  The pizzas range traditional to unique, and so do their sizes!  I am impressed how they taste good - even the next day (just reheat in your oven until the cheese crisps slightly).  Their specials and deals are phenomenal. And they've won some awards for the best sandwich - or something like that.  That's right, they provide sandwiches and salads too!  I've had their salads.  I think it was the Greek salad. I was satisfied.  I don't have any serious complaints.  It 's clean enough, including the bathrooms.  And they are charitable too! They have raised money for Childhelp, a nonprofit that aids in the prevention and treatment of abused and neglected children.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars to leave room for them to do something that completely takes me by surprise. And then I can write an updated review to reflect that. :)  What would that "surprise" be?  Oh I don't know.  If I knew, it wouldn't be a surprise.  So...

2-star resort gets 2 stars. This is not a place where I would choose to stay if I were visiting Vegas. But I'm here for a dance convention/competition for my daughter and this is where it is held. So...  This is an old place, despite the recent renovations. The suites are cheap at $74-80 per night this time of year, but you get what you pay for. Our room was all right. I have no place to complain, given the price we paid. The staff was friendly and cooperative. We didn't eat here as there are places within walkable distance. Hard Rock Hotel and resort is across the street, CVS is on the corner, and The Strip is less than a mile away.  Don't stay here if you're looking for 3-5 star quality. You're not gonna find it.  I did like seeing security regularly monitoring the property. And the guests that are here during our stay seem friendly too.  Personally, I'm not coming back by choice, but if simple-basic is the way you groove - go for it! I'm too high maintenance for this... LOL!

This is the perfect place for teens to shop for trendy and comfortable styles at REAL comfortable low prices!  My daughters and I love finding boutique items at discount prices! It's amazing! We saw a blouse at a boutique for $50 and bought it here for $20! Can't beat it!   And their clearance racks are the best! Don't sleep on this place - you'll miss out on savings!  Friendly staff. Usually very helpful. Lots of promotions and sales going on year round.

I've always liked this place. And I have a feeling I yet to take advantage of the full menu.  I typically order the caramelized onion & sausage.  Yum!  And when I'm in the mood for salads, it was the Caprese salad.  Nowadays, when I'm craving bread, I order the caprese bread with pesto sauce, mozzarella cheese, and vine tomatoes.  Mm. Mm. Good!  I don't dine in often. When I have, the atmosphere was cool but can get  loud when crowded.  I like how the servers come to my table to see if we need a to go box or refill.  When they are busy, the won't be doing that.  I've had my eye on trying their wines but hadn't done it yet.  I don't drink that often anyway so I rarely think about.  I do think it's cool that they offer this though.  I think if this place as "new style" pizza.  Maybe it's not new, but it's new to me.  When I want pizza but need a break from the Pizza Huts, Domino's, and Little Caesars, I go to Sauce.  And I am satisfied.

Bought a Nook HD+ today (3/4/13)! Thanks to my friend/sista who wanted to treat me to an early birthday gift!  This is my first tablet purchase. And my experience was AWESOME! The Nook rep came over after I took my time browsing the area for a while. I inundated her with all kinds of tech-y questions as well as price comparisons vs. value of other tablet brands. The gal knew her stuff! Oh gosh... What was her name?... Where's the receipt... I'll be "write" back...  ... Thirteen days later ... Oh this is just ridiculous. It shouldn't take this long to finish a review. But I couldn't find my receipt! Man, I wish I could remember her name. She was a real nice and helpful lady. Go see her when you are ready to by a Nook... whatever her name is...  Oh and the experience got better! The checkout was the smoothest and quickest I ever remember experiencing at B&N! I let the sales lady know that too. I left a happy customer.  I got nothin' else to say.

Love this Fry's! Same quality products as other Fry's and Kroger stores but smaller store.  Staff is friendly. I like the greeters! And Stella is super sweet and helpful at the self-checkout. She likes to chat.   Anyway, this is my neighborhood store and it actually feels like a neighborhood store. Same associates, same managers, and they seem to recognize me too!   I love buying deli meats and different cheeses at the fresh deli counter. And let's not forget the gas points! It's super cool when I earn $2 off per gallon. Don't freak out. 2000 gas points is easily attainable for a young family. I rarely spend $2000 to get to 2000 gas points. I buy the gift cards and get 2-4x the gas points! That's how I do it...  Just today the produce section received a makeover! Very nice! Looks like a high end farmer's market in here! Produce is nicely arranged on cherry wood displays. Photo coming soon!  This is my store.

Great place to go for cheap basics. My 12 yr old daughter is a tomboy/athlete. We did almost all her school shopping here. Not too many frills and thrills - just as she likes it. My other daughter is a girlie girl and we found fun stuff for her too! If you're looking for affordable casual basics with style - go to Old Navy!

Just what the name says: Fast. Clean. Car wash.  I like how I can stay in the car and get a thorough car washing for $9.99 that includes my tires. PLUS, free vacuums for the inside! It's a spacious carport that offers many vacuum stations - for free! Nice.  I come here for my regular washes. The kids have fun riding through the car wash too!

Prices have increased since my last time review in 2012. This is still my go-to car wash when I don't want to get out of the car and need my car cleaned fast. I'll be heading over there today for a wash and to vacuum. I'm a repeat costumer. Some of the poor reviews on this place are unfortunate. Sometimes I think a proper perspective is necessary: it's a fast, drive-thru car wash. Not a hand wash or detail, folks. You get what you pay for. If you want a better wash, pay $40-$150 for a hand wash or detail. To pay under $15 bucks at Fast Clean Car Wash, for a fast clean car wash, I've been satisfied.

I like the fact that this is inside a Safeway. Not because it's Safeway, but because they have longer banking hours than typical. PLUS, Starbucks is inside too! Right next to the Wells Fargo. Now that's incentive!  The people are nice and the lines have never been long for me. They usually have candy or bottle water too. I like that.

This is my corner Walgreens. I've been getting my prescriptions and last minute knickknacks from here since 2004.  The pharmacy is wonderful! We used to have this one pharmacist for years who got to know us pretty well (...by drug store standards. I mean, she knew who we were by the number of ear infections, pink eyes, and colds my kids would get year-round). It was a cool relationship.  Anyway, something happened to her but I don't know what it is was. Sad, she's not there anymore (Hold on I need a moment...ok I'm fine now.). The new pharmacists rotate quite a bit so my visits aren't personal anymore.  The photo guy with the dreads is way cool! LOVE him! In fact, all the staff there have been friendly every visit. The store is always clean and typically have everything I need in stock. I especially like the discounts I get buying the Walgreen brand.  Now, they have a rewards card! Cool! We get points for filling prescriptions too! Nice... I just started the program so don't  know the benefits and value just yet. I'll post tips about that in the future.  Bottom line: clean, friendly, affordable, and convenient.

I've never felt more secure and assured in my medical treatment than here at the specialty clinic, specifically.   My doctor took his time educating me on my treatment options. I never felt rushed. My PA is amazing! She is so patient and careful while treating me and giving my dosage instructions - every month.  I love how Mayo mails me my appointment  itinerary way in advance. I love how the Mayo Specialty Pharmacy calls ME each time it's time for a refill. And then they SHIP it to me. For free! That's convenient! That's cool.  They are usually on time or even early for my appointments too! I've never had such a great medical office experience before!  The cafeteria food is impressive too! Lots of options and made-to-order items. The turkey burger was delicious!  Great place. Great staff. Great treatment.

Convenient. Efficient. Good customer service. Polite.   This is where I go to buy my tires. I would rather not go anywhere else. They've proven to really know what they are doing. They are upfront about pricing and options. They will tell you about how long your wait will be and stick to it.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We visited here 3 times last month! Delicious!  Good food! Good service! Good atmosphere! Great entertainment! Friendly staff! Family friendly!  My kids love the baby back ribs and burgers. Hubby loves the chicken and fried pickles. I love the smoked brisket salad and fried green tomatoes! Their sides are yummy too!  Don't sleep on the dessert! The red velvet cake is on point!  On one visit, we were offered 3 free desserts to take home. THREE! Why? Because our food came out late. Really? We hardly noticed! We didn't complain nor ask. What a way to be proactive with customer service! That alone will have us coming back again and again!  Their live entertainment is slammin' on Saturday nights! Especially if you like New Orleans/southern-style blues and jazz.  Visit Lucille's and have a fun time (and leave full as a tick!)!

I was here last year. Not impressed. Food was not memorable. Atmosphere was too casual if that's possible. Too many flies in this way-open, patio-style restaurant. Service was - well I don't remember. But what I do remember was that there is nothing about this place that says, "Come back!" ...Nada. My experience wasn't awful but I have no incentive to return when there are so many other places to eat at Tempe Marketplace.

I like going in the early afternoon during the week. I avoid the weekends and the weekdays after 4pm like the plague. Crowds drain me. I avoid them when shopping.   I like the bulk prices, clean store, friendly staff. However, I'm not the exploratory type, though that is one of the personalities Costco markets. That's why there are no aisle signs. They want you to explore, discover, and search for what you need - in hopes you stay longer and end up buying more of what you see, even though you don't need it. It works, even on me. I admit.  All in all I go because I have a consuming family. So buying in bulk saves me money and time because - in theory - we won't run out of things as quickly.

Wow. I'm surprised I hadn't written a review for this place yet. I must be slippin'... Below is my take on the useful-funny-cool of HL.  I was super excited when Hobby Lobby came to Arizona! When I lived in other states, it was my "go to" place for all things creative and decorative from flowers, frames, fabric, and furniture to crafts, scrapbooking, and candles. So I felt especially special when it opened here, just a few miles from my house! Whoopee!  * Home for the Holidays... Their holiday stuff is superb. If you're one of those that likes to decorate for just about EVERY holiday known and unknown to man, you are smart to shop here. (If you're not one of those, be prepared: the store looks like it "threw up" Christmas and Easter when those holidays come around.) Ha!  * Girly Gifts Galore! Looking for something dainty and original for that hard-to-please delicate friend or girlfriend? You are smart to shop here.  * Please Pass the "Parent" Projects: I come here when I need "assistance" when "assisting" my kids on their school projects (I'm really beginning to hate those elementary school projects - adults are really the ones equipped to create them. Just sayin'.). Hobby Lobby has an array of do-it-yourself kits for - ahem - hobbies! ...Go figure!... I purchased a Volcano Kit to help me - I mean my daughter - create and operate the volcano for a group science project a year ago. They got an "A" on it. Go HL! I am smart to shop here.  * 4 stars instead of 5: I agree with previous reviews that the checkout lines are not efficient. Partly why is because they do not scan barcodes. They enter the prices manually for each item. WARNING: Since we - the people of the 21st century - are no longer accustomed to a barcode-less checkout, experiencing manual input of prices, quantities, and discounts may bring on acute irritation, especially when the lines back up. Management says they save their customers money by not converting to the barcode/quick scan system. ... Aight then. Whatever you say, HL. I say, "Humpf." ... BE ADVISED: when you budget your time to shop here, consider adding on a few more minutes than typical for checking out.   * The Whole is Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: This store is way bigger than its competitors and carries a greater variety of items. During my visits, this location has been well-stocked and relatively clean for a craft super store. They are closed on Sundays so that their employees may spend time with their families. And they carry tons of "faith-based" items for just about everything imaginable. I like that.   If you're a "Craft-Head" or craft addict, you are smart to shop here.  On the whole, I'm a fan of Hobby Lobby. Not an addict. But a repeat offender.

I love this place! We were just here last night! The atmosphere is relaxing and fresh! It has a sophisticated yet "young adult" feel to it. (BTW, I'm 37 and still consider myself young, ok!) the sushi is delicious! Spicy Tuna Rolls are my fave! My hubby regularly orders the BBQ flat bread and pot stickers, which are cooked and served to perfection!  We ordered dessert for the first time and they were amazing! The brownie has got to be the best this Valley has to offer! Check out the photos! And the pineapple upside down cake has the perfect balance of rich and sweet.   Our friend ordered a cheesecake and to his shock, no cheesecake on the menu! He couldn't believe and was visibly disappointed. That's when he settled for the brownie. After his first bite, he never mentioned cheesecake again.  My spouse and I ordered the pineapple upside down cake but got to taste the brownie too! Oh-My-Goodness! I'll be ordering the brownie next time for sure! Not too sweet, it has the perfect amount of chocolate, moisture, and deliciousness! Mmm, Mmm Good!

Well it's taken us long enough to try this place out. We have no excuse, we live around here.   JP Pancakes did not disappoint! The service was fine, though the waiter was a little quirky and harried. He says they were unexpectedly busy on a Thursday.   Busy or not, the kitchen must be running just fine! The food was delicious! My daughter had the nutty, banana, Belgian waffle and I had the strawberries and cream one, and we shared a side of eggs and hash browns. Very, very satisfying!  Did you know they make oven-baked pancakes? Never heard of that before. We will definitely come back to try them. We would have this visit but we were in a hurry and it takes a minimum of 20 minutes for that order. So keep that in mind.  Overall we felt comfortable here, enjoyed the food, were satisfied with the service, and will be returning soon!

We ate here last night. It was surprisingly quiet on a Saturday night but we didn't complain. This off-the-strip burger joint was a good experience! We will be back! You get to make your own burger and they have meatless burger patties for our vegetarian friends. The chocolate milkshake was delicious! And everything  was fresh. Service was slow at first. It took a while for the waitress to come by at first. But after that it was all good! Try it out! It's off the strip but not far from it!

I'm glad I fell upon this place! We are frequent Subway customers and have finally found its competition!  I love the grilled sandwiches, especially the hot pastrami on white with provolone, jalapeño, and pickles.  My kids love the huge brownies! ...And the fresh sliced deli sandwiches too!  Never been busy when I've come in - maybe one or two customers but that all. The line moves quickly.  The service is friendly. I like how they say "bye" and "come back soon" as we leave. That used to be commonplace for businesses. What has happened to courtesy? I miss the south (raised in Texas)...

From the staff to Dr. Carlsson, this eye center is a step above the rest! Making appointments is super convenient - it's online! And their staff calls back within 24 hours to confirm. Perfect! They are patient and kind. You will not feel rushed. Dr. Carlsson answers all of your questions and provides complete information as well as multiple treatment options. You'll be more than satisfied with your care here. Both of my daughters have been treated by this office and really liked their experience! They aren't afraid to come back!

All 3 of my children come here! We will never go anywhere else for their dental appointments! You wouldn't either!  Large, comfortable lobby! Train theme with working train moving traveling throughout the office and lobby areas. Each time my son comes he flocks toward the train play set or the games.  Awesome covered playground right outside the office! No sand!  The staff! I'm telling you... Always kind. Perfect with children! Gentle and fun! Kids where cool sunglasses during the exam. The hygienists make sure your child's experience is safe, fun, and bright!  My son's first dental appointment was at this office and they put him at ease. Why was really great was that he got the chance to watch his sisters' cleanings first. That helped make his first time it not-so-scary.  The doctor is very informative and patient when it comes to talking to the parents and patients. I like how Dr. Clark educates us all. Dr. Staker was the kids' first doctor, but he retired due to the onset of a heart disability. He was super great and we are glad he was our doctor for the first few years going there.   In other words, Pediatric Dental Specialists provides amazing care! You won't be disappointed!

I'm sold. This place has too many of the same cheap items I can find at the grocery store or discount stores like Target (namely party stuff and gift wrap and tissue paper and arts & crafts). Why go spend more than a dollar for the same stuff? I'm not.  Staff is friendly and place is clean and well organized. Plenty of parking space too.

This place is close, clean, and customer friendly. The staff always speaks and offers assistance. The shelves are usually stocked with what I need. They are very well versed in nutrition and the products they offer. They seem to like it when I ask questions.   The Vitamin Shoppe has a free member card they use to send coupons and specials. Their prices and hours are reasonable too!  I'm glad The Vitamin Shoppe is in my area.

Fresh. Hot. Fast. Drive-thru had GREAT customer service.  I don't know what to say about the previous reviews. Perhaps this location had a management change for the better.

I love this store and I love this location! I shop during the week so it's never busy when I shop. And I like the personal attention I get from the staff.  Love love love the sales!! Especially the scented candles and wallflowers.  I admit it, I spent a bunch a money. But I know it all gets used and our home smells lovely!

I came here a few times a few months after it opened in Dana Park (Even before the first review of this place hit Yelp, I think).  Well, I see I am not alone.  Don't even get me started on my experience.  It was epic awful.  (1) Wax was too hot.  I told the aesthetician.  She ignored me.    (2) Wax was dripped on my hair - sticking it to the paper pillow case. (I couldn't move.  I was stuck!)  Oh wait!  There's more!   (3) Wax the size of a quarter was stuck on the top button of my blouse. Blouse cost $50. I never got the wax out. It's BLUE! The wax is blue! I could never wear that blouse again. I bought a new one.   (4) Wax was visible on my neck just below my earlobe.   Other than wax in my hair, I didn't notice the other wax issues until I got into my car and looked in the mirror.  This was after I was face to face with the receptionist at check out.  She looked at me kinda strange but didn't say anything.  Now I know why.  Oh yeah, before I checked out, the aesthetician said she was sorry (as she was prying my hair from the paper pillow case). That's it.  This aesthetician was not my scheduled aesthetician.  That one was sick. But no one bothered to call to tell me.  I mean, we're talking about beauty here!  And this is my face that is being waxed!  The most visible part of my body!  The only face I have!  Come on!... Let me know I don't have the person I personally scheduled! Give me the option to reschedule before I check in!... Terrible.  I had seen my original aesthetician twice and was satisfied.  Even her work wasn't fantastic, but I was willing to work with her - you know, give her some time and tips. That was the plan...   One positive note, once I found a way to contact upper management, the owner called me right away, profusely apologized, offered to give me 3 months free wax, and to replace the blouse. I thought that was a really nice gesture.  I considered it. But that's all.  This experience traumatized me, y'all!  I ain't ever going back.

I was here the other day. I needed a new printer, cell phone case, blue tooth headset, and hubby wanted the movie The Avengers.  I like this store! There is one 1.8 miles closer to me but I prefer this one. I'm willing to drive farther for it. That already says enough.  This store is super clean and I haven't had an issue finding customer assistance. In fact, the assistance found me - again and again. Real Cool.  Perhaps it was the day or the time. I don't know. I do know I went in knowing I had a lot of shopping to do, and left happy.  I visited several departments and a representative was available for assistance. One of them was really only passing through and still was patient with me as I mulled over which too-darn-expensive-AND-easy-to-lose Bluetooth headset to buy.  On to the printers... Here is where I spent the most time. You see, my smart phone has a scanner app and Best Buy has those square-shaped bar codes (I forgot what they're called) on the boxes and display signs of their products. So I spend the next 20 minutes reading the reviews of the printers. Ugh! I HAD to make sure I was buying the "right" printer, right? So I ended up with the one I would've picked anyway, before I got the "bright" idea to read product reviews.   I mean, don't get me wrong, I LOVE reviews (HEL-LOoo!! Can we say Yelp...). But seriously! Too much information + too easy access = time robber. I was nearly late picking up the kids from school...

Delicious cupcakes! Large cupcakes! Fresh cupcakes! Worth the cost! I've read several reviews about the workers' attitudes at Caketini. I've never had an issue with the employees there. They have been teenagers each time, but they have been friendly and patient each time too. Perhaps it depends on the time of day. I've never been at night or when it has been super busy. I go mainly during the weekday. Whenever my family and I are in the mood for a cupcake, this is our spot!

Aw man! I was craving a red velvet cupcake this evening. Hubby was a sweetie pie and decided to drive the 10 minutes each way just to get one for me. (Awesome)  You know, it's the cream cheese frosting that makes the red velvet magnificent, right? Well, my frosting looked beautiful, but wasn't cream cheese! It tasted more like butter icing with too much vanilla extract.  Oh how disappointing! The cupcake was just aight without it. Boo. Hiss. Grr...  Give me my money back.

I've been here a couple of times. It's access from Gilbert Rd is super convenient. The people were especially friendly too. As far as the cupcakes? Well, I love the variety. But the times I've tried them, they were dry. Perhaps this is because my purchase was in the afternoon? Not sure. But if that's the problem, then maybe they shouldn't sell cupcakes that late, if the quality fades dry.  If I ever make it there in the morning, I'll let you know if it's a better cupcake.

Disappointed. I wish I could give this location 5 stars but I can't. The first day here was great.   The second day, not so great. I guess for the price we pay and by my experience at other Einstein Bros locations, I expected more. Would you believe it took 20 minutes - AFTER we stood in line 10 minutes just to order - to get 1 sandwich! Wow. They were very slow at making the food. But at least it was good - says my daughter. They were out of the Tuscan bagel for the Tuscan Tasty Turkey sandwich so I passed. Disappointed. I really wanted that sandwich but it isn't a Tuscan Tasty Turkey sandwich without the Tuscan bagel. It was 11:00 am, the baker was gone for the day, and they were already out of bagels used for lunch sandwiches. That sucked.

My kids and I like it here. We come often on Sunday's when it is typically not too busy. Their burgers are fresh meat made to order. So delicious! They added a new item to their menu, garlic fries! So good! They also sale ice-cream and offer a variety of traditional and creative flavors! The atmosphere is a throw back to the 50's and the customer service is excellent.

I agree! Glad the cupcake place next door was closed for the week! That's the only reason why we stepped in here!  Delicious and creative flavors! Perfect balance of yogurt and ingredients! The watermelon and pomberry sorbets are my favorite so far!  And I SO appreciate the FREE samples! Yeah! Stop by and try this place! It's quaint, cheery, bright and cool inside!  Treat your taste buds!

All three of my children have been going here since 2004. Dr. Werther is the best doctor! Since we started seeing him, our wait time has been cut to almost zero! He amazingly patient and thorough! I love how he speaks to and relates to my children (ages 12, 10, 6). If you choose EV Pediatrics, request Dr. Werther! He is VERY experienced!

Usually the wait is less than 15 min. for a blood draw. I go in the middle of the day between noon-3pm. Depending on which tech you get, you may be blamed for the tech's inability to draw blood out of your vein. That gets so annoying! If my doctor (who NEVER has had a problem getting my vein for a blood draw or weekly IV) didn't have his office way in north Scottsdale I'd have him draw my blood (since I have to do so weekly for the treatment I'm under). Only because this Labcorp is super convenient in locale, and the wait is quite short, I keep going. But if I find some place better that's closer, I'm jumping this ship.

Love this church! At Impact Church you'll meet real people (SO human), experience real worship (If you want to be entertained at church, this praise & worship team is Grammy worthy!), and believe in The Real Jesus!   I like the choice of services. There are 3 right now. Our children enjoy their ministry as well and I love all that my 1st grader is learning, including bible scriptures! Very safe, fun and organized!   Because of it's rapid growth in recent years, you may be inconvenienced by the long walk from the parking lots, because if you're running late, you'll have to park across the street! But the parking committee is extremely friendly and they help direct you to the best spot available.  This church is contemporary in it's look and worship style. They use current technology for audio/video presentations and music. The worship stage and backdrop is very cool. You'll have to see for yourself.  We drive 30 minutes every Sunday to attend this church where we have been helped and where we are able to help.  You should visit. It won't be a waste of time. And there's no traffic on Loop 101 on Sundays! Woohoo!

I had brunch here with a friend today. She ordered a delicious breakfast (wish I could remember what it was called) and I ordered the Ahi Tuna Crunch Salad. The food was delicious! We both cleared out plates!  The service was on point! Even a gentleman opened the door for me! At 10:40 am? Cool.  Our waiters were on top of things. We got our order fast and the drink refills were flowing.   The atmosphere is contemporary and comfortable. One of the owners even spent some time with us at our table. Really nice guy. He cares deeply about his new restaurant. I hope and pray for its success.  I look forward to coming again with my hubby. I'm still salivating over that salad! And I was eyeballing the burger and their breakfast omelette, and I'm curious about the desserts! Yummy!  Come check this place out! I noticed the 15% discount for Yelpers. Especially cool.

You won't be disappointed at this Starbucks. It's inside Safeway so it's never been busy when I've stopped in. The service is friendly and the drinks made to perfection!  An extra bonus: a parking spot upfront reserved for Starbucks customers! Nice...!

Great place to go to rent instruments!  My daughters each played a string instrument in elementary.  Rather than shell out hundreds of dollars to buy one, I rented.  Glad I did.  One of them is no longer playing an instrument.  The customer service is good.  Sometimes they are slow if they're busy.  And that's because they are giving each customer their 100% attention.  I like that.  They are hassle-free when it come to returns and repairs to.  Since we rent, the labor for repairs is free.  They will also tune your intrument for free.  This is key.  When one of my daughter's strings broke off her violin, all I had to do was pay the $1.50 for the string!  They replaced it and tuned right on the spot.  I bought my husband a keyboard from here a few years ago for Christmas.  It was on sale too!  Awesome deal!  He was very happy with the gift.  And I was happy with the price!  Great place to go for instruments AND intructions too!  Yelp! They offer music lessons and camps in the summer time.

Formerly Legends Cadillac. Will continue review later, mentioning good maintenance service and rep Luke. Use to be able to rent a car but doing away with that all together. Buying a car was less enjoyable than the quality maintenance which is crucial in deciding if I buy my next car from here. Awesome lobby with TV and fresh snacks and Starbucks coffee. Cupcakes and bagels too.

Ok so I'm updating. Earnhardt Cadillac is still my trusted place for my vehicle service and maintenance. My Escalade is 8 years old now and still runs like a charm. My service rep is Luke and I'm grateful to have had him all these years. He is friendly, professional, and patient with me. I especially like how he takes the time to distinguish the recommended work versus the necessary work that needs to be done on my vehicle. He is very fair.   When I purchased my vehicle in 2005, this place was called Legends Cadillac. In my previous review, I mentioned my car-buying experience was less enjoyable than my service experience. I said this because I know I got duped into paying more than I should have for the vehicle. But, honestly, that was my problem, not the dealerships. My problem was I expected sales persons to be fair. Oops. How naive of me. They are sales persons to make money, not to be fair. So, I have to concede to the car-buying experience as something to learn from, not criticize. Next time I buy a vehicle, I'll have to approach the process differently, expecting to be swindled - and try not to fall for it.  Oh and one more thing!... They have gone back to providing complimentary vehicles when you have service! No need to pay to rent a car, or sit there for hours, or arrange for a ride home. Yippee!

Yippee!! I found a donut spot close to our home and super delicious!! This place is  called Good Donuts but could be named "BEST Donuts"! They're that good y'all!   The staff are friendly, patient, and personable - just like the donut place I grew up with in Texas. That place is called Best Donuts and are owned and run by a "mom and pop" family too!  Glazed and buttermilk are tied as my favorite donuts BUT it's the croissants that keep me coming back! Original, ham & cheese, and ham & cheese & jalapeño. Take your pick. You won't be disappointed.  I'm so glad I found this place...reminds me of home.  Now I gotta go work out to burn it all off...

This place is so cool my daughter wants to work here - in the summer, when it's hot! (And when she's 16. She's 14 now.)  The costumer service is refreshing! Young people/teens being attentive and kind? (and pigs still can't fly!) ...Yep. It's happening here at this Dutch Brothers.  Their coffee is really good! My daughter likes the white chocolate mocha freeze and I like the regular freeze. Watch out for those "brain freezes" though - ouch! The prices are less than the leading competitor yet the quality is great!  The lines are not too long usually, and when they are, they move super fast. They even have a barista outside taking orders to keep things moving.  Perk #1: Fast drive thru...That's cool.   Perk #2: Stamp cards for a free drink. Shhh...sometimes they give you extra stamps - just because...!! Turn up the AC...That's hot.

You will appreciate and love Dr. Maegan because she loves what she does (and it doesn't hurt that she's great at it too.)!  Dr. Maegan is friendly and her staff always greets you at the door. You won't feel rushed even during her busiest hours - EVEN - if you're a "walk-in." I like that.   On my first visit, she took a thorough history and X-rays too. She has an X-ray machine in her office. Nice and convenient.   I've been seeing her for several weeks now and I am amazed at my progress! Before seeing her, my chronic neck and shoulder issues wouldn't budge and my range of motion was limited. Today, I am much improved! My neck pain is virtually gone! And I can - finally - fully look over my left shoulder while trying to change lanes on the road (maybe I shouldn't have said that...). It's so exciting! I haven't gotten these results until I began to "Get Well Be Well" with Dr. Maegan.  Quick tip: When you arrive at her office, don't be confused if the sign on the door has a different name. She shares the office with another chiropractor. He's cool.  Bonus: So at one appointment, while we were casually talking, I mentioned that I was congested and had been drinking lots of green tea to help combat that, etc. ...just casually talking about my day and how I was feeling... Anyway, she said, "Oh ok, well let me adjust your ears." ??? My ears? You can do that? Sure enough, she adjusted my ears, opening them up to help relieve the congestion. Wow. Adjusting the ears...I had no clue. Glad she did. You see, that's a bonus.  Come see Dr. Maegan. She'll straighten you out. Plus, she's cool. So seeing her would make you cool too.

Have you been to Lo-Lo's yet? Oh my goodness don't wait another minute! The soul food is on point! The customer service is excellent and the servers make you feel like you're at home. We frequent this spot quite a bit, so much so, that the waitress already knows our drink order and entree. I changed it up on her last time, though, you should've seen the look on her face! Too funny! The menu has a variety of options so you'll never get bored! The fried catfish, collard greens, and of course the waffles, are my favorites! The people working there appear to like their job too. That goes a long way. Anytime my husband wants to go out and eat, we already know where! Maybe we'll see you next time!

It has been a LONG TIME since I've enjoyed a DQ treat! I ordered a Heath bar Blizzard in size small. It was delicious! Took me back 13 years when I use to frequent a nearby DQ in Texas.  Customer service at this corner suite at the mall was nice. It wasn't busy and the 2 workers were attentive and patient with the 4 of us (me, my 2 girls, and one of their friends).  The place was clean and the worker was helpful in directing us to the nearest bathroom (about 20 steps away).  Only surprise: the size small was too much! All of us struggled to finish passed half way. We should have ordered the mini. Now we know why it's on the menu.   I paid $3.80 each. Sounds pricey until you start eating it. We definitely feel like we got our money's worth. Plus, the size small, when they fill it, towers over the top about 1-2 inches!  I can't promise I'll frequent this place (I mean, I DO have a waistline to consider), but I definitely recommend it.  One more piece of advice, eat it outside. We about froze our tails off until we got smart and sat outside. DQ Blizzard + 103 degrees = "It's nice outside. Let's hang out!"
