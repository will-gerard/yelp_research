I got a discount off of Groupon for a month, and even after the first class I'm hooked!  The location is a bit hard to find.. park near the AJ's and walk into the corner of the complex. I just followed the girls with yoga mats after I wandered around a bit. TIP: the cubbies are in the bathroom, not at the entrance.   The studio was definitely not what I expected, but in a really good way. The staff was very friendly, the studio was carpeted and relaxed unlike other places I've been. I hate the elite attitude of some yoga studios in Phoenix but this place totally lacked that competitive and snotty Scottsdale yoga/soccer/wino Mom vibe.   The yoga itself was difficult. I consider myself quite fit and healthy and seriously, this class kicked my ass for the next two days. DRINK WATER. Bring 2 bottles. Wear layers and be prepared to take them off. Don't wear lotion or sunscreen; you will sweat it off and it will burn your eyes. I don't even recommended wearing contacts because mine basically swam in my sweat the whole hour and a half.   The smell takes a bit of getting used to, as does the whooshing sounds (I had to bite my lip to keep me from laughing) and sweating. Overall though, the staff is great, the physical studio is great and best of all, it's not snobby yoga!

My experience here has been wonderful! I get my hair cut by Lettie and my eyebrows does by Lily.. and they're both gems! I highly recommended Lettie for anyone with curly hair. She listens so well to what I want and they delivers with a beautiful cut. And Lily is wonderful too.  Though this is an Aveda salon, it lacks the uppity vibe that I expected. The staff is professional and knowledgeable but also welcoming and sincere. Love love love this place!

I think this place is a Phoenix institution and this location specifically.  However, you have to come in here with the right expectations. This is not My Sister's Closet or Nordstrom Rack. Nor is this a retail store. A trip to Buffalo Exchange is a treasure hunt without a map; the treasures you find are hidden and rarely what you were looking for.   I think Buffalo as a chance to try on a different style or brand that I never have before without the high risk of expense or snooty employees (or other customers) The key is trying something new while keeping an open mind!   I suggest hitting up the dresses, skirt and blouses first.. that's where I have the best luck because things are less worn. I've found all sorts of beauties from brand new J Crew blouses to BCBG dresses. The shoes are also excellent.   If you're trying to sell check their website first to see what they're looking for to save yourself some heart ache when they pass up a beautiful sweater. And seriously, don't take it personally if they don't want your stuff. It's just clothes... :D

This is my favorite bar in North Phoenix because it's a true "local," just like the ones I found living in Ireland. The staff is great, though colorful, the atmosphere is top notch, music is great though loud and the drinks.. delicious! Sure, it's not for everyone.. this isn't a Scottsdale skank bar or West Valley sprawl corporate bar. It's authentic. It's Phoenix.. or a weird Irish version of it.

Love this place with my entire heart.. but it threatens to bankrupt me.   Any time I need to fine unique, beautiful gifts (like housewarming presents, birthdays, graduation, etc) I always head to Francis. It's the first and last stop in beautiful jewelery, accessories, bath and home products. The very, very, very best time of year is Christmas because their ornaments are AMAZING! I've given them to all sorts of people and they just adore them.  This place is genuine Phoenix. Love it and shop at Frances.

I absolutely adore this place! The prices are reasonable, the staff is easy-going and the food.. fresh, delicious and consistent. It gives our family a healthy option close to our home. I don't go a week without eating a Granada salad or Porti sammy!

I tried this place out because it got such good reviews, but I feel like maybe these other reviewers went to a different salon... definitely NOT going back to this one!  I went in and instructed my stylist VERY specifically. I wanted to keep it long, no chin-length or shorter layers and I DON'T WANT TO DYE MY HAIR. I exited Cherry with four inches gone, short layers and having been lectured the entire cut with the 100 greatest reasons my natural hair sucks. No, I don't want to dye it. No, I don't want to straighten it. No, no, no. You can't sell me anything else.   I couldn't wait to get away from the over-sharing stylist who tried to upsell me every product in the store and dissed my hair repeatedly.. I just paid and vowed no never return.

For a small new studio, this place is tops.  I love the location because it offers a choice to the pricey Yoga Pura close to my house. There's enough parking and it's really easy to find.   The classes are small but the experience is extraordinary. The teachers listen to your needs and injuries and address them. They even take the time to learn your name!   I really loved this place and plan on making it my regular studio.
