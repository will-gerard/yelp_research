I always get coupons from them and it always bring me back to buy their chicken and the price are also good too. But they don't have a drive-thru like the one on baseline and I'm just being lazy..

I came here on my way to school the other day and didn't get the chance to sit down and eat there but they are express so you can always do a take out which is pretty quick, i ordered teriyaki chicken with broccoli and can't wait to try what else they have to offer.

well its my school, so I thought what would be better than writing a review for you own school... what could I say about Phoenix College?? The school is pretty small, smaller than the rest of the Maricopa colleges if I'm not mistaken. But there is a reason why I drive across the city to come to this institution, I love the staff and the instructors who are here at PC, they are very well knowledgable at what they are doing.   I have been attending here for couple of years now and I just like it here, community colleges offer smaller class and get better interaction with the instructor which is the way I learn best, and they are more than happy to help you with anything you need. Plus is cheaper to get your core classes at a community college.   The parking is a little crazy from 9-12, and 4-7, one time I drove around for 40 minutes until I finally found a parking space. One thing I don't like about this school is the citation they give out, They give you a citation if you park reverse/facing the wrong way without any warning or anything at all. Well I guess I learn the hard way. I love the fact that Phoenix College have a parking garage, to those of us who knows the heat well in the valley know that that's a life saver right there... keep your car nice and cool without having to worry about passing out trying to start your car, but you go there during the crazy hours you won't have a chance of finding a parking spot.   Overall I am happy with the school and will recommend anyone who are in the area looking to farther their education or anyone who just graduate from high school..

So I finally got the chance to try out this place, drove by couple of times and had friends said it was really good and they been coming here since kid. It was a hot Sunday afternoon in Phoenix so me and a friend was thinking what's better things to do than get some ice cream..   This place definitely be here awhile and you can tell, as we walking in we were greeted and was seated down. The place have a 60s look to it and it was quite unique, even the employees dress according to and compliment to the store. All I wanted was some ice cream and was the reason I came here, I got the 3 dip homemade waffle bowl with mint chocolate chip, cookie and cream, and caramel pecan. I got to say this was one of the best ice cream I have tasted in a long time. Plus I didn't know 3 dip and each dip was two scoop. It was very felling.   The employee was very attentive and nice. The price for ice cream was really good for the amount. I am very please with it. I am looking forward to come back and see what else they got. One thing that caught my eyes was like a bucket of ice cream that was over $100, sounded very interesting. But man who could eat that much ice cream anyways.. Anyone who haven't check out this place should give it a try, I mean I liked it. I haven't try anything other than their ice cream which was great.  One other thing that I really like is they close at 11 on Friday and Saturday which is awesome, now I have a place to stop by after work for ice cream.  WILL BE BACK AGAIN.

Came here with my sister to get her scooter (puma)oil change and they said they can't change the oil and we understand but then we go ahead and try to ask if they sell the type of particular oil but they don't even want to answer the question, and acted like we weren't even there and because we didn't buy the scooter there. Service not good but have a good selections of bikes. Not recommended.

Around the area this food city have some of the best fresh produce with a awesome price that is hard to beat. As a college student 6 roman noodles for a buck and 3 powerade also for a buck is great. Big money saving right there. Their prices are low and in a certain day there are special going on that you got to keep an eye out for. Recommend this for all your grocery needs.

I got to say this is one of the best visit to the dentist in awhile. Dr. Rao (Tony) and his staffs are very professional and friendly. They made a dental visit a very easy and comfortable one. He knows his craft very well and made a tooth extraction easy and not in such pain that it's unbearable. The price is very good and you'll be in and out of there in no time. Will recommend this to friends and family. Very happy with the result.

This was the first time we visited Big Surf and was not disappointed. But very crowded which is normal for a weekend but this was the holiday weekend so they close a little earlier. Good deal on groupon but the locker cost pretty much the same as the ticket. I had to leave early before i get to enjoy the park completely but will return again for sure. Not a bad place at all.

oh Zia good thing you are around, this is a amazing place to get use CDs, DVDs and video games that are no longer available in other stores. They also have collectible toys, cups, key chains, books, old records and many many more..   the staff are pretty cool and the place are clean. sometime if you are lucky you can come across a amazing find that is worth more than you paid for... or priceless for some each individual. I don't personally know much people that listen to CDs nowadays but for me they're amazing which this is the place to get them at.   kind of hard to leave without buying something..

One of my favorite place for sandwiches, Lee's sandwiches got amazing variety of sandwiches, snacks, baked goods and drinks (coffee, juice, tea) to chose from. They are busy but is not a long wait for your food. The only con I could think of is they only accept cash but they have a ATM by the line incase you don't have cash in hand. They're doing this so they can keep the cost low I guess....   Such a big fan of their sandwiches but too bad this is the only location in Arizona, mostly located in California and its such a long drive from phoenix but worth coming to check it out and its great deal. Whenever I come here I usually just order a bunch to take home.  They need to open more locations in the valley..

This place have been here quite while now, long ago when we use to live in the area I use to remember riding my back here trading books, movies, games, CDs, magazines and whatever else they sell and trade here... it was the best thing as a kid, trading your old games to get a different one which they still do and I like that.   You can find old books movies, games and CDs that are no longer available in stores.They also have handmade begs, jewelry, handmade art/paint, toys, comic books and many collection items. and many many more.. too much to name them all. Oh and they also have music instruments.   Great place to get your books and even read them here. They have wifi to use, they also have kids area plus the establishment is very well taken care of, clean bathroom and helpful employees. Its a nice place to be and worth checking out if you never been here before, will not be disappointed.   I returned here often to check out what they got to offer and I always leave here with something I'm glad I have bought it.

We had been their costumer over 6 years now and we're finally moving on, their poor costumers service had exceed anything I ever come across. The last two month we paid the bill with cash in the store but they seem to have lost the records of any bill being paid and they are charging us fees over fees. I personally try to go in and show them the payment that was made but they give me a hard time. with 30 minutes of arguing and explaining they finally removed one fee,   I got to say I am disappointed how much they have changed in costumers service. I really hope they will turn around and give more happy costumers their time and services that they want and deserve.

Got to say the worst Denny's I ever had been to, we simply came in to grab some fries, the food was done and the only two worker who is working here took a break/went outside at the same time while the food is siting cold.   Not recommended, very disappointed at the night shift worker and my visit here. They also didn't care to clean to tables or even pick up the plates. I don't know about other shift but the night shift had a very poor costumer service

Godzilla was awesome, this Harkins Theaters was very busy, more than normal or maybe because its the weekend. Either way we enjoyed our movie and the staffs are friendly and theater was very clean and well taken care of. No trash on the floor and everything was just great.

Are you looking for a Asian/international food? well this is the place. This Ranch Market is one of a kind (Asian version) which is great. There so many selections of Asian produce and endless variety of dry food. It's a great place to shop if you know what you are looking for but if not you can go on and on without having any idea what you are looking at. They carry many type of rice and also have imported beers.   They also have seafood and mini bakery with good price. This got to be the biggest Asian market in town. If you are up for something new to try you can come and get some pretty unusually stuff we don't normally find here in the states, what I mean is pepsi flavored cheetos, green tea kit kat bar, coconut flavored sunflower seeds and many more for me to discover next time I am here. Recommended and worth the time to check it out.

This particular Walmart at south Phoenix is different from the rest, I don't know about you guys but this is the first time I came across a Walmart that is closed at midnight. Always thought they'll open 24/7. Came here with my family and try to grab a few things before heading home, not our local Walmart so not use to their set up, so I asked for assistance to help me locate the rest of what I needed, so I came to up to one of the employee and ask, they said give them a minute and they will come back and help me find it. Waited there for awhile and no return. Costumer service could be improve.

what I love about Costco is their great price, even on gas. This particular Costco is more toward business rather than the normal Costco, they do not have a photo center but do have printing/copying center. One other thing I keep forgetting whenever I come to Costco is that they don't not accept any other credit card beside amex. great place for wholesale and gas.

This 99 cents store is well kept and clean. You can't never go wrong with 99 cents stores, find things that are inexpensive and very useful for a good price. They have everything from produces, dry food, house and car products and my personal favorite is the awesome selection of candy that they have here.   The employees are friendly and willing to help if needed. This particular store is seem to be better than the rest maybe its closer PV thats why. But its always nice to shop here, they got fruits, vegetable, chips, sodas, camping gears, and many many more...  worth checking out if never been here...

Nice, clean and friendly gas station. The gas price is reasonable for which the station is located. This might be a minor thing but I like is they have free air, which other gas stations charge for $1 just to put in air for your car. They also got good choices of snacks and drinks.

I have been here once but they are close and today I got opportunity to check them out, they're right at down town Glendale, can be easily missed because its a house but also a ice cream place which is located in the back of the house, Papa Ed's Ice Cream is a nice, cool and fun place to be, there are outdoor seats that is nicely shaded and cool which would be perfect for the summer time. They also take party request like birthdays or group events. The ice cream are very tasty which are from shamrock but the waffle corns are homemade which is the best. I'll be back again and will bring my little cousins and family.

One of my favorite things about thrift shop are you never know what you will find, its either you find a treasure or leave empty handed. Phoenix Christian is a neat little thrift store, very clean and organized, the store do have more housewares and furniture which is great. They also have a variety selection of vintage items. Price are good for what its for, the staff are friendly and more than happy to assist you with anything. Will check back again to see what else they have.

Not too please with the results of this car wash, got my car wash here with full service which was 15.99 and it looked like it just got a normal car wash which was 2.99. They hardly vacuum the floor and there was still dirty spots left from all the bugs. Friendly staff but the result wasn't all too good, it wasn't worth the money.

Zero star, we have been waiting here for over 3 hours and still nothing, when I call back they keep telling me it will be "just another 30 more minutes" I don't know if they are towing the valley with just one driver but this type of costumers service is not acceptable, I don't know how they are still in business. I will not EVER recommend this towing company to anyone. Don't waste your time.

I just love the fact that they're open 24 hours everyday not just the drive-thru. No matter if you are a early bird or night owl you can always stop by anytime to get some donuts and coffee and be on your way. They have many variety of donuts you can choose from with good prices, but they don't just sell donuts. They also sells sandwiches, shave ice, teas, and many more.   The facility is well maintenance and employees are friendly. It's worth the time to check them out and will not be disappointed, We wasn't, and whenever we are in this side of town we will stop by here.  Wish there are more of this type of places in the valley.

The market has many variety things needed for home cook meals, but the place is not all too clean. The fruit and vegetables are not fresh but I guess if you need dry products you can get it here. It use to be Phoenix Oriental Market but things hasn't change much. Just different name and owner I believe.
