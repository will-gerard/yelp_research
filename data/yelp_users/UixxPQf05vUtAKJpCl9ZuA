As soon as I found out that the Desert Botanical Gardens had a Dale Chihuly exhibit I knew that I had to go.    Honestly, if it weren't for the Chihuly exhibit I probably would have never gone to the garden but I'm so glad that I went.  The garden in the spring was absolutely beautiful. Displaying desert plants from the Sonoran Desert in the Southwestern United States and around the world.  Many of the plants in bloom at the time that I went.  Although it was spring and the temperature was tolerable I can't imagine taking a stroll through the gardens during the sweltering summer days.  There isn't too much shade along the paths.    The employees were really friendly and very informative.  I also really appreciated the fact that the gardens were so well maintained.  Parking is free.  Adult tickets are $22 and Students $12.  Unfortunately, I believe the Chihuly exhibit has ended but don't let that stop you from checking out this beautiful gem.  Would definitely drop by the gardens if I'm ever in the Phoenix area again.  I loved it!  Don't forget to bring your hat, water, and some sunscreen!

I was looking for a cheap place to stay after driving to Phoenix from San Diego and I figured that Red Roof Inn seemed pretty decent for $70 for a night so I decided to book on Trip Advisor.  While I was checking in I decided to use the women's restroom downstairs in the lobby and I couldn't believe that the mirror was taped on to the wall.  I mean literally probably 5 dozen pieces of packing tape holding it in place.  I figured no big deal will check in anyway.  The check-in was a breeze.  Went to our room and at first glance it seemed ok pretty dated but ok.  The fiancé and I were so tired from driving we just decided to lay on the bed.  We looked on the bedside table and saw several bed bugs? Or ants?! Just crawling everywhere.  Disgusting!  I had to check to make sure there was nothing in our sheets.  I should have complained to the front desk but I just figured we'd be in and out in a few hours.  I definitely wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel or anything but I at least was hoping for something clean!  Yikes.  The only positive experience from Red Roof Inn was that the employees were friendly and there was a Waffle House close by!  Apparently because they do not serve a continental breakfast but have free coffee downstairs!  I'm sorry but will definitely look elsewhere the next time I am in town.

I never eat my bagels without cream cheese ever.....until I tasted a St-Viateur Bagel.  I watched from behind the counter as the bagels were being pulled out of the wood fired oven as my sister ordered me a sesame seed bagel.  These bagels were FRESH.  Hot crispy buttery outside with a chewy center it was absolutely delicious!  Who cares about the carbs!  I believe the condiments are sold separately but I'm not quite so sure since I did not feel the need to order any!!  If you are in the area definitely drop by to try a bagel you won't be disappointed!!

I really loved Jardin Nelson.  Not only is it located in one of the most historical areas in Montreal but the ambience is so quaint and romantic.  What a great date place!  I love the beautiful garden in the terrace and courtyard with the live Jazz music playing.  My sister really emphasized to me that the outdoor seating was year round with their gigantic parasols and "water catchers".  We frequent Jardin Nelson every time I come to Montreal to visit.    The service was friendly and quick.  My Jardin Nelson experience is always so pleasant.  Their crepes are delicious and the portions will leave you stuffed.  I've had their Râble de Lapin and the Diva.  Both delicious.  That's one of the things that I love about Montreal is you can get gamey meats almost everywhere!  I love my Lapin with its musrooms, cheese, and white sauce.  It's so creamy rich and delicious.  I recently ordered their Pâté chinois au canard which is basically their version of Shepherd's pie and with the side of beets and fruit ketchup what a perfect combination.  I'm drooling thinking about it.  There are a variety of food options including many vegetarian choices and quite a variety of beverages as well.  I think that the prices are reasonable averaging ~$15 per dish considering the service, ambience, and quality of food.  I hope to come here again the next time I visit Montreal and most definitely recommend others both visitors and locals to try Jardin Nelson.

I dream about Schwartz's.....it's that good!!!  The first thing I wanted to eat after I stepped off my 8 hour flight from California was a "fatty" smoked meat sandwich and I don't care how long the line was I'd stand in it.  Every single bite is so mouth watering as the meat simply falls apart and the flavors are extraordinary!!  You have your choice of the "lean" meat which still has a little bit of fat still but what's the point?  You need to go all out here fatty all the way. Don't forget to order some fries, a cherry coke, and some pickles to complete the meal.  The last time I had Schwartz's was probably a little over ten years ago but I can still remember it vividly.  Thank you Schwartz's for making my trip to Montreal complete!!  Je t'aime!!

The Barnes & Noble of Montreal!!  I feel like good bookstores are hard to find nowadays with the internet and increasing amount of eReaders around.  I have an eReader so in actuality there is no need for me to go to the bookstore.  However, I find that I do like to be holding the hard copy of a novel in my hands and Indigo was the place to go!    Indigo had a wide range of book selections and obviously French books as well.  The Indigo staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  I overheard one of the staff talking to another customer recommending various books and I liked that she was very knowledgeable about her book factoids.    From the cafe you could enjoy a dessert and cup of coffee while reading a book or watching the busy street below.  Overall, Indigo is a great place to go to browse through some books and to sit and enjoy a nice relaxing day.

As soon as I stepped foot into Point G I was mesmerized by the all the different colored macarons and the variety of flavors I could choose from!  They were all so beautiful.  I felt like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory.  I was ready to eat everything!!!  I purchased 6 for $9 and I regret not getting more.  You have your pick of flavors from nutty to fruity to savory Point G has them all.  Foie gras, curry, vodka cranberry, maple, pistachio, orange blossom, lavender blueberry, salted caramel, dark chocolate, and the list goes on!  These macarons are absolutely delicious!  From the flavors of your first bite through the crispy shell right down into their chewy center your taste buds will be yearning for more more more!  I believe they even sell gelato here but I didn't even get a chance to look at it I was too excited about the macarons.  Make it a POINT.....to drop by Point G!

My sister took me on a spa day at Spa Scandinave during my visit to Montreal and I had a FABULOUS experience.  The customer service was on point and the employees were very friendly and accommodating.  This was my first time at a nordic spa so I don't really have anything to compare this experience to but it was just great.    We just used the spa and sauna for a few hours so we started off in the dry sauna then off  to eucalyptus steam room which was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  Lastly we then took a plunge in the Nordic baths.  We repeated this process 3-4 times then laid down in the relaxation area and I felt like I was in heaven.  There is a health bar close to the relaxation area where you can order smoothies and other snacks.  Spa Scandinave was very well maintained and clean.  They are very strict in making sure that the noise levels in the facility are kept at a minimum.  All the toiletries in the bathroom creams and lotions are all organic and smell wonderful!!!  I loved them all.  I just wanted to keep on slathering it on my skin.  I wish I did not live so far!  Until my next visit to Montreal Spa Scandinave.  I definitely recommend others to try this place you will not be disappointed!!

This review is based entirely on my bar and drink experience.  My sister and I were looking for a place to grab a drink and chat so we decided to drop by and try out La Drinkerie since it seemed to be a very happening place on a Friday night.   It was very convenient that La Drinkerie was walking distance to her home and open late.  The ambience of the restaurant was nice very modern and urban chic.  It was very trendy in my opinion.  I decided to order a dirty martini and my sister ordered a Tipperary.  We asked the bartender if they had vermouth and green chartreuse for her drink and so she said yes.  She later came back to us saying no she did not have any vermouth or chartreuse so we changed our order to a  plain and simple Jameson soda.  Maybe it was a miscommunication or she didn't hear us since it was quite loud in the restaurant.  No big deal.  Later on the other hand, we were literally appalled when the martini came as it was given to me in a glass that was less than half full.  Apparently, the bartender insisted that is how they serve and make their martinis (gave me a look) and in return offered to make me a different drink.  It was an embarrassing experience and I probably will not go back the next time I come to Montreal to visit even though the patrons next to us ordered a charcuterie plate that looked quite delicious.

My fiancé and I were looking for a place to grab a quick eat before our drive back down to San Diego so after doing a few Yelp searches for lunch spots we decided on Ollie Vaughn's.    Don't be fooled by the exterior appearance of this cafe.  I was a bit hesitant considering I am not familiar with the Phoenix area.  I thought it looked a bit sketchy but I don't know I'm not from here!  I loved the mural on the side of the building in the parking area and the hair cut store next door looked quite trendy!  As soon as I stepped foot inside this cafe I was greeted by the friendly staff.  Their menu was simple a few sandwich and salad options and yummy baked goods in their glass case.    I ordered the chard grilled cheese which had rainbow chard, mushrooms, white cheddar & mozzarella. I added turkey to my sandwich and I had it on a brioche.  The fiancé ordered a ham sandwich and a lavender iced tea. It doesn't stop there we also ordered a whoopie pie!  Portions were just enough for lunch and the sandwiches came with a little baked powdered sugar dusted cookie treat!  I really overindulged here but it was worth it.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious!  My sandwich was crispy ooooey gooooey!!  Yum!!!  I loved it and wanted more!  Prices were reasonable ranging from 7-8.50 for a sandwich.  10 for a sandwich and soup combo!  The ambience inside the cafe was very inviting....very vintage with the mason jars....loving the display of cookbooks which caught my attention Momofuku and Bouchon!  The outdoor patio dining area in the back with the herb garden and fruit trees was so cute and very great for the photo ops.  I overheard one of the other customers saying that the owner was going to change up the menu to use more ingredients from the garden for the upcoming spring menu.  Definitely recommend Ollie Vaughn's!!  Wish I lived closer but if I'm back in the Phoenix area I'll come back here for sure!

Dropped by Hula's while strolling around Old Town Scottsdale.  The fiancé and I were looking for a place to have dinner and we came across what looked like a hip and happening place.  Honestly a bit out of place in my opinion considering that Hula's is this "modern tiki bar" right in the heart of this western old town scottsdale area but nonetheless we decided to try this place out.  Hula's had quite an extensive menu with so many items to choose from I was a bit overwhelmed but our very trendy sweet server Alexis recommended their spicy Thai chicken bowl and their fish plates.  We decided to try both.  I ordered the Thai chicken bowl minus the beans and the fiancé ordered the lemongrass encrusted hapu.  I was really disappointed because we originally wanted to order the butterfish but they were out but Alexis mentioned that the hapu would be another alternative option.  The fish was absolutely delicious!  Light and flakey and just every bit of perfection!  I loved it!  Very much comparable to one of my favorite restaurants I frequent in San Diego for Hawaiian fusion dishes!  YUM!  The portions here are pretty hefty as my Thai chicken bowl was huge! Definitely could feed at least two I think because I can eat for two!  Prices here are reasonable for dinner ranging anywhere from 7-26.     A great date place since the lighting is so dim it really sets the mood haha however I saw tons of families and children dining here.  Would definitely come back the next time I visit Scottsdale and recommended others to try Hula out.

I happened to stumble upon the infamous Shake Shack while on a family vacation to Arizona and so when I saw this I was so excited to finally get the chance to try it out without having to go to the east coast!    Being from California I've only known of In and Out (and other burger joints smash burger....burger lounge etc) and I've read several comparisons between Shake Shack vs Five Guys vs In and Out.  Upon reading the menu there were several items to choose from.  All their ingredients are all natural no hormones no antibiotics etc etc the new trend in "natural" foods.  They use a potato bread which is very soft and in addition to the burgers they have chicken options as week as a shackago-dog.  Shake shack has several shakes to choose from in addition to the standard chocolate, vanilla and strawberry flavors and they sell several custard dessert concoctions to satisfy anyone's sweet tooth craving!  Shake shack also serves a variety of adult beverage options.  I loved shake shack's fries probably because I love crinkle cut fries even though some may say it's similar to eating them straight from a bag of frozen crinkle cut potatoes from the grocery store.  I feel like I'm betraying In and Out by saying that since they have the fresh cut in house fries!  To each their own!  Everyone has their own opinion right?  Shake shack's cheese fries are good but it just tastes like cheese whiz to me nothing fancy but I enjoyed this also!  The meat patty was so juicy and definitely a lot bigger than the other fast food joints.   However, it wasn't as flavorful as other burgers I've had at other fast food joints.  Nonetheless I still did enjoy the burger.  A little pricey in my opinion for the burger, fries and a drink (~$10+) but I guess it is what i would expect or a place that sells fresh high quality ingredients.  I love love loved their strawberry mint lemonade which was their featured flavor of the month.  I hope they open one in San Diego soon because I would definitely want to have it again!
