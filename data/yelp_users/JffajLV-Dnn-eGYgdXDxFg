This little store is located within the Arizona Center here downtown.  I have shopped here before, as it is in the area that I work at.  It is locally owned by a couple, and they actually have two locations...this one and another location in Gainey Ranch in Scottsdale.  This place carries mostly touristy stuff.  I think thier prices are a little high, but the store is well kept, the people that work here are wonderfully nice and kind, and you can get a garden variety of items to choose from.

Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.  Eating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.  My only "complaint" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling "less important" then maybe the dine in patrons.

I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.   I have a few vague memories of eating at one as a kid, a college student, and now a full fledged adult.    I came here last night with my date, and we took the light rail.  Walked in, and it was quiet, but it was also a Sunday night.  We only had to wait 5 minutes.  The hostess and what appeared to be a manager were taking names.  The manager was so funny and personanable...when the girl said "what is your name?"  I spelled A-M-Y instead of just saying my dam name....when he called my name he spelled Amy instead! ! LOL. Date and I laughed!  We ordered our food with our server, who was nice and knowledegable enough. But, we had to ask for our Bread!  For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.  Anyways, place and service was fine, will be back, and I still love it here!

I can't believe I've never reviewed this place before. I've been here countless times before, and watched the place get upgraded and remodeled several years ago.  I can't remember the first time I came here, but it was some time ago after I moved out here. The convention center has an older part thats smaller, and a new addition that's huge!  Plenty of events are held here all year round, from sporting events like the NBA all star game, to the auto show, they had an NRA convention a couple years ago with a zillion people, along with other regular yearly events like the auto show and several others.  The place is large, and has 3 levels (a basement area, main level and upper level) with a crosswalk to get to the other side which is pretty darn cool. It's huge, spacious, and modern looking with its updates.  Escalators, stairs, etc.  The place is sparsely decorated with Arizona stuff that makes it really cool looking. They also have a cool light feature outside that illuminates the walkway with different colors at night and is really pretty to look at as well.  The cool thing about it is too is that its easily accessible via light rail, and you don't have to spend $$ on parking...and let me tell you, the parking here isn't cheap! $12 for the garage, $10 in lots around, and its not any cheaper the farther away you get.  I don't know why anyone would want to park down here, since the light rail is $3.50 round trip, so save yourself a few bucks and take the rail. You'll thank me later!  There's also food and dining in here as well, with a variety of different style resturants, but again, its outrageously expensive!  They have a starbucks here too, which is their regular prices, but is like an extra $5 a person to eat here, so dine elsewhere before you come in here.  (minus the coffee since Starbucks is the only reasonably priced place in here.)  Plus, the convention center is a hop, skip and a jump from about a zillion other cool dining places that your better off eating at anyways, so do that instead.  Aside from that, this place is pretty huge, and its worth checking out. Plenty of clean pretty bathrooms and tons to do in and outside of the center with variety of different sized spaces to hold any kind of event, large or small.

I've been working in the Arizona Center for about 4.5 years now, and I've finally decided to review it.  I like the design of this place well enough, as there's plenty of shade, its well landscaped, and theres some form of security to keep the hobos and crackheads out 90% of the time.    The restaurants here are mediocre and somewhat boring.  In regards to lunch, you have Subway, which I am sick of, dirty water pizza at Cafe Roma, hooters (greasy tasting), Starbucks (great service), Unos, (dark interior, mediocre pizza), 1130, Sams Cafe, Big Fat Greek Restaurant, Coldstone, NY & Co, AMC theatre, and a barrage of touristy places as well.  Upstairs is an engineering firm and FSN Arizona as well.  I think at one point back in the day, there used to be food places and a bar or 2 up there, but now its different.  The gardens here are pretty, relaxing and enjoyable.  I think based off food and shopping alone, this place sux, overall.  For anything reasonable and quick to eat, your stuck with Subway and Cafe Roma.  Everything else is sit down with waiter service.  I don't have any one recomendation to make this place better, except maybe different/better choices in resturants and eating choices.

This place is great!  For starters, when you enter, its very colorful.  There was some spanish music playing overhead, and loads of things to look at.  They have a huge meat department, groceries, bakery and everything im between.  I wandered through the isles and liked what I saw.  I ended up eating a breakast burrito at thier food bar at the far end of there store.  I think this is a truely southwest expereince to come here, and I wish I had known about it when my friend Jason came out last October.    They also have a lovely resturant attached to this place (as if the store itself won't do it for you) and that it authentic in itself.

I love the DBG!  How beautiful this place is.  What a Phoenix treasure.  The first time I came out here was about 3 years ago with my mom. She's an avid gardener, and we made a point of going here.  We both had a great time with everything we saw, and easily killed a few hours walking around this place.  Well, I came back here with Heather  to see the Chihuly display. AWESOME!  Gardens are lusch, paths are large and easy to walk and there is plenty to see here. Tons of desert habitat here.  I also like how they have water fountians and beverage machines here throughout the park.  Walking can make you get real thirsty real quick. They also have a little cafe of sorts in the back of the garden, which is nice when you are hungry.  They also have benches if you want to sit down and catch your breath or take a break from walking.    Great place to bring family, dates, out of town visitors and anyone else!  Worth the $$.  I will be back!

Back in July, a few of us girls at work found a living social coupon for this place for $20 for $20 classes.  Being that we all could use a little more exercise in our lives, I bought the coupon and started going to classes.  The Yoga studio is tucked away in a shopping center off Central and Camelback behind AJ's fine foods, and next to a hair salon.    The basis of "hot" yoga is to do 26 yoga positions in a room held at 105 degrees with 40% humidity for 90 minutes.  This allows you to flush all the toxins from your body, speeds up your metabolism, reduces stress levels and basically cleanses your whole body while you get a good healthy workout. Intense? Yes, but not impossible.  You will sweat everything out, literally. I admit, like others here, you feel like quitting 15 minutes in because you think your going to die from the heat and your sweaty as hell, but KEEP GOING. IT GETS EASIER/BETTER. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome I felt after my first class. Just amazing!  For starters, even if your a beginner, like me, do not be intimidated! The class is welcoming to students of ALL levels. I've only been to one other yoga class before in my life, and that was 4 years ago.  Here are a few pointers to help you out and tell you more about the studio itself.  A) drink an enourmous amount of water before, during and after class! Especially  the day before class. The day before drink, drink drink! You will sweat like no other during class, and you need to stay hydrated.  Drink a lot of water after class, as your body is going to be dehydrated and you will be flushing toxins out of your body.  Also, when you bring water to class, make sure its frozen before hand.  If you don't, it'll be warm in 5 minutes and useless.  The studio does sell water bottles, but its like $3 a bottle.  You can go to Circle K and get one for a dollar, throw it in your freezer, and take it to class with you.  B) bring a big towel to put over your mat.  Your going to need it to collect the sweat, and to wipe your face and body periodically during class.  It also allows you not to slip on your mat when you do the standing poses for the first half of class.  The studio does rent towels, but it costs a few bucks. I bring a beach towel with me and it gets soaked by the end of class from sweating!  The studio itself is spacious, but fills up quickly.  You want to make sure you get a spot where you can see yourself in the mirror while you work out.  It allows you to perfect your poses as the instructor talks you through the class, helps you become more limber and stay focused.  I personally like to sit off to the right side because during class while the instructor is walking through the studio, they will open the doors and you can get a blast of cool air.  This my friends, is the most refreshing thing ever.  Sit off to the side near the door! You will thank me later!  The instructors themselves are really positive and encouraging.  My first class ever was with this girl Melissa, and she made me feel right at home, explaining everything! Each pose has a benefit for your body, and she (along with the other instructors) will tell you what its for. For example, there's one where you lay on your back and pull your legs to your chest- that's great for digestion, another for reducing anxiety, others for expanding your lungs and so on.  They also tell you to work at your own pace. Don't kill yourself! There's skill levels of all kinds here, and you'll notice it in class.   I would go to classes with my friend Nicolle from work, and we had a blast. Each instructor brings their own personality to class, but you follow the same routine every single time. Some will work you harder then others, but again, go at your own pace.  If you feel like you need a break, lay down on your mat, or do the downward dog position like I do and pick up at the next position after you regain your composure.  The only downside to the studio is the studio itself smells funky! I wish they would spray some febreeze in here or something, because I think it smells! Aside from that, I really enjoyed my time here, and would love to go back in a heartbeat. Staff was awesome, positive and encouraging.  Plenty of class times available, and a great way to get back in shape.

This place is located in a big strip mall where I used to work. I've seen it a million times and never bothered to stop in.  I had to stop by my old job (that I just got laid off from on Monday) and was absolutely starving.   I came in here because I had a few bucks in my pocket, and had to eat something.  I was starving!  So, I cruise in here, and think, how bad can it be?  well, it sucked!  At first impressions, the place seemed okay.  Big menu, decent pricing, etc.  W ell, that's about the excitement of it.  For starters, I stood at the counter staring at this guy who was making a sub.  I don't think he said anything, but just kind of stood there and threw a sub in this little convection oven.  After a few minutes, a lady came out.  The guy started talking to me, but the lady cut him off and then took my order.  I ordered the BBQ beef sandwich.  They come in 2 sizes, a small and a 6 inch. I just wanted a small since I needed to get something in my system after a day of job hunting and dealing with my previous employer.  It was ready in no time flat, and man, it looked SMALL.  And ugly! all in one!  It was roast beef that they threw in the convection oven and doused in BBQ sauce! The meat itself wasn't so bad, but the high amount of bbq sauce made it hard to eat.   Then, I go to refill my drink.  Um, they said it was a $1.00 for refills for smalls, and more for medium and larges.  Um, NO.  FAIL.  Don't charge me for a fountain pop refill. NO NO NO.  I refilled it and sat my happy ass back down.  Food was not good, and I'm probably not going back any time soon. UGH!

I finally got around to coming here last night, and I really like it!  I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.  Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.  They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.  They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.  If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one.

I really like this NYPD location.  I don't know that I have been to one in the past, but I think I could be a fan if I go enough.  I came here for lunch with a co-worker, and we both had a really good time.  They have a nice menu selection, and the staff here was pretty darn cool.  When we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess, who asked us if we wanted to sit down and have a waitress, or go with the Express Lunch.  She explained the express lunch to us, and we went for it!  We didn't want to waste any time digging into our food, and I'm glad the hostess told us about it right away.  The food here was pretty good, and along with plenty of seating, a bar area, and a nice big menu, I can see myself coming back here as a customer.  Keep up the good work NYPD!

So, I love deli food.  a lot.  I've tried a few deli's out here, including these guys, and I have to say, I think I like them!  Prices here are typical deli, but from what I can tell, cheaper then others.  You can get just about anything, anyway you want.  I love how they have Matzoh Ball soup, big huge deli sandwiches, and all the fixings.  YUM!  The past few times I've eaten here, its been on lunch with coworkers.  I've kept it light with my order, since falling into a food coma and taking a nap at my desk after a huge lunch is generally frowned upon by management. I've gone with the Kosher beef hot dog, fries, pickle, and tiny pop for a grand total of $5.24.  My friend usually gets the tuna on wheat while here, and she likes it here as much as I do!  What I do find odd, is that its buffet style serving.  You walk through the line, give your order, and walk down with your plate while the guys behind the glass fix your order.  Service here is quick and efficient, and seating is plentiful, even during the lunch rush.  I would recommend this place to most anyone, and they have multiple valley locations.  yummy!

I love the Cheesecake Factory, and cannot say enough good things about them!  I've never been to this specific location before, but have been to a few others in the valley, and I love it every single time I go.  Weather its for lunch or dinner, with family, friends or coworkers, this place hits the spot every single time.  Their menu is huge, and awesome!  TONS of great food to choose from. Dinners, lunches, and it all tastes so good!  MMM.  Lunch specials, dinners, deserts you can find everything on their huge menu.  The restaurant is quite large as well so seating is plentiful.    Today I went with my coworker during lunch, and we both walked out so full!  We got pasta lunch specials, and it was Delicious.  We were seated within a few minutes of entering, and our waitress greeted us and took our order.  She brought out bread which was hot and tasty, which we devoured.  Drinks were always filled, and we were in and out in a little more then an hour.  I got the spagetti with meat sauce, and the lunch sized one was HUGE.  I will be having leftovers for dinner, trust me!  I will be returning here in the future, trust me.  Menu and food is amazing, love the atmosphere, etc.    I will say, on a side note the parking here has gotten WORSE over past few years.  I will not blame Cheesecake factory because its not their private lot, but its bad.  When I first started coming to this district, parking was open and free, with some valet service.  Then, one day, I came here last year to eat, and it was all chopped up into different pay lots.  the first lots a valet, the next lot is all token pay parking, theirs a pay parking structure in the back, and tons of "15 minute to go" parking around the perimeter of the center.  UM, this is a nightmare to navigate!  There's "free" parking but they shove you way in the back on the "north" side of the lot and you would spend at least 15 minutes walking to cheesecake factory if you were to have parked on that side of the mall.  My advice?  Either circle 3 million times, or just drop your car off in the token paying lot down the way.  I think Cheesecake factory may even validate, but that's my thoughts...  Anyways, I love you cheesecake factory and you have never failed me! MUAH!

I've been to this location a few times now, and I guess it's time for me to write a review of this place.  Honestly, of all the grocery stores big and small here in the Valley, Trader Joes is probably my least favorite.  Over the years, I've tried to like them..trust me, I've TRIED. I just can't get into the Trader Joe's scene.  It's not one particular thing that turns me off about Trader Joe's, but maybe its a variety of small things that irk me. For starters, I find thier food selection odd.  Mostly prepackaged stuff, with no deli, meat counter,  and very little name brand stuff.  I know I know, I don't need to buy every single thing name brand, but there are some things name brand that I prefer over others.  Plus, when I buy lunch meat, I want to go to a Deli Counter and get it, which they do not have.  Just prepackaged meats n cheeses.  I tend to buy mostly sandwiches here during lunch hour.  Their fair priced, and right there.  The first few times I went here, I was getting a Tuna Sandwich on whitebread.  I liked it, and started buying it on a regular basis.  Then, they stopped making it.  Why?  I dunno, but I haven't seen it in like 3 weeks.  Just when I start liking something, it vanishes.  Now all they have are tuna wraps, but they arent as good as the sandwiches.  As for grocery shopping on a weekly basis, I will probably never be a regular here.  The reason I frequent this Trader Joe's is because its A) close to my office, B) there's a decent sandwhich selection readily available, and C) thier staff is always friendly and helpful.

O.M.G.  I always knew this place was swanky, but now I know that this place is REALLY REALLY swanky!  Hot dang!  ok, ok, let me try to review this before I get any more excited!  Capitale Grille is awesome.  I've known about them the entire 6 years I've lived here, but never made it in.  Why? Because I just haven't, and now I NEED to come back here.    For starters, this event was awesome.  Smaller, intimate set in a great location with top notch food.  The staff here is like no other.  Friendly, classy yet approachable all wrapped into one.  The staff circled with lobster rolls, red and white wine, mini tenderloin sandwiches, coconut cream pies, along with a HUGE shrimp thing that was delicious.  The chef came out and talked about how they age their meats at special temperatures, along with the fact that they always get their meat within a 10 day kill date, so its NOT sitting around forever.  So imformative!  They even had huge slabs of beef out for display!  YUMMY!!!  I cannot brag enough about this event.  The staff here is impressive, food was awesome and Lindsay did a great job planning this event.  Everyone was able to talk, there was plenty of seating, and we could hear each other!  THANK You Lindsay and Gabi for such a wonderful time....YOU GUYS RULE!!!!!!

I love my sisters closet! They have a great selection of clothing, in a variety of sizes.  Pants, coats, shoes, purses and all sorts of nice stuff to choose from.  Plus, the prices are great!  I bought a top here for $12.50, and I love it. Its in great condition, fits nice and it will go great in my wardrobe.  Plus, the sales staff was helpful and friendly.  I plan on frequenting here more often, and really enjoyed the selection of clothes that they had, along with amazing prices.  yippie for my sisters closet!

For as long as I've been in the valley now, I've never bothered to stop into souper salad.  Why?  I don't know....but I finally did for lunch today.  I really love how this place is set up.  Salad buffett with lots of fresh options. Not the tired buffet of salad stuff that I've seen at other places.  Many options to choose from, along with drinks, desert, and awesome breadsticks!  I got the combo with a drink, breadsticks and salad to go.  The server at the counter was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed my time here.  I will definately be back in the future!!

So, I finally made it to breakfast club this morning here, and let me tell you, I really enjoyed both. I got to meet a new group of people and eat at a new restaurant, and I was extremely happy with both!  For starters, I got here at 10 am sharp, and realized that this place is closer to my house then I thought. I know they have a couple locations around the valley, but I think they have one in Tempe aside from this location as well.  When I arrived, the place was colorfully decorated and there were people slowly streaming in. I found my group, and we all sat on the patio.  Our server was super attentive, and I realized when she handed me the menu, that they had a weekend breakfast deal with healthy good looking food.  Yes, you can order from the main menu, but they have a great separate menu for their breakfast stuff on Saturday mornings.    The server informed us of the complimentary chocolate fountain with fruit inside as part of the Saturday morning breakfast thing.  After we placed our orders, I went inside and grabbed some fruit and dipped it all in chocolate.  They had strawberries, cantaloupe, marshmallows and a few other items to choose from.  So tasty!  I reviewed the menu and decided to go with the fruit bowl with granola and a $3 Mimosa.  One of the other girls with me ordered the same thing as well, and the others got some good looking dishes as well.  The fruit bowl came out and it was so good looking!  Holy cow! I really enjoyed the whole thing and overall, the prices and the food were awesome.  Service was great too, and I will gladly be back in the future for more.  Thank you breakfast club, you have made my day...and aunt Chiladas's

So, I had a job interview early this morning.  I forgot to print the attachment yesterday, and when I got up this morning, I almost had a heart attack!! I looked to see what kinko's was open early (as most of them are) but was close to where I was interviewing at.  For starters, they open at 6AM. This, my friend, is a huge lifesaver!  I called them first thing, and talked to a really nice guy and got the email address for the store itself. I told him that I would be there in half an hour to pick it up on my way in.  He was really cool, and helped me out with what I needed.  After I emailed him, I called the store back and made sure they got it. I gave him my name and told him I'd be there in half an hour.  I walked in, literally 30 minutes later and the paperwork was ready. Granted, it's not a huge complicated project, but being that I didn't bother to check the night before, it was last minute on my part and lack of preparedness.  I grabbed the paperwork, paid the $$ and took off, all in a matter of minutes.  Thank you Kinko's for saving my ass.  Thank you for being open early and being quick and cool about stuff, and helping a sister out.  I don't know what I would have done of they weren't open so early and so readily available to help.

I've flown out of this airport for quite a while now, since I have lived in Phoenix for several years, and I have to say, its quite a nice airport.  Sky Harbor has three Terminals, (terminal 2, 3 and 4) but it seems that most people fly out of Terminal 3 and 4...well, at least I have.  Plus, since I've had several family members and friends come in and out, I've had really positive experiences picking them up as well.  My most recent visit was to Terminal 3, and it was really fun and easy getting in and out of here. I was dropped off by a friend, went inside and checked my luggage.  Security was easy, and off to my flight I went.  Plenty of places to eat and hang out in here, plus you get free wifi at the airport!  I hate running down my battery, so I try to plug it in when and where I can.  More challanging to find a plug if the airports busy, but its big enough to find one if you really scour.  I also like that theres plenty of places to eat in AND out of the security area.  Makes waiting for a flight much easier, because if I want a cup of coffee, bagel, or something more substantial, I don't have to go through security to get it.  I've taken a few friends to the airport, parked the car, and gone in and had a quick bite to eat with them before their flight takes off.  I've also helped my mom navigate this place as well for when she gets into town so she knows where shes going.  My dad? not so much.  He prefers to navigate his own way.  LOL.  There's also rental car counters in here as well, who will help you get into a vehicle when you arrive.  love it!  Baggage claim here is quick.  I mean, its FAST.  Be prepared to get off your flight and go directly to get your bags, otherwise your gonna be late getting them!  Also, there's plenty of ground transportation here, so you can grab a taxi, super shuttle or what not to get a ride home in case you do not have one.    Even though I have never used it, there's also plenty of on and off site parking here as well.  Off site is obviously cheaper, and most of the spots have coupons along with regular shuttles to and from the lots to the terminals.  I also like how the light rail connects to Sky Harbor as well.  Love you sky harbor, keep up the good work!

I love Port of Subs, and discovered this one near my new job that I started this week. I like it here for a few different reasons, and they have a lot going for them.  I noticed a few low reviews, but wanted to chime in and give my two cents as to how much I like it here.  For starters, they have two lines, which really helps since it seems to be in a busy part of town. There's a lot of business's around and it's close to the airport so I'm sure they get a lot of foot traffic going in and out.  I like that they have two service lines, so there's literally no wait here for getting your food in a short amount of time.  The staff here has been really nice, and seem to get my order out quickly.  The downside? For starters, the drink station was kinda dirty today, and even though there was a staff member there when I went to refill my drink, she didn't seem to try to clean up the watery mess from someone who must have made a mess between the time I got my first drink and the 15 minutes later when I went to go refill my cup. It appeared that someone splashed a bunch of water all over the counter or ice cubes had been spilled and melted and caused a bit off a pool of water.  It was somewhat disarming since I was in work clothes and didn't want to get stains on my shirt, and I had a book with me and really didn't want to get that wet either.    They seem to get a lot of repeat business here since it is in somewhat of a business district. I know they do a punch card system, and I didn't think about it until much later in the day and wish a staff member had said something. I guess they must not be big on enforcing it? Seems like other business's are jamming punch cards down my throat to get me back in the door, but not this port of subs.  Overall a good experience and I'm sure I'll be back in the future.

I got an oil change this weekend, finally.  I was over due, and had the time to set aside for this task.  My boss had reccomended this place becuase they are affordable, and they have multiple valley locations.  I went to the one closer to my house, as it was the most convienient for me.  Now mind you, I had Friday off work.  I wanted to beat the weekend crowd of oil changes, so I tried to get in Friday afternoon.  They do not take appointments (at least at this location) and work off a first come first serve basis.  So, I roll in Friday afternoon at like 4ish.  I go in and talk to the guy and it didn't look busy to me.  Baiscally, he said that he couldn't fit me in right now, and the earliest he could get to my oil change was first thing Saturday morning.  I wasn't going to leave my car overnight for a stupid oil change!  (not that he wanted me too, but seriously?  People do that?  I haven't done that since I was in college and could go without the car for 24 hours.  Not now!)  Anyways, I went back the next morning and got it changed.  Its $17.95, but since my car is stupidly special, mine cost a little extra becuase its a 4x4 and they have to put in 5w30 oil for it, and not the usual stuff.  My total was $29 after tax.  They are good about posting pricing signs thier store, but if your not there at the crack of dawn, I wouldn't count on getting it done.

I have been here several times to eat before, and have always had a great experience.  This IHOP is located off the I-10 and Ray Road.  For some reason, its listed as a Phoenix location when I consider it Awatukee.  I like this place because I have always had such wonderful service here.  The waitresses are always nice to me, I'm always seated quickly, and I dont have to wait forever to get my food.  Decent selection of food night or day, and the place is open 24 hours.  I know its considered a "chain resturant" but honestly, I don't hold it against them. Sometimes, I think we could all use some comfort food (like I needed today) and I think this is a reliable place to get it without sacraficing service or price.

Probably one of the better bagel shops in town.  Its located inside of a shopping plaza, and easy to find as its right next to a Bashas.  I believe they make thier bagels on site.  Fresh, fresh fresh!  I like that.  They also have a great variety of cream cheeses and bagel flavors to choose from on their menu.    They also have a variety of bagel sandwiches to choose from.  Roast beef, tuna, even LOX!  YUMMY.  They also coffee, and some juices and pop as well.  Yippie!  What else I like about this place, is that its just not bagels.  They also have a variety of pastries to choose from, like muffins, and other stuff too.  What else I like about this place is that there is plenty of outdoor seating.  Thats a bonus! Prices are fair and reasonable, and service was fine.  Worth a try if your in the area.

I found this place and its tucked away in a little strip mall.  It's intimate, personable, and has a "cheers" atmosphere to it.  They sell wine by the glass and by the bottle, and the prices vary from reasonable to expensive. They also have a small section for wine knick knacks, like wine stoppers, etc.  Selection is limited and small, prices are okay.  They have some glassware as well, and some of it is really expensive...I saw a wine decanter for like $125!!  yikes.   I reccomend this place for a variety of reasons. First, the staff is awesome, and are totally educated.  Its a wonderfully relaxed enviroment, and its someplace you can go by yourself too, take a date, or just meet up with people for wine or beer.  clean, nice etc.  Its a wonderfully relaxing place to spend any evening.  The down side?  Don't bother eating here.  Stick to the wine when going.  Food here, I think, is okay, and overpriced.  Its a wine bar, not a resturant.  Also, I think they lack variety in things other then wines, like glassware which you can get at Ikea or Walmart anyways.  Plus, the owner lady is always there.  She has short hair and is rather loud.  She knows her stuff tho.

I finally dined here for the first time on Sunday, and it seems like a nice place.  Has a nice homely feel to it, and the menu has many choices.  Service was good, and they also have a bar area to sit at as well.  I had a hard time deciding what to get, so I went with the chicken fingers appitizer.  Portions were good, and service was nice.  I would feel safe taking my parents here, or a friend for a nice quiet meal.

I frequent Sallys on a semi regular basis. I've been shoping at thier stores for years, and return for a very good reason.   First, I am always pleased with the service at thier stores.  The girls that work here are always friendly and helpful.  They greet me when I walk in.  Thier service is stellar.  I always feel like they want to help me.  I almost always have questions when I shop here.  Sometimes its for hair care, sometimes its for skin care, sometimes Im just here to look.  The staff here always makes me feel comfortable and they take the time to help me.  I like that.  They listen to what I am looking for, and are always on the ball with great product reccomendations.  This trip, I was in for some foot care.  Having lived out here for 3 years now, my heels have really taken a beating from the heat and dry enviroment.  I wont go into details, but basically my heels are dry, cracked and its painful.  Ive tried most of the foot products out there to no avail.  I told the girl I was looking for a quality foot care product to help heal and treat the dry skin that I have. She immediately walked me over to her foot products and showed me the cream that would help me best.  She also told me that they have a special going where I get free treatment socks with the specialty creme.  I checked it out, and it was a substantial savings!  I like it here not only becuase of the top notch service, BUT, you get salon quality products at a substainial savings.  I dig that.  I really do not shop at salons, and would rather shop here.  They carry most name brands here at a savings.  They want the public to shop here.  So, next time you want salon grade, name brand care, and excellent customer service, please go to Sallys.  I am always satisfied with them and and thier stores, and have not had a bad experience yet.

I love this Best Buy. Its actually where I purchased my computer from back in April, and so far so good.  Ive bought other stuff from here before, but my big ticket item was my laptop.  Service, hours and location is fine.  Will shop here again.  :-)

I had to come here to get some shipping supplies to send out some scrapbooking stuff I had made for a friend of mine.  I had found this location via the website of kinkos, and lucky me, its right in my part of the neighborhood!  I believe that this location is 24 hours.  They do Fedex stuff, and carry some supplies for your shipping needs, along with copy stuff for anything you may need done.  The service here was great.  I had talked to a gentleman at the counter, and told him what size shipping envelope I had needed.  He walked me over to the shipping area, and said that I could find what I needed here.  When I was done, I paid for the item at the counter, which was reasonably priced and saved me a trip to Walmart for the same thing.  He was also nice enough to give me a Fedex envelope to use in the envelope to prevent the pages from getting bent up in shipping.  I have not made copies or done shipping from this location, only shopped here for supplies and spoke with the associates for assistance.  They do seem to have ample stock in standard supplies, and plenty of copiers for anyones needs.  Plus, the staff here was pleasant and helpful, which is a bonus for me.

I LOVE THIS STORE.  It is by far, my favorite craft store by far. Here's why.  First off, its huge.  I love Joanns ETC/superstores.  Their large, clean, well lit, and the staff here is always friendly and helpful.  The store is well set up.  Fabric is usually in the front, with loads of selections.  Sewing, candles, scrapbooking, stamping, you name it, they have it.  I shop here regularly.  Weather its for Scrapbooking, home decor, fabric, whatever, I feel like I could just shop shop shop!   I like how clean it is as well.  Floors are nice, shelves seem organized and clean, along with everything else in the store.  They have so much product here to choose from, and I think they always seem to have great sales going.  I enjoy it here immesly.  Ive also interacted with the staff here on multiple occasions. Friendly, personable, and definately help me find my stuff or make reccomendations when needed.

I was craving some wafflehouse, and after spending the AM at coffee buzz, I decided to drop in here.  Ive eate at this location before, but not in some time.  The service here is usually pretty consistant.  Its one of the cleaner locations too!  I ended up getting 3 eggs over easy, with toast and hashbrowns.  YUMMY.  Bill was cheap, and I was in and out in no time!  Will most likely return again when I am on this side of town. This location is one of my prefered Waffle Houses!

I like the 50's style restaurants, for some weird reason.  The drive in feature is what actually got me hooked, along with the car hop people that come out with your food.  Yes, I know its fast food.  I can't help it.  Sometimes, a girls gotta indulge, ya know?  When you pull up, theres parking spaces with a menu per parking spot.  You have time to sit and review in your car while you decide what it is that you want.  No pressure waiting in line at a drive thru, espcially if your not sure what you want.  I come here mostly for the drinks during happy hour.  Their half off, and a 44 ounce slush lasts me the rest of the day.   They really do have awesome drinks here, and every day between 2-4 you can do happy hour.  Thats why I come here.  I also think too that they have half priced burgers after 5pm!

I found this place by accident, and I have to say, its a good sub shop.  When you walk in, its not a giant place.  Indoor seating only, and they have a super duper high wall between you and the guys making your sandwich.  For short people like me, its a little intimidating.  Like the size of this place, the menu is not huge.  They have quite a few subs to choose from, hot and cold, each coming in a variety of sizes.  9 inch, 12 inch, and I think a larger one too.  They have the traditional "good stuff" to choose from like roast beef, meatball and tuna subs.  Prices seem worthwhile, and I got a 9 inch roast beef sub and took home leftovers.  Great for a sub anytime, day or night.  reasonable hours and prices, and the staff seemed friendly.  Worth grabbing something to eat on a saturday afternoon, just like I did.

I admit, I'm a Carl's Jr fan.  They have such tasty burgers!!    Anyways, I used to frequent this location more often when I lived down here.  Open early, stay open late, with a very clean lobby area.  Can't complain!

I've been shopping at Kohls on and off for years now.  For whatever reason, the Kohl's here are scattered throughout the valley, and its a bit of a drive for me to get to one.  This one is my "go to" location when I need to get my Kohl's on.  Anyways, they have a full selection of mens and womens clothes, home goods like towels, cookware, jewerly and other stuff as well. I shop here for clothes, and today I was on the hunt for some new jeans here....and I got some on sale! score!  Kohls has a nice selection of stuff and at pretty decent prices...I prefer to get stuff on sale here myself, and its usually worth the savings.  I find that I love their selection of pants for work, and have a nice variety of sizes, brands, colors and styles to choose from.     I do find that sometimes the tops are touch and go here.  I've bought a few tops here in the past and they've always shrunk on me....like after 2 washes.  They shrunk so much that I was unable to wear them any longer.  It's not to say that ALL thier tops are like this, but its something thats happened to me enough that I hesitate before I buy.  Anyways, Kohls is pretty cool, just wish they had more central/better located stores then where they have them at now, but aside from that....Kohls rules!

Back when I first moved to Arizona, I lived in Anthem for some time, and hung out here on occasion.  I absolutely loved it here, but the newness has since worn off.  To thier benefit, theres tons of stores here.  Ralph Lauren, Bath and Body works, Bose, etc.  Great selection of stores!  But, as a regular, it doesn't blow my hair back like it once did.  I love taking my mom here, since she seems to enjoy herself at the outlets when I actually lived in Anthem.  But, now that I live in the SE Valley, I dont see the point in doing the treck up there.  For an outlet mall, its fine.  Clean, well kept, adaquate parking, tons of food to eat in the food court, etc.

I've been with Justin and State Farm since December of 2005.  When I first moved out here, I wanted to change my car insurance, but not to just anyone.  I thought about going with a company that would let me grow and expand with them, and I was willing to pay a decent (but not ridiculous) rate for my car.  I also wanted to know that other services were available such as renters and homeowners insurance as well.  After shopping around, I decided to go with State Farm.  At the time, I was living in Anthem, and after having a crappy (ok not just one) insurance agent in the past, I wanted someone who was professional and knew what they were doing. Justin is my man!    He has several degrees and is the coolest guy I know.  Smart, educated and definitely knows his insurance stuff! I really liked him from the start because he knows what the heck he's doing, gives good insurance advice and won't try to oversell you on anything. He wants what's best for his clients and I love that about him.  He knows all his clients by name and doesn't pressure you into anything you don't want.  He will give you good advice, yes, but he won't "scare" you into anything and I like that about him.  His staff has always been amazing and as I have gotten to know them over the past several years, they've always been personable.  They don't make me feel like I'm "just another person in the computer."  Personal service, knowledgeable and they've gotten to know me by first name since I started going with him back all those years ago.  If you want someone who is an all around good agent (not to stuffy, knowledgeable, personable) please Justin.  His office is in Anthem and I have loved working with him for the past 7 and a half years.  Love love love these guys!

When I first moved out here from Michigan, I lived up in Anthem for about 10 months back in 2005/2006.  Being an avid scrapbooker, this was my store of choice.  Partly because I was living in no mans land, and secondly, because this place is a great store.  This is a great place for all kinds of stuff.  Its owned by a lady who is in and out of the store on a regular basis, and she really knows what shes doing.  Great paper stock, stickers, albums, all the stuff you need.  I like the fact that she also covers a lot of ground with her product.  Not just wedding and baby stuff, but everything you could imagine, in regards to variety.   This place was worth the trip, despite being up in Anthem.  I went here because it had been a while, and I wanted some variety and a walk down memory lane.  Will return in the future, as its worth every mile.

I don't get pedicures often, but I treated myself today since I start my new job tomorrow and wanted to look extra nice.  I came here because I wanted to try a new place, and they are close to my home.  I think that they've only been open for abour 2 years, but I really enjoyed my experience here.  Most pedicures Ive had in the past usually involve someone trying to sell me a million different services that Im really not interested in getting at that time.  I know its part of the territory, but sometimes I want to go in and relax, and its hard when you have an Asian lady screaming at you about waxing/manicures and how horrific your feet are!  (you need pedicure every 2 week!  Feet are bad!  u like a mani? waxing?)  even worse is when they try to sell u flip flops from Vietnam!  ($12 dolla for nice sandals....u like?)  Ugh, fortunately, this was not the case with this salon.  She not only did an amazing job, but didnt try to badger me into a zillion different things.  She also learned me name!  Amazing!  I will be back in the future!  O, and they are only open Monday through Saturday, with Sundays by appointment only.

I've been avoiding this place like the plague, but I had to come here today because I had 2 rugs that were in severe need of washing.  Sadly, my preferred quarter laundromat closed, and this place was the closest to me.  Having been here before, I knew what to expect.  It's a card operated system, where you put the money on your laundry card and run it through the machines as necessary.  The only thing decent here is the prices.  Everything else here makes me want to wash myself in bleach.  The place feels run down, and really needs a serious overhaul.  The machines are older, and there's at least a few that are "out of order" every time I'm here.  Coming in this morning they had a pipe burst, so they were cleaning up the mess when I arrived.  The bathroom is scary, and I don't think they change out the garbage bags.  Yes, the garbage goes out, but the bags seem to always be the same.  If you can help it, go somewhere else.  This place is filthy, and half the time I'm here I can never find an attendant.  I wish they would put a little more effort into this place to make it decent, but apparently its not a huge priority.  What a big fat fail this place is.

I love going to the Library.  It's one of the great things that I think people never really seem to fully take advantage of.    This particular branch is located close to my home. Its not the main branch, so its a bit smaller and has limited hours.  They are closed on Sundays and Mondays, and have a smaller selection of books due to the fact that they are not a main branch.  I know you can request books if they don't have them on the shelf, and it takes only a day or two.  They also have a great little computer section also!  I've come here on several different occasions, and the staff is always friendly and  helpful.  Parking is good, and I can always get what I need.  They even have a little area that have books for sale!  Hooray for the library!

I've come here a few times in the past, and now that Starbucks has free WiFi, I've found myself coming in on a more consistant basis.    I like it here because they have plugs at enough tables that I can sit with my laptop and not be restricted to just a few seats in the place.  Hours are great, and they obviously offer a variety of drinks and pasteries to choose from.  Service is great, and all around a good clean Starbucks.

I came here to this cleaners because I also saw that they did alterations. I had to get a few buttons (clips actually) repaired on a pair of pants that I wear to work. unfortunately, the sewing had come out, and I could not repair them myself.  I dropped them off on Saturday, and they were done on Monday!  I was happy with the quick turn around, as other places have had me wait up to a week for the same thing.  Plus, when I picked it up, the repair was only $4.00!!  YAY!  They offered me to dry clean the pants after fixing my clips, but I passed.  They wanted to charge me $4.25 for dry cleaning!  WTF?  Thats just about double what I pay at my normal cleaners.  So, I passed.  I DO plan on coming back for other minor repairs on pants and other clothing items at this location.  I don't know if they do hems or not, but at least for stuff like buttons, clips and such I like the experience that I had here.  Will be returning!

I like the Good Egg.  Really, I do.  I have eaten here sporatically at a few different locations.  This one gets busy, obviously, but not as busy as the other locations, from what I have noticed.  Anyways, I came here this AM for breakfast.  I was out and about when I realized I was starving. I usually dont keep breakfast food in the house, so I knew it was time to stop.  Came here and the service was quick and efficent.  I was in and out of here in no time.   I had scrambled eggs, an english muffin and hash browns.  Food was tasty!!  I will probably be back.  Rock on Good Egg!

Thrift stores are great for a lot of different reasons, especially this time of year.  Goodwill does a lot for the community, and I try to support them when I can.  This past weekend was no exception.  I had done some cleaning in my apartment, and had a few things to donate.  I wanted it to go somewhere where people would actually be able to use it..and Goodwill it was.  They got a set of my old dishes and a few outfits that I felt were time for me to part with.  As with all other Goodwills, I donated the items in the back to a nice guy, who gave me a coupon for shopping off my next order.    Anyways, I will always be back to my local Goodwill for donating any time of the year!

Considering that I am not spending one dime of my money for this rental, I am quite excited.  This is an older location.  Kind of beat up looking, but planted right in the middle of a few local dealerships, its easy to spot from the road.  Going in, the place looks a bit tired and older.  I have to say, the staff here was FABULOUS!  The guy behind the counter was SO funny, and helped me quickly get in and out!  They even picked me up from the dealership!  Holla!  Staff made this place amazing.  :-)

This is my "go to" QT for gas stations.  I've been coming here as long as I've lived in the area, and I really like it a lot.  The service here is quick and friendly, store is clean, well stocked and has an array of coffee, booze, smokes, and other stuff that any QT would carry.  Gas prices are fair, but sometimes their a few cents more then the rest.  They also have awesome prices on their big pops from the fountain!  hoot!  The only downside to this one, is you have a lot of riff raff that hangs out front from time to time.  There's a few homeless people, and some others that sometimes hang out front that can be a bit, well, annoying.  As long as you don't make eye contact, your good!

I can't believe I'm reviewing a Carls, but here it goes.  I know this is fast food/chain restaurant.  I don't care, cause Carl's is good stuff.  This location is a Green Burrito location, whatever that means, but I think that all it means is that they serve a few Mexican dishes here.  I usually stop here at the drive through, and rarely go into the lobby itself.  I usually order the Carl Star, or as of lately, the Breakfast burger, which is tasty.  Its fast food folks, but in my eyes, anything but McDonalds is okay by me.  I will return for their Breakfast burgers and Carls Star burger any day!

I really enjoyed my experience here at this theatre on Saturday. Located within a little shopping area, with plenty of resturants to choose from.  Theatre was clean, staff was friendly and helpful.    They did have a self serve ticket machine out front to purchase your own tickets with.  I liked that, but the machine wouldnt accept my gift card, so I had to go to the window to use it instead.  Bummer.  Aside from the astronomically high prices of movies this days, everything here was fine.  $9.75 a show?  Yikes.  tells you how much I go to the movies.

Ok, so I recieved a free car wash from my Car Dealership to this place. I  admit, this was my first experience with Full Circle Auto Wash.  I guess they have several valley wide locations, and they are a full service auto salon.    I rolled up on a Sunday afternoon, expecting a ton of people.  Um, there wasnt.  I was a little surprised. Its a Sunday afternoon, the weather is nice, and Im like the only one there. Ok, so I roll up and it takes the guy a minute to come over to my car.  The first guy greets me and asks if I want the stone cracks in my windshield fixed.  No thanks!    Then, the order guy comes to my window, and asks what I want done.  I said that Ive never been here before and only want what the coupon says, which is a free basic wash.  I also mentioned that since I havent washed my car in a while, I have some dirt and breakdust buildup on my wheels, and if they could just make sure to get it all off for me, that would be great.  He told me that they just do basic stuff to the wheels, and if I want to pay an extra $3, they can shine my wheels for me.  I told him I didnt want my wheels shined, I just wanted to make sure that they were clean!   I find that this place is comparable to a Dannys, but they do not have as many valley wide locations as Dannys does.   The car itself came out clean, and the tires looked fine. I was happy with the service, and the car came out lookin good!  I will be back!

After a crazy day of scrapbook shopping, I was in need of something good to eat.  I wanted to get something before I got on the expressway, and I saw this place from the road.  I am a huge sub fan, and knew I had to come in here.  The place is simply decorated, with crab stuff on the wall (so cute) and shiny table tops with a "Neds Subs" design.  Has a sub theme throughout.    The menu here is pretty impressive.  LOTS of variety to choose from, and they are cool with making any order to your liking.  Thier standard sizes are 8 inches and 12 inches, and the prices are fair and reasonable to what I get.  You can also order your sub hot OR cold! Hooray for choices!    I ended up getting an eight inch hot pastrami 8 inch sub combo.  It came with a bag of chips and a drink for something like $7.  NICE!  Food service was quick, and service was great.  I will gladly return here, as I really had a good experience.   Amazing food, great  pricing, delicious and one of a kind.  Worth going here anytime of the day!

Old Chicago is minutes from my apartment, and for as long as I've lived in this area, I've never made it to Old Chicago before.  For my first time here, I really enjoyed it.  It was late on a Sunday night, and both myself and a friend of mine were both craving pizza late at night.  We ended up here because they were open, and I'm glad we stopped in.  Service was great, and they have $3 long islands all day every day.  I'm not much of a drinker, but I do have a weakness for long islands.  We ended up ordering a medium deep dish pizza, and I really enjoyed it here.  They also have Karaoke here Sunday nights from 9-1, which we watched from our dining room table.  They have outdoor seating, indoor seating, and bar seating, which is great!  In between the great hours, drink specials and tasty pizza, I will probably be back.

Saturday night I had pizza on the brain, and Barro's was the first place I knew I had to go eat at.  I've had Barros before, just not from this specific location.  I entered and found that it was setup like the other location I had been at, which is nice!  I went up to the counter and kept it simple with my order..small peperoni to go.  The girls at the counter took my order, and my pizza was done when they had promised!  I had to wait for only about 15 minutes, but thats not bad, and its worth every bite to have a good pizza.  Anyways, I think I finally found my new pizza home!  Any Barros really, but thier pizza is consistant from what I have found between locations.  Its a pan style pizza, and the taste is what I like! Plus, they have a small wine and beer selection, which I like as well.  :-)

I was looking to try something new this weekend, with it being Memorial Day and all.  Searched on Yelp, and found this place.  It sounded really interesting and different, which is what I had in mind when I was looking for a new place.  Found the place and its located in a business district.  I thought it was kinda cool cause its in a warehouse type place.  Not your typical resturant location!  The place is decorated fine.  Um, it gave me a greekish feel becuase there was some leaves painted over the hostess area that made me this way, despite it not being a greek resturant.    I was greeted immediately and sat in the front of the resturant.  It was very early, so I ordered breakfast.  Server was fine, knowledgeable and friendly.  I ordered the French Toast and it was served on cinamon bread.  Holy crap was it tasty!  I ate it really fast and devoured in its delicousness.   I really enjoyed my experience here.  Its more of a homey feel.  Not your typical trendy breakfast resturant, but delicous enogh to gorge yourself on some pretty good food at some pretty good prices.    I can see myself taking my mom here.  I noticed a lot of older people here as well, but then again, it was also like 8:30 in the morning on a Sunday, so I guess all the old timers were getting thier breakfast on.  I will be back!!

After a weekend of cleaning, I had some stuff to donate here at the Goodwill.  I had to get rid of a desk in my place, to make room for other stuff, and thought that donating it would be the best thing.  This particular Goodwill is located in a shopping mall, and is easy to see from the road.  The donation area is located behind the shopping strip, and it states that so you dont actually have to get out of your car and walk inside.  I drove around, and the donation area was quite efficient.  There was a line of cars (I was #4) and there was plenty of people waiting to help you unload your car of stuff.  I waited for my turn, and the nice man unloaded my stuff for me!  Afterwords, I went and cruised the store.  They seem to have regular sales on stuff, and a garden variety of items for sale.   Mens and womens clothing, Lamps, household items, ETC.  I gave them 5 stars becuase A) they serve the community to those who are less fortunate then us.  B) the donation area was efficient C) giving back is important.

I have to say, its so nice to find what I consider, a great family resturant.   They have a great menu selection, and the atmosphere is relaxed and warm. Great family dining.  Being that its an italian resturant, I feel that they serve all of the great traditional italian food, with out the "chain resturant" feel.   Calzones, Pasta, pizza, salads, etc.  Great full menu, with lots of selection!  They also seem to have quite a variety of wine to choose from as well!!  I love it!  Now mind you, I only had a greek salad when I was here, so my experience with eating off the menu was limited, but it was tasty, none the less.  Its a great casual enviroment, and the resturant seems to be well kept and clean.  Warm, friendly staff members, with a lovely atmosphere.

I was in desperate need of a pedicure, and was on the hunt for a new nail salon.  It was late in the day, and wanted to try something new.  This place is open 7 days a week, and until 7 PM Monday through Saturday!  (6PM on Sundays.)  The staff here was awesome! They totally put me in an awesome mood, and were so upbeat! Chatty, funny and all upbeat!  After a long week at work, this really lifted my spirits!  I went with the full service pedicure for only $30.  Pedicure, leg and arm massage, hot rock masage on my legs and feet, legs wrapped in hot towels with mint lotion, along with my feet getting scubbed!  I'm so relaxed right now, and aboslutely love this place.  Happy service, great prices and a wonderful, relaxing pedicure.  :-)

I really love Pita Jungle.  My first experience was at the one downtown, and now, I have to get my fix.  I found this location since it is close to my home, and wanted to check it out.  Upon entering, I was pleased with the location.  Well decorated, clean, good lighting, ample seating.  I was greated by the hostess, and sat at the bar.  The place was pretty busy, and I was by myself.  I was greeted in a quick manner by a nice server from behind the bar.  I took a moment to review my menu, and decided to skip a full meal and go for some lentil soup.  Now, here is where things get dicey.  I won't hold it against Pita Jungle, but I have to put this in the review.  First, after being seated, I noticed that it was a little toasty in there.  I think they could have turned up the A/C.  I am sure if I had been drinking, I probably would have broken a slight sweat, as it was warm in here.    Secondly, after I ordered my lentil soup, it took what seemed like forever to get it.  I did not time it with a stop watch, but it took a long time for just a bowl of soup.  Secondly, when I did get the lentil soup, I didn't care for it.  It looked kinda gross and didn't taste all that great.  And, in case you were wondering, NO, I didn't send it back or complain.  I was to tired and didn't feel like being a sourpuss.  The other problem that I experienced, was the server girl brought out my check WAY before I was ever served my food.  I hate that!  At least bring my bill with my food, not before!  Aside from that, I dig this place.

I have frequented this place quite a few times, and its okay.  The things I like about it are the late hours, "free" internet as long as you buy a drink and the indoor and outdoor seating.  What I don't like is how they now regulate the internet.  When you purchase a drink, they give you a reciept for only 3 hours worth of internet service.  It's not that I personally need more then 3 hours of service at one time, but why regulate the Wifi?  Maybe its to stop people from camping out and hogging up space or something, I'm not sure.  The staff has always been nice to me, but I'm only there on average about once a month at best, and its usually to take advantage of thier late hours.

Dry Cleaning here is great.  They do an excellent job, and only charge $2.25 an item.  Plus, if you have your stuff in by 9 am on any day, its done by 4!  Sometimes, I get coupons in the mail for $1.75 on any item, any amount, and they honor it no matter how many items you have.  This cleaners is located in the shopping complex at Ray  and Rural roads, across the street from Frys, on the NW corner.  They are open until 7 PM every day, but closed on Sundays. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Update:  I still frequent this dry cleaners, but they have raised thier prices to $2.25.  (that's a 25 cent increase.)  They still send out coupons for $2 an item, and I suggest you use them, especially if you bring in multiple items.  Those quarters sure do add up!  Also, when looking for the cleaners, please make sure to look for "2.25 cleaners."  Easy to see from the road, and I believe that they do have multiple locations throughout the valley.

Ok, so I drive by this place every day, to and from work, and have been dying to stop in and check it out.  I admit, I'm not a biker kind of gal, nor am I looking to by a bike anytime soon, but checking out new places IS my thang, ya know??    So, I went in last Saturday and was warmly welcomed by a female staff member who made me feel comfortable right away.  The dealership is immaculate, clean, well organized, and most importantly, NOT intimidating!  I loved it!  I wanted to hang out and socialize!  They have plenty of bikes here to look at and choose from.  They have a clothing section, a pool table and a leather couch.  They also sell harley parts, accessories, and have a service department.  Anyways, after talking with an associate, she told me that if I was looking to meet people, they were having a ladies night on Wednesday.  I guess its a regular thing.  I went to the ladies only bike night, and I was so happy that I did.  They take the time to educate me on what it takes to be a rider.    Even if you are NOT a biker type, I reccomend stopping into any Harley dealership.  Why? Becuase they do more then sell bikes.  They host events, its a great way to meet people, and try to new things.

I love AJ's.  It reminds me of a store back home in Michigan that I used to work at.  Its the Michigan version of AJ's.  So, walking in here, I had a high set of expectations.  I am extremely impressed not only with this chain of grocery stores, but with how they maintain such a high standard of service, goods, and never cease to impress me.    This specific location is like every other AJ's..no surprises here.  Great selection of produce, wine, meat, fish, and quality items all the way around.  Sevice was top notch.  While I was here, I found out that they were hosting a jazz ensamble, with a musician outside.  I liked it.  This place is a little pricy, and good for really specific items.  I would not give up my traditional grocery store for it, BUT, its definately worth adding to the places for your quality produce/wine/meat items.  Worth every penny!

I have been to this Jason's on several occcasions in my day.  It's kind of in a weird location, and basically a pain in the butt to get too.  its immediately before the I-10, so if you miss the drive way, you have to go totally out of your way to turn around.  Anyways, I came here to eat since I was to lazy to cook anything for dinner.  They have huge deli sized portions, and one sandwich easily feeds two people.  My mom and I split a sandwich when we ate at the one on the west side, many moons ago.  Anyways, I think their menu selection is decent.  Large enough to please most peoples pallets, but from personal experience, I don't think thier menus anything to throw a stick at.  It seems that most of Jason's Deli's are set up the same.  Large self seating area, with booths and tables.  They have a carry out section, along with a dine in section.    I studied the menu and placed my order.  The girl behind the counter did a decent job, but what frustrated me was the order delivery/pick up.  While I was waiting for my order, my mom called.  I decided to take the call at a table, and I ended up finding out that my food had been ready.    I guess it was a little confusing since I had a number on my table that they would just walk it out.  I guess I had to pick it up myself.  I didn't like that!  I was obviously on the phone, and the guy saw this.  He called me over, and I had to manuver this heavy tray while on my cell.  Usually, I've had the food walked out!  Anyways, I ended up dining in. I had half the sandwich wrapped, and ate half at the resturant with a tasty ceaser salad.  This place is great for kids, family, friends, dates etc. Just a note, the portions here are GINORMOUS.

I've been shopping at Dillards on and off for years, and I really love coming here for stuff.  They have a really great selection of clothes and other items for men and women, and they tend to be reasonable in their prices.  I came here today for some stuff in the ladies section, and had a great experience as always.  I was looking for a special bra to wear under a dress for an event I have at the end of the month, and the lady working in this section helped me find what I needed.  I told her what I was looking for, and she gave me an idea of what products would work best for my outfit.  She even brought stuff to the changing room as needed.  I've bought other clothing items here over the years, and have always walked away satisfied.  Prices are reasonable, but your better off trying to wait for a sale or find a coupon if they offer any.  They really do have a great selection of items. I really wish they had locations in Michigan but unfortunately they do not.  Dillard's had locations throughout the valley, but some of them tend to be either full fledged stores like this, or more clearance centers as I've found.  It just depends. I do not know why they did this, but the ones that are clearance centers are set up much messier with less organization.  Granted the prices at these clearance centers are rock bottom with up to 80% off, but you have to sort through stuff and hope that you find what your looking for.  Overall this is my preffered location and store for most things I need.  As long I can catch a sale, (which I couldn't this time because I really needed this item) its a great place to shop.

The Good Egg is good for a lot of things, and thats why I dine here.  I usually frequent here for Breakfast, but they do carry a full menu of Breakfast, lunch and dinner items on their menu.  I like this place for a variety of reasons. First, the full menu.  Secondly, they have tons of seating for any sized party, and the location is spacious.  They have branches throughout the valley, but this one is closest to my home.  So far, I have always recieved adaquate and friendly service.  The place is clean, and but not fancy in decor.  Bathrooms are usually in good shape, and if I can get there early enough, I have a little to no wait time.  If you try to go mid morning on the weekends, expect to wait!  This morning I had a 3 cheese omelette, toast and coffee.  I ate at the bar area, which is located in the front of the resturant.  I like doing that because it gets me in and out early.  Plus, since I was dining alone, it was easier then me dining at a table.    I feel safe bringing just about anyone to the Good Egg.  I know both my parents like it, so it is parent proof, along with friends or dates and kids.

I really dig this place.  What a treat!  Everytime I go here, its just so much fun.  The theme of this place is straight out of the 1950's.  I like that.  They have a full menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The staff even dresses like it was the 1950's too!  They have table, booth and bar seating here.  I usually drop in for breakfast, but have eaten lunch and dinner here as well.  I'm sure eating here is probably not the best thing for me, but theres something fun about getting good food that I cannot pass up.  I think its a very unique place!

I dig Michael's.  I go here for my scrapbooking supplies, and other crafty stuff that I may need.  They carry loads of stuff-floral, art supplies, candles and do framing as well.  The store is well organized, well lit, and they are open late!  Plus, they also send out weekly coupons for 20-50 percent off, so make sure you use it!  This place is right off the loop 101, and kind of hidden.  Its right near a pier one, so make sure you keep an eye peeled for it...easy to miss, especially if its your first time there!

I haven't had Chipotle in a while, and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  It's been a while since I've eaten here, so I figured it was time!  When I entered, it was the dinner rush, so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman, along with a UPS driver.  Nice!   Despite the line being painfully long, I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!    I do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly, they were extremely busy, and despite that, I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me, as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.    I also really like how thier menu's set up.  Fairly simple, with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated, easy to understand and a fair price point.  Really enjoyed my time here, and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!

I love Italian food, and this was my first time at a Carrabbas.  I came here with a friend of mine after shopping at Ikea, and I really enjoyed my experience here.  I really liked my experience here. The staff was friendly throughout, from the hostess, to the waiter, and everyone else we interacted here.  Menu had a lot of different options, with a full wine and alcohol menu to a variety of different dishes.  The server told us about the different things on the menu, as we both had a few questions about different dishes that we both saw.  We were also informed that they make their pasta fresh daily, which I thought was awesome.  The bread plate with the oil was Delicious.  We ate 2 baskets worth!  I went with the spaghetti with meat sauce, and a sprite.  I wasn't drinking since I had to drive home, but my friend did get 2 beers while we were there.  My friend went with the meatless spaghetti, and both our dishes were awesome.  We passed on desert since we were both so full afterwards.  I would gladly return in the future, as I had a really good time here.

So, Andrea and I decided to head to Cheesecake Factory for my birthday celebration on Friday night.  I've always loved Cheesecake factory for a lot of reasons, and have yet to find a reason to NOT love it here.  They have such a great menu selection, the decor is always nice, and I love how theres tons of space to dine, socialize and hang out.  Anyways, I got there first so we could get a seat.  It was busy, but thats not a surprise since it was a Friday night.  The girls at the counter were nice and friendly, and told me the wait was only going to be about 15 minutes.  (not bad!)  They gave me a buzzer and I waited in the lobby area for Andrea.  Anyways, I was seating rather quickly, which was nice!  Our server was friendly and cool, and immediately asked what we would like to drink. I got some water, and Andrea got some Iced Tea.  We studied the menu for  a minute, and I ended up getting the shepards pie.  I could really have almost any one of thier dinners here, and find that I will like what they serve me regardless.  I love the variety!    Anyways, I was happy becuase I felt like our server was available, and even tho it was busy, she didnt make me feel like that, and that was awesome!  Anyways, I still love this place and its just awesome.  Great place to bring anyone! Parents, dates, friends, whatever.   I really don't think you can go wrong here.

Ok, so I had to get a haircut.  I could hardly see through my mane, and it was time to get it trimmed.  I have been to this location before, and so far, so good.  I go here for minor things, like trims, and protien treatments.  I have exceptionally dry hair, and find that the moisture treatments are only $10 here, which is awesome. When I need my haircut, with tip, its under $20.  If I get it styled, its under $30.  I go here because I don't always have time to go to the salon, and a lot of times, I just need to get the hair cut so I can see.    The staff here is friendly and welcoming.  You can make an appointment, or, you can do what I do, and just walk in.  Thats what I love about this place.  I can just show up without an appointment, and it takes no time at all.  They also have a great selection of store brand and name brand shampoos, hair products and the people that work there are always helpful in helping me with my selection.  If you need a quick do and are in a pinch, I reccomend this place.  Its great for those "in between cuts" that you get at the salon, for half the price.

I have been to PF Changs before, but not to this specific location.  I dined here on Sunday night, and it was a pleasure as always.  We were seated right away, and the place is pretty big and well laid out.  Had a decent crowd for a Sunday night, and our service was great!  you can actually see this location from the road, making it easy to find, and parking was a breeze.  I ordered the Sweet and sour chicken.  I forgot what my date ordered, but both dishes were good.  I upgraded this time, and got the fried rice...with shrimp!  Food came out in a decent amount of time.  Server was smart, friendly, and did not make us feel rushed.  My serving of shrimp fried rice was HUGE!  Did I also mention that it was tasty?  Sweet and sour chicken was done just right, and it was tasty!  I would definately return here, and was happy with my experience at this PF Changs location.

After a full day of shopping and going out, my mom and my friend Austin were starving! We were down in the Awatukee/Chandler area doing some shopping at Ikea, and decided we needed something to eat stat.  We didn't feel like driving very far, so we circled through the mall to see what we could find.  We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery, but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here.  We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions.  I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus.  It came with white horseradish and was delicious!  My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad, and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries.  OMG food was so good!  Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked, and everyone here was happy.  I would love to come here and drink, as they have an awesome drink menu, but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom, I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here!  I will say, the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside! It was so cold that my mom had to go outside to warm up.  It was quite cold, but I was able to stick it out, but when my mom was outside warming up, so befriended another customer who was outside trying to warm up too!

Holy Cow.  I am impressed.  Yes, I know its "just a Dennys."  Go ahead, make fun. But, I actually loved the staff here.  I went to this Dennys location for the first today, and had the warmest, friendliest experience.  I was greeted, seated, and ordered within minutes!  I sat at the bar, which I didnt mind doing at all.  My server was so attentive.  The staff here is good looking too.  the guys that work here make eating here half the fun.  Cute, cute cute!   For a good Dennys experience, this location is a must do.  Did I mention this place is open 24 hours??  BONUS!!!  Plus, its right near the expressway!  Its kind of hidden a little by some hotels, but you can still easily see it from the road!

Lately, I have found myself reading a lot of books, and was looking to pic up some more reading material for my lunch hours at work.  I had already hit bookmans and changing hands, with no luck. So, I decided to hit borders to see what they may have had to offer.  I've been to this location before, but not in a couple months.   I like borders for a few reasons, but I find that their store is well stocked and the staff is usually really friendly.    I wandered the store, and even though I didnt have a specific book in mind, I had an idea of what I wanted to read.  I like thier bargin book section, and the layout of the store, with overhead signs, and signs on the actual bookstore itself.  Even though I did not purchase anything, shopping here was fun.  Staff was friendly, hours are great, and you can always order those hard to find books that you may need if they dont have them on the shelf.

It was time for a much needed pedicure, and this place is really close to home for me.  I was extremely satisfied with the pedicure that I recieved, for a variety of reasons.  Here's why:  First, they have a really nice clean shop.  The staff there is warm and friendly, not pressuring you into anything you do not want.    Secondly, prices are extemely fair, and I was impressed.  They offer $20 pedicures M-W.  Totally worth it! I love getting a deal!  Lastly, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, the gal did an AMAZING and thurough job!  I was there for at least an hour, while she scrubed, picked, and went to town on my feet.  She really put in a TON of effort, and made my feet look like a million bucks.  This is super important to me.  Ive been to places where they dont put in the time or effort.  This place does.  I will gladly return to this place again, as I feel that they did such an excellent job on my feet, and dont charge a ton to do so.

I wanted to have a nice relaxing meal, and felt that this was the place to do so.    My friend Angie and I entered the location for dinner on a Sunday night.  It was not busy at all.  There was no wait to be seated, and we got to choose between a table and a booth.  While looking at the menu, I don't think its that half bad.  The place is really clean, well decorated, but I felt that it was dimly lit.  It kind of reminds me of a place maybe my grandparents would go, as it kind of has a homely feel.  Like the kind of place you would almost find a bunch of retiree's???  My problems began during dinner.  First, I was a little shocked at how much some of thier dinners were, considering it was kind of a "home cooking" type menu.  Comfort food is served here.  We were debating on appitizers and couldnt make up our minds on what we wanted.  We thought, what the heck, lets get a sampler.  But, the sampler appitizer was more then some of the dinners on the menu.  We passed, and went simple with some spinach dip.  When the spinach dip arrived, at first, it did not look like what we would have expected.  It just looked different.  It had salsa on top!  WTH?  Salsa on top of spinach dip??  Never seen that before. We did not like that at all.  So, we had to scrape it off.  But, when we went to scrape it off, we realized we had no silverware to do so with.  We had to ask the server twice to bring us silverware and napkins.  We were almost done with our dip before be brought it out.  We scraped the salsa off with chips.  We ended up ordering burgers.  We refer to hamburgers as "old faithful."  When you cant find anything else to eat on the menu, burgers are always a safe bet for a solid meal.  So, thats what we ended getting.  I only gave this place 4 stars.  For starters, no silverware, secondly, I really felt like maybe we were to young to be there??  Maybe for an older crowd, but for us 20 & 30 somethings, I just felt like maybe it wasnt a joint for us.

Wow, what a great scrapbooking store!  This place has it all.  Ribbon, paper, all kinds of supplies a girl could dream of.  I believe they have a lab in the center of the store as well.  Great place for the serious scrapbooker, or the beginner looking to get ideas for just about any project.  Definately worth the trip.

I finally made it out to Liberty Market on Sunday!! I really had a good time here, and had a really positive experience. What a great experience.   Upon walking in, I saw that they had a little area selling stuff, like sauces, noodles and a bunch of other stuff. Very aesthetically pleasing to my eye. I really like how this place is decorated. Clean, modern, but understated. Cute! They have shopping carts full of product to buy, such as Olives, and other stuff.   The staff greeted me warmly, and handed us menus. I saw the red velvet cake in the case, but never ended up ordering any. Patrick and I studied the menu, ordered at the counter. The register girl seemed young, and had an idea of what she was doing, but ultimately, never got our sense of humor. We were joking with her, and she didn't think we were all that funny, or was being to serious to laugh. I wont hold it against her, because she was young, but it was entertaining the say the least. Cute.   I cant remember what Patrick had, but I went with the burger, fries, and a drink. We also got an appetizer of the pizza thing with Hummus. Delicious! I love the dishes here too. Totally my style of a place. My hamburger was amazing! Delicious! mmmmmm. I love a good burger!  Service was amazing here for us to. Staff made sure we had a good time and checked on us continuously. I liked that.    I will return in the future!

I've been to this part of Gilbert before to eat at other restaurants in the area, but finally made it to the Farmhouse this morning for brunch.  I've been meaning to come here for some time, but seem to make it after its closed!  My friend and I pulled up for a very late breakfast, and the place was hopping. Its located immediately next door to Liberty market, and there was a line outside waiting to get in.  The place is small, so there's no waiting inside.  Also, when we got here, I found out from another customer that we had to put our own names on the waiting list! I don't mind waiting, but had no clue that we had to sign our own names!    Anyways, it was only about a 20 minute wait or so, but we were starting to get hot, so we finally got a seat in the shade near the misters once the crowd started to thin out.  Inside, the place is small, but the seating seems fair.  No hanging out in the aisles, or else you block the servers!  Despite being crazy busy, we were waited on almost immediately.  No problems there.  Service was quick and efficient, and at one point I think we counted 7 servers!  Menu is full of selection, a little bit of everything.  I went with the #19 omelette, which was loaded full of veggies and cheese. Spinach, cheese, tomatos, etc. It came with some tasty hash browns and two huge slices of toast! My friend with the big john (I think, I can't remember) and he loved it! He also got the chocolate milk and it looked really good.  Anyways, I would love to return as the food was really good and service seemed to be top notch.  The only sucky thing is really waiting outside.  Go here if you can. Seems to be a really original type place.

So, I'm always on the hunt for a good Deli, especially out here where they seem to be non existent.  I saw another reviewer talk about this place recently on yelp, and thought that I MUST go check it out.  I can't believe I've lived here for 7 years and never heard of this place. How is this possible?  Anyways, Scott W and I came here and I really liked it.  I think its probably the best Deli that I've had since having moved here.  For starters, they have a really great full menu. TONS to choose from, and a small deli case with some side items in there to choose from.  Some of the things that won me over about this deli are the following. For starters, they serve Beet Borscht.  This, my friends, is by far one of my absolute favorite Jewish dishes.  My grandpa and grandma would make this from scratch when I was growing up, and bring it over to the house when I was a kid. It was always a treat to eat, and I haven't found anything as good since.  There's a few deli's in Michigan that serve it, but nothing out here that I would recommend.  I didn't get a bowl of it here, but the fact that they serve cold beet borscht is going to make me come back and visit again.  Secondly, they have real gefilte fish!  They serve it by the piece here, and it looked like it was supposed to look in the case...large with a carrot on top.  This, my friends, is the way to my heart.  In regards to my food, I really enjoyed my brisket sandwich.  I got it on challah with a side of fries.  Really really good, and it came with au jus sauce. I was able to plow through half the sandwich, and brought the other half home for later.  It was also a really a good sign to see other Jewish grandmas in there when we ate.  As someone who is not only Jewish, but has a high bar for Jewish food expectations, this place is awesome. I do plan on going back in the future for more, as I was really happy with my experience here.  Plenty of seating indoors and out, I really wish they had waitstaff instead of ordering from the counter.  This is a million times better then Chompies any day of the week, and I will gladly drive back here in a heartbeat to get more food.  Solid place, worth the drive.  Go check it out if you want good Deli done the way its supposed to be.

Being the nice Jewish girl that I am, I love good Jewish food.  Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food.  Its not the greatest deli I have eaten at, BUT, I think its the most authentic deli that the valley has to offer!   The portions are huge, wide selection of food, deserts and deli cases.  They also offer Holiday dinners for those of you who may be Jewish and not have family out here to celebrate those holidays with.  I reccomend it!  They are quite expensive tho!

So, it was time for me to stock up on bras.  I wanted to go get properly fitted, as I think every girl should at some point in thier lives.    This place was great!  It's located right in Scottsdale, in the same shopping complex as Saba's Western Wear.  Its a small little boutique, cute, quiant and comfy.  It really felt like someones home.  Pink walls, lots of bras, and other odds and ends for women of all sizes.  This place caters to ALL women of every shape size and color.  They carry a full line of support for women who are full busted or not, along with post op breast surgery stuff as well.  They carry a full line of product.  They will even special order stuff for you.  On Saturdays, they are only open between 10-2, and closed on Sundays.  They advertise as being by appointment only, but you can walk in and shop just like I did.  I was greeted by a young lady who was professional in every way.  I asked her a lot of questions, and she was able to answer every single one for me.  I told her I just needed a few every day bras, nothing fancy or exciting.    She had me step into a fitting room, and measured me for size.  She brought in a variety of bras, and I tried on each one to see what I liked best.  To my delight, most of the bras in the store were all reasonable in cost to what I would spend elsewhere...between $40-70 dollars.    I should also mention that the measuring was obviously at no charge.  I was so thrilled to actually have someone who knew what they were doing during the entire session!  No pushy saleswomen, no bad information, no trying to upsell me on a bra I didnt want or need.    I also found out that they have a location in Tucson, and that has been around for about 50 years, and thier Scottsdale location has been around for about 15 years.  Quite impressive.    This place was totally what I needed.  Real service, by women who knew what they were doing, no pressure to by and I actually learned A LOT while I was there about bras and such.  Some of it I already knew, but some was new to me as well.  Give this place a try.  I think you'll be impressed, and be as happy as I was with the experience.

When I moved to the valley, I sold a lot of my furniture, with the exception of neccesities, like my bed.  Well, it was time for a new bedroom set.  So, I had done some shopping around, and the roomstore seemed to carry a lot of stuff that I like.  Thier prices are reasonable, they have a huge selection, and every time I have been in there, the staff has always been friendly and professional.  I ended up purchasing a really nice bedroom set through them, and they had it here in no time.  They even knocked a bunch off for buying a set, and I had it delivered in no time.  Staff was friendly, professional, courteous, and they seem to have an amazing selection of stuff.

I came here on a whim while trying to find another business in the area.  I love places like this because you can almost always find something that you like.  The selection here was nice.  Staff was friendly and helpful.   Great clothes for work or going out, and the prices seemed fair on thier clothing.  Decent selection, nice stuff.  I know its resale, but I found stuff hard to find that was my size.  I would gladly return as I had a good experience here!

I finally made it here yesterday for the first time in forever, and boy, did I miss it.  This is one of Fry's signature stores, and it is awesome!  They have EVERYTHING!  The store itself is huge, and has a ton of in house services.  They have a seamstress with a dry cleaners, a coldstone creamery, starbucks and a bunch of other stuff here too.  Full wine section, sushi bar, kosher section, electronics, FULL deli, and so much more.  I love the full service stores because it makes grocery shopping fun.  TONS of selection, prepared foods, and so many options.  It dwarfs "normal" non signature stores because its got a ton more stuff.  I find that I am more productive with my grocery shopping here because after seeing everything they have, I get better ideas of what to make, cook and do at home.  Come shopping here just once, and you will see just how awesome this place is.

On my way to the Yelp book club, I stumbled into this lovely consignment store.   Its probably one of the better ones out there.  Everything in here is quality!  You cannot go wrong in this store.  I was very impressed.  For starters, walking in the store is very well kept.  Its very clean, organized and very well put together. It doesnt have that salvation army stink of moth balls and dust.  This is clearly a shop for the more discriminating customer looking for qualtiy clothing.   They sell mostly womens clothing, but they also sell furniture and other household goods.   They had a copenhagen entertainment center that the gentleman said was about a year old.  The entertainment center was obviously well taken care of.  I found that they have a great selection of womens clothing.  Prices are fair, but also what I would consider a little pricier then other stores, but again, thats becuase everything here is in excellent shape,.  I looked at thier purse section, and they had a bunch of coach and prada bags and wallets for sale.  ALL were in EXCELLENT condition.  Impressive.  The prices on the bags were fair, at about $129 for a nice sized purse or bag.  Considering how much you would pay for those guys full retail at the store, I'll take it.  While I was there, I was talking with a very nice gentleman, who I think may own the place.  He was very professional, and had a thick NY accent.  I told him that I loved his store, and that the clothing selection and store setup was impressive.  He said that he is fussy about what he brings in becuase he only wants certain items in his store.  They are rather discriminating in their stock, which I liked.    If your a consignment shopper like me, and would love to pick up a few nice outfits for work, or need stuff that will be a sure fire hit when entering, I strongly reccomend this place for you ladies. Weather its nailing that job interview, or just building up your wardrobe, your pretty much guarenteed to walk out with a few nice items.

Oh, finally a Wendy's with some decency!  I've eaten here at this location on and off for the past few years, and today was no different. I was on the way to the Arabian Horse show at Westworld, and my stomach was grumblng-loudly  I came in here to have an early lunch before I headed into the event. This place over the years has always been one of my favorite locations because their always consistent.  Food is hot and ready, staff is friendly and the dining area's always clean.    Today I went with the combo # 1, and it was out in no time.  Bathrooms were well stocked and clean, and the condiment's were well stocked. I will say I like this location more then others. Kind of buried in the shopping center, but its clean and nice just about every single time I go here.  Oh, and their new breakfast's?  AWESOME!

This place is located right around the corner from my fabulous apartment.  I like this place for a few reasons.  First, it has really cheap gas!  They also have free air for your tires!  The parking lot/gas area is nice and big, so you can easily manuver your vehicle around without to many worries.  The inside and outside of this place is nice and clean, comparatively speaking.  The place is well lit, and carries a nice variety of drinks, snacks, and the staff here is CLEAN and friendly also.  I think QT does a great job of keeping this place clean, and the staff is great here.

Finally stopped in here while out running a few errands myself.  Place is small, but seems to have a great selection of bagels, lunch items and some drinks like coffees and such. I came in here for a bagel and cream cheese, and it was tasty.  Not the fanciest place in the world, but far better then Einstiens.

Arizona Mills is a large Outlet mall. It's huge!  I was there yesterday and it was jam packed full of people.  Some of the things that they have here are an IMAX theatre, resturants, and lots of stores.  I like it here becuase they have a bass shoe outlet, and I can get my sandals for cheap if I catch a sale at the right time.  I have not had a bad experience here yet, but I think its actually a nice mall.  They have a huge food court, and tons of awesome stores to shop at for most price ranges.  There's even Valet!  I reccomend this place for locals and travelers alike.  Big, beautiful mall with loads of awesome shopping.  I felt that it appeared to be a well taken care of mall, at least from the parts that I encountered.  As a side note tho, it is usually a very crowded place.  Please be mindful if you have people with you that may not handle larger crowds,such as elderly or smaller children.

Ive realized after living out here for a while that Frys Grocery stores fall into one of two catagories.  The haves and the have nots.  Either they are updated, clean and look like a million bucks, or they are run down and depressing to shop in.  I prefer to shop in the remodeled new and nice ones.  This is one of those stores.  Its a bit of a drive for me, but I like it due to it being modern, so I trek the extra mile to get here.  Plus, they have a Bank of America branch in here, which is convienient for me!  This place has everything.  Deli, meat, household goods and everything a guy or gal could want.  Will be returning on a regular basis!

I occasionally stop into this Goodwill from time to time, and its probably my least favorite location.  I never find much of anything worth buying, and the selection seems to be poor here.  Most times I walk out empty handed, despite there being a store full of stuff to buy.  Sadly, not my preffered location, but still good to do a donation at when I need to drop stuff off.  If you want to have a better selection of stuff to buy, choose another goodwill.  Limited selection of stuff to by across the board.

This is my first time here in this establishment, and so far,  I realyl like it.  Great coffee menu, lots of small ticket items to eat (bagels n such) and prices seem to be great!  Lots of table and walking space so your not crowded or stepping over other people to get to your table.  They also have free wifi, which is great!  They also have some local artists stuff for sale here, along with some pretty stained glass windows that add to the relaxed atmosphere.  Amazing hours here as well!

Now that I've been coming back here for quite some time off and on, I feel qualified to write an updated review.    Postives: *Open 24 hours on the weekends *drink menu is priced accordingly, with good drinks to chose from  Negatives: *The internet connection here is AWEFUL.  SLOW doesn't even begin to describe it.  The staff just kind of shrugs it off, and I am left holding the ball trying to check email on a connection slower then dial up.  *Bathrooms are outside the coffee house.  Sometimes its locked and you have to get a key.  This also means that if you brought a computer, you have to completely walk away from it, and trust that it will still be there when you return.  Eh, yea, no not my idea of what I had in mind.  Seating is decent, but not every table is accessable to a plug for computers.  Again, limiting and annoying to say the least when I want to sit and check email for a period of time.

I hate giving this place such a poor review, but over all, I wasn't all that impressed.  I came here last night for dinner for the first time, and I can't say that I'm really interested in going back any time soon.  I was hungry, and wanted something different then the usual. I've driven by this place a zillion times, and figured I'd give it a try.  I went in and paid the $11.50 for a plate of food, and I really didn't like it all that much.  I built my own dish, but the meat looked really weird, and the bowls that you put it in were somewhat small.  The selection was meat, pork, chicken and fish. I went with the meat.  I topped it with a few veggies, some sauces, and the cook threw it on the grill. It came out fine, but the meat was just weird.  It was shaved, and was kinda tough.  Veggies and toppings were fresh, but limited.  More salad topping stuff then anything else.  Tomatos, cucumbers. carrots, celery....weird (but healthy) selection.  I was hoping for more variety there.  The staff here was friendly and helpful, I will give them that.  Place looks like it might have been an old fast food joint at one point?  I guess Im just not overall impressed, and had better experiences with Mongolian style cooking.  Sadly, this was not one of them.  :-(

I have been in here before, but today was different, as I actually had some shopping to do.  I was making some chili (which came out delicious by the way) and needed a few ingridents that I could not find at my normal grocery store. So, I came to Sunflower to try it out.  this is kind of like a whole foods market.  One of these natural places, with a decent selection of items.  I circled the store and ended up at the meat counter.  I needed to get 2 pounds of ground beef for my chili.  I was at the meat case and but really wanted to get it from the counter where the butcher weighes out the ground beef for you instead of the prewrapped packages in the case.  So, I go to the counter and talk to the guy aned he says they don't sell just ground beef from behind the counter.  Prewrapped meat only!  really?  WTF is that all about?  Lost a star for that.  Customer service seems to be fine here, as I had good service otherwise, and the store is clean and neat.  A little to granola for me, but it seems good for the occasional stop and shop.

Boston Market, is well, Boston Market.  But, I like it, and thier food is good, chain or no chain.  I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars, but decided I would up them to four stars, since thier food tastes pretty good.  I went here for Thanksgiving dinner, and the service was wonderful.  People were friendly here, considering that they are stuck working on a holiday serving others thier holiday dinner.  Place was clean, but the Turkey was kind of dry.  BUT, it beats that over processed crap your going to get anywhere else.

I like this place.  It's tucked in a Bashas strip mall, NOT facing the road.  I found this place when I was running some errands, and thought I would give it a shot.  Ok, so I like it here.  Free wifi, cute layout, indoor and outdoor seating.  Seating is limited, in the sense that its a lot of two tops or a few 4 tops, but nothing for a larger group, like lets say a random study group or whatnot.  They serve pastries, and I purchased one.  The girl at the counter said that the WIFI was free, but they wanted you to make a purchase, which is a reasonable request.  The drinks, in comparison, are priced more at a starbucks level, from staring at the menu.  prepare to spend $4 on a mocha, and $2.50-$4 on a pastry.    It is quiet in here, no music. But, some people need that, and if I was studying, I would want it quiet in here as well.    This seems like a great little spot.  I have not tried the coffee, yet, but its SO much better then getting starbucks!  The girl who helped me behind the counter seemed to know her stuff.   I like that in a good coffee shop-staff who know thier stuff!  What I do NOT like about this place is the lack of bathrooms.  There is one bathroom, but you have to physically cut through the "backroom area" which is ugly and unkept looking.  Its kind of like back in the old days when you were a kid and had to cut through the stock room at the grocery store to get to the bathrooms. I was not impressed with the bathroom situation, and even though the bathroom was clean, I didn't like the fact that I felt like I was using a staff bathroom.  Not cool.  So, support your local shops and come here and enjoy.

Being that this place is in the same shopping center as my usual coffee shop, I drive by it constantly. I kept telling myself that I needed to come here, but it always slipped my mind.  I finally staggered in here on Saturday and am glad that I did.  The place is simply decorated.  Nothing fancy or exciting, just a standard pizza joint kinda look.  I sat down and took a look at the menu and was happy to see the variety of not only pizzas, but sandwiches and pasta as well.  I was personally looking for pizza myself.  The thing that I liked about their menu is the variety of pizzas that they have...not a "typical" or "traditional" menu in my eyes. Its not so far off the map that its its impossible to find something that you like, but they have options like "sauce optional" and veggie type pizzas which I think are cool.  I went with a small invidiual 7 inch pizza with pepperoni.  Its Chicago deep dish pizza and yummy! I also want to say that the service here was amazing!  My waitress really was excellent, and I will be back for that alone!

Recently, I purchased a new fish tank for my apartment, and was ready to stock it with fish.  In the past, I've always gotten my fish from family stores, as I feel that the stock is better then going to a chain, and I prefer it as well for a variety of different reasons.    I seem to trust the local family run fish stores more then the petcos (or any other large chain store) when it comes to actually purchasing fish.  I find that thier much more knowledgeable and trustworthy, and seem to have a larger variety.  I chose this place because they were open on Sundays.  I had never been here before, and was thrilled to find that this place was local and family owned.  Prices are fair and the selection on fish was HUGE.  They have equal amounts of freshwater and saltwater fish, ranging from goldfish all they way up to stuff that I've never seen or heard of before.  They also have reptiles, and a few small animals such as rabbits and ferrets to chose from as well.  I was really impressed with this place.  I had a bit of sensory overload walking in, just from the huge selection and everything to look at.  All kinds of fish food, reptile stuff, cages, tanks, equipment, chemicals, anything you could imagine, they seemed to carry it.  Service was friendly and nice, and I will gladly be back for more!

So, now that I have a new apartment, I had to find a new dry cleaners.  I was looking for something close to home, that was reasonably priced, and had good hours.  Yay for Del Rey cleaners!  This place is located in the same shopping complex/parking lot as Ted's Hot Dogs.  The actual name on the outside of the business is "2.25 cleaners."  This location is independantly owned, and the owners appear to have 3 locations total, this being one of them.  I like this place for a variety of reasons.  First, they are open to 7PM every night.  Secondly, if you get your cleaning in before 9AM, you get same day service, and can pick up your clothes after 4PM!   The location is clean, neat, and smells great!  So far, I've always been waited on immediately, so not much of a wait or having to stand around.   Great locally owned cleaners with great prices.  I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5 becuase they are closed on Sundays.  :-(

This past weekend I took my pants in as usual to be cleaned.  Well, when I went to go pick them up, I came to find that they had lost my pants!  Not good.  The guy behind the counter searched high and low and could not find them.  I had just dropped them off that morning!  Where could they have gone?  Anyways, it was late on a Saturday and I told them I would call Monday to sort it out.  The dry cleaners actually called me first!  The manager Luis called and sorted everything out. He was extremely courteous and professional and handled my problem well.  They are covering the cost of replacement pants, and cutting me a check for $45 dollars for the cost of the pants!  Anyways, I am still upset that a pair of pants was lost, BUT the service, and efficiency of how my problem was handled was very professional.  Now, I am off to buy more pants!

I actually found this guy on Yelp.  I purchased some sandals last fall on sale, and unfortunately, I needed some extra holes punched in to them because they were hurting my feet.  I had tried to exchange them at the store, but because it had been so long, I was unable to do so.  I was encouraged by the store to find a local shoe store to just get holes punched into the straps to accomidate my situatation.  So, I find this guy on Yelp.  I called in advance to see if he would be able to help me.  He said he could, and that he was open until 3.  So, I race over there, and he punched the holes in my sandals while I waited!  wooohoo! I was so grateful!  He charged me 50 cents a whole, times 4 holes for a whole $2!  This is great!   The store itself is small, but organized and rather clean.  They sell all kinds of shoe stuff, and do all kinds of repairs not only just to shoes, but luggage, zippers, etc.  He says he's been in business for 16 years now, and to keep coming back.  Good experience for something so simple and mondane.

I've been here several times before, and Friday was no exception.  Its in Black Canyon City, one of the first places you hit once you leave Maricopa County.  Its a cute little place, with all kinds of little knick knacks to shop for.  I didn't buy anything while I was here, but it is a cute stop for little stuff.  Its also attached to a cool resturant too!

I came here yesterday after wanting to come here for some time, and am glad that I finally made it.  This zoo is way out on the west side of town, out in the middle of literally no where.  Its worth every mile of the drive, as the place is huge and has LOTS to see and do.  I spent $29 dollars on admission, and that got me into the whole park.  The place is huge, so make sure to get a map!  They have an extensive bird display, all sorts of wild animals, and a wonderful new aquarium.  Some of the animals were a sight to see, and you could almost walk up and pet them.  I was actually able to pet the Lllamas, and got up close and personal with a few other of the animals in there as well.  They have a wonderful bird feeding station that you can go in and feed the birds apples and they will come up and sit right on your arms and head.    They have wild howling dogs witch I found so cute and wonderful to listen to, a Girraffe feeding station, lions, Emus, all sorts of deer and some of the ducks and birds wonder about the grounds as well.  I got up close and personal with Peacocks as well! The exotic birds and parrots are really pretty!  They also have a Koi pond and a beautiful aquarium as well.  The aquarium is part of the park and does not require seperate admission.  They have sharks, lobsters, all sorts of coral and see life here as well.  You can even go up and pet the stingrays as well.  Make sure to eat before you get here, as theres really nothing  close to the zoo before you arrive, and some of the food is pricy at the park. I made the mistake of not eating before I arrived, and had to grab a $4 hot dog after getting in since I was way hungry.  They do have a nice sit down resturant here in the park near the entrance & aquarium, but its a little pricy to just grab a bite to eat at.  They have a little snack shack that sells hot dogs and nachos, but its going to set you back a few bucks for medicore food at movie theatre prices.  Regardless of what side of town you live on, take the time to come here and visit.  Its not the most glamorous zoo, but it is quite extensive and worth the trip.  I drove 40 miles each way to visit here, and I would gladly go again.  Also, bring a few dollars in quarters so you can feed the girraffes, as they have little machines that sell you girraffe food for 50 cents for a handful of food.    Its grate for kids and adults, and I consider it on the list of things to do in Phoenix that to me are worth the time and money for what you get...

I've been coming here on and off for the past few years, and I have to say, I absolutely love it, for a million different reasons.  Why and how you ask?  Here, let me make a list:  Pros: -Plenty of shopping, more upscale, outdoorsy mall with plenty of places to shop and eat at.  They have the cheesecake factory, zinburger, true food, capitale grille and several other places to eat and hang out at.  You can eat for $10 or $100 a person here.....no ones excluded! You don't have to break the bank to enjoy a good meal.  -easily walkable with plenty of shopping.  Sacks Fifth Ave, Polo, and plenty of other stores to wander through for all budgets.  Some places will have price tags that make your eyes pop out, and others are more affordable that won't hurt your pocket book.  -You can park here and walk across the way to the Harkins theatre which is AWESOME!  As long as you don't park in the hourly parking, you can shop, dine and grab a movie all in one afternoon, at the same place, without having to move your car.  The harkins theater is one of those dine in theaters, so you can even eat there!  I know you can park closer to the theater in a garage, but you can also park in the back  end of the Biltmore, take a short walk, and save a few pennies on parking if you'd like, along with get some much needed exercise.  CONS: -The only MAJOR downside to this place is the parking situation.  When I started coming here, it was not like this, but they changed it about a year, maybe two ago.  HORRIBLE.  The parking situation has become a serious turnoff to me.  I think they've always had valet, but the front part of the parking lot (facing camelback-in front of the cheesecake factory) is now entirely a pay by the hour set up.  *some* of the restaurants will validate for 2 hours of free parking if you ask, but if you eat, hang out and do some shopping, I can see how spending slightly more then hours here is possible.  Or, if you eat here, walk around and then go to the Harkins theatre across the street, FORGET IT.    I noticed last week that if you leave your car there for more then 4 hours, its something ridiculous like $16!!!  If you validate, you may save a few bucks, but your still going to pay out the nose.  Lost ticket?  $16!!!!!!     The only "free" parking is in the way back of the mall.  You have to circle around the Capitale Grill, park in the poverty section, and then walk through the mall area to get where your going.  If your in a time crunch, you will most likely want to do Valet, or just pay the stupid fees.  I've come here to eat lunch, and you can't find a place to park.  You can only hope to either get validated, or pray that you stopped at the ATM before you got here to pay your way out.  I have an hour lunch, so I don't really have time to circle to the back, park, and walk through the mall.  I wish they hadn't done that.  When its hot outside in July, and I'm going to the cheesecake factory, I sometimes regret coming here because of how they screwed up the parking situation.  Overall, I would recommend this mall to anyone.

I really don't know how to properly review a Savers.  I mean, its not Neiman Marcus, nor is it a Dillards.  Anyways, I have been in here a few times because I have needed random things for a variety of home projects.  I guess Savers carries a lot of used clothing like the Goodwill would do, along with new items as well.  The reason I like it here is because, well, you can actually not only donate to a good cause, but you can find stuff for you house that maybe you wouldn't want to pay full price for at a retail store. I've been here a few times and scored a few things that were of benefit to me!

Ok, so I shop at Christown mall sometimes.  Or is it Spectrum mall?  Does it really matter?  I admit, I've heard a lot of different things about this place, but it wasn't until I actually moved North of this place that I started coming here on a regular basis to run errands and get stuff done.   Lets be honest, of course there's other places to shop in town, but I think it's also fair to say that this place will never be Scottsdale Fashion Square, but then again, not everything will be.  The pros:  I think their trying to make this place better.  There's a really nice Target, movie theatre, Costco and a few other shops that seem to have brought a cleaner, nicer environment to being here and a few places to eat in and out of the mall that are a okay.  There's nothing fancy about this place, but there's enough of a draw that I find myself here weekly running errands.  Yes, it's a weird mall, (and I really don't consider it a mall, as more of a shopping center, but hey, that's just me)  The Cons:  I think the weakness is the few stores inside the mall that seem chinsy and the dirty wall mart that make it sad.  Like I said, its all about perspective here.  (never gonna be a Scottsdale fashion square) but its a heck of a lot better then shopping at Metro Center.  (and their trying to bring business back in, at least in the outer circle not the inside of the mall itself.  It's not that I'm to good for some places, but it's a real weak stream of small places that seem more geared to a crowd of teenagers, but hey, that's just me.  I know s this mall only has so much potential, but I feel like some of the random stores between Costco and Wal-Mart really don't appeal to most people.  I still come here for the big box stores and a few others, but this place is a solid 2 stars, sometimes 3 depending on what kind of experience I have that day. I also like that the Costco food court is open to anyone and located outside of the store in the food court area versus inside the store where you have to be a member to eat there.  Big bonus points for that alone.....

This may not be the biggest, baddest library in town, but it sure is a fun clean branch. I've been coming here on and off for the past two months, and I really like it here. It's tucked away in the back of Christown mall, out of sight to most, unless you know it's here.  Cute, quaint and always friendly, I really like it here.  The benefits of coming here are there's plenty of parking, place is well staffed, they have an ample amount of computers to use and tables to sit at with plenty of room to spread out.  They have a great selection of books, and the staff for the most part is helpful and friendly. Their closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hey, that's okay, there's plenty of other library branches open if you need to get online or check out books.  If you can't find something here, the librarian will look it up for you and have it sent to the library itself. I haven't done it at this branch yet, but have asked since I'm always looking for random materials.  Bathrooms are clean with limited stalls, and there's a security guard here, so no need to worry.  There's a small kid section in the back, along with a cute little play area. I come here because its cute, small and easy to get in and out!  Overall not a half bad place.

It's no surprise that I saved review 666 for Monetelano Apartments.  It started off so nice here, but by the time I moved out, I was so upset with them, I don't know that I can give them the 5 star review I had wanted to when I first moved in and lived here.  I found this place on the internet and fell in love immediately.  Well run community, all the amenities I could have asked for at an amazing price.  They have a wide variety of layouts, and their prices are fair.  They have 4 different layouts for the one bedroom apartments, and I went with A2 out of the 4.  678 square feet, private patio with a storage cabinet, huge walk in closet, wood floors in the kitchen, totally remodeled with a microwave, built in bookcases on the first and second floor and a fireplace if you lived on the third.  I fell in love and decided to move in after visiting the property.  Mind you, I came in two months before my lease was ending in 2012.  My lease was up at the end of March, and I came in at the beginning of January, so I had more then enough time.  I put down a deposit of $100 to hold a second floor apartment because I didn't want to live on the third floor, or the first.  By the time it came for me to move in in March, they didn't have a second floor apartment, and I got switched 3 different times.  Finally, they found a first floor apartment, but only after I had to stay an extra month at my old place, pushing my move to the end of April.  I feel like I wasted the $100 deposit for my second floor apartment since they not only kept reassigning me, but I ended up on the ground floor, neither of which I wanted.  So, I move in. I fell in love with my apartment, and everything was going fine.  After living here for about 3 months, the problems started.  My toilet flooded the apartment 3 TIMES.  Yes, I had 3 serious floods in my apartment.  The carpeting was ruined, they had to get carpet cleaners out to suck out the water that went into my kitchen, living room and bedroom.  It would happen randomly, and it was always when I wasn't at home.  I was PISSED.  I had to throw out my new rugs in the bathroom and kitchen because they were ruined!  They told me they would not reduce my rent or offer to replace the rugs since I had renters insurance, and basically told me that they had done their part to clean up the mess and I was on my own.    Secondly, when it came time to move out, I felt like I got screwed.  They tried to charge me for the damage to the carpeting from the floods, and after some going back and forth I finally got the charges waved.  I knew I would owe something, but not $1000.  The move out was totally where I lost any respect I had for them.  I take responsibility and acknowledge that I would owe something (like two to three hundred dollars) but not $1000!   They said they had pictures, but they lied and did not.  Then they said that there were red stains on the carpeting, which there wasn't since I had pictures.  After emailing the assistant manager Mindy, and looking at the carpeting receipt, they were charging me for repairing the carpeting from the first flood where they cut it up.  Mysteriously, the charges were "only $341 without the carpeting repair.  I found out later that the cause of the floods was because I lived on the first floor and tree roots were growing around the outside sewage line, and every couple months the lines would choke the sewage lines,  causing flooding in my first floor apartment. It also happened to the guy who lived next door to me as well, so it wasn't just my apartment.  Here are the benefits of living at Montelano: -close to the light rail, which their extending up 19th Ave -your in central Phoenix, so you can commute to just about anywhere in the city in less then 30 minutes. -affordable with lots of amenities, plenty of layouts to choose from, and its mostly a well maintained community -two well maintained pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, workout room, business center -assigned parking with the option to tow if someone takes your spot.  The office will give you a tow card and you call the company to get the car out of your spot -reasonable pricing -full sized washer and dryers in the apartments  Downsides: -the water bill here ran on average of $50 a month! I was in a one bedroom and was like WTF!  I know some of the two bedrooms water bills were well over $60 year round! -office staff is friendly until you move out, so beware!  -The assistant office manager is NOT a nice lady, and will try to screw you any way possible.  Please, go over her head to the property manager as she is an irrational cunt. -when you try to reason them, they will use the "we're trying to cut you a deal and if you go to corporate, their going to REALLY screw you" routine.  FAIL -several residents have had a hard time with management here, not just me.  Others have had similar experiences.

So, I wanted something to eat this morning, and the thought of coming made me decide to go out to eat instead. I'm tired of blowing up the kitchen, so I decided to come here instead.  This place is located off the service drive of I-17, smushed in between some hotels and next door to the outback steakhouse.  When I arrived, the parking lot looked kind of full, and I thought "oh great, there's going to be a wait-what did I get myself into?"  Fortunately, I was seated right away.  The host was friendly and outgoing, and the waitress gave me a menu and offered me some drinks.  I reviewed the menu and decided to order the Cinnamon raisin french toast, and let me tell you, it was delicious!  Three pieces of french toast, with some home made jelly jam tasted awesome!  The place is cutely decorated, with bench style seating, and there's more then enough places to sit.  I was thrilled that I didn't have a wait on a Saturday morning shortly before 10AM, because as you know, breakfast places can be packed at times like this.  They also have a lunch menu as well, which seemed really appetizing.  Bathrooms were clean, and overall, it was a really good experience.  Prices were fair, as my french toast only cost me $7.53 after tax!  I see myself coming back in the future, and this place is definitely worth a try if your in the area for breakfast or lunch.  I think they close at 3PM, so make sure you get there earlier in the day.

I came here because I was craving Chinese and didn't feel like going to Panda Express. Wanted something quick and close, and I've eaten here one other time, so I gave it a shot.    The food is okay, and the place try's to present itself like a Panda express.  They have crab Rangoon, and it's set up where you can get a variety of different things. The food is okay and the prices are good, but the last time I came here the service was awful.  The guy was filling to go orders while a line grew like 5 people long. I didn't mind, but he was sorta crabby when he waited on me and I had to tell him I wanted orange chicken like 3 times.  The food was okay, but nothing spectacular.  He also had a hard time making change when he rang up my order.  My bill was $6.77, so I gave him $10.02 so I could get $3.75 back. He was confused and tried to say something back to me.  The other lady working came and helped him figure out how to ring up my order.  I don't mean to suggest that he's stupid, but after his crappy demeanor, and now he can't figure out change, maybe waiting on people isn't the best idea for him.  Overall it was okay. With all the light rail construction, I went here because it's literally across the street from my apartment, and I wanted something quick. If you want better Chinese, go to panda express.  The food isn't bad, it's just not great...and questionable service as well.

I love the Goodwill, and this store seems to be one of the better ones I've been to out here.  Place is clean, well stocked and really organized.    I seem to find a thing our two when I'm here, and today was no different. I got a pair of Chico's dress pants for $12.99, and usually find other random odds and ends when I'm in here as well.  They have the usual clothing selection, along with some furniture, kitchen items, household goods and a few other goodies as well.  Overall, I like this location and it's on my list of places to check out.  Some of the other goodwills aren't as nice, but this one's worth a stop in. Staff is friendly and helpful and you can find just about anything here.  Go check it out!

I love coming to this home depot!  It's not to far from home, and they have an awesome nursery. I've come here for a variety of things over the past year, and most times, I can find it.  The store is laid out like every other home depot, with just about all the same products you can think of. Lumbar, paint, hardware, etc.  I've done a lot of shopping at their nursery, and the plant selection is quite nice.  They have a lot of annuals, but could probably step up their perennial selection plant wise. They have a huge selection of dirt for planters and gardens, buckets, planters and all kinds of gardening tools.  Inside they have tons of stuff to choose from.  If I have a problem finding something or need help, I can grab someone in an orange apron to help me figure it out. Staff is really friendly and helpful, which is great.  I will say, the downside is that if you come here in a Saturday afternoon, sometimes it can be crazy.  I don't mind the crazy atmosphere, but sometimes its hard to find help if you have questions.  Even though the staff is friendly and helpful, they seemed to be shorthanded sometimes, which can prove frustrating.  Here's an example, but it's happened more then once to me.  I was in the nursery last summer and had questions about some plants.  It was busy and I was trying to get assistance to figure out what plant would do better on my patio.  I asked the register girl (who was working in the nursery) and she said she didn't know that much about plants, and needed to call someone to help me.  The guy came out, but ended up helping 3 other people and never got around to helping me.  I stood there for 20 minutes with my plants thinking he was going to come back until the register girl asked if I had gotten the help I needed.  When I said no, the guy came back out, apologized and assisted me with my plant questions.  Was it resolved? Yea.  But this has happened to me more then once. I think they may just need to hire more people, especially for help. I mean, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable for the most part, but when its crazy, it can be hard to get in and out of the store quickly especially when its 110 degrees and you are roasting.  Overall, I'm satisfied with coming here and really enjoy shopping here.

Finally made it to this Harkins to c.atch a movie today and get out of the heat.  I actually kind of liked it here!  The chairs seem a little old, but they have two levels, the place is clean and have a snack bar if you want some goodies.  You can also eat in the food court attached to the mall if you don't want to pay an arm and a leg for popcorn, which is pretty cool.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and the place seemed pretty busy!  This theatre is two levels, which I thought was kind of cool.  half upstairs and the other half downstairs.  The only thing that sucked was the escalator going down was broken! You could go up, but not down.  So I waited with some other people for the elevator which took forever.    Overall a decent theatre.  I catch the mantinee's, and the staff seems to be pretty nice.

I've been coming to this library on and off for the past few months since I moved into my new apartment.  I started coming here in the fall to check out books, but found myself here a lot after my computer died in December.  I got to know some of the features of this library, and I have to say, this is one of the nicer branches I've been too.  For starters, its located in the mall circle of Metro Center Mall.  Yes, I know what your thinking, why would I want to go there? Well, its the closest library, and its not in the mall itself, just in the service drive!!  (leave your bulletproof vests and guns at home for this one, okay?)  The library has two floors, and is pretty modern in layout and technology.  Lots of computers for kids and adults, meeting rooms, and a bunch of other cool stuff to boot.  They rent books, movies, CD's and have several other services here as well, including english classes and a few others.  You can rent a room for like $5 an hour if you want to have a cool meeting spot as well!  The staff here is pretty friendly, and will help you with just about anything.  I've had to ask the librarians before for assistance, and they haven't failed me yet.  Membership here is free, and you can get a card on the spot if you want to check something out.  Also, they have self checkout which is pretty neat as well, and you can renew stuff online if it's easier for you do it that way.'s   The internet here is pretty quick, and there's like 25 or 30 computers to use here, but they fill up quick on Sundays, so get there when they open.   If your desperate, you can put in a PC reservation and get the next computer if you have to get online like I did.  Also, if you need a book or DVD and they don't have it at this branch, the librarians will look it up for you and tell you what branch you can pick it up from. Pretty cool, huh?  The library also has security guards here as well.  I don't know why, I mean it is Metro Center, but who know it could be such a rowdy place? LOL  There's one security lady that I see, and she's a bit snippy, BUT there's a hot security guy that works here, and we constantly make eyes at each other, so he's cool.  We keep checking each other out, so I guess its just a matter of time...(get it? checking each other out like books at the library?)   HAHAHA  Anyways, I gave an extra star for the sexy security guard, so it's all good!!! O, and if you go there have fun! Their closed on Fridays but open every other day of the week!

So, my neighbor invited me out to dinner at the last minute and suggested we go here. I haven't been to a Red Lobster in ages, and wasn't sure what to expect.  Yes, I've seen the commercials, but the last time I think I actually set foot in one was around the summer of 1997.    Anyways, we came here and I have to say, I actually had a really good time.  The place was pretty busy, with lots of families and couples dining here having a good time.  We started out with the hot spinach, artichoke dip that had some seafood in it. That was pretty good, but was super duper hot!  Dam near burned my mouth! lol.  For dinner I went with a trio plate, that came with a lobster tail, some barbequed shrimp on a stick and some shrimp in a lemon butter sauce.  Surprisingly it was all really tasty!!    the rice was a little under cooked for me, but it was okay and I only took a few bites.  The salad was good and they also had some great biscuits before we had our meal that I liked as well.  I also treated myself to a margarita and I liked it. It didn't seem to have a lot of booze in it, and kind of tasted a bit weak in my opinion.  more booze in the drinks please!!!  What really made my night was the service we got.  I loved our server! She was awesome!  I can't remember her name, but she was so good, that she would make me want to come back because she really paid attention to us.  My neighbor forgot his phone and we were standing outside the truck talking and she even walked it out to us!    Thank you Red Lobster for leaving a good impression on me. I didn't think I would have had such a good time here.  Maybe I should come here more often....

So, during December my computer died not once, but twice!  The hard drive went out on it, and after trying to get it fixed by a friend, I finally accepted that it was toast.  I wasn't really prepared for this to happen, as I had anticipated it lasting another year before replacing it.  But, such is life, and I guess it was time for the computer to go.  Mind you, I've never made a major purchase from Fry's electronics. I've been here in the past  for smaller purchases, but nothing more then here and there. Being that I was in the market again for a computer, and since things have changed since I last purchased a computer several years ago, I needed to refresh myself with what was out there.  (not just computer wise, but even the retail landscape has changed dramatically as well.)  I did some shopping around at Costco, Best Buy, and after a friend accompanied me here, I decided that Fry's had the selection and price that I was looking for.  I came in for my purchase on Wednesday night, because their New Years sale was ending. I was down to two computers that I had my eye on, and figured it was time to purchase before the sale ended.  The guy who helped me was awesome.  Total tech guy who totally new his stuff.  I was impressed with his knowledge. I showed him the two models that I wanted, and asked him which one would be better for me.  After explaining the differences, he said that either model will do me fine for a laptop, and that the $50 price difference was really up to me. He said that the cheaper model was the way to go, and that for $50 LESS I was not going to see a major speed difference for what I was getting.  He went back and grabbed the computer and had it at the register after I finished wandering the store.  He also told me that if I purchased Microsoft I could get it for $89 instead of the $120 that it would cost me if I waited until the 60 days ran out and they charge you. I said that I'm not a huge word user, and would pass.    He was really educated and filled in a LOT of blanks for me that I couldn't have filled in myself.  I had a really positive experience here, and I feel like Fry's is the new Best Buy for me.  Plus, even though Costco has great prices, your on your own with buying and hoping its every thing you need. Plus, I've found that they rotate stock a lot at Costco and what you see today may not be there in a month. (trust me, I tried. The computer I had my eye on in early December there is not for sale through them anymore.  They rotated and put out an entirely different stock when I went back to purchase around New Years.  Even tho Costco seems to have a better warranty and tech support offer on their computers then Fry's, their stock rotates to fast and if you don't buy it within a short window of time, you may not get the make and model that you want.  Overall, had a great experience here and I would make another computer purchase from Fry's again.

I came here today on a whim since I really needed a pedicure.  I decided it was time try somewhere new, and this was the place.  Its located in a strip mall right off the light rail on Main Street.  When I went in there was no one there!  It was just the owner lady and another man with her.  Thats fine, it is a scorching Sunday afternoon.  Maybe people are home watching TV??  Anyways, lady was wonderful.  The entire Pedicure took aout an hour, and my feet look great.  The lady and the guy with her were hysterical.  They are both Vietnamese, and they were watching home videos of thier last trip back to Vietnam.  The man was in the video and he kept pointing himself out to me.   He was so funny!  He kept saying "this is me playing guitar!  This is where I sing!"  It was quite funny.  Anyways, I will return in the future for more pedicures.

I've always been a fan of Discount Tire since I've owned a car for a variety of reasons.  For starters, they offer free tire patching, along with a several other services.  I found myself here Friday afternoon because I seemed to have a slow leak going on in one of my tires. I made an appointment online Friday morning at work for later on that afternoon.  I rolled in, and was warmly greeted by one of the techs at the counter.  From what I saw, it seemed like most of the guys here were trained on counter service, which helps out tremendously in cutting down on wait times for checking in.  The service guy took all my info, and came out and checked my car.  I told him I was having a slow leak, and would like all my tires checked to make sure it wasn't more then one.  He checked the car out, and told me it would be about 45 minutes.   The whole thing only took an hour, and all the guys here were warm, friendly and honest.  They figured out that I had picked up a screw in my tire, patched it, and sent me on my way.  Total price? ZERO.  And all in a days work. I will gladly be back for a number of reasons, and Discount tire continues to have my service.

I was hanging out with my mom, and decided that it was time to get some waxing done, as I've seen this place before.  It's right next to the Safeway, and I finally had a chance to stop in and check the place out.  Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by a lady named Tracy.  She told me that she would be with me in just a few minutes.    This salon is normal in a lot of different ways...They do nails, pedi's, mani's, waxing and a few other things as well.  I was really happy to see that her prices were fair, and shes got a very clean looking shop.  I plan on going here again, most likely for a Pedicure and a few other services, as she seems to have done quite a nice job.  Good hours, great location, and they speak good english too!  LOL.

Wow, what a great little spot!  I found this place while wondering around Mesa, and its a cute little spot.  Serve breakfast and lunch.  Great large layout, plenty of seating, and cutely decorated.  Like Michael C said, it has a great little midwestern feel to it.    While I was here, I ordered the chese omlette. Came with hashbrowns, and the food was tasty.  I felt like I got a good amount of food for my $$.  The service was really personal, and that was great!  Lovely little place.  This would be a place that I would come to eat and read the sunday paper, take my mom to, or just spend time at with a good friend, as the atmosphere was relaxed and allowed you to not be overwhelmed with noise or a small cramped dining room.

After having the day off yesterday, I decided to catch up on a few things that I've been neglecting since getting my new job.  One of which was scrapbooking. I came here to grab lunch after picking up some much needed scrapbook supplies, and wanted a bite to eat.  I've eaten here before, but not in some time.  The place is actually pretty good, believe it or not.  Its a small, intimate kind of place, that serves and sells some great breads, along with a few sandwiches to eat in house or carry out.  They have half sandwiches that you can get for around $4.50, with a nice selection of freshly baked bread, along with whole sandwiches for $7.50.  This price includes chips and a drink.  I went with a half sandwich, on toasted white bread.  I really liked it!  Pop was refillable as long as you ate in, and service was a okay.  If your in the area, and would like a really cute, independant place to eat at, stop by and grab a bite to eat.

I am a HUGE scrapbooker, and this scrapbook store is probably the best one I have found here in the valley so far.  The selection here is huge, and the prices are fair and reasonable.  Lots of paper, ribbon, stickers and other wonderful scrapbooking items to choose from.  The staff is wonderful, and actually help you with anything you may need.  If you have layout questions, need help with getting the right ribbon, or just questions in general, they really take thier time to answer the question and help you!     They also have a really good setup where if you put your name in the computer, you get monthly discounts, and an extra discount for your birthday.  I think once you spend $100 with the store, you also get an additional discount as well.  They keep a running total of how much you have spent in the computer under your name,and you get an additonal discount once you've hit your $100 mark.  The store also has a lab as well, and they hold classes regularly.   I think they charge for most classes, but there may be 1 or 2 that are free.  Check with store on the classes and charges.  If you do work in the lab, they will let you run a tab, so you dont have to pay every time you want to get something for your scrapbook.    The store also has scrap night, for $15, which is pretty typical.  Usually run Friday and/or Saturday nights, and its a blast.  Hourly drawings, worth the $$, and its a lot of fun.  Here are the only negatives I could find about the store:  A) They charge $5 fee to use the lab.  I don't like paying for lab time, since most other scrapbook stores will let you use thier lab for free.     B) I like to use the lab to scrapbook.  It gets me out of the house, I get to meet other scrapbookers, and I can get supplies that I need as I work.  Being the working professional woman that I am, the only free time I have to scrapbook is the weekends.  What I DONT like, is that getting into the lab is near impossible on the weekends.  Why?  Becuase when they hold classes, the lab is off limits to open scrapbookers like me.  What this means, is that I can shop, but if I am having a scrapbooking weekend, I can't go into the store, and Im stuck scrapping at home.  If theres a class going on, they will not allow you to go in and scrapbook off to the side.  I dont like that.  C)  They are closed on Sundays!  Argh!   I wish they would have Sunday hours, but for some reason, they dont.

I'm drawn to this festival for some odd reason, even though I don't fit the usual mold for the type of person who's into renaissance type stuff.  My first "ren fair" was in Holly, Michigan many years ago, and I find myself going back when I can because I like it so much.  I've been to this fair once before back in 2009, and had a good time then. I finally made it back this past weekend and had a blast with a group of friends that went with me.  The Tickets themselves aren't cheap, but they get you access to a bunch of activities all day long.  The fair itself is HUGE, lots of shopping, enough shows to watch that suit just about everyone, and tons of side shows as well.  When I was there this time, I watched a few shows, including the laughing nuns (a comedy routine), some belly dancers, a fire eating guy who was pretty good and I also watched some of a Celtic band perform.  The shows are all free and part of the package, which is awesome!  Coming here is like a step back in time.  People dress up in period dress, making it feel more authentic, and the food is quite tasty as well.  Turkey legs, bread bowls, fish and chips along with lots of other things to eat as well here for a reasonable price.  I think the turkey legs were a little over $7, drinks were about $3, and plenty of other food for slightly less then that.  Even if your not a ren fair type person, I think its a blast to go out here and check it out. I would say on the cheap end, plan on spending at least $40.  That's $21 to get in, $10 for food, and another $10 for side items like face painting, etc. They have tons of shopping here, so it's possible to spend more, I just don't feel the need to buy a lot of the items that I see here. They have stuff like candles, tarot card readings, jewelry, paintings and TONS more stuff that you can buy here, depending on your interests and budget.  I love coming here and will return in the future.  Plan on spending the entire day, and wear comfortable clothing and shoes when going. From Phoenix, its about an hour drive (maybe a little less, depending where your coming from) and have a good time.  Oh, and you don't need to wear period dress while here.  Whatever makes you happy!

So far, this is my favorite pool to date.  Its a bit out of the way for me, but worth the drive.  Here's why.  For starters, the only downside is that its buried deep in a subdivision.  I never knew it was there until I did a search on yelp & the internet for swimming pools.  Secondly, this place is HUGE and NOT crowded!  Two entirely seperate swimming areas!  One for the kids, with zero level entry, a water slide and a lazy river.  The "adult" side of the pool is entirely seperate, and Olympic sized! Holy Moly!  Diving boards, swimming lanes, a basketball hoop and TONS of room to move around in.  This place, for once, has ample seating! Tons of chairs! Never a problem to find a place to lay out here! Covered seating is also available as well.  Locker rooms are large and plentiful, with lots of toilets, showers, changing areas and lockers for 25 cents.  I will go out of my way to swim here. $2.25 for adults, and kids are much less.  Go check this place out!

I admit, I'm not much of a sushi connoisseur, but Kona Grill definitely was really tasty! I came here Friday night with a group of people to celebrate a friends birthday, and I really enjoyed myself.  The menu is easy to read with a variety of different options. The descriptions help me order since I am completely in the dark about sushi.  In between the server and my friends, I ordered quite a few plates of different food and all of them were really tasty.  I think my favorite was the Las Vegas roll by far!  My friend and I also split the Philly roll along with a few other dishes as well.  They have some really strong chocolate martinis, and overall I had a really good experience here.  I think I like it here for a variety of reasons. For starters, its easy to order if your new to sushi like I am.  The server will help you if you have any questions, and I found the food to be really really good.  Not that other places are bad, but it can be overwhelming if you have no idea what your doing like me.  Also, they have plenty of stuff with out avocado in it since I think its one of the most disgusting foods in the entire world.  (I know some people will give me slack about it, but the consistency and lack of flavor completely turn me off and I just think its gross overall. This includes guacamole.)  If your not into sushi, they also have several other menu options such as burgers and sandwiches which I think is awesome!  I know if I came here again I can order just about anything, weather its a burger or a Las Vegas roll and know that I will enjoy myself.  Great menu, service and overall good time. Try it out of your in the area!

So, my friend had a horrible accident at work and put his hand through a saw.  He severed three fingers, and was rushed here for surgery.  The surgeon was able to re-attach his fingers, and he was in ICU for 2 days, and was eventually moved to the recovery area for 3 days, spending a total of 5 days here in this hospital.  While visiting him, I was happy to see that they were taking good care of him.  The ICU here was 1 nurse for every 2 patients, and he had his own room.  They checked on him every hour, making sure his hand was still gaining circulation through his fingers.  The nurses in ICU were really good, and took excellent care of him.  Once he was moved upstairs to the 4th floor, he shared a room with another guy who was pretty cool.  The nurses here were a bit more spread thin, but still gave him the care that he needed.    He was able to get up and walk around as needed, and the 4th floor was a lot busier (obviously) then intensive care.   When I did come here, the general hospital staff was friendly and helpful.  When I came in, there were a few volunteers at the front who assisted me in finding out where I needed to go to see my friend, and they would show me where to go.  The gift shop ladies were friendly and welcoming, along with all the other interactions with staff that I had here throughout my friends stay.  If you visit after 8PM, the front doors are locked, and you have to go through the emergency entrance and sign in with security.  I gave them my ID, they gave me a badge and I was able to walk upstairs to pick him up when it was time to come home.  I like that they have security here, so that way crazy people can't roam the hospital floors.  Well, at least if they do, they won't get very far anyways.  Overall a great experience, and I'm glad that they were able to save his fingers and the staff was awesome.

I love consignment shopping, and I've dealt with My Sister's closet before, just not this particular location. I came up here today to consign 2 blouses and do some shopping since I have a store credit with them.   The staff here was friendly and helpful, as I had questions for just about everything! Consigning was easy, and there was plenty of clothes to choose from.  This store feels bigger then the one I usually go to, and I found that I spent quite a bit of time going through their racks checking stuff out.  Just about everything here's in great shape, and prices for the most part are fair. Tops from $8.95 and up, pants, plenty of shoes and huge purse selection.  I tried on a few things and ended up buying one a cute pink top. The whole process was easy, and I had a blast here. Large, wonderful selection, great prices and friendly staff.  Store is wonderfully organized, and for the most part, and overall good experience. I like that if you trade with one store, your credit's good with all of them, so you don't have to go back to that specific location, which is what I did today.  Your balance comes up in the computer and you can use it if you'd like.  Overall good experience and I will be back!

Was out on a date yesterday, and we had worked up an appitite.  We were on the light rail, and decided to stop off on Mill to find food.  Walked down mill for a second, and found silvermine subs.  SCORE!  I had never been here before but I liked it.  Its not the fanciest place.  Simple location, good food, decent prices.  They seemed to have a good selection of hot and cold subs, with different side items and combo meals.  I got the King Bullion, and it was tasty!  I went with the small sub (5 inches) a large pop and some chips.  Food was up in no time flat.  Seems to be a college kid hang out, especially considering the location.   Would return in a heartbeat.  Tasty, reasonably priced, and right off the light rail on Mill.

I really don't know how to write a review for Food City.  Why?  Because its not always what I expect.  So I made enchiladas this past Sunday, and realized that I would like to have a side of rice with it, at the very last minute.  I figured, that instead of going to Safeway, why not try Food City, so I could get some more 'authentic' rice to spice up my dinner some.  So, I got off the light rail a few stops early at this Food City, and, well, I was dissapointed.  For starters, I felt like this location was dirty and grimish.  More so then I would have liked.  I have been in Food City before, but I feel like they should offer showers upon leaving this location.  Secondly, I went in there and was looking for Rice...any thing NOT rice a roni, or uncle Bens for that matter.  I walked the store TWICE. NOTHING.  NO FREAKIN RICE.  WTF!  I came to food city and you don't have rice?  Thats like me going to Chompies and not finding Challah for Gawds sake.  Unacceptable!  ugh, so I left, and high tailed it out of here.  If I should ever find myself in a food city again, it will NOT be this location.  EVER.

Came here for some Ice Cream on Saturday night.  Location is in a strip mall at the very end.  Location is open late, with a great selection of ice cream.  Staff was fun and friendly, and I will gladly return!

WOW!  This is my first time here at Coffee Plantation, and I am in love!  This place is huge!  After wanting to do something different from hanging out at my "usual spot" I decided to change things up a little this morning.  I ventured out of my little bubble and wandered down here to check this place out.  I admit, coffee plantations a little out of my way...but like I said, I wanted to do something different this morning, and the change has done me good!  Coffee plantation is huge and reasonably easy to find.  Located on Mill Ave in the heart of ASU, its a very large coffee shop, with tons of seating! Finally, a place with more then 2 tables!  LOL.  I love how large and spacious it is.  Full drink menu, and I love thier prices here.  Very competitive, and seems to be cheaper then Starbucks!    The hours here are great too.  Open early (I think the girl said 6AM??)  until late at night, like midnight on the weekends.  awesome!  Free wifi too!  I will be returning here for a variety of reasons.  Great hours, friendly staff, independant with great seating.

Again, I'm trying to mix things up again on my end, and since Gold Bar was packed with no seating, I decided to go elsewhere and get my internet and coffee on.  This place is a little out of the way for me, but they offer free wifi, have great hours and serve donuts!!!!!  Hooray for donuts!  The place is small.  Counter seating only and its limited.  Parking is adaquet, and considering its a Sunday afternoon, an open seat is always a sight to see.  Service here is fine, and their donut selection is decent considering how late in the day it is for these guys. I don't go to Dunkin Donuts often, but thier always there when I need them.  I love the free wifi too!  hooray!  The one downside to this whole thing??  ITS FREEZING IN HERE.  I feel like I'm in a morgue its so dam cold.    Anyways, I will be back!!

I came here for the first time last night to see Fiddler on the Roof.  I never realized how close this place was to my apartment!    The joy of coming here is that the theatre itself is quite large, with plenty of seats to see whatever show may be playing here.  They seem to have really fair prices for tickets across the board, with a variety of seating options, so no one really gets priced out.  The downside, is that the parking here BLOWS, and it can get congested when entering and leaving.  Even though the upper level seats still give you a clear view, they are a bit far away, and I struggled at times with seeing details of the show itself.  Nothing really can be done about it now, but it kinda was a downer.  I would gladly return in the future for more shows at the gammage.  Thank you yelp!

I came here because I was in desperate need of an alcoholic beverage. I was actually trying to find 4 peaks, and ran into this place instead.  I pulled up and noticed that its not like the other places out there.  Colorful, eclectic, with an island kind of feel.  Very open and airy.  There seemed to be a college kid aurora, but I did notice a few adults there drinking as well.  Place is colorfully decorated, with great drink prices.  I guess they serve food too, but I didnt eat here.  Great alternative to your typical place.

I've been a customer of SRP since July of 2007 when I had to get electric service put in my name.  I fell in love with them from the start, and have nothing but awesome things to say about them.    For starters their rates are much better then APS from what I have seen.  They have a variety of pricing options and plans for everyone no matter what your circumstance.  I personally have M Power and wish this feature was in Michigan where I moved from back in 2005.  Why?  because I can monitor my electric usage, and it saves me tons of money.  Did you know that people who use M Power use 20% less electricity then those that recieve a bill?  Why? Because you can monitor it all the time!  Plus, there's no bill!  I keep quite a high balance on my M power machine since electricity during the summer is much more expensive, and the winter months are cheaper on the electric bills and pocket book.  During the summer of 2010 (June through August), I found myself unemployed after getting downsized at my job of 5 years.   I was lost, and worried about finding new employment, and while I waited it out in the summer heat, I called SRP to see if there was anything I could do to save money on my electric bill while I found a new job and received unemployment.  They told me about a plan for people in my situation that allows people in my circumstance to receive a $17 monthly bill credit for up to 12 months while I find a new job.  You don't have to pay the $17 back, and when you go to the SRP machines to put money on, you receive the credit at the beginning of every month.  I did that for 3 months, and even though I keep a high balance it was the peace of mind knowing that they had my back.  (that was a total of $51 over the course of 3 months in electricity credits!  especially in July, thats like 2 free weeks of electric!)  I also had an outage in September of 2010 due to a meter problem.  I had a new M power box at my door within the hour, and a service man was at my door within 2 hours of that!  SRP completely handled the situation, and got me back up and running between the time I got home from work and the time I went to bed. Plus, their customer service people are always so nice and friendly. . I wish other states and electric companies would model themselves after SRP and how they run their electricity business.  So many options with pricing! I also LOVE M POWER. If other states would even pick up something like M Power, we could save so much energy!  Keep up the good work SRP, and you always make me happy!

I LOVE TARGET!!!!!    Ok, now that I have that out of my system, lets review why I love this one so much.  A) its target and they carry everything B) thier awesome C) I want to buy everything in sight, despite the fact that I only came in here to get shampoo D) its organized!  Aside from parking, this is one of the better targets around, but the parking sucks here, so beware.  Go and shop your heart out...

After my rough experiences at other auto parts stores that shall remain nameless, I decided to come here for a change.  Its a little out of my way, but not to much.  I came here because I needed windshield washer fluid for my Jeep before I headed out of town.  I didnt want the usual cheap crap either.  I wanted the good stuff!  Anyways, came in here and everything went fine.  Service was okay, everything here was clean and well stocked, and I got what I needed.  I would return here in the future!!

I don't go to the west side very often, and I wish I had known about this place sooner. I love thrift shopping, and this store definitely has what I'm looking for!  For starters, the place has a wide variety of items to choose from.  Clothes, household items, and other cool stuff too.  Some of the things I've found here in the past are bathroom and kitchen rugs, a nice end table in good working order, t shirts, a decent but small candle selection and some other random items as well.  Prices are great, and they have pretty good hours as well.  I find it's more hit then miss here in regards to finding items that you like. I mean, I usually find something I like or want while I'm here, but I have walked out empty handed as well.  I think in regards to selection, I seem to score stuff here (more small ticket items then large) and I like that.  Today I noticed that they had two really cool looking over stuffed chairs for sale here today, but they were slightly out of my budget and needed a good cleaning, so I passed.  Staff here is mostly friendly, and they don't seem to blow you off if you have questions about stuff. I do find that they could use a better sign system in regards to finding sizes, but that's about the only complaint I have about this place. Oh yea, and they take cards too!  Obviously the store's interior isn't overly decorated, as it's a thrift store, but I have to say, its one of the better stores with great selection and pricing in the valley.  Go check it out, you'll thank me later!

I came up here to Harold's for the first time in a long time, and I'm glad that I did.  I haven't been here in a while, and since the weather's been nice and I have some extra time, I thought I would treat myself to a nice lunch at Harold's.  I forgot how much fun this place is.  I pull up and there's 3 horses parked in the corral that customer's rode in themselves.  Loads of bikes in the parking lot, with quite a few people eating inside.  I went to the hostess station and told her it was just me, and she sat me in the Fireside dining area! I've never sat in this section before! It's a little room off to the side, with linen tablecloth's, a fire place and its much smaller and quieter to sit back here.  I ordered the BBQ sandwich which came with coleslaw, a pickle and had a Sprite as well.  Tasty!  I think my server was Brittany, and she did a marvelous job.  Service was great, food was awesome, and I love coming up here.  I will be back again in the future, as I had a great time and really enjoyed myself.  Keep up the good work Harolds! I love you guys!

I have been to Chase Field before on several different occasions for baseball games.  I've probably gone to more baseball games in the 4 years that I have lived here, then probably in all my years in Detroit.  No one out ranks my Tigers, but my Diamondbacks are a decent team to watch.  I like this stadium.  Its modern and cool.  Retractable roof and walls that open.  Very modern and clean.  They have ample bathrooms, but the stalls themselves are tiny as heck, which I did not like.  I am not a large person, but found the stalls to be rather claustrophobic.  I also like that the light rail stops right in front of this place too.  this means I dont have to park and pay an outrageous amount of $$ to leave my car in the hot sun.  I will say this.  This is the first time that I have sat in the upper deck.  (3rd level.)  I usually sit in the lower level. I was scared at one point because the barriers between you and falling down all that way were minimal. I could easily see myself or someone whos had one beer to many toppling over those rails.  Scary!  I really did enjoy my experience here, and will obviously be returning for more games!

I've heard about this place before via other Yelpers, but have never really thought about coming down here to check the place out.  After having a wonderful lunch with a girlfriend of mine, we decided to come check this place out.  I probably would have never found this place by myself.  its in a little yellow brick building, and I didnt see any signage.  I pulled into the parking lot, parked the car and went inside.  The place was packed!  Its small, and it was wall to wall people. Some on computers, some just hanging out, others were sitting outside socializing amoungst themselves.  There was really no where to sit!  I guess thats a good sign!  :-)  Anyways, from what I could see, the place was nicely decorated.  Went to the counter and placed an order for a cafe ole, and the girl kind of looked at me funny.  I guess she didnt know what that was?  (its half coffee, half steamed milk, FYI.)  A girl behind her told me that they make it different here, or whateves.  ugh, so I ended up with a slightly different drink then I had anticipated.  Slightly dissapointing!  Anyways, I dont know that I will be back anytime soon.  Why? Because this place was to small, to crowded and I would have no place to sit and and enjoy myself.  I know, I know, dissapointing, but for as sheik and as cool as this place is, I usually come in tow with my computer, or at least the intention of spending a while (like an hour) here doing something.

This place is so cool I can't say enough good things.  I don't come to Scottsdale as often as I used to, but I needed to sit down, fill out some paperwork and have a cup of coffee before I went into an interview at the crack of dawn this morning.  I stumbled upon this place completely by accident, and it was one of the better coffee shops I've been to in these parts.  For starters, even on a weekday at 7:30 in the morning, this place was packed! There was a group of bikers (pedal bikes not motor bikes) that had just come in from an early ride all sitting outside drinking coffee and hanging out.  The inside was full of people doing what they needed to do, all professional looking. Clearly, this is the place to be!  I went with an iced coffee and a slice of banana bread to hold my stomach down while I quickly filled out some paperwork.  The staff was friendly and courteous. Despite being busy, my drink and food were ready in a jiffy.  I didn't hear them call my drink order, but the girl realized when I poked my head up from the table that I must have been looking for the coffee she just poured.    Place is nicely decorated, and has a full menu of items.  Pricing is decent, and there's plenty of places to sit, indoors and out.  Bathrooms were clean and ready to use, and overall a positive experience. I think they also have free wifi! Check this place out if your in the area....

Fashion Square is fun for so many different reasons.  Its a huge, well kept mall with tons and tons and tons of shopping!  Plus, the people watching here is one of a kind!  I am normally not a mall person, but this place is a must see and a full exception to my anti mall atttitude.  This mall is very high end.  Tiffanys, future home of Barneys, and everything else under the sun.  I know several people who consider this a destination spot when they come out to visit because of the draw that it has.  They even have Valet!  woohoo.  Anyways, great place to bring your parents, out of town guests, dates, friends and anything in between.  The mall has several amazing resturants inside and out, and a great place to get drinks as well.  This place is bomb diggty!  You cant go wrong with this!  Fail free zone!

I came here after having wanted to try this place for some time.  I love hamburgers, and a good burger is a real treat for me.  Nothing complicated really, just a good well made burger.  When my date and I arrived, we liked the interior.  The place was smaller then I had anticipated.  Very narrow seating.  Anyways, service and menu selections were excellent.  I went with the traditional burger, and my date went with the Panini.  I went with the French fries, and date went with sweet potato.  I loved both.  The excitement of my night was the fries in the shopping cart!!  Anyways, I was happy with my experience here.  I would return, and liked my food.  So did date. Aside from tight seating, lovely place!

I stayed here over the weekend for a holiday party hosted by my work.  The boss put us all up at the hotel, and this was my first time here as a guest.  I have been to this hotel before, but as a visitor only.  Pulling up, the hotel itself is quite stunning.  Beutifully landscaped, with a large circle driveway, its quite a site to see.  They offer valet, but also have parking if you would prefer to bypass the expense.  Theres staff everywhere to help you with anything you may need....from general information, to carrying your luggage, theres staff there thats friendly and helpful to assist you.  I checked in, and it was simple and easy.  I chose the 6th floor for the views, and it was awesome! I went with a queen single bed, and all rooms have patio access.  Bathrooms are luxuriously decorated, I had access to 2 nice robes, a shower and a bathtub as well.  I had a flatscreen TV, along with a desk, couch and internet plug in.  The hotel is large, and you can easily do quite a bit of walking.  Lobby's large and well decorated, and theres dining available here in house, though I found it to be pricy....you'll save a few dollars dining out at desert ridge, but the food here was tasty.  We all had the breakfast buffet at the Blue Sage, and the service and food was awesome.  You have a chef in the buffett line who cooks omlettes, and when we were there, she had 5 skillets going at once!  This place has golfing, a spa and several pools available, but I did not use any of these services....will be back in the future, thats for sure!

I love Famous Daves.  I really really do. This place is AMAZING!!! I LOVE IT HERE!!!!!!  Its good, consistant BBQ, and holds its own against other places in town that I have eaten at.  Full menu for any appetite-small medium OR large.  Food is consistantly good, and filling as well.  Audrey and I came here for lunch today, and it was delicous as always.  We were seated immediately, and pondered over the menu for a while.  I went with the BBQ Brisket lunch sandwich, and Audrey went with the fish sandwich.  Both dishes were tasty, and extremely filling!  I will say, even though I server was VERY nice and friendly, I was surprised at how slow she was with taking our orders, and our food took a while to come out. No points lost, just a side note.  Will gladly be returning for some of the best BBQ in town! I love ya Daves!

Wow! I'm really glad I came here tonight! I've heard lots of good things about this place and finally came here for dinner tonight. What a treat!  It turned out to be a really positive experience, and I had a good time.  My friend and I were seated right away and we decided to sit inside instead of on the patio. Neither of us had been here before, but since it seems to be a popular joint, and we had an idea of what to expect.  The place is an old house turned restaurant, and its really well decorated.  Nothing over done, but done just right.  Our server was real a real cute guy, and he told us all about the menu.  If you want to get one pizza and do half and half, you can do that.  They also have a great wine and alcohol menu as well, and I wish I would have ordered something to go with my pizza.  I went with the dovita pizza, which came with cheese and salame.  Tasty!  My friend got a half and half pizza, but I can't remember which one.  Food was all around good, and service was awesome.  I would love to return in the future as it was a really wonderful experience.  I love you Cibo!!

Since being on Yelp, I wanted to check this place out.   I finally wandered downtown to check this place out, and I'm sure glad I did. Plus, I wanted to meet Thomas.  I checked the website for directions, and found that they were wonderfully accurate.  Central was under construction, so the website told me how to get to the restaurant despite light rail construction.  Very convienient.  I wandered in and was promptly greeted by a nice gentleman. I told him I was dining alone, and he escorted me to the bar area. I have to say, the Fez is well decorated.  I don't know what to call the decor, but its very modern and clean.  I noticed they have cool glass looking things hanging from the ceiling to look like walls to break up the bar area from the rest of the resturant.  Theres also a bunch of light bulbs hanging off to one area, which I thought was cool to look at.  Very hip interior.  While reviewing the menu, I wasn't sure what to get.  They had a great selection of food and drinks, but I wanted to keep it simple since it was my first time here.  I spoke with the waiter who was wonderfully attentive, and asked a few questions.    I finally decided on the American Burger, and boy, was I glad that did!  WOW.  I was blown away.  This burger was amazing!  It was cibolta bread, and had a tasty cheese on the meat itself.  I also believe that the mustard had a little kick to it....but not an overly powerful kick.  It actually complimented the burger!  This was the right balance of taste, texture and flavor that I needed.  This is how burgers SHOULD be made.  Whie l was eating, the server was attentive, and  I didn't even have to mention that my pop was running low.  He quickly walked out with a fresh pop and took my empty glass away.  The water here was also perfectly chilled and made a difference to me, especially in this heat that we have here.  I would gladly come here again, and it was worth the trip downtown from the East Side of town.  This is a great place to take a date, your parents, or just dine on the way to an event at any one of the venues downtown.  Well done, well done!

I've never been to a Fez Foodies event.  I guess I lost my virginity here?  Despite a lot of apologizing and "I'm sorry's" it was the best 2 minutes of my life!  I knew I was in for a big surprise when Chad the server said something about "nuts on my salad."  My heart skipped a beat!  Anyways, I digress.  I arrived promptly at 4pm.  As the evening went on, more people showed up.  Exciting! yay!  Anyways, I skipped the salad for one reason only.  BLUE CHEESE.  Blue cheese is very overpowering in my opinon, and I dislike it.  Is there an option for other cheeses to go on top of the salad????  I dunno.    OMG but the food was amazing!  It was steak, potatos and asparagus.  Asparagus was done correctly.  Not soggy, but not to firm.  tasty.  Potatos were redskins, and I could have made a meal out of that alone!!  Steak was juicy and cooked to perfection!  At the end of the event, Thomas handed out prizes.  I won a tray and a hat. It made me feel very special.  lol.    Thank you thomas!  We were given the option of a salad with blue cheese, nuts

Despite having heard wonderful things about Chelsea's Kitchen, I've never made it in to dine here before until last night.  I don't know why I waited so long, but I wish I had come sooner.  Aside from being easy to find, Chelsea's has a low key look from the outside, but easy to find and spot from the road.  Upon pulling up, I realized that they had complimentary valet.  Nice!  Place is wonderfully decorated without coming off as intimidating, and has a great clean, sophisticated look yet still makes you feel comfortable eating there.  I like that.   I was greeted right when I went in and was waiting for my friend Robin and her mom to arrive.  I waited outside and realized that there's a table for 8 people right outside the front door! I hung out there until Robin and her mom arrived.  When we were seated, staff was warm, friendly and attentive.  Hostess made sure we were comfortable where we sat and the server was right on it the whole night through.  Since I had never been there before, I had a few questions about the menu, and in between the server and my friend, they were able to answer everything for me.  I went with the Chelsea's Cheeseburger minus the Russian Dressing.  Friends mom went with the Wood fired chicken quarter, and Robin went with the Ahi Tuna.  When the food came out, it all looked really nice! Burger was awesome, and the fries were sweet potato (i think) and were excellent.    While we were eating, the guys at the table next to us ordered a steak of some sort, and it was HUGE, and looked absolutely delicous. If I hadn't already eaten, I very well could have gone over there and taken the plate away from the poor guy it looked so good.  I didn't get a chance to see it, but I heard that the patio is beautiful. I was going to go look, but I was so engrossed in my dinner and conversation, that I never got to check it out. Next time I will though.  I would like to say that I wish I had come here sooner. This is my kind of dining establishment, and its absolutely worth every penny you spend here, and worth every mile you drive.

While my friend Austin was here in town, he had wanted to eat at Matt's big breakfast after hearing about it on a travel channel show.  So, we wandered downtown and tried this place for breakfast.  When approaching the restaurant, we noticed that parking was limited.  Mostly sidestreet metered parking.  We found an open meter, and went inside.  The place is really cute from the outside, and crazy small on the inside.  Its more of a simple decor, with orange table tops, and white walls.  We had a small wait, and put our name on the list.  Eventually, we sat at the bar after waiting about 15 minutes in the sun. I ordered a cheese omelette, and Austin ordered a cheeseburger.  Both our food came out, and it was tasty!  Service was quick, and we were in and out of there in less then an hour.  O, and a word of advice.  The bathroom here is located in the middle of the kitchen!  I had "to go" while we were waiting, and I was surprised at the whole thing.  the bathroom is teeny tiny, and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.  Plus, its located immediately next to the grill!  If you can help it, either "hold it" or go before!  Fair warning for bathroom users!

I came here for lunch on Saturday, and was happy with what I had experienced.  Upon entering, I was seated in the front with my guest, and we were greeted by our server.  I did not get a chance to walk around the place to observe it, but I have to say, the service was amazing.  We had a wonderful lady who was probably old enough to be our mom waiting on us.  (thats complimentary.)  She was genuine, kind, and was one of a kind.    I ended up ordering the tuna melt, and could not decide what kind of bread to get.  I asked our server, and she had suggested sourdough, because she said that I would get a bigger sandwich.  Sold!  I enjoyed this place, even though it has more of a bar feel.  its reasonably easy to spot from the road, and our service was excellent.  I would gladly return for lunch or dinner to this place.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is becuase  the interior is somewhat dark, and its more of a bar feel then a resturant feel.  I would see myself going here for a night out for drinks, but the food here was good, and service made it even better.

How can you not like the library?  Especially when its as cool as this one?  Ive been here twice now, and absolutely love seeing the arcitectural masterpeice that it is.  Made out of steel and glass, its a jewel of a place.  Glass elevators, reflection pools, and art throughout the place thats lovely to look at.  If all the libaries were like this, people would come more often.  They have 5 floors, and each one has its own special purpose.  Will return in the future.

I came here for the first time today because I wanted to treat myself to a nice breakfast at a different spot then usual.  I've known about TC's before, but never bothered to go in, until now.  I really liked it here.  It kind of had a country/midwestern feel, with a large amount of seating and a really nice staff.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and the place was packed!  I kept it simple and went with the eggs over medium, potatos and toast, along with some coffee and water.  The service was great, and all the staff was friendly and helpful.   Food was tasty, and prices were good.  I would gladly return in the future, and most likely bring my mom here next time shes in town.  Great little place for breakfast!

I can't believe I waited this long to come here, and regret not having been in sooner.  My friend Austin went to the Yardhouse recently, and said it was good, so we went today for some lunch and what a great time we had!  Upon entering, it has a really nice open feel.  Clean, well decorated, with great staff.  HUMONGOUS beer, wine and alcohol selection! OMG!  They seem to really have it all here for just about anyone!  Austin ordered a huge beer, and we split a pizza with french onion soup.  The food was tasty, and we both walked away satisfied.  What also impressed me was the staff.  We were always getting checked on by someone, weather it was a server, the manager, or the bus boy taking our plates.  Yard house also has a lot of TV's for your viewing pleasure.  Ample space to sit and watch, weather its at the bar, table or booth.  Open space, with lots of elbow room.  No one's sitting on top of each other.  Love it!  I will be back in the future, weather its to this location or another one.  I was really happy with my time here at Yard House, and will gladly return with more friends in the future.

I came here to this theatre at the last minute on the request of a friend who wanted to see a movie here over the holiday weekend. I've never been to this location, and was surprised to see it tucked away off the edge of fashion square mall.  Here are a few things I noticed while attending: A) The theatre is old and small.  Probably built back in the 70's and got turned into an independent movie theatre once the bigger, better theatre was built in the mall.  B) parking is limited and crappy.  good luck finding a spot. I circled for 10 minutes.  C)  The theatre isnt so bad, its just turned into more of a independent movie theatre kind of place.   just 2 ticket windows, and if its busy, the line wraps around the corner.  D) While I was here on xmas day, Every single person here was like 65 and older.  it was ALL old folks!  OMG!  I was the only one not on AARP and retired in the movie theatre!  Not a young hip crowd!  If your looking to hit on people while waiting in line DO NOT GO HERE! Unless if you like a bunch of 75 year old grandpas and grandmas then you've got your hotspot.  I would only return here if bound, gagged and dragged by my hair!

I had such good food here tonight, holy cow!  I came here at the last minute because I was stuck in the house all day today, and needed to get out and eat something.  I decided to come here, and even though it's not my first time, it's probably the best BBQ I've had in a while.  When I first moved here, I used to drive by this place a lot, but being that I lived on the East side for many years, I was to lazy to come here since it was .  Boy, what a to far!  Man, this place was packed tonight!  I had to circle the parking lot like twice just to get a parking space! once inside, I was seated almost immediately at the bar.  After looking over the menu, I went with the Brisket sandwich with mashed potatoes. It came out right away, and man, was it good!   Service was awesome, especially since it was so busy. The bathrooms were pretty cool with big steel sinks and pretty hand soap containers. I will say, I don't get the club thing attached to Bobby Q's, but there was a ton of people in there. I noticed it when I came in, but saw a lot of people in there when I went to the restroom.  They had a sign up with a dress code, and I'm not real sure what that's about, but seemed interesting enough.

Ok, so if IKEA was a man, I would marry it.  Its probably one of my favorite stores to go shop at.  I admit, I love organizing.  I love putting stuff in cute little containers, neatly on shelves, and am probably the most over organized person at home you will ever meet.  So, walking into Ikea is like a dream to me.  Obviously, the store is HUGE.  laid out in sections, with all kinds of designs to give you MORE ideas on how to decorate your house.  When you enter, they do have store maps, so that way you dont have to wander around if your looking for a specific section, like couches, or bedroom stuff.  Upstairs there is a lovely resturant.  It opens early, and they serve breakfast!  Tasty food.  I have eaten here for breakfast before, and they have a regular breakfast and a supreme breakfast. I just get the regular, and its pretty filling.  The coffee is tasty!  Also, if you dont want a breakfast meal, I believe that they have fruit cups, cinnamon rolls, and other side items to eat as well.    If you go there, definately have a plan.  If you just want to wander around, thats fine too, but I think its easy to get lost.

I came here with my mom this morning for breakfast for the first time and we both really enjoyed ourselves.  We had never been here before, and both really enjoyed the experience here.  The place is small, with very limited parking, but I think they offer free valet from what I heard.  I'm kind of between 3 and 4 stars for this place, but decided to round up since it really is one of a kind and quite enjoyable.  When I go to places like this, I tend to hold the bar high, and expect a little bit more then the usual, so please bear with me while I do some  venting AND complimenting.  After going inside the place was really cute and well decorated.  Plenty of seating with lots of stuff to shop for!  I did find the ordering to be a bit confusing, and somewhat irritating.  You go to the register and place your order, and their supposed to call your name, but we sat there for a while and never heard anything.  I finally went to the counter and I guess our food had sat out there for a while and no one ever told us! No one called our name, nothing!  Plus, they just left the food on this table to get picked up, and anyone could have taken it without us realizing it.  Also, we were extremely thirsty and were looking for water and asked when we went to place our order.  They said that there's water glasses by a complimentary water station in the dining area.  The glasses were tiny, and there wasn't any ice!  ggggrrrr. It's hot here and we're THIRSTY.  Plus, that area is really tight, so we had to make like 3 trips to get water since we were dying.  Ok, now for the compliments.  The food was awesome! My mom and I really both loved our experience here, and the english muffins were delicious! My mom even bought a pack to take home with her, as she really enjoyed the food as much as i did.  I went with the eggs rancheros, and it was so tasty! I had never had it before and boy, did I clean my plate on this dish!  Fresh fruit came with it to, and the english muffin was tasty with what appeared to be home made jelly.  My mom went with some pancakes, I think and she loved them as well.  Overall, a tasty place and I would gladly return in the future!

I've been coming to this farmers market for a while now (about 2 months) and its just okay.  I walk through it most times, and for the most part, aside from the strawberries, I really don't see anything here that appeals to me.    They have some of the usual things here, mostly a lot of produce, which I think is from one big vendor, and a few small others.  There's tables set up that sell cheeses, soaps, tamale's, pork on a stick, hummus, dressings, a lady that sells knit stuff, and a few others in there as well.  The produce setup seems cool, but I really don't buy it, for whatever reason.  There's a guy that sells bread, but its $7 a loaf.  $7?!?!?! NO!  I can get quality deli bread anywhere else for half that!!  I also feel that some of the vendors are a bit pushy.  I try not to make eye contact, otherwise their down my throat trying to sell me stuff I don't need.    I come here out of convenience because I work right there.  Seen better farmers markets in my day...

I've been wanting to try Organo's for a while now, as I love a good pizza.  My friend and I hit this place on a Sunday afternoon, hoping to grab a good bite to eat.  Upon entering, I liked how the location was set up.  We were told there would be a wait for a table inside, or we could sit immediately outside or at the bar.  We really wanted a table, so we waited in the lobby area.  About 10 minutes later, we were escorted to a nice booth.  We reviewed the menu, which had a huge selection of not only pizza, but pastas and subs as well.  Quite an impressive selection.  We couldn't decide on a pizza to split, so we each got our own dish.  My friend got the Ravioli, and I got a steak n cheese sub.  The portions were huge!  Plus, there was not a tremendous wait for it either.  Anyways, I really liked this place, and would return to eat thier food again.

Ok, so I finally found this place!  Tucked away in a little strip mall across from some car dealerships, its a great little find.  I noticed that they have great hours here, open early and late at night as well.  The seating here is great.  Could accomidate a group as long as its not super busy, and they seem to have a decent menu of sorts.  I really like this place, and the guy at the counter who helped me was nice and funny.  Worth a stop to grab some coffee, read the paper, or surf the internet.

After reading about this place here on Yelp, I decided it was time to wander into this marvelous establishment once and for all, and check it out.   I was in the market to purchase a book, and thought why not wander in here to see if they had it or not.  I arrived, and immediately I fell in love.  Warm, clean enviroment that had lots to view.  I got lost in the front half of the store with all of the cool stuff that they had, with the cute magnets, funny tins for change, candles and knick knacks for sale.    I wandered to the back of the store where the books were and was happy with the selection that they had.  Organized like a traditional "big box" bookstore, everything was easy to locate and appealing to the eye.  I ended up going to the service counter in the back to see if they could locate the book that I wanted, and was helped by a nice guy who not only paid attention to what I was saying, but walked me to the area that my book should have been.  Unfortunately, they did not have it in stock, but I was told that it could be ordered if I was interested.  Staff was great, store is clean and organized, and I was happy to see that they sold more then books.  Its also attached to a wildflower bakery if you would like to grab a bite to eat or drink.  I ended up grabbing a muffin and sat in the back reading my own book that I brought with me for the Yelpers book club at the end of the month.  This place is worth going out of your way for, and I highly reccomend it.  Great independant location.

This resturant is part of the Ranch Market that it is attached too.  I have been wanting to dine here for sometime, and finally got a chance to roll in and dine here.  For starters, this is as authentic as it gets.  There is a courtyard area with outdoor seating and shopping.  Colorful, traditional hispanic/latino/mexican culture shows here, and you feel like you've been taken to another country when you walk in.  Colorful is an understatement.  rich deep colors run through this location, along with beautiful traditions of hispanic culure cannot help but to seep into your bloodstream.  In the courtyard area, there is a grill that the staff cooks on.  Women are in traditional hispanic clothing, and look beautiful while they cook.  So much fun to watch, as they make tortillas, chicken, etc and be taken in by the action at the grill.  As you enter the location, you are greeted by the hostess, and taken to your seat.  Beautifully decorated dining area, with a bar area, solid wood seating for parties of any size.  Servers are all dressed again in the traditonal latino dresses, and while I was there on a Saturday night , there was also a mariachi type band playing.  They have a good selection of food, from Enchiladas, burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa.  I ordered the shredded beef burrito.  The serving was ginormous, and HOT when the food came out.  Even though we were seated immediately, there was two large parties dining ahead of us, so we had somewhat of a wait for our food to arrive.  Thats okay, because we were so entertained with the mariachi band, it passed by quickly.   The food was delicious!  Portions were huge, and I took home enough leftovers for a full meal the next day.  you will NOT go hungry while dining here, and the atmosphere is contagous.  You cannot help but to get caught up in the moment, with the beautiful colors, music, and lively atmosphere at this place.    I reccomend this place for everyone, as i think its one of the more "one of a kind" establishments in this town.  You cannot help but to have a good time while eating here.  An amazing place for locals and visitors alike.

Went here with my mom on Christmas Eve, and I really liked my experience here.  Resturant was clean and well decorated, and this was my first experience with PF Changs.    We had made a reservation for the two of us, but showed up early.  I really liked how they validated our parking out at the garage for a whole 2.5 hours!  Yay!  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and egg drop soup.  Tasty!    Service here was excellent.  I loved our server, who was friendly, marvelous, and educated on the menu.    I would go here again in a heartbeat.  loved it!  I do think this place is a little overrated in some senses, as  some kind of local Phoenix hotspot, but for what its worth, I did enjoy my time here.

I really wanted BBQ last night, and wanted to try something new and different. Came on Yelp and found this place.  Its in a cute little part of Gilbert, and around several other resturants in a nice part of town.   Parked my car and went inside.  I loved the decor!!  OMG!  HUGE, spacious, very open and pleasantly decorated.  Plenty of seating!  Menu is front and center, and very easy to read and make sense of.  You have several options and dishes to chose from...I went for the small selection of the Beef Brisket in sauce, with 2 sides.  I did the beans and corn.  They also have a little station in the middle with BBQ sauce, onions, peppers and such.    The line itself kind of has a boston market feel to it.  You grab a tray, and place your order with the gal behind the glass.  She scoops your food for you, and passes it underneath the glass.  Take your food to the end of the line, pay, and there you are.  They have 3 different seating areas.  In the resturant they have seating, with booths and benches.  The second seating area is picnic tables in an air conditioned garage type area.  You actually have to go through a set of doors and sort of leave the resturant to get to this part.  The third seating area is picnic tables competely outside....no covering, no AC.  yea.  Not for me.  I like eating indoors!  I would return to this place, but my only true complaint is the drink station.  In order to refill your drink, you must cut back into the line to get to the drink station.  BAD IDEA!  I can see people getting fussy and annoyed and think your taking cuts when your really just trying to get more Dr. Pepper.   They need to have a second station somewhere so people can refill their beverages and NOT cut back into the food line to do so!  Big pain in the butt, and I docked them a full star for it.  This place is plenty big enough to throw a second beverage station somewhere in the layout of the store.  I will return here for eating again, as I did enjoy my experience.

I have been here a many times, and am pleased with the selection that they have to offer.  Mostly clothing for men, women and children, along with a nice household selection.  Stuff here that I have found is usable, in good condition, and cheap!  Located close to the I-10 expressway, visible from the road!  Not much for furniture here, but I think it makes up for that in regards to thier other merchandise.  I don't go here as often as I would like, but I reccomend for any looking for anything decent and affordable.

Came here last night with a fellow yelper and it was both of our first times here.  I've heard great things about the Vig in the past, and have been meaning to stop in for some time.  The Vig is really a great little spot.  Plenty of seating, with a full bar and menu.  Staff here is awesome, and I love the way the place is decorated.  Enormous patio, decent bar seating, and plenty of great people watching.  Menu has a variety of options, and we went with the Artichoke dip with chips.  I stuck with a resling wine, and it was great.  There's TV's at the bar, along with plenty of space to move about.  Place has a great feel, and I would gladly return in the future.  The parking here is a bit tight, and I did valet for only $3.  If you don't want to do valet, you can park across the street in the lot and stroll across.

Cabela's is awesome!  For starters, no, I'm not a hunter or fisher, but I do love stores like this for a variety of reasons.    First and formost, you don't have to be a hunter or fisher to shop here.  Its really an outdoorsmans (or womans) paradise.  They sell a lot of everything, from camo to camping gear.  They have two floors, and most of everything is going to be on the first floor.  They sell mens and womans clothing, camping supplies, guns, knives, household items, archery stuff, boating supplies and tons more.  I find that they have a lot of great stuff for just about anyone.  I was really impressed with thier womans clothing selection, and the prices on some of thier items were a heck of a lot cheaper then Bass Pro Shop by far.  (bass pro shops clothes are wwwaaaayyy over priced!)  Im talking general clothing here, not specialty clothing such as camo, fishing or hunting gear.  The place here also has a really great little cafe upstairs, and staff are located everywhere, and seem to be friendly and helpful.  They even have a bargin room with discounted supplies and some clothing, but I found it to be a bit picked over, so I didnt purchase anything.  Cabelas also has an amazing display of live fish, and wildlife that is a sight to be seen.    Lots of game catches over the years that are on display, that you can observe and really enjoy!  This place is worth the trip, for any enthusiast really.

Okay, so this is one of the worst, if not THE worst mall in Metro Phoenix, possibly Arizona all together.  I remember coming here when I first moved out here and feeling like I walked into an alternate universe.  When I first came here many years ago, it was in worse shape then it is now.  They had an indoor skating rink, tons of teens running around and just a really bad place overall.  I stopped coming here for a long time because there was really no reason.  The people were shady and scary, the few stores that are here I can find anywhere, and it just wasn't a positive experience.  I know that every mall can't be 5 stars, but I never thought that it could be this bad....I mean, why not just shut the place down already?  Since I've last been back here, some things have changed. Yes, it's still dirty metro center, but the skateboard track is gone, the shady kids are gone, and it seems like they've cleaned it up a little...and I mean a little.  It's not as crappy as it was when I first got here, but this place has a lllllooooonnnnnngggggg  way to go to repair the bad reputation that it has earned.  The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is solely based off the fact that A) they have the Maricopa humane society in here with pet adoptions in an old pet store. You can adopt cats or dogs from here, along with donate things like pet food, towels or whatever.  THIS is awesome.  I go and visit the pets while I'm here, and the place is always well staffed, clean and friendly.  B)  They have a dillard's clearance center to go shopping at, so you can buy some clothes at closeout prices.    They have done some improvements since I first came here years ago, in regards to cleaning it up, but it still needs a lot of work. ton's of empty stores, etc.  Aside from that, its the slum mall that one would expect.  Lousy food court, questionable people and overall this place has gone to the dogs.  I wish they would either bulldoze it or do a 180 and make it into something decent instead of leaving it like it is...

This store is seriously a treasure!  One of the best consignment stores I have shopped at in my day!  I wish they all were like this!  When you enter the store, it is extremely well organized.  Clothing for the women in the front, with lots of racks to mull over.  Everything here is divided up my size, style, etc for easier shopping.  Pants, blazers, shirts, etc. Plus, they have a nice variety of casual clothing, work outfits and everything in between.  They sell name brand items in excellent condition...but at times, I do feel like some of the prices are a tad higher then maybe I am willing to pay.  I guess its really up to the shopper what is considered "expensive" but I usually feel like I am getting a deal, most of the time.  They also have a great shoe selection organized by size, purses, some mens clothing, formal wear. luggage, and a HUGE "home" section.  Dishes, comforters, all in excellent shape.  Nothing here is in bad shape...just "lightly used."  I would purchase (and have) any of thier housewares, as they are discriminating on what they sell and stock.  I do know that they offer markdowns for items that are past a certian date to clear thier shelves.  So, if its older then 30 days, you get a specific discounted amount off....60 days, bigger discount, etc.  I do not believe that they sell any furniture, which is a bummer.  No couches or entertainment centers, which is somewhat of a sore note for me.   I knocked them down a star for that, becuase I wish that they did, considering that they are literally a Scottsdale address, and I am sure with all of the designer clothing they have in here, that getting thier hands on some top notch furniture to sell would not be a difficult task.

I used to come here on a more regular basis when I moved out here 5 years ago and was living a lot closer to this place.  But, since I live 30+ miles away from it now, its a bit of a drive for me to get up here for coffee.  I've always loved this place...intimate, real, and an all around awesome place.  Its part coffee, part wine, part food and has an awesome ambiance.   I came here today because I wanted to get out of the house and do something different with my Saturday afternoon...so I trecked the 30 miles and enjoyed my afternoon in Cave Creek and had a mocha here.  I also picked up a pound of coffee while I was at it for my mom since her birthday was coming up.  Plenty of comfy seating, inside and out, along with internet as well.  This place is such a gem, nothing else like it.  You can come here morning noon or night and really enjoy what the offer....weather its coffee to start your day, dinner or some evening drinks.  Love this place!  I will say, the only downside to this place is the parking....Its limited, so if the place is busy, good luck figuring out where the heck to park!  Other then that, its fine....I hate sucky parking!

I finally made it here after promising myself forever that I would try this place.  I have to say, I liked it!  Upon entering, the place was pretty small and narrow.  It's almost like a long hallway.  To the left, theres bar seating, with some really high chairs-thats where I sat.  To the right, against the wall, theres some tables for two lined down the side.  In the back, there seems to be a set of larger tables for bigger parties.  The place is kind of drab and dark.  Not what I had expected.  Dark tile, dimly lit.  The kitchen area is immediately behind the bar, and you can watch the people work as they make your food.   The staff here seems to be a younger crowd, early 20's.  Kind of hippie-ish, but in a good way.  They all seem to work really well together.  I kind of got a student feel when I was in there.  When I sat at the bar, I was greeted immediately by a really nice guy, who offered me a menu and asked if I needed any help.  The menu is really large, with a nice variety of pasties to choose from.  I got the Philly steak pastie, and it was really good!  I think they make it fresh when you order, which I loved.  The servings here are large, and I was unable to finish my entire pastie, so please remember that when ordering.  Aside from a minimal wait, I had a decent experience.  I didn't care for the dark n drab decor, but overall, it was a good experience.

Dangit, I needed a blizzard tonight. After a long week of interviews and other stressful events, I wanted to treat myself to something sweet, so I came here for a blizzard.  Mind you, I've been here before, and I have to say, it's not my favorite location.  The other DQ's that I've been to in the past have been clean, well staffed and overall a nice experience.  This one? Eh, not so much.  For starters, its small. I can deal with that. Parking is tight and they only have a few spots.  Sadly, the place inside is not the greatest. The first time I came here last summer, the place was a mess! dirty floors and counters and the pop machine was leaking all over the place. You had to step in a puddle of water to get to the register.  Today, it was actually cleaner then normal. I imagine because they don't have the summer foot traffic, so it's probably a lot less busy.  Service was pleasant, but really really slow.  The guy behind the counter was nice and friendly, but he didn't seem to be getting a lot of help from his coworkers, so that slowed it down even more.  They do have outdoor seating here, but it's limited. They only have a few tables and chairs inside, so if you want, you can always sit outside at one of their tables, which is cool as long as the weather's nice.  Overall, I come here rarely, and it's only because its close to home.  There's definitely better run Dairy Queens out there in regards to cleanliness, speed of service and other things, but this one is not one of those places.  Will I return? Probably only out of sheer laziness to not go any further then I have to, and if I want a blizzard, I guess this is place.

This is a sports bar/resturant that actually serves some decent food.  I have eaten there with friends and by myself, and its not half bad.  I wouldn't take my parents or a first date there, but worth it if your in the area and want a beer with some burgers.  They have great happy hour specials with half off all appitizers.  Under new ownership as of last July, and I think thier trying to turn the place around.  Bonuses of going ot this place:       Casual laid back dining atmosphere, with staff that wait on you in a reasonable amount of time.        A place I feel comfortable eating alone or with friends        Great happy hour specials on drinks and appitizers.  Downside:    Outdated interior that needs updating.  Drab, dull and dark.

Wow, I love this place!  Westworld is amazing.  It's an outdoor horse arena, with about 10 show rings for horses.  They host mostly horse events, but there are occasional dog shows, the barrett jackson car auction, and a few other random shows as well.  They also have a polo field where the scottsdale polo team practices regularly.  You can watch them play and practice for free as well!  Most of the events are free, and parking is always available.  Rarely do I ever have to pay an entrance or  parking fee.  This is a great place for anyone to go to..families, kids, dates, etc.  Theres also stuff going on pretty much every single weekend, so you can almost always count on something happening there.  Its located off Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and the Loop 101.

I'm not much of a health food nut, but I do like coming here from time to time because I really enjoy their selection of products.  They have a large clean produce selection, soaps, house cleaners, a ton of vitamins, meat, chicken and fish area along with a bunch of other products.  They have a bulk section in the middle of the store that I like to cruise because you can get just about anything you want in this isle.  Stuff like candy, sugar, a wide variety of nuts and much much more.  Overall store is clean and well stocked at all times.  When I'm here I usually come for the same few items.  Their ground beef is just the best in town, and I'm not kidding when I say that.  My old boss told me about it one time, I tried it and now I'm hooked. It's a little bit more expensive then your regular grocery store, but it's organic and tastes awesome.  They also have really awesome friendly staff here as well.  The few times I've needed help or had questions, the staff has really gone out of their way for me.  Despite that the store has a more intimate feel, it's a great place to shop to pick up a variety of fresh items.  Great prices on produce and overall a fun experience.

This is by far the best shopping mall in the valley. I prefer coming here hands down for just about every reason imaginable.  It's upscale without the snobbery of Scottsdale Fashion square with an amazing selection of stores and food courts to choose from.  I used to come here all the time for stuff, and always walked away satisfied.  It's well maintained, clean and yet still offers something for everyone.  The only drawback to this place is that even though getting in and out is reasonable, you can get into a bit of a backup at times due to it being literally right off the 101.  If your coming from the East, making a left turn can be lengthy and annoying especially if it's during rush hour. Coming from any other location is okay because you can swing a right turn in no time.  There's also an amazing selection of restaurant's outside of the mall and they have a great food court as well.  Parking is awesome and it's easy in and easy out here.  Overall, probably the best mall in the valley.  Classy, yet not overdone and well maintained. I love you Chandler fashion center!

actually found this amazing coffee shop by accident one day.  It is tucked away in a shopping complex, next door to Hooters and behind the waffle house on Chandler Blvd and 48th Street.  They offer free wireless internet, great coffee, and the staff is wonderful.  Dimetri, the owner, plays for the Phoenix Symphony and often you will find him playing his violin, usually on the weekends when I am there.  He has some great coffee to drink, and the staff seems to be educated on what to serve.  They seem to have food there of some sort, but I don't eat when I am there.  If I do, I stick with the bagels and the veggie cream cheese.  I would also like to state that this location is now holding Chess games every tuesday.  They are doing more and more events during normal business hours and after hours as well.  Please check thier website and with the staff for further info.

Went here for dinner on Sunday, and had a blast.  I love a good burger, and I was really happy with my experience at this place.  It's a roadhouse type place, casual, jeans and tshirt type place.  They have a couple different seating areas, and I sat at the bar cuase it was just me.  But, they also have a dining room, and a patio as well.  I was really happy with the service when I was here.  My server was amazing. I told her it was my first time here, and she went through the menu with me, telling me what some of the popular dishes were. I ended up getting the BBQ burger with no bacon. Instead of just slapping fries with it like all places do, I actually got to choose a side.  I went with cheesy potatos!  I will be returning here again, as its a nice, relaxed atmosphere without comprimising service or decor.

After getting rained out at the Arabian Horse show at Westworld, I was very very hungry.   I was going to eat at the horse show, but since it was so muddy and wet, I didn't stay as long as I had anticipated.  After leaving the show, I drove down scottsdale road debating what I should eat.  Something filling, not fast food, that wasn't going to drain my pocketbook.  I then spotted Jasons Deli and immediately pulled in! I've been to their locations before.  I used to frequent the location in Awatukee, but have yet to have been to this one before.  The menus for them are all the same (obviously) at all their locations.  You order at the counter, pay, and then they bring the food out to you.  I got the half sandwich with a salad.  Gigantic sanwiches, and salad was self serve from the salad bar.  I had wanted a Cesar Salad, and the guy told me I could make it myself at the bar, but when I went to the salad bar, there wasn't any Cesar Salad stuff!  BUMMER!  Thats okay, I survived with minimal crying involved.  Food here is good, ordering is a bit awkward for me though.  Prices are steep, but considering how much food you get, I guess the value is there.  I love a good deli sandwich, and this place seemed to hit the spot.  Not a true authentic deli, but good enough when you need some hearty food.  I would return again in a heartbeat.

Look, I love Dunkin donuts and their coffee.  They make great donuts, muffins and they are right around the corner from where I live.  I've come to this location a few times over the past few months for a variety of reasons, but mostly for their coffee!  They are open early, and have lots of pastries to choose from. This morning I came in because i needed to get some munckins for my friends and some donuts as well since we're all job hunting for work right now.  The girl behind the counter was nice and friendly, and helped me pick out the flavors of stuff that I needed.  There's also a guy who works there that has helped me in the past, not only in the store, but in the drive through as well.    The only down side, is that even though I was here at about 11 AM on a Monday morning, their stock seemed really hit! They were running low on everything (donuts, muffins and other pastries) and it was kind of disheartening.  Were they going to cook more?  I don't know!  I would assume so, but I can't say for sure.  This is also not the first time I have noticed this as well.  Overall, I would say I like it here. They also have free wifi, are open early, and have a great drive through.  Go check it out, you'll thank me that you did!

I haven't been to this location in some time, but wanted to swing by since I was in the market for some clothes, and felt like it was time do some shopping.  The place is in a strip mall, and seems to have a nice variety of clothing, from jeans, to work clothes, they seem to have a little bit of everything.  Prices are fair, but sometimes I came across a tag that was a bit pricey, but mostly the stuff here is affordable.  I picked up 2 cute tops, both were Liz Claiborne, and were only $7.95 each.  I was disappointed because I was also looking for a nice pair of khaki's, but didn't have any luck.  They had tons of black slacks, and capri's, but no khakis!  Somewhat dissapointed, but I still had a good time.  I will be back in the future, as they seem to have a nice selection of name brand items and most of it is reasonably priced.  They also carry shoes, purses, some jewelry and I even saw a few prom like dresses too! (puffy shiny satin dresses that no one over the age of 16 would be caught wearing!  LOL)

Dear Waffle House,   I love you dearly.  You are like a comfy pair of shoes, or a really good boyfriend.  Your always available 24 hours a day, your always within a few miles of me, and your food is reliable comforting goodness.  I came home from work on Friday tired and very stressed out.  When I woke  up Saturday Morning, the mood was somewhat still present. I decided that I needed to treat myself to a warm hearty breakfast, and I knew I was overdue for a visit to a Waffle house.  This location is just like all the others, in regards to size and design.  It seems to be a more dated, possibly older version of some of the other waffle houses I have been in.  But, the food here is always good, reliable and tasty.  I had eggs, hash browns and raisin toast with coffee.  I cleaned my plate and left one happy camper!

I had dinner last night for the first time at this place, and I have to say that I really really liked it a lot!  Upon entering the location, I was impressed with how it was set up.  Clean, nice, with lots of outdoor seating.    The decor gave me a "fancy" feeling of dining, yet without the menu sticker shock.  Clean nice marble looking tables, some booths, and  a big beautiful mirror hung from one of the walls.  Well decorated!  After sitting down to eat with Gabi, We were waited on almost immediately, and the server was attentive, and gave us time to think about our orders.  The menu has a wide variety of items to choose from, and from what I could tell, ALL the prices were relatively cheap!  I ended up eating the Gyro pita, and I must say, it was tasty, and the portion was quite ample and large.    I would put this on my list of places to return for the good eats since I was so happy the first time around.  I feel that you can't go wrong at this place, from my experience.  I would feel comfortable bringing my parents and dates here as I was impressed with the overall feel of the resturant, along with the excellent food, good sized portions, wide menu variety, and cheap prices.

I am currently dog sitting for a girlfriend of mine here in awatukee.  I've known about this park for a while, and took the dog to check it out for the first time.  I really wavered between 3 and 4 stars on this.  I'm giving the park the benefit of the doubt, since it is a park, and I wish all neighborhoods could have a dog park available to them.  Where I grew up, we had parks for kids, but there was no designated dog park area.  Having an accessable dog park in the area is such a luxury to me, and I think its amazing and wonderful.  Anyways, the park is simple.  Fenced grassy area, stinky water area, one bench area for shade and thats it.  Heres where my disappointment sets in.  I have been to other dog parks in the city of Phoenix, and seen a lot bigger and better jobs having been done.  I think they should have had a better water area for starters.  It was a spicket with a pool of water around it.  Dogs were drinking and wading in it like a bunch of wild animals.  It looked like a scene out of National Geographic.  At other city dog parks, Ive seen actual spickets that you turn on that do not fester water pools.  I also think they could have provided a better shade area, with more coverage.  All I can say is that the dog had an amazing time regardless, and that was the point of all this.  Dog was tired for the rest of the day and now thinks Im the queen since I took his furry butt to the park!

OMG LADIES! I am HUGE on the bus.  I've been riding it to work for 2.5 years, and am horrified that you guys aren't pushing the benefits of commuting and mass transit in this city!  I love Valley Metro. I ride the Rapid bus, every day, twice a day.  The rapid shuttle is part of Valley Metro, but it is a  very different bus line then the city buses that I think some of you have been riding on. There are 4 Rapid Routes...1 from the west valley, (I-10 west from Avondale) 1 from the north (I-17 from Bell Road) 1 from the East, (I-10 East from Chandler) and 1 servicing the 51, from the 51 and Shea.    If it were not for these rapid shuttles, I probably would not have a job, and probably have lost my mind by now. After I moved here, within 3 months, I had busted a windshield, had someone do a hit and run on me on the expressway, and basically sat in traffic for a ridiculous amt of time, so much that I was commuting an obnoxious amount of time.  Finally, a fellow co-worker told me that she commutes in half the time from the same place using the bus. Since I started riding the rapid, I've been hooked.  My busses are on time, my commute is 1/3 of what I was doing when I was driving, and the amt of money I have saved on gas is unbelieveable.

After much anticipation, the light rail finally opened for business in December of 2008.  I eagerly waiting on pins and  needles for this.  See, after I moved out here, I got hooked on the Rapid shuttle bus system.  It was glorious!  I was able to get to work in less time (and gas money) then if I were to have driven.  The same rule applies to the light rail.  Its a much easier commute for me versus driving.   But, sometimes  I wonder what other people really expect the light rail to do for them.  I wanted to list the pros and cons of the light rail so people can adaquately adjust thier expectations and understand what they are getting into.  Pros:  A) The cost of the light rail is relatively cheap.  $2.50 a day, or $45 a month, you are getting a rock solid deal.  Think about how much gas you use in your car.  I doubt its less then what light rail charges.  B) The light rail is clean!  I have yet to see a dirty train!  Well air conditioned as well.  C)  The train is not going to be faster then your car speedwise.  I've seen a few reviews where people have said that they could have driven faster then the train.  Well, duh!  Your car is going to be faster then the train.  It makes frequent stops, and doesnt go as fast as your car does.  Please plan accordingly.  You will need to leave earlier due to waiting for the train, riding and walking to your destination.  D) If you see something wacko on the train, call 911.  Or valley metro.   seriously.  Cons:   I can't think of any at the moment.  Anyways, point is, I ride it to work twice a day M-F.  It saves me gas money, and mostly a very expensive parking bill for working downtown.  Please, ride the light rail, and enjoy!

I came here on a date Saturday afternoon and have to say, this place is great!  Holy cow!  Total gem!  This place is suprisingly located in a strip mall of all things.  I walked in and really liked how the place was decorated.  Its not a huge resturant, but has a more fancy feel to it.  Not a place I would walk into with jeans on.  Classy enough to put on a nice outfit for a great experience.  (Im normally not a fancy diner, but for dates, I tend to turn it up a notch.)  I was impressed with the service that I had here.  Menu is loaded with just about any and every dish you could imagine. I like variety, and this place had it.  Our meal started off with a bread basket and some dipping oil which I liked a lot.  Server got our drinks and we took our time reviewin the menu.  I went with the Lasanga.  I think my date had the chicken parm.  Servings were nice and big!  Tasty too!  It was funny, because even though the service was great, the service was kinda funny.  Date took notice and we had a good laugh about it.  I was taking my time with my lasgana, and the server kept asking me all the time if I was done. I kept telling him "no, I'm just a slow eater." Then, he would come back like 5 minutes later and ask the same thing again.  rinse, wash, repeat for the last half hour of the date.  Plus, the mexican bus boy literally stood table side to refill my beverage after I took more then 2 sips.  It was actually hysterical!  Date and I had a great chuckle over this!  Anyways, I really enjoyed my experience at Nicks.  I guess they have several valley locations, and I plan on returning.   Great place for dates, parents, or just something nice!

I found this place after getting something in the mail and thought I would check it out.  I was so glad that I did.  It's easy to find, on the Southeast corner of Kyrene and Elliot in a shopping complex.    This place is great. It's kind of what I would call a "fajita bar."  Basically, they have a menu, but you pick and choose basically how you want to build your food.  They have Tacos, burritos, fajitas, all made to your liking.  (think Subway here folks, but substantially better.)  I ended up getting the steak burrito, (I think it was on the menu as a "joey bag of donuts) and it was yummy! Very tasty. IM STUFFED.  You choose what kind of rice you want, toppings, steak, chicken, etc.  They have a nice variety of food to choose from.  you can get a combo thing with chips and a drink, or just a burrito/taco/fajita alone.  Either way, your going to walk out of here with a TON of food.  I liked this place because its fresh and hot, and theres variety.  I guess being that I grew up outside of AZ, I wasn't raised on southwestern food, so Im learning to grow a taste for it.  I feel like this is the place I can enjoy good casual dining, for a good price, and enjoy the flavor of the southwest on my stomachs terms.  The only thing I did not like was that I felt like the service could have been better.  I had lots of questions about the menu, and how things work here, since it was my first time to this place.  I kind of felt like the guy behind the counter didn't want to take the time to answer my questions that I had, and when I asked him questions, basically he pointed to the menu and that was hius way of answering me.    Some kind of positive interaction would have made this a 5 star event.

I was on the light rail today and spotted this coffee shop from the train, so I figured on my way back I would check it out. The place was really cute, with a great selection off coffee and drinks to choose from.  The place has tons of seating, including a bunch of comfy looking couches and chairs, along with tables and chairs if you wish to use them.  Several people were there surfing the internet, and I wandered in looking for some coffee.  Initially, I wanted a Mocha.  When I was asking the girl behind the counter about it, she said her expresso machine was broken, but she could substitute coffee for it instead.  I decided that I would rather just get the coffee instead so that's what I got.  She was really nice about it, and apologized for it being out of order.  While waiting for my coffee, the girl offered me a pastry in compensation for her machine being down. Whatever she gave me, it was awesome! It was chocolate chip something, and tasted divine!   I was going to sit in the patio area and relax by the fountain, but I passed because the seats outside were already taken. I ended up hanging out on the couch inside, which was really comfy.    The coffee itself was strong but tasty, and everything went well. I would gladly stop by again when I'm in the area or have time when doing stuff.  Go check it out, the place is pretty cool!

This poor Fry's is seriously outdated and depressing to shop at.  I loath going here, because it seriously depresses me to shop here.  When I first moved here, I was used to seeing all of these really updated and nicely decorated Fry's and Safeways.  Clean, modern, inviting.  Lots of selection to choose from.  Eventually, I've come to shop at Fry's for the past few years, becuase it was closest to my house.  I really fell in love with the Frys by my old place at Ray and Rural.  That was my all time favorite location.  But, this store just plain sucks.  It doesn't have what all the other Frys have..full meat and Deli, and all the fixings that have made me come to love Frys over the past few years.  This place really needs a makeover!  The reason I DO go here is because A) they have a Bank of America in the entrance when I need to quickly get cash, and B) They have an SRP machine where I can pay my SRP bill.  These are the main 2 reasons I come here.  Shopping here is sporatic for me at best.

I have been shopping at this Safeway for a few months now, and its not so bad.  Since I have started shopping there since last summer, things have improved!  They did a remodel at the end of the year and it looks a lot better then it did before.  This store is an older Safeway...not the coolest or newest one I have been in, but nice enough that I like it and feel comfortable shopping here.  They have most everything you would need for one stop shopping..the usual Safeway Deli, meat counter, pharmacy and a nice selection of food and other stuff.  I gave it 4 stars becuase A) they recently remodeled and B) they have a clean store!

I come here a lot for grocery shopping, and it's my main stop for all things grocery.  For starters, Fry's has a great selection of food and they have really competitive prices.  Loads of produce, meat, chicken, a great deli counter and plenty of other household items to grab while your here.  The lines are never to horribly long, as in comparison to other grocery stores I've been too.  I never have to wait more then a few minutes, and overall the staff is nice.  They have a Bank of America in here located at the front of the store, and sometimes the lines can get long there.  They have a great customer service counter, and the lines get pretty long for that too.  On the other side of the coin, there have been a few times where I've had to ask staff members for help finding something. Normally it's not a problem, but I've had more then one occasion where I get the "huh? what's that? I dunno what (insert random item is) and I have to talk to 3 different people to figure out where the heck the random item is.  It's not often, but it has happened more then once. Even though some of the staff members here are on top of things, other staff members seem to not really care, or they have no clue what I'm talking about or are just so totally useless that I wonder how they get dressed in the morning.  Thus, minus one star!  There is a weird crowd here from time to time, and I think it's the creepers who somehow make it up here from the light rail.  Had a few circumstances where I've been asked for $$ inside and outside of the store.  Crazy!  I wish I would have complained about it, but usually I'm in more of a hurry and just don't have the energy to say anything to the staff.  I think that's why they have a security guard here at night time to keep the riff raff to a minimum.  Nothing like being asked for a dollar or some other crazy crap!  Overall, I like it here. Yes, it's not perfect, but the few flaws here are overshadowed by good stuff like quick service, great prices and a nice big selection of items.

Barro's Pizza is awesome. I came here for dinner Saturday night and loved it.  Please was quiet, but pizza was good none the less.  The girl who took my order was friendly, even for late on a Saturday night.  Barro's pizza is the bomb, and I will be back, thats for sure.

I LOVE COSTCO!!!!!!!!!!  I could freakin LIVE HERE.  I get so excited to go here, its not even funny.  OMG.  Ok, so my mom's in town and shes a costco member.  She KNOWS I live for this place.  Of course, its set up like all the other ones, but shopping here can't be beat.  Granted, we went on Christmas Eve, and it was SO busy!  But, its always busy at costco, so its not a surprise.  They carry everything I need, and I love it here.  Lots of stuff to buy, including booze, food, gas, and the obvious other items that are sold here.  Totally worth the membership, as long as you don't mind being around lots of people.

I cant remember how I found these guys, but anything beats leaving the car at the airport in the summer time AND having to pay for it.  I have used these guys several times, and have had a mixed bag of experiences.  Nothing terrible, but nothing outstanding either. I will list the pros and cons of these guys so you can decide for yourself.  Ok, the good first: A) if you make reservations online, and you have a US Airways frequent flier number, you get 50 miles put in your flyer account.  This is only valid online, and not over the phone!  So, get your miles on and book a reservation on thier website.  B) Shuttles so far for pickup at my place have been ontime.  They show up in their 15 minute window as promised.  C) vans are clean, drivers are friendly and helpful.    D) they load your bags in and out of the van for you, and take you right to the terminal at curbside.  E) I think thier prices are fair and reasonable, and I love that.  F)  If your coming into sky harbor, you dont need a reservation to take a blue van.  You can go to the curbside and just wait for a van to get you.  Awesome if your flight gets into late (like a 3am arrival) and you cant get someone to pick you up.    G) if your a nurotic traveler like me and like to be at the airport super early, and you book online, you can  alter the flight times if you want to get there a little early. I did this recently when flying back to Detroit at Thanksgiving tme and wanted the extra hour to make sure I didnt miss  my flight,.  Ok, now the cons  A) I had a crazy lady driver last summer who almost got me killed! OMG she was HORRIBLE.  Hard gas, Stomp on brake.  Repeat the entire 17 miles to the airport. yea, I was dying to get out of her van since she was driving so bad.  B) The vans for taking you away from the airport to your home are decided by location.  So, if you live in Chandler, your not going to get in the scottsdale van.  The reps there will know what van your going in.  Ive had to wait a few minutes as other travelers got into their designated vans before me.  Im fine with this for a few reasons. For starters, if it gets me home quicker to NOT have to go through surprise to get back to my place in Chandler, then I will wait.  Be patient people, 5 extra minutes on the curb will spare you a long ride home.  I reccomend these people, but please always be careful when using ANY transportation company.

OMG!!!  I can't BELEIVE NO one has told me about this place!  Holy cow!  I LOVE it here!  Here's how I discovered Barros.  Last night I was starving and exhausted.  I refused to cook and after looking in my fridge, decided some action needed to be taken.  So, I venture out to find a new place to eat at.  I wanted something quick, and tasty.  So, I'm driving around and see Barro's from the road.  I have heard of this place before from Yelpers, but never bothered to check the place out.  So, I figured tonight was the night.  I park the car and go inside.  I really liked what I saw upon entering.  Tables, booths, lots of folks eating and ordering, but nothing so out of control that it would be troublesome.  I saw thier menu and was pleased with the choices that they have.  They seem to have a really nice variety of stuff to choose from, and a lot of options for ala carte pizzas and pizzas that they sell as a menu selection.  They have meat lovers, chicken BBQ, and most common choices you would think of when pizza comes to mind.  I decided to go simple this time since it was me dining alone and my first time eating here.  I went with a small Pepperoni pizza, and dined in.  Even though they were busy, my wait in line was minimal (less then 5 minutes) and my wait for pizza was about 20.  Not bad for a late Friday night.  When the pizza came, it was like winning the lottery in my mouth, and to my eyes.  Finally, a GOOD freakin pizza in Phoenix.  FINALLY!  UGH, I've been waiting for this moment for 3 years.  I can finally eat good pizza again!  What also excited me was that they serve beer and wine here! I wanted a glass of wine SO bad, but passed because the menu said they only had Merlot, Chardonnay, and one other wine.  I would have ordered a glass if I was not dining by myself, but this was so cool.  Awesome for serving alcohol to make my day even better!  It was the thick crust pizza, and that excited me.  everything was so delicous!  I was in love, and still am with Barros.  I took my leftovers home, and plan on returning to enjoy thier delicous food once more and many times again.

I love the fact that this Dominos is in my backyard.  When Im in a pinch, to tired, or just flat out lazy, I order carry out from this location.  Dominos makes all kinds of pizzas, and now subs too!  They make thier pizza quick, and you can order online, phone, or walkin.  I walked in last night and placed my order.  The place was clean, staff was friendly and professional.  Those three things keep me coming back for more!  I plan on returning to this location for more pizza in the future.

I finally got a chance to stop into bookman's and check the place out.  The place is really big, with a huge selection of books, tapes, records, and all kinds of good reading.  I was pleased with what I saw.  The place is organized like a traditional bookstore, by fiction, travel, etc with signs above for easy location.  I also think they have authors listed in alpha order, giving some kind of sembalence to find what your looking for.  On the downside, I felt that I couldn't find a place to sit and read.  I do like to sit and grab a book off the shelf and read a bit if i have time.  I felt that I could not do that here.   I only noticed one couch located in the front of the store.  It was literally in front of the registers.  Not very relaxing to try to sit and read when you have a milion people walking in front of you.  Plus, if someone sits down on the couch, forget it!  I like some seating throughout the store for random reading sessions.

dew bow bow.ooooooo yyyyeeeaaaa.....dew bow bow.  This is the song that I should be singing, as I slowly enter the Port of Subs after deboarding the light rail.  Port of Subs is my drug of choice, and eating such tasty subs makes me happy.  I got 12 inches last night...12 inches of subs....and it tasted so good!  nomnomnomnom!  Port of Subs never fails me.  Its just so good!  All bread cooked on site, and not like the chain sub places, its actually really really good!  I got the #18, lots of meat and whatever I wanted.  Tasty!  Thank you Port of Subs, thank you.  Eating here makes my brain and stomach delightfully happy!

I've recently started shopping at this Fry's as its right across the street from where I work.  I mostly come here during the week either before my day starts, or on my lunch hour to grab something to eat.  This is definately one of the nicer, larger Frys in the valley.  Its huge!  They have everything in here that you could possibly need.  Deli, bakery, large produce area, booze, meat, and everything else.  I personally hang out at the deli a lot, as I love thier paninis and other sandwiches that they make here onsite.  I also like this Frys since they have a Bank of America in here, along with a starbucks, which saves me time and trips to get coffee or a stop at the ATM on the way into work.  Today I came here to pick up a few things since I was in the area, and had a few extra moments to stop in and shop.  This place was packed!    I will be back in the future, and will continue to cruise through here on my lunch hour, as the lines go quick and the selection is large!

I love this Frys..when I lived closer, it was one of the two that I shopped at.  This place has it all...electronics, food, pharmacy, and a Bank of America!  This particular store is georgous!  Very clean, well lit, I love the layout and its a pleasure to shop in.  I like it here because its not overdone...the meat and produce section does well for me, becuase its clean and inspires me to cook better food and cook stuff more often.  I love it!

I shop here often and frequently, for a variety of different reasons.  For starters, its really close to my home.  Secondly, they have a bank of America branch located inside of the store, and thirdly, I like it here.  They have a great selection of products, and the prices to choose from.  They have a full service meat department, deli, hot foods counter, produce, along with all the traditional grocery items you would need. They do the VIP card thing, and I use mine and have gotten several good deals by using it.  The customer service here is great, and the staff is alway friendly and helpful when I may need it.  There are a few things that I disliked, thus the 4 star review.  For starters, I wish they had more of the deli selections that I like.  I find that some of the stuff that they offer I do not eat, or am just not interested in eating.  They also don't seem to "mix it up" with offering more variety to the case as well.   That would make a huge difference to me.  The other thing that I disliked was I think they carry to much "other stuff." I don't get that.  They have a toy section, patio furniture, and other stuff that I think could be used for more shelf space for food.  I want food when I go to the grocery store...not a new patio set.  Otherwise then that, the place has great hours, friendly staff, and most everything you would need for eating at home.

I LOVE this Starbucks.  Why?  Because they are awesome!  The people that work at this particular location are warm, friendly, know me by name and seem to help me with whatever questions I have.  I've been hanging out at this location since I've been working at my job for about 3 years now.  Its located here within the Arizona Center, and its usually where you find me eating lunch almost every day.  I love to sit on thier patio area, or even inside depending on the weather or what I need to do.  The place is usually clean, and there is great indoor and outdoor seating.  There's a few people that have been working the counter that actually know me by name, and they are all so much fun!  If your down here, go and spend some time here to hang out.  Staff will help you with whatever you need.

I love Keirland commons!  It's a beautiful outdoor high end mall in North Scottsdale.  For starters, they have a really HUGE barnes and noble there worth checking out.  Secondly, they have a variety of dining options, from Starbucks, to PF changs, to a few pretty expensive places as well.  Guarenteed to please anyone looking for a variety of dining options with hard to please pallets.  They also have a great little breakfast joint tucked away in the middle of the place, that has a pretty decent atmosphere.  I cant remember the name of it, but its the only bagel breakfast joint in the spot.  There is also plenty of shopping to do here, with a great variety of stores.  They have a fabulous cookware store there as well, that offers some cooking classes.  I believe there is also a great wine bar there as well, amoungst other things.  Definately a must do for anyone!  Its also located near the very expensive and fancy Westin resort.  That hotel is worth checking out as well.  This place is DEFINATELY a place to bring your parents, date or just walk around alone.  Worth the trip, even if you live outside of scottsdale.

OMG This Fry's is a DREAM come TRUE!  This is how I want grocery shopping to be!  Holy goodness, I could live here...  Ok, so this is one of the flagship Fry's stores, and has everything.  When you pull in, theres free valet (im sure you have to tip though) and covered parking.    Customer service here is awesome! I had a girl unload my cart for me at the check out! Who does that?  Loved it!!    They have a sushi bar here, FULL deli with lots of premade dishes and plenty of meats, cheeses and breads.  They have a full wine cellar and hold wine tastings as well.  I checked out the wines, and they have everything!  They have your typical $20 bottle, all the way up to a $400 of red wine.  Nice!  I was also thrilled to see the nice selection of Kosher items here as well.  They even have a cooking school.  Totally worth going here.  Make the time to do the drive because this is how grocery shopping should be!!

This movie theatre has amazing prices!  My mom and I went here on Christmas Day to watch a movie, and loved the low ticket prices. Definately cheaper then Harkins and AMC.  They show new releases, and have all the same stuff as a regular theatre..popcorn, candy, etc.  They just don't charge an arm and a leg to see it, which I love!  Plus, it looks like its the only one in the state??  Nice.  Totally plan on going here again.  Seating is wonderful, prices can't be beat, and its surrounded by a few resturants and shops so you could catch dinner and do it all in one trip!

What?  A thrift store?  *squeals tires and Tokyo drifts into parking lot* I'M THERE! NO FURTHER EXPLINATION NEEDED!    For those of you who know me, I love checking out thrift shops and second hand stores. You never know what your going to find, and each one had something different then the other.  When I pulled in here today, it was surprisingly busy. Parking lot was mostly full, and considering it's a Thursday afternoon, I guess that's a good sign. I didn't know what to expect when I came in, so I was glad to see a decent selection of stuff when I entered.  At first, it seemed sort of typical.  Men's and women's clothing organized by size, purses, shoes and other stuff in the back like books and knick knacks. I found a few tops that I liked, and a set of Party lite candles.  At first I wasn't paying much attention to the prices on the clothing, but after I was digging for a bit and found a few name brand items. I was like "oh, this is kinda cool to find a Liz Claiborne top."  But I noticed that it was really expensive.  Like $15.  yet, the surrounding clothing was substantially cheaper. Why? Because it wasn't name brand.  They seriously mark up the really nice stuff, like the top that I found, and charge less for the no name items or the ones in worse shape.  For a thrift shop, I was surprised at the huge range of prices here. Some of them were reasonable, and I understand that they have to make a buck, but its not a consignment store...its a donation based place.  If Goodwill will sell me the same Liz Claiborne top for well under $10, YOU CAN TOO. Don't charge me triple the price. I've done a lot of thrift shopping in my day, and trust me, that's way to much considering its shoved in the middle of the rack and your making a 100% profit off it. If this were a consignment shop, I would understand, but its not!  Secondly, this place had no changing rooms. How the heck am I supposed to try stuff on to see if it fits properly?  FAIL!  Also, they had only one register open, and I got stuck behind a lady who was buying literally half the dam store. I can get past the line thing, but no changing rooms in site? I ended up putting the clothes back because I couldn't try them on.  I did score some party lite candles here though, so that made the trip worth it.  I would go back, but I wouldn't say it's on my short list. If you are driving by, stop in and give it a whirl.

So, I found this bagel place because its in the same shopping strip as my 'new' Fry's grocery store.  I went in, and it was pretty good.  They have a nice variety of fresh bagels, sandwiches, and a nice menu selection of items to choose from.  I went with a bagel, and asked if they had lox cream cheese.  He said that he would make it fresh for me on request!  wooohoo!  I really like this place better then Einstiens, and the guys there seem to be friendly and cool.   Great place to grab a bagel and a coffee on a Saturday or Sunday Morning!  PS.  This is my 100th review!  go me!

How can a Target be ghetto?  It's impossible!  I'm at this specific Target often and frequently, and it's perfectly nice and clean.  Place is well stocked, and just like every other Target I've set foot into in my day.  I come here because it's close to my home, and, well, frankly, its hard to hate a Target.  The staff here is always friendly and helpful, and offer all the same services that the other Targets do anywhere else in America.  I come here for a zillion different reasons, but mostly because Target is awesome, its closer to me then Walmart, and they carry everything I need.    Will return as often and as frequently as possible, since I love it here!

I hit this car wash for the first time today, and was quite impressed. It's on the NE Corner of Chandler, Kyrene is the crossroad.   It's very organized, clean, and seems to run really efficently.    Everything is automated here.  When you pull in, theres two lanes, which are to pay at.  They have a computerized screen that gives you menus to choose from for what kind of car wash and extra services your looking to get.  I went for the $5 basic car wash, which is there basic one.    After you do the touch screen menu, you insert your money, and the gate arm lifts, and allows you to drive up to the wash.  You have to stay in your car, but thats okay.  A guy directed me into the wash, and hosed off my car.  He did NOT push in my mirrors, which I didnt like, becuase I had to get out after the wash to push them back into place.  Points lost for that.  They do have free vaccuums here though, which is a bonus!  They are shaded, so that way you dont end up roasting if your getting stuck vacuuming in the sun. They also have a variety of extra services to choose from when you get your car washed, like rainx treatments!!    The only downside, is that if the vacuum bays are full, your out of luck.  Plus, if your like me, and had to pull off to the side to adjust your mirrors, there really isnt much room, so thats not to cool.  Please, also check out there website.  It's nice!  They have a bunch of valley locations, not just Chandler!  Bonus points for nice website.

I found this store completely by accident as well. I think I was on my way to IHOP or something, and BOOM there it was!  The store has quite a selection of goods.  Mostly womens clothing, shoes, household items as well.  The front of the store is for the household goods, and the back half is for clothing.  I believe the racks are organized according to size, which means you don't have to rifle through to try to find your size! I think this place is great! Awesome selection with a wide range of sizes, prices seem fair, and its in a great location.

I had such high hopes for this place.  I see them sporatically all over the valley, and assumed they were a half decent place to get wings and a beer.  I still think that, but my stomach does not.  I was dissapointed with my experience here, and for now, am scratching any plans on returning.  I wanted to try something different for dinner last night, something new.  I didnt want fancy, or to blow a lot of money, just something out of the norm.  I swung by wingstop after feeling like I needed some chicken wings, and not from Wendys.  lol.  So, I ended up here.  I walked in and the place isnt huge, but seats quite a few.  Studied the menu, asked a few questions, and ended up ordering the 3 peice chicken wing combo for a reasonable price.  I went with the BBQ flavor.  So, the food comes out like 10 minutes later.  I couldnt even finish it.  The fries were so salty and tasted weird..they were spicy I think?  My toungue didnt know what to do!  The wings were doused in BBQ sauce!  I mean buried!   It was like they went to Wendys or McDonalds, got some BBQ sauce, and poured it over the top of the wings, and wala,BBQ chicken wings.  It was just to much for me to finish.  It was to much with the sauce.  Even after I scraped some off, I still couldnt down the rest.    My stomach gurgled the rest of the night.  It didnt like what I fed it.  I woke up in the middle of the night wanting to hurl, but ended up not doing so, thank goodness.  It was to much for my tummy to handle.  :-(  I don't think I will be back any time soon.

This resturant is located off the Carefree Highway and the I-17.  Its up in the Carefree Highway, and is in a shopping complex with other businesses.    My friend Austin and I decided to dine here after doing a drive down the carefree highway.  Its a restaurant, with a bar feel to it as well.  When you walk in, the bar is the center point of the resturant, and the seating boarders the resturant.  When we were there, it was seat yourself, and we chose to sit in a booth.  They have a nice menu of appitizers, including nachos, spinach dip, and a few other things as well.  We were greeted by our hostess, who was warm and friendly.  She seemed to have a good grasp on the menu, as we had a few questions about what dish to get.  We ended up splitting an appatizer, which was a plate of sliders.  They have two different types of sliders, one with sauerkraut, and one that is a french dip style.  Since Austin and I couldnt decide which one we wanted, we asked if we could do half and half.    The server said thats A Okay, and they did it at no additional charge.  The server was really good about offering us all kinds of items.  Things like booze, more food, desert, and even after we finished, she asked if I wanted a coffee with baileys!  I passed since I was driving.  I recomend this place if you are ever up in this area.  Great full menu, and its easy to have a conversation here, as the noise level has never been a problem. Worth the stop!

I come to this QT location in the mornings before work to get whatever it is I may need before work.  This location, like other QT's, seems to be quite busy!  lots and lots of traffic in and out of here at any given time of the day.  The service here is really quick, so your in and out in no time.  Staff is friendly and efficient, and location is almost always in good clean condition.  Competitive prices on gas, they have decent coffee and muffins that are quite tasty and much cheaper then most other places around.  They also have a lot of gas pumps and parking spaces, so you'll never really have to wait to get gas or get in and out of this location.  The only downside is that people here don't drive well in the parking lot.  You really have to pay extra special attention, as I've almost gotten hit a few times while stopping here in the mornings.  Other then that, its one of the better gas stations in the valley when it comes to fast and friendly service, along with competitive prices for most stuff.

This circle K is a stand alone store with no gas station. It's on the southeast corner of 19th ave and Northern. I've stopped in here a few times over the past few months for stuff, and I kinda like it.  This location doesn't have any gas here, it's just a convenience store only.  The staff here is pretty friendly, and they run a pretty clean store. I usually get in and out real quick, so there isn't to much of a line here. Occasionally there is some riff raff out front, but not often.  They have coolers full of drinks, some snacks and usual convenience store items such as lottery tickets and smokes. Prices are fair and staff is friendly.  Overall, not half bad.  getting in and out can be tricky now adays with the light rail construction, so don't try making a left hand turn unless you want to crash your car into a bunch of construction cones.  lol

So, I was moving back to Michigan and needed a professional moving company to get my stuff across the country.  I got a total of four quotes, and decided on these guys.  I had Jacob come out to my apartment to look at my stuff and do a walk through with what I was going to take and how much it would cost.  Jacob was awesome! Aside from giving me a reasonable quote, he was totally professional and had a really warm friendly demeanor.  The whole thing took about an hour, and he gave me a few options of how I wanted it shipped. I decided on the crate containers, which came with $10,000 insurance on each one that I used. I only needed two, and that worked out perfectly! He was right on.  He emailed me a quote and after I was ready, I scheduled my move with him.  The guys got to my apartment about a half an hour after they told me they would, and they were so awesome! They had all the tools they needed, like ramps, professional wraps for my furniture and took great care when loading my stuff into the truck.  It was about three hours to load, do paperwork, and have them clean up their supplies when they were done.  Overall a very positive stress free experience.  The office also called while we were loading to make sure everything was going as planned and to see if things were okay.  I was also able to schedule my delivery when it got into town, and again, they were there within half an hour of their expected scheduled time.  Three guys showed up and unloaded my stuff in no time.  Half of it wen inside and the other half is in my moms garage.  Guys were efficient, friendly overall really professional and quick.  I would recommend these guys in a heartbeat if you want a reliable moving company that is trustworthy and professional.  Prices are competitive, and it was an overall great experience. I would use them again in the future.

I'm the first person to admit how much I love second hand shopping.  Phoenix has a great selection of thrift, second hand and consignment shops that would give anyone a good run for their money.  Goodwill has a lot of stores in the valley, so you don't have to drive far to find one.  But this store? IT SUCKS.  PERIOD. I remember coming here ages ago, and walking out wondering what the hell just happened.  As a rule, I donate stuff to the goodwill because I know it will go to people who need it and can purchase it at a fair and reasonable price.  But this store is just so depressing to shop in!  They have plenty of clothing, shoes, bags and stuff to choose from, but this location is just a disaster.  I came here today because I was on my way home from another thrift store and thought "o yea, the Goodwill. I'm going to see what they have today."  I only come here to donate now, but my suggestion is find another goodwill to shop at. There's plenty in the valley to choose from, and its worth the few extra miles to actually shop at a place that's a decent selection and doesn't stink of cinnamon.

Wow, what a wine bar!  I loved it here!   I was impressed from the moment I walked in.  Here's why:  For starters, they have indoor and outdoor seating. I felt relaxed and welcome from the moment I walked into this place.  Great setup, with ample seating throughout the location.  In the center of the bar, there are huge wine barrels set up with glass on top for seating.  In the center of the barrel are a bunch of corks, and you could easily seat 4 at each table.  They also have a bar as well, a couch at the front of the store, and a few tables off to the side.  Plenty of patio seating as well!  I was immediately greeted by the owner, who is Australian.  He got me a drink as soon as I entered, and I continued to walk around and observe.  He carries a bunch of wines, along with a great variety of accesories to go with it.  Corkscrews, books, wine racks, decorative items, etc.   Great selection of items.  I find that this place is really worth going to.  He has great hours, the place is well decorated, and has an original "feel" to it.  The owner guy says he's been there for about 6 years.  The only negative thing I have to write is that most of this merchandise you can find cheaper elsewhere.  (I got my wine rack at Cost plus Market for half the price he was charging.)  I noticed his wine selection was reasonable and large, and he seemed to have a fair selection for great prices.  But, as I mentioned earlier, things like corkscrews, wine racks, and general decor I felt was overpriced. Thats okay, I'm here for the wine anyways!

Ok, so we all know moving sucks.  Especially moving ones self...even if it is acoss town.  Anyways, I had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from Chandler to Mesa.  I was moving a whopping 12 miles, but I just needed a 10 foot truck to do one trip with to get my mattress, bedroom furniture, couch, and other random stuff to the new apartment.  Fine.  So, I go in the night before I needed it and made a reservation for the truck.  Fine.  I go back the next morning, to get the truck, and this is where I get upset.  I'm already stressed out from moving, its hot as heck outside, and I want to get this overwith.  Im the only person in the store and its 8 AM.  So, I go to the counter.  A guy helps me, who's name I will not list in this review, even though I remember it.  He's filling out the stuff in the computer, and asks me for a secondary phone #.  I told him I did not have one, and the only one I have is my cell number. Well, I guess that was a huge problem to him, and he basically snapped at me and said "look, I need a second phone number for you.  I'm just trying to fill out the paperwork!  Just give me your work number, okay?"    Crap. Now I've been scolded by the uhaul man for not having a second phone #, and clearly this is really screwing up his day, really bad.   Now, I'm the bad guy.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a fax number.  Yea, call THAT and reach me.  So, then, they go to get me my truck.  Well, guess what?  It has no gas, because someone siphoned it out overnight! So the guy says to me "did you want to wait for 15 minutes for me to gas the truck, or did you just want to take it empty?"  Why would I want to drive a uhaul that has zero gas in it???  So I can be stranded a mile down the road, and make this day longer?????  So, I waited for him to gas it.  Now, while I was waiting, and cranky counter man was gassing the truck up, two other employees waltz in.  I asked if they worked here, and they said that they are uhaul employees, but they are finance from corporate.  nice.    See, I normally dont get mad, but I was so stressed from moving, and after getting scolded, I had to complain to someone.  So, I tell finance that counter boy is very cranky this morning and scolded me for not having a secondary phone number, and I dont appriciate it.  They were like "uh, ok thanks."  Anyways, cranky counterboy comes back with the truck, which was nice by the way.  Clean, fast, and most importantly, with gas!  I take the truck, move my stuff, and return it.  I think he got told that I complained becuase I got a few bucks off the dolly rental that I had....plus, he was in a MUCH better mood this time.  I gave this place only 2 stars for the cranky counter boy.  But, the trucks were clean and neat.

I went here on a whim to see what this place had to offer.  Great little store with a wonderful selection of paper and products.  Its not huge, but seems to cover all the ground that one would need to get thier scrapbooking groove on.  They even had a lab to work in!  Lovely little store.  Closed on Sundays though.  yuck.

I normally am not a lunch eater.  I usually just sit and read my book on lunch, and rarely dine on anything.  Lately though, I have been eating out a little bit more for some reason, and today was no exception.  When I got off the light rail this morning, I spotted this BK on the way into the office.  I was like OMG must go here for lunch!  Despite it being 112 outside today, I did the walk from the AZ center anyways.  The place is decent considering its a BK.  Food was fine, tasty as always.  BUT, what I did notice was that in order to use the bathroom, you had to have a token, which can be aquired from the staff behind the counter!  I assume its to keep homeless people out.  I can't blame them!  Interesting though.  Anyways, will probably be back in the future, after it stops being so hot outside.

I came here after winning a gift certificate from a Yelp event not to long ago at the Breakfast Joynt.  Things have been busy, and I finally got around to making an appointment.  When I did call, the girl at the desk was warm and friendly.  She gave me a few options on a few different days, and I settled in on Friday July 3rd for my appt.  The place itself is attached to Golds Gym.  It has its own enterance, but also has an enterance from the gym.  FYI-If you have to go to the bathroom, you actually need to use the gyms restrooms and cut through the lockerroom to do so.    After filling out paperwork, I got a tour of the place.  Its warmly decorated and relaxing.  Blues and browns, which was pleasing to my eyes.    I got a tour of the place to!  The girl at the reception desk was nice and very helpful.  She showed me around and offered me some water.  Eventually, Liz came out and told me she would be giving me a massage.  She was really nice!  She made me feel comfy right away.  She did a brief consult, asking me where my problem areas were, and asked what kind of massage I wanted.  Being that I am not fluid in massage speak, I told her that I didnt want to be broken in half and to just work out the knots.    The massage itself was really relaxing.  I tend to get a pinched nerve in my back and she worked on that for a while which helped a lot.  Plus, working a desk job makes my back sore anyways. Came to find out Liz is a personal trainer as well!  Yippie!  Anyways, my massage was up and I left.  I would return in a heartbeat.  They told m that they have a thing for new members where massages are $40 for 40 days after your first massage.  But, whats the price after that?  I didnt look to hard, but I didnt see any prices on thier website about it, but I would come back here in a heartbeat.  I really enjoyed my experience here!  Thank you!!

I have eaten here before on several occasions, but its been a while since I dined in at Flos.  I like it here, though its typical chinese food.  Lovely menu, cool decor, service was okay.  I would come here again.  I split a dish with a friend was hanging out with.  Sweet and Sour chicken was good, and my friends lo mein noodles were exceptionally tasty!!!  yummy.  Great place for first dates, places to take parents while they are visiting here, or just a nicer dinner out then the usual. :-)

I have been coming here as a client on and off for the past 4 years, and absolutely love it here.  Canyon Falls offers a full line of services, not only for hair, but spa treatments as well.  I have used them for both over the years, and have been satisfied all the way around with everything.  This is more of an upscale salon....extremely well decorated, easy on the eyes and relaxing to be here for whatever services you may be here for.  I mostly come here to get my hair done, and thats what brought me in for my most recent visit.  I always see Maria when I am here.  Shes a really nice older italian woman who knows her stuff.  She listens, and does excellent hair.  The reason I started seeing her in the first place was because I was told that she deals a lot with curly hair, which is what I have.  Thats another reason I love this salon....if your a new client, and your not sure who to see, (like I did, intially 4 years ago) let them know what kind of hair you have, and they will place you with a stylist who has a strong background in that area.  Maria is awesome..she washed, cut and styled my hair in no time.  It only cost me $55 plus tip, and I looked and felt amazing!  This is not what I consider a "typical" Scottsdale hair salon....the people here are nice, welcoming, and professional...NOT your pretentious crowd that you might expect at other high end salons in Scottsdale.  If your looking for a great staff, with out the scottsdale attitude, come here!   Love love love the salon....will always return in the future, weather its for my hair, waxing, massages, or pedicures, you can't go wrong!

I've been here a few times over the past few years, and I have to say, its not half bad. Lots of shopping, food, a movie theater, and its close to the arenas that you can be in the center of everything for sports and concerts.  I will say, every time I come here it's never packed and I can't figure out why.  Parking is ample, and there's even a hotel on site as well!  This place is great to go to eitehr before or after a concert or a sporting event, as there's plenty to do. Go check it out!

I have eaten at this big fat greeks before, and after this mornings hellatious commute in on the 10, I thought maybe I should treat myself to some good food.  I sat in the bar area for a quick bite, since it was just me dining alone.  I was greeted by the bartender, who was more then happy to help me. I sat at the hightop tables versus the bar itself, since I had to make a few phone calls on my lunch hour.  I actually placed my order before I even sat down with the cute young bartender.  It took a few minutes for him to bring me my drink, but my food came quickly, which I liked. I ordered the spinach dip, was was quite tasty.  As I sat on the phone discussing this mornings happenings, the bartender was respectful, and was polite about me being on the phone.  He was attentive, kind and nice.  I liked that.  Knowing that this resturant is in a business district, and that a lot of people are on lunch hour, I think they do a good job of keeping things moving quickly.  Theres nothing worse then getting held up on lunch hour due to poor service.  I would gladly return to this location.  I do have to say, after eating at the other BFG in Chandler near my house last saturday, I do not have any excitement to write about in this post.   No resturant fires, bad dates, or cute fireman to speak of.  But, never say never, right?

Is heaven possible on Earth?  Yes.  How do I know the answer to such a question?  I came to Joes Farm Grill today and found it!    I am a fan of Joes stuff, and came here today to see what it was all about.  I really wanted to just go to the coffee shop, but after setting foot in here for the first time, I realized how close these two places were in proximity to each other, and decided to go to both!  I stood in line and ordered the hot dog basket and it was tasty.  I also got a drink as well, and really enjoyed my meal here.  I dont know how he does it, but this place is perfection.  Next time my parents come in to town, I'm taking them here.  amazing.

Would it be to forward to say that I want to live here, on premises? I mean, is that allowed?  I love this place. How did I live before coming here?  Do you think Joe would care if I made this my new home?  Love love love this place.  I am currently sitting in the back writing my review and never want to leave.  Joe, if your out there, your awesome.  this place rocks!

I was kinda hungry, and on my way out for NYE, and decided to pick up some dinner to keep the stomach quiet.  I decided on pei wei, and enjoyed my experience.  I guess its supposed to be a low key version of PF changs, and the food and decor was just as nice as the PF changs resturants.  Service was quick, location was clean, dinner was tasty.  I got the sweet and sour chicken, and the servings were huge!  I was expecting some kind of comprimise on serving size, for whatever reason, but clearly this was not the case.  I enjoyed my experience here, and would probably return if I was in the area and looking for a reliable place to eat.

After reading Jim's review of this place, I wanted to go check it out.  I cruised in there on Sunday, and was surprised to see that it was almost empty.  It was just me, one other girl and the guy behind the counter.  I have to say, I really liked this place.  Clean, decorated, comfortable and easy to manuver.  2 tops and 4 tops, theres plenty of seating!  The guy behind the counter was super cool and friendly!  I liked him.  They seem to have a real nice menu here, quite a few options of food and drinks.  I went with a cup of coffee amd it was TASTY! (coffee at a coffee shop? *GASP* I KNOW SHAME!)    Anyways, they also seem to have decent hours.  No late nights like the other places, but I like it enough that I am willing to drive a few miles to get here.

I came here this weekend to see Zombieland, and it was hysterical.  I've been to this theatre before on several different occasions.  Everything is clean, runs smoothly, and I have no formal complaints.  The theatre is comfy....great seats, big theatre area, and really not a bad seat in the house.  Will be back in the future!!!

I love this place! I've been here before in the past, but it was so long ago I can't remember when. I met a friend for lunch here today and what a great experience as always.  We got there at noon and there was already a 15 minute wait.  If you want a good parking spot, make sure to get there early. They have a really cute patio out back for sitting outside when the weather's nice, which looked awesome!  I think they also have free wifi if I am correct.  I also enjoyed the couches in the front for waiting, but since I was waiting for my guest I did not utilize them.  The menu here is really solid.  Lots to choose from with a vast selection of items.  I went with a burger with Cesar salad, and my friend went with a salad of her own.  We both love eating here, so it was really tasty.  I didn't have anything to drink from the bar, but that was because I had other stuff to do, so I had to hold off on getting hammered.  I would recommend coming here for anyone, because the menu cannot be beat, and the food is delicious.

Ive been meaning to come here and finally made it out Friday night with Daniel!  I consider him the sushi expert, and was finally ready to see what all the hype was about.  We came in Friday night and the place was dead.  I mean not a soul but one guy sitting in the corner.  Where was everyone?  We sat down and the server came right over and gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  They seem to have a decent drink menu here and we both ordered chocotinis.  The drinks came out and they were tasty!  YUM!!  Anyways, we ended up ordering some food, and whatever we did end up eating was delicous!  (Daniel the expert did the ordering knowing that I am new to this.  We did a few different things and they were delicious.)  Place is cute and well decorated.  Being a novice to this, I was happy with the taste and display of the food that we ate.  I really had a good time here.  As the night went on, we did end up seeing more people come into the resturant,  but that wasn't for a while.  Service was great, and overall I had a good experience.  Will return in the future.

This mall is so sad.  I lived near it for 4 years, and would come here on occasion for random things that I needed.  They had more of a selection when I first started coming here, but it was still kind of a dump even then.  Over the years, more and more stores have shuddered over time. I mean, it's not like there was a lot in here.  Now, even the Macy's is gone, which is kind of sad, because I would go in there from time to time to check out their sales.  I really don't know how this place stays open.  Honesty, I think this place is 10 times worse then Metro center, because it's just so vacant.  The outside stores that circle the mall are okay such as Best Buy and Dicks, and they at least still have the Sears and the Dillard's which has turned into a clearance center.  I don't feel scared coming here, but I have seen some shady characters here over the years. I stopped in here yesterday to see if it's still the same, and sadly, it is.  Not a whole lot going on.  There are plenty of better places to shop, and aside from a few occasional trips to Dillard's, I don't know that I would even bother going here if I were you.  I think if they put some effort into it, the mall could have a few decent stores to draw people in, but overall it continues to get worse.  My theory?  Either kick it into high gear and try to turn this place around, or shut it down already and do the city a favor.

I actually found this store on accident, and boy, am I glad I did!  It's got a great selection of clothing for reasonable prices.  They carry shirts, shoes, pants, tops, and a little bit of everything.  I really enjoyed the wide selection of stuff to choose from, and found that it was not only hip, but hit the spot for work and home.  Definately worth checking out if you want a great variety of clothing at reasonable prices.

Clearly, I should frequent here more often.  I was looking to purchase some alcohol to spike my Sonic slush I got during happy hour, and I felt like I walked into an adult Toys R us.  The selection here is huge!  Wine, liquor, beer and galore.  Great full selection, along with amazing prices.  If you sign up for a membership (which I understand is free) you get discounts off your purchases.  Prices are awesome, store is clean and well kept, and prices are clear and easy to see.  They carry a great selection of product, and even though I am not a drinker by trade, I feel like I could not go wrong in this place.  Shop here for good booze!

I came here for the book club yesterday, and I can't say that I will be back  any time soon.  The afternoon started off well, but ended in a general distaste for this place.  When I first got there, there was hardly anyone at the resturant, and it seemed like we got loads of attention from our server.  She was always coming over to us to bug us to order something.  I honestly wasn't that hungry, but I felt like I should order something, since the waitress kept coming over.   I ordered the American hot dog plate, and got fries and my coke to go with it.    Eventually every one else ordered, but one girls sliders order completely got ignored and never delivered.  When she mentioned something to the server, she seemed as surprised as we were.  It seems like after I food got delivered, that's when things went downhill.  For starters, the place got packed with people watching the USA/Canada hockey game, but I feel like maybe we got forgotten.  So much so, that I had to ask a manager to get our bill for us.  I also told him that we haven't seen or heard from our server in almost an hour.  then, when the bill DID finally come, we had to send it back to get split so we could all play our share.  I know its a sports bar, but it really lacked in service.  I think our table really felt ignored after while, with no drink refills, and having to flag down servers to even get our bill.  I don't plan on returning, as I was neither impressed with the food nor the service.

I live right near this place and have been wanting to check this place out for a while.  I am not a hunter or fisher, but do have an interest in the outdoors, and wanted to check this place out.  For starters, its HUGE.  Beautifully decorated, with ao much detail to everything.  It's obviously decorated in an outdoorsman theme, with animals everywhere!  (stuffed, of course.)  I learned that the animals that they have on display are legally obtained, which means that none were caught by bounty hunting but died naturally, and were taxadermied.  The staff here seems great.  I was greeted immediately when entering, and given a store map of what to look for.  (this is also when I recieved the details on all the animals in the store.)  While cruising the store, I noticed that they seem to have a huge variety of not only mens and womens clothing, but tons of different products as well, from home decor, to tents, and even some food in there as well!  This place is a trip, and worth the stop to check out.  Beautiful!

Chompies is always a nice treat for me, any time of the day.  I finally made it over to this location and carried out a sandwich on Sunday.  I thought the service was a little slow here, and I don't know if its always that way, or just the fact that I was in there on a Sunday night.  So, they lost a point for making me wait, and wait, and wait some more.  I'll say this.  I like Chompies.  I don't think thier bad.  But, for some reason, I don't think thier all that and a bag of chips.  I think thier the best Arizona can do for good traditional Jewish food.  I would take my parents here in a heartbeat, being the Jewish girl that I am.  And belive me, I grew up eating all this stuff and more, so I can tell you that I am a pretty good judge.  I think this is the best the Valley has to offer so far, for being close to Jew food.  I just know its not the BEST Jew food I have sunk my teeth into.

After going to their location on Mill, I wanted to grab some food from this location too.  I came here yesterday after my car got fixed, and was happy with the consistancy of the food.  Same tasty subs!!  Surprisingly, it seems to be a college hang out. I can understand the location on Mill, but this one?  Anyways, food is reliable and tasty, affordable and easy to access.  Will return in the future.

Ya know, this place isn't that half bad, but honestly, I don't come here to play the games.  I only came here to eat, and that was awesome.  I like it here, even though this place is an adult chuckie cheeses.  I can appriciate the fact that they have games n stuff, but I'm not into that.  Traditional menu, with burgers, salads, chicken, and an all around fair selection of stuff to eat.  I got the burger, but I dont remember what Austin had to eat.  Our server was Hillel, and he was such a wonderful guy, and paid attention to us during our visit.  I would return,  and had a good time.  Not bad.

Look, I love Target as much as the next person, and this store is no exception. It's huge, clean, well stocked and is close to my home.  It's located in the Christown mall, and I shop here from time to time.  I like that they have a grocery section here, along with a pharmacy, optical, a Starbucks and a pizza hut as well.  But, I will say, Target as a whole over the past few years has been letting me down.  Not this specific branch, but Target as a whole.  Sometimes I come here to this specific location and they don't always carry what I need, weather it's Target as a whole or just this branch.  For example, last summer I needed a new mop head.  I came here because I didn't want to go to Walmart, and looked around for the mop head and couldn't locate it. I asked the girl to help me find it, and they said they were out, and wouldn't have any more for several days. I hate to say it, but instead, I ran across the parking lot to Walmart, and they had it in stock!  Another time, I've come here for other random household items, stuff that should be easy to find and locate. I would find some of my items, but not all. I figured why only get half of my shopping list?  So I would put my items back and go to another store. Such items are 1 or 2 pound containers of sugar that they didn't carry (but they did have 5 pounds of sugar which is way to much for me), hair gel by Loreal..they would have the shampoo and conditioner, but no hair gel!   Another time this morning I came here for some large Ziploc bags for clothing storage.  I asked the girl where they would be and she walked me to the storage area and we could not find them.  They had the space bags that you vacuum out the air in, but not the other kind that I wanted with a zipper.  She was kind and nice, but said that if they weren't there she wasn't sure where they would be. I wandered over to the kitchen storage area in the grocery section and found them myself.  Why would they put them over there? I tried to find the girl again to show her what I was talking about but never saw her again, so I checked out and left.  Overall, I do like Target, but it's these gaps that make me hesitant about shopping here (or at any Target) more often.  I've always received excellent service here, but the lack of standard items, staff not always knowing where it is, and running out of random stuff happens all to often.

I don't know why I waited so long to try this place, but I finally did.  I've been past Grand Lux Cafe a zillion times, but I finally came in for dinner last night, and I'm glad that I did.  Parking here can be tricky at Fashion Square, but I circled a few times and got a space. If your in a hurry, you can always valet in front of the mall, but since I'm a big girl, I decided to park the car myself.  I got a good space too!  I love how this place is decorated!  So beautiful!  Very much like Cheesecake factory in regards to decorations and menu items.  I was with my girlfriends from work, and we all sat together in the dining area.  Bar area has adequate seating for smaller parties.  I went with the hamburger, and my friends went with the lettuce wrap and shrimp pasta.  Bread here is delicious!  I wish they had served more butter with it, but I lived, so it was okay.  The only thing that sucked was when we recieved everything on one check, and had to wait an eternity to get our server to come back to our table to split the checks.  Aside from that, everything here was awesome and delicious!

I've seen this place from the bus and now the light rail when coming into work for a while now.  Friday, I got stuck working very late, and my boss took me to dinner when we were done with our project as a thank you.  She wanted something mexican, and close to the office.  She said that she loved this place, so she took me here.  Walking in, I liked the decore of this place.  Authentic looking, and seemed cute!  Thats where the niceities stop.  We walked in and were seated.  The service was absolutely HORRIFIC.  I was blatently ignored, but my boss was waited on as if she were the queen.  I have a theory about why, but I dare not write it down here, for fear of backlash.  I had to scream at the server halfway across the resturant when he refused to take my drink order.  I was astounded!  When he took my order, it was as if he were doing me a favor...horrible.  Food was HOT.  So spicy that I was unable to eat it.  Why cant they state that in thier menu?  My  boss thought it was hysterical because I turned 7 shades of red from the spicy-ness.  lol.  Anyways, the next day the food was better from my fridge, I just wasn't expecting a mouth full of spicy hot food.  lol.  Anyways, I will not be returning to this craptastic shithole.  Never again.  Service was aweful, and the food was just WAY to spicy for me.  I can get Mexican food just as decent with substantially better service at a spice level I can handle at about a zillion different places in this town.  Stay away from this place! Its horrible!

I love BBQ, and am new to the scene in regards to dining out at different locations trying to figure out who's BBQ makes me the happiest.   Lucilles definitely has it going on. Its a large restaurant and its well decorated. PLENTY of seating for all different sized parties.   Blues music playing in the background.  Remarkably, Patrick (my Sunday date guy) and I had no wait whatsoever.  Usually, when I see this place, theres always people waiting outside.  Not this time!  they served us a basket of biskets.  um, but only 2 biskets were in there.  um, WHY?  WHY ONLY 2 AT A TIME?  That was annoying.   We didnt like that!!  Why couldnt they have given us at least 4?    They also served us our drinks in Mason jars.  I think thats a southern thing?  I liked it!  Eventually our food came out and I got the brisket sandwich with garlic potatoes and Patrick got the shreded chicken sandwich with Macaroni and cheese as a side.  We passed on desert.  Anyways, I would come back here.  It was a decent time had by all.

Ok, so I was starving, and found myself wanting a cheeseburger badly.  This place seemed so promising when entering, but overall, its mediocre at best.  I ate at the bar, and the service was mediocre.  The gentleman who helped me seemed alright, but something was lacking.  I can't put my finger on it, but it was lame service, ya know?   Somewhere in between lack of entusiasium and bland.  The food itself was okay, and I guess if your at Tempe Marketplace, and are dying for a cheeseburger (like I was) I would say 'lets just go here.'  I would not go out of my way to dine here.

Ok, I admit, I'm not a huge natural foods person, but its hard to deny Whole Foods goodness.  For starters, they have a great fresh fish selection, especially the smoked whitefish, my absolute favorite.  They also have a great prepared foods counter, where I buy latkes. (those are potato pancakes.)  They have a wide variety of food to choose from, and you dont have to be a health nut/vegetarian to shop here.  Everything seems fresh, and the store is huge, clean and well organized.  What I don't like, is how expensive they are.  Pricey

Wow!  I just went to putzy's and I was impressed with what I experienced.  Upon entering, I found the decor to be warm and inviting.  Red, yellow and green walls with really cool light fixtures.  The place seems to be well taken care of, clean, and nicely decorated.  There were quite a few menu selections to choose from.  Its a chicken and steak joint, and seems to have a solid selection of good food.  I ordered the caddyshack basket.  This came with 3 chicken strips, fries and texas toast.  The chicken was HUGE.  I couldn't finish the whole thing.  My fries were hot and tasty, and seasoned perfectly!  You also get a choice of two sides to go with your entree.  I went with the BBQ sauce and ranch.  Food was good and hearty.  I want to say it almost had a southern flair in there, and I liked that.  Worth checking out. Portions are huge, prices are totally fair, service was awesome.  Plus, if you get the putsys cup, and go back, refills on your pop are only a buck.  They also have steak items on the menu, which is awesome.  Great food at great prices. Wonderful atmosphere as well.  They even have a great outdoor patio to dine on as well.

Went here for the first time today, and had a really good experience.  Staff was friendly, normal, helpful and nice to be around.  The restaurant itself is moderately spacious, with bar and table seating.  Food here was awesome!  Combined with the service, I will be back.  I could tell that this place has a ton of regulars.  I liked that.  What a great gem.  The food was tasty, fresh and reliable.  Menu had a great selection of items, with a variety of choices and combinations.  Entirely breakfast, probably one of the more overlooked places in town.  Just finding this place now and love it.  Amazing service, great menu.   Parking here is tight, but a staff member guided me in the lot to show me where to go and park.

This was my first time eating here, and I was happy with what I had experienced.  Daniel had suggested it on the way to the Yelp event, and I liked the idea.  This place is located within the Tempe Marketplace Mall, so you won't actually see it from the road.  When entering, we were immediately greeted by the hostess.  She asked how many were in our party, and I told her two.  We were seated at a table, and asked if we had been here before.  Daniel had, but I had not.  I am familiar with this sort of dining, but had not been to this particular chain or location to experience what the place was about.  Basically, the jist of the joint is that you prepare your own meal.  There is a buffet style setup with lots of raw ingredients.  Meat, steak, pork, chicken, etc.  There's also loads of veggies and spices to choose from, to make your meal complete.  Take as much (or as little) as you like.  What I really liked was that they had reciepe ideas on the wall.  this made it easier for someone like me who couldn't think of anything in particular that I felt like making at the moment.  After you assemble your dish, you give it to the guys at the grill.  In turn, they give you a number, and put it on your table.  When your food is done being cooked, they walk it out to your table.  I liked that! No waiting by the grill, especially with it being so hot here.  I don't remember what Daniel had, but I had a beef and veggie dish that I made myself.  Tasty!    I would gladly return to this location again, and enjoy thier dining.

This is a brand new grocery store at Ray Road and Kyrene.  They have many valley locations, but this one is closest to my house, and I love it!!  Its small and intimate, with a great selection of fruits, vegetables, meat, chicken, fish, and prepared dinners.  The prices are rock bottom, and I really had a great time here.  It's very clean, stocks name brand groceries as well as store brand stuff as well.  Store is clean, well maintained, with a parking lot and is extremely low in what they charge for food. If you like Trader Joe's, you will love it here.

****3.5 STARS****  I came here Friday night for some dinner and to meet up with an old friend from long ago who was in from out of town.  I had never been here before, and thought it was worth a shot.  I wanted some place nice, but not to pretencious, so we came to crust.  The place is really nicely decorated, classy, simple yet elegant, and pleasing to the eye.  If I lived closer, I could see coming here for a glass of wine and a small appitizer during happy hour or early on a Saturday evening.  The place is on the small side, but they have a decent seating arrangement making the most of thier space.  The place seems to fill up quickly, so if you left waiting, your stuck hanging out on the sidewalk.    I really liked their wine and alcohol menu, and the staff seems to be educated and knowledgeable from what I could tell.  Menu had a great selection of food, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I ended up getting a glass of Reisling wine with a dish of Macaroni and Cheese.  I know, Mac and Cheese you say?  I wanted to keep it simple, and was really eyeing the filet mignon sliders, but decided at the last minute to go with the mac and cheese.    I will say the Mac and Cheese was good, but I wasn't blown away. I don't regret getting it, but I wasn't taken aback by it.  The presentation of it was nice, but I think it came out to crispy on the top.   Service was quick, friendly and professional.  Great for dates, fussy parents (like mine) or a nice night out with a girlfriend.  Menu selection was broad in dishes and prices, and decor was pleasant and relaxing.  I would reccomend stopping in and checking this place out.

Came here for a sub and left with a big ole smile on my face!  Firehouse subs totally hit the spot.  They serve hot subs, and was amazed at how good they tasted.  I had the #3 which was roast beef and pastrami with all the fixings.  They do have a great selection of hot sauces here, but I didn't try any of them.  The subs here come in 2 sizes, 8 inch and 12 inch.  Prices are actually quite reasonable, and I feel like I got a lot more then I paid for.  Tasty bread, a filling meal, and enough sub to make me happy.    They even sell their pickle buckets here.  Their those big drum looking things that are probably hold at least 5 gallons of goods for $2.  I guess the $2 goes towards a fireman's charity or something, but either way, its for a good cause.    Anyways, this place is worth checking out.  :-)

How can you hate a place that sells wall to wall booze?  You can't!  I like having wine around the house anyways, but this time was different.  I am having Thanksgiving dinner with a girlfriend of mine and shes a red wine drinker.  I only have white wine in my house.  So, off to Bevmo I went.  I have been to Bevmo before, just not this location.  I had to drive through Tempe Marketplace, unfortunately, as the McClintock entrance was closed...I had to enter through Rio Salado.  UGH!  Why they had it all blocked off is beyond me.  Anyways, once I was in the store, everything was great.   Bevmo is always so clean and organized!  wall to wall wine and all kinds of other booze and booze accesories as well. I could just spend tons of money on nothing here.  I had some questions about red wine, and the guy who helped me was knowledgeable and paid attention to me.  He asked a few questions, and led me to the section of where I should be to get the right kind.  Overall experience within the store itself was 5 stars.

WOW!  I finally ate here for the first time Saturday night, and was impressed with my experience here.  I have been wanting to try Famous Dave's for a while now, and finally got the chance to experience some wonderful food.  I am addicted to this place!  My friend Angie and I walked in on a Saturday night and were greeted immediately by the hostess.  I was also thrilled becuase there was no wait! We were seated immediately and offered drinks by the server.  Mind you, I have never been here before, so the menu was new to me.  We both took the time to review it, and the waitress also explained to us how to order.  They have meals for two with lots of food, entrees that are large as well, and also smaller sized meals (which I went with) that are more BBQ sandwiches of sorts, in case you don't feel like pigging out.  I really liked how they had big "family meals" with all the fixings.  Makes me think of a place back home in MI I used to eat at with my family when I was in college.  I went with the BBQ Brisket sandwich, and it was delicious!  It came with 1 side, and the roasted garlic potatoes.  Delicous!!!  YUMMY!  I devoured every morsel of it, and my friend liked her Brisket entree as well.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE how they have a HUGE selection of menu items! Chicken, brisket, beef, pork, everything a girl could dream up!  Service was marvelous, and food was worth every bite. I could never get sick of this place.

*sigh*  Why did I come here?  I think it may have been the lack of coffee in my system, or maybe the heat has gotten to me already.  I really had such high hopes for this place, and honestly, I feel a little depressed after leaving this joint.  For starters, I feel like the place is wwwaaayyyy overpriced for what thier serving.  I don't think thier food is anything that special, and for being a bakery, thier bagel selection SUCKS.  I really wanted a bagel and coffee so badly, and I walked in there, and all they had was like a few bagels saran wrapped in a basket on the counter.  WTF??    I then stared at their muffins for a while, and contemplated the meaning of life.  While doing this, I finally decided to order since my stomach was poking at me to put something in it. ugh!    So, I got  a blueberry muffin and a small cup of coffee for $3.83.  That was 3.83 to much!  The coffee was okay, and the muffin was mediore. It felt really heavy in my arm taking it to the table, and I think I hurt my shoulder doing it.  My shoulder hurts anyways, but the heavy muffin just aggrivated my pain!  Anyways, while I was sitting in a booth drinking my coffee and 1 ton muffin, a busboy walked by my table and asked me if I was doing okay, and wanted to know if maybe I needed a glass of water.???  Do I look that bad?  I mean, can you tell my shoulder is killing me?  Do I look sick? *sigh*  I told him I was fine, and continued reading my book and eating my muffin.  This place does have a great amount of seating, and I like that.  Booths, tables and the like throughout the place.  You could come here with people and not feel like your tripping over anyone. Bonus for that!  I finally left.  Thank goodness for that.

After my usual spot closed down, I found this place after making a few friends at Recollections before they closed thier doors.  I went in for the first time today, and I liked it.  They have plenty of paper, some ribbon, stickers and other scrapbooking supplies that you will need to work.  The store was neat and clean, lab had plenty of work room, with die cut machines and good lighting to work under.  No charge for lab time, and they do offer scrap nights for the usual $15. Open crop nights are Friday and Saturday nights, with door prizes and dinner.  Please check with the store for class times and schedule.  The staff here is great, and extremely helpful.

This is my "go to" Costco for all of my needs.  It's the closest to my home, and I'm here on a regular basis to get all sorts of things.  I love Costco for all same reasons everyone else does.  This location is like all the others in the Valley-ample parking, good hours, free samples on Saturdays, and of course, the hot dogs.  I get one every time I'm here!   I also like Costco because now they have their coupons loaded onto the membership card when you check out.  I found this out a while ago, when I picked stuff up that was on special, and the discount came right off at the register, without me having to whip out any coupons.  Makes life easier when you forget stuff like that, or when your stopping in and forget to bring the coupons with you.  Overall I like it here, easy in easy out, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  My only complaint about Costco as a whole, is that I find some of their selection limited.  No name brand cat food, (Kirkland brand only), no 40 ounce Nivea in a blue bottle (they carry the skin firming crap in the white bottle, but I don't use it...I use the regular lotion in the blue bottle.)  They used to carry this stuff years ago, but since I've become a member again, it seems thier stock has somewhat changed, and I'm kinda dissapointed about it.  Overall, Costco rules, and I love shopping here.  Always on my short list of places to stop for just about anything!

This place is pretty darn cool!  The place has an open layout, and the staff here is friendly and cool.  Kind of a modern look to it.  It seems like that even though most of the fun happens inside, I got the feeling that you can take the party outside as well.  I thought I saw a few people hanging out by the front door, as I entered and as I left.  If it gets to loud inside, and you really want to talk to someone, it seems like you can carry it outside as well.    The had some really cool belly dancers, and that was impressive.  Seemed like a great place.  I would love to return.  On the downside, the food was okay, not bad, but not awesome.  Plus, they really didnt seem to have a huge wine selection.  I got the impression that thier bar is more liquor based then anything else.  Thats fine, but for me, I think I'm turning into a wino, and I have to get my drink on from time to time and mix it up!

I haven't eaten at Jason's Deli in a few years, and I felt like doing something different this afternoon for lunch, so I swung in here.  I went with the Yankee half sandwich, French onion soup and a drink, which was quite tasty.  I also got free ice cream at the end! I don't remember them having free ice cream the last time I was here, but dang, that was good.  Overall the place is good.  It's not a traditional Jewish Deli since they don't offer a lot of Jewish foods, such as Gefilte fish, borscht or anything like that.  The sandwiches are big and tasty, plenty of items to choose from and they seem to have a decent salad bar as well.  Overall I liked it here. Not a half bad place.  I will say the staff was nice and friendly, but I got kind of annoyed after a while.  Why do you ask? Well for starters, I'm sick to death of being asked to "fill out a survey" when I'm placing my order to "tell you how I'm doing  UM NO.  I yelp about it, and that's my input.  I'm not signing up for your stupid survey online to win a free cookie/gift card/dumb thing because you want my feedback.  QUIT ASKING.  Secondly, I got asked no less then 5 times by 3 different staff members how my meal was going.  Please, quit interrupting me every 5 minutes to see how the last bite of food was.  IT GETS OLD.  Once or twice?  SURE.  5 times?  STOP IT ALREADY YOUR BEING ANNOYING. I want to sit here, read my book and enjoy the simple respite of having a meal cooked by someone else.  I don't need half the staff circulating hovering over me and my food to make sure that every single bite was scrumptious. I DEDUCTED ONE STAR FOR THIS ANNOYING PESKY BEHAVIOR.  Like I said, if something's wrong, I'll tell you. But more importantly, I don't need to be asked 5+ times if it's going well.  Overall, I like it here. Standard fare deli with a decent reliable menu with good pricing.

In lieu of my ongoing scrapbooking addiction, I am always on the prowl for new and exciting places to shop. I heard about this place a while back, and finally made it up to check this place out.   Its located off the Greenway-Hayden loop and Frank Lloyd Wright blvd in Scottsdale in a business type complex. its not your typical shopping mall store, and if you didn't know it was there, would probably never drive by it.   I checked the website out, and its a nice site. Hours, location, classes, etc. They have a nice selection of stamping stuff, stickers, and scrapbooking supplies to make any scrapper or stamper happy. its not the biggest store, but definitely carries quality supplies. They offer classes and workshops, which is standard for most places these days.   Something I noticed about this place was they didn't seem to have a Saturday night crop....only Friday night crops. That's surprising to me as most scrapbook, okay, all the scrapbook stores I know do Friday AND Saturday night crops. I'm not sure why they would do that, as most of these classes are very popular. That's something that's a bit of a turnoff to me as I enjoy going to weekend crops, especially during the holiday season to get caught up on my own stuff, AND do other projects as well.   Also they have a lab upstairs here. I don't know how that works with getting supplies, but for as cool as it is, I don't know that climbing stairs 700 times to get supplies really excites me. I know its out of their control, as its not a custom built location for them, BUT it could pose issues to those who may have walking issues or whatnot. For me, its more of a general observation and could be a problem for others.   Overall, I enjoyed my time here, and will likely return for supplies in the future!

I've been meaning to come here for a while, and finally had the oppurtunity last night with one of my friends.  I love these kinds of places!  It's a wild west themed place, with a bar, resturant and lots of outdoor seating.  I ate in the resturant and split the sirloin tips, which were tasty! Service was wonderful, and I loved the atmosphere.  Relaxed, easygoing and fun.  Prices on drinks and food were fair, and the it was well worth the drive.  I would gladly return, as I think this place is pretty unique.  I had a good time and will be back in the future!

I came here completely on accident. I  wanted a sub, and as usual, Port of Subs was closed on a Sunday.  (dam you port of subs!)  I was driving around trying to find something to eat, and I came across this place I have never tried before.  Its right off the 202 and Rural Road.  Went inside and reviewed the menu, and thought I would place an order.  The menu has a reasonable selection, but its not huge.  Some wraps, subs, and thats about it.  I ended up ordering the turkey and roast beef sub.  I asked about the sizes, and thier sizing chart is so odd! Its like 5 inches, 8 inches or 15 inches.  weird.  I went for the 8 inch roast beef and turkey sub.  I really liked the sub.  It was tasty!  YUM on the bread!  I found it to be flavorful and delicous!!!  But, I found this place to be EXPENSIVE!  WTF $10.35 for the 15 inch sub, before tax?  seriously?  I dropped a few bucks on my 8 inch sub, but I guess the prices were higher then I would have liked to see.   I agree with Andrea that I think this place is a little overpriced.  I will say, the service was wonderful when i was there...but slow.  Even though the staff was extra nice and extremely helpful, I felt like I was watching my sub being made in slow motion.  I would eat here again, easily.

After spending the day with my friend Austin, we were starving and came here for lunch.  I've never been here before, and or my first time, I have to say it was pretty darn good.  Upon entering, there's two Julios....we went to the smaller one that seems to be more of a fast casual type setting....self serve nachos, fountian pop, and you place your order at the counter.  The other julios is more of a sit down resturant with servers...we wanted a more casual dining experience, so we kept it to Julio toos.  I went with the Burro enchilada with shredded beef, rice and refried beans.  Prices here were awesome, and I got a ton of food.  Austin went with the mini chimi's, and I tried a few and they were tasty!!!  yummy.  I have enough leftovers for dinner, and was quite full after finishing my meal here at lunch time.   Place is small, well decorated, has an outdoor patio and a wide variety of menu items to choose from.    Will be back in the future for more.

I went here last night to meet up with a girlfriend that I grew up with.  We haven't seen each other since we were kids at camp, and we ended up dining here.  I guess this place has two seating areas.  One appears to be more of a restaurant, and the other seems to be more of a bar area.  Both are upscale and classy, but I am not sure why they split it up.    Anyways, the resturant area was jam packed, but our party sat in the Bar north location.  We sat in the patio area.  Fortunately, they had heat lamps to keep us warm.  The menu here seemed to be fine, with pasta, pizzas, and a more upscale choice of food.  Great alcohol selection to choose from.  I went with the angel hair pasta and marinara sauce.  The waiter informed me that I could add chicken or shrimp to my dinner.  I went with the chicken.  The food came out and it was well presented.  The salad that my Girlfriend had seemed to be a small portion, which didnt impress me.  it was like a spoonful of salad.  My dinner was actually very tasty, but the chicken that came with my pasta was whole, and I had to cut it up into chunks. I guess thats fine, I just found it odd that the chicken was not mixed in with the pasta?  The food was tasty though!  I inhaled it!  Anyways, I really liked this place, but the service was just okay.  Our server sucked at refilling drinks. I had to ask him twice for water, and remind him every single time that my pop was running low.  He never once took it upon himself to refill my water. I hate running out of beverages, AND having to ask for refills!  The place is very well decorated though.  Nice interior!  Will return, since its worth my time, but a little pricey.

I really like having a pita jungle close to my house!  I ate here last night for dinner, and it was tasty as always.  I ordered my 'usual' pita, the gyro.  yummy!  Service was wonderful.  My server was kind, and recommended a few things to try that were made with gyro meat, after I told him that I don't think I mix it up enough sometimes.  They have a seperate bar area here, and its off to the side.  Seating is open, spacious, clean and looks like all the other pita jungles that I have been too.  Tasty as always!

NEVER USE THIS SERVICE!  Last summer, I was going to turn in my Jeep because my lease was up.  I had some scratches on my bumper that needed to be buffed out, before the car went back.  I searched yelp and found this place, and decided to give it a go.  I intially called and talked to Claudia in May (I think that was her name) and said that her and her husband were the owners. I told her what I needed and I would like to set something up to get my bumper buffed out and fixed.  She told me that I should hold off on doing the work until the month before I turned it in so that way in case another scratched happened, I would have to pay her twice. (my car was going to get turned in around September, FYI)  Claudia also said that she only services Scottsdale, and that I need a driveway to fix my bumper in.  I told her that I live in an apartment, and wondered if she had an alternative location that I could drive to, and have her work on my car.  She also stated that she will not drive down to Tempe, since she ONLY works in Scottsdale, and that the 101 was to far for her "service" to drive.  Um, really?  (red flag #1)    Claudia also told me that if since I was an apartment dweller and lived in Tempe, I would have to meet her at her storage shed in Fountian Hills and she would do the work there.  Anyways, a few months went by, and it was finally August.  It was time for the car to get fixed.  I wanted it done before labor day so that way I could turn the car in sometime in September.  I called Claudia since I had already spoken to her before.  She remembered me, and told me that she would be unable to help me.  I asked her why?  She said that the storage unit mgmt had changed in July, and they wont let her work out of it for customers like me any more. (really? Red Flag #2) She said unless I had a friend who had a house and a driveway to work out of, then she would not be able to service me.  Personally, I think Claudia is a fraud.  She was misleading, and I dont trust her response about the storage shed. She claims to be a mobile service company, but picks and chooses where she wants to service.  Plus, her storage shed line I thought came across as a bunch of BS.  She blew me off the first time in May telling me to wait, then told me in August that things changed on her end with the storage shed.  Dont waste your time with this one. EVER.

It had been some time since I've had a facial, and I figured it was time to get one again.  Summers here in the valley can be brutal, with temps reaching 115 for days in a row, its dry as a bone most of the time, and there's always a bit of dust in the air.  I've found that since moving here, with all the sweating, dirt, sunblock and stress, you really have to take care of yourself or else it catches up with you.  After searching around, most places here charge an enormous amount for a facial.  On average, I've seen them at about $85.  (some places more, some less, depending on a variety of factors.)  Somehow, I found this place.  It's close to home, has great hours, and its AFFORDABLE.  After reading the reviews, this place consistantly gets between 4 and 5 stars, and I thought, what the heck, I'm gonna treat myself.  So, I made an appt, and finally rolled in this morning.  Boy, was I glad I did!  This is place is awesome! Even though its a school, and a student does your work, it has the feel, and is run like a traditional spa/salon, but at half the price.  They have 2 different types of facials, the $33 dollar one and the $45 dollar one.  I went for the $45 dollar one for myself.  It was a full 60 minutes, and the girls here are really professional.  I was greeted immediately by the desk staff, and I only had to wait a few minutes for the girl who did my work.  She explained everything to me that she was doing throughout the facial.  I got 2 masks, some exfoliating was done, and my skin looks like a million bucks.  I got a shoulder and foot massage, along with a few other great treatments as well. I feel so refreshed, and my skin looks great.  If you have the chance, stop by here.  All the same great bonuses of the salon but at half the price.  I will be back for more, trust me!

So, my friend Angie and I were looking for a casual place to dine on Saturday night, and I suggested we try Pizza a Metro.  I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.    So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!    So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.  When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.  When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.  We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.  Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.  Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately.

I attended the Yelp event here, and I was happy to say that I really liked this place.    For starters, I think all thier ice cream is made on site.  Kind of like how Cold stone is.  They have a variety of traditional and non traditional flavors, both in ice cream and I think sorbet or gelato flavors.  If you have a hard time deciding between flavors, they will let you sample to help you decide.  I chose to get the rocky road ice cream.  I have to say, it was tasty.  It was not heavy tasting, and went down easy.   It was good! Portion size was appropriate, and my favorite part, the pricing was fair.  I hate to openly compare businesses in reviews, but I will pitt this place against coldstone, in regards to similar resemblences.  What makes this place better then coldstone, is the mere fact that A) thier not as expensive, B)  I felt like it was more of an independant non corporate feel, C) they have a small but adaquate selection of ice cream to please most peoples pallats.  As for the location, its colorful with ample seating.  Its kind of long and narrow, but large enough to accomidate a group of people.  Also, the bathrooms are really pretty!  The menu is also easy to read, colorful, and its rather calming to enter this location.  I reccomend this place to just about anyone.  It sure beats coldstone any day of the week!

I haven't been here since my last review which was about 4 years ago. I stopped in today with a friend of mine who's a regular, and it was as good as I remember.  Decent selection of flavors, lots to taste, and prices were great.  It was a great treat after a nice lunch to stop in here and get a scoop of real ice cream.  We were entertained by some of the people who were here while we ate, and it was fun to interact with other patrons while we visited.  There was a guy outside trying to train his dog and give his wife directions to the store while we sat outside and ate our ice cream..that was quite a bit of fun to watch, and we had a good laugh.    Overall, I still like sweet republic and should probably stop here more often when I'm in the area.

Ok, so I went to this place on Saturday night with a first date.  Its located inside the Tempe Market place sortof near the theatre section.  So, I get there, and its a late date.  Like 10:30 PM.  On a Saturday Night.  They had a few security people checking ID's, and after I did that and got my hand stamped, my date and I went and got seated.  The place was half empty!  There were people at the bar area, and a few seated throughout the rest of the resturant.  So, we sit down.  For some reason, service took forever here.  My date went to the bar and ordered drinks, but eventually the server came by and took it for us.  (he was waiting for a while at the bar.)  I guess after a certain time they only have a limited menu.  So, we ordered our food.  He got a burger and fries, and I got this bread with stuff on top of it.  His burger looked delicious, and my bread looked appitizing and was tasty.   Another thing I disliked was that there was some kind of band playing here...and it was really really loud.  I mean, I personally am not a band critic, but it was really annoying, and loud, and I couldnt carry on a conversation or be heard.  So, not condisive to enjoying a dinner.  Anyways, I cant say that I would reccomend this place, the food was okay, but the service was SO SLOW, and the music was super loud and annoying.  I dont plan on returning anytime soon.

I haven't been to this Red Robin in a while, and I came back with a friend of mine this afternoon to meet up for some food.  What a good time!  It was busy for a Sunday afternoon, but fortunately we didn't have to wait.  We were seated in the bar area and our server greeted us promptly.  We already had the menu's at our table, and after scouring it, I went with the fries.  My friend went with a chicken salad, and I her sister went with the fish and chips.  Overall, our food was tasty, and I really had a good time.  While we were busy gabbing, our server always refilled our drinks, and after I bill came we had our bill split.  She was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed our time here.  I will say, the handicapped bathroom was out of service when I was there, and it was a bit messy and needed attention overall.  Nothing horrendous, but could have used someone to go in there and clean up the towels on the floor and mop some.  Overall a positive experience and I had a good time. Will be back when I'm in the area again!  Oh, and happy hour all Sunday long!

This Home Depot is probably the closest one to my house.  Now granted, I am an apartment dweller, but I still need stuff from places like this from time to time.  I had done a few trips here last summer when I moved into my place for hand tools, light bulbs, a sunshade, and a few other random dance moves that I needed to get through the insanity of moving.  Now that moving is long behind me, I just come here for the usual light bulbs or drano.  I love this place becuase they have awesome hours, and are close to me.  I really have no complaints.  I actually came here for a face plate for an electical socket on my wall that broke.  It was a cheap plastic cover, and I decided to fix it myself.  Its easy enough, and there was really no reason to call apt maintainence for something like this.  So I went, and they had a nice little selection of covers.  I just got the simple white one, and paid and left.  I found the service to be very helpful here, and would return in a heartbeat.  gotta love my depot!

I came here yesterday with Megan for a pedicure and I'm glad that I did! I've known about this place for a while, and it's located in a great little shopping area.  We had an apt for 12:45 and we got there a little early.  They do everything here, hair, nails, you name it!  The staff is really friendly and took great care of us.  We went into the back room where they do the manicure's and pedicure's and got set up at our station.  We were offered a few different type scrubs and I went with the mint. I don't remember what scrub Megan got but I know she liked it!  We chose our colors and I went with a deep red and Megan went with orange for her fav football team!!!  They had us soak our feet and started working on us right away.  The ladies who worked on us were so good, I feel like I really got taken care of.  My feet look awesome, and I feel great. Mind you, I have extremely dry cracked feet, and they hurt at times.  Mostly the damage is on my heals, so I always tell the pedicurist to take extra care.    But you know what's awesome?  Here's where they won me over:  she recommended a repair product called glysolid to fix my heels and even used some on my feet to help fix my cracked nasty heals. Why is this a big deal? Well, it's simple.  No matter what product I've used it's to "over the counter" and to weak to fix the damage that has ensued after living in sandals for 8 years in the valley of the sun.  My heals used to be worse back in the day, but since I'm good about getting pedicures, they've gotten somewhat better over the years, but my right heal just won't fix itself.  No other pedicurist has ever given me a product recommendation to actually make a difference. I could actually feel the cream working while it soaked in at the chair.  If you get a chance, spend the few extra dollars to come here and get your feet did.  You will thank yourself later and be glad that you did.  Thank you megan and Madison day spa for being awesome and helping me look at feel better!!

My Jeep was in desperate need of a very thurough cleaning. I am normally a compulsive clean car gal, but I had let it go over the summer with all the craziness I had going on.  I have been to Danny's before, just not this particular location.  This place is located within the Tempe Market Place, and is clean clean clean!  I love how thurough this place is with thier washes.  It takes a little bit longer then other car washes, but I know they will do a good job, so its worth the wait.  I ended up choosing the $14.99 wash, which means I got my tires armoralled, air freshener, and a few other goodies for my Jeep.  The service was good, and it took about 20 minutes for everything to get done.  Fortunately, there was not a huge line or anything, so this wash went quickly.  I love how they have a variety of different packages to choose from, and I think they also have some ala carte options as well, which is a bonus!    The only thing I dislike about Danny's is they have a reputation for pushy employees and upselling, which I do NOT like at all.  I actually did not experience this at this location, but please be careful, because it happens here!  At other locations, they have tried to sell me stuff like windshield stone chip repair, oil changes and rediculous package upgrades. I don't take to that, and I want what I want.

Wow!  I love this place!  This location just opened in the valley not to long ago, and its located off the US60 and Greenfield Road.  Its really easy to see from the road, and huge!  Upon entering, the place was well lit and so organized.   They have tons of stuff.  Artwork, floral, pictures, fabrics, and all sorts of goodies.  Everything here is well organized-loads to look at as well.    They seem to have regular sales as well, so keep your eye out.  Worth the trip, and much better then I had expected.

ok, so for some reason, my usual wifi spot/coffee shop was not open last night, or this morning.  weird. so, I was forced to take matters into my own hands, and find a new place to plug my computer in and drink coffee until my 'usual' spot decides when to reopen.  so, I thought I had seen this place from the road.  Its on Southern, in a strip mall, tucked away.  This place is a cute little treasure!  Its well decorated.  Has an artsy feel to it.  Has artists paintings for sale on the wall, with some really cool couches to sit on and get your drink on.  Theres also stainless steel tables in here as well, which I love!  kind of a modern chic feel.  Comfortable classy atmosphere without the stuffiness!  Clean, eclectic, without being dirty or drab.    They have all your usual coffee shop drinks with a decent range in prices and sizes.  THey have ice cream shakes, italian sodas, organic coffees and some teas as well for good measure.  The location itself is not large.  Rather small, but well done with ample seating and space.  They also have a few outdoor tables and chairs as well!  They have 'free' wifi, but only after you make a purchase.  I went with a choclate muffin, since I'm a little overcaffinated at the moment.  I was given the password and login info after I paid for my muffin.  Now, here is where they loose a star.  First, I had trouble logging onto thier network.  It wouldnt even show up on my wireless connection screen.  I asked the lady behind the counter, and she was mildly helpful, but she really didnt know what to do.  Mind you, I am primarily here to get on the internet, okay?  So she tells me that sometimes the connection here is weird, and said that sometimes the signal here is bad, and to move tables and try the 'otherside of the shop.'  Ive never heard of one side of a business getting wifi, and the other not.  So, I switch sides of the (already small) shop.  For some retarded reason, it worked.  weird.  now I am on the internet typing this review.  Also, as a side note, they lost a few points for another reason, and i will explain.  Normally, I dont usually pick up/evesdrop on others conversation while out.  Honestly, I really could care less, and unless its a screaming match, Im probably not listening.  When I walked in, these ladies were gossiping about something. Someone borrowed $10, and this one lady was pissed off about it becuase her friend that had borrowed the $10 hadnt paid her back.  These two women are discussing it, and honestly, I just thought it was such a personal conversation to be having in the middle of a coffee shop while your working.    Anyways, I really do like this place, despite the weird wifi connection, and most likely will be returning.  This place supports the training of Domestic Violence victims...Please go here and get coffee, as your money goes to a good cause.

I love port of subs!  OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.  They cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.  I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.  There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.  The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.  Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said "if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf."  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for.   Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of "If we had it, it would be out there."  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.  Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant.

I love Waffle House, especially for breakfast.  I usually get the same thing every time I come here, and its always tasty, filling, and really hits the spot.  This is my "got to" location for Waffle House's.  Not my favorite, but its closest to me for getting my fix.  I came here for the millionth time this morning, and got my 2 eggs over medium, hash browns and Cinnamon raisin toast with their apple butter spread.  Service was quick, and it was early enough that hardly anyone was there.  The only downside to this location is a two part thing.  First, their parking here is tight.  be careful!  If you drive a bigger car, or its busy, you probably will want to park a little farther back.  I've had to do it a few times myself, and its worth it versus getting hit or whatever in the parking lot.  Also, the place is located right next to the loop 101, and I've passed it more then once.  This is part of why its not my favorite location.  Aside from the cramped parking, it can be a pain to get to if your going during a heavy traffic time.  Kinda sucky.  I will be back in the future because I love Waffle house...this one has good service, but parking and getting in and out can be tricky at times.

This pool is awesome!  Kids are $1.00 to get in, adults are $2.25.  Pool has really good hours, and lots of room.  Locker rooms are ample, with lockers, bathrooms and changing areas, showers and of course, toilets.  Two swimming areas, one is more for the kids, and the other is for the adults.  There's diving boards, life guards, and several places to sit and lay out to catch some rays.  The only downside to this place is that its always packed!  Get here early to get a place to sit, as it fills up quickly.  Water is refreshing, parking is ample, and despite it being one of the busier pools in the area, is worth the time for the refreshment alone.

This coffee shop is located in the Mesa Riverview shopping district close to Bass Pro Shops.  It is a family owned coffee shop that has coffee, tea, and all the goodies that a coffee shop should have.  Plus, most importantly, they have free wireless internet!  They have wonderful hours, for your internet and coffee pleasures!  The only thing that held me back on giving them 5 stars is the seating.  They have tables and such, but the only comfortable seating is a set of couches.  The rest are square tables.  I do not find them to be comfortable in regards to kicking back, relaxing and condusive to extensive internet surfing.  Makes me feel like I am surfing the net at my kitchen table.  Otherwise, this is a great little location thats a non starbucks type coffee shop.  Wonderfully decorated with local artists artwork, clean, neat, close parking, and the service so far has been good.

I love the library.  This is my local branch, and frequent here often.  Membership is free, as long as you are a local resident.  Some of the benefits include computer usage, checking out books, all the local standard library stuff that you would expect.  What I love about this place is that they are open 7 days a week, and late during the week (I think until 8 PM.)  I love going here on Sundays to check my email on the computer, etc.  I think you can print here for 20 cents a page or something.  Plus, the staff here seems to be efficient and so far, has answered all of my questions when asked.

This Michaels location is within the Tempe Marketplace shopping center.  It's off the McClintock entrance, which makes it easy to get in and out of, without having to cut through the mall.  I wanted to give them 3 stars, but I am feeling generous today, and gave them 4 stars since I do save some $$ with thier coupons.  Ok, so I am a scrapbooker at heart, but also like to frequent these stores for other forms of home decor for my place.  This time, I was in Michaels for some decorative flowers, along with maybe some fabric as well to go over the blinds in my apartment.  I found the flowersI needed here, but not the fabric.  :-(  bummer.  The store is set up nicely, with most stuff sectioned off.  Baskets in one area, framing in another, scrapbooking off to one side, etc.  you get the point.  Bonus for having some form of organized layout.  I dig that.  They were having an amazing discount on some candles, plus, I used a coupon I had gotten in the mail, and it saved me a bunch of $$.   The best part of Micheals is that they send out coupons just about every week.  If you know you are going to be doing some shopping there for anything, check your mailbox before you do.  The complaints that I have about Michaels are the following.  First, this location does NOT sell fabric.  Its not the first Michael's store that I have found that doesn't.  I was upset, becuase that means I have to do another trip to a store if I had really wanted to get fabric for decorating.  I mean, most of the Joanns sell fabric in these parts, why cant they?  Secondly, the isles feel cramped and pushed together.  At times, it can be hard to navigate if you have more then one other person shopping in the same isle.  Don't even try to push your cart down the isle if someone else is there.  Thier literally wide enough for one person to squeeze down.  yuck.  I like my space.  It almost makes me feel like I need to take turns to look at stuff.  Anyways, I will always recomend Michaels, but to be honest, I would rather go to Jo-anns ETC as they are far superior then Micheals in my crafty opinion.

I've never been to this Applebee's before, and I think it's one of the sadder locations.  It was super busy when we got here tonight, and we were seated in a booth near the back.  I went with the triple sampler which came with two sliders, spinach dip and buffalo wings.  The spinach dip was almost electric green a really bright color.  The rest of the food was fine, but the whole meal was weird.  For starters, I had to ask repeatedly to get my sprite with dinner.  The server kept forgetting to bring it, and I was wondering when it was going to come out.  Also, My water kept running out and I started getting irritated since I was super thirsty today. It's not that I need the server to stand at my table with a vat of water, but I literally would have to flag someone down to come over after it had been empty for some time.  We also found a bug on the table during dinner, and I have no idea where that came from.  Service was good, but it was not the greatest experience I've had.  Not my favorite Applebee's at all.

This place is a dream come true for me!  I'm a fairly organized person and love having everything in a spot so its easy to find in my place.  Since I just moved, I was looking for a cute tabletop desk organizer to keep stuff like bills and important paperwork around and organized.  Since my other favorite store called storeables closed, I found this place instead. I  had no idea they were even in the valley! Shame on me!  Anyways, this place carries everything you could imagine.  Laundry stuff, bathroom, drawer organizers for the bedroom, office and just about everything closet organization you could think of.  I wandered through the store and really loved the selection. I've ordered from their website before but never been in the store.  They have great sturdy containers that I use for scrapbooking supplies, which I still have today all these years later.  Their selection 's amazing.  Lots of different styles, sizes and options to choose from. I was in the office section and noticed that they had a stackable office organizer, but it was to big for my needs, as I wanted something more compact to hold mail, clips, and a few other things to keep out on my table for when I do bills or have important documents that need my attention.  They had an entire aisle just for me!!  I found a cute little mesh wire organizer and I immediately knew it was mine! Plus, it was only $10!  Nice!!  Weather your crazy organized like me, or you just need help getting there, this place has something for everyone.  Don't be afraid to channel your inner diva at this place...guys included.  Staff here is awesome, friendly and helpful and will answer all your questions.  The guy at the register who checked me out was so friendly, and it really made my day.

OMG I'm stuffed.  I think I need a wheelchair to get around the office now...O gawd!  So my coworker took me out to lunch today, and this is where she took me.  Its right outside of my office, so all we really have to do is cross the street to get to it.  I've been in here before, and always love it.  Place is obviously well decorated.  Service is quick and friendly.  I liked thier menu selections.  ordered a cheeseburger, which came with fries!  I loved the presentation of it!  Fries came in a brown baggie!  My friends Mayo came in a tiny little one serving bottle.  Very pleasing to the eyes!     Food here is tasty, and delicious!  On the fancier side for having a burger, but Im not to much of a fancy eater these days. The burger itself was really delicious.  I got it with Cheese.  The only thing is that the fries were horribly oversalted!! UGH.  I couldn't even finish them!  My one coworker who eats here all the time said that the fries are always WAY to salty and is unsure of who to talk to about it.  Being that I dont eat here often, Im not sure either..plus, since Im not a regular, I dont want to go in there and be like "hey your fries are ALL ENTIRELY salt" and then leave....blah. Anyways...  Place was great, will return in a heartbeat!

I take the light rail into work every day, and have been wanting to stop at Sami's Gyros for a while now.  I finally got to!  yay!  Anyways, I was on my way downtown to the baseball game and was starving.  I had busy Saturday morning, and didnt have time to stop beforehand to get some food.  So, I boarded the light rail early and decided to stop at Sami's to try it out.  I was glad I did.  This place was great.  They have a great menu, and prices are reasonable.  It was rather quiet on a Saturday afternoon, but I was also in there at 3:30 and they close at 4 on Saturdays, so most people had either already eaten.  I got a Gyro, Greek salad and coke.  I think it cost me about $8.50, and it was more then enough for me.   Great serving size, I felt like I got what I paid for here, serving wise.    BUT, there were a few things on the Gyro that I noticed. I dont know if it was because I was there so close to closing time, or if this is the way that it always is, but the meat seemed a little dry to me.  I won't hold it against them, but it was probably becuase I was there so late.  Also, I wished they had put a little more of the sauce on the gyro.  I felt like that it was just not enough for me.   I also like this place beause its right off the light rail at the Priest and Washington stop.  Easy on, easy off.  I do recomend this place.  The service was good and I enjoyed my time here.

WOW!  This hotel just opened, and I have watched it be built from the ground up!  It's beautiful!  This hotel is located smack dab downtown in the heart of phoenix at 3rd Street and Van Buren, across the street from the Arizona Center.  I waltzed through the lobby, and it was geourgous. Staff greeted me immediately, and they have a tremendous amount of seating.  I would hope to stay here one day, as I can only imagine what the rooms look like after seeing the lobby!

I love Yardhouse!  TONS of beer and alcohol selection, great menu and wonderful service. I hate here today after shopping at the new outlet mall across the street, and decided to stop in at the last minute for a quick meal.  I went with a cheeseburger, fries, Dr. Pepper and french onion soup.  It came out really good, and I had a really good time here. I wish I would have been able to get something to drink, but I felt like noon was a bit to early to start drinking, plus, I didn't have anyone to drive me home, so I passed on getting an adult beverage.  I love how this place doesn't feel like a traditional bar. It's nicely decorated, and the service is always wonderful.  They offer patio seating here as well, and I wish I was closer to a yardhouse as I would probably spend more time here enjoying their huge alcohol selection.  This place is worth the shot, and I always have a really good time when I come here.

This is an Asian mall that has quite a few Asian stores and restaurants in it along with a few other businesses as well.  The place is always packed, and the grocery store in here seems to have a big draw to it.   Every time I'm in the mall, the grocery store is packed!  I don't come here often, but when I do it's not a half bad experience.  I walk through the mall, check out the grocery store and then go home.  They also have periodic fairs every now and then, which is kinda cool.  There's a few restaurants in here that I have seen that actually look kinda good to eat at.  I was in here Christmas day, as I usually am, and saw a Chinese place I wanted to eat at for Christmas dinner. We passed and went to a buffet across town instead.    I will say, that I did have a horrible experience in the food court here on Sunday.  My friend and I came in here after a movie to check the place out and were starving.  It was only 2PM, and we didn't want a full meal quite yet, but wanted more of a snack.  We hit the food court in hopes of picking up an egg roll, or a small cup of soup just to kill off the hunger.  What a mistake THAT was.  For starters, the tables in the food court were a MESS.  Disgusting MESS.  Every table had half eaten food on it in dishes that looks like it had been sitting there for quite a while.  It appeared that if you ordered a full meal here in the court, you got it in actual "real" dishes and not Styrofoam.  down side to that?  You can't throw it away and it has to be cleared by someone who works there.  Fine, unless no one cleans up the food court, which was the case when we were there. We actually found a table that didn't have a zillion empty dishes on it, and it was LOADED FULL of sauce stains, crumbs, and all kinds of garbage from who ever had eaten there before us.  Disgusting.  We sat down and ordered a plate of 4 egg rolls, and the place we ordered from said he would clean the tables for us.  10 minutes later, he still had not done so, and I had to go ask him to wipe down the table for us.  We dumped some Windex on it, and then left.  If it hadn't been that it was Christmas Day, I would have never eaten here at the food court.  It was disgusting.  But, it was to late at that point, as we had already paid and didn't feel like embarrassing ourselves and asking for it to go, or asking for our money back.  I only come here once a year, and that's about all I can handle for this place. It's just not my style, and after the bad food court experience, I don't really plan on returning any time soon.

I came here after grabbing coffee across the street.  Walked inside and loved it!  Kind of like a Fresh and Easy setup wise, but much nicer, in my opinion.  Limited selection of items, but competitive selection of goods, fair pricing and staff was friendly.  I was also told that this place was owned by Walmart.  Interesting.  I wish some of thier stores were as clean and cool as this one.  Anyways, I didnt buy as much as I had anticipated, but will probably return when I am in the area.

Really great little unassuming place located off Thunderbird.  I've eaten here a few times now and it's really good food.  Plenty of menu options, clean, with booths that are big and comfy.    I get my usual when I come here, which is a Gyro, fries (sometimes) and a drink. It's always tasty and made just right.  They could put some more of the white sauce on it, but overall it tastes fresh and delicious.  They also have a few desserts, but I usually never get any because I'm so full when I leave.  I really enjoy eating here from time to time, probably one of the better places to get a good Gyro in town.

Last night a few of us wanted to go out and have dinner and drinks.  After hitting up a few spots, we ended up here because most places were packed due to the UFC fight going on.  Even though I'm a regular at Chandler Fashion Center, I've never eaten at Majerle's.  Figured we may as well check it out, and, well, I was kind of let down some.  When we entered, the place was packed.  Not only because it was Saturday night, but the UFC fight was going on, so there was a million people in this place.  The hostess asked if we were here for the fight or not, as it would determine where they would seat us.  We told her that we were not here to watch the fight, so she seated us outside.  That was fine by us, since it was mostly empty on the patio.  Our waitress was okay, but she mostly forgot about us during the evening.  She was nice and all that, but we never got our drinks refilled, and I had to go ask the hostess to find her because we had waited what seemed like an eternity to get our bill.  Its never a good sign when you have to ask the hostess for drinks and your bill.  I was dissappointed with the service here because I kind of expected more.  Some could argue that it was a busy saturday night with a UFC fight going on, but the server dam near forgot about us.  She even walked by our table at one point and after I tried to get her attention, she never saw or heard me calling for her, and kept on walking!  FAIL!!  I mean, I guess the big bucks were inside watching the fight....blah.  I don't know that I will be back again, but for a sports bar, its actually kind of nice.  Just don't expect to much for service when going here.

I came here with my Sunday date guy, and I had a good time.  It was late, and we wanted something simple.  We ended up coming here because it was open, and neither of us had been here before.  I liked the fact that Sunday, from 4-10 is half off everything!  The entire menu!!!  We had a great meal there, and it cost us $14.50.  Loved it!

I ended up going here to Sidebar on NYE with another fellow Yelper, Corianne.  This place is located downtown, believe it or not, on top of a Starbucks and Pei Wei!    We all ended up going upstairs to the bar, and I was impressed with the decor from walking in.  Very sheek, modern designs.  Cool bar stools, and a moving screen with lights behind it that was fun to look at.  Its a more narrow area for the bar, and slightly larger area for seating.  There was plenty of seating avaiable, but it was very casual...couches and benches and the such.  We went to the bar, and ordered a few drinks.  I looked at thier drink menu, and realized that it was alcohol only.  NO FOOD whatsover here!  No appitizers or anything.  So, if your hungry, you need to pick something up before hand.  I hope they add something to eat here, even if its light food.    The Bartender was a very nice lady.  It seemed that they (or at least this bartender) was pretty cool about making stuff on and off the menu.  They didnt have a martini list, so I made up my own!  how cool is that??  Anyways, staff here was classy and cool, hip and friendly.  I would go again for happy hour, and its worth a little drive for a nice downtown spot to hang out at!

I've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months I've been working at my new job.  This place isn't half bad, and its just like any other wendys I've been to.  Lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through, so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering.  They also serve breakfast here, and I've never had a bad experience yet!  In and out in no time!

I ran into Joanns this weekend, as always I was impressed!  Store was neat, clean, and well lit!  This place is amazing!  Joanns does such an great job with thier store layout.  Tons of fabrics to choose from, everything a girl (or guy for that matter) should need for home craft projects.    I like how Joanns keeps thier stores neat and clean.  Everything is in its own little section.  You don't have to run to 3 different parts of the store to find the same thing in 3 different spots.  All the frames are together, all the fabrics, paint supplies, etc.  Plus, every time I am here, the service is always friendly and finding a staff member is readily available.  They have been able to answer most of my questions, or at least give me an inteligent response to whatever it is that I am asking.  I do like shopping here because I do feel happier when I leave, and somewhat inspired.  You can't go wrong at this store.  Friendly staff, well organized, and seems to carry a little bit of everything.  Worth the trip every time.

I don't pretend not to shop at Walmart-because I do. It's easy, convenient, and carries just about everything I need.  Plus, the prices are pretty great, and hey, their almost on every corner out here.  But, I've found that some Walmart's are better then others.  Why?  I'm not 100% sure. Some are clean, some are not.  This one is probably high on the list of gross and disgusting lists across town.  I shop here because it's close to home and well, let's be honest some things can be found just about anywhere. I come here mostly for stockable home items such as cat food and litter, cleaning products and other household items.  It's not so much the clientele here as much as it is the state of the store. The first few times I came here I was like "Oh HELL NO I need to find another Walmart."  But now I just go when I absolutely have to.  The store feels dirty, disorganized and overall tired.    The bathrooms are constantly in a state of disrepair and they randomly shut them down for cleaning at the worst possible times.  If you try to ask the person cleaning that you need to go badly, they get rude and nasty with you. How do I know this? It's happened to me on more then one occasion where I've had to go badly and been told tough shit go to the back of the store.  I've seen it happen to women with kids where the kids gotta go and the rude bathroom attendant sends them away while the poor kid is sitting there squirming having to use the bathroom.  I've never had a problem with the staff or stocking here, but it is walmart so don't expect to much in that area.  Parking does suck, but it's not the main reason I don't like shopping here.  It's just a forgotten walmart, and I guess remodeling or cleaning it up isn't a high priority.  Overall, your better off driving farther to go to a better one, but I come here because its easy for me. I hate this location so much!

Ok, so after a round of shopping with my mom, we were STARVING.  Back when I lived in Scottsdale, there used to be a deli in this place, but since I moved down to Tempe, I didnt know that this place had changed hands.  Its located right off Northsight, next to Golds Gym, and a salon.  The place is warmly decorated.  wood decor, with warm red colors.  Very relaxing and refreshing to walk into.  The menu here is somewhat simple.  Part breakfast, part lunch, with a few options to those who are hungry.  I got the omlette, with tomatos, cheese and onions.  When it the food came out, it was so tasty!!  My mom had the crepes, and said it was the best crepes she has had in some time.   Best breakfast that I have had in some time.  Plus, our server was wonderful!!!  I would love to eat here more often, as I think it was worth the gas and time.  So far so good, as I would take my parents back here to eat, or friends, dates of whatnot.  Great clean place with great service.

Ok, so this place JUST opened for business.  I love greek food, especially Gyros.  This place has it all!  Its definately NOT a chain, and seems to be the only one in the valley. Yippie! Its located right near the cinimark movie theatre in the Mesa Riverview District.  So, after seeing a movie, I was starving, and really wanted a Gyro.  These guys were open on Christmas Day, which was wonderful.  Im sure the  business from the movie theatre helped.  I walked inside, and was warmly greeted by some of the employees.  They have a really great menu of popular greek items.  I got a Gyro combo, which came with fries and a drink.  I substituted the fries for a greek salad for an extra dollar.  The gyro was wonderful!  The prices here are extremely reasonable, (under $10 for almost all of thier dishes) and the food was excellent.  Mind you, this is NOT some fancy smancy dining joint, and is more of a casual dine in or carry out place.  Casual, yet delicous, and I liked that thier prices were fair, and that the place is NOT a chain.  Would dine here again in a heartbeat.  Service, food and price were all top notch!

I love this place! I've been to the other location, but not to this one since it opened.  I finally came for dinner, and am glad that I did.  Serice was great, friendly as always.  I had the Shepards Pie Pasty and it was delicious!  Very filling, and its a nice sized portion, so you walk away full.  I will be back, and always enjoy eating here!

So, I was looking to get a Yoga mat, and thought that Dicks would be a great place to go to get something like that.  I know this location is brand new, as I used to live right near it, and literally watched them build it from the ground up.  This location has amazing hours!  Open late most nights, and is right off the expressway.  you cant miss it!  Its in the same district as Ikea, off the I-10.  Anyways, this place is well lit, has a ton of parking, and is so well organized its not even funny.  Not a thing was out of place.  It has two floors, and carries a ton of stuff.  I cruised through the womens section of clothing, and they have shoes, running stuff, you name it, its there!   I was able to find the Yoga mats, and they had a little selection in the back of the store.  Did I mention this place is really well lit?  Anyways, they had a small variety of mats.  They also had a beginner mat set, that came with a video, a block and a yoga strap.  25 bucks!  most of the mats I saw were about 20 bucks alone, so for the extra 5 bucks, I sprug for the extras.  I think I got a pretty good deal.  While I was wandering around, a staff member asked if there was anything I needed.  Just talked to him for a minute about yoga mats, and he said that was the only spot in the store that they would be at.  Seemed to know his stuff.  I really like Dick's Sporting goods.  Well organized, amazing hours, well lit, friendly staff.  I will return in the future!

So, my friend and I decided to spend the day hanging out together on this side of town. We both needed to get out of the house, and go for a pretty drive.  While we were driving down the Carefree Hwy, we swung by and hung a left on Cave Creek road because its been a while since we had been to this side of town.  While we were driving, we parked the car in town and found this place.  I spotted it from across the street, and we ran in to get some food.  Place is cute, with a nice patio and plenty of seating inside as well. Mostly tables with some booths. It's a fast casual type place, so you go, place your order, and they call your name when the orders ready.  The food itself was really good. I went with the brisket sandwich with fries and a drink. My friend went with the half chicken, baked potato salad (which had sour cream) and a drink. the potatos were awesome! I wish I had ordered it as my side instead!  Brisket was soft and tasty, and my friend enjoyed his chicken a lot.  It didn't come with a ton of BBQ sauce on it (which is fine by me) and you can always add more from the BBQ sauce station that they have set up in the condiment area.  I really liked the condiment area because not only was it neat and clean, but it was well stocked. I also like that they have a decent selection of food to choose from as well.  Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. If your in the area, or want to try excellent BBQ, please, go eat here. Place is awesome! Patio is a great size as well.  Make the trip, you'll be really happy you did!

Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area that I have been to.  I enjoy coming to this location a little bit more then the others for a variety of reasons. For starters, plenty of tables! I've been able to find a seat here every single time I've come over the last few weeks and this makes me very happy.  Also, for the most part, it's really clean.  The one time I needed a table wiped down (it was busy and the customer was walking out as I was walking in) it was done quickly by the barista.  Staff here is friendly and outgoing, and seem to do a good job of keeping it that way.  Place is well stocked, bathrooms are clean enough, and overall, I really enjoy coming here.  Even though it gets busy at times, its a far better experience then I've had at other Starbucks close to me.  Parking's a little tight, so be careful getting in and out, and it's in a strip mall, so there's lots of cars coming in and out.  Even though its an extra mile from my house, its worth coming here.  Free wifi as with all the other starbucks, and they have great hours too!

I came here Saturday night for a comedy show that Amy D was putting on with several other comics.  This place is located in a strip mall, next to an AJ's off in a corner.  It was my first time here, and it had a nice patio for outdoor seating, right as you walk up.  Walking in, the place was large, with plenty of seating. Tables throughout the place, mostly 4 tops from what I could see, along with large booths around the back for larger parties.  Being that I came alone, I wasn't sure where to sit.  It was kind of open seating, but most of the tables were already taken by other parties.  I found it a bit awkward, even if I had brought a date or friend with me, because I wasnt sure if I was supposed to join other people, or just kind of stand around and hope a table opened up for me to sit at.  Minus one for seating arrangments.....not sure how that would work if I was with 1 or 2 other random folks where we would have sat....  Eventually, I found the rest of the group for Amy D's group, and I sat with them.  I had a total of 3 drinks that night.  2 cokes, and a summertime booze mixed drink.  Heres where I found another issue that kinda through me for a loop.  One of the people I sat with ordered a guiness.....the waitress came back and said they were all out! He ordered another type of beer, and they had that in stock.    Then, I ordered a docs iced tea, which is basically a long island.  The waitress came back to tell me that they were out of one of the alcohols to make it, and if I could order something else off the drink menu....ugh, how do you host a Saturday night event and run out of beer stock and certain alcohol stock?  I mean, thats kinda sad.  Poor ordering on mgmts part, really.  The service it self was awesome, and our waitress was awesome, but the alcohol thing really through me for a loop.  Plus, the whole seating thing kinda made me think twice about coming back on my own for any other shows they may have outside of Amy D performing.  The comics themselves were fun to watch, and it was a great evening out, but the seating and alcohol thing kinda did me in for this place.  I would only go back if Amy D was doing standup here again!

OK, so I havent spent a lot of time in Maricopa since I moved out here, so this part of the city is rather new to me.  Recently, I found myself down here, and wanted to grab some breakfast.  My date suggested that teakwoods had some good food, and that I should try it out.  Upon entering, I liked what I saw.  Yes, its a traditional "Grill and Tavern" in that sense, in regards to how its designed, but seems to cater to a breakfast crowd as well.  We both ended up ordering omlettes, and they were super tasty!  Big portions! yumyumyum.  Service was wonderful too.  I would return here again in a heartbeat.

I've been here a few times and it's not half bad. I mean, it's not the greatest goodwill store, but it's not the worst either.  It's sort of organized, but I feel like they don't have the quality stuff that I find at others. I did find a nice polo top here today, but I usually walk out empty handed when I am here.  The knick knack part of the store comes off slightly disorganized with stuff that feels broken.  The furniture feels tired and they never have the stuff I want.  When I say this I feel bad because it's the goodwill, not a Macy's.  But, being a thrift shopper, I find that this one's not the greatest location around.  I also expected more since it's in a nicer area.  I noticed today that some of the patrons seemed to be embarrassed to be shopping there.  Just my gut speaking here folks.  Overall, not my preferred valley location.  I've been to better goodwills in Metro Phoenix, and this one kind of falls in the bottom half.

I've heard lots of good things about Luci's over the past few years, and had it on my mental checklist of places to go and check out here in the valley of unique and cool places.  A few months back, they were on Channel 3 during their Saturday morning broadcasts.  Parking here's a bit limited, but not bad.  I imagine if you were to come here on a busy week night it might be different, but overall not bad.  I walked in and really liked what I saw.  Cute setup, with a little bit of this and a little bit of that. Healthy without the feeling of eating or being sold bark instead of real food.  I initially wanted dinner, but decided on a bagel with cream cheese instead.  Here's where they loose a star.  ok, so on their menu, they have a bagel, cream cheese and lox combo for $6.99.  It comes with the onions, capers, tomato's and everything else that normally goes with a plate like this.  Well, I told the girl that I just wanted something lite, and if I could get a bagel with lox and cream cheese only.  She told me it was $8.99?  um, Can't you sell me the $6.99 bagel lox n cream cheese thing and leave the capers out of it? Why the extra $2?  Maybe I misheard...but if I didn't, that's kind of weird!  Why wouldn't she just sell me the $6.99 one?  Anyways, I ended up going with just a bagel and cream cheese with lemon water.  Bagel was great, and the cream cheese with whipped and appeared to be made in house!  They also serve breakfast all day, which I thought was awesome!  Totally my gig, as I sometimes like to mix it up and have breakfast for dinner on the weekends.    Place is wonderfully decorated, staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  Bathrooms are pretty cool and clean for the most part.  I will say, I absolutely love how this place is decorated.  Totally my style.

Ok, so I found my Doctor totally by freak accident.  Last year, I was in need of some medical attention, and did not have a regular Doctor out here.  I checked with my health insurance company, and found this place.  There are a few main reasons I like it here.  First, they have several different doctors that practice here.  Their a team of sorts.  They also have 2 nurse practitoners that work here as well, that seem to be very qualified.  But, my selling point?  Saturday morning hours!!!  I now find that he convienience of going in to the Drs on a Saturday is wonderful!!  This office is so clean, and so modern!  When I last met with the Nurse practioner, she was willing to electronically send my script to the Pharmacy of my choice!  NICE!  I love this place! I found my new doctors office.

I came here for Breakfast on Saturday Morning, and had a pretty good experience.  I was there early, around 9 am, and was happy to see that there was not a wait to be seated.  The place was busy, but not chaotic busy, which is good.    My server was fine, but I felt that she was a bit overwhelmed.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this one.  I think she probably just had a lot of tables, and it took her a while to get to me.  Nothing horrible, but maybe it was slower then expected for what I would have expected.  I ended up getting a garden omelette, which came with a side of pancakes.  Tasty!  I also like how they have different syrup flavors.  Yum yum.  I would eat here again, and enjoyed myself.  Go IHOP!

I've always liked Andrew's BBQ, and ever since they closed down the one near me a while back, I've quietly missed them.  Last night I finally made it to this location and it was awesome!  I liked how this one's decorated.  They have upside down BBQ grills hanging from the ceiling as light fixtures, plenty of tables and other decor that really seemed cute.  I swear the menu was bigger then I remember!  The girl at the register was really nice and helpful, and took our orders after answering all of our questions.  I went with my usual, BBQ beef brisket with garlic mashed potatos as my side.  My friend went with the bbq chicken sandwich with the mac and cheese.  Both were tasty, and we had a really good time.  Love Andrew's, and will be back when I get a chance!

TEEKAY TEEKAY TEEKAY TEEKAY!!!  I love Toby Keith's Bar and Grill!  I've been coming here on and off for a while now, mostly on Friday nights after work.  Toby Keith's is pretty cool for a country bar, and I really enjoy my time here when I come in.  It's clean and quite large!  The bar is in the shape of a guitar, with plenty of seating throughout.  One half of the place is more of the bar, with a stage, and a fancy sitting room where I think is reserved for special band appearances.  I've seen people in and out of there, but only on occasion.  There's also a great patio area, with plenty of outdoor seating.  They have a bull you can ride, two nooks that sometimes are rented out for bachelorette parties, taken up by radio stations, or whatever else you would want to use a group setting for.  I really enjoy my time here, but on the down side, they don't have great happy hour food specials.  Their drink specials are okay, but nothing on the food.  :-(  Great live bands, service is so so, and its an awesome place all around.  Give this place a chance if your in the area.  Its an awesome, clean large NICE country bar!!

Every so often, especially in the heat, you just need to treat yourself and your car to a full service car wash.  I've been here a few times before in the past, and I like coming here for a variety of reasons.   For starters, even though it's not fancy looking on the outside, but they are a full service car wash offering a variety of different services.  I like that I normally don't get the high pressure salesman that I used to get at other full service companies, and I really appreciate that about this place. That doesn't mean that I don't get offered a wax, or a shampoo upgrade from time to time, but none of the high pressure tactics is what I like.  You can get a punch card for some free stuff if you get like 10 or 12 washes, but I don't come often enough (like 3-4 times a year?) to punch anything. It would take me forever!!  They have a lobby here with some massage chairs for a $1, a decent amount of seating inside with some car stuff for sale like air fresheners, drinks, etc.  They also have benches outside for you to sit on and wait while they dry your car off.  Overall, I enjoyed it here, and the wait for your car usually isn't to bad.

Shopping in places like this motivate me to want to be more athletic.  Why?  All that equipment, and the organized, perfectly folded clothing makes me want to just scream with glee!    I do admit to shopping at places like this sporatically for random things that I cannot find elsewhere.  Plus, they carry LOTS of different sizes, colors and brands to choose from.  I was there on Saturday morning, and it was relatively quiet.  I was surprised by this.  Wheres all my athletes at?  I know your not sleeping! Maybe they were out excercising already??  Who knows.  But, I did have the place to myself, which was nice.  I just needed to pick up a quick pair of shorts while I was here, and I was in and out in no time.  I was happy with what I paid for my merchandise. (under $20!!)   Some of thier clothing seems to be pricey, but what sports store isnt??   Anyways, I will most likely be returning for other random things in the future!

Absolutely love this place!  Came here with a girlfriend of mine for lunch on Saturday, and can't rave about this place enough.  Decor is awesome, very sheik and modern.  Service was awesome, and food was tasty.    They have a great little menu here, and you get good food for a great price.   I went with a parlor burger, and they have a few nontraditonal toppings to choose from.  I cant remember what I got on top, but dang, its good!  Have I mentioned how much I love the decor here?  Service was AWESOME too.  Will return in a heartbeat.

On occasion, I have to stop at the car store to get stuff for my vehicle.  Granted, I'm not exactly a motorhead who works on cars, but I do buy stuff that I need.  Stuff like Windshield wipers, washer fluid, airfresher, and occasional car cleaners that I cannot find elsewhere.  So, I go to places like this.  I will say, I am not a fan of Autozone after the experiences that I have had here.  I've never gone in to get anything complicated, and its usually off the list that I mentioned earlier...washer fluid, wipers, etc.  All stuff that doesnt require assistance to find or get.  Every single time I have gone in here, Ive walked out frustrated.  If its not from the craptastic lack of service, then its from standing in line for 10  minutes to be told that I need to go to a different register. Every time its another knot in my stomach.  The last time I was here, was on Saturday.  The wiper blades on my Jeep were shot.  They died a long time ago, and with my road trip coming up, along with monsoon season, I wanted working wiper blades.  I have done this before, and its not my first time.  I'm well aware of how to purchase these things.  For wiper blades, usually they have a book hanging with every single make and model of vehicle.  You look up your specific vehicle, it tells you what size blades you need, and then you purchase said blades.    Well, when I walked in I was going to just run back and look at the book myself....customer service here is shoddy, and I can usually find it myself quicker.  But this time, I was actually greeted by a very cute guy at the door.  I told him what was going on, and he looked up my vehicle in the computer for me.  Told me I needed the 21 inch blades, and walked me over.    Everything was going so well!!  Then he told me he has a few brands to choose from.  I told him I wanted the cheapest brand, becuase A) my car is a lease, and I will be trading it in this fall, and B) its Arizona, and we don't get a whole lot of rain here.  He tried to talk me out of the cheap blades.  ($4.99 per blade versus the next brand up, $9.99 each) He was like "you don't want the cheap brand. They don't last, just get the better ones, thier worth the money."  Ok, but I dont want to spend the extra $10 on stupid wiper blades!!    I understand what he was saying, but I really didn't want or need the fancy wipers by Rain-X.  I wanted something cheap and reasonable. I could tell he was getting a little frustrated with me, but I'm sorry, I want what I want.  If I lived in a state that had 4 seasons, trust me, I would have upgraded and gotten the fancier, more expensive wipers.  But, its really not necessary out here.  I will say, that after I paid, he came out and put the wiper blades on my Jeep.  I loved that he did that!!   Honestly, I wish I could find another auto parts store in the valley. I really don't care for Autozone all that much, but its so close to my house, I guess I just go.

I did a lot of shopping during black Friday last week and purchased a few new outfits for myself to wear to work.  Being that Im somewhat on the shorter side,  I find that I have to get pants hemed alot due to my shortness.  I now have 3 new pair of pants that needed altering, and wasnt sure where to go.  This morning while running errands, I spotted this place.  I never noticed it before, and considering Im always at Gold Bar, I was thrilled to find an alterations place!  I guess shes been in Tempe for 10 years, but in this complex for about 7 months. (I must be losing my vision, considering I never noticed her before.)    Anyways, I just wanted to start out with 1 pair of pants to give her.  I asked her when they would be ready, and she said that I could get them back today if I needed them. I think she might charge extra for it, but after talking with her and comparing hours, it seemed easier for me to pick them up today.  She only charged me $9 which would be standard for her to charge for a hem.  She measured me up and off I went!    So far, I am happy with her.  The only thing is she closes at 5:30 during the week.  Being that I work full time, its impossible for me to get to her before she closes to get my stuff back.  FYI for others who may use her if your in a hurry and work during regular business hours.  Shes open on Saturday but closed on Sunday.   More updates to come as time goes on!

I am constantly at Mesa Riverview doing shopping, and have seen Angel Sweet Gelato about a zillion times.  Being that the weather is getting hotter, I decided that it was time to wander in and try this place out.  I was pleased to see that they had a small but nice selection of Gelato.  Everything looked well signed, clean, and appitizing.  Impressive!  The service here was wonderful.  Staff was wonderfully helpful, answered all my questions, and let me taste a few flavors before settling on thier vanilla flavor.  I did take out since I had to go home and do other stuff, other wise I would have stayed here and eaten it in thier store.  I will gladly return for thier tasty gelato.  The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because this location is NOT on thier website for some reason.  I guess they have two locations...and this is the second one.  Its been open for as long as I've lived in this part of town and thats been about a year or so.  They lost a star for not having this place listed, and I had to call thier other location to get the address info for this one specifically.  In this economy, I think you need all the advertising you can get, even if its putting up your address online.  FYI.

I used to swim a lot here when I lived closer to this pool last summer.  Since moving, I haven't found a pool that I liked, so I come here from time to time.  I do have a pool at my apartment, but I do like to take advantage of stuff like this to mix things up.  Anyways, the pool is easy to find.  Its right off the 202 on Kyrene on the West side of the road.  Its only a $1.50 to get in, which I think is remarkably cheap.  The place is great for kids, families, or anyone looking to cool off.  They have 3 seperate swimming areas!  They have a diving area with a couple diving boards.  They also have a kids swimming area with stuff to climb on that shoots out water.  They also have an adult pool where you can either swim laps or just hang out in the water.  They even have drink stations n stuff!  I drive here to swim, hang out and cool off when it gets to be hot out here.  If you check out the website, I guess this place also has classes for kids and adults too.

I love second hand places like this.  Its hard to find a good local shop that carries a great variety of furniture.  Im always on the hunt for stuff, weather its a lamp or something else good for the apartment.  I really liked the variety that they had here.  Lamps, couches, bedroom furniture, paintings, and a bunch of other stuff.  Great variety. I actually got to meet the owners, who helped me look around when I got in.  They are super nice people, and run a great store.  I really recommend stopping in and checking this place out!

Came here for lunch with Audrey on Sunday.  Its located within the Santan villiage, tucked behind the food court and next to the movie theatre, its easy enough to find.  Service was quick and efficient, and food was tasty.  Service was adequate, and I will return in the future!! Love the theme of this place.  :-)

I went to the new LoLo's location with other fellow yelpers to check this place out.  I had been to the location downtown and wasnt all that impressed with what I had seen, so I thought I would give it another chance.  This one was a much better time.  Upon entering, said parties were already seated.  I was happy to say that my experience here was much better then before.  This place is actually clean!  and has decent parking!  and, as a bonus, the service was substaintially better then the one downtown.  Same menu, same tasting food, but a better experience.  When coming here, expect to wait.  This place is super popular, and tasty.  Be prepared to eat!!

Holy crap, this Filibertos is fancy!  This is the one Filibertos that is actually *like* a real rest-a-rant-ae!  Most Filibertos that I know are little shacks, some with walk ups, some with drive thru's, some with both.  This one?  Actually has TABLES and an INSIDE!  HOLY CRAP!  Amazing!  I know this place has been open for a while, but never really went to this location since there's like a zillon around town.  I came here very early this morning after doing a 3 mile walk for MS with some of my new co-workers.  Fortunately, they open early, and I was hungry!  I cruised in here and was pretty much the only person here.  Same full menu that you would get at all the other locations, but this place actually has tables and a salsa bar.  They even have an outdoor patio!  *gasp*  I ordered the macaca (I think thats how to spell it) breakfast platter and man, was it HUGE!  I mean, I'm not a huge fan of Filibertos, but they do give you tons of really good food for a really cheap price, and its filling.  I couldn't even finish it.  I like that they have this sit down location.  It's a nice change for them, and makes me feel more comfortable instead of having to carry everything out.  I will gladly return in the future when I'm in the area, and its the nicest Filibertos I've seen since living here!

Ok, so I came here because I needed  a change of pace, and boy, am I glad I did!! Holy cow is this place NICE!  The inside is clean, nicely laid out with plenty of seating. They have a variety of tables, and a few set of couches in here as well.  They even have a really cool back room too.  This place is open early, but closes early too.  6AM to 3PM is what the sign says.  They even have a drive through!  They have really great prices, and are cheaper then Starbucks.  They also have a menu of breakfast items along with some sandwiches.  Menu selection is awesome!  I'm really glad I found this place.  Plus, the staff here is super friendly.  I just had a doughnut and it was tasty as all get out.  yumyumyum!!  Free Wifi as well!  Go get coffee from here now!!

I love Greek food of any kind, and am happy that I found this place.  Its a toned down, fast version my my big fat greek resturants....kind of like how Pei Wei is to PF Changs.  I had a really nice time here last night, and it really hit the spot.  I went for the Gyro as I always do, along with a pop and a Greek Salad.  I got all this for like $7.65!  Holy smokes!  I will be back again, and had a tasty dinner here that really made my tummy happy.  Totally worth it!

I've been a fan of Port of Subs since I moved out here to Phoenix back in 2005.  I love everything about them, and last night was no exception. It was Friday night and I was hungry!!!  But, of all the port of subs, this ones open nice and late.  9PM during the week!!!  In other port of subs reviews, I have openly complained about the horrible hours that the hold, such as closing early (like 6PM on week nights) and some are closed on sundays....others close at 4PM on Saturdays.  Really? lunch only? you can't do like 7PM?  So this one's my favorite just due to the hours alone.  I came here with my friend after hitting up a few other places. It's located right next to Lowe's in a little strip mall.  I went with the turkey and pastrami 5 inch sub as I always did, and really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly, and food was prepared quickly.  I will be back, and enjoy myself every time I'm here!

I was down here doing some shopping today, and saw that there was a Jersey Mike's in this shopping complex, and I couldn't have been happier.  I spent the most of this morning running errands and getting some shopping done, and had worked up an appetite.  I was to hungry and tired to go home and fix something, so I cruised into Jersey Mike's for a sub.  The place itself is clean!  Nicely decorated, with ample amounts of seating.  They have a few tables outside, but I ate indoors since it was a brisk 95 degrees today.  I went with the #9, which is the club (I think.)  It came with Turkey, roast beef, cheese, and all the toppings.   The menu listed that it also came with bacon as well.  Well, when I ordered, I told the guy NO BACON.  He was fixing a few other subs at the same time, and as I was watching him, I saw him put a strip of bacon on what I thought was my sub.  He also forgot to add mustard as well.  When I got his attention, I asked him of the sub at the end was mine.  He said yes, and I requested that he remove the bacon, which he did.  He also added my mustard, thank goodness.  Anyways, I got chips and a drink with it, and all around, it was tasty.  Not a bad deal, really. I'm glad I went!  I also got a cookie too, free of charge.  The guy who was running the register handed out cookies to us, as I think it was time for him to rotate a few fresh ones in.  He kindly handed me a white chocolate chunk cookie, and boy, was it good.  YUM.  I really like Jersey Mike's, and would gladly return in the future.

I came here to change things up and try a different place.  I really liked the decor inside, and there was plenty of seating.  I can see this place filling up quickly, as seating is plentiful, but not overwhelming.  Plugs are limited, which was frustrating.    They do have free WiFi service here, as long as you buy a cup of coffee.  They also have outdoor seating and a drive through!  Great hours too.  I think thier open until 8 or 9 at night and open up early as well.  I could see myself returning here on a regular basis!

After a morning of volunteering with one of my girlfriends, we decided to come here because its her favorite place and I wanted to see what this place was all about.  I really liked the interior.  It was decorated nicely and had a nice tropical feel to it.  They have colorful lights on the patios, and the walls are painted in a variety of different colors.  Its very festive in here!  We were seated immediately and our service was wonderful.  Drink refills were a bit on the slow side, BUT the service was personable and good overall.  I went with an appitizer becuase even though I was hungry, they seem to have larger portioned dishes here, and didnt want to be overwhelmed with an enormous about of food.  The main entrees tend to run about $10 on average, and they have appitizers with smaller portions for a little bit less.  Being that I was starving, but not wanting a humungous portion I couldnt finish, I stuck with the appitizer.  Food was tasty, and we also were given chips and 2 types of salsa dips to go with them.  Chips were warm and tasty as well.  You can also sit out and eat on the patio, but we opted to sit inside and enjoy the AC.  I would gladly return here for happy hour, dinner with friends or dates for that matter.

After seeing this place reviewed on Yelp, I felt it was time to stop by and check it out.  I'm a burger loving kind of gal, and am always on the hunt for a good peice of meat.  This place definately has it going on.  After finding a place to park in the garage, I wandered into Smashburger and was happy to see that it was a clean new place. Ample menu of items to choose from, with a small variety of burgers, a hot dog or two and some chicken options as well.  I was torn between the BBQ burger and the All American.  I went with the All American, and boy, was it good.  Good came out quick and service was great.  Ya know what else?  They had a bunch of Yelp pens here at the register!!  This brought a smile to my face! Yippie!  What I really liked about this place is the burger is juicy, and not dry or "corporate" tasting.  I didn't feel like it was to greasy either.  I found it to actually have flavor on its own as well.  Worth a stop here.  I should also mention that this is review #300 for me.  Ya wanna know what else?  I hit 3000 miles on my car yesterday.  Cool, huh?  Possibly a sign, but quite cool that I am doing review #300 and hit 3000 miles on my car in the same day.  Cool.

I came here with Joellen on Sunday, and WOW!! Place is awesome!  I really really liked it here.  Staff was friendly, helpful, welcoming, coffee was tasty as well!  They had the creme in these really cool "old school" containers, and place was well decorated.   I will say, they had a TON of seating!!  The only thing was, that after a while it wasn't all that comfortable, and I had to get up and walk around....bench seats were kind of hard on the rear end...but worth every minute we spend there.  LOVE LOVE LOVE This place!!!!

After hearing all the hype about this place, I HAD to go check it out.  I am always on the prowl for professional nice looking clothing at reasonable prices.  Ive been told that this is the place for such things.    This place is at Greenway and Scottsdale Road at a new upscale shopping center that they are in the process of building.  This place was a madhouse!!  Like going to Costco on a Saturday!!  I cruised the store and liked what I saw.  Nice clothing at an a completely affordable price.  Holy crapola!  I didnt buy anything because I try everything on before I buy.  The wait for the changing rooms was an hour and a half!! I think Im going to go back once things calm down and get me some new threads from here.  I like that they carry all sizes too!  I see myself being a regular shopper here.  Aside from the madhouse, once things calm down its going to be fun fun fun!

I finally made it here yesterday and really had a good time.  Its a chicago style menu, with mostly burgers and chicago style hotdogs.  I went with the chicago style hot dog, and it was very tasty and filling.  I was impressed with the fact that this guy made his own chili.  I loved it! very meaty and had just enough spice to make my mouth happy.  I will gladly return.  Plus, the guy who helped me was wonderful!  Yay for Lobbys!

I came in here wanting and expecting this place to be amazing.  I wanted this place to be 5 stars. ugh, I feel like a failure for giving it 2.  I've heard such good things about this place, and was expecting it to be good, but unfortunately, it was not.  :-(  I walked in and placed my order.   The menu seems to be decent enough, with a fair amount of selection.  Ample amounts of toppings, and you can have your burger a few different ways. Mind you, I'm a burger lover, so I'm always up for places like this.  I ordered a regular burger with all the fixings and BBQ sauce on top.  I got the fries too.  It came in a brown bag..I guess thats how they serve it regardless if you eat in or not.  I was dissappointed with the burger itself.  It seemed like it came with way to much topping. I mean, like an overwhelming amount.  I ate it, and the burger was okay, but not as good as I have experienced at other comparable places.  I wasn't looking to be "blown away" by the burger, but I wasn't really impressed over all.  It wasn't that great, to much on the toppings, and it didnt really do much for me.  I will say tho, you get a TON of fries tho.  I left feeling underwhelmed, and don't know that I will be back in the future.

So, I needed a pedicure-BADLY.  I've been here before right after I moved to this side of town, and I was lllloooonnnnnggg overdue for another pedicure like you wouldn't believe, so I came back!  I like this place even though its not in a glamorous part of town.  It's located in a sad looking strip mall, but dang, these guys do good feet, I swear.  The first time I came here, I had a guy do my feet, and he took extra special care, and they came out looking awesome. I get really dry skin around my heels, and it gets painful at times, and he was so careful not to hurt me.  I swear, my feet stayed smooth for the longest time!  When I came here today, I had a lady work on my feet, and even though she wasn't as gentle as the guy, she still did an awesome job.  The regular pedicure is $18, but for an extra $5, they will give you the whole schebang.  Hot towel on the legs, massage, extra scrubbing, the whole deal.  I know most places will do this, but I feel like they do such an exceptional job for the small price that they charge.  (I've heard of other places charging more for the same services. Why pay more?)  They also have a punch card deal, and after 7 punches you get a $10 gift certificate (which I will probably use towards another pedicure!)  When I come here, I never have to wait and I swear half the place is full of regulars.   AWESOME prices, great hours (even open on Sundays) and they even do manicures here too. Go check it out!

I have no idea what just happened. I came here for dinner and the place was vacant, with like one other party at any given time in here.  I'm not sure if it's because it's sort of in the hood, or because it's just not that good.  I've never been to a Bill Johnson's, but it seemed like a nice place all this time.  There's a few different locations throughout the valley, and I've never heard a bad thing about them before. They seem like a nice family style restaurant and I came here with a friend tonight for dinner for the first time.  I can't put my finger on it, but I think it was the food that didn't impress me. They seem to be a family style steak and potatoes type place, but the food wasn't all that good and it seemed a bit pricy. I think you get huge portions, but it wasn't all that good.  I went with the bbq sandwich with a baked potato.  It was okay, but seemed like it was cut up into tiny cubes with bbq sauce over it. It really didn't have much flavor to it either. I just wasn't all that impressed. I think years ago it used to be the best place ever, from what I heard, but I was kind of disappointed overall with the food and the high prices  mediocre food.

I came here for the first time last night with a girlfriend for appetizers, and was really pleased with my experience. Unforunately, we missed happy hour by only a few minutes, but we had a blast anyways!  For starters, I really loved the decor of the place.  Red chairs, tables of all sizes, with such a great atmosphere.  There's room to spread out some, so its not like your sitting on top of one another.  Menu selection and prices were great, and the place was jam packed!  My friend and I went with the shrimp appetizer and split it.  Order came out quickly, and the dish was so cute looking! Served with crackers, some sauce and some other stuff, we dug in immediately.  The shrimp was spicy! But in a good way...we both were surprised, but whatever it was marinated in had a nice kick to it.  Overall, I had a really great experience here. So you ask, why not 5 stars? Well, here's why.  First, parking here can be a bit tight. The later you go, the more difficult it will be to get parking. This is a very popular part of town, with lots of other locations around 5th and wine to hang out at.  There is a parking structure, but plan on doing a little walking in case you go for a late dinner.  (Really its not that bad, but if your in heels or the weather is poor, come prepared!)    Secondly, the happy hour ended at 6. UM, most people work and can't get there that early!  my schedule allows me to get their earlier, but would be nice if they extended it until 7, especially on a Friday.  Thirdly, our server was fine, but overall she didn't seem to take much interest in spending time at our table.  She would literally continue walking and ask if everything was okay without hardly stopping. Yes, I know its a busy Friday night, but she seemed like she just wasn't interested.  Anyways, place is great, I love it here, and I will probably be back for more in the future!

When I was in college, I used to go to this locally owned donut shop near my dorm, and later on, apartment.  They were open all hours of the night, and had a huge selection of pastries n coffee to choose from.  This place reminds me of that!  The pro's of this place are many.  It's locally owned, they have amazing hours, (5AM to 11PM if I am correct?) and are easy to find.  I think this place used to be a Taco Bell many moons ago, and sat empty for a long time....until these guys moved in.  Cons arent to bad, but I've only been there once, so I cant really think of any.    Thier prices are fair, they have a great selection of donuts and coffee, and even offer combos!  When I was here, I got the 2 donut and coffee combo and didn't even spend $4!  woohoo.  Will most likely return in the future!

I've heard of Cartel Coffee before, but I had no idea this place had just opened until one of the employees came to drop off some flyers in my office for free coffee.    This place is located right off the light rail on 1st street close to the light rail stop at the convention center (where I get off at.)  Place is open 7AM to 7PM.  Location is new, and has plenty of seating.  Menu is decent for coffee, but I noticed that they literally have NOTHING to eat at this location.  No pastries, bagels, nothing.  I assume its because they just opened.  Hopefully once this location gets up and running, they will have a regular stock of something to munch on.  I got a cup of coffee, and he made it fresh by the cup!  Holy crap!  NICE!  Coffee was perfect.  I really liked that.  Plus, the guy who helped me was really cool and nice too.    I will definately be returning here again.  Loved it!  O, and  they have free wifi too!

I came here last night for a bite to eat and to see what this place was about.  Overall, it was good, and the guy who waited on me was really super nice.  I ordered thier special, which was half a sandwich, salad and a drink for $7.95.   Food was good, and service was fine.  I liked it!

So, I was hungry, and I didn't want to cook. I felt like I needed some Chicken and waffles, so I came here today for some lunch.  It's a small little place, pretty simple inside with a great menu of chicken, waffles, kool aid and a variety of other menu items that are tasty.  Staff here was friendly and awesome and I had a really good time. I went with the Chicken and Waffle Combo for $10 and it was tasty! The girl who waited on me was awesome and even had a mohawk.  I'm happy, full and ready for a nap. I will be back!

I was driving back to my friends house that I'm dog sitting for, and saw that they opened a Jersey Mikes here.  I've eaten at Jersey Mikes before, just not this location.  I really liked this place.  They have great hours, are open late and have a nice variety of subs to choose from.  They come in a few different sizes, and are made to your liking.  The gal that helped me was really friendly and helpful, and was able to carry on a conversation while she placed my order.    I ended up going with the famous mikes, which was turkey, roast beef and all the fixings.  Quite tasty!  I will gladly return!

I love thrift shopping!  I've been to this store a few times, and let me tell you, I really like it here. Since I have today off work, I decided to cruise through here to see what I could find.  I didn't buy anything this time, but I have in the past.  They have a great selection of clothing, housewares and a bunch of other stuff.  I tend to do a lot of damage in the knick knack area, finding cool stuff for my kitchen, Yankee Candles and a bunch of other small items. I've even seen some really nice dish sets for sale here as well.  I like this store a lot.  They have a great selection, prices are fair and everything is well organized.  I think they take donations here as well, and your bound to find something here to buy.  Go check this place out! Not only will you find a great deal, but your helping people in the community who need it most!

I came here today after swimming, and was starving.  I saw it on the way to the pool and stopped in after I was heading home.  For starters, this port of subs has the best hours.  Every other one I've been to has closed at some ridiculously early hour.  This ones open until 8 on sundays, when others are either closed entirely or close at 4. Brownie points for being open "late."  (later then other locations)  Service was quick and efficent, and my sub was delicious.  I went with the #18 and it came out great.  Love port of subs, and will be back if I'm ever on this side of town again.

I'm always on the hunt for a good scrapbook store, and I've had this place bookmarked for quite some time.  I admit, I haven't been scrapping much, but with the holidays here, I figured it was time to get caught up on some of it, so I finally made it out here.  The place is nice, and I really liked it.  The front half is scrapbooking product, and the back half of the store is a lab area. I should also mention that they do pottery stuff here too!  I checked out their pottery stuff, and they have a nice selection of product on the shelf to choose from.  They have a lab for pottery and a seperate lab for scrapbooking, so technically, they can do both things at once, which I like.  (this means that if their holding a pottery class, I can scrap in the other room. It also means that you don' t have to worry about getting your scrap stuff messed up because someones splashing paint everywhere.)  The ladies here are really nice and helpful, and I struck up a conversation with both when I was here.  Really helpful and knowledgeable.  They have a great selection of paper, products, ribbon, and a bunch of other stuff to.  I also liked that they have a lab for $5..or, if you spend $5 in product, the lab fee is waived! I like that because some stores charge you $5 regardless if you buy stuff or not. Look, I'm going to spend money here anyways, and five dollars isn't going to kill me, but its nice to know that I'm actually getting work done and have a space to do it in.  They hold late nighters here regularly, and the lady invited me to do one this Friday. I was going to sign up, but I did not because I don't think I have enough scrapping to do to validate doing a late nighter at this time.  (this is what happens when you get caught up on everything.)  In closing, one of the better stores in town, and I really enjoying my time here.  I will say, that they didn't have a big dye cut machine like some of the other stores, or a big paper cutter either.  The only thing that I think they could improve on is putting garbage buckets on the table for scraps because when I was scrapping there, there wasn't a garbage pail on the table. Yes, I know, its not the end of the world, but thats the only thing.  I will be back in the future, and its nice to find a great friendly store not far from me.  Thank you to the ladies at this store!!!

Any exercise at this point is good, no matter where you go or who you are.  For me, I've done Yoga in the past, but I usually do Bikram, which consists of the same 26 poses in a heated studio.  Since I wanted to relive some stress and get Yoga on, Megan and I came here to have some fun together.  I've never been to this studio before, and we had a really good time.  The studio has 3 different studios inside. One appears to be a practice studio, the other one had people doing random stuff in it, and the third was where we held our class.  The studio we were in had wood floors, which was a first for me. I've never seen that before!  The lady who checked us in was really helpful and told us what to expect.  I rented a mat for an extra $1, and the drop in fee was $16.  I've seen other studios charge $18, so that wasn't alarming.  The lobby area was specious with some limited seating. We waited for our class to start and in we went.  Here's where things get confusing.  Okay, I thought it was going to be like my previous Bikram with the same 26 poses.  The poses here were totally different with only a few similar poses that I was used to.    The instructor was cool and did a good job keeping us focused, but I got lost!!!  I wish he would have done some explaining of what was going on. He would call out poses and I was wtf is he talking about??? Can you stand at the front of the class and give some of us an idea of what you are talking about?  Show us?  The other people in class totally knew what was going on, so I followed them for the most part.  It's not that the instructor sucked because he didn't. But, he knew we were first timers and I wish he would have spent a little more time at the front of class at least showing what some of us *cough* ME *cough* should have been doing.  So I struggled and tried to keep up.  Afterwards the instructor said I did a really good job, which made me feel better. I was worried that I had embarrassed myself but I did not. I got a lot out of this class, and feel like a million bucks right now.  Thank you Sumit Yoga for a good hearty work out!

I came here with a friend for lunch, and really liked my experience.  My friend arrived early, and there was about a 30 minute wait.  He got a tag thingy and waited for me to arrive.  When I got there, the place was reasonably busy.  I loved the decor, and the hostesses were wonderful.  After we were seated, our server took our order.  The menu is simple, with a few different options to choose from.  I wasn't feeling particularly fancy, so I went with a regular hamburger.  We also ordered sweet potato fries which were delicious.    Both of us had a really good time here.  The staff were really on top of things, checking in on us constantly and always refilling our drinks. I liked the decor too....I thought it was rockin cool!  I probably will be back in the future!

*sigh*  Initally, I gave this place a 4 star review this morning, but I decided that I needed to be honest, and share an experience here that I had that initally I had wanted to leave out, but now i feel that I can't.  I wanted to ignore what *really* happened, as it's been bothering me more and more and more as the day has gone on.  When I came here, the place was empty.  It was just 2 workers, and not a soul in sight.  Despite the food being good, the service here left me feeling angry and upset.  Here's why:  The guy that seated me, (and obiously worked here as some form of staff member) made it his point to flirt with me non stop, so much so that it actually RUINED my experience here, and I don't know that I will be back.  He was so aggressive in his tactics, that he actually had the balls to pull up a chair TO MY table while I was trying to eat and enjoy my dinner.  Mind you, I was alone, and trying to enjoy a good book and some quiet time...and this douche ruined it.  He sat with me through the majority of my dinner, asking me personal questions about if I was single, what kind of guys Iike, and other personal questions that I found grossly innapropriate.  I was so annoyed, that I actually had my dinner boxed up and left half way through, lying and saying that I had somewhere to be....just to get out of here.  I found it rude, annoying, and downright disrespectful that a staff member at this establishment made it his personal playground, and taking it upon himself to not only hit on me, but spend most of the time sitting AT MY TABLE talking to me discussing things that I found grossly inapporpriate.  Due to this experience, I will NOT be back to this location.  EVER.

I came here because I saw it from the road and wanted to give it a try.  I'm really glad I did becuase it was tasty goodness!  The layout is cool.  Has a few roll up garage doors that are glass, along with inside and outside seating.  They had a variety of flavors, and many toppings to choose from.  I went with the red velvet yogurt with sprinkles and strawberries.  Total?  3 bucks and change.  The people working here were young and upbeat, along with helpful and nice.  I would return, and really enjoyed my time here.

Who knew Ramen could be so much fun? I came here for the first time last night with John C, and I absolutely loved it!  Both of us had not been feeling well lately, and he suggested we come here to self medicate and that the food was awesome.  I loved it!    I really like how this place is decorated.  It feels comfortable, with benches and chairs, plenty of seating and a fair amount of room to move in.  No blasting music, very relaxing, but it feels clean and nice.  Anyways, I have never been here before, so in between my friend and the girl behind the counter, I was able to figure out what it was I wanted.  They have a ton of options, from meatless dishes, to stuff with chicken, pork, and even alcohol options to drink as well.   I went with a vegetable clear broth with chicken chunks, and my friend ordered a vegatarian thing since he doesn't eat meat.  They answered all my questions and gave me a lot of options to choose from.  Staff here is patient, and seems to not only know their menu, but take the time to answer questions to make sure your happy with what you order.  The food came out in a HUGE bowl.  It's like eating a hearty bowl of soup, with tons of good stuff in it.  I got through about half, and was STUFFED.  my friend ate about three quarters, and was stuffed as well.  We both have leftovers!  Total bill with drinks was about $20.  love it! I can eat a hearty meal, with left overs and not break the bank!  Will be back in the future, weather its just for dinner, or drinks as well.  Go here and try this place!

I was up here today hanging out and was hungry for something different.  I cruised past this place, slammed on my brakes, and whipped into the parking lot at a high rate of speed.  After throwing the car in park, I made a fast dash for the inside.  Something you should know about me:I love a good hot dog, and this place has em!    They have a great menu selection of Hot Dogs (ALL beef too....tasty!) sandwiches and burgers...AND the prices are AWESOME!  I got an all beef hot dog, with fries and a coke.  Grand total?  $5.34!   Plus, you can get booze here if you like.  They also have TV screens in here, and at the time, they had on some football games, which was nice.  It's a nice place because I feel like its relaxed enough to enjoy a nice meal with a friend here, yet not to barish or uptight that you can't relax and have a decent meal.  Plus, the prices are great too!  What a great way to spend a saturday afternon.  I would gladly return to this place...prices are awesome, food is great, and the place is not typical pretentious Scottsdale!  wooohoooo!

I have been to famous Dave's before, just not this specific location.  I came here for my birthday dinner on Saturday night, and was glad that I did!  Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by the hostess.  I told her that my friend and I were here to celebrate my birthday, and she asked if we wanted to sit in the bar or at a table.  I chose the table of course!  Travis was our waiter for the evening.  I  belong to the Famous Dave's P.I.G. club, so I had a birthday coupon for buy one entree, get the second one for free.  I told him this, and he said that I also get a free dessert since its my birthday.  FTW! YES! Who doesn't love free dessert?!?!? I DO!!  Anyways, I went with the Brisket dinner, and my friend went with the 2 meat sampler. He got the BBQ'd chicken along with the sausage.  We both got corn on the cob, 2 sides each, (I went with the coleslaw and garlic mashed potato's) and my friend got something similar.  O, and the Brisket? Done PERFECTLY as always!  Juicy, tender, and o so delicious.  Anyways, Travis was really warm and friendly during the evening, and they brought out my ice cream with a flaming candle on top!!!! YES!! They even emailed me a photo!!  MY LIFE IS AWESOME!!!   I love you Famous Dave's and will be back 10 million more times...

I was running some errands and figured it was time to go check out Rocket Burger's and subs. I've heard some pretty good things about this place so I stopped in and checked it out.  The place is located in a strip mall and actually kinda cool.  It's got a huge selection of pop along the wall, and has a great menu of items to choose from.  Prices are fair, and over all, it was a great experience.  I went with the Gyro burger with a pop, and it was out to my table in no time. Hot and tasty, and it hit the spot.  The burger itself was actually quite big, and stacked real high.  Pretty cool!  There's a reasonable amount of seating, with booths and tables like.    One thing I noticed is that they only have one unisex bathroom. I guess I'm used to a Men's and a woman's, but that's okay.  The parking lot was also overrun with teenagers for some reason, so I'm not sure what that's about.  There must be a high school near by, but they were just all hanging around, and some of them were in the restaurant as well. I guess it must be a fun place for them to hang out at!  Either way, if your on this side of town, and want something different and cool, go check this place out.  They seem to have something on the menu for everyone.

I came here tonight to see some friends before my trip in Phoenix comes to an end.  One of my friends suggested this place because he likes the endless fish and chips that they serve on Fridays.  I got here really early because I was driving from Awatukee and had the girls seat me at a table for 5 in the front of the restaurant.  She brought me out drinks and some menus to review before everyone showed up.   Eventually my friends showed up and our waitress came back to the table.  Here's where I got annoyed.  The waitress hung out at our table for 20 minutes.  So much so that she was chatting up a storm with one of my friends to the point that they were showing each other pictures of family members and exchanging stories.  My other friend and I sat there and talked while this went on, but we didn't understand how she could talk for so long and not get in trouble or have other tables to wait on.  Also, when my other two friends showed up they ordered Nachos.  They ordered chicken nachos and she brought out beef.  My friends were upset and sent it back.  Also, our fish and chips came out like 15 minutes prior to the Nachos, so the two friends who were splitting nachos had to sit there and watch us eat.  the waitress apologized but they were still upset.  Overall I will consider this a one time thing with the poor service.  I like their specials here, and think it's worth for that alone.  I will chalk this up as a one time experience and consider returning in the future. Unfortunately, since I live out of state, I can't come here on the regular, so that doesn't work to their advantage.  I gave them two stars because I feel like the food was good and they have lots to choose from, and are open for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  They also have a great outdoor patio which was busy the entire time we were there. They seem to be a really active bar with lots going on, including poker night when we were there. Granted, most of the people playing poker were old, but I thought that was kind of cool that they have regular gatherings.

Ok, I have been meaning to go here forever.  As a Jewish Girl, I like to know where to get Kosher stuff.  I really did not know what to expect when arriving.  The store was smaller then I had expected, but carried a full line of items.  The meat case is where I hung out at most.  I decided to not get any meat here, as I was more just kind of getting an idea of what they carried more then anything else.  They also have a resturant here, but it was being revamped, so it wasnt really open.  I was kind of dissapointed, but its only temporary.  The staff here is small, but personable and will answer your questions if you should have any.  Please do not be intimidated when shopping here-its not just for us Jewish folks!! Its for everyone!  I would return here in the future, but probably not on a regular weekly basis.  They have Challah, which I love, and one or two other things that I like to have around the house that are hard to find elsewhere around the Valley here at times.  You should also know that due to the Sabbath, the close early on Fridays, and are closed all day Saturday.  They are open Sundays though!!

I've seen and heard about this place since I've lived on this side of town and have wanted to come here for some time.  I finally made it in yesterday, and it was everything I thought it would be.  Delicious!  The menu is pretty good, and the prices are great. It kind of has a fresh and healthy feel to it, which is great.  I went with the steak wrap, and my friend went with a chicken wrap.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and overall I really enjoyed it.  I love how they serve the meal in a metal bread tray, and I thought it was super cute.  They had limited drink options, so I stuck with water.  Food was tasty and filling, and overall I really liked it here.  They have free wifi here, so its pretty cool that you can bring your computer, hang out and dine here while relaxing on the patio.  Total bill for two lunches was about $20.

Ok, so I love coffee, especially from places like Dunkin Donuts.  I mean, its how coffee should be.  Not over roasted burnt beans, at crazy prices served by people in green aprons.....just really good coffee, along with some donuts and muffins.  Apparently, this location just opened, and its exciting to see another DD in the valley.....the coffee is great, pastries are awesome, and its at reasonable prices, with awesome hours and wifi.   This place has a drive thru as well!  Parkings kind of a pain in the butt (small, cramped lot with crappy drivers and loads of people blazing through the lot to get to the drive thru.)  When I'm back in the area, I'll be sure to stop back in and hang out here, as its worth the time and effort!

I came here Saturday afternoon for the first time, and really am glad that I did.  I am always on the hunt for a good gyro, and this place definately has them.  I carried out just the gyro only, no drink or salad. I was going to sit down and eat in the resturant, but was so tired, that I decided to carry out instead.  The place was empty, except for one lady who was finishing up eating when I walked in.  Service was great, food was awesome.  I got a huge amount of meat with my gyro, and was extremely happy with the portion size here.  Will be back in the future for more.

I came here tonight to try something different and see what this place is all about.  In some ways, this place is not half bad, but in others, its kind of meh.  On the good side, prices are nice!  Buffett was $9.99 and drink was only a little bit more, totaling $11.97 for all the food you can eat.  Its all chinese food, so be prepared!  I tried a little bit of everything, and some food was better then others.  If you don't want to stay for the buffet, you can order carryout for a reasonable price, which is nice.  The Sushi was okay, but was a little on the dry side for me.  Had some crab, and that was alright, along with some really good fried rice!  yum on the rice!   The egg rolls were aweful, and at worst, the food is a bit dry from being out for a while and probably cooked in a mass setting, versus to order...like rand said, some of the stuff was a bit on the rubbery side, but edible.  Service was really really nice and friendly, but I had to hunt someone down to get a refill on my drink.   O, and they only have pepsi products here, so no coke or Dr. Pepper.  BBBOOOOOO!    Overall the food wasn't horrible....and I think the place is okay.  Decorated okay, with black marble looking tiles, plenty of seating, and an ample amount of food.

I came here after hearing about this place from a few other Yelpers, and made a point of coming here today for the first time.  I was on the lookout for a 3 quart saucepan, as mine is on the fritz.  Unfortunately, they didn't have one, so I got a candle while I was there.  I really liked it here for a few different reasons.  The selection is nice, and its gently used kitchen equipment.  All of thier stuff seems to be in really good shape.  They have a little bit of everything, from pots and pans, to bar stuff, some dishes, cookbooks, and other assorted kitchen items.  Even though I came up empty handed, I would gladly come here again.  Staff was friendly, selection was great and prices are fair.  This place is on my short list of consignment shopping stores!  O, beware, parking's a little tight here.

I love the Old Spaghetti Factory.  Growing up, I remember going to the one in Ohio on the way home from Cedar Point, and I always always always loved it.  I would go here in college as well, and I have so many fond memories here.  My friend Austin and I were hungry today, and wanted something different then the norm.  I suggested OSF and after googling it, realized that there was one right here at the Chandler Fashion Center.  this means I don't have to schlep all the way downtown anymore!  YES!  This particular location has only been open a year as of this month.  Place is huge, and decorated nicely!  Huge fluffy red chairs, chandeliers, large seating booths for big parties, and a big dining room in the front.  We were greeted by our server who took our order.  She was really good, and treated us great.  I went with the angel hair spaghetti, and my friend went with some other pasta dish that I can't remember.  We got bread sticks, drinks, and spumoni for dessert.  I would gladly come here again, as I always love dining here, as it brings back so many memories for me.  Keep up the good work OSF, I love you!

I came here for dinner today with a friend of mine, and I'm glad that I did.  What a great buffet!  The place was large, clean, and had a huge spread of food that seemed endless.  Price was fair for dinner, as it was $27 for the both of us.  I was really impressed with this one.  Some of the features that they have here are a Sushi station, a mongol ion BBQ area, plenty of desserts, and plenty of food for all to eat.  They also had quite the desert spread as well.  One of the better buffet's I've seen in town.  If your in the area, definitely go check this place out. Really worth it!

Yay, it finally opened!  I stopped in here today to grab some coffee and donuts, and they were both tasty.     I love dunkin donuts, and am glad that they have this location finally open, and its close to my place.  Great hours, free wifi, and tasty treats anda drinks for all.  I believe they have a drive thru here too!  Will be back in the future for more coffee, muffins and donuts!

I love a good sub, and since I was here today, I stopped into Jimmy John's to grab some lunch after a hard day of shopping, slacking off, sleeping and overall counter productivity.  I went with the #2 big john, and it was tasty as always.  Service was great, food is awesome.  The only downside to this place is that the inside is really not set up for dining in.  It's painfully small, with one tiny side counter that you can stand at to eat.  There is seating outside, but if the weather is uncooperative, you are seriously out of luck.  (like in July when its 115, or if it's raining, you'd kind of be hosed.)  Because of the seating here, I would say plan on taking it out.  I mean, if the weather is nice, and you can find a place to sit, (which normally is easy to do) then you are in luck. If it's hot, or extremely crowded, then you would be stuck walking around Tempe Market place looking for place to sit down.  Will be back in the future, as its always nice to have something different every now and then. Prices are fair, service is great, and its a great place to grab a quick bite.

I've heard loads about this place, and until recently, kept putting it off to come in.  So I finally made it in today, and really had a good time.  For starters, the menu is HUGE. Loads to choose from, and the prices are awesome!!  I wasn't sure what to get, so I asked the guy behind the counter, and he helped me out with what to pick.  I went with a carne asada burrito and a drink.  Price total?  $6.01.  YES!!!!  Food came out quick, and I was able to finish it all. Meat was good, and I got a plate of peppers, onions, salsa and a hot pepper.  The onions were good, but I wish they were already on the burrito!  The salsa was tasty and not to spicy, so I was able to enjoy it with my lunch.  Place is somewhat small and cramped, with limited but ample seating. Definitely not for an extremely large crowd, but enough to seat a few people.  The one thing I wish they did was have a fountain pop station, as I prefer that to cans or bottles of drinks.  I didn't see one, and the guy at the register told me it was cans or bottles of pop.  But yet, I saw a one couple who had Styrofoam cups. where did those come from? I  hate to sound so harsh, but I really think he needs a fountain pop station in here, seriously. I'll pay a little extra!  Parking is a bit tight and its in a non descript location.  If you didn't know it was there, you might just pass it!  Overall, a great experience, even though the carne asada was a bit dry for me. Not bad, just a tad dry for my tastes.  Overall, a wonderful experience, and I wouldn't mind going back.  Great food, lovely time.

I was at the bookstore today, and as I was pulling out, I realized that a Zoyo Yogurt had moved in across the street.  This is a dream come true for me, because I really love Zoyo.  Their unique, cute, and have a great little setup for a yogurt shop.    My first experience was with the one down in Chandler, off Chandler and 48th Street.  I came here tonight to treat myself, and went with the Cake Batter, with cherries and some chocolate syrup.  Grand total?  $3.07!!  Great prices, great flavors, toppings and a friendly staff, this place has it all.  Love you Zoyo!

I've been meaning to come back to this place for a while now after discovering it through a Yelp Elite event some time ago.  I finally had the time, so I jetted down to the restaurant and I had a really good time.  The service here was great.  I was greeted and seated immediately, and decided that lunch was the way to go for me.  I like the fact that they serve breakfast here until 2PM, because sometimes I DO want breakfast at noon!  They also have happy hour daily from 3-7 which is awesome as well.  No need to rush after work.  Just do happy hour on a Saturday!  Anyways, I went with the burger, and surprisingly, they have a variety of sides to choose from.  I "like" french fries, but am always looking for something more at times.  Sometimes I want a salad instead, or soup, and BLD gives you that choice.  Instead of fries, they have 4 or 5 choices to go with.  I went with hummus.  It was delicious!  Nice change of pace from fries.  Anyways, its a bit of a drive, but a nice alternative from the ordinary.  Lovely decor, spacey with lots of good food to choose from.   I will be back!

I came here last night with two of my friends for dinner and had a wonderful time.  The menu itself is outstanding, and the food was utterly delicious.  I went with the backyard burger, and it was delicious!  One of my other friends went with the New Orleans ribs and the other one went with the backyard burger like me.  The menu here seems to be pretty solid, and I've heard that there isn't a bad dish to get here, and I believe it.  The service was outstanding, and I really liked how attentive they were with us.  Since we were there during happy hour on the weekend, we all split a pitcher for $5, and it was tasty. I considered having a hard liquor drink, but I figured the beer would have been better.  Am I glad I did!  Definitely a Phoenix gem, and should be on everyone's short list of places to eat at when it town visiting!  Or, if you live here, go more often then I did! (which was never because I never really had the time.) I wish I had come here sooner.  Definitely a bit of a hipster place, but fun to not only people watch, but the food is awesome as well.  Don't get me wrong, there's regular people in here as well, but it's fun to see some of the hipsters stroll in and out from time to time.  Parking is easy since they put in the new lot immediately next door, and it's attached to an ice cream place as well.  the only draw back was the unisex bathrooms.  A line formed, and it's kind of a first come first serve deal. One toilet in each, and I don't know that I liked the idea.  The bathrooms were decorated really cool, so that kind of made it better for me. I just prefer separate bathrooms for men and women, that's all.  Also, I found the volume of the music in here severely annoying.  I thought it was a bit to loud, and felt like I had to talk over it at times.  Plus, the music sucked.  That's my only "real" annoyance, and it almost made me feel like I was in the club.  (ok, not close, I know, but nothing sucks more then having to talk over music!!)

The first time I tried Spinato's pizza was when my friend introduced me to it with carryout over the summer.  We went with the thin crust pizza and I really enjoyed it. The next time I was in town I stopped in and tried the restaurant itself, and really had a good time.  I don't know what this place was before, but I swear it used to be a Chili's. I could be wrong, but either way, its really well decorated.  Warm well decorated interior with a full bar and a great menu. Lots to choose from, and not just pizza (even though its their specialty.)  I really like the decor of this place. Not overstated, but classy enough that you can take your parents here and not have them freak out like mine do.  It feels like a great date spot too.  Service was great, and I really had a good time and the pizza and salad that I had were tasty.  I would come here again in a heartbeat. Check it out, worth the trip if you want something different and want to have a good time.

Last night I was in the mood for a burger, but wanted to try someplace different.  Did a search on yelp, and found that Two Hippies just opened a location here in my hood!  I've heard such good things about them from thier Phoenix location that I had to give them a try.  The place is small, but warmly decorated hippie style.  Family friendly, with plenty of games on the tables for adults and kids to play.  They have a nice menu of Breakfast items, Tacos, burgers and a few homemade desserts as well.  The gal at the counter was wonderful! So friendly and helpful.  She checked on me to make sure my food was good throughout the meal.  I went with a hamburger, fries and a drink.  They seem to have an awesome lemonade selection here, but I stuck with a Sprite myself.  I will be back in the future, as i was happy overall with the food and experience here.  Next time I will probably try the tacos.

I came here for breakfast this morning and it was absolutely delicious! I got two breakfast tacos with eggs, cheese potatos and chicken, each only being $2.  Service was awesome, food was delicious and I'm glad that I'm a fan of their breakfast now!  Will be back in no time flat.  Nothing beats a hot tasty breakfast on a Saturday morning with great friendly people.

So, I stopped in with a friend today after lunch because he had wanted to grab some spices for some dishes he was going to cook and I got to tag along.  I admit, I need to step up my cooking game a bit, and I think this place gave me some motivation to do so.  I had never heard of this place before, and when my friend had mentioned it, I admit, I was intrigued. A store just for spices? My brain lit up at this idea. Honestly,  I didn't know what to expect when I entered, but I can tell you, this is one heck of an interesting place.  Upon entering the place smelled like a spice store, but in a good way.  Clean, well organized with a huge selection of just about every spice possible.    Each bottle comes not only with the ingredients, but ideas on how to use it as well.  Some of the spices seemed unique to me, and I found it interesting to see what things can be used to spice up dishes.  The spices themselves come in a variety of sizes and ranging in prices.  I saw some that were just a few dollars for a small container, and over $40 for others.  The jars they sell them in are reuseable, so if you buy a jar of a certain spice, you can purchase the bag to reuse the same bottle. I like this idea. Plus, they also sell empty bottles in the corner of the store if you want to bottle your own spices if you should have a garden at home, or make a special concoction.  Overall, I was really impressed with this place.  Well organized, staff was friendly, prices were fair and there was an ample selection of items to choose from of all kinds. If your in the area, I would suggest checking this place out. Really cool, and you don't have to be a master chef to shop here.

This is a brand new IHOP that opened about a year ago to replace the older one that closed off Main and Dobson.   The place is bright, new and fun, with the same old IHOP menu that we all know and love.  I have been here a few times now and like it.  The new place really brings some life versus the old one off main that closed.  Service is great, and I got the pancakes with 2 eggs this morning.  Plenty of seating, parking is good, and not much of a wait for 9 AM on a Saturday.  Like every other place, the longer you wait to get in here, the longer your going to spend waiting for breakfast.  Obviously, most breakfast joints are packed on the weekends anyways, and IHOP is no different.  Food was tasty, service was great, and I will be back in the future for more!

I'm really torn on how to review this place.  I wanted to give it more stars, trust me.  But the more I think about it, the worst I feel.  I mean, this place isn't bad, I just left kind of feeling meh.  Here's why.  For starters, I will say I love the service I got here.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, upbeat and really nice.  That's the one thing I liked about this place. Other points, not so much.    The menu here is really limited.  You basically have 4 menu options to choose from. That's it.  No side items, build your own meal, nothing. I'm a girl that likes options, and sometimes I don't want a gigantic meal, just parts of it.  So I went with the smallest order I cound find, which was the 3 chicken strips, fries, drink and Texas toast for $5.99.  When the food came out and it wasn't half bad.  I felt like the toast could have been cooked a little longer, even though it was really yummy.  Fries could have been a little crispier, and the chicken wings were pretty good.  Overall, the food was good, and not bad, I just wasn't moved or overly impressed with it as a whole.  Plus, I don't think you can get different dipping sauces, even though their "secret sauce" was quite tasty. What I mean, was I didn't see an option for ranch or bbq sauce on the menu.  I wish they had more menu options here. I know you can only cook chicken so many ways, but it would be nice to see a salad, or a la carte type ordering, which they didn't have.  Service was great, and overall not a half bad experience.

I came here last night with John C to grab a bite to eat after he was telling me about this place.  It's a newer restaurant, and even though I've seen it a few times, finally stopped in here tonight.  The menu is huge, with a selection for everyone.  They have quite a few vegetarian dishes, along with meat, fish and chicken.  This place gets everything locally grown, and has mostly organtic, locally grown foods.  Place is well decorated and you seat yourself when you walk in.  John did most of the ordering.  I stuck with the falafel, and I really enjoyed it.  John ordered vegan spinach dip, hummus and veggie pizza.  Everything came out fine, but the veggie pizza had way to much broccoli on it.  I'm not a fan of broccoli, so I picked off the few pieces that we split between us.  The only downside was that the service here was a bit slow.  Took us a while to place our order, but overall, I will say that its probably because their new.  I would come back, but will probably try a few of their meat dishes next time I'm here.  They serve a lot of different dishes, so I can see myself trying a few different things upon returning!

I came here today because I was in the area, and figured it was time to try some Capriotti's. It was my first time eating their sandwiches, so I figured, what the heck, I'll give them a shot.  The menu has tons of options, and they have a few different sized subs, 9 inches being the smallest.  That's pretty darned big!  I went with a 9 inch Slaw Be Jo, and it came with meat, Russian dressing, coleslaw, mayo and roast beef.  The sandwich itself was okay, but I felt like it was missing something..it tasted kind of dry. I wanted to ask for more dressing, but after about getting half way through, I figured decided not to. I think the sandwich needs to come with some kind of dressing, prefereably Italian. It came across as somewhat dry.  Overall, prices were a okay.  $6.99 for the sandwich, $1.59 for drinks plus some tax, and the total was $9.35.  Not bad. I will say I wasn't impressed overall, but it wasn't the worst sandwich I had.  I feel like there's other sandwich shops in the area that serve similar but better sandwiches that might be worth trying before hitting up this place.

This has been my "go to" post office since I moved into my current apartment a few years ago.  Plenty of parking, a separate drive with 2 blue mail drop boxes, and a lobby full of post office boxes.  You have access 24 hours a day to the PO boxes, which is convenient   There's a second lobby behind glass doors, and that's the actually where the post office workers work, and where you would get your counter service for mailing stuff, stamps, etc.  The staff here isn't so bad, but its the post office, so don't expect to much.  There's a lady that usually waits on me, and she's rather nice.  I think there's also a gentleman who works on the counter, and he's a bit more gruff, but gets you what you need.  Back in 2011, my mailbox was broken, and it took my apartment complex 6 months to fix.  Every Saturday morning I came in here to get my mail from the counter staff, and overall, it was okay.  Some days were good, other days were not.  The later you go in on a Saturday, the longer the line.  Your better off getting there first thing to avoid the crowds.  Most likely, your going to have some kind of wait.  Staff was friendly and decent most of the time, and the wait varied depending on a number of factors.  Some Saturdays I was the only one in line, others, the line felt like it was a mile long.  98% of the time, there's only been 2 counter staff working. Its the govt...and the post office did layoffs, so thats most likely why its a line some times.  Overall, I'm reasonably satisfied with my experiences here.  I still use the drop boxes outside often and frequently to mail stuff out, and its great to live close to a place like this.  As annoying as the post office is at times, I like being able to save a day on mailing and take my stuff right here.

Ok, so I'm slowly becoming a gardener.  Over the past year or so, I've learned quite a few things, killed a few plants, and really learned a bit about growing stuff in Arizona.  When I moved into this apartment, I wanted a nice garden with some plants on the patio because I actually have the space.  Plus, being on the ground floor it adds to the privacy of people seeing in my apartment.   This nursery isn't huge, but its plentiful on its stock.  The items that I have purchased from here have been hardy, lived through an Arizona summer and are big as can be.  Prices are fair, and most have lived. If they haven't lived, its probably because I killed them, or the heat did them in.  Prices are great, and let me tell you, they have a little bit of everything here!  They also have an email program that you can sign up for at the register and you get regular emails about sales, classes and other things going on at the nursery on a semi regular basis.  You also earn points when purchasing things here that can go towards discounts when you hit a certain amount. I like that! Frequent shopper points!  The only thing that makes me dock them a star is the service.  The first two times I went here, the same lady waited on me, and she was kind of rude and gave me misinformation.  She would totally blow me off, ignore me, wait on other people even though she said she'd be back in a moment and treat me like a complete idiot. If I was to have reviewed this location on her alone, I would have given this store negative stars.    Since then, I really haven't seen the lady, and the service has been fine overall. Everyone else seems to know what they are doing, give good information and are friendly.  Prices are great, place is well stocked and there's a little bit of something for everyone here.

So a friend and I decided to take a beginners glass blowing class here after finding a deal on Living Social.  It was part of their fall beginners class, and we got to make pumpkins last night, and I have to say, it was a lot of fun.  The place itself is kind of hidden in a residential part of town, and if you didn't know it was there, you would totally miss it like I did last night when going to class.  The studio itself is set back, and I have to say, it was really a lot of fun. The two guys who ran the class taught us a lot about what's involved with glass blowing, and were pretty funny the whole night through.  did you know that they keep the glass ovens between like 2100 and 2400 degrees? Did you know it takes 10 days for the kiln to cool down from those temperatures, and 10 days to warm back up?  I found the information interesting, and felt like I learned a lot last night during class.  The process itself was pretty fun and went really fast.  There's a variety of steps you go through to get the glass to shape and make its colors, and it was a whole lot of fun.  I wish it was something I could do more often, like drop in and make a few things, but unfortunately, that would be expensive on my end!  Let me tell you, the ovens themselves didn't make me nervous at all, but dang, those things are BRIGHT AS HECK AND HOT TOO.  They have you wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the light itself when your cooking the glass.  The guys here are fun, and the younger one with black hair was really cute too! They are really nice and friendly, so feel free to ask them as many questions as you want!  I will be back at some point, and will keep my eyes open for more living social deals!

I've been coming to this gas station for a while now, and I have to say, its A okay.  It was recently remodeled back about a year and a half ago, so its new and clean!  They added a car wash here which is great.  Gas prices are lower then the rest here, store is clean and well stocked, and the staff here are warm and friendly.  I think their open 24 hours and all holidays, which is great.    The only downside (as with most AM/PM's) is that they don't take credit cards here.  They take cash, and debit cards for a 45 cent surcharge, but no major credit cards.  I love coming here because its close to home, gas is a few cents cheaper, and its not insanely busy like the QT so getting in and out is easy.  Stop in here for whatever you may need...gas, carwash, coffee, etc.  Plus, its in a little shopping plaza, so you can come in to hang out for a bit.

I've heard lots of good things about this place, and since I was in the area today I thought I would swing in and grab a bite to see what all the hoopla was about.    The menu itself is ample with a variety of selection, but I swear I waited half a lifetime to place my order.  I was hungry and we were the only one's standing there, so I'm not sure what the holdup was, but I started getting ansy.  Eventually a lady took our order and we sat and waited while our food was prepped.  I went with the 3 chicken strips, fries and a drink combo platter and my friend went with the wing plate himself.  Overall the food was good, but I was a little irritated with the long wait.    Also, part two of my experience was a combination of the crabby lady behind the counter who took our order and the bathroom situation. They kind of go hand in hand.  For starters, she was kind of rude and cold to me.  I wasn't sure why, but it got worse as the lunch went on.    my breaking point with her was when I tried to use the ladies room only to realize they were out of toilet paper. I came out to the counter to mention it to her, and I basically got completely blown off.  For starters, the guy mixing wings behind the counter totally ignored me when I started talking.  Then, the rude lady heard me, poked her head out from the back, saw me, and went back behind the wall to finish her conversation on her I phone. I couldn't wait any longer so I went into the men's room since apparently whatever I had needed was of no importance to her.  After I was done, I came back around to the counter and she was done talking on her cell phone. I told her she was out of toilet paper in the ladies room, and she screamed over her shoulder to some guy to go take care of it.  I can deal with a wait for the food, but the crabby lady just makes me think twice about coming back here, along with no toilet paper in the bathroom as well.  The food is okay, but I just don't know about doing a drive down here again for this place.....

I've had this on my list of places to try for a while now, and since I'm in this part of town for the next few days, I wanted to stop and try it out.  I came here for lunch today, and had a really good time.  Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.  I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.  I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to "hurry up" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.  I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.  They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.  Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that.   Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!  Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!

Ok, I'm a Fry's girl, I admit, but Safeway's got it going on.  This location is pretty darn cool with tons of food and awesome displays.  It's also convieniently located in the foothills, which is even better.  I like this location because it's a really nice clean location.  Plenty of produce, it has a hot food counter, a deli and ton's more.  The staff here is friendly for the most part, and my shopping experience was easy when I was here.  No long lines, friendly service and I was able to find everything I needed.  Overall a very pleasant experience!

Since I last visited this place, my experiences have improved tremendously.  I go here for all of my service needs on my Sentra, and its been absolutely awesome.  The salesman that I initally had a bad experience with I do not think works there any more, and the guys that Ive talked to since have been really nice and helpful.  As I said earlier, I primarily go here for my service, and all the guys in there are helpful, fun and seem to know thier stuff.  My experience here has greatly improved, and will continue to come here for all of my needs with my nissan for as long as I have the car.

I was driving down Glendale, spotted this place and thought I had to go in and check it out.  It's a cute little consignment store with a variety of women's clothing and shoes.  They have a variety of sizes, and a cute selection at that.      Although the store doesn't have a humungous selection of clothing, its quality and in good shape.  They have large ample dressing rooms, and even though I didn't purchase anything today, I really like this place. It smelled really good, the lady who helped me was really nice, and overall I had a good experience here.  Go check it out, I think you'll like it as much as I did!

I wanted some good deli and decided to come here with a friend for some Sunday afternoon food, and let me tell you, this place is worth it's weight in gold.  When I walked in, the place had plenty of seating, and had some nice décor. I loved how there was plenty of seats in the waiting area, so if it got busy, you didn't have to stand around or anything.  The menu has a good selection of food, with all the good Jewish Deli fixings. I wanted to start off with some Gefilte fish, but the server came back and told me that they were all out? How do you run out of Gefilte fish?!?  I went with the chopped liver instead, and that was really tasty! It didn't look like a lot, but let me tell you, my friend and I split it and it was enough for the two of us. It came with cucumbers, tomatoes, rye bread and some hard boiled eggs.  Ugh, so delicious!  I went with the brisket sandwich on Challah, and it was super tasty! Challah was fresh, brisket was wonderfully done, and even the coleslaw was good. My friend went with a full sandwich and it was HUGE!  It was like whoa, that's like 3 meals worth of food! I could barely finish my half sandwich, so unless your splitting it, I would say go with half!  Overall the experience was great.  I really recommend coming here as it's worth the trip and the food is quite tasty.

I'm a huge fan of Potbelly subs.  The first time I ever ate at one was in Chicago many years ago, and I fell in love with them right then and there. Eventually, they opened a few in Michigan, and I would eat there when I could.    Fast forward a few years, and now I live in Phoenix. Not a potbelly in sight, so I ate at other sub shops. Now don't get me wrong, Phoenix does have a good selection of sub places to eat at, and I am a fan of a few local places out here. But, when I heard that they were opening a Potbellies, I could not have been any more excited! FINALLY!  So this place opened last week, and the foot traffic in and out of this place has been tremendous!  Move over other sub shops, this place is here to stay. Potbelly's makes a hell of a sub, and I, along with many others, are dedicated fans of this place. I went on the second day they opened, and got me a roast beef sub. Today? I got the stack without the ham.  Potbelly's has a great menu selection to choose from, with extremely wonderful prices.  They also list the calorie count for you right on the menu, so you know just how healthy (or unhealthy) the sub will be.  They even have a vegetarian sub for all you non meat eaters! Also they have great deserts here, all fresh baked. Cookies and brownies freshly made, along with smoothies and shakes as well.  These are some serious people here folks!  The menu here is ample, with plenty to choose from, but it's not as big as I remember it from the Chicago and Detroit locations.  The gal told me that they have a limited menu now since they just opened, and will be adding on in the future with the rest of the items that they normally offer.  Service here is surprisingly efficient, with plenty of staff to help you out. The line may be long, but it moves quickly, so don't be intimidated when you arrive.  I'm in and out in 5 minutes!  They have plenty of seating indoors and out, but if you come during lunch hour like I do, you might have a problem finding a seat. Since I work right here, I just take the sub back with me to my desk and eat.  Go eat some Potbellies. Best subs around, and you'll be a fan of this place in no time!

I'm always on the hunt for nice clothing, especially since I've been doing a lot of interviews for new jobs. I heard about this place on the news last week, and bookmarked it on yelp to check out.  Granted, it's not close to my home, but I thought, hey, it's worth checking out.  I came here today and boy, did, I have fun. I tried on a few outfits and was happy with what I saw.  They have a nice selection of name brand stuff that's really in good shape and nice prices! Most stuff I saw was between $8-10, and was name brand like Chicos', liz clayborne, Ann Taylor and much much more.  They also have tons of clothes in ALL sizes, including mine! I'm not fat, but sometimes I find that stuff in XL isn't always carried at consignment stores (who shall remained unnamed).  The store is large, well laid out and the staff is really friendly here.  I think their closed on Sunday's and Monday's, so make sure you get here when their open!  I really liked it here, and will probably be back in the future.

I've eaten here about three times now, and I have to say I'm a fan. I've eaten at their location in Gilbert several times before, so I knew what to expect when walking in.  The place is colorfully decorated, with different colored tables and chairs of all sizes for seating.  Their food is cooked fresh, they will make what you want to order on or off the menu.  I usually go with the shredded beef taco with some kind of beans and rice.  This is a hearty meal, and let me tell you, its filling and delicious. I love their shredded beef, as its really moist and juicy. Their tortilla's are made fresh by hand, and you can watch them  make it as your standing in line.  Overall I love this place, but at times, I feel rushed through line. I also have a hard time hearing the guys behind the counter when they ask me stuff like what I want on my taco.  Honestly, I know my hearing is good, so I think its the noise from behind the counter that drowns them out.  I have to ask them a lot to repeat themselves, and its not that they aren't loud enough....but in between the glass that's separating you and the noise from the kitchen, I have to keep saying "HUH? ONE MORE TIME PLEASE."  Also, sometimes i feel rushed at the register when i pay. I take my time and put my money back in my wallet and make sure I have everything before I take my tray, and sometimes I feel like they want me to hurry up so they can keep the line down, and not have it pile up.  (I know, fussy, right?)  LOL  Overall, I love their food here and I really enjoy eating here. I plan on coming back in the future to eat more, and even though its on the pricier size, I'm definitely a fan!

This, by far, is the nicest, biggest, cleanest Goodwill I have ever been too.  I was on the way home from a friend's house today, and stopped here before getting on the expressway.  This is one of the locations that I have not been to before, despite me being very familiar with the area.   When I walked in, I was blown away! HUGE SELECTION OF STUFF! OMG!  Everything here is so organized, and they have a TON of stuff to choose from! (I've been to a few very sad neglected Goodwill's in my day...THIS is not one of them!)  I searched through a bunch of clothes, shoes and other stuff while I was here. I didn't buy anything on this visit, but I will be back. Place is awesome, well organized and in really good shape. If you want a really nice goodwill with tons of stuff to choose from, go here! Best store ever!

I recently heard about the opening of Tanger Outlets, and wanted to go check it out.  Being that it's the holiday season, I figured the sooner I checked this place out, the better off I would be in knowing what their stores are like and trying to avoid the huge crowds.  Tanger has tons of great shops that have moved in here, and I was really impressed with the selection.  Polo, Coach, White House Black Market, and a ton of other shops, the selection is impressive.  Parking is ample, and there's a great variety of things to do here.  My only complaint about the place is there's no food area here. Nothing.  Not even a starbucks! I think I saw a Wendzel's pretzels, no food options! I was starving when I was done walking around here, and figured that there had to be something to eat or drink while I was here. Not a thing!  There was a hot dog cart and a chicken truck, but no food!  I ended up going across the street to Westgate to eat instead, but hopefully they get a food place or two in here like a starbucks or something. Aside from that, this place is pretty cool, and I will probably be back in the future.

Last night, my friend was telling me about this new BBQ place and that he had wanted to try it.  I had never heard of it before, and thought it sounded like a good idea.  After checking out their website, I thought, why the heck not?  So, I shuffle down to this side of town, looking forward to a new BBQ place.  I had read several of the reviews before i left and went in with an open mind not really knowing what to expect.  Well, lets say its not what I had hoped it would be.  At first glance, the menu seemed decent enough, but as I spent time going through it, I realized they didn't have a lot of what I had expected for a BBQ place.  I guess this place is a popular stop at the AZ fair, at least according to their website and pamphlet at the restaurant.  When you walk in, the place is colorfully decorated, with plenty of seating, and lots of fair themed stuff.  Their really hip on promoting themselves as an AZ state fair vendor, and that's okay.  The decor reflects this.  Pretty cool, and probably the only thing that really left a halfway decent impression on me. (colorful decorations, lots of fair ride chairs throughout the place, decorated napkin holders with AZ state fair pictures on them, etc.)  After I went through their menu, I realized it was half American food and half BBQ.  Well, half burgers and have BBQ really.  I had questions about their BBQ, and was kinda dissapointed with the selection.  NO shredded beef or chicken, and no Brisket.  Just BBQ'd beef cut into slices and chicken parts.  Um, why can't I get shredded beef or chicken? Isn't that sorta standard fair for places like this?  So, we ordered our food at the counter and for 2 adults, it cost $34.06! HOLY CRAP THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.  I got the BBQ beef sandwich with a baked potato side, with a drink.  My friend went with the cheese fries, a sandwich and a drink.  It just seemed outrageously priced, and we were both shocked at the price point. If I wanted to spend $35 on dinner, I can think of a million different places to go besides here, and get a nicer meal with a waiter and a cool, fun atmosphere!   So, we go sit down for our food, and we wait.  and wait.  and we wait some more.  Finally, after an extended period of time, my drink ran out and we were starting to think they forgot about our order.  My drink was running low, so I figured I would go refill it and check on the status of our order.  Mind you, there was a soda fountain to the hard right of the entrance.  I went there and realized they only had half the selection of drinks that the order counter did.  so, I schelp to the register, get my drink refilll and ask about my order.  They said it was the next ticket up and it would be a few more minutes. ok, so I sat back down.  I got back to my table and they brought out our food.  It was okay, but not $35 dollars awesome.  The beef was okay, and the potato was awesome, but the place is laid out really weird.  I couldn't find any silver ware, but my friend found it and he grabbed us both forks and such.  They also had a burger bar area, with napkins, straws, salad dressings, lettuce and all the burger toppings you would need.  (I think this is where he found the forks, but both of us missed the forks and had to ask where they were.  They were in a dispenser off to the side that neither one of us saw the first time we went to the counter.  Overall, I wasn't impressed.  Primarily over the really high price point here, and the fact that the food was just okay.I mean, the food wasn't bad at all, but after having some sticker shock at the bill, it kind of overshadowed the goodness of what we ate.  I've eaten at other burger and BBQ places, spent half the amount, and had WAY better food across the board.    Overall, neither one of us plan on going back. I will say the service was awesome, and I wish more service was like this, but overall, the whole experience left us disappointed and I don't think we will be back any time soon.

Sue and I came here to catch up and grab a bite to eat while I'm in town.  It's a bike themed ale place, and I really liked it. I don't know what it was before, but I wish this place was here when I lived in Mesa.  They have a gorgeous patio with tons of covered seating.  Sue and I sat outside before they opened and hung out for a bit. Once they opened, we went in and placed our order.  I went with the chicken strips and sweet potato fries while she went with clam chowder soup.  Our server was really nice and paid good attention to our table with our order.  We didn't feel rushed at all. Unfortunately, I was unable to try any of the beer since it was to early for me to start drinking.  From what I could tell, they had a decent enough selection and I liked that.  Place was open and airy with plenty of seating and a nice relaxed feel to it.  Overall this place is a good little spot.  Great menu, friendly staff and overall good location. Please give it a try if your on this side of town.

This Dunkin Donuts just opened a few weeks ago, and man, what a nice addition this has been? Their move in here is great, because it's finally nice to have some coffee, donuts and bagels in this complex for once.  The place itself is located at the end of the strip mall, visible from the road.  There's a walk up window, with outside seating, and plenty of space inside.  It's a nice sized suite, with a full Dunkin Donuts menu. Bagels, donuts, muffins, coffee and a few sandwiches as well.  My coworkers and I have eaten here a few times, and we love it!  Awesome coffee which keeps us coming back, along with all the tasty pastries.  Service here is great, and the gals are friendly.  Will be back in the future for more awesome tasting coffee and muffins!

I finally made it out here today and I absolutely loved it.  The place was packed!!  O my goodness loads of people!!  The place is huge, with an enormous amount of signage and colorful décor.  Ton's of tables, and lots of people helping.  The lines here were long, but I didn't spend more then 15 minutes between the time I stood in line and got my food.  they have two lines here. One for ordering, one for food pickup.  They had all 4 registers open, with girls throughout the line taking your order and writing it down for you to make things go quicker.  Once I got to the register, things went fine.  They sent me over to the pickup line where you grab your drinks and food.  That was the longer line of the two, and you kind of stand around in this clustered area waiting for your number to be called.  Being that this place was packed, there was an enormous amount of people waiting, but it seemed to go by quickly.  I found a seat near the door, and the food was awesome!  I got the jumbo hot dog with relish, mustard and onions with a pickle on the side. Bun was tasty, and I loved it. Price point was right on, and I will gladly drive the few extra miles to go here in the future.  If you haven't gone to Portillo's, you must do so!! Tasty!!  They also have a drive thru here, so if you want to avoid the crowds, or are in a hurry, this is the way to go.  Outdoor seating is available, along with ample parking in a very busy shopping center. Place is visible from the road, but come early because the place is non stop busy!!

I've been coming to the Arabian Horse show for a long time now, and let me tell you, this is by far the coolest thing going on in Arizona in the middle of February that you just cannot miss!  2400 Arabian and half horses competing for 10 days is no small feat, let me tell you.  This show has been at Westworld for a long time now, long before I ever discovered this event. There's 11 arenas of competition going on, from Western Pleasure, reining, saddle seat and a whole lot more.  Just about every possible competition goes on here for horses and riders, and the best of the best will show here.  The riders do end up winning cash prizes and its a national show, so the awards really mean a lot to the  barns and riders competing.  Overall, there's 11 rings of competition going on for 10 days all day long. Competition starts at 8 am and generally runs until 6 PM.  As long as your there during these hours, you can watch any of the competitions you like.  You walk from arena to arena and watch the riders do their thing, and they announce the winners right then and there.  They also have warm up rings so you can watch the trainers and riders warm up for those competitions that are coming up, and its an awesome sight to see.  They also have an enormous amount of shopping here.  Everything from Jewelry, to clothes, paintings, furniture, horse and animal products such as saddles, harnesses, natural dog products and beds and a bunch more.  Lots of barn companies show up here as well for people who want to have one on their property! This is awesome to walk through and see!  They have really cute affordable ones that are 4 stalls big, that can house up to 4 horses, or you can make one a tack room and put 3 other horses in there at your preference.  They even have super expensive ones (the ones that I love and want) that are made of really fancy wood and have all kinds of awesome features in them. Some of these barns are as expensive as a house! Definitely a must see!  Some of the features are so cool I can't believe it!    They have lots and lots of food here to eat as well with a lot of vendors to choose from.  Things like ice cream, lemonade and coffee from some of the small vendors who drive in to sell at the event, along with larger more well known local and national resturants who set up booths here to serve food of all kinds at the show.  I usually eat before the show, but you can find just about anything to eat here that a person can think of.  BBQ stands, chicken, veggie stuff, you name it, they sell it.  Another thing they do here is barn tours twice a day, where you can meet and play with the horses that compete. They also auction some of the horses on site, so you can watch some of them get bid on in front of the barns, and it's an awesome experience to watch.  Stud fees of $2000, and I've seen a few middle eastern men from Dubai spend 6 figures on these baby horses with fantastic blood lines to add to their horse collection.  Oh, and don't think the auction is for the weak of heart.  Plan on watching people spend several thousand dollars on these horses.  I saw a horse that was up for sale at a barn for $25,000. um, yea. I've heard of people spending 6 figures before because of bloodlines and rarity.   If you haven't been, please go check it out. The show runs for 10 days every February and its totally a great way to spend an afternoon or two in the sun out here.  You don't have to ride horses (like I do) to appreciate what goes on.

This is the new and improved IHOP that just opened after the new year due to the light rail construction.  They built this place from the ground up, and it looks fabulous inside and out.  IHOP seems to be doing a lot in regards to upgrading its properties, as this is not the first time I've seen a brand spanking new IHOP here in the valley over the past 2-3 years.  I came here early on a Saturday morning and was seated right away.  Place is new and clean, and the staff was really nice and friendly.  I went with the chocolate chip pancakes, hash browns and bottomless coffee.  My bill was $11.77 after tax, and I really enjoyed myself. I got 4 pancakes, but I should have gone with 2! I couldn't finish them all!  I paid my bill and left before the food coma set in.  The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was for two reasons.  First, when I got seated, my table didn't have any silverware. I didn't realize this until I got my coffee and went to stir in the cream and sugar.  I looked around and realized that non of the tables in my section had any silverware either!  (the section was empty except for me).  I finally spotted a set of silverware a few tables down, and grabbed that so I could use the spoon to stir.    Secondly, I had my computer with me, and the girls at the front gave the password to get online.  I put it into my computer and the internet said "limited connectivity." I was somewhat flustered with this as I did have a few things online that I wanted to address while I was eating my breakfast.  I tried a few times during my stay and was never able to get online.    While I was eating my breakfast, a family of 6 sat down from me. He tried to get online with his smartphone and was unable to connect as well. He had the same problem I did. The password was good, but he couldn't bring up the internet.   I don't know why they don't just have a password free environment. I imagine this would cause more stress for the servers trying to help people get online, and it's really annoying since they aren't IT people. It seems like they have some sort of problem going on with their internet, and no on there could get on.  They need to A) drop the pass word stuff, but more importantly B) figure out why the internet isn't working in the restaurant for customers.  It's frustrating!  Also, the servers do a good job and its not fair to them to stand there and try to play IT while people are also eating there food.  Overall, I had a good experience, and the few things that were aggravating were small and can be worked out.  Will be back in the future for more good breakfast!

I LOVE Filiberto's!  Being that I'm a fan, I've eaten at this location before, just not for a while. I like that this one's a sit down location, as normally I go to the one's that are the walk up/drive through ones.  I ate with my friend here for dinner tonight and we both enjoyed ourselves.  I went with my usual of the two shredded tacos, dirty rice and refried beans.  Friend went with the Carne Asada fries.  Both were delicious!  Mine was a bit greasier then normal, but still was exactly what I needed.  The place was kind of dead when we were there, but it was still good none the less.  They also have a salsa bar here, which is kind of cool.  Service was okay, and the food came out hot and quick.  The only down side to this place is that the floor was super sticky in spots and could have used a good moping. I also noticed one of the booths had a tear in the vinyl seating, and hopefully it gets repaired soon. I know this place is "just a Filly B's" but who wants to see it go into slum status?  Anyways, even though the food was extra greasy last night, it's still my favorite food to secretly eat even though it's horrible for me!

So, I bought a living social coupon back a few months ago for 30 days of unlimited boxing lessons at this gym.  I've wanted to try boxing for a while, and I finally found a deal to try it out.  Overall, I liked this gym. It's strictly boxing, with a ring in the center of the gym.  They have quite a few full size punching bags of different sizes, a padded floor and separate bathrooms.  The trainer that trained me was great, really nice, and worked me out doing a bunch of different exercises.  They have evening classes here, box fit and MMA style fighting, both in the evening.  Classes seemed to be small in size, and if your a member of this gym, you can come and work out alone, with a trainer or in a class.  The floor is padded, and they have a few extra workout things to help you in your training. Such things as weights, bars, mats and other things as well.  Most of my workout was quite intense, at least for me since I'm out of shape. I did a lot of leg excercises, learned how to stand properly, punch and basically learn the basics of boxing.  Overall I'm really happy with my experience. The reason I docked a star, is because their parking here stinks!  They are located within a small strip mall, and I had to park around the block on a street in a residential area. Parking is really painfully limited, and that was kind of annoying. I know they don't have much room here, but having to park in front of someone's house made me nervous...I was afraid that they were going to tow my car or something!  They have limited parking out front, but more then likely you will probably have to park on the side street!  Overall I'm happy here, and will continue on with my lessons until my coupon expires.  Give them a shot if your serious about getting in shape!

As a native Detroiter, I grew up on Coney Islands, as their a staple.  Most people have a favorite one, and when I left Detroit, I found that Phoenix doesn't really have any Coney Islands.  When a friend told about this place and how it just opened, I KNEW I had to go try it, and today I did just that.  Upon entering, the place is in a tired little strip mall, but inside its the closest thing I can get to a Detroit Coney.  The menu is large and ample, with lots of Detroit goodies, such as a coney dog with all the fixings (chili, onions, etc.) Gyros, greek salads, fries and a whole bunch of other items that are made as they should be. I liked the fact that the menu spanned the entire back wall and was on huge flat screen TV's.  They also have some Detroit memorabilia on the walls of old car stuff which was really cute, and the interior was simply decorated with an open window to the grill so you could see the cook making your food as the girl took the order.  Overall the food was good. I went with the Gyro and fries with a coke, and it came out tasty!  it was a bit garlicly, but in a good way.  I had also wanted to get a greek salad, but I knew there was no way I could eat all that food in one sitting, so I passed. I still have to try the coney dogs, as they have a few options here (Chicago, Detroit and Phoenix style dogs) but I think I will get that next time I go.  They had a steady stream of people coming in and out on a Sunday afternoon, and the girl behind the counter was busy as all get out.   The only thing that suffered was I got my food a good 5 minutes before my friend did, so bad timing on her part. I hate when that happens!  My friend didn't mind and neither did I, but I could have waited to eat (which I did) and that was probably the only thing with the meal that didn't go right. Every thing else was awesome!  If your from Detroit, back east, or just want some seriously good coney food, come here. Its like a little slice of home.  Local business support as well, and worth a trip for those of you who like this kind of stuff. Enough of a menu selection and a good price point to keep everyone happy and guarantee that you'll walk out with a full stomach like I did!  They also have a rockin breakfast menu as well!

I drove by this place the other day on the way back to my friends house and decided that I had to try this place out.  I've heard of it before, but never eaten here, so I thought I would give it a try.    My friends and I came in on Saturday night and grabbed dinner.  There were four of us total and we were seated right away.  The place is decorated like a movie theatre, which I really liked. Place is spacious with plenty of seating. Two of my friends split a pizza with drinks, while I went with half a steak and cheese sandwich with chips.  Other friend went with a calzone and drinks as well.  The food came out and we all seemed to like it. Service was awesome, and the waitress was really attentive, which we liked.  Our drinks were always full, food was served promptly, and the menu had a great selection of items to choose from.  I got enough chips, but I felt like I got the bottom of the bag as most were smashed under the big ones.  I ended up not getting a drink myself, but they have a great beer selection from what I noticed.  I found the drink prices to be a bit high, but not outrageous.  $7 for a beer and about $10 for mixed drinks.  I don't know if they have happy hour or not, but I would probably go if they did.  I tried one of my friends beers, and it was tasty.  Overall, we had a really good time here. I don't think it's the best food I've ever had, but I enjoyed my time and would return in the future for more.

I needed to get stuff done this morning and wasn't being very productive at my friends place, so I grabbed my computer and strolled out here.  I drove by this place the first day I was here and was like "oh thank goodness it's not a Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts!"  Don't get me wrong, those two places serve their purpose, but can be cramped and busy at times.  I like to try to hit up small independent places like this when I can, and was more then happy to come in here today.  When I arrived, I loved how the place was set up.  Very cozy with ample seating.  Tables and couches lined the side of the shop with the coffee counter in the same spot it's always been.  There wasn't anyone there, so I was able to place my order at the counter right away.  The guy who helped me was really cute, and after asking a few questions and chit chatting, I placed my order for a hot mocha.  It came out in a really cute cup with a saucer, and had tons of whipped cream.  Yay whipped cream! I did some internet surfing and made some calls back home and was able to get through my stuff in no time without being interrupted.  Prices here don't seem to be cheap, and I would say in general, their along the lines of Starbucks. BUT, the difference is I feel like I'm supporting the small coffee business!  Overall, I really enjoyed my time here.  By the way, you have to have a code to get on the internet, and it requires a purchase.  The guy at the counter will print a password out for you. I don't know if there's a time limit, but no free internet surfing here!  Just an FYI!

I've been going to the Tempe location for years, and was happy to hear that they were opening a location downtown before I left.  I'm a huge fan of these guys, as it's the only brick and mortar book store that I will shop at.  I have really high expectations for this place, and was torn about how to review it.  I mean, the place is awesome. It's and outstanding place any way you cut it, but there were a few things that I noticed when I came in here for the first time yesterday.  For starters, the positives.  It's beautiful inside and out. I love how it looks from the street, and walking inside is really inspiring and makes me want to buy everything in there.  Place is clean, well stocked, and they have a really cool wine bar area that you can sit at with chairs and tables in the back for larger parties of 4 or so.  You can grab a book, a drink with a muffin and sit down and get lost in the moment.  The downsides:  I did not see a single cushy chair our couch.  All straight back chairs, nothing more.  Why is that?  Also, they have a very limited selection of used books here.  Mostly new with some sale items as well.  They also have the usual candles and knick knacks and such, but after I cruised, I realized this.  Back in the day at the Tempe location, it seemed to be about 50/50 selection on any given day.  I never had a problem finding a used book for under $10 to read.  Now, I feel like it's mostly new books at full retail, with a limited used selection.  If I'm going to get stuck paying full retail, I may as well buy it on Amazon, which I try to avoid doing. I WANT to shop here. I WANT TO SPEND MY MONEY AT YOUR STORE.  Also, you cannot trade books here, only at the tempe location. I am fine with this and have no issues, but would put it out there in case people are wondering.  I'm still a huge fan of this place and love it dearly.  I've just seen these subtle changes over the years, and it's at the point where I can no longer ignore it.  Congrats Changing hands for opening this location.  If I still lived in AZ I would probably shop here more often and hang out.

I've eaten at the Scottsdale Portillo's, but since I've been away, they opened this second location in the Tempe area in the mall area.  Since I'm a fan of a good hot dog, I came here to eat with a friend for lunch and to hang out. I'm glad I did!  The menu has a bunch of stuff to choose from, but I went with my usual, of two Vienna beef hot dogs with mustard and onions with a drink. My friend went with the same order as well.  Fortunately, there wasn't to much of a line, but as we sat and chatted for a while, we noticed that crowds came and went in spurts.  I love how the place is decorated. Lots to look at with cool lights and the such.  Our food only took about 10 minutes or so to come out and it was delicious.  It was hard to hear the girl call our order but we got it the second time she called our order number out.    Staff here is pretty friendly and cool and things seem to move along quickly. Plenty of places to sit with all the fixings at the condiment counter you can think of.  The only downside is that the fountain drinks are located behind the order pick up counter. I don't know why they do this.  It would be nice to have one located for self service, since refills are free anyways.  I had to get more Sprite and I felt like I was bothering the girl since the counter was slamming busy when I went back up to get more pop.  It would make it easier on the staff if patrons could refill their own drinks.  Overall the food was good here, and I do like eating here when I'm in town. The buns are tasty and make the dogs good.  If was I was still in town I would probably try more menu items, but I wanted to keep it simple since I was starving and was craving their beef dogs.  Overall not half bad.  Cool place and I love eating here.  They also have a HUGE Patio to eat outside at with shade overhead so you don't get hit by the sun.

I came here on Saturday becuase I had to get my Jeep serviced, and I wanted to check this dealership out.  I made an appointment, and dropped my Jeep off in the sevice bay.  I was greeted when I walked into the dealer, and I had a decent experience here.  I DO have to say, that I didnt like waiting 3 hours, but that seems to be at most any dealership you go to for warranty work, so I cannot blame them for that.  What I DON'T like is going for service and tying to be "sold" on a new vehicle. Im in for service, not to buy or trade in my car.  Why do the salesman do that?  I know its thier job to sell, but not every single time.  Geez.  Annoying.
