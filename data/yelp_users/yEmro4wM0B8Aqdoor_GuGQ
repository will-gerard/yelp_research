This was the place my girlfriend and I went for our first date 4 years ago. Been hooked ever since. If you don't go I will not be offended it just means I don't have to wait as long. Really it is a great place for wine and light food.

They live to preach their family care on every sign in the hospital but if your kid is in the ER, be prepared to have one of the parents sit in the lobby for hours texting other to know what's going on. Avoid this hospital if you can.

Huston's is a staple in town. Always great food and they are very consistent. You know exactly what you are getting every time. This restaurant has more of a corporate feel than most and is not cheap. That said the food is always top quality. Love it and will go back. Totally worth trying if you are in the area or have never been here.

Doctor Rouhani is awesome. I am super happy with the services and the results. He truly cares about you and the work he puts in. I had an issue he could not for see and he spent a ton of time to make sure I was completely happy. I highly recommend smile concepts.

When pulling up to this restaurant I had a great feeling. Such a pretty setting.... And that was the best thing I experienced here. The staff was rude and the food was not worth the price. It started with the host telling us that the patio was closed, even though we called at 3:30 earlier to verify we could have patio seating at 7:30. Did I mention that it is march in Phoenix and 75 degrees. Reluctantly, we were sat on the patio but the server made sure we paid for his inconvenience. He had to open an extra door. Every question or request was met with a snappy comment. We end up asking for a new server and the manager was mildly sympathetic. We would have left right away if we were not with other dinner guests and very hungry. They brought one of our guests the wrong meal and the food was good but not great. Over priced in my opinion. That being said the discounted our $300.00 bill by $75. I don't plan to go back anytime soon. If you choose to go here, good luck.

Four peak's is an awesome restaurant. I can not say enough about the place. I have been to all of the locations at least 100+ times. The food is clearly, designed with care and the beer is always great. Being a long time fan, I had to read the negative reviews and I can see some merit to what is being said. These are the reasons I removed one star. Sometimes you get an ditzy hostess or server that makes you feel not very important but it is rare and management watches closely. I have also had a flawed meal here and there. I think the food costs were getting cut and the cooks were getting lazy. Being around and at such quality for so long has taken a bit of a toll on Four Peaks. Still love it and will go until I don't.

This is just another trash bar in downtown. The service was so bad we did not even get past the first drink. Not only was the place dirty it smelled the way it looked. We decided to have a beer and play darts but, that was a mistake. They give us 6 of the same yellow darts which fall apart in your hand and act as though they are a gold. I went up to explain that we needed another dart cause they are falling apart one of the tips bounced somewhere in the bar. I was told not only am I not getting another dart but if I don't find the tip, I'm not getting my drivers license back. We immediately handed the darts back, demanded the license and left. There are much better places to spend your money.

I like to be positive, so I will start with the good. This is a great place to go and have drinks in the quaint western town of cave creek. The building is a nice representation of the towns old west/country feel. I have been here dozens of times and live just a couple miles away. I would highly recommend Harold's for a drink with some buddies.     With that said, I went yesterday for brunch and ordered the corn beef hash and eggs over medium. The food was not even as good as I could make at home. The hash tasted like it was out of a can and the eggs were over cooked. The bloody Mary was bland and tasted like the mix was ready to turn. You get that bitter carbonated taste.   Lastly, I would highly advise management that the cleanliness of this bar was lacking. There was trash and half eaten food from the night before still sitting on the picnic benches. Be aware that Harolds has turned more dive bar than fun western themed restaurant. Don't go out of you way unless you have already eaten and your there to see the music and drink only.

The worst branch on the planet after waiting 25 minutes I finally walked out. They only have one person I can ever help you. Whatever you do do not go to this branch.

Nice spot for lunch or dinner. Ryan the manager always goes out of his way for you. Never had a bad meal and I have been here well over 100 times. Some items are just better than others. Ask for the asparagus in your Bloody Mary.

Great Little Thai dive. This is my go to place. Very small though. If they are busy I just order to go.

What a little Cave Creek Gem. Great food! I love the crepes both sweet and savory. I took one star away because the person serving you is also the cook which makes service really slow. Other than that I have nothing but great things to say.

Dr. Athalye is a great doctor. He is quick but hears you out. Always takes care of the issue and I never have a problem. Been my primary doctor for 4 years now. I will continue to see him.

Very average at best. I ordered a breakfast sandwich which I could make better at home but it was not terrible. However the hash browns came out barely cooked. I asked if they could have them cooked a little more. The smart*** cook dropped them in the fryer and had the server bring me basically shoestring frys. The server knowing they were bad brought them to the table anyway. I told her just forget the hash browns. I would suggest you forget thinking of eating here.

I love this restaurant. I eat lunch here at least once every week. Only criticism is that they need to change up the menu a bit. A must try.

CCV is an incredible church. Their bands are great as is the message. I could not say more about the church. It is a fairly young crowd 25-50ish and the music is pumped up a bit. My 96 year old grandma might not like it as much as I do. But I absolutely love CCV and have been a member for years.

This owner is the most inconsiderate jack wagon you have ever met. I ran into this company while driving down Pima. The driver was driving crazy so I decided to call it in to his managers because I could see he was texting and driving a huge Commerical truck. The operator did absolutely nothing to address the situation and while I was on the phone with his corporate the guy pulled up to me at the light to cuss me out. I told him it's not safe to drive and text and that I was on with his office. For which he responded I own the company so **** you. Stay away from these kind of people.

Very happy with the food. I have been here 3 times. Twice in Scottsdale and once in Dallas. It is a very cool concept and the execution on the food is very good. I enjoyed the Ahi Burger and salted caramel shake. The beer selection is great. Just be prepared for a line if you go during peak hours.

I love this place. I had a messed up order for take out and live 20 minutes away. Al was more than gracious and handled it excellent. I would come back even had they not done as well but the way it was handled just assured a loyal customer. Be aware they are busy though.

If you want a juice this place is great. Only real problem here is that it is expensive. I have tried quite a few of the drinks. All good.
