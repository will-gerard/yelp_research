Good fast food chinese food at it's best. Nothing special but was our go to spot for 3 years. House fried rice and orange chicken always hit the spot. Never ate inside, just did carry out and was always quick, and polite service.

Luis made testing and getting a new battery the easiest experience. He was straight forward, to the point and polite. Can't ask for more. I plan on coming back to this location for future maintenance repairs.

My fiancé and I love this place. The happy hour is great and ebi chili is great, and spicy! The ramen is great and we're obsessed with their weird cakes. The servers are super friendly and always helpful. Sushi is always tastey.

Super friendly staff great food! The Pho is great for first timers and the Pho lunch special is hard to beat. Also love their #3, noodles, egg roll and beef. And cant say enough about their porkchops.  It can get busy at lunch but the outdoor seating is great when the weather isn't scorching.

This Brakes Plus location is consistently thorough, polite and customer focused. My girlfriend and I live in downtown Phoenix but go out of our way to have out vehicles serviced here because of the way we are treated. But most importantly because they're the ideal vehicle consultant; giving you all options, suggesting the best route but leaving the decision up to you. Now, if management could open a central PHX location.

This is a great spot for some Pho or any other classic bit smear dishes. Love that I'm so close now!

The initial set up was a little confusing but they held to their promise and showed up plenty early. The crew themselves were amazing. We have a monster of a tree in back and they weren't even here an hour and did everything as requested and left it cleaner than they found it. Money well spent!

Great karaoke spot. Little area that can get high energy real quick. I'd love to come for the food sometime but honestly can't offer a review on that.   It's a good starter place for a good night out, if not for the whole night.

Go here if you... One, want chinese or mexican and cant decide. Two, want a lot of food. Three, aren't on a diet or were and want to break it up in the best/worst way possible.   First timers, the menu can be confusing, don't waste too much time and just ask for help at the counter.

Jalepeno shots are great! A lil spicy for you novices, but nothing scorching for those who like the heat. The carne asada was great and salmon tostada was mmmtastic. Service what what you'd hope for in all restaurants, friendly faces, timely and proactive.

Korean BBQ is hard to beat. This place was always great when I lived closer, the service was lacking but who cares once the kim chee and beef came.

Went there on Tuesday for a movie screening. Understanding Harkins is not responsible for how the Screening company runs it's program, I still rank this particular theater low for a disappointing lack of customer service.  After waiting over an hour for a sneak preview we were bumped from the line based on our age (not Harkins fault) and given free passes good for only that day. All movies weren't playing for another hour so we asked Harkins if we could have different passes.   They refused. Which they have the right to do, however I was surprised at the tone of "You know what you were coming to and shouldn't be surprised with the result. You should be happy you got free passes at all."  I used to work at Harkins, not this one, and I know one person is not a representation of the theater but there's a mentality that the movie is going to show no matter what. If you have an upset client it doesn't cost the theater much to throw them a free pass.   I realized later I should have give our free passes to the next regular movie goers to prove my point.

So good. Everything you want in Mexican food, not too crazy on the greasy side but the right amount of comfort food. Don't come if you're dieting you'll want to clean up!

Wow REALLY EXPENSIVE. Not going back, there's no way I could afford it if I doubled my salary. Used to paying between $20-$30 and I left paying $97 after taking two 3 suits and a few of my girlfriends blouses. With that being said they did do a great job on fixing a hole in my pants.

Love this local sandwich spot. Very cozy and the foods solid. Nothing fancy but that's a good thing! Hope more people check it out.

Bomb.com like all the others. I'm not a fan of the WAYY west side but if your near Luke Air Force Base this is a great lunch/dinner spot. The Bul go ki, beef or pork and all the fixings is awesome and I could eat it all day everyday.

My fiancé and I really like this place. Convenient for Downtown PHX residents but near  a lot of regular things we do, so dropping off is convenient. The front desk people are always super prompt, kind, patient and quick. I wouldn't know but my fiancé tells me our clothes always comes back great.  The one thing I hope to see change and it's NOT reflective of the service, is stop the free water bottles. for an "organic" place plastic water bottles are pretty terrible for the environment.

So good and original. It's in the middle of a neighborhood which is cool. Highly suggest if you'r elike me and don't know what to try when looking for something new. Worth the cost, always solid service too.

Love this downtown coffee spot that's really easy to get too and walking distance from the light rail. Coffee is always good and the staff is always polite. The place is a little small and can fill up if you're looking to stay.

My wife and I use this as our go to quality taco spot. But I could spend all my time just sampling the salsas. Great midtown PHX spot. Parking is somewhat difficult if you come during busy hours but don't let that deter you.

Good lunch. Panang and Pad Thai are my favs. Was disappointed to learn they took off the spring rolls but the salad and soup are decent enough.

This is our go to Chinese take out spot. We've actually never been to the physical location but the delivery has always hit the spot. They offer free wontons or egg rolls it seems almost every time and the house fried rice and orange chicken always hit the spot. I wouldn't call it gourmet by any means but if you want standard Americanized-Chinese food, this gets it done.

This has everything I want in a Thai spot. Nice quiet ambience, Midtown location and the of course the food is great. I'm not a Thai expert, but my go to is Green Curry and Pad Thai and they've delivered on those.

Went to this originally when it was Gold's and since the name change things haven't been great. Same machines aren't well maintained. You'll see out of order signs for weeks, and even when they're gone stuff wasn't working. Overall it had the bare necessities and for being downtown it has a nice view. But the 1 star is more so for the service on cancellation. It's not surprising that these type of gyms don't want you to quit and make it very difficult. It's quite bad business. Front desk is always changing and the process is made up as they go.

Downtown PHX. Breakfast burritos. Local. Tiny spot. What more can you say? A little off the beaten path but then again the grand area is turning into a nice locale. Nothing fancy here just everything you'd hope for when you're hankering for a breakfast burrito.   Service was nice and hospitable too!

Very cozy and modern coffee spot on McDowell just down the road from the hospital. Staff was real attentive and quick to help. Looking forward to coming back.   Latte was great!  Good music too!

Should have heeded the long wait warnings. Would love to try this place out again but lunch in under an hour isn't an unreasonable standard. Place was maybe 60% filled and between 3 to 4 host and wait staff we gave up after waiting at our table for 30min before someone asked what happened to our food.   Unfortunately we weren't the only ones. Saw a few people speak to the manager so I assume it was a good day.   Lunch goers should avoid if time is important. The food did smell good but at those prices of hope for less than 45min dining experience.

We just had some food at their soft opening and it was what you'd hope for fish and chips. Staff was friendly and enthused and the place was cool. Exciting for more places downtown that aren't right in Cityscape. Looking forward to returning.
