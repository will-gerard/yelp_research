The pork meatball sandwich is the single best sandwich I have ever eaten! The pho is always delicious, shrimp spring rolls are refreshing, and the tea is first rate.  I always feel appreciated when I come here, and I never leave unsatisfied.

Great theatre! Super clean and nice sound in all theatres. Only caveat: I can read the prices on the beverage and popcorn menu sign thing, so when I order a medium, I want a medium, I can see that for 50 cents more I can get the large. I just don't want to pee myself when I get caught up in a good flick. But thanks anyway.

Take note of the string of bad reviews recently posted...and respond accordingly by not patronizing this horrible establishment. Bad service and worse food. Everything is way over priced and disgusting. On a bright note, my server cared about her appearance as she spent the entire time at our table staring into the mirror on the wall behind us...

I had never been to a Benihana before today, but upon hearing of their off the charts happy hour, we decided it to be a good time to try.  Well, the prices are amazing. 3.75 for just about every roll, 1.25 for eel nigiri, and 3 bucks for shishito peppers. They have a pleasant list of specialty drinks for five dollars each as well! I'm stoked now and ready to get my drink on and tear up some sushi.  Well, the sushi offerings were on the verge if being inedible. I'm not completely convinced that the seafood was the freshest in town at this moment, and the tempura on some of the rolls was nothing but flour and water and impossibly chewy. Nasty!  I will say one thing though, the shishito peppers were frigging amazing. Hence the  extra star, I will go back for those and some five buck hooch.

In a somewhat disjointed location lies a tiny gem of a restaurant. And any time I see "express" in a name I am usually hesitant to partake. But on a whim I gave Gyros Express a shot:  It's hard to argue that a proper gyro is one of every single person's favorite sandwich. And they can range from blissful to horrible... Right? Well, here you have them executed to near perfection, at least for my taste. I am a sucker for too much tsatsiki, and overly tender lamb. And solely for those reasons I whole heartedly recommend this establishment!   The inside feels and looks like the "dining room" in a doublewide trailer, and the plateware and utensils match...but who cares, the food is cheap and delicious. Skip the million places that have "pita" in their name and seek out my favorite place for gyros!   Oh, and the hummus! Go!!!!!!!

Great service and really good food. There's more Spanish and Puerto Rican than Cuban, but it's still well executed. The ropa vieja is particularly satisfying.  The house drinks are also good, the Hemingway is outstanding.  Great local restaurant that is also family friendly during the week. You won't be disappointed.

I believe this particular establishment to be the best restaurant in Arizona. I have felt this way for a while now and it's mostly because the "al pastor" is the most delicious and addictive taco or gordita around...or dish of any sort! The atmosphere is what you might expect from an authentic Mexican eatery: corny and comical, but the jukebox is solid and the Spanish soap operas are always entertaining as you wait for heaven to come to your table.  Also amazing here are the tacos de lengua, cabeza, and the soups are clean and flavorful. And the salsa bar is perfect with plenty of roasted jalepenos, escabeche and three different salsas all wonderfully distinct and properly seasoned.

Best wine store here in the valley. Great staff, incredible selection. A good place to spend a few hours and do some wishful thinking! And of course drinking!

People go out to eat for one of two reasons: to enjoy a night out and get of the house, or to get food they can't make at home. Well I can promise most of you that you can make almost the entire Don & Charlie's menu at home. So go for the experience and ambience...it's classic and memorable. And as an added bonus, the well-prepared food, while fairly standard, is well executed and delicious. Make a reservation, it is always busy, and for good reason!

Sapporo is a nice place to get your sushi fix. And by nice I simply mean that the food is fresh, and well priced. I'm not going to tell you that the rolls are amazing, the nigiri mind blowing, and the alternative menu super creative... But I promise that you will leave glad that you ate here.  Happy hour is easily one of the best deals around, sushi or otherwise. Half priced sushi and drinks are something I will always adore, especially when well executed, and in the case of the cocktails, strong.   Look, you can find better sushi at a lot of places, but more often than not, a heck of a lot worse (sushi brokers, Ra, stingray). If you're in the area, stomach begging for that soy and wasabi kick and a couple bombers, patronize sapporo, you won't be disappointed! And the edamame is done right too...with tons of sea salt.

If this review came a few years a go when I first ate here, it would be a solid four stars, unfortunately things have changed at the Greene House. The high prices I understand being in keirland but the flavor and presentation of the food don't match up. Unattentive service and an exhibition kitchen where you can watch the cooks play with their hair and scratch their ears and some other things that we all know happens but just don't want to see. The cocktail list is very cool.  Three stars if salt was included during cooking process.

Ummmm.... Ok, Maggiano's is pretty weak in food and flavor. I suspected that coming in but insisted to myself and gf that it'd be different.   For me, spinach dip is like cheesecake or tiramisu to others...I have to try it everywhere I go. It's good here, but that's where it ends. The pastas, while I've only eaten a few of them, are pedestrian at best, and because of that are overwhelmed with super rich sauces and condiments...not allowed to stand on their own.   But then again, this isn't a place famous for it's authentic Italian cuisine, or properly prepared pastas and other fare. It is well known, I believe, for it's family style offerings, so that's probably the key. Bring a bunch of your friends and family and spend two hours eating and making small talk, then spend two hours wondering what just happened, and of course recollecting the experience at reunions whilst drinking and apologizing... and blushing.

The thing that I truly love about Deseo is that the kitchen obviously treasures salt and seasoning. Each wonderful dish we enjoyed was properly seasoned, either with salt, white soy, chiles and the like. The ceviches were all amazingly fresh and balanced...great citrus, awesome garnishes and nice heat when necessary. The empanada, impossibly tender filled with moist duck ropavieja, and the loup de mer was succulent and well dressed.  The cocktails are also very strong in quality and craftsmanship. Caprihnias are my favorite here, but they're most known for the mojitos...which I can attest to their great balance as well.  If you can't tell, I had a great experience here tonight and the other times I ate here as well. Check it out.  The chocolate cigar for desert us gimmicky, but pretty damned solid.

Yasu has quickly become my favorite place in town. The food is 100% legit! The regular menu is really fun, but the menu of chef's features is the way to go. I cannot over emphasize the importance of eating here at least once. Get sushi or the tapa style dishes and you'll be hooked.  Yasu came to our table and spoke with us for several minutes and even sent out a free dessert. Awesome awesome awesome!!! Exactly what a restaurant of any type should be....fun, delicious and memorable.

Rancid smoked salmon, ammoniated sea urchin, and what seemed like a gallon of over reduced and scorched "eel sauce" on pretty much every roll ruined what I had heard from reliable sources was a good, if not great, restaurant. I really want to try it again but I am honestly afraid to. Bummer!

The worst mini-golf possibly ever created. You could build a better, more fun, and more challenging one in your driveway with some paper cups and the garden hose. However, the driving range is nice, the arcade acceptable, and the go karts are cool. I don't care about the volleyball courts, but they have some there if you want to play volleyball while watching the looks of disappointment on the children after they finish the five minute speed golfing.

I really really really want to give it five stars. And it's really bothering me that I didn't, but I feel something is missing here. I mean the food is good, try the Rasher burger and fish and chips, the drinks are cool, 3 dollar Carlsbergs, but something is seriously missing.....?   The atmosphere is nice and "pubby" and even my server the last couple times had an Irish accent, but why don't I feel right when I leave?   The prices don't knockout the wallet, and the speed of service is relatively impressive...  Ok, it's defintely worth stopping in and grabbing a burger or fish and chips, and a couple guiness', and if you feel the same way I do, let me know why, because I sure don't?????? Maybe it's the.......

THE BEST Chinese in Scottsdale and Phoenix!!! Cold jellyfish salad, anything with crab, and the sharkfin soup are all 5 star dishes. If you're lucky they'll have the abalone available, its amazing.  The atmosphere is dry and boring, the service is distant and cold, but this about food and the food only. Go!!!

Wow, I haven't ever had Vietnamese food that wasn't at the least ok. With enough sriracha, sambal, and fish sauce, you make just about anything taste good enough to eat. Unfortunately, all the sauces, garnishes, and prayers couldn't help me at Saigon Nites. It's not so much that it's flavorless food here, it's just funky.I couldn't tell if my pho was rancid, but it tasted that way. The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but "from the box" frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store. On a positive note however, my tab for soup and frozen "delicacies" only dented my cash roll 52 bucks....WTF???

I really like bar food, almost too much, and it's something I probably need help with. I can mostly thank some great spots in my home town, but locally, Zipps can be blamed for my progression.  Their burgers are consistently hot and flavorful, and the focaccias for the most part are good...even if they're just wraps. But in my book, their wings are my favorite in town. More specifically the golden medium wings have tremendous spicy/sweet balance. And their happy hour specials are some of the best deals anywhere. Anywhere!!!

If you walk into a sushi bar and are overwhelmed by the smell of BBQ sauce and there is none on the menu, leave immediately. Unfortunately I failed to heed my own premonition and "dined" here. Don't do the same please...and save the money and gastrointestinal issues.

An absolutely awesome little spot tucked away in a stripmall which proves that great food can found in the most unassuming of locations!  The pizzas are outstanding, most notably the thin crust pies. The sauces are beautifully balanced, the cheeses properly dispersed and the salumis perfectly crisp and juicy. Along with a nice red you cannot go wrong.  Our server was also one of the owners and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. I left feeling like we were long lost friends, and I felt like my dollar and patronage really mattered.   Find this place and you will find a great dining experience. And eventhough it's small, they take kindly to kids, which us a bonus when my son and I have pizza night.

A hot dog is a hot dog right? Meat in tube form with ketchup, mustard, relish, whatever. Right? Slap on some cheese, a couple ounces of chopped onions, maybe fancy it up with some sliced tomato, some jalapeño, or perhaps a dash of celery salt and some chili. What if BBQ sauce and coleslaw sounded good at the moment? What if that hot dog you had in New York that one time makes your tummy grumble?   If you can find it without google maps, or know where it is and never thought twice, because it's just a hot dog, think again, or try again...  Unfortunately, a liquor license costs more than your house most likely, so you won't find the greatest hot dog condiment here...beer.

Such a horrible location, but it's worth the effort to find it (caddy-corner to giligans). Nice curries, some spicy, but none too killer spicy...somewhat unfortunate. But anyhow, their food is always good, minus the occasional overcooked vegetable miscue. Great for lunch if you're close by and don't want to drop Malee's type cash for similar Thai.

After 45 plus reviews, primebar has a 3.5 star rating, and to me, that is legit. I'll give four plus simply because it is a great...great! Food option in NoSco after 10 pm. It's never too busy that late, the food is ultra sheik for a late night dining destination, and the drink list is fairly approachable.  Recommended: Asian tacos, any of the flat breads, calamari, and the French dip. Drink wise: the dirty martini with blue cheese olives, and the "fire and ice"! Seriously delicious!   Great service makes up for the token north Scottsdale douche bags you'll probably run into here...just ignore them, if you can. Better yet, don't make eye contact with them, or at least the guy with the "Affliction" shirt, he might try to choke you out :)

More like 4.5 stars  As far as bar fare goes, Blue 32 so far has my favorite in Scottsdale. The sandwiches are top notch, the wings are standard recipe, but really quite good. Actually, they're really good!  As far as drinks go, the dirty martini is nice, I like the blue cheese olives. Beer selection is well sprinkled with local drafts and some euro stuff.  Service is what you'd expect from a sports bar...quick and relatively distant.

Gonna keep this simple... I was excited to try what I heard was a local dining institution on a  blistering summer day. A nice, big, cold beer, award winning food, and cheery, delightful service. Ya, right.  Naked chicken wings with the extra hot sauce as I had requested were as tepid as the sauce, on the side and not dressed, was insipid. Frank's red hot with some butter and probably a sprinkle of cayenne, and a heavy handed addition of "grossness" were the worst I've had in recent memory.  My favorite BBQ item is Burnt Ends. Lovingly smoked twice and over seasoned and carcinogenic in the best way possible. Dillons' interpretation is rather unique: boil some pork, cut in cubes, dump on dirty plate and smother in brown gravy infested with cornnstarch and liquid smoke. Worst I've had in recent memory.   Oh, and that big ol' cold beer I was anxiously desiring...a 12 oz glass with two times more fingerprints on it than beer in ounces. I counted twelve separate greasy paw prints. Do the math and you'll figure out the ratio. Worse ratio of prints to ounces I've had in recent memory.  Service isn't worth mentioning. But worst in recent memory. Seems to be a trend here.

I should've known better when I entered Athena and it was hotter inside than outside. Yet I was craving some gyros and hummus and had heard good things about this place. I should've walked out when the host grabbed the last few crayons from the bowl for my son and the bowl was lovingly garnished with dead fly bodies. Man I'm an idiot.  I should've gotten up from the table when after five minutes we were completely ignored by several servers waiting for a glass of water, but I thoroughly enjoyed not only the company that I was with, but also the dozen or so extra diners that joined us by landing on our napkins, forks and faces.   I should've sent back the dip platter that was finally delivered thirty minutes after ordering. Especially because I find warm tsatsiki gross, hummus that separated into an unrecognizable film probably sometime the day before and the feta dip thoughtfully studded with wilted olives. But I digress, at least my son's fries were accompanied by ketchup so wonderful and distinct it had broken into a clear layer of oil and another layer of powdery grit, but that's probably just because it sits out in the kitchen for several hours to fully mature.  I should've asked for the manager and demanded my check to be waived, but I didn't, I just didn't.   I should've gone to Arby's.

Take this review very seriously, I am not trying to be rude or funny, or even a prisoner of the moment...I promise.  For a good 7 seven years I  have held the belief that Buca di Beppo was the worst restaurant in the area, flavorless and decrepit! But there is a new sheriff in town, and his name is Someburros, and he is more evil than Arpiao.   With food worse than what is probably served in tent city, I am now reeling in horror at what may come tomorrow or even within the hour. You see, the "meats" in both my and my gf's burros have got to be canned or canner quality, you know...Friskas. Seriously. The nachos were nothing but old, whole corn tortillas shingled with tepid beans, cold cheddar cheese, and a good 8 oz of jalepenos! Speechless...  I'm sorry, but if you check in here, check yelp for a "nearby" urgent care center.

The two star review reflects my disappointment after having such high hopes for Tanzy. I am having a hard time actually writing this because the experience hit me strangely in so many ways and I have a lot to discuss but I want to write something considerably shorter... So here it goes.  The decor is beautiful! The concept is neat! The crowd meticulous!  Now, the food...carpaccio that was so thin it melted on a room temperature fork. Zero salt minus the few fried capers and dried up convenience store Parmesan. And twice the weight of the beef was a pile of hand crushed, yes, hand crushed arugula, obviously wilted by the heat of someones gross mitts. Disgusting. Calamari steaks cut into French fry shapes and sauteed does not translate into the grilled calamari I had deceptively perceived after reading the menu. Each one of these were 14 and 12 dollars...Christ!  The more than one star review is due to the amazing cocktails we had. Whilst they each had something around 12 ingredients in them, as do all of there signatures, there was still a strikingly nice balance! Sign of a competent bartender. But my martini was 20 bucks, which I knew, and my girlfriend's cocktail was 14, for about 4 oz. But delicious none the less, and expect a wait for each one as the mixologist has to gather his mountain of mis en place for each drink.  Maybe the weirdest thing about Tanzy is that every time I have come here, at least to grab a drink before a movie, is that they let the kitchen staff just walk around the dining room and bar to watch tv or whatever. It's really funky to be shadowed by some greasy line cook who smells like sauteed, excuse me, grilled calamari while I'm trying to enjoy the smell of my 8 dollar supplement of mescal. And since the kitchen is opened up, you can have staring contests with the food runners, busboys, and line cooks as they watch you drink, eat or watch them.  Go to Grimaldi's if you're grabbing food and a /or a beverage before catching a flick next-door.

After my sixth or so visit here at Big Earl's I have to give them a four plus rating. My first time here was opening night and it was ok...the second time was improved...third time good...etc. Now when I come in the smoke is starting to impermiate in the walls leaving a wonderful smokey resonance in the dining room, and the food has become exponentially better!!!  I am like most people in the serious dining population, a lover of all things pork. And while they do some real good pig here, I am thrice impressed with the beef offerings! I like to judge a restaurant on the dishes I would absolutely return for, and the brisket is for sure that item here. Actually, the beef ribs are also one of those "return for" items as well. They, much like the brisket, are perfectly smokey, wonderfully seasoned, and impossibly tender. I highly suggest either one.  As for the sides, I can honestly recommend the collards, potato salad, and the Mac and cheese...although it's not a creamy Mac, but it is gooey enough to pass my palate's stamp of approval.   A huge selling point for me when I dine out are the drink specials, or selection. They are GREAT here!!! Being a total whisky slut, I am in heaven here, with dozens of delicious options, and the handful of beers on tap here make me happy for the change in libation after a few too many. Try the front porch cocktail, one of my top five here in town.  Big Earl's has proven that with time, all things become better. Like I said before, each separate visit has been more fulfilling than the last. I can only imagine how the experience will be, come summer and autumn, my guess is pretty damn amazing!

This burger joint is just 100% average in food. The hamburgers are very very standard (think five guys) and the fries and salads are similar. I think I have to take off a star for the weird cafeteria feel inside, and I'm tired of the whole "read the menu on a chalkboard at the front door than proceed to check out" idea. Just like at Sauce and Rumbi grill, it causes some decent traffic jams at the entrance where you feel rushed making your selections. $32 for two burgers and two beers isn't horrible, but it is when you're eating off of to-go trays. Disappointment all around.

You'll read in many of these reviews that people are excited about this location being close to home, and that probably sways the rating considerably. Normally I would have an issue with that, but in the case of this Humble, it's merited. It's a relief to have a decent pizza and non-sports bar so close, without having to negotiate the traffic of a kierland commons or scottsdale quarter. Look, the pizza is nice, it's humble pie not Bianco or Pomo, it's consistent though. The rest of the menu is also good, I really like the burgers and the salads are awesome.  In my opinion, one of the best happy hours around, especially on Monday when they offer half price on bottles of wine!
