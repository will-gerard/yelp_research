I'm not a big yelper  but this place has gone so downhill is worth warning the masses.  I use to have faith in this place but no longer.   Horrible job,  long waits.  Go elsewhere

Very good sushi at a great price.   This place is always quiet and the service is great.  Owned and operated by a husband and wife who care about their customers!   My wife and I have come here for years and they had a baby present waiting for us after the birth of our first child.   Who does that!!!!    You should definitely come here

This is the second time I have been to this location and the experiences were very different.   First of all the service was awful.   I should have walked out and regret not doing it.   My wife and I started with the simple dinner salad.   It was a very large portion but 99% lettuce.   I will say the home made croutons were awesome but nothing else.   We waited over 5 minutes for dressing that we asked 2 different servers for.   I ordered the chicken lasagna.   No nice way to say it,  it SUCKED.  Very bland and burnt.   Maybe some of the food here is good but this isn't.   My wife ordered a margarita pizza.   Not good either but wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked.  I was very disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back,  ever.   I would say do not waste your money here.  Some reviews seem good so maybe we caught them on the wrong day? ? Or ordered the worst stuff on the menu?   Either way with so many good restaurant's over here I would skip this place.

The food here was really good.   They were out of oysters but we ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail which was really good.   French onion soup and lobster bisque both awesome.   I had a mojoto for a cocktail,  it was subpar, tasted like it was a premix and not freshly made.  Dinner was the Sunday special (for 2 in our party) crab stuffed lobster, sea bass for 1 and I had the scallops.   All were very very good and highly recommended.   Sides were Brussel sprouts and lobster mashed potatoes.    I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was poor. The food was really really good but our waiter did not do a good job. He was not attentive to our table. He was told that somebody in our party was celebrating a birthday and did not even offer a dessert. He forgot to put in the order for our side dishes which did not come out with dinner. The restaurant did comp the side dishes which was a nice gesture but at a rest restaurant like this the service should be better.  The waiter seemed like he was high or just a space cadet.  I would return to this restaurant because the food was so good and I'm sure other wait staff would be better than the one we got.

Usually love this place, and I understand a pizza business is busy on a Friday night.   The problem is when you call and order and they tell you "25 minutes" then you've been standing around waiting for over an hour.  I'm not much of a complainer but did watch a lady in front of me blow up!     The manager didn't seem to want to fix anybody's problem. Just told everybody that was a big order in front of everyone else. That's fine but don't tell people that their orders will be ready in 25 minutes. Then you end up standing in a restaurant for 40 minutes.  Just tell your customers when they order that it's going to take an hour for their pizza to be ready. I think most reasonable people understand that on a Friday night a lot of people order pizza and you may have to wait a little bit. There were a lot of very pissed off people in the front of that restaurant and the manager did not seem to know how to handle them. I would guess this place lost some customers tonight

I took my wife here for her birthday.  We both thought our server was really good and she was attentive without being over bearing.   Great service.   They have great bread/butter which is complementary.   We started with oysters for appetizers,  awesome.   Also got the jumbo lump crab. . Little to full of mayonnaise so unless that's what you like,  I'd skip it.   But still not bad.   Also had lobster bisque which was good.   I ordered the swordfish steak.   I loved it!   If you don't like spicy or cilantro stay away but I love both.   My wife ordered the Chilean sea bass (hong kong style).  She was disappointed with the flavor.   I didn't think it was bad but it lacked a "wow" factor.   I wouldn't order it.   They removed it from our bill so we couldn't complain about that.   For sides we did a twice baked potato and sugar snaps with portobellos.  Both were awesome!   The prices are expensive but on par for an upscale restaurant.   I couldn't afford to go there often but I would go back in a heartbeat.  Dessert was hot chocolate godiva cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  Order it!! Soooo good.  Great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.   We got a babysitter but you could take children.  Not really a great environment for them.   Great customer service,  good place!

Best A/C company ever!   Had a part that I replaced last year go out,  they came out today and replaced it at no cost.   They are very reasonably priced and,  more importantly in this business,  honest.   Highly recommended

This place is awesome!   Not a full restaurant but the food is outstanding.  If they decide to open a full place I'm sure they would be millionaires!   Keep it up boys.

Ok so I was wondering if all the reviews were his friends and family but I gave him a shot anyway... couldn't be happier!  He showed up early for my appointment and was very professional.  I have a 2014 tundra that had a door ding in the rear door.  I called another company that told me they start at $225.  I had the PDR guy at ABRA auto body in Peoria quote me $150.  Trent did it at my house, in about 25 minutes for $75!  I cannot see the dent anymore at all!    I would recommend him to anyone and I will definitely use him again in the future ( but hopefully my truck stays out of harms way and I don't have too).  I'm not much of a yelper, I seem to only write reviews if it's really good or really bad.   Trent is really good! !!
