Nick's Italian is one of my new favorite little places. I have eaten there about six times. Some of their stuff is just okay, but some of it is great. The items that are great, are great enough to keep coming back. First of all, ANYTHING in the white wine garlic sauce is practically orgasm inducing! Especially the Penne a la Campagna! Penne pasta, chicken, spinach, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes combined with the white wine garlic sauce make for a fantastic combination. The marinara sauce is very tasty, conidering it seems to be very basic. The Cioppino in the WWG sauce is probably my second favorite thing. It seemed like an overwhelming avalanche of multiple sea creatures; Shrimp, clams, mussels and calamari. all over a huge portion of linguini. I also highly reccomend the baked ziti with sausage... Its hot!!!   Nick's has a great little dinning room. Small, but intimate. Its mildly reminiscent of some of the little restaurants in San Francisco or New York that i've been to. The service is very hit or miss. It seems like the female staff is much more enjoyable, not because of their gender, but because it seems like they know HOW to be friendly and efficient. Most of the servers at Nick's seem to be overworked, as they always rushing and and sometimes it takes longer then it should to be greeted. While there is one male server whos section i refuse to sit in, most of the other servers do a great job.

My first time at Babbo, after hearing a lot of great things. I must say I wasn't disappointed. The atmosphere was okay; nothing too exiting, but it was nice and clean. The service was prompt and attentive. I dine alone quite frequently. Often times, i experience a "set it and forget it" attitude from my servers. One they set my food down, they forget about me until its time to pay the bill. My server made sure i had refills, my food tasted good and just a general quality check before dropping off the bill. I had the stuffed manicotti with sausage, and it was great! I just wish they had oil and herbs for the bread, because I don't like balsamic vinegar, but that isn't a deal beaker. I will definitely be back to Babbo, with friends or alone.

Overall my experience at Gadzooks was a dissappointment. I had been excited to try this place for months.   First, the customer experience is extremely lacking. The place was so quiet. There was no music, no tvs; just the awkward sound of echoing conversation from the other patrons. Not the worst thing ever though. I stared at the menu for at least five minutes before any aknowledgement. Then, the only words from behind the counter were "what are you getting?" For a new place, a little helpful guidance or possibly some explaination would be great. Especially when the have several types of tortillas, meats, cheeses and sauces. I don't really know what I want yet, because I don't understand whats going on yet. everone was grumpy, except the gal at the cash register. ;/  Presentation was not great either. The ceramic dishes wer nice, sturdy and cooled quickly. The to-go packaging was really neat as well. What wasn't neat, was the soup dish. It was a cup. Like, a paper cup that you put a fountain soda in. Uh... that seems pretty ratchet. no soup bowls, or paper soup cups? Also, the food along the toppings line was just sitting in an empty steam/cooling table in what looked like storage containers. Also, they only have 2, very small trash cans that were almost un-noticeable. Napkins, straws, silverware: all seemingly happhazardly thrown in a divider next to the fountain.Did they rush to open so quick, that they cut a few corners? It defintiely seems like it. They probably should have waited another month, so that customers would have a genuine "WOW' experience.  Next was the food. Simply put, I didn't like it. I can admit that the reason for this was no fault of the establishment, but my own personal tastes. It just wasn't my type. They definitely have some decent options but they were missing an obvious staple. BEEF! At least, I didn't see any, and as I stated earlier, the employees were less than helpful, so if there was a beef option with a zany nickname, I had no idea. The tortillas were either corn, or a corn/flour hybrid. I prefer flour, so they werent my favorite. The rating i am giving here is based 90% on my experience, not so much the food.  Final thought: After much built-up anticipation, I was underwhelmed when I got in, and left feeling hungry and frustrated. Hopefully, in a few months when I give it another shot, some noticeble customer service improvmnets will have been made.

I just discovered Arcadia Premium, and I'm surprised that this isn't already a thing. You just go to the website and create an account, browse the selection and then make your choices. Its no more difficult than ordering a pizza; maybe even easier. The cashless payment process is just like Uber, super easy and user friendly. The website states that there is an app coming soon, so I'm excited to see how that makes the process even easier.  There is a good selection of red and white wines and domestic and craft beers. There's even tobacco!  Pricing is pretty good; on point with what I've seen in most grocery stores, and some stuff is cheaper than I usually see at convenience stores. There is a $5 delivery fee, but its totally worth not having to get in the car, especially if you're ordering several items. (ice, anyone?)  Delivery was fast, and the guy was really cool. I think this place is gonna blow up. I'll definitely spread the word!!

When I first visited the place, I was excited about how amazing all of the common areas were. They were not only big and well equipped, but they were just such bright and cheerful places. The swimming pool is big and inviting with private cabanas and lots of sunning chairs. There are also fire pits, barbecue grills and tvs everywhere! There is also a really cool movie theater, and probably the best gym I have ever seen at an apartment complex. You can never get bored at this place.There is also always something going on in the lobby. There have been wine and appetizer happy hours, live musicians, s'more toasting parties, and as of last week FOOD TRUCKS!!  The girls in the office are always so nice and friendly. If you walk in, you always get multiple smiles and a "hello," shouted from some corner. Even if they are busy, they give you a lovely smile and at least a nod of acknowledgement. Both of the maintenance request I've had were fixed immediately, and efficiently. The apartments themselves are really modern and spacious, and well built. The amount of kitchen space is so much more generous than anything else I looked at in that area. The grounds are always well kept, and I have not had a single issue with noise. Most of the apartments around me are also occupied, but I can barely tell. Any of the other tenants I've met have been really nice and welcoming, and I've been invited to play pool or hang out by the fire pit by several of them. Being able to expand your social skills without leaving home is so nice, and I could see myself living here for years to come. I love living at Trillium 44!
