The bruschetta is awesome!  I have taken a dozen people there and recommend the apples and brie, fig and marscapone, and proscuitto with dates and pistachios.....sometimes I get it without the proscuitto.  Perfect trendy place to take out of town guests!

The reputation of this place was stellar!  I was stoked to try some new food.  I got a dish that had the mole on it.  Definitely not for everybody.  I literally scraped this thick molasses-like substance off my chicken and it still tasted like I was eating sauce only.  I ended up eating a lot of chips for dinner that night.

I wish I had read the negative reviews before I started going here. I did most of my prenatal care here for my first pregnancy. Their Physician Assistants and Midwives are kind and consultative, but that was the only good thing. Bills were often incorrect or problematic, phone help was abysmal, trying to gain access to my medical records is still unresolved. The worst part was when I was asking about avoiding certain "routine" procedures if at all possible, the doctor said, "We conduct these procedures to make sure your baby isn't dead." How pleasant. Also, the medical assistants don't speak correctly, can't answer simple questions, are never at the front desk, and don't smile and greet you. Lots and lots of waiting around too.
