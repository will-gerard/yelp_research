overpriced but close to home. Hmmmm what to do? every time I get to the check out It feels like I just got hit in the back of the head with a bumper jack and my wallet stolen off my person. =(. they do have a starbucks inside so I can drown my pain of having just been high grossed on my grocery tab with a nice ICED AMERICANO !. bitter/sweet!

Love this place!!! There is a nation chain sub shop about 40 yards away that sells generic subs for around the same price..... My advice is to make the 40 yard dash to chÄ“ba hut and get yourself lifted off a Castro blunt!! ( large size sub) the Castro is a freaking phenomenal tasting sub!!! Lots of great local beers to quench your thirst and COOL-AID ON TAP!! You can't miss when you take a big pull off of one of these unique and delicious TOASTED subs!! Cough, cough.

Came here for our annual Christmas dinner & movie. I have to be Honest, I have never been a fan of Denny's. In my experience the service has always been poor at best and the food usually matches. I am very happy to say that this was NOT the case this time. Our waitress (Stacey)  was friendly, fast and always smiling. Our food was served hot and in a timely fashion. I believe this location has figured out how to keep people coming back........ Good food served fast and friendly staff. Simple.

The pizza was the best we've ever had!! you and taste  the freshness in the ingredients. I love the dough nuggets too!! these tasty little fella's can hold there own against any appetizer!!  We also met one of the owners who was very friendly and helpful. I love this place!! best pizza in all of the land!! the delicious cheese that is now clogging my arteries is well worth the trip.

I'm typing this as I'm still in the store not being helped. Standing in the computer department for 10 minutes watching the employees surf the Internet and talk about what they're doing tonight. The only saving grace of Fry's electronics is all the cool stuff they have!!  their service sucks and staff refused to greet you I feel like I'm walking him to Walmart with less people. I would imagine the store will go the way of ultimate universe Circuit City and all the other crap electronic stores. I should just punch myself in the junk before walking in here.

Bus 6242 @ 4:20pm Friday 2.1.2013 the female bus driver was extremely rude to three handicapped passengers, even making a terrible comment about ones weight !! I guess she thinks because the are riding public transit that it is ok to treat people like this and There will be no reprimand because she is  a union employee.  DISGUSTING display of a PUBLIC EMPLOYEE!! I think she needs to be reminded that the same passengers that she is so rude to PAY HER SALARY !!

NEVER GET REPAIRS DONE HERE!!! I'll tell you why your Vehicle and MONEY should be taken elsewhere!! I came in at 7:45am today to make sure that I got the vehicle in early so that my wife would be able to pick it up later that day with no issues. I should have know to turn around and leave when a guy looking like BABY HUEY meets BREAKING BAD came up to the counter to greet us (MITCH is his name)  After we explained what we needed he took our key and left. I had explained to BABY HUEY that my wife would be picking up the vehicle and signing for repairs. I received ONE PHONE CALL the entire day!! that was at 10:53am. I called Mitch back (BABY HUEY) at 11:23pm to approve repairs at which time he said that he had all the parts there and the vehicle would be done later that afternoon.... My wife called in at around 3:30 for an update from Mitch who told her he would check on it and call her "RIGHT BACK". she never heard back from him. After my wife text me at 5:45pm ( they close at 5:30pm)  to tell me that Mitch never called back. I called him and he told me that it would be about 30 minutes... HE LIED. My wife showed up at 5:45 and asked Mitch (BABY HUEY) why he never called her... He laughed it off and said "your husband called so I didn't think I needed to" he then left my wife in a dark lobby to finish repairs with several other mechanics ..... she did not leave there until 7:10pm..... BABY HUEY never once offer an apology for keeping her there almost two hours after closing. NEVER updated her on repair progress. never went over the repairs or cost of them and expected her to blindly charge our credit account for these repairs. Then when he couldn't find our credit account with them he left her ALONE in a dark service drive and did not come back!!!! My wife called me in tears!!! I told her that if he did not come back to leave and I would take care of the bill. This is by far the worst customer service experience we have every had!!! Mitch claimed to be the store manager and if this is true I question Fletchers judgement on employees... I called Mitch to sort out the bill and told him that I wanted to talk to the owner or the person who signs his checks. He refused to get anyone else...... needless to say we will NEVER use Fletcher's again.... Mitch single handily lost two loyal customer and there money.... Please do yourself a favor and find another repair shop!!! after coming to this location for years now... I am done with them!! I just hope that me sharing our experience  will save someone else from a nightmare like ours..    If Mitch (BABY HUEY) would have JUST CALLED AND COMMUNICATED with my wife or myself about the repairs and that it was taking longer than expected we would have been more than happy to left it and picked it up the next day. I do not want mechanics that have already put in a full days work, working on my vehicle. Now I feel like I have to take it two another shop to have these repairs inspected... the nightmare continues...........

This bar is idle for spring training games.  Right next door to Peoria sports complex. It has a great "cantina" atmosphere with a huge outdoor venue. Perfect for post game shenanigans !!!! Get a cab home though. It starts getting blurry  about sun down.  So call yellow cab, take a shot of patron and slam a glass of water. Then hit the backyard BBQ !!

the only two things that would make this place better is if they stayed open past 9pm and if I did not have to get my beer from the back of the cooler. they load the coolers from the front so you always get warm beer.

I used to be a fan until tonight! I walk up to an empty table in the bar with a few empty glasses on it and stood by it to try to get some help. After about five minutes and at least three employees looking at me as they passed me by without as much as a hello I cleared the table myself and sat down. Then the same girl that had passed me by twice without saying a word told us that our table was to be sat by the host. When i told her i was leaving , she walked away smiling. It would have been nice if one of the many employees that passed me by would has asked me if I needed anything or advised me to speak to the host. I'll stick with buffalo wild wings from now on.

It's been a while since I've been in and they still remember my name!! I moved back to the area and needed a great medical team.  It seems that it's just a turnstile move'em in and move'm  out obamacare nightmare at most places anymore.  Norterra is the exception!' I feel that they truly care about my health and want to make sure they address my issues.  Chrystal the assistant that helped me was great!! Very cheerful and eager to help!! First class all the way!!!

let me just start by saying I loath Walmart!!!! this one in particular makes me want to stab myself in the femur with a fork!!!!!!!!!!!! the customer service is non-existant and blood shoots out of my eyes so much when I come here that I get dizzy now. I will start going to target acrossed the street from now on as I value my sanity and my femur.

Every time I coming to the store it's like kicking myself square in the junk  over and over. The customer service seems to get worse and worse.  I told them that the price labels are wrong and some one should check them, the cashier looked at me like I was speaking German!! Next time I contemplate coming into the store I think I'll hit myself in the head with a hammer and see if I still feel like going after that. I suppose this is part of the high cost of low prices.

I actually had a good experience this time at Walmart, thanks to Jonathan in the outdoor living department. He could see that I need a car to offer to go outside and get me one and when he brought it back and he also wiped it down with antibacterial wipes for me.  He had a great attitude the whole way through and help me with everything that I needed. Thanks Jonathan you are Walmart saving grace. Normally I would rather perform surgery on myself with household utensils rather than going to Walmart. Jonathan made this trip a good experience, and save me from having to perform surgery on myself

Coming into Walmart is like gambling with a kick in the junk... When you walk through that door the greeter might say hello with a smile or..... HE MAY KICK YOU SQUARE IN THE NADS!!!! The latter is what I got this time around !! My wife ordered me a bike from Walmart.com  . The bike was to small and now I am trying to return it and am getting kicked repeatedly in the junk!! At least that's what it feels like!! First it takes one cashier and two managers to tell me that I have to call 1-800-Walmart and there's nothing more they can do. Then I call 1-800-Walmart to be transferred to wayfair.com and then told that I have to disassemble the bike and pay to ship it back!! I believe I've finally had it with Walmart and the HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Do yourself a favor and go to target!!! This  store  is a joke!!!

After loosing my doctor to a concierge medical service I have been shopping around for a great doctor.  I believe I have found one! Called in for an appointment and was expecting one days away. instead, they scheduled me for the next day!! My appointment was for 8 a.m.  I was expecting to be waiting for a while and to my surprise I was called back just a few minutes after 8 a.m.  The doctor was great and even gave me some tips to get my scripts cheaper! all in all a great visit!

Not very impressed with this pizza joint. the hostess will not place you on the waiting list unless ALL of your party is with you. so don't bother getting there early to get a table for your peeps unless you enjoy waiting that much longer. pizza was o.k. at best. they are also a little to proud of the pizza. the wings did hit the spot though

First time here and I must say it is very nice to find a local repair shop that is honest and professional. I took my Chevy Tahoe in for an oil change and they really went the extra mile and rotated the tires, checked fluids and found a few issues I was not aware of. All this for a better price that the big box lube shops. I now have a new repair shop!!!

This was my first time here and I was in desperate need of a cut!! Me and a friend got there a few minutes before they opened @ 10am and as soon as they opened our barber greeted us with a frosty bud light. My friends eyes lit up like a 10 year old on Christmas day when he cracked open his can to get a little hair of the dog. the barbers here are funny, helpful and have a great attitude. the shop is clean and has lots of  flat panel tv's to watch sports highlights while you get clipped and sip a cold one. first class all the way!!! thanks for the cut J!!!

I have been looking for a barber shop on my side of town for over a year now.  I have had to travel to north phoenix (60 miles ) to get a quality hair cut and good service. I FINALLY found a GREAT barber shop in my neighborhood.  This place had a an old world "Mayberry" feel to it that takes you back to an age in America when all was right in the world!! Greeting with a warm smile and a "come on in" attitude make this shop a pleasure to wait in.  Beautiful sprawling hardwood floors cover the whole shop and makes me think that if I had the right secret handshake or code word they might offer me into the speak easy in the basement!!! And my hair has never looked better! Great cut and service!!! I'm happy that I finally found a locally owned barber shop that fits me!!

La Grande Orange will always be a favorite place of mine. it may have something to do with the fact that I proposed to my future wife at this event. I'm a fan for life!!!  the English muffins are the best I've ever had and the staff is world class!!

This Place changed my life!! no really!! I have never had "bar food" taste this great before!! This is bar fare at it's finest!!! The beer is outstanding and I believe that I am a better man now for having drank it!!! If you want a bud light and  crappy chicken wings then this is NOT the place for you!! expect the unexpected here!! the guy that sat next to us had been coming here for a while and mapped out the menu and beer for us. What a Great place!!! do yourself a favor and try EVERYTHING !! they also let you bring your dog to the outdoor seating!!!!

Took the jeep in for an oil change. price was right and my service adviser was great. they only bad thing was that I actually was interested in a Jeep Wrangler but not one sales person so much as said hello to me in the 1 1/2 hours I was there.

Great hair cut and a beer??? I'll take it!! They got me right in and gave me a 5 star cut and a brew to go with it!!! Nothing like a fresh cut from this crew!!

First Time in here and I must say, the torque wrench sandwich is the best I've ever had!! Add a side of meat whistles and your in serious business!!! Beer is ice cold and I got a shot of Jaegermeister on the house! I saw a midget crawl out of a tool box, which I thought was kind of odd, but who am I to judge!!?!!!?!  All in all a great time!!

Well.... I write the review with a bit of sadness because I didn't even get to try the food or BEER. when we walked in there is a station that appears to be where you would go to be seated. After standing there for a minute without EVER burning acknowledged by a staff member we decided to belly up to the bar and get some beer and food.  Our green haired bartender didn't even say hello to us as she slid a few menus in front of us.  She did come back and asked my wife if she wanted something to drink...... Totally overlooking me and walked away after giving my wife her water. Instead of asking me if I wanted anything to drink she instead went back to flirting with with the fella next to us.  At this point we were so disappointed we decided to leave and go somewhere's do you eat and drink after the Diamondbacks game.  I feel very let down because I was so excited and looking forward to trying this place outout after sampled there beer at a YELP event. At this point I don't see myself going back.  :(.

Cox has been charging me for phone service that has NEVER worked since the first day we moved to our new address.  I have called many times only to get transferred and disconnect.  .  Horrible!!   Now they tell me that I must pay the bill and " then we can sort it out" do your self a favor and switch to century link!!!

So this being my first time in I decided to try the hot wings.  That was the perfect choice for the hop shock beer!! Then a patron offered me a zappolli. It's a little doughnut hole looking thing that must be filled with crack... Because I couldn't stop eating them!!! Great place!!!! Top notch food and great service make this a great neighborhood pizza joint!!
