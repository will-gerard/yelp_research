Truly enjoyed the amazing food at Siam Orchid! I was craving Thai Food and we drove over 20 miles to get here. The menu selections were very well written - and to our pleasure the appearance of each dish and the taste exceeded our expectations. A great place for authentic Thai.

Still get great service here no matter what time of day or night. Another local business to support, especially with all the big boxes surrounding him. Gantzel Farms used to be the only place to go years ago - I still visit them whenever I can. Support the mom and pops in your local area!

The best place to support the local guy! In Queen Creek for many years, Russ True Value still has that little town feel and great service without all the big box flash. I like it that they know me by name and take the time to help me with whatever I need. I vote with my dollars, so good service is important to me. We need more places like this in our community.

Visited the Old Pueblo for lunch. I had high expectations as was told this was a great place to eat. I ordered the Machaca with rice and beans. I received what looked like a small piece of shoe leather. The taste was ok - but I have had better. Since I am an artist and feast with my eyes first, the appearance of the meat really affected my ability to eat it. It it weren't for the rice and beans helping to cover it up I don't think I could have eaten it. The price was pretty high for lunch - both of my children also ordered lunch and they only ate part of each meal. I don't allow my kids to be picky eaters - the rule is if they order it they have to eat it. I tasted both of the dishes they ordered and both were bland with hot chili sauce the main ingredient.   The best part of our meal was my friend's margarita (which I sipped on). I could not have one of my own because I was driving.

Want some sort of stringy chewy grey, meatish? looking stuff covered in fake cheesy, oily gravy nastiness with a huge side of gas? .......................Then eat here if you dare.  Serrano's used to be good when they first opened in QC. Oh, for the good old days! They need to seriously redo their recipes........not just make the menu and marketing campaign pretty. EEE  GADS!!!

I was quite impressed with the Clearance Center! Lots of selections and a huge huge store! I bought $500 worth of dress clothes and shoes for under $100. For someone who hates to shop- this is truly something! You kind of have to know how to sort through the racks of clothes, but I was patient and it paid off. David, in the shoe department, was especially helpful.

Craving Mexican but want something healthier or a little different? Cantina Laredo has it all baby! I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass with fresh asparagus and cilantro-lime rice! All I can say is "WOW." Totally knocked my socks off! Serving size was just right and the server was attentive and cheery.

Great little Sushi place - I enjoy the atmosphere as much as the fresh, delicious fish. Courteous and caring service.

Haven't been here in a while but was treated to lunch yesterday by my boss! I ordered the half Cuban Sandwich, with a side of red, ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella salad. Yum! It was outstanding! The sandwich was too large to fit in my mouth so I had to cut it up with a knife and fork. The pork was tender, juicy and delicious - and was bought from the local Pork Shop here in Queen Creek.   For desert I ordered the warm lava cake with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream and whisky sauce. Oh my! I think I am hungry again! My boss is a Southern gal who knows that good food = good teamwork. I hope she doesn't think I was a pig! Next time, lunch will be on me. Oink Oink!!

Now I can't speak Greek - or cook Greek - so it's all Greek to me! But this place has some good eats! (as Alton Brown would say). So grab your dollars, your Euros - or if you are old enough to remember the drachma - grab those too! The best and only Greek Food in San Tan Valley / Queen Creek. Tell them Bridgette sent ya!

Not being from Chicago I can't say that this tastes like the real thing BUT I can say that I was delightedly surprised - everything was delicious! Service was great! Tomatoes in my salad were ripe, red and sweet.

I don't normally eat pizza since being on my new life diet but had two slices at Barro's last week and was really impressed. This is NOT your normal dry, icky slice of overcooked pizza folks! The crust was just right and the toppings were fresh and superb! YUM. Well worth the drive to CopperBasin. Not to mention the decor and the booths make you relax and want to have fun.
