Called ahead to see if they had any appointments to get my brake lights checked out. Chuck was very nice and told me that he had appointments available all afternoon. I decided to stop by on my way home.   Upon arriving he explained what the issues could be and told me that he could check my car out, free of charge. After a short wait, he came back and told me that he had fixed the light bulbs and reset my check engine light! He explained what the problem was and recommended I get a fuel flush.  I didn't have time at the moment, but you better believe I'll be back to have that service done at Just Brakes with Chuck. Being that it's obvious I know nothing about cars, it was really great to have someone suggest a simple solution with absolutely no pressure.   Great experience!

Really awesome salon! I have walked in both times I've been in, and there was very little wait time. I have gotten the same girl both times and she is absolutely fabulous! They use the liners in the pedicure tubs, and it's super clean in there. They have a bunch of regulars that come in, and I feel like that's really saying something. The true test of a good salon for me is if they get my full set right. And they did. Definitely becoming my regular salon.

I'm always looking for places that use more natural ingredients or essential oils in their products. I stopped by this place for the first time a few days ago. I like an environment where I don't feel pressured to buy anything, and that's definitely not how I felt here. The girl who was helping me showed me all the different products. I really liked one of the scrubs, but I was not expecting to spend that much money my first time in. So I went with some olive oil soap and a muscle ease cream. A few days later I went to return the muscle cream, simply because I had changed my mind, still completely sealed. I was told that there was nothing they could do. That they don't do returns. When I asked where it said that, she proceeded to look at my receipt and say that it's "usually" on the bottom but that the sign behind the register says they don't. Really? Completely upset, I contacted customer service, it's been a few days, and they still haven't gotten back to me. I probably will not be returning to Lather. I gave them two stars because their products are really nice, but it's not worth the terrible customer service. I'll be sticking to shopping at my usual place for these kinds of products.

If you're looking for good food, a cozy environment, and anything Italian, this is the place to go! Came here on a recommendation, and I'm so glad I did! I got an Italian combo and it was amazing. Walked around the store for a little bit, and found 00 flour, Italian cookies, and a restaurant in the back! It was busy and I totally understand why. They have a large variety of fresh pastas and cheese. Deli meat galore. I will certainly be back to eat on the restaurant part of it.

This is not your typical convenience store. The owners are absolutely wonderful and take requests! They have an incredible craft beer selection but still have all the popular options as well. They also carry a good assortment of wine as well.   The most important part to me, is the customer service. I will drive out of my way to see Deep and Meeta and support our local businesses. They always listen to what you want in stock, and if they can they will order it.   They recently added a growler station that has a variety of different sizes and lots of different beers. I would highly recommend this hidden spot. It's completely worth checking out.

When I'm not in the mood for Starbucks this is definitely my go to place for something a little different. I get the Blue Rebel infused with passion fruit and it's delicious. Unfortunately for this location, it's always super slow.   The drive thru line is constantly wrapped around, so if you want your drink a little faster make sure you walk up to the window.  No matter what Dutch Bros I go to, they are always super upbeat and cheerful and that was definitely the case at this location.

I'll start off by saying that I love chipotle, but this location is a constant hit or miss. I'm use to having to wait in line, but today was just excessive. Last time I stopped in, there was one person on the entire line filling orders during lunch time.   There have been times when everything's great but today was just not one of them. This is the closest chipotle to my work, so it's inevitable that I will be back, it just doesn't compare to some of the other locations I've been to.   All chipotles are not created equal.

I did a lot of research as to which place was really the best to sell my jewelry, and was starting to get discouraged. I finally came upon this place and it's fabulous yelp reviews! I have to say, I'm so glad I came here instead.  Eric was wonderful. He truly made me feel like he was giving me a great deal on the jewelry I brought in. I didn't feel pressured, and he was very informative on why the value was what it was. He made sure to inform me on all the options I had, without making me feel like I was obligated to do anything.  It was a no pressure experience with wonderful costumer service. I will definitely be coming back here for any other jewelry needs I might have.

This Total Wine is huge! Granted it's in Vegas, so go big or go home, but it's definitely got a huge variety of wine. The people are informative, and know their stuff. Take the time to walk with you and explain the differences and what might appeal to you. Good customer service is definitely a plus in a place like Total Wine.  Overall really good experience and super pleasant people that helped us out on our wine adventures while our vacation took us to Vegas :)

After a very frustrating phone call to my insurance, who told me they couldn't replace my windshield for another 3 days, I decided to give this company a call. They had such wonderful reviews, I figured I'd give them a shot.   I called to get an out of pocket quote and their price was significantly lower than the other places were offering! The woman was very helpful, and I explained my problem of not being able to see out of my windshield at all. She said she didn't have any appointments for that same day, but she would move some things around just to get me in.   Incredible customer service. They were even early to come replace it. Very courteous, and respectful. I will definitely be coming back and recommending this place for any future glass repair that we may need in the future.

I will start off by saying that the food was really quite yummy, but what totally ruined this place for me was the service. My boyfriend and I walked over after a movie, and sat at the bar. Being our first time, we asked a few questions about what to try and how things were prepared. The girl taking our order could not have seemed more inconvenienced. It was not busy, and they were still open for two more hours, but she sure seemed to be in a rush to stop answering our questions. We ate, had some drinks, both of which were very good. We wanted to place an order for another eel roll, but the waitress was too preoccupied talking to her coworker to notice. Seriously, not worth the money. There are so many places in the area you can get better sushi and better service, don't waste your time here.

Gave this restaurant another chance, and I must say that the experience was certainly much better. The food here never fails me! It's always so yummy. This time I had the Chilean Sea Bass and I would definitely recommend it.   I sat at the sushi bar, and it was nice and quiet. Both my server and the guys at the sushi station where awesome with all of my questions and there recommendations, where exactly what I wanted. I also had the fresh water eel, and it was also delicious. I was so content with my dinner, and appreciated the excellent customer service. The only thing I would change, is maybe adding some more choices to their hot menu. I mean, I realize it's a sushi restaurant but some variety would be nice as well :)   Wonderful experience over all though. My server was wonderful, the food was great, and Clayton the manager was very attentive.

Definitely a great place for burgers that are a little different. The environment is comfortable and the food is delicious. This is my second time back and I have yet to be disappointed. I would definitely recommend the truffle fries! They are delicious!   They have some really great beers and in the full bar right in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, great food and a really relaxed environment. It's a little on the pricey side as far as burgers go, but it's completely worth it.   Also, definitely have the milk shake after your meal! One of the best I've ever had!

Grecia is absolutely wonderful! My daughter has never been happier. I'm always very skeptical about in home daycares but I couldn't be happier with this one. She's super flexible with hours, which is great for me because I work retail. They eat home cooked meals. The child to teacher ratio is perfect. She comes home with adorable little songs that she learned. If you're looking for an amazing place to look into for your daycare needs, this is the place!

I dined here after my boyfriend had previously brought home a pizza from this same place. We got some garlic bread, which was alright. And ordered the same pizza we had gotten before. As we started eating, I noticed that there was A BUG in the ranch I was dipping my pizza in. I took the bug out and put it on my plate. I showed the server and she went to tell her manager. A few minutes later she came back and told me that their ranch was kept in the fridge, already portioned. Essentially telling me that there was nothing they could do about the BUG that was in ranch because clearly it wasn't THEIR fault that the bug was in my food. The manager did not come and apologize, nor did she offer any kind of explanation. I never even met the manager. They didn't even offer to comp the meal. Needless to say, I did not continue eating after that.

Amazing nail salon! Yesterday, Tracy did my nails and they were absolutely perfect. I came here because it had such good Yelp reviews. The place is clean, they have wonderful customer service. They really make you feel like they care. I hate going to a nail salon, and being ignored for half of my service. But that was certainly not the case here.   I would say prices are about average for what most nail salons offer. But the quality of work is definitely worth it. I definitely will be back, is so close to my work. It's kind of hidden in the parking lot behind Walgreens. The only complaint I would have is that there were no clear prices anywhere. I expressed that to her, but she told me that their new brochures where not there yet. Totally fine.  THEY USE LINERS! Totally a must while getting a pedicure. I didn't get one this time, but that's definitely the next service I will be trying.

The new drive thru location is now open! Right off of Tatum and Shea! Beautiful location, that's got a great outside seating area with misters! So happy that there's finally a drive thru location on my way too work. This isn't a location that has an inside seating area but that's ok, there's a few others around that do offer that.   Today was there official opening day and to say I got my drink and food quickly and efficiently. So excited to make this location my new regular stop!

I use to frequent the first location on 67th and Happy Valley, but since I no longer travel in that direction I was extremely excited about this location so close to my home! I get the carne asada burrito enchilada style and its delicious. They have lunch combos and a little bit of everything. It's basically the only Mexican restaurant in the areas and it's definitely worth checking out!
