Been to the Paisley a couple times now and really enjoy the atmosphere and food. They have a large beer and wine selection, and their food items are all unique. If you're a vegetarian, a good portion of the menu is devoted to delivering compatible foods. Some nights they have live music or DJs. Both times I have gone I dined inside, but there appears to be a large outdoor patio that looks perfect to chill on some spring or fall afternoon.  It is always encouraging to see businesses like the Paisley operate in the downtown Phoenix area. I will continue to support the Paisley and highly recommend it to others looking for some uniqueness in Phoenix.

The Wrigley Mansion is one of a few historical venues in a city that does not value its past and history. That said, you would think that fact would guarantee a top quality meal and fine dining experience at Geordie's Restaurant. Regrettably, Geordie's turned out to be no better than any other overly-hyped but underwhelming restaurant one would find at a 4- or 5-star resort.  I have lived in the Valley for nearly 10 years, and last night was the first time I had ever visited the Wrigley Mansion. I always felt somewhat guilty for never have visited, but I can say with near 100% certainty that my first visit is also my last. The service and wait staff performed well, but the food was the equivalent of one might get at Applebee's, and certainly not worth what I paid.  I started off with the carpaccio, which was probably the most disappointing part of the meal. I have had some mediocre carpaccio before, but never this poorly prepared. I suspect a bad cut of beef. I also ordered a side of their white truffle fries that arrived with excessive garlic. The fries themselves were overcooked and tasted like Jack In The Box fries. Generous amounts of catsup were required to make them somewhat edible. For the entrée I tried the server-recommended lamb chop, which I requested to be prepared medium. When it arrived, it was clearly not medium. The meat was tough and lacked any flavor, and the au jus was entirely too salty.  The beverage service was quite prompt, however I think the bartender should go back to mixology school. The Manhattan I ordered had too much vermouth and hardly any bitters, while the lemon drop was neither sweet or bitter.  The purpose of the evening was to celebrate a friends birthday, so our dinner party had a whole room to ourselves. Given the size of the party, the wait staff did do an excellent job of making sure we were well served. Our glasses were never empty and the food did arrive promptly. Unfortunately, that alone could not make up for the poor food quality and exorbitant price.

Yesterday for lunch, a few coworkers and I went to Pho Nhat. It was my first time there, however my coworkers had previously gone on several occasions and raved about the pho. Since it had been quite some time since I had pho, I was looking forward to the experience. Perhaps it was simply a case of mis-aligned expectations, but I expected more in light of my coworkers opinion of the food. The portions are generous and inexpensive, yet the taste was bland, even by pho standards.

Secondhand, consignment, or speciality clothing boutiques are nothing new, yet Buffalo Exchange manages to carve a niche that is uniquely distinct. The challenge with some secondhand clothing establishments is their lack of quality control. Some other stores will accept just about anything that they receive, regardless of condition and style, while others will only accept the very best and justify charging a premium. Buffalo Exchange is different in that they have standards on what they will accept, yet they remain an excellent bargain.  I used to shop at all the mall establishments, spending $50 for a basic shirt that really cost all of $5 to manufacture. Dropping $500 might only net me a few shirts and a few pairs of pants, at best. Buying clothing is like buying a new car - you get to be the first to wear it, but in the end there is nothing wrong with buying used, as long as the previous owner took care of the item. For less than $100 at Buffalo Exchange, I can buy 5 new complete outfits. Because there is such a wide variety of styles, what would have taken multiple trips to multiple stores can be accomplished with one visit.  Importantly, I am recycling a commodity and putting money back into the local economy, rather than directly supporting a business built using poor or child labor conditions in a sweatshop abroad. Whenever I'm finished with old clothes, they go back to Buffalo to be used by someone else.

I have wanted to visit Matt's for quite some time now. My attempts have always been thwarted due to the extraordinary lines, the lack of time, and a growling stomach. Today, finally, I remedied that situation and finally ate at Matt's.  Is Matt's overhyped? Perhaps. The small venue nearly guarantees a long wait. Is the food worth it? That is always a matter of opinion, but in mine, I think it was. I ordered the pancakes, pancakes that happened to be lightest and fluffiest I have probably ever eaten. For a side, I chose the cranberry walnut toast. It was good, as expected. Toast is hard to mess up unless obviously burnt. The friend who ate with me ordered the special that day, an egg scramble with sausage, havarti, and sweet peppers and rosemary. After sampling a bite, I wish I had ordered the special instead. The pancakes were good, but the special was great.  Will I go back to Matt's? The answer is yes, though realistically it may not happen for a while due to the typical long wait times. Given the fact a wait is common, it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting.

Copper Star Coffee is one of my favorite local, central Phoenix, coffee houses (in addition to Hob Nobs and Lux). Copper Star Coffee is located in a converted, vintage, automotive service and gas station right along a growing 7th Avenue corridor. What sets Copper Star apart from some of the other local coffee houses is their car hop service. There are times when I find myself in a hurry and a drive through is convenient. Although there is a Starbucks equipped with a drive through a mile north, I prefer to keep my dollars local and the fact that Copper Star has a drive through help me do just that. Each time I visit Copper Star, there is always something different in the way of pastries or muffins. On one visit in November they had scratch-made pumpkin and raisin muffins. I'm not a big fan of pumpkin in any form other than pie, but I over heard someone there mention they were really good. Being in a festive mood that day I bought one and was very pleased. As far as I know, everything is made in-house or is local. The Batista's pull a mean shot. When it's 110 degrees out, nothing tastes better than an iced double americano (no cream). I'm not sure where they get their coffee from exactly, but it full-flavored without being over roasted. Free WiFi is a great perk as I've gone there several times to read my morning digital news. The staff is always friendly and the service prompt.

My first experience with SideBar to attend a friends birthday gathering. When I was invited, the first words out of my mouth were "What's SideBar?". I'd never heard of the place before (it apparently opened the week prior).  Upon entering the establishment, you are greeted with a flight of stairs. This is not a place for someone with a physical disability as there is no other means of getting to the upper floor. The second floor containing the bar is dimly, yet appropriately, lighted. Dark woods and exposed brick are contrasted with retro white, Jetsons-meet-IKEA furniture. The beverage selection, for both beer and hard alcohol, is extensive. The staff is ever friendly and attentive, but I think they might need a little more experience as a mixologist (the ratios seemed a little off).  This bar has the style and class of something you'd expect in Scottsdale, but none of the snobbery, while coming across as a comfortable neighborhood bar.

Turf is a great neighborhood bar. If you like to go somewhere, sit outside on the patio, sip a Hoegaarden, and enjoy the complimentary WiFi, then this is your place. Here you'll find the typical pub-style food, and while satisfying for what it is, don't expect to be wow'ed over. That said, weekend brunch isn't that bad and the price is good.  During some evenings they have live music and the place becomes quite packed with patrons. As Turf lies within easy walking distance of the downtown ASU campus and the light rail, they are just as accessible as say Rula Bula is on Mill Ave in Tempe.  Overall, a great hang out neighborhood pub.

After my third visit to Moira, I decided it was time for a review. First, the good. The location right in the heart of CenPho is perfect. The venue appropriately decorated. The vibe is eclectic. Now for the not so good.  Each time I've dined there, dishes other than sushi were quite tasty, however their sushi really could use some work. When the name of your establishment contains the product you sell, you need to deliver on that one product above anything else. Moira fails to deliver in this critical area. To put into perspective, it is not that their sushi is bad, it is just mediocre and on par with Ra. So just in the same way that Ra is not necessarily bad, neither is Moira. But the expectation as a diner of a locally owned, unique restaurant, is that the experience would be better than a chain restaurant like Ra.  The first two times I dined at Moira, the service was acceptable, yet the third time was not. This was in spite of notifying Moira ahead of time that we would consist of a large dinner party of 12+ people. The night we dined, I saw all of two servers for the entire restaurant. It was not until later that a third server came on duty, but by then it was too late. For a dinner party as large as ours was, we really needed a dedicated server.

As someone who is originally from Seattle, I firmly believe there is no such thing as too many coffee shops (just too many Starbucks). The more coffee establishments in central Phoenix, the better for the rest of us. I've been to Lola nearly every weekend since they first opened, and I have to say that I'm a fan. I typically stick to a simple iced Americano coffee, so since I have not tried their other mixed beverages I can't comment. Their roast is rather strong (which I like), but some people who might prefer a milder roast should stick with something mixed with milk. Lola has a variety of small pastry, cookies, and granola food items, so while not a full-fledged café they still have a decent selection of bites. Prices on the coffee are in line with what you might pay at a Starbucks, so while Lola is not the least expensive coffee place, at least my money is supporting a local business and economy instead of Starbucks.  The venue is minimalist, but comfortable. The interior receives significant amounts of natural light due to the nearly floor to ceiling windows. The exterior area enjoys a small patio area with several tables and chairs. The WiFi is free and actually works, and there is plenty of power to plug in should one need it.  I have heard they are planning to open another location in downtown proper sometime later this winter. I'm not sure how I feel about that, to be honest. There is something to be said about an unique experience. If the owners plan to open another Lola, I hope they make the venue and experience distinct, rather than attempting to carbon copy the success of the original store and diluting the brand.

A little over a year ago I began traveling quite extensively for work. As a result, I was infrequently home and when I was home the last thing I wanted to do was clean. Enter Busy Bee House Cleaners. Over the course of a year, Busy Bee House Cleaners would come once per month and perform a superb job cleaning my home, freeing up my time when I was at home to spend on more important tasks. The value to me was far greater than the actual cost, so it was definitely a win-win. The cleaners and company consist of honest and trustworthy individuals (they had a key to my home and cleaned when I was away on business); I never harboured any concerns.  I gladly recommend Busy Bee House Cleaners to my neighbours and friends. I recently move away from Phoenix, so I obviously no longer use their services, but should I ever return to Phoenix I will most certainly re-engage with the company.  Full Disclosure: The owner of Busy Bee House Cleaning is a personal and professional colleague of mine. The review and opinions expressed here are mine alone, given without influence and based solely on my business relationship. I did not receive material compensation for my review.
