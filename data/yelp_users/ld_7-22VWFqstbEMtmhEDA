The pie and service is what is being reviewed.  First, the cashier points to the counter exclaiming "put it (the pie) down here now".  Ok.  My partner who carries her service dog in a closed carrier with her is then asked by the owner if the dog is a service dog.  She says yes, he then proceeds to blatantly and loudly ask her for her documentation,  which is illegal.  He then proceeds to tell her to leave.  We do, rhubarb pie in tow.  Already the experience is so that we will not ever come back.  Hopefully the pie is good.  It's not.  I can make a better pie with the dust I swept off the floor and about half the oil and gelatin they put into it.  Never again Rock Springs, never again.

Consistency eludes this place.  First two trips were pretty good.  My third and final trip was so awful I will never return.  When you walk in you don't know whether to order at the front, seat yourself, wait to be seated?  The tarragon biscuits are awesome except some are awesome and some are crackers.  My partner had a creamy beautiful hollandaise and mine was a clumpy coagulated mess.  Emailed the owner...nothing.  Good luck with the catering business.

My experience here was almost perfect.  Food, atmosphere, service and coffee were exceptional.  French family who are proud of what they do, and it shows.  Can't wait for next saturday morning.  Oui Oui.

Great fresh food, great service, reasonable prices.  You can't ask for anything else.  The bartender and wait staff are obviously proud of the food they serve.  The sushi chefs themselves are like quiet, honorable ninjas doing a great job in the name of honor, not glory.  Will go back time and time again.

Tacos Kissi is owned and operated by the Kissi family.  Ruby is the cook and her son Hymen is the front of house.  Best mexican I have had in a long long time.  Damn it's good. Fresh salsa and amazing tripas, carne, al pastor, lengua, and everything else.  Haven't tried the sushi.  I have been here 10 times this week no joke.  The torts combo with fries is buy bueno.  I mean exceptionally good for $7 and change.  Love it.
