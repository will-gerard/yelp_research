I give this local neighborhood hot spot five stars. Owned by Pizzeria Bianco's Chris Bianco, this sandwich/panini joint bakes fresh bread daily made fresh to go, and although the menu is limited usually to three sandwiches and a foccacia bread, it's well worth it. The Market Sandwich which can change is always my favorite. From fresh mozzarella and tomato to superb meats, they can never go wrong. This is a great in and out spot and there is only outdoor seating next to Lux Coffee bar. They also offer salads, fresh baked bread, fig jam and chocolates. I highly recommend this hot spot!

Best Happy Hour in Town. Sunday, Monday, Tuesday half price bottles of wine, drink specials and from 3PM to 6PM, $5 menu items.  The Rokerij is one of my favorite little spots. Great, cozy downstairs bar with fireplace, good music and great staff. It can get a little crowded but worth it.  Great spot for a date!  The small plates are my favorite.  The bacon wrapped scallops, brie toast and chile relleno.  The plates are very rich, however.  I think they have an amazing wine list and I've never had a dissapointing wine.  They spend time on their wine and having wine sales experience, their buyer knows their wines.  It can get busy for happy hour, but well worth the wait my friends.

I am so impressed with Dr. Cas and the staff.  They spend so much time on you unlike those quick in-and-out chiropractic offices.  Dr. Cas spent a lot of time going over my x-rays and explained every bone and muscle that was compromised.  They always take their time and are completely amazing.  I would highly recommend this place!

I give everyone a fair chance and I am a foodie and wine lover but I put the Vig on blast! I have frequented this bar/restaurant in the past merely for their atmosphere, pretty scenery and great patio; however, more than a few times the service has been downright unprofessional and staff rude from time to time.   I was recently in the restaurant with a fairly large party and we all ended up with food poisoning from the hummus and baba ganoush. I wasn't so upset that it happened because it's a risk one takes but what happened after I will never forget. After nicely calling the manager Pam, I only wanted to inform her of what had happened so that others would not get sick and she quickly became defensive and told me that it was impossible we could get sick on hummus. Sadly but true in my opinion she must have never taken a food safety class. As most of us know bacteria can grow in protein and hummus is all protein. She argued me and I quickly responded with the fact that eight people getting sick is no coincidence. As a manager in the past, it's right to sympathize with the customer, not defend. I wanted nothing from her but she quickly told me she would tell the chef and "sorry, hope you feel better", and she hung up the phone. This tells me the Vig's management is not only unprofessional but downright awful.   I never thought their food was that great anyway and it's a step up from bar food but if you want drink menus tossed at your table, long waits before being greeted, rude staff and food poisoning, then check out the Vig. If you don't want to park in valet, be careful parking in the check cashing parking lot because it can be dangerous crossing that busy street.

Want to get screwed royally? Then this is the place for you!    Their friendly faces are always awaiting for you as you enter through the doors until you become their customer and sign on the dotted lines.  I was moving and told them I had lost my job and wanted to cancel.  They talked me into going into a lower 19.99 rate and forgot to tell me that I couldn't cancel my membership after the new rate locked me into a 6 month contract (never signed anything either).  When I went to cancel they wanted me to pay for the remaining months my contract was locked into...KNOWING I was moving.    I also spray tanned one day in which the "new" towels had bits of glass and cut me.  I showed the girls and they mentioned they were new towels and just said "Oh my" and threw them in the back.  No apology or are you okay?  Nothing!  They are inconsiderate, non-ethical and completely disrespectful...but, if you want to be taken advantage of and locked in for life, I suggest Planet Beach!

Don't let the Triple A approved sign fool you!  This place has no ethics or morals are bound you take advantage of you!  I was in a accident and had triple A refer me over.  I left my vehicle there but decided to go with another autobody shop.  When I called them they avoided my calls and finally reached me later saying that they had already fixed part of my car.  I knew they were lying because nothing happens the same day and when I got down there they had completely lied then held my car for ransom.  I ended up having to pay almost $600 to get them to release the vehicle.  Zachary Holm's was upset I had chosen a different body shop.  They not only flat out lied, they took my bumper which is my property.    If you want a distrustful, lying auto body shop, then look no further.  It's sad that people like this will prey on people like myself who just had an accident.  I will do whatever it takes to educate the public on scam artists like this! I hope no one else has to pay the consequences like I did.

Want a gym without the loud grunts, over achievers and guys that never saw a mirror they didn't like, then this place is for you!  I can actually get a workout without some nut job trying to talk to me. Clean, friendly and exactly the necessities you need for a great workout!

This is a great local, neighborhood greek spot.  I recommend taking it to go, you won't be dissapointed.    This is a family owned business and the food is equally as good every time.  I recommend the gyro plates, hummus or vegetarian plate.  The chicken gyro plate is my favorite and all their food is very flavorable.  So far, this is the only local spot I would recommend in the NW area.  It puts other greek gyro places to shame!

If you appreciate middle-eastern food an/or persian food, you will "love" Pars.    The owner is always in the back cooking up an amazing and consistently great tasting meal.  By far, they have the best hummus in town.  Pars puts Pita Jungle's hummus to shame.  All of their meat skewers are great but the mahi mahi is out of this world.  He also cooks amazing Zeresch Polo (rice with barberries) and everything is so flavorable.    Although it's hidden in NE Scottsdale, it's well worth the drive and wait!

I rarely give one star; however, this dining experience was one of four bad ones. Having given this a chance over and over, I'm throwing Sushi Roku under the bus.  Three of the four times I've dined here, the drinks came after the food.  The front staff are friendly but some of the staff was down-right rude. I've worked in the service industry for years and cannot believe the attitudes of the servers.  One of the servers lied to us and told us they were out of pitchers because she didn't want to sell $15.00 pitchers.  The manager actually admitted that she lied and there were plenty of pitchers.  She also lied on our tab and took advantage of a large table who would have tipped more than 30% had she been honest and courteous.  The food I would rate, okay.  I find that they don't use the best ingredients and inexpensive soy sauces, etc.    I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone.  If you want bad service in a convenient W Hotel location, go for it, but Roka Akor far surpasses Sushi Roku.

If you want great food, atmosphere and a friendly spot, then The Mission is the place to go.   I happened to stumble upon this intimate restaurant one evening in old town Scottsdale and was so surprised to find this hot spot. It's literally in a old mission and chef Matt Carter from Zinc Bistro serves up great tasting Latin American cuisine. The atmosphere is cozy and the decor is impressive.   I would classify their menu items as more tapa style and it's a little pricey but worth it. I'm a huge fan of their table-side guacamole and their smokey flavored salsa is to die for. The shrimp anticuchos (skewered shrimp) are excellent. I would recommend the tecate skirt steak tacos served on hand made corn tortillas but the pulled-pork is also excellent. The portions are small and if you are used to large, hearty portions, then I would not recommend this place; however, I enjoy more tapa style because you can sample more of their delicious menu items.   Don't forget to check out their extensive tequila selection and their Spanish wine list; the sangria is excellent as well.   I would definitely recommend this quaint spot for any event, date or outing and the staff are friendly and remembered my name the second time I walked in. Everyone is very friendly and it's well worth every penny.

I give Hanny's two thumbs up for being one of the first modern and avante garde restaurants to hit the downtown Phoenix metro area. Hanny's originated from Scottsdale's AZ88 restaurant. The building used to house a men's clothing department store and its very mod but the staff is very friendly, service-oriented and the building has some usually fun architectural finds.   I would recommend for appetizers the bar plate that comes with prosciutto di parma, parmigiano reggiano, melon, green Olives, kalamata olives, pistachio nuts and ciabatta bread. The Quattro pizza topped with a fried egg is amazing and the roast beef sandwich is also good.   They also have great drink specialties and carry ginger beer that is often hard to find. They are open late so it's great for alcohol and appetizers and the bar is very large. They also have an upstairs area for private parties. I definitely recommend this place if you are downtown.

Rude bartenders, staff, servers. Take your drinks before you finish. I can honestly say the servers seem bitter. If you dont want to be here then stay home. So dissapointed. Came here for years but never again.

SideBar is a great urban spot that's not only quaint but friendly and hip.  This place is a best-kept secret and it's as inviting as any neighborhood bar but also very retro.  Old movies play in the background and the friendly bar staff serves up excellent martini's and specialty drinks.  The White Rabbit martini is a favorite of mine and is very similar to that of horchatta. Great deejays perform in this little spot and I love that it attracts a very diverse and friendly Phoenix crowed.  This is definitely a favorite spot of mine and I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates hip local spots.    Sundays are industry night and

Great way to start a Saturday Morning.    Friendly staff and vendors, fresh food with a touch of european flare.    Homeade pizza's, bakery items, crepes, omelet bar, wine/champage station and european and locally made goods vendors.    The only down-side is that it's often difficult to find a table and the lines for the crepe and omelet bar can get too long, but I recommend you go early.   If you appreciate european food, this is a must!

Postino's Central originated from Postino Wine Cafe in Arcadia. This quaint spot is home to many locals of all types and ages.   The environment has a soft ambiance with a more upbeat feel. Diners can choose their own wine from the wine racks or order by the glass. You haven't experienced Postino's until you indulge in their selection of pick and choose bruschettas brought out on a wooden slab. My favorites are the brie & apples with fig spread, the fresh mozzarella with tomato & basil, prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and the warm artichoke spread bruschetta. The panini and soups are also wonderful and they have just started serving brunch on the weekends until 1pm.   Don't miss out on their Monday and Tuesday nights special! For $20.00 it includes one bottle of house wine and a slab of bruschetta.   I would highly recommend this place for a date night, night out with the girls or gathering. Definitely one of my favorite spots in town to sip on wine and take in the scenery while enjoying a mimosa on the patio.

I frequent Lola Coffee on Central and Lux Coffee as well but I was very disappointed in this one. The location is quaint and the building eclectic; I do like the high ceilings but as far as comfort the coffee shops furniture are old school chairs, tables and vintage artist drafting chairs are beyond uncomfortable. Maybe they don't want people staying long but I wouldn't recommend this shop. The coffee is okay and the staff are wonderful unlike the staff at the Central location who barely say a word but I would have to say on a honest opinion, no thank you. I think there is always room for approval but they would need to makes some changes. They also close at 7pm which seems a little early for the city.

This is a "Must Attend" charity event!  Ever been to the Scottsdale Culinary event where every skinny person is afraid to eat in public?  This puts Scottsdale Culinary to shame.  They don't call it Devoured for nothing.  Everyone is friendly and no one is afraid to eat.  It's an all-you-can-eat and drink fest with all of the the local valley restaurants and bars.  Sunday was too busy but Saturday was pleasant!  Don't miss it next year!

This Persian eatery  is yummy! Not only do they have certain persian favorites on various days of the week, they also make their pita's from scratch!  It's tough to find quality middle-eastern food thats fast and this place impressed me.  Their hummus is also very good! I love the barberries and chicken (zereschk pollo) but they also have great pomegranate chicken.  Great for a quick bite to eat, you won't be disappointed if you appreciate middle-eastern food and especially Persian!

Beckett's achieved a neighborhood feel-good joint  that was rustic and casual; however, the high-end service did not meet the expectations of the food.  I found the food lacking in flavor and pizazz.  Comfort food seems to be a fad now-days but for someone watching what they eat, this joint is not for you!  They had some great choices for wine but all three of the entrees we ordered were dull and flavorless.  We ordered the zucchini appetizer which was nothing exciting.  We also ordered a fish entree and short rib entree which lacked major flavor and disappointing to the palate.  We  will only return for the wine in the future.

This place is yummy!  I was very impressed with this thai food eatery.    I love the decor, very mod and chic, great date place.  The tom ka gai soup was excellent.  Salmon dish was great as well and crispy chicken, basil and green beans with chili was good.  Pricing was not bad at all and the presentation of the food was impressive.  I would recommend this place any time!

I was blown away by this place.  I was having trouble finding a place to deliver flowers on Mother's Day and the owner was absolutely amazing!  She spent so much time with me on the phone, the flower arrangement was stunning and she spent so much time and detail on the arrangement.  She not only text me a photo but she hand delivered it herself.  Very impressive and my mother was extatic and it really made her day.  Thank you so much to the owner.  I will never go anywhere else.  The price was very affordable too.  I recommend you ditch 1-800-Flowers and go with All Occasion Floral.

My friends and I have been getting our nails done by Hai for years and were so excited that he's finally opening his own shop.  This nail salon is so nice and they will have a child play area for mother's who need to get their nails done but have children.  Brilliant idea, clean and I've known Hai for a while now and he always put the client first.  I highly recommend this place to anyone.  They will also offer waxing as well!
