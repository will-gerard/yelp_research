The security is awful at this venue. It's like a joy for them to kick people out for no reason. Kids are Paying customers who are out to have a good time. Security is there to control the people who are disrupting the show nothing else.  IF YOU ARE A PROMOTER PLEASE STOP BOOKING SHOWS HERE. The only reason I give it 1 star is because it's a good size and the location is convenient. The sound system is terrible. I cannot wait for them to change management and hire new security staff. I will not be back until they announce new management. I will miss some of my favorite acts this year. Luckily there are other venues in AZ that do have a great attitude towards paying customers who just want to have a good time. The bartenders have been nice and serve good high price drinks. That's ok.

Awesome place to start or continue training. I had an assessment done and my experience was awesome. The trainers are well versed and will adapt to your current condition. If you are interested in starting crossfit then this is the place for you. Good luck!

Best Hamburgers on the west coast.  Usually a long line, but its well worth the wait.  This family owed restaurant is opening new locations throughout the southwest.  From Baldwin Park CA, they are now in Nevada, Arizona, and Texas.  If you live west of the Mississippi they might be opening or opened one in your neck of the woods. Hamburgers are made with the freshest ingredients and are made to order.  Beware of the hidden menu it becomes addicting.  I like the fries extra crispy.  The Milk shakes bring a happy ending to a wonderful meal.  If you are heading through the drive thru and they have a double order lane, pay extra attention who is ahead of you.  Usually the business guy is ordering for more than one.  The same with the pick up truck guy, he might be getting the entire work crew an order.  This is not the lane you want to pick.  Instead opt for the guy in the sedan all bye himself usually single or with a friend type cars are the best option because they know what they want and will get through a lot quicker.  Good luck and the best part is you can write a review while you wait for your meal like I am right now! Cheers!

Three days before my daughters birthday I thought of a custom fondant cake, but who to order it from? I sent out various email request and this place was the first to respond. After a quick quote over the phone they agreed to have it done in two days Wow! I don't know if you've ever ordered a custom cake but 90% Of the time it's at least a  weeks notice. The price was reasonable for the short amount of time. They delivered on time with a cake that was a lot bigger than what we had discussed over the phone. My daughter is a huge Dr Who fan so I ordered a custom cake in the shape of the TARDIS (Google it). It came out awesome looked just like a Tardis. It was a chocolate cake with chocolate moose filing and let me tell you it was a home run in the taste department. We had so much cake left over we gave pieces away to the staff at the restaurant we celebrated and even they loved the tasted. I have to give them 5 stars because of the excellent customer service and the great tasting cake. They really helped make it a special birthday for us. Thank you! I can't wait to go back and try some cupcakes.

Wow! So, these guys (owners) learned how to make sushi from another great sushi restaurant chain in Arizona.  They learned very well and after many years they got together and opened Senor Sushi.  The location might not be glamorous but the food is.  The taste of the food is excellent.  You might not find all of the traditional sushi dishes here but you will find great sushi.  For the most part the menu is a Mexican infused sushi and it is amazing.  Especially if you like spicy food.  The service staff is still learning and with time they should get it together.  Lunch time is the best time to eat here. They have a stage so it might turn into a Mexican fiesta a night with live entertainment.  If are looking for a nice traditional Asian sushi place this might not be the place for dinner.  There is nothing romantic about the restaurant.  The decor does have some Asian influence but the staff screams Mexican restaurant.  The staff overpower the decor, but the great tasting sushi overpowers everything.  I've never ate carne asada sushi (pretty sure thats not sushi) but they say it is.  Give it a try and tell me what you think?  I've heard its good.  Anyway  If you are in the neighborhood give them a try the food is worth it.

I drove past this restaurant and saw people outside waiting. I immediately yelped and found it. The reviews are right on the money. Yes there will be a wait, yes it will be crowded, yes it will be loud and yes the food is amazing and worth all of it. Came here for breakfast on Saturday got in line around 11am got seated right before 12pm. So we ended up have one breakfast dish The Waffle with Bacon and a lunch dish the Butter Burger. There were both delicious. The Waffle is fluffy buttery and fresh the crispy thick cut bacon is salty and balances out the sweetness of the real maple syrup. The butter burger is on point the meat is fresh and cooked to your liking the bun is the icing on the cake it's sweet and tasty. We also had orange juice and when I say orange juice I mean fresh squeezed right into the glass.  It tasted like I had an orange with a straw. The strawberry lemonade was sweet and tangy. The staff was friendly and helpful they took very good care of us. We will definitely be back I hope your enjoy your experience here as much as we did. Thanks for reading. Enjoy!!

Square Slices are for me.  Although this is my first check in to Di Carlo's its not my first time here.  This pizza is amazingly unique because of the unmelted cheese and the warm unbaked toppings. Trust me it works! I love that its not a greasy over spiced type pizza. The best is the flavor of the freshly made sauce.  I could eat the crust and sauce by itself, thats how good it is.  The toppings are really the "cherry on top" so to speak.  The ingredients are fresh and compliment the sauce and crust perfectly.  The crust does not taste like garlic, which in my opinon is a good thing.  It is crunchy but soft enough to fold and eat it New York Style.  I've had many slices of authentic New York pizza, Di Carlo's pizza is in a class all its own. I like that the bread and sauce taste great together. The high quality  fresh ingriendients and pizza sauce made from scratch is what sets Di Carlo's Pizza apart from a Dominos or Pizza Hut.   The price is worth the quality.  I will keep coming back, the only draw back is that they only have one location in Arizona, and none in California.

My first time here and all I can say is make an appointment with Lenny the owner. His attention to detail is second to none. His years of experience have made him a master barber. Your cut will be exceptional just like mine. I especially like his advice on maintaining my cut so it stays looking fresh for weeks. The shop is clean and professional looking. There are some comfy bucket seats just in case there is a small wait. The decor is contemporary, the barber chairs give it a hint of old school. The dedicated flat screens are conveniently placed at eye level, per station. It makes it easy to enjoy a game while getting a cut.  You never know who you will run into at Lenny's. I'm told several professional athletes enjoy Lenny's services while in town for a game. Long wait times on the weekends try to avoid them if you can. If you can't avoid the weekends rest assure the service is worth the wait. Especially the complementary hot towel & shoulder massage after each cut. Tell Lenny Edgar Sent you!

Never again!  This place is a mom and pop fast food catastrophe.  Sushi this is not.  Do not have sushi at this place.  I dont know how this place has survived.  The location must be keeping them alive.  Im sure locals dont eat here.  I am usually a fan of mom and pop restaurants but these people are in desperate need of help.  I am not here to give restaurant advice to restaurants.  I am here to warm people of bad food.  You've been warned Do not eat sushi here it is not good, fresh or worth it.
