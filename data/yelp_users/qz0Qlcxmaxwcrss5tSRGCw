Went here for a team lunch during a workday. Food was decent.. Server was ok.. It took about an hour to get our food though so we were getting hangry by the time we actually got our order. Most likely will not be back.

I've been staying away from junk food for quite awhile but I cave sometimes. I'm at Walmart and decided to get a burger. God is punishing me for it cuz this one is apparently run by apes that don't comprehend as well as normal apes. Dude called my order number and then some other customer complained that he hadn't gotten his yet and so they took mine and threw it away to make the other guys... I watched this take place with my own eyes. WTF???   STAY AWAY!!!  UPDATE: someone there that I think was a shift supervisor or something apparently came in and started taking care of everyone's messed up orders. She was apologetic and gave me coupons for free McDonald's and also offered free french fries on the spot as well as a large drink. I declined the fries and a soda and I gave my coupons to strangers that were getting ready to order. The service here was so terrible that I gave free stuff away because I did not want anything to do with McDonald's! Usually I will bump up my review a star if they make an attempt to rectify... But it was so bad here I can't even do that.

I'm fairly surprised at how many good reviews on this are here. This place was absolutely disgusting! The food was so bland and tasted like it had been sitting for a couple days. We should have known better when we walked in and the owner was sitting there picking his ear! The waitress lady was nice but the food was horrid and we all felt sick afterwards. This place was recommended by a friend and now I have to murder her! STAY AWAY!

This is our go to place for Chinese food. Right in our area and always friendly service. The sesame chicken is awesome! Also you've got to try the pot stickers! They take awhile because they make them fresh but they are the bomb.com!!

My wife and I ate here last night. My dinner was quite good. I had the chicken stuffed with feta and spinach topped with a pesto sauce. Service was ok.. Not great but not terrible. Giving a one star review however because my wife became very ill when we got home and she puked her guts out for a few hours. So yeah.. If you guys can make sure the gyro meat is cooked all the way that would be great.

Went shooting at Ben Avery for the first time a couple weeks ago and it wasn't bad at all! The staff was friendly and the lanes were pretty spacious so we had wiggle room. It was pretty packed so we had to wait about 30 mins to get on. But you're only paying $7 for an ALL DAY pass vs $15 for an hour at the indoor places. Obviously in the summer time I may make a different decision but all around I think this will be my go to range moving forward.

Ordered a pesto chicken pasta. Took 25 mins.. Cost $10.. And I'm still hungry. Portion was small for the price. Won't be back. The pizza is ok but better options in the area for less.

I Googled "24 hour coffee places" and this was one of 3 that came up for the entire valley. It was basically on my commute in so it worked for me. I pulled up to the place and it was well lit and inviting. I walk in and there are 2 employees inside who greeted me. I went to the counter to order my coffee and the lady was very nice. She asked what my name was and I gave it to her. She introduced herself as Amanda and asked if I had ever been there. I said it was my first time and they both thanked me for coming to check them out. I let them know that I probably would only be in about once a month because thats how often my job requires me to work in the middle of the night.   They said they had only been open 24 hours for about a week. I guess its lucky since I was desperate for my fix. My coffee was ready and they hooked me up with a cookie for ciming in to check them out so I thought that was pretty cool. The coffee was pretty good and Im wide awake now as I write this review! All in all it was great personable service (which unfortunately is somewhat rare these days) so I would recommend this place for all your caffeine and baked treat needs!   Oh also they didnt have stir sticks. They had regular tea spoons to stir my coffee as they were trying to be as green as they could so I respected that.   Give UB a chance!

Was going to order a bouquet that seemed kinda small for the price, but it was within my budget so that's what I was gonna go with. Then realized the pics they use for the items are always the large version though the price is for the small version. This seems borderline false advertisement to me. At the least it's certainly deceptive. The small version was unacceptable to me so I chose something else. That was problem #1.    I needed this for my boss at work on a particular day. I also needed it to be ready for pickup when they first opened the shop on that day. I placed the order several days in advance and was told this would be no problem.  I even called the day before to confirm and was told it would be fine.    On the day of, I called at 9 when they opened and was told they were working on it and to give them til 11a. I explained that I needed to come pick this up right now due to meetings all morning and told her I had confirmed TWICE that my order would be ready for pickup. She said she was sorry and it wasn't ready. I said well I guess I have to wait til the afternoon to come get it and I hung up. I was pretty peeved.    Fast forward 30 mins and she calls me back. "I'm sorry but the order was actually ready..I just didn't see it". Are you kidding me?? At that point I didn't have time to drive over to get it so I said I would have to come get it when I had the time.     I go to pick it up finally and there was no apology.. No appreciation.   Bottom line: WAY too expensive for what you get and the service you receive makes it that much more unbearable. I will NEVER purchase an Edible Arrangement again.

Favorite mom n pop coffee shop! The chai tea latte will change your life forever! This is a cool spot for hanging out with friends on a Saturday night while listening to cool local music, but also just as cool on a Tuesday afternoon for just chillin out with some coffee by yourself.

So let me just start by saying I adore my iPod and I use it all day at work..at the gym..while I play video games..taking a shower! I love my iPod! So when I dropped it off the top stairs at the gym and it hit the bottom concrete floor, I almost died! It still worked, but the front cover, back cover and inner LED screen took a pretty nice hit. I dealt with it cuz I didn't have $250.00 to buy another one and it sounded fine..it was just the screen that really was messed up though I could still read the info.   Well this morning I got up and the screen was completely jacked to where I could no longer see anything to navigate the menus. So I talked to my old friend the internet and he guided me to NexTech Repair. I checked the website and figured the cost would be about $100.00. I consulted with my close friend Yelp and was advised these guys are pretty decent so I gave it a whirl.   I walked into the place and its just this kid who happens to be the owner. He checked out my pod and he said it wouldn't be a prob. He gave me a discount because I was getting all 3 main components replaced and the back cover was actually used. He was done in about 20 mins and and it only ended up costing $55.00!!   I would definitely recommend this place to all who are in need!

I only go here to get my haircut by Daniel. He does it right every time and I never have to tell him what I need. Plus he is very friendly and a funny dude. I'm a guy and he really only cuts guys hair but has a female there that does both. Give him a shot!

Really nice staff that know your name when you walk in. Trainers are awesome. The gym itself is super clean and all the equipment is pristine. And yeah.. The workout is legit! Every time I work out here I really feel like I accomplished something. The heart monitors help me push myself when I see that my heart rate isn't where I want it to be.  I really like this place!    The only complaint I have is that I can't use the app to schedule at other locations other than my home gym. I'm an unlimited member so if I have access to any location then it really doesn't make sense why the method of reservation is restricted. Also my results haven't been emailed to me a few times which I've called about before. But both these things are minor in comparison to the benefits.

Came to get a knee brace before my workout.. There's no store here at all. This is an office complex. Thanks Yelp!!

Panera sucks. It was better when it was Paradise Bakery. I like being able to watch them make my food. Since that went away, the service declined. I would like the order kiosks if it had everything that was on the menu. I do t understand why it wouldn't have everything that the menu behind the counter has but it's super irritating. I just got something today because the sole cashier that was working was super slow and I was hungry so I got a different salad than I actually waned simply because it was on the kiosk menu.
