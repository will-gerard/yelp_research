Hmmmm....didn't really impress me when i heard former President Clinton ate here in a whim on one of his trips in PHX. i was more distracted by this eatery being centrally located on a grimey street as well as the odd smell that greeted us in the narrow halls of the waiting area. It surprised me that the odd smell did not deter the number of people who were dining here. There was a brief wait time as this small eatery was packed in every room-including the bar's dining area. There was also a wait for the takeout line which they had conveniently outside...must be something worth yelping about....  So i decided to order what my cousin has been raving about-the chimichangas. I've eaten many a chimichangas before but never...a beef chimichanga... even with its regular guacamole +sour cream combo ever touched  the one i had at Ponchos! Simply stated-the overall meal came fast, FRESH & was filling. Now i understand how certain foods can trigger a massive release of endorphins throughout your body....i stuffed myself enough to put me in a food coma. Now i understand that i could never go back to a 'chain' Mexican restaurant again.   Affordable as is delicious-Ponchos proves that QUALITY of food isn't necessarily determined by price-as some of the best & most authentic cuisines are truly hidden treasures in local neighborhoods waiting to be found...thank you cousin for helping me discover this gem!  The menu may look very typical (http://www.ponchosaz.com/eimenu/) but you'd only know the taste difference if you ate here & experienced it for yourself. Poncho's wont disappoint.

Coming from California you can feel my snub towards desert sushi.  Also while visiting Arizona a while back was the first time I've ever had BAD sushi. BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...  AMBIANCE:  Its interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.)  Located in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.  SUSHI & SERVICE:  I went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO.  -The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces. -If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here.   Though Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.  BRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert! Finally a place for my sushi fix.

I was surprised upon first entering this spot (as recommended by my cousin who raved about this spot when she first moved to AZ) the place wasn't fully packed, a few tables were empty & there were two other couples who came after us which we all waited in the seating area for a good 15-20 minutes. At this point i'm not discouraged because i will wait if i'm anticipating GOOD food so finally, we got seated along with those 2 other parties at the same time.   Another 5 minute wait to look through menu & get drink orders taken. They forgot my coke which was later served the THIRD time our waiter miraculously came around :(. We finally ordered while snacking on the chips which tasted like residual hemp products lol not really my fav-definitely an acquired taste. We simply ordered sheikh kabob, chicken curry, naan & pista kulfi ice cream for desert....so i run to the restroom which was dirty & was disappointed considering even the worst hole in the wall gems i have found have clean public restrooms! Should have been the last red flag for me & ended the experience right there....  ....Another 10 minutes pass by & I'm noticing the tables next to us have already gotten their food....come another ? minutes at this point i'm wondering if my frustrations are psychologically ruining my taste buds or was it from my dehydration from the lack of water refills because in between the two tables who were also seated at the same time if my cousin & i were intentionally being neglected considering most of the tables left & aside from the table who was next to us were the only patrons left in the joint! We are not the type of people who make a peep in public places, as both of us work for the public & for this reason i will always rate my experiences honestly.  Finally as the last table left  we were still getting served our last dish. Mediocre at best. I found a plastic part in my pista kulfi which topped off the list of undesirable dining experiences i've ever had.  Terrible.

Back in 2005 when my relatives ran a business next door i used to come to Aj's specifically for their deserts...i mean their 'boulangerie' counter. Just recently I've come back for more.  Their magic bars have stayed consistent. A magic bar isn't JUST a magic bar ya know-here they make it to my liking. That's all. Worth shopping for the best sweets here which is different than a mass chain grocery store...Beware of the deceptive alternative fruit deserts. Just because it seems like the more 'sensible' choice, don't kid yourself when you're excessivly popping down those yummy fruit tartes 1 after another. I know, I know. Hyperglycemia never tasted so good ;)

As soon as we got to the shopping center (as it seems most of the clubs are located in AZ) i felt a sharp pang of hesitation as i observed a mixture of cowboys/gangsters/old people/ & 'bros' in line. Seeing this hesitation my cousin assures me that there are 4 'rooms:' Hip-hop, country, 80's, & karaoke....WTF?!?  Inside was the size of an AIRPORT TERMINAL-lots & lots of miles to cover while intoxicated! They even took debit card as cover charge, no dress code, had cocktail waitresses serving all types of shots from the likes of liquid cocaine's to liquid marijuana's & liquid (body parts here), cages, mechanical bulls, karaoke, & CHEAP liquor.  So, 'hip-hop' room featured some of the worst top-40 music that played radio as far back as 5 years ago it seems. The patrons of the club made the cages a sight to be seen: BIG chick dancing with an invisible pole, old guy sandwiched with 3 younger girls in another.... The dance floor is filled with older people (men & women alike who's grandchildren would cry upon seeing their dirty dancing,) Phoenix "thugs," & the scattered bro's all around. Naturally, if the music would've been good, it would've been easier to dance so instead we opt for a 'top-off' at the bar first. There was a no-tab policy & therefore had to swipe per-drink instead. Since ALL drinks were less than $4-being from California it was practically an open bar....  Was in the 80's room & saw the best moves from the people who were probably teens in the era. How i love seeing people living the olden days..the layout in the room was quite nostalgic like...stopped in this room for a fill-up at the bar while watching my Cousins friend freak dance to an 80's song with a Gothic Lolita chick HAHA....  Then passed through the karaoke room-had a tall stage of course featuring the person with the most liquid courage while on the way to the country room...this was the biggest room in this 'airport terminal'- had pool tables on one side, mechanical bull in the center across from the large dosy-doe dance floor. Not much to say...just wanted to ride the bull....  Not my kind of vibe-seems like people from Reno would enjoy it here...OUCH ;P  ..... Lets add the 2 stars for the reasonable prices which makes you think in that little corner of your mind that being a cheap drunk in the midst of this madness isn't bad after all-2 shots for $5? Because the truth is-getting drunk off of less than $25 is truly, truly unbeatable.

Not bad for the first gay club i've been to out here in the desert. If you're a lady, the queens take care of you here. Didn't seem to have to wait in line for the bathroom nor really wait for a drink at the bar no matter how crowded it was that night. It seems the cocktail servers walk around with tin buckets of jello shots, manties showcasing the BS West logo & cute hair. Drink chips @ the bar, non-"Scottsdale drink pricing" which was a ++.   As soon as this spot hit max. capacity, we still managed to etch our own spot on the dance floor. Techno music maybe? Not my type of music but with the chill goers here i still managed to get my Roxbury on. Siiike, but it was fun though.

After partying a little bit here & there in the 'valley' & checking out the different scenes don't ask me to party in Scottsdale unless there's a serious show. With that being said, considering the square ally location with bars & clubs being within walking distance you would figure there would be parking in this suburban location. Helllll to the no!! There's a reason why they need a patroler in the parking garage & have valet parking spots opening only around the times when there is absolutely NO street parking to be found. I kid you not-Ive never even had parking issues like that in San Francisco!! I found it like being in a different country with the little transportation carts reminiscent of when I rode a jeepney for transportation in the Philippines. Its like its own little town...  Word of advice for you rolling with some fellas: bouncers here will hate on other fellas & will straight up tell you if you're not 'adhering' to Mysts ridiculous dress code. Meaning if you're a guy & you're not rocking your most lit-up bejeweled corny T-shirt look-it aint dress code. I figured that when they told my cousin to roll his camo pants down & gave him the stink eye- STRIKE 1.   So while cutting the line a GirL Gone wiLd flashed a bouncer (classy!) & there is a minimal dress code requirement for the ladies. i mean...it wasn't even the pretentious high stylistic fashon either :/ Wait..is this considered 'upscale???'-STRIKE 2.  Now the *SIGH* moment came when I saw this place had Go-go dancers. I swear i was in bopper  central. (Pardon me, I must be outgrowing shit.) STRIKE 3.  Take note that this venue gets packed & between the smoke & strobe lights in the air there is no  breathing room till you step into the outdoor space into the 100 degree temperature (ohhh the first world pains, I know, I know.) I guess the people are used to it out here...but now I know better. MEHHHH...With the most overpriced liquor in the valley, predominantly the made-for-club raps & dirty souf music...its just..not...my vibe.  Fore warning-bring cash or you'll end up with a buzz AND a headache if you didn't know they hold $100 MINIMUM on any cards. Dun dun dunnnn. OUT!

i love going to places like this. Its like one of those local spots that is only known through word of mouth.   While in PHX, i went here on a Tuesday night and found there was a decent crowd. We were confused at first because the location is literally housed on a residential street, unmarked. You walk in feeling like your walking to an indie house party (joke!) Anyways, The Lost Leaf is a one story house converted into a bar scene. The 'kitchen' is the bar which consists of beer & wine menu , & the 'living room' is where the live bands plays. Added with some interesting art deco around the joint this place has a relaxed overall vibe.   Though i was outside my element, i enjoyed my time here.

Located downtown Phoenix sandwiched between what i thought was a strip club on the left & a reggaeton club on the right, Bar Smith seemed highly unlikely! I appreciated upon entering Raekwon's ice cream was CANCELING out Daddy Yankee from the right (HA!) Hip hop/old school mash ups on the lower level combined with a different scene of music on the upper level.    With videos playing against the wall with a full bar & DJ, the rooftop scene is what gives the place an edge as compared to other places I've been to out here. I'm hoping they alternate the genres between the upper & lower levels cause it just wouldn't be fair if they only played the corny music on the rooftop! i could definitely see renting out the space for future parties here. Great ambiance.  This place has $5 drinks with fast 'bartender recognition.' The crowd told me that this place is where young professionals come to party with their older coworkers & alot of Phx. locals meet on a saturday night. Also complete with an 'under the stair' dancer (literally), a bathroom attendant that made me feel a strange pang of guilt because it seemed to be a requirement to put soap in peoples hands & a hot dog stand (though not the bacon wrapped ones i love) outside.  As me & my fam. danced the night away with the rest of the Phoenicians i knew that my cousin & best friend would be going back home to California where places like Bar Smith is plentiful...sans the rooftops in the city. But, even though this place would be a typical great frequent in California, Bar Smith holds its own out here in the desert.

I've never been to a marketplace that transforms into a party grounds at night. Very very clean area, very very difficult parking lot parking on a friday night. As soon as the 'after-hours' is in effect, the place requires you to wear a wrist band for 21+. Surrounding areas has Dave & Busters across & a plethora of bars & pseudo cantina's around the marketplace. Best bet is to bar hop when finding a place to chill with your friends...this shall be explored a little later.  Please refer to that corny movie Coyote Ugly to get a true feel of the place. That is all.

I must say they made good use of this former department store. I have only been in the desert for a couple of years & Hannys is that type of spot. The ambience (department store layout with elevators leading to the vintage mirrored bathrooms & the downstairs basement showcasing the killer dolls,)  the prosciutto pizza, GOOD music (i like the selection of their DJ's here for the music they play which isn't everywhere in PHX-gives me energy,) delicious martinis & most importantly the service is always on point. Without a doubt I've noticed the servers are very consistent with carefully serving the martinis that are filled to the brim from spilling on the table. This type of consistency with good service & simple food is dually noted.   I frequent this spot from time to time, whether its packed or not doesn't really make a difference because the service & drinks have always been consistent. For that Hanny's earns its full stars.

Wanted to check out what Arizona's scene was about. I wanted to see a live show, i wanted to hear good music-& that's what i got.  The music was more than i expected it to be so BIG UPS to the DJ for the underground!! This place also had people on the canvas, tables all around & a small dance floor-which actually reminded me of places back home.   It was a pleasure seeing Simple Citizens from LA rocking the stage...full band w/ MC who also has a trumpet player. Crackin.  In addition was their drink SPECIAL. Yes, there was a $10 cover charge for the show-but the bar charged a QUARTER(!) per drink before 11p then $5 drinks thereafter. WOW. Good to know, especially for the next time i come to visit, I'll be sure to hit this place up nice & early. Yet another spot aside from the Lost Leaf that i will be frequenting when I visit The Grand Canyon State again.

The 1 thing i miss about Arizona was the fact that they had TONI & GUY!  For those of you who don't know, we only have 1 Toni & Guy in southern California & why is it unheard of here in the Bay Area?!? i do not know-for it is like the M.A.C. of hair.  The stylists here are typically hip & very flamboyant with their hairstyles + makeup which i liked. What i loved about these salons is that their customer service was consistent at all locations-a greet, offered a beverage during wait time, then you leave with a refreshing hair style.  Though I've had my hair done at multiple Toni & Guy salons around AZ, i liked this one the most. Nevermind the ghetto mall its housed in, i finally found my regular hairstylist + Master stylist (whom i went to when my reg. stylist wasn't there) at this location.  I've had many bad cuts in the past so my hair eventually hit my waist & had no style to it whatsoever. When i finally decided i wanted a change from one length hair that was down to my waist to bangs with choppy layers-i'm glad i decided to make that transformation here. My stylist named Kristin at the time helped me do that even though she didn't want to take all that length off-in the end it was a new look & i always came back to this Toni & Guy once a month.  Depending on what level stylist you request will determine the price you pay-of course its worth it because these people have skills. It seems that most stylists here are more experienced than typical chain salons that hire stylists straight out of cosmetology school. Big plus.

I can appreciate a dive bar but i had mixed feelings about this place. Even so my mission was to go where the music is....  Came on a night one of my fellow 'bay' natives was spinning which was a plus. This place is definitely contrasted by the connected bar. A pool/dive bar/country room (judging by the patrons in it) Seriously?  Maybe this review is totally premature...maybe i shall attend another event....i keep reminding myself its about the music....someone from here convince me otherwise.
