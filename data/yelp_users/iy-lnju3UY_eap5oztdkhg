This was my first time to Rokerij. I was shocked at how packed it was, and after being there and having happy hour there, even more shocked at how packed it stayed throughout the entire evening! Thankfully we got there early enough to find a seat! With that said, it's totally understandable. Their happy hour menu was awesome and decently priced! The staff was super attentive, helpful and on top of their game.

I used to go to Uncle Sam's all the time back in the day! The location on Shea and 32nd is by far the best! I went again last week and sure enough, it did not disappoint!  I always get the regular cheese steak sandwich, and sure enough, it was just as good as I remembered! Enjoy!!

Ladies, you know how hard it is to find an amazing eyebrow waxer! There's no need to search hi and low anymore! Monica is BY FAR the best... EVER! She's been doing this over 20 years or so and she's seriously amazing! I've been going to her about 5-6 years now and I won't go anywhere else!

This place is nothing like the Sakana in Scottsdale. Not in a bad way by any means, but it does seem a little bit more cozy and not as stuffy. Our server was really helpful and had some great suggestions. We ended up trying the a specialty roll of the night and they were both super tasty!  I don't know about you, but I'm not one to try a new sushi place without a recommendation... so consider this as me recommending Sakana to you! :)

Before I comment on why I'm only giving two stars, I'd like to say that pedicures here are more like 3.5 stars. They can make some fun and crazy designs!  However, I got a set of gel nails here and I will likely never make that mistake again.They left fuzzies from the cotton balls on my nails and just painted over it, leaving the nails lumpy. They didn't really smooth anything out, so there were little bubbles and bumps in almost every nail. (This completely irritated me the entire time I had the nails on!) One nail came completely off in less than a week!  Needless to say, I would have given them one star for the nails alone, but they did do a pretty good job on my pedicure. Time to find a new nail place for me!

I recently started taking west coast swing dancing classes at Paragon. Robert, the instructor, is awesome and super patient, even with beginner dancers. It's only $7 for 60-90 mins of lessons. Great place to start getting into dancing!

A friend of mine has been raving about this place for a while now, and with good reason! I was finally able to go here for breakfast over the weekend. While my friends raved about their twist on french toast, I have to admit that wasn't my favorite... I did, however, LOVE their blueberry pancakes! One would think you can get pancakes anywhere, but these were seriously amazing!  While the food was super tasty and worth the higher prices, the way in which to order food seemed to contradict both a little. Overall, super tasty and definitely worth going back to! :)

I lived next to this restaurant for 15 or so years and never went. Even when my mom would ask me to because they prepared food they way her mom did when she was young... nope, that didn't get me to go. Needless to say, I'm not a super big fan of trying new foods that I know nothing about (thankfully, I'm changing on that, bare with me!)  A few years after moving away, I get a new boss at work who's from Cuba. So my work team decided to bring her to Havana Cafe. After so many years of boycotting this restaurant, I was forced to go. THANKFULLY! Who knew Cuban food could be so amazingly delicious! Now that I was "forced" to go once, I've been SO many more times and love it even more every time I go.  The Bistec Encebollado (thinly cut steak with onions on top) paired with Moros (black beans and rice mixed) are my absolute fave! But you can't start the meal without getting the Calypso Chips (warm plantain chips with a cold black bean dip)!  Havana Cafe is now one of my absolute favorite restaurants!

This place was amazing! First of all, it's strategically placed right next to a large pond, which make the views beautiful... especially at sunset time!   We started off with a Mango Mojito, which was absolutely delicious! Not overpowering on the mint or the mango! Very nicely done!  Then, I opted for the Mixed Seafood Grill (grilled citrus salmon, shrimp scampi & a jumbo lump crab cake, served with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes & asparagus). Holy moly! There was so much food but it all tasted so delicious and was so flavorful! My favorite though would definitely have to be the shrimp scampi!  We couldn't end the night without trying their dessert, that they sneakily talk you into when taking your order. The Hot Chocolate Lava Cake takes 30 minutes to make, so you have to order it when you order your food... and let me tell you, it was definitely worth every calorie! Such a yummy, chocolately goodness!  I will say that this place is pretty pricey, so I wouldn't go often. But definitely worth it for a nice evening out! I would definitely go back!

My rating might be a little biased... after all, Bahama Buck's was my first job, so it has a special little place in my heart. But my rating is still right on track because BBs is seriously awesomesauce! Where else can you get a super soft snow (don't even try to compare to a snow cone!)? You can also get a Bahama Rama Mama, where they put ice cream at the bottom on the snow and top it with whipping cream. It's seriously delicious. Thankfully, I've been able to pass my love of BBs onto my nieces and get to frequent often!

Do you like feta or cheve goat cheese? Crow's Dairy makes the beat cheese ever! They also started making gelato that is to die for! While their cheese is used in a lot of restaurants, you can also find them at a ton of farmer's markets. If you see them around, definitely try it!!

If you're looking for a super lounge-y relaxed kind of place, Kazimierz is so the place to go! They have an awesome cheese platter and a million different types of wine to try. It's a very laid back kind of place and the servers are very helpful when trying to decide which wines to try next.  It is kind of dark and pretty loud... but you're in Old Town, it's kind of expected :P

PRG is at the top of my list for climbing! Their staff is always super helpful and they're constantly changing up the walls.   Side note though, if you're a first timer, it's more helpful going with someone who's actually been before to use their tips and knowledge.

This is by far one of my favorite spots to eat when in Vegas! All you can eat seafood and sushi!! I think I died and went to heaven, every time I get to go here. The price is minimal when you think of all the food you get, and believe me, I can eat A LOT of sushi! If you haven't tried this place, you definitely should give it shot, you'll thank me! :)

This was the first time I had gone to Matt's Big Breakfast. I had heard some amazing things about it, outside of the fact that the wait times were horrendous, due to the fact that their original location was SO small. Low and behold, they opened up a second location, more than twice the size of their original one (still pretty small to be honest), so we HAD to try it.   We arrived at 7am on a Saturday morning, thinking we'd have NO issues getting in THAT early. We were wrong. We waited an hour or so... it could have been a longer wait though since our whole party didn't show up til 7:15ish. After the long anticipated wait, we finally ordered! Let me just mention, you really can't substitute or make many changes, if any, to your order. I ordered pancakes and wanted some blueberries, but was told no, lol. Regardless, the pancakes were super delicious! And they came with real maple syrup. Side note... use the syrup sparingly, asking for any extra will cost you an additional $1.50 :P  On another note, I heard their eggs benedict was AMAZING! Sadly, it's only a special and it wasn't on the day I went. I may just have to go again to try it!

This is one of my all time favorite places to go! Who would have thought that mixing Mexican and Chinese food would be a good idea? Definitely not me... at least until you try it!  My usual order: Jade red chicken, cheese quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice... and top it off with their snickerdoodle!  The ordering scheme is a little odd at first, but the workers behind the counter are always willing to help. And if you've never been before, they're always willing to let you try anything first. So yummy and definitely worth the drive to get there!

I recently went to dinner here with a friend. He thought he remembered this place being amazing. Unfortunately, the service was horrible. It took over 20 minutes to just get drinks and another 10 or so to finally order. Once the food got there, it was wrong. We decided to eat it as is anyway and it was just super bland and just not good :( While it was nice trying something new, I don't think I'll return.

This place is extremely different from the one on Guadalupe. It's not in the best area of town and when you go inside, it's kind of like a dungeon. All the windows are covered, it's super dark and almost creepy like. However, don't let that scare you away! Their food is still the best ever! You must try their cajun chicken pasty. Yumyumyum!

Thankfully I had previously purchased a restaurant.com voucher for this place (pay $2 for $25 or something). While the food was alright... nothing spectacular by any means, I thought it was over-priced and really not worth going back to.

Let me first say that I'm no music buff and I'm definitely not a shopper. When I go shopping, I like to go in, get what I need and get out. So when I went into Zia to get my BIL a Christmas gift, I definitely needed some help. All I knew is that he wanted a Blues-y record. I did have a few names to check for but needed help on where to find them. As I walk in, the first thing I do is ask for help. Again, I like to get in and out as quickly as possible, lol. The guy told me that there should be someone back there that could help. Shockingly, no one ever did come to help me :(  I found the record section although was still pretty lost as to what I was trying to find. I didn't know whether I was in the new section or the used. Needless to say, my experience wasn't that great. I was able to find a record... but later found out he already had it! Of course, lol. Zia was really good with exchanging it though, so I'll give them that! :)

This was a super cute little downtown restaurant we stopped by for some happy hour. I would highly suggest the red sangria and the Crispy Risotto Croquettes! And while I didn't actually try it, the bacon grilled cheese looked suuuuper cheesy and delicious! I'd definitely head there again!

My girlfriend and I have been searching for a good pedicure spot, and we both really liked this one. When you walk in it's super inviting and really clean. They have a great setup for manicures and pedicures. Although, don't ask them to just make some cute random design on you toes, they kind of freak out and require to you pick an option, lol. Regardless, it always turns out amazing! Also, you'll want to call and make an appointment though, they're always pretty busy!

I like to think of myself as a connoisseur of pancakes. I've probably tried about every pancake you can think of! And I have to admit, Black Bear's pancakes were pretty freakin' fabulous! Super fluffy with an amazing taste. These are definitely in my top 3.   While the place kind of reminds you of an IHOP or Dennys, don't be fooled. Go in and try them!

Are you one that's too embarrassed to sing karaoke in front of strangers?! Geisha A Go Go could be the place for you! They offer a few rooms that fit 10+ people, so you can invite just those friends that you don't mind embarrassing yourself in front of! So much fun! Some girlfriends and I were able to belt out some awesome tunes this weekend! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars, was because it was $75/hour for the room! Holy moly, I'll pass on those kind of prices! Granted, with that price came a super tasty plate of mixed sushi options. Thankfully my friend had won us a free hour, to sing til our hearts were content, and sing we did! :D

I love this little find, thanks to a friend of mine! While it might not be anything super special compared to another chicken and rice bowl, I do like that they have the option of brown rice and all their veggies aren't just onions.  Overall, a tasty meal with only 500 calories for the small bowl. Sounds good to me! :D

I love rock climbing! However, I still feel like a newbie. The one thing I like about Climb Max is also the one thing I don't like currently, lol. It seems like an extremely advance climbing gym. Since I'm still new-ish to climbing, I find a lot of the climbs a bit too difficult for me... at any other gym, I'd say I climb consistently at a 5.8/5.9 but at this gym, I'm easily at a 5.6/5.7.  Although, when I get better, this place will be amazing. :)

We went to Prado last night for a girlfriend's birthday and I cannot rave more about this place!   Our server, Leah, made our experience so amazing! Not only was she super helpful, she knew just about everything you can imagine about the menu. AND she was totally personable, called us by our names the entire evening. Such a nice added touch!   I got the Branzino and it-was-amazing! So flavorful and the touch of orange was perfect!  It is a little pricey for an everyday kind of meal, but a great place if you're looking for something a little nicer than the usual! :)

Oh man! I have a favorite fast food restaurant in Nebraska called Runza... every time I go there, I have to eat as many as possible. Needless to say, I had my first Cornish Pasty and holy moly, it's seriously a glorified Runza! So amazingly delicious! It's kind of like a calzone only not pizza styled. I had a shepherd's pie in mine and totally worth every calorie! :D

A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious!  They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.  Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment!  Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)

Super cute little joint! I loved Bliss ReBAR's outdoor patio. It was such a perfect evening to sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere. I never did make it inside to see the rest of it, but there were a few short and tall tables on the patio. And now that I think about it, there wasn't all that much seating. They did have a cute little tree bar off to the side that had decent service, the service at the tables weren't all that good though. I was able to try some of the mac-n-cheese... pretty freakin' tasty with a little kick to it. Also, their signature Bliss drink, amazing!!

If you need to park your car when heading out of town and don't want to pay the ridiculous prices at the airport, Blue Sky Airport Parking is definitely the place you should go! The pricing is obviously better at only $7/day and make your reservation and do a pre-pay online, you even save a few more dollars.  You pull in and they direct you where to go, one of the employees follows you in on a golf cart and gives you a ticket at your car and then the shuttle follows him less than a minute later. It's completely direct and is amazing! Quickest service ever!  Once I got home from the airport, it was super easy to find where the shuttle was to be picked up from and again, they dropped you off directly at your vehicle.   I will never park at the airport again! Thanks Blue Sky!! :D

I recall ranting and raving at how amazing this parking place was! How convenient and easy to use and FRIENDLY their service was. I would like to mimic the same sentiment if not more. I cannot say enough amazing things about Blue Sky Airport Parking. I know it's just a parking place... but the customer service is outstanding!   The pricing did go up to $8/day for uncovered parking but it somehow still beats parking at the airport!

I know I've already review Blue Sky Parking a couple times, but after going here EVERY WEEK for the past 10 months, it really deserves to have another amazing review from me! The staff is amazing and super considerate, there are even a couple who know me when I drive up and are super friendly. Their service is definitely top notch and I will never park at the airport again! Thank you Blue Sky for being so awesome!!!

I had never heard of The Arrogant Butcher until last week when some friends and I were trying to decide where to meet for lunch. Needless to say, we chose somewhere else... so when I saw a Meetup group doing a happy hour here, I thought it was the perfect time to try it!  We ended up get the pretzel bread balls and fondue and the hummus. Both were amazing! The hummus was a little spicier than I thought it was going to be, but it was actually quite flavorful.  I kinda wished we stayed for dinner since there was so many things on the menu that sounded delicious. I'd definitely go back and try more!

I went here for the first time a couple weeks ago to go paddle boarding. So much fun! Who knew you could rent paddle boards, boats, kayaks, etc. at the lake?! Lol. I had never been paddle boarding before and the instructor didn't help much... but once I figured it out it was a lot of fun. It was $20/hr, which I thought was kind of pricey but something fun and new to do! :)

I went to Orange Leaf as a well deserved treat after an extremely warm hike. Thanks to someone's Yelp review, I had an excellent experience! Thanks to the Yelper who's name I totally forgot, sorry!  She mentioned they charge by the ounce and to limit how much you actually put in your bowl to make it a little cheaper and to not spend $9+ on a little sweet treat :)  The brownie batter flavor just might be my favorite! It was seriously amazing!!  Great advice, fellow Yelper! And a yummy dessert!

Love love love this idea!  Now, I am no Van Gogh, but it was so fun getting out of your comfort zone and painting a picture... while sipping on a mimosa! The staff is awesome, and they don't expect you to know what you're doing (bonus!). They have a teacher there that walks you thru creating your masterpiece one step at a time. This is an awesome date night event or just to go and have some fun with the girls. Definitely worth trying!

This place was just built walking distance to my house, so I've been dying to check it out. Although, to be honest, I've been to US Eggs before and they were just fine... just a good ol' breakfast place.  After perusing the menu, I noticed that their Protein Pancakes had a star next to them, showing that they were a specialty. Then I noticed that even the t-shirts on the waitstaff mentioned their Protein Pancakes. You know what this means?! I'm SO ordering some Protein Pancakes!  And wowzer, was that a FANTASTIC idea! These things were amazing. There was no protein powdery mix in these! Fresh blueberries, almonds and oatmeal mixed with some pancake mix of sorts. De-lish! Definitely worth the trip just for those babies!

This festival sounded like it was going to be amazing! Unfortunately, it was such a bust! Outside of the parking and entrance fees that literally did nothing but get you into the place, you then had to buy tickets to try samples (literally one bite samples) at $2 each. The lines were ridiculous, well over an hour for most AND most of the trucks had run out of food shortly after it started.   I won't be wasting my time or money on this kind of event again. Sad.

They have a ton of classes to make specific things or just entry classes to give it a try. Definitely something fun to do if you're up for something new to try.

The bruschetta is amazing! They also have an awesome summertime wine that's super delicious and only $5 a glass for happy hour!  The only negative thing, it's typically packed, which leaves you to sit outside. Not so bad since they have misters... but the misters were dripping onto our table. Assuming you can shift around or find a shaded or inside seat, you can't wrong! :)

Oh man! There's so many good things to say about this place... where to begin?!  First of all, did you know that Crepe Bar started as a food truck? Just an interesting side note :)  You might want to get here early, there are always lines and the food takes a little longer than normal to make, so plan on spending 1.5-2 hours here. With that said... it's totally worth the wait! They give you an option to get sweet or savory crepes, all of which will make you drool just reading through the descriptions! I went with their Breakfast Burrito (savory) crepe and would definitely order it again. So delicious!!!  Also, while waiting for the crepes, they started us out with some homemade granola. This may sound odd, but man oh man, it was amazing! So much so, that I asked if it was possible to buy some. Sure enough, they sell a small ish mason jar for $6. And if you bring the jar back, you can get a refill for $3.  I give this place an A++. The staff was super friendly and the food was even more amazing! Definitely give this place a try!

We stopped at Angels Trumpet Ale House on Kerry M.'s birthday. I love the look of this bar! Very open and modern looking, also very hipster-ish. They have an large outdoor patio and don't even get me started on how tasty their pretzels are! What I loved about this place is that they have ~40 beers on tap and when one is empty, they add something completely new and then update the 2 chalkboards. It leaves you wanting to know what's gonna be tapped next. Love it!

Who doesn't love going to the fair to eat some fair food?! For whatever reason, fair food really is only good at the fair, with the atmosphere.  The food was pretty much what you'd expect at the fair. However, the prices seemed about the same if not a little higher, which I guess I didn't expect. Considering this place was in, what seemed like, a garage. They kept the doors open and had heaters scattered around.  I went with a group of 8 people and none of us had been there before. Some nice guy told us to sit wherever we wanted, so we did. However, we waited about 15-20 mins before someone came and told us we had to go up to the counter to order. Not a fun way to start your night. Once we finally ordered, they gave us pagers but didn't tell us where to pick up our food. It was really kind of a nightmare.  Definitely not a place I'm likely to go back to. I'll just wait for the fair to get here and go get my fair food there.

Good luck on trying to find this little gem! It's definitely not an easy find, but if you're one of the lucky ones who do find it, you know just how delicious it is!  I'm not a huge ramen eater, so when my friends suggested we try this little place, let's just say that I wasn't super thrilled. But I like hanging out with friends and will try just about anything, so figured why not. And boy am I glad I did.  While the ramen bowls start at $8 and you have to pay additionally for each topping, it doesn't make it the cheapest meal. (My thoughts on this is more or less for college kids, since it's on Mill...). However, with that said, my $11 meal here, was totally worth it and suuuuuper delicious! So much so, that I'd even enjoy going back!

If you haven't been to the Angry Crab yet, and you enjoy seafood... you.are.missing.out. Some friends and I headed over here for my birthday this year and it was fantastic! Don't think this is any ordinary seafood joint... you're gonna have to get down and dirty to enjoy your food, as no utensils are given to you. Somehow, it makes it that much more of an experience! I would highly recommend the crab legs and the shrimp! YUM!

THANK YOU CHASE for introducing me to Ike's sandwiches!!! This place is seriously amazing! I don't even know the words to describe it's awesomeness. I'm sorry to say that it took me a good couple of months to finally go try a sandwich here once Chase suggested that I try it. I figured it was just another regular sandwich place like Subway, Quiznos or Jimmy John's... however, this is anything but like those places! There are hundreds of different sandwiches to choose from, it's almost overwhelming to take in.   It was seriously SO AMAZING, that I went twice in one day!  I don't know how else to say this, but Ike's sandwiches surpass any sandwich I've ever had. When you go, you NEED to try the Menage a Trois sandwich. The description didn't blow me away... but once you taste it, oh.my.goodness!!! AMAZING! Thanks again Chase, Ike's is now a favorite! I can't wait for the Tempe location to open! :D:D
