Pita Jungle is the bomb!! The Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus is awesome. It has great flavor and not to much heat.

Poor customer service. Three people in the store, two employees working on packages and one standing at the counter doing nothing. The one at the counter asked me how she could help me. I asked my question about the package I was picking up and she said it wasn't there. I explained it was coming from another FedEx store, she looked under the counter and again said it wasn't there. I explained it was supposed to be there at noon (an hour and a half ago). Nope... not hear yet. I would have expected her to say... Let me check on that for you. What store did you place the order with? Nope... I had to sit there and look up the other stores number and then make the call right in front of her. I guess picking up the phone wasn't in her daily job duties... nor was exceptional customer service explained to her either. This is the exactly the reason why UPS will always be a better company than FedEX.

Started off with the pretzels and cheese and fritters. Both were great! Then for the main course I had the turkey sloppy joe which consisted of ground turkey, pablano pepper and pepperjack cheese on a homemade bun... Amazing! And I topped that off with the blueberry cheesecake for dessert (YUM!!!). Overall great food and a very good experience.

Went to Barrio Queen for dinner with my wife and son. We started off with chips and salsa. The chips looked to be homemade and the salsa was a smoked chipotle style (flavorful but not spicy) and was very good. My son ordered the California Enchilada with Pork, my wife ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and I ordered the Azteca Burrito. We also ordered a side of Chipotle Mashed Potatoes. All the food was very flavorful and very good. No complaints about the food at all. Our waitress was also very prompt and refilled our drinks often and the other servers also assisted when needed. The price of the dishes was a little high but the portions were large and filling. Overall I give the place 5 stars and will definitely be back.

Nice local (to Vintage Ranch) breakfast / lunch restaurant. I had "The Kitchen Sink" omelet which was loaded with ham, sausage and bacon. Came with toast and fresh cut potatoes too. A lot of food and tasted great! Looking forward to checking out some other breakfast dishes soon.
