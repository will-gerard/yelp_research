Oh dear god, I'm in love...  Peppered Filet and Martini Scallop dreams fill my mind. Blue Cheese stuffed olives in my martini?? what?? shut the fuck UP!! Sooooo amazing. Quality all the way. I had a glass of Byron Pinot Noir (fabulous) then a white chocolate martini for desert. (I prefer to drink my desert). Great romantic spot to bring a date. Secures that you will be getting action later, trust me.   If you see me at Cheuvront stop by and say hello. I'll be the one in the corner making sweet love to the macaroni and cheese..... no joke.

Seriously... everyone wanting to blow Chris Bianco is a little annoying, however, i must say, the sammies are pretty damn good. On my first visit (ya, I was shocked they were open too) I had the tuna. My decision was based on a review I read. We all have different taste so no harm, no foul..I wasn't terribly impressed. Since I'm a die hard Lux fanatic and I live so close I was more than willing to give it another shot.  One word : soppressata   One more word: WOW  soooooo damn good and it literally filled me up in the best best way. Created a nice "lining" for my tummy so I could down some brews by the pool all day and still get in to work on time the following morning.  I love you Pane. So Chris B.... a little road head??  whatdoya say??

Soppressata... you are my mistress.... your creamy texture, the saltiness of your flesh, I must have you every day. Know that if we are found out I will call you a whore, for it is not my fault that I yearn for you.

Loves it!  Nothing like the eery feeling that you might get raped in the parking lot to make a girl come back for more..... and that is precisely what I do.   Its super close to home for one thing...walkable.  The food is actually pretty phenom. for "bar food" . Oddly they serve a chicken satay in some sort of peanut saucy fabulousness that is pretty damn amazing. The pool tables suck, but hey, I suck at pool, we're even. Where else can you get hammered for 20.00 while wearing pajama bottoms and not feel the least bit out of place.  If you can get past the creepers that haven't been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies.

eh.... it's ok.  I think I was looking for something a little more chill divey and not so sports divey. It was a little brighter inside than I expected and as I said it seemed more like a trashy sports bar than a trashy divey joint which was a pretty immediate turnoff.   The pour was okay, I've had better elsewhere for the same price. There was a slightly noticeable odor of ass in the air and it was freeeeeezing at the bar. Hello people, the temperature is dropping, it's no longer 115 degrees outside, do ya think you can raise the thermostat above 70??? Thanks.   Not horrible but I doubt I'll be back.

I'm the girly girly-ist tom boy you'll ever meet. Sitting through an hour of getting my nails done is pure hell to me. Pedicures are not "relaxation time" for me, it's "pain in the ass time".  I hate getting my hair done and I can't stand shopping. I'd rather be out drinking whiskey and shooting pool. All of this is very difficult for me you understand, because at the same time I like to be pretty. This is where DV comes in to save the day (or at least my hands and feet)    Le is my nail tech. I ONLY go to her though I can say I've had pedi's from some of the other ladies and they're all quite thorough. I'm insanely picky about my nails. It borders on OCD (no joke). Le is extremely detail oriented and my nails turn out perfect every time. It's always packed in there and that is a testament to quality of product if you ask me. The prices are comparable to anywhere else you might go though I don't recommend going anywhere else. It's close to home and afterward I can make a quick run over to Old Navy (one of the few places I can stomach shopping)  It's still a pain in the ass.... the whole damn thing... but at least my fingers and toes look cute. (god, that was the most stupid "chick" thing that has ever come out of my mouth)  I'm glad I could share it with you.

Nothing like sitting here on my lunch break, texting bitches, Julie molesting my feet in the best way....  maybe I'm a girl after all...maybe even the kind of girl that likes other girls...I wonder if Julie's available for private parties.. oh, and my toes are beautiful!

I had a wonderful experience here. I needed a new pair of running shoes badly. I am in the process of getting back into it after taking way too much time off...... (like 3 years)  I know, pathedic. Sometimes liquor and sluts take precedence; don't judge. Anyway, I decided to do this on my lunch break and I was out in about 45 minutes with the most comfortable running shoes I've ever owned.   As stated in previous reviews, the staff is extremely friendly and they know their stuff. The structure of my feet were looked at as well as how I walk. I have never been fitted for running shoes before so it was kind of strange but I knew what to expect. I found out my calves are extremely tight and if I don't start streaching more/better, I'll end up with repetitive motion injuries.... good to know!   I was presented with 3 different pairs of shoes to try out and in those found the perfect pair. I felt like an ass running around out front with the diferent shoes on in business attire but whatever... I found a great pair of runners so I'm happy.   All in all it was an interesting experience. I will be back to pick up some more gear as soon as I feel truely committed again. Not once did I feel pressure to spend money or make a quick decision. As a matter of fact price was never even mentioned until I picked the shoes I wanted. Of course my feet have champagne taste so they chose the most expensive pair.  Bastards

This place is sexy...... woh. This is a review of the downstairs loungey sexy area, not the regular dining area. Is there a regular dining area? huh... don't remember seeing it.  Anyway, the "small plates" menu is divine like jesus. I'm not kidding. The Beef Tenderloin Toasts were as much of a religious experience as I'll allow myself to have. The Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa *blush* caused me to mush mouth the words "ohhhh muhhh gawww" while I was still chewing my food. I don't do that. Ever. It's just nasty. The Blue Crab Tostadas were light and refreshing, the perfect compliment to the rich tenderloin. The wine... let's just say I like me some wine.   The only complaint I have is that the bartender needed a trim. Seriously... his hipster do was getting in his line of vision and anytime we needed anything I had to flash him to get his attention. Okay, not really but you get the point.   In closing: This place will make you forget what you were fighting about. Trust me on that. :) The end

Things I learned last night:  I love unpretentious yet quality service, in a relaxed atmosphere. (she was awesome) I don't like drinking ice water without a straw...yeah yeah, turn your nose up. (work on that)  You can split a bottle of wine between 5 people. (please don't ever make me do that again) I have a new crush. (restaurants without windows)  Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers. Both delicious; the sauce served with the Calamari tastes distinctively like Pei-Wei's sweet and sour, though that's not a bad thing. Desert was "Death by Chocolate". I had one bite. One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.  All in all a great dining experience. I will be back. Many....many times. They also happen to serve the full Richardson's menu, just the way I remember it. That made the whole table happy although the following is what seals the deal for me:  * Sorry we do not provide high chairs or booster seats *  yes, it's love.... without the constant arguing :)

My favorite yelp event next to the Science Center event last year....and quite the opposite.  Very intimate feel, the whole dining area was opened up to make room for us and we were offered a cocktail/glass of wine upon entering. (Nice touch, makes me feel like I'm entering a "Real Housewives of the Depths of Hell" mansion party and I LOVED IT)   The wine was flowing and the food was fantastic! My better half and I enjoyed Crab Cake Sliders, Mini Tenderloin Sandwiches, JUMBO shrimp cocktail and wayyyyyyy to many little Coconut Cream pies. Those little pie babies were like heroin...and not that nasty black tar shit either, the good stuff.   It was nice to see the sweet as pie Gabi M., looking absolutely smashing for just having a baby by the way. Actually, she looked like a person that didn't just have a baby so kudos woman!!  The staff and service was outstanding. We had quite a few conversations with the staff  and Sommelier regarding the wine menu and events and they were all knowledgeable and incredibly polite without being obnoxiously formal. It appears that they have a good read on their clientele and that's a plus in my book. All class, no sass. This experience will definitely bring us back to The Capital Grille for drinks, lunch or dinner.   Had a blast  and I look forward to the next event!

Ok, so I've just come to the conclusion that it's not me....... it's YOU.  I just don't like other peoples used, worn, busted up shit. That said, I really like My Sisters Closet. I've only been in a couple of times but I know potential when I see it in the form of a $400 Louis Vuitton bag. ( I wouldn't purchase it but I liked that it was there) I did pick up a pair of designer (not sure which one, don't really care) sunglasses for $14. Sure, they are probably *gasp* "last season's" or whatever but I don't care. They look hot and they cover almost my entire face which is something I look for in shades.  I will be back soon to see what other goodies I can find. That $400 Louis really made me nervous though. Who has so much dough that they can just drop a perfectly good $1200 bag at consignment??........ and are they interested in adopting or marrying me...

Last Saturday night I got my skate on....   (Before going out to indulge in more "adult" good times)  I had a fucking blast and have decided that next time I go, EVERYONE I know is going with me.  YES, that means YOU!  My date picked me up around 9ish and immediately made reference to the size of my "huevos" for wearing a "red rag" into the 623. (Like anyone's going to believe a 32 yr old white girl at a skating rink is a gang banger). He was joking obviously.... called me 2Pac all night...it was cute, whatever. Upon arrival I noticed that indeed, it is pretty street in there. No biggie, I grew up in Tucson where our skate rink was filled with cholos and meth heads. I don't judge, I high five.  One thing was annoying... .75cents for a locker, and only half of them worked. The .75 thing didn't bother me, the fact that they weren't marked so you just kept throwing more quarters in there and hoping for the best, did.  We strapped on our skates and took off. I haven't been in many years so it took me a few minutes to get comfortable. I can proudly say that I only fell once and it wasn't my fault..... what I can not proudly say is that I ended up on top of a 13yr old boy ...and from the very loud "OWWWUCH" that came out of him I'm pretty sure I punched him in the balls. The look on his face was sheer horror. (I still can't stop laughing about it).  My date was pretty fancy on his feet..... I half expected people to profess undying love to him and call out his name as we left. (one dood kinda did)  All in all, one of the most fun filled evenings that I've had in a long time. Kudos Great Skate!!

I bought my new bike, "Rupert" here fairly recently ( I name inanimate objects...sorry) along with some accessories. I showed up about a half an hour before close and when I mentioned it the guy said "no worries, take your time". I already had a pretty good idea of what I was looking for, a fairly basic commuter / hybrid that I could still take on some pretty decent "distance" rides.   I never felt rushed to choose. He brought out a couple of different cycles for me to test ride. I even tried out a cruiser that I knew I wasn't going to purchase, just for fun. Once I settled on what I wanted the rest was quick and painless. He even helped me load the damn thing into my vehicle without asking if I needed help. (I did) *mental note... purchase a trunk rack*    I came in about a week or so later to buy some lights and he remembered me and even gave me a discount because I had made the purchase such a short time prior. I will certainly continue to give Landis my business.....and I will certainly continue to give names to objects.  Very good experience.

I'm a huge fan of most ***bertos type joints. I occasionally enjoy having lard drip down my chin after biting into a questionable beef taco...       NOT HERE.   The oil very obviously hadn't been replaced in who knows how long. It was pure sickness. I am not a picky eater by any stretch. Growing up with little $ has it's perks in that way. Something has to have zero redeeming qualities for me to not just eat it anyway.  I usually love fish tacos at places like this but these were fucking awful, not crispy, sauce tasted like straight mayo tacos from Hades.      blech! I won't return. I'm taking a long break from any ***bertos as well after this experience. My heart and cholesterol levels thank you Eribertos.

Yum!! I love Frasher's. I love that there has always been speculation amongst my friends as to how to pronounce it. (it's not rocket science people) I love that the place is often full of strippers (who doesn't like strippers) and I love love love the food.   They used to have this shrimp salad that was amazing. I haven't seen it on the menu for quite some time but every time I went I ordered this salad. This was back in my pseudo vegetarian days when the only meat I consumed was of the fish/ shellfish variety. Now that I'm fully obsessed with suicide by red meat I opt for the Filet. The Toasted Ravioli and Stuffed Mushroom Caps are also a favorite, especially if I'm more there to get my buzz on than eat a full meal.   All in all I've had nothing but good experiences at Frasher's. Even if my meal didn't come with a lap dance... I can always just run across the street for that nonsense.   P.S. Bring back the shrimp salad.

Delicious vegan junk food! I am not vegan. I will never be vegan, but I will throw down with the best of them at Green.  There are so many delicious treats on their menu I'm not even going to bother naming off the things I've tried here. Just go, eat everything, and when you gain ten pounds don't come crying to me.  'But Kristi, aren't vegan dishes supposed to be healthy?' ummmm NO!  If I wanted healthy, I'd poach a chicken breast and eat it with some dry salad and brown rice. Maybe slit my wrists and hop into a nice warm bath for dessert. I come here for fake meat that tastes like angel tears. The only thing they're missing is a liquor license.   Located in a strip mall, this place is full of Bieber-esque lesbians and 10 day neck beards just as you would imagine. I don't fit in but when exactly has that ever bothered me? There is even what appears to be a (very tiny) vegan market of sorts inside if you find yourself in desperate need of some Dayia or faux marshmallow fluff. You know, true diet staples. The register area is full of mouth watering vegan desserts that will make you say 'I didn't know you could do THAT with raw cashews!' Man, I love this place...  I haven't heard any news lately about the supposed 'new location' but I really hope that is still in the works as it is much closer to home. I can see myself picking up 3 orders of wings to eat in the privacy of my own abode while watching some god awful Lifetime movies on a Sunday. Bring it on Green.  nom nom nom

Eh, not a fan. I'm actually surprised by the majority of the reviews I've read.   I'm going to preface this by admitting that we decided to stop here after spending most of the afternoon at Papago playing darts and dodging meth heads. Lot's and lot's of beer was involved but trust me when I say that alcohol in no way impairs my judgment when it comes to quality food. If anything I'd say I tend to be more forgiving.  The decor is dated and kitschy. I'm all for quirky and authentic when dining...I can even appreciate sketchy if it's done right. This was more on par with a typical chain Italian place complete with cheesy piped 'That's Amore'  type music. The server struggled a bit to open the bottle of wine (I was NOT DRIVING MOM) and never smiled. The service wasn't awful by any means, just awkward and a little funeral-esque.   The food was okay. Not terrible but nothing standout. The salads were boring and dressed very heavily as if they were ashamed themselves of how boring they were..... 'if I close my eyes and shroud myself in ranch dressing maybe you can't see how uninspired I am.'  meh..  My entree (veal maybe? crap, I can't remember) was a little tough, pretty bland and flavorless. My dates pasta dish looked decent but I didn't try it so I can't really comment. I believe he said 'it's good' with the side to side head bob. Coming from him, I translate that as unimpressed, so there you go. The fried zucchini was just that. Reminiscent of my chain steakhouse server days.  Yes, it was fresh and not frozen but that is hardly a big deal. Let's be honest, the ONLY place that should be serving frozen zucchini better also have a fucking drive through and as we've already established, ranch dressing is the devil's concealer, masking any imperfections so ya.... who knows if it was any good.   All in all a pretty mediocre experience. I'm officially on the lookout for tasty Italian as Lo Cascio didn't really satisfy. Maybe next time.

4.5 stars. I'm not a member of the 'clean plate club' but I was jumped in last night and I have the food baby to prove it. Delicious southern Mexico style cuisine that yes, will put a minor ding in your wallet if you choose to enjoy a couple of perfectly crafted margaritas with your dinner. It's worth it, trust me. Take note of the extensive Tequila list.  Guess what!? It's not Sonoran people and if you're looking for deep fried chimichangas the size of your arm, smothered in oily sauce and a pound of cheese for $7.99 you're in the wrong place. Hey, I love Sonoran Mexican food. I had the pleasure of working in one of the best damn Son restaurants in Tucson in my late teens. I have a fucking green corn tamale where my cold black heart should be ok..... My point is I'm not hating, just don't be a tool. Do some basic research on a place before you decide to grace it with your presence. There's this thing called the internet, you can check out many a restaurants FULL MENU from it, including prices...and if you get bored doing that there's always porn! Hey now!  Moving on.. We shared the Cochinita Pibil - Slow roasted pork with achiote rojo& sour orange. It was melt in your mouth amazing served with perfectly tender corn tortillas to wrap the whole mess up in. I will have dreams about this pork, no joke. We also shared the Chilies en Nogada - Roasted poblano pepper stuffed with chicken, onions, garlic, pecans, apples, pears (yes, I'm still listing) and apricots finished with almond sauce and pom seeds. Ohhhhh, sweet lady guadalupe, if this wasn't an immaculate conception in my mouth I don't know what is. Expectations - met/exceeded.  I did find it slightly odd that dessert wasn't 'sold' to us a bit more as we were only offered just that....dessert. What? No visuals? Bummer, because our inner fat kids would've taken over at that point and we wouldn't have had to stop at Culvers on the way home.... just sayin.

Oh Lux,  how I love thee.... I'll start by stating the obvious, the coffee/espresso  is superb. It's within walking distance from my place which is also fab. My favorite little treat is the velvet (which it seems, is some white chocolate concoction). I always feel like I want to throw up about 20 minutes after finishing it... this is a good thing kids, means it's like diesel fuel (or blow)  and I'll have uncontrollable facial twitching for hours without the cost of either. woot!  Another thing I must mention is the adorable inked up little hipster cat behind the bar. This kid can froth my milk anytime. Sure, I probably couldn't fit into his "skinny" jeans or whatever but still..... rawr.    So if you're like me and you have a penchant for amazingly yummy java and pretty, possibly sexually confused, skinny boys that are WAY to young for you, pop in to Lux.  You can thank me later......

This place was a nightmare for me. I understand that there are people that love love love to do weird shit like hit the stores at 5am the day after Thanksgiving to do their x-mas shopping, punch other people in the face and threaten their lives for that "last fucking furby", and shop at Last Chance.... I'm just not one of them.   I'm not saying I'm better than you....... oh, who am I kidding, yes I am.

Okay, so I'm an undercover fattie. I admit it. I'm ever so thankful to my parents for a kickass metabolism because dammit I love to eat and drink and drink some more....roll around in gelato occasionally; you know, the usual.  I'm not much of a "sweets" eater but this place is in pretty regular rotation. My absolute favorite is the very simple combo of chocolate and peanut butter. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  The location is great. I do my grocery shopping at Safeway and then hit the G-Spot on the way out. They offer a ton of other desert options as well including tiramisu , lemoncello, the list goes on.  Even just writing this makes me feel like I need to go for a run. Stay down fattie...stay down.

I took my friend to Cibo for his birthday a couple of weeks ago. He had been before and I had not (so I guess he kinda took me).   I ordered the Rustica Bianco Pizza and i believe he ordered the Diavola add basil. The food was delish however my Rustica had so much arugula on it it looked like a salad on top of my pizza. I'm talking a VERY unnecessary amount.... whatever, I just removed 3/4 of it. We had almost finished our first bottle of Pinot Noir before being seated so we had another along with dinner; it was a great compliment to the food. It was a Friday night and the wait wasn't more than 45 minutes, not bad in comparison to Bianco. All in all we had a quality experience.  The bar seating is very "close quarters" and if you're like me and you don't like strangers sitting in your lap I recommend imbibing someplace else.

Dayum!!  I can't believe it's taken me so long to review this place. FEZ was the first spot I checked out for drinks and eats when I moved to Central Phoenix. This was before I was a yelping fool and when I used the site in a much more voyeuristic way. (basically to find yummy places in my new hood). After reading many reviews I decided on FEZ for happy hour and dragged this douchetard I was dating for a hot minute, along with me.   The food was fantastic, I believe we had the shrimp kisra and lettuce wraps. My ass clown date kept insisting that the waiter was "coming on to him", at which time I assured him that he wasn't that hot and that gay boys have better taste than I do, so to chill the fuck out. He finally shut up, I enjoyed my wine and food stuff, and clipped his ass 2 days later. (no joke)  I thank FEZ for this defining moment.    I've been back too many times since to even tell you. I work on Central and Thomas and live on Central and Campbell so let's just say I have hummus coming out of my pores at this point. This brings me to my last visit...... today!  I ordered the fez burger to go and substituted rosemary/garlic fries for the salad. I was slightly hungover from a good nite-o-drinkin at the Clarendon roof top bar (that's a whole other review) so I was pretty desperate for some grease. I hadn't had a burger here before and today seemed like the perfect day. Fuck..... it was amazing. I was a little frightened when I ordered it because I'm usually not a fan of mixing fruit and meat....of ANY kind....EVER. Wow, was I surprised. It was delish!! I devoured it at home, in front of my cat, who by the way looked very jealous.. if not completely pissed off at me.   The plan now is to go home and finish that baby off before round two tonight. At this rate I may be in tomorrow for some more hangover food. At this rate I may also gain 100lbs and need an AA meeting or 5. I love you metabolism ...... but  FEZ, I love YOU more.   P.S. I am a little "breathy" after those fries..... No random makeouts tonight, sheesh! That is all.

So I ventured out last evening to try something new with a favorite boy of mine and based on the reviews I read, we decided on Grand Avenue Tavern.  It did not disappoint!!  The drinks were good and strong (like I like) and reasonably priced. The bar is actually quite cozy in a "really nice east coast basement bar" kinda way. It seemed to be a fairly mellow night, everyone enjoying themselves.   The one thing that really put a smile on my face was that we went out front to smoke...... (yes, I smoke when I drink sometimes and I don't wanna hear shit about it, okay mom....) and the owner, Renee came out, introduced herself to us and kinda took us on a little tour of the place. (patio etc.)  She was extremely gracious and sweet and you could tell she really put her all into this bar. (plus, I'm sure with how nice this place is on the inside she didn't want us standing out front smokin' our stogies like a couple of hood rats).  Based on my first experience, I will be back. Probably alot. Maybe every night. So if you see me in there come say hi... say hi to the owner too, awesome lady.

Everyone at Shady's is mean...... and I mean EVERYONE.  They can all suck a fat one though because I'll  keep coming back. (as if to rub my sugar and spice in their bitter angry faces)   I did come across one very cool bartender gal (the one with the Bettie bangs)....but fuck it, I'm not there for the company, I brought my own. The drinks are strong and cheap and I will agree with everyone on the music selection being pretty rad. It's pretty close to my place, it has an interesting smell, it has no windows... all good things for getting plowed mid afternoon on a Tuesday. It's just those damn patrons.   The last few times I've been I've had "near altercation" experiences with some ridiculously intoxicated people (boys and girls). I was making fun of how cool they think they are in my head....it was like they could read my mind or something. Creepy....  I have never seen so many people in one building try so hard to be "weird". Stop trying so hard. You are prematurely aging me with your presence.   Blah.... whatever... I'll be back. One HUGE plus.... Stella on tap yo  UPDATE:: Okay, I was at Shady's last Sat night and last night.... and I might go back tonight. THAT is how good of a time I had. Granted, I was with one of my fav peeps....  That said,  there is no shortage of attention (and pretty young tattooed things)  and for this I am thankful.... I WUV you Shady's  *blush*  UP-UPDATE:  okay... the dood at the door carded my gf and didn't card me...I'm like "WTF??"   he said (and I quote) "you're in here all the time"  nuff said!  oh ya!

Maybe this will be better:  The food was gross period. IN MY OPINION (that's for the owner)  and the beef tacos tasted like what I would imagine dog food would taste like. Wet, nasty .99 cent dog food. It was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, the service was snarky and bitchy and on a Saturday night it was DEAD. *shocking*. I see a lot more nights like that in your future Ticoz. This place will never see another dime of my money.   So sue me.  :)

You can't point fingers and blame others when clearly inferior product (In my opinion) is the problem. I have no ill will toward any establishment. If you want good reviews, provide quality ingredients and good service. It's that simple. If this much effort was put into creating a positive dining experience, I wouldn't have written such a negative review in the first place.   Now go away.

The Roosevelt is s-e-x-y, sexy. I can not believe it's taken me this long to write a review of a spot I tend to frequent but after spending, geeez, I dunno, maybe 4 hours here on Saturday night I was just smitten enough to sing full praises.   Historic home turned bar, The Roosevelt is dark, romantic and the perfect place to spend hours drinking wine, (by the glass or bottle) or beer (from their fairly extensive beer menu) while getting to know that special someone... or, stop in for a nightcap after dinner or a night out downtown.  The Roosevelt offers small plates that are all quite tasty, my favorite being the Bacon wrapped Dates. I love turning people on the wonderful world of dates, and bacon and cheese is the best way to do that.   The setup, as mentioned in previous reviews, is awkward. But hey, this was a home that has been converted to a bar and you are sitting in one of the three bedrooms. I'm not really sure how else it could be done without knocking out walls and ruining some of the sexiness....don't do that...  I'm a smitten kitten Roosevelt, dare I say, full of smit!

I love The Vig. I've been on so many first dates at this place I've often worried that the staff was going to think I was receiving compensation for my...ahem.. "services". It's just easy, (unlike myself) truth be told, most of those first dates were last ones as well. :)  The food is decent. Flatbread Pizza with Tandoori Chicken seems to be my meal of choice. It's quite good, even with my aversion to mixing fruit and meat. Half price bottles of wine on Sundays!! ... I really don't even need to continue the review at this point, but I will.  The only things I don't like about The Vig are : (1)  the polished concrete floors. I've slipped and fallen (sober mind you) on more than one occasion. Yes, I wear 5" heels just about everywhere I go. So yes, partially my fault. (2) Men old enough to be my father coming on to me like they think I don't see the tack marks behind their ears from their nasty face lifts. It grosses me out. I can handle the young DB's, these guys make my skin crawl. If I'm avoiding eye contact with you or have a constipated look on my face this is NOT game on buddy...mmmkay   I have few other complaints. Good music, interesting crowd, love the forced valet so I don't have to end any of those first dates awkwardly hovering at my car door like a 16 year old. Sweet deal if you ask me!

The following is an open letter to the Jon Favreau lookalike DB at The Vig on Saturday:  Jon,   What about me sitting quietly, enjoying a glass of wine with my girlfriend led you to believe that I wanted to do shots with you from a beer bong that you fashioned from a plastic pink flamingo.  No really, what was it.... maybe I need a makeover.   Full of piss and vinegar yet respectfully yours,  Kristi  (I will never go here without a boy in tow again)  I still love you Vig!

I really like the Lost Leaf. Despite the semi-typical "try hard" crowd of a lot of down town Phoenix bars. The last time I was in, my friend and I ride up and are approached  by some too cool for school hipster guy that was obsessed with my buddy's fixie ride.       Whateva.... I have a sweet little bell and the ability to coast bitch.   Anyway, my review of the bar itself echo's most of the others. I love the interior, I love sitting on the stump on the porch to enjoy my beer / wine fueled stogie smoking. I only wish I could bring my drink out with me.  At times the service has left a bit to be desired but in their defense they do get busy (and then there's that whole too cool for school thing that sometimes transcends into the employees ;).   At any rate it's a primarily enjoyable place with a good atmosphere and an awesome beer selection. BYOC *bring your own company* and you should be just fine.

I'm adding a star to my original review for a couple of reasons.   #1) I'm totally falling for this place. The last few times I've been in I've recieved a LOT less attitude from the bar staff. Crappy attitudes don't bother me too much to begin with. I figure that the person in question either has an overinflated ego (because it takes a pretty high skill level to open beer and poor wine) or they're PMS'ing....whatever. Either way, one thing is for certain...it's not my problem. It is nice to be warmly received though... and they are extremely knowledgeable when questioned about the different artists. I felt as though they genuinely gave a shit that words were coming out of my mouth.... how refreshing.  ;-) bringing me to---  #2) The art (recently) - let's just say that I have a couple of new favorite local artists and if things go the way I expect them too, I may not be able to pay my rent next month. The End

The following pretty much sums up my experience at Zoe's:  Me: "Hi, I'd like the turkey pita please"  Zoe(or sum other dumb bitch): "So you'd like the feta with feta?, would you like something to drink, or maybe a side of feta?"  One word..... Sick! (and I actually like feta... well, used to) I will not be back.  Oh, and some extremely old dood hit on me while I was waiting for my lunch. Now, while I don't exactly blame that on Miss Zoe, I am convinced that he wouldn't have been there if it weren't for all that feta.  How is there more than one of these shitholes in the valley?? Someone please explain. blech! 2 stars because my Sun Chips hadn't been tampered with... at least to my knowledge.

I have dropped Zoe's down to one star because it was catered in to a work event that we had recently and I was forced to either eat it or starve.   Fuck you Zoe,  following me around town,  showing up at my work.... You're like a psycho stalker ex-boyfriend.  What's next?? A dozen red roses and some slaughtered animal remains??   Bitch.

This is my go to theater since the remodel. I've never been much of a movie goer, not a huge fan of the whole crammed like sardines into a room with a bunch of strangers thing...AMC Esplanade is a game changer.   I'm a snob when it comes to almost everything, and hey, now I can be snobby about going to the movies too! The food is actually quite good. A significant step up from traditional bar fare. Offering everything from hot wings to fruit salad to the wonderfully tasty Smoked Salmon BLT. The fries are hot and crispy and the service is quick and friendly.  Now, let's talk liquor. When you walk in, the area that used to house popcorn, candy and soda is now a full bar! That's right, a full bar! Better wine and beer selection than I expected and you can still just get some popcorn and a Coke if you so desire.   The theaters themselves are comfortable and seating is just how I like it, recliner type seating with a lot of room between you and everyone else. We ordered our tickets online prior to the showing and were able to choose our seats which is a nice touch. Go! Go now!

It gets the second star for "Hormel Turkey Pepperoni".....  yes, the second star is because they happen to carry a product I can't live without....and no one else seems to carry.  The "security guard" is missing teeth and was doubtfully screened for background.  The place kinda smells like poo. Everything is within about 4 days of it's pull date. They don't understand the importance of green bananas (or produce that isn't in the beginning stages of rot)  That said, I shop at Safeway...... I hit Basha's for pepperoni. That's all folks

um...... no  I have been to this Blockbuster before with out any major issues but the incident that went down the other night provoked me into uncharted yelping territory.  Now, I've had crappy experiences at establishments before (haven't we all) but only a couple of times in my life have I been made to feel criminal. (when I wasn't being a fucking criminal)   I rode down to drop a couple of movies off and pick up a couple more. I don't have a rack or fancy dancy basket on my bike so when I go somewhere that I will need to transport items to or from I wear my backpack. ....can you see where this is going....  I walk in, drop of the movies I had and begin moseying around the store. The 17 yr. old employee comes up to me and asks if I would mind leaving my backpack up at the front. UM... YES KIDDO, I WOULD MIND.  I begin getting disoriented and confused..... did I just step out of a fucking time machine as the 1991 "candy raver" version of myself?? Do I look like I'm about to rob your damn store for anything I can sell so I can buy more ecstasy?? Do I have a "binkie" hanging out of my mouth?? Ahem....... NO. I'm a 32 yr old "lady" that just dropped off 3 movies and can *gasp* afford to rent a couple more. I'm not giving your 17 year old ass my backpack, plain and simple. Why, so you can rob me? No thanks. One thing I will give him is that he didn't put up much of a fight. I said no and he moved on pretty quickly. Still confused, I'm not sure if that's good or bad. I just know I'm pretty sure I'm going to upgrade my Netflix account.  sheesh .... and to think I rode right past Movies On Central.   grrrrr

I hate the word "stew". It's right up there with slacks, moist and congealed. That said, St Francis' Pork Chile Verde ( I refuse to call it Stew...*cringe*) was phenomenal. Wow... just wow. I think I said that I wanted to roll around naked in it. It was that good.   This was my second visit to St Francis, the first visit was wine only. I doubt I'll ever be back without dining again. I'm dying to try the Baked Goat Cheese appetizer..(let's add goat cheese to that list of words I can't stand) and though I'm not a huge fan of sweets, the Chocolate Cake sounds insane. Get this: peanut butter gelato, caramel sauce, homemade caramel corn. Really?......no, really?.... If that doesn't make you need to change your panties (oh great, another word for the list....ewww) nothing will.   I'm fully smitten with their patio. We gnawed relentlessly on some french bread and olive oil. I would love to see more places replace butter with olive oil or at least have the option. It's a petty thing but with everyone being so health conscious it just makes sense and it's tasty.  I can't wait to go back in full on fatty mode and gorge (where are all of these disgusting words coming from) like the closeted fat kid that I am. I'm pretty sure this rating will go up to 5 stars after my next visit.

See what happens when you get ROTD'd?? You break the 2 month hiatus of crap review writing and join the world again. I see what's goin on here Yelp....:)  Too bad I chose to review this place. It doesn't get much worse. DB and slut central in there. The drinks are weak, the food sucks and they blow this ridiculously LOUD horn for no apparent rhyme or reason. I'm thinking to myself  "... did someone leave a fat tip?? was there nipple slippage?? is there a fucking reason this a-hole keeps blowing this stupid horn??"  Answer: no It was like being trapped in some never ending frat nightmare....complete with underage girls dressed like prostitutes, slangin' H20 outside. I witnessed the creepiest exchange between one of these girls and some middle aged dood that should've landed him on "To Catch a Predator".   Trash  Trash Trash I won't be back. There has to be a better place to grab a couple of drinks after a game. I'll keep looking.

I adore Radio Milano. Tried to hit it up this last Thursday evening and found it to be closed. I was really depressed by this as I have had my eye on the deviled eggs and the beautiful bartender boy the last couple of times I've dined here. (neither of which I've been able to try yet...booooo!!)   According to the valet guy across the street at Postino they are scheduled to re-open in early April. Apparently with somewhat more of a "lounge like" feel or some such nonsense. Works for me!  I hope they keep the Tuna Crudo around which is just insanely good. Drown yourself in some chocolate pudding for desert, you won't regret it. Ahhhhh, now I'm hungry... don't worry about me, he was too pretty to be straight anyway.

I feel like a tool reviewing another grocery store. I was MADE to feel like a tool for choosing to grocery shop wearing yoga pants and flip flops instead of $800.00 Louboutins.  Realllly.... how do rich ladies #1,2 and 3 not have someone doing the shopping for them at this point? It was interesting if not a bit disturbing to see the new and improved options in facial rejuvenation. (I'm taking notes for the future; thanks ladies)  The nut bar won my heart. When you've had fresh ground peanut or almond butter you will never purchase regular (what I will refer to from this point forward as "over the counter PB") again. I've never had anything like it.   The wine selection is perfect. I don't feel overwhelmed like I do when  shopping at Total Wine yet it's not your typical run of the mill Safeway selection. It is actually quite difficult to describe, I suggest you go see for yourself.

I'll start off by saying that the meal itself was 5 star all the way. I mean hello!?! Butter poached, bone in Filet Mignon!?!  Need I say more? Indeed...  Based on the previous few experiences I've had at City Hall I would have happily given both the experience and the food 5 stars. This time however I cannot, but I can give 4.   We had a 8:00(pm) reservation on a considerably busy night. Upon arrival, we were sat immediately at a booth in the bar. Normally, this wouldn't bother me at all except that when the reservation was taken, we specifically requested the dining room. We were looking for a  level of ambiance that is difficult to obtain surrounded by fairly raucous bar goers on a Friday night. Clearly we were squeezed in at the last minute.   There was no room for us in the dining area so we say screw it, we'll just eat some amazing food, drink way too much and join the 'party' in the bar area. We're not pretentious assholes, we're flexible, we know how to get the fuck dowwwwn, no big deal right...wrong. While being seated I notice the rather close proximity of the patio door. I take my coat off and within minutes I'm frozen. I know what you're thinking...'well, maybe you shouldn't have been dressed like a $3 hooker Kristi', but you would be wrong. I pulled out all the stops for this one. Needless to say, we notified the server and were promptly moved to another booth. Annoying, but certainly not night altering. Our server seemed a bit distracted and it all felt a bit rushed at first but  seemed to mellow out when we made it clear that we were indeed camping out for the next 3 hours.   There is not much that can be said about the food other than 'it's amazing'. I had a perfectly mixed dry Kettle martini to start of with. (Must get buzz going before food consumption) We shared a bottle of Cab with our meals which consisted of the Petite Filet, (MR) the NY Strip, (R) the out of this world Lobster Mashed Potatoes,  and steamed asparagus.   Perfection! This is what a steak should taste like. The Lobster Mashed was divine and trust me, I don't throw the word 'divine' around EVER. We shared the Creme Brulee for dessert as well as a chocolate martini. I was sufficiently liquored up at this point not to mention fat and happy. Don't ask me what happened after dessert because I don't remember. There was some champagne involved, maybe a creepy cab driver....the details are fuzzy. All I know there was enough food left over to make a delicious breakfast of steak and eggs in the morning, which paired well with the Advil, Alka-Seltzer and gray face of death I was wearing.   Whoo-Haa Mastro's! I am no match for your sexiness. U.N.C.L.E.

I recently had one of the worst days of my life and that's not an exaggeration. I received some really bad news mid day, mid week and kinda walked around in a fog until I get off work at 5:00pm. In a Xanax induced coma; tired and starving due to skipping lunch I happened upon Lucky Boy. I've been meaning to stop in for awhile but just never made it happen.  Now, I'm not one of those chicks that drowns her sorrows in french fries and ice cream, quite the opposite actually so I figured I'd take advantage of my appetite. I ordered an "international burger" and fries and some sort of large carbonated beverage. It was wonderful. The fries were crispy and perfectly salted and the burger was one of the best I've had in a very long time. The ingredients were fresh and the price was right. I'm sure there are better burgers out there, but I can't think of any. I ate the whole fucking thing and was actually sad when the experience was over.   I'll be back soon to gorge myself on some other menu items. Maybe I'll wait for PMS to kick in, maybe I wont. All I have to say is this- there is something comforting about smothering your insides in cheese and oil. Lucky Boy may not solve all of your problems, but it fills the void in your tummy without having to prepare a meal when you are out of your flippin mind. And that's something....

I adore MAC in general but this store is the best. The girls are very helpful and you don't feel like they're talking shit about you behind your back the entire time you're shopping. Helpful without being pushy (very important).   I have never had my makeup done here because I have a phobia with people touching my face.... however I might just have to try and break myself of that soon.   The product itself is fantastic. I just bought some Mineral Powder Foundation that makes my 32 yr old skin "appear" to be 27ish, maybe even younger out of direct sunlight. (maybe even 22ish under blacklight... but we wont go there).  I'm docking one star because they don't have refill sponges for the applicator, so you're stuck washing them which I can't stand.  It's no botox but let me tell ya, when the time comes, I'll let the doctor touch my face all he wants for that shiz. I'll just pop a xanax and slam a glass of wine before my apointment. I mean this is the Biltmore Area right!!?

I'm noticing a trend in my recent reviews. Caffeine!  Best mocha I've had.... bar none. Of course I still love Miss Lola and Lux but if Cartel were closer to home (or the downtown location was open on Sunday) I'd be here all the time.  The wait is long no matter what time you come. Stop whining. Deal with it or go to Starbucks so I don't have to wait so long.  The decor is cool, the location is hidden and there is an abundance of chicks with mullets and dudes with neck beards, neither of which bother me. I had a strange verbal exchange with a barista that left me confused but I think that was due to my foggy Sunday morning state. I haven't experienced the snarky attitude that others have made mention to....and I'm pretty in tune with that sort of thing. Some would say overly so.  One more thing worth mentioning is that the music is at a decibel level that it's not a nightmare trying to hold a conversation. (take note Lux) As a matter of fact, I could hear the hilariously awkward conversation next to me. That's always fun...

I'm a smitten kitten. Just beautiful. The coffee was fantastic and being that Oscar's is no where near my area of town, I wish I had been able to explore Harper's Nursery a little more. Thankfully my mocha was so tasty there will definitely be a round 2...3,4,5 you get where I'm going with this...  A quaint, lovely place to relax and enjoy a great tasting cup of coffee. You could easily miss this nursery/coffee stand while looking for a caffeine fix and if it weren't for Yelp, I never would've known it was there. I encourage you to stop, take a moment, have a latte and pretend you're somewhere else.

I really should never have tried Mamma Mia's. The same way I should never have tried Two Hippies Burger joint (which is conveniently located next door). In fact, that's where I was headed at the time but they were closed.   Being a fairly clean eater, my body does not know what to do with itself during these Sunday grease fueled gorge fests I seem to put myself through after a night of debauchery. My stomach hates me!  I had a slice of plain cheese and a slice of pepperoni and yes, I devoured both. Quickly, quietly and with the stealth of a truly seasoned binge eater. Damn it was good. The slices were huge and foldable with the crust being the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. Delicious! The only complaint I have is that it's hot as hell in there. Not much can be done about that, so it's merely an afterthought.   Mamma Mia's is close to home and that makes me nervous. Nervous is good. It means I have a crush on you...  *blush*

I'm a total yoga noob, attending my first class about a year and a half ago. I viewed it as a great workout and break from my more typical training, involving mostly lifting a lot of heavy shit (i.e. weights) and some running. While I enjoyed it, nothing really resonated with me at the time. Spending the last year or so doing some pretty intense self reflection and major work on staying 'present' when faced with...well, life I guess, I decided it was time to bring yoga back into my world.   Enter Urban Yoga.   The location is perfect, (within walking distance from my building) the space is gorgeous and has a very calming feel to it. The staff seem to be genuine and all very helpful, and each class I've attended has felt incredibly comfortable, even for a fairly reserved person such as myself.   The only time I felt uncomfortable was last night when I attended my first Ashtanga class. Actually, uncomfortable is an understatement.   Prior to this I had only experienced the Urban Flow class and Core Vinyasa Flow. I immediately thought I was in over my head with all the Sanskrit Asana call outs, all with little to no explanation and I had a little bit of a panic attack moment. I'm dead serious when I say that I was just about to freak out, grab my mat and get the hell out of there when I accepted that my fear and feelings of inferiority were just that, mine. No one was laughing at the doofus in the corner all doe eyed and scared shitless. I took a deep breath (or many) and kept up the best I could. I'm glad I stayed because I left feeling great psychically and mentally and like I had taken a huge step to overcome an issue that has haunted me probably since birth, or at least chip away at a part of it.   Studio Yoga is not cheap folks...anywhere, including Urban Yoga But the benefits I have personally received from continuing to make the effort to get up and go far outweigh the cost. Six months ago I would have walked right out of there and never come back out of feeling foolish and being embarrassed. Six months ago I would have been embarrassed to admit that I felt foolish and embarrassed. (sounds funny, but trust me, being that self aware is pure hell) Not yesterday. Not tomorrow either. I highly recommend Urban Yoga.

Seriously folks!!  I just got a note in my Inbox from the owner, Brad K. of Organic Cleaners, apologizing for my first experience with them. (which wasn't bad mind you, the price just gave me a bad taste)   I find that honorable and it shows that you truly care about your business and your customer base. I'm actually having two items of clothing altered at Organic Cleaners as we speak (I've yet to find a better seamstress) and I will definitely be back with some work shirts and pencil skirts.  Kudos for providing a quality product and caring about your customers.

This place is deeefuckinglicious! I would possibly donate a limb to the cause if it meant I could transplant this place somewhere in downtown or mid-town Phoenix. Though, if I'm being honest, that might take away from some of it's charm and thankfully I have family in the neighborhood so I'll make the drive.   The food, in a word, fantastic! My brother and his family introduced us and are frequent patrons of this place and it's obvious as to why. It's a foodie paradise in the way of quality and you just don't see that with deli style dining very often. The Warm Proscuitto Wrapped House Made Mozzarella that we started our meal with is a great example of what I'm talking about. They appear to take great pride in ingredient quality and execution, and it didn't stop there. I enjoyed a half Roast Chicken Breast w/ Sautéed Onions, Tomato, Bacon, Melted Swiss, Lettuce & Tomato Aioli on Ciabatta and a side of Free Range Chicken & Sweet Corn Chowder. It was as good as it sounds. I also tried a couple of bites of my fiance's Roast Beef & Melted Pepper Jack w/ Caramelized Onions and roasted peppers which gave me an immediate case of order envy, something that is definitely not new to me. What can I say, I like to eat!  The waitstaff was friendly and the service was excellent. We were greeted immediately and the servers timing was on point. The wine menu is impressive, even offering some local love such as a few varietals from Arizona Stonghold and Page Springs Cellars. The beer menu while small, has a few quality (and local) offerings and is varied enough to satisfy most everyone. The Deli also offers up some unusual and interesting ice cream flavors that I'm anxious to try on my next visit, which will be soon. I also look forward to checking out 'Poppy's Place' which is a cute little bar affiliated with The Deli and conveniently located right next door.   Go once and go often! The Deli is well worth the drive!

So.........  I'm pretty sure the bartender was wasted.  Other than that I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was awesome and the drinks were strong. Any place with infused vodka(s) is alright in my book by default. It's just that I'm about 96.3% sure that the bartender was wayyysted. It was distracting. It seemed like the more we drank, the more fucked up she became (not to mention she kept "excusing herself for a moment" ahem..... ) sniff sniff?? one never knows..  Anyway, everyone blowing Chu reminds me a lot of everyone blowing Bianco, which is a little annoying, but I do get it. He is an amazing chef and a very nice guy. I'm dying to go back on a night when I can really spend some time and try everything on the menu. Yes, everything... small plates people and this girl can put it down.   One last thing.... after reading the last hand full of reviews, I don't recommend touching ANYTHING in that bathroom.  I kid I kid

I'm hesitant to bust out 5 stars for this place because they've only been open for 2 days but I can't help myself. I think i may have found a new haunt.  The bartender (possibly part owner) and what I can only assume was the other owner were extremely attentive and nice..... just plain nice, I miss nice alot, most people are assholes. Ya, ya, you're probably thinking "well, it is day two, of course they're going to be overly attentive"... and that may be so, I just hope it sticks.   Things were still in a very preliminary stage in a lot of ways but you can see the potential when you walk up the stairs. Super cute "ikea-ish" decor, couch like seating area as well as high bar tables, low, very chill lighting, full bar..... that's right people!!! Full bar!! They even asked us our opinion on the music and if we had any recommendations. AWESOME!  The pour was good and strong and I'm told they are going to be "married" so to speak with Pei Wei to offer appetizers in the next couple weeks.   There were only a couple of other people there at the time, slightly older wine bar crowd.  So let's band together, get some sessy (younger)  mother F'krs together and turn this place into what it's meant to be.... a badass downtown drink spot.

I must be a snobby snobby bitch.  Nope... just sober. Trust me, I tried to remedy that as quickly as possible so I could deal with this place. We were there on a Saturday evening around 9. Maybe it's okay as a Sunday day drinking spot but I'll never know,  because I'll never be back.  Long story short: I came uncomfortably close to getting into a physical altercation with a man. Yes, all 112lbs of me and some of you will be surprised that I was not the instigator. I was NOT.  You know that look.... that certain "sociopath" type look that serial killers have; the eyes are set a little too close together and their head slightly resembles a loaf of bread, pinched in at the temples. Well that's this guy....annnnnnd all of his equally roided out homies. The experience was actually scary and I don't scare easily.   "Killer" wasn't the only reason for the sour taste in my mouth. The place was a little campy/cheesy and not really in the way I like. I can't really put my finger on it but it just wasn't my thing. The service was slow but the place was packed to the gills with every ass clown on the planet, so I'll cut them some slack there. We wanted to eat but there was no place to sit, as any of the open tables had reserved signs on them. Oh........reallllly, bottle service anyone? LAME  I'm not sure if that was the case or not, it just seemed douchey and try hard. Shocking  I will say one thing. This experience and the few others that I've had leading up to it have made me come to terms with something very special. I don't belong here and by here I mean Scottsdale. Unless of course someone would like to take me to City Hall for a sexy steak dinner. That's my idea of a good time. I doubt highly I'll fear getting punched in the face at Mastro's.

Call me a cab bitches! It's official!  Postino Central is my absolute favorite day drinking spot.   I'm in love with all things vino. Some of you know this intimately. (some of you meaning anyone who's ever read any of my reviews) More importantly, I love $5 wine by the glass. Mostly because it ensures that I'm a fairly cheap date, but also because I like to try new things, so even if I hate it...hey, it was only 5 bucks.    The place isn't teaming with douchebags, which is fantastic. I think it's a prerequisite that you be easy on the eyes to work there...equally fantastic for both boys and girls, though it seems to be a predominately male crew...so, like I said...  The atmosphere is solid. Bright, with an open airy feeling even if you aren't sitting on the patio. There is a Circle K conveniently located across the street, you know, in case you (or someone who shall remain nameless to protect his pretty dignity) are in dire need of a couple of Vitamin Waters and a gigantic box of Sugar Babies because it seems like a REALLY good idea after 3 pitchers of Odell's... until you start looking like a dog chewing peanut butter because you can't get them out of your teeth!!...Fuck!! There goes a filling..  but that's a story for another time.  The food is quite tasty and I'm a huge fan of Bruschetta. My favorites including the Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Salami with Pesto and my all time favorite, Tomato Jam with fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese. It sounds a little suspect but I promise you won't regret it.  I've enjoyed every Panini I've tried with favorites being Prosciutto with Brie and Autostrada (my soppresatta mistress continues to haunt me) *sigh* I was forced into sharing dessert once, it was some chocolate cake extravaganza that was insanely good, though I don't remember the name.   Good wine, good tunes, great atmosphere and delicious food + excellent company and slurred speech = good times had by all! Cheers!

Really........FOUR stars on the previous review Kristi....realllllllllyyyy?  The food and drink, as always, is on point. Occasionally, they make small changes to the bruschetta menu which I enjoy because hey, who doesn't like to try something new when you're pretty confident it's going to be AMAZING! Helloooo Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes!!  There is some kind of crazy love vortex (minus the twisted trees) surrounding this Postino location. Seriously, everyone else disappears. Don't plan a date here unless you are prepared to eventually propose or accept said proposal.   Don't say I didn't warn you.

How did I miss this? I'm the chick that bitches endlessly about the lack of sushi in the downtown/midtown area. Seriously, how.... in the hell.....did I miss this??   Anyway, I love this place. The sushi was fantastic (in my opinion) but then again I'm not some self important sushi snob, so take that for what it's worth. Everything tasted fresh and the service was great. The only complaint I have is the chairs..... who's brilliant idea were those horrible wire chairs. My bony ass was not happy after sitting there for an hour and a half.  Whatever, I found a new date spot. The bf was as impressed as I was and since we live so close I'm sure Moira will be in regular rotation. Screw you Zen

What a lovely way to end an amazing weekend. I will definitely be returning, and next time it will be on a Saturday instead of a Sunday so we have time to get our day drink on. (They close at 3pm on Sunday)   Best Bloody Mary I've ever had. This is not a typo. Perfection! We only had one because of the very busy day of shopping and dodging Auburn fans that lie ahead but trust that this will be rectified soon.   We ordered the Sawmill Gravy with Biscuits and the Vegan Sandwich with fries. Both were incredibly tasty, meaning I ate half of my sandwich and stared longingly at the biscuits and gravy, giving in at the last minute by stealing repeated bites. I'm not vegan, I can do that.  The table next to us had some sort of french toast concoction that looked out of this world. (Yes, I was the creeper eye raping your french toast. My apologies.) I'm not a huge fan of sweets, especially at breakfast/brunch time but I'm putting this on the list of things to try. Clearly, a list that will grow along with my waistline. nom nom nom   The owner is sweet and greets you in a very genuine way upon entering. Not some 16 year old emo kid that doesn't know how to make eye contact. Score!  The service was a little slow, as mentioned in some other reviews but somehow it just kind of flowed with the laid back feeling of the place. The decor takes shabby chic to a new level and has a very relaxed vibe. Kinda makes you want to smoke a big fatty and drink mimosas all day long. Not that I've ever done that...    Places like this make me happy that I live where I do instead of the dreaded 'burbs'. It's nice to see parts of downtown flourish and I will continue to support these establishments by way of alcoholism and emotional eating. Especially if someone else is picking up the tab. You have earned a way into my heart Local Breeze!

Lola is like Lux's bourgeois older sister. You want to hate her for her materialistic/conformist ways and then you wake up and realize that you are her. Skinny jeans don't look good on YOU...they look good on your 20-something 90lb sis. Yeah yeah, you're hip...but that shaggy mop top shit doesn't translate well to the boardroom. The only thing you have in common at this point is your stupid Prius.  You've grown up kid.   It's a little hard to accept at times, but you will. Your penchant for malnourished, tattooed, possibly sexually confused boys has given way to men. Grownups with stability, good jobs and a formal education. Your idea of a good time has gone from $1.00 PBR specials to 50% off any bottle of wine deals. It's been a long time coming darlin' but you're ready. Embrace, with love, these changes because you can't do shit about it....and you can't live in the past.   (Believe it or not, this ENTIRE review was about coffee)

This gym is over sold. Period. Really, I could stop right there but what's the fun in that.   Since cleaning out my proverbial closet of alcoholic loser 'friends', I tend to spend a lot of time at the gym. Between the gym in my building and this LA Fitness I try and work out about 5-6 days a week. I really prefer to use this gym is on the weekend though occasionally I'll go after work for the step mill (something my work gym doesn't provide) and to try and get some lifting in. TRY being the operative word. UGH! Where are all the damn free weights? Is everyone using 15-20lb weights? No, then where the fuck are they?  The cardio machines are all old and outdated and in the summer the place is a sweat box. A stinky one too, I'm talking to you onion lady! Wash your clothes. You smell like onion rings and feces. Geeeeez... Steer clear of the locker room too. Really, the building just needs an overhaul at this point.   Between onion lady, dodging MRSA  and the swelter, it's hard to justify the $25 bucks a month. Yes, that's incredibly cheap but I feel gypped when I see how nice the Scottsdale and Ahwatukee locations are for the same price.    I will say, watching the gay boys eye rape my man like it's going out of style is wildly entertaining. The price one pays for being a hot straight man in a primarily gay establishment I suppose. Needless to say, due to the ratio, I get mostly left alone which is unusual in a gym environment and greatly appreciated. That and the proximity to work/home clearly is enough to keep me coming back.  *sigh*

I'm bumping my former review up to 4 stars because of the owner comment below.   It shows a great deal of class, something my reviews often lack, (though I make no apologies for that...I don't pull punches and I value honesty over false refinement or 'charm') to address the aforementioned issues I had with Sleepy Dog that kept my original review from being 4 stars in the first place.   I will definitely be back. I look forward to learning a bit more and enjoying a positive experience.  *just found out they offer some AZ wines as well.....I'm officially reformed

Yay! I'm a fan pretty much sums it up!  'Giant Coffee'....  hmmm While I have no idea what the hell that's supposed to mean, I do like that it seems to elicit  playful banter, in which we get to bust out our best porn star voices and use the phrase 'GIANT coffee' in place of other more descriptive words whilst discussing where to go for our Saturday morning fix. It's fun, try it.   On to the meat and potatoes :  The coffee was good. My mocha was not sweet at all, something I actually enjoyed. There's a fine line between sweet and syrupy and hey, I'd rather have to add a lump of sugar myself than be stuck in nestle chocolate syrup hell.   The little chicky that took our order was cute and bubbly. She asked if we had ever been there before and seemed to genuinely care that we enjoy our experience. I really like the idea of not yelling out the customers name but table service for coffee also seemed a bit weird. I would prefer the latter of course and could definitely get over the awkwardness.. it's probably just me anyway..  The space itself was outstanding. I am a table girl, not a couch girl (especially if I'm there less to socialize and more to surf). The work counter area is perfect for me as I don't like having people at my back when I'm working on my novel..... okay, checking my facebook, whatever. Having someone at my back when I'm on my computer is a pet peeve of mine and there is enough seating to accommodate multiple people with similar neurosis. High five!   My only real complaint is the lack of an obvious space or bus-tub in which to leave your empties. Maybe I just missed it. I'm certainly not leaving it on the table and felt kinda silly walking back up to the counter all wide eyed and dorky 'Errrr...hey guys, what do I do with this...'. Again, I'm a neurotic train-wreck so sometimes human interaction gets the best of me.   So ya, 4 stars!!

Happy birthday to me! Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had.   My date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.  We started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload.   The menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer.   As for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...  This was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.  I have a true soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB!  I don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.  One more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together. They do. Let them scoff. The only rule is that there aren't any.

Ummm.....so.....what's up with the whole 'goat' thing.  Has no one else noticed the goat theme? How has this not been mentioned??  Seriously, there's a goat head hanging on the wall (possibly more than one), little goats on the menus and bill book. I half expected to look up in the ladies room to find a goat peering over the stall. It was creepy and confusing. I NEED to understand it!! or...maybe not.  Moving forward: The food was truly fantastic. We had the pork belly and deviled eggs with caviar, which were the two standouts for me. The meatball dish wasn't bad, I just feel as though I could have made it at home with things I already have in my refrigerator, so all in all, nothing special.  Our Manhattan's were quite good overall but lacked consistency. If there was a next time, I would stick to wine.  The problems I have with Mabel's are the following: If this review was based on food alone, it would warrant at least 4 stars, however the running question between myself and my guy the entire evening (other than the goat conundrum) was whether or not we even saw anyone else order or eat anything. That may not matter much to anyone, but why waste such talent on a place that seems to serve little more purpose than to be the next drop in for a bunch of 30k douchebags and  their cheap, tacky, sparkly dressed girlfriends. Seriously ladies and partially tucked gents, 1998 called, it wants it's bad taste back. Have some class. I don't need to see your manscaped chest or your womans' ass cheek hanging out of the bottom of her $29.99 dress.   I may have been able to bump the rating up to three stars if the service wasn't  so awkward. I can't stand it when a server (almost always female) makes eye contact and directs conversation to my date only. I don't appear threatening, I smile a lot and try to make eye contact, I'm not going to bite you.....LOOK AT ME!!  I'm a pretty cool chick and I'd like you to acknowledge my existence...thanks. For some reason, this happens to me frequently. I waited tables myself back in the day and I can't wrap my brain around that one but oh well.   All in all the food was excellent. Drinks were alright. Service was weird. If we hadn't already had a table from dinner and were forced to stand I could totally see myself wanting to shank some bitches.  The whole experience felt a little 'Twilight Zone' especially with the goat situation. Doubtful return.

I hesitate to bust out 5 stars after one appointment but when you've been through what I have with multiple doctors and you find one that listens, respects your...errr...'inquisitive nature', is willing to work WITH you and isn't an ego driven maniac you kind of want to shout it from the roof tops. So, YAY Dr. Andrea O'Conner!! 5 stars!  A little back story.. I've unknowingly struggled with Thyroid Disease for at least 4 years, maybe longer. Being confronted with a barrage of wacky symptoms like exhaustion, muscle weakness, depression, hardcore mood swings, edema, digestive issues, abdominal bloat, slow heart rate, low blood pressure, weight gain, severe joint pain, brain fog to the point of being mid sentence and forgetting words, freezing cold all the time and oh yeah....pulling CLUMPS of hair out of my head every day in the shower and having Marilyn Manson eyebrows (read: completely gone) is scary to say the least. It's also frightening how long one will endure things like this all the while attributing everything to 'getting older'. By the way, I'm 36 not 86. Never underestimate the power of denial!  It took some crazy blood sugar issues and kidney disease markers to drive me to an endocrinologist. I was diagnosed hypothyroid (thrilled at this revelation because I was thoroughly convinced I had cancer or was dying) given a nominal dose of dessicated thyroid hormone and told I would feel 'a lot better very very soon'.  Let's just say that statement was laughable.   Fast forward 8 months, 3 doctors, a shitload of research and self treatment on my part (out of desperation, not recommended of course) and I have found Naturopath, Dr. Andrea O'Conner. A weight has been lifted! Not once during my appointment with her was she condescending or did I feel like I was not being taken seriously. Her personality and the way she presents herself is also very genuine and without airs which I appreciate. I was honest about my previous experiences and what I expected and we have outlined a nice course of treatment that we are both comfortable with.   If you have hormonal issues don't waste your time with an MD or Endocrinologist. Office appointments are not covered by insurance but lab work is and it's worth the out of pocket expense to regain control of your health. Phoenix Integrative Medicine offers all of those lovely aesthetic treatments like botox and dermal fillers, HCG etc. While I don't use those services, I would be comfortable referring someone to them with the experience I had.  Be your own advocate.

You know that Groucho Marx quote: "I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member."  Well here's my version:   "I wouldn't want to dine in any establishment that would have a fucking GINORMOUS photograph of Sheriff Joe Arpio taking up half of the wall as though his presence there is a good thing."  The only thing that could have made me more uneasy would have been if they superimposed good ol' Joe onto a giant 'last supper' painting, stuck tooth pics in my eyes and forced me to recite the ten commandments while force feeding myself mediocre sweet potato fritters and a ridiculous burger the size of my head, man vs. food style.   The burger itself was......good. Not fantastic, just good. The sweet potato fritters were a joke. When something is that boring and uninspired it really needs to come with something like, oh...I dunno...25 dipping sauces. I'm sure I've seen deep fried boring remedied by flavored lard in the past. Get on the ball Grind.   The service was okay. The whisky tango flavored waitstaff, all brunette with a similar 'look'  was interesting. Like if you took all of the servers at The Vig and secretly replaced them with Famous Sams waitresses; that kind of interesting.   The beer and wine selection was clearly lacking and again, uninspired. I suppose the focus is supposed to be on the specialty drinks which actually seemed well thought out though none seemed to appeal to me in the moment. Also, if you're going to name one of your signature cocktails after a classic James Bond martini it should be made with the proper ingredients, or at least as close as possible. I think they sell Lillet Blanc at Total Wine, hell, the bf has some in his fridge, I'm sure he'll let you borrow it.   All in all, an odd experience that kind of failed my expectations. In closing, I'll leave you with another Marx quote that kind of sums it all up:   "I've had a perfectly wonderful evening. But this wasn't it."

This is the perfect example of a time I wish there was a 'half star' policy. That doesn't happen to me very often as I'm rather opinionated and deliberate and honestly, in the interest of maintaining those qualities, I just can't give Stingray 3+ stars...so 2 it is.   Where to begin. The food was fine...  Choosing to dine at a place like Stingray, I'm well aware of what I've signed up for. Meaning pedestrian, cookie cutter, 'safe' sushi, with lots of rolls covered in some form of mayo or sweet eel sauce. Nothing you can't douse in loads of wasabi soy sauce and call 'okay'.  Very RA-esque or Kona style stuff we're talking about here. I actually like that kind of easypeasy 'sushi' sometimes. Just bring me more wine so I can google eye at my fiance across the table and we're fine. That said, the experience was still severely lacking in many areas.   Someone needs to tell the staff at Stingray that it's no longer 2004. Everything from the decor to the servers uniforms to their air of pretension screamed mortgage boom. A time when everyone thought they were millionaires in training, had $850 a month car payments, raging strip club habits and not a lick of common sense. Guess what guys, those days are long gone.   The service was just plain not good. Think pretty and vapid. All style (though, honestly, there was no real 'style' going on) and no substance. What I can only assume was the manager dropped our check off and didn't  look in our direction or say a word. It was rude and weird, almost as if we should feel special to be ALLOWED to dine in their establishment. Our server appeared to be pretty young and I try to give a little leeway to the young and dumb but it was pretty evident that the young part was coincidental. She was a dolt, complete with eyes rolling around in her head like creepy little black marbles....ugh. How this girl has survived on the planet this long is beyond me, what with busy streets to cross and rohypnol availability and all. I dunno, the whole thing was just uncomfortable and strange. Luckily as soon as we walked out the door all was restored with the universe. It was 2011 again, we were all poor, people were still being foreclosed on and I was still 35...meh. Whatever, I was glad to be living in the present and I doubt I'll time travel via Stingray Sushi again anytime soon.

I need to preface this by saying that this review was taken from 3 to 4 stars by way of dessert, but I'll get into that later.    I was invited to check out Seasons 52 last Thursday evening with a friend that I haven't seen in way too long and after checking out the menu online, it was a date! Seriously, google it, if your mouth doesn't water your a corpse.  Everyone's really excited about the 'everything under 475 calories' thing and I get it...I suppose that is a pretty statement move on Seasons part. I will say that everything we had also tasted like it had less than 475 calories, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing, I wouldn't come to Seasons for a steak if you know what I'm saying.....(i.e. filet mignon deserves a butter bath in my humble opinion)   That said, I decided on the Caramelized  Sea Scallops with asparagus and sundried tomato pearl pasta (errrrr, Israeli Couscous) and my dining companion decided on.......wait for it........  The Mesquite-Grilled Filet Mignon with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables and roasted mushrooms! Yep!   I did actually get to try it and like I said, I wouldn't come here for a steak. I, however, am the snobbiest of steak snobs so take that for what it's worth. It also didn't look like a Filet to me, more of a well pounded out top sirloin. I'm not claiming any deception, it just looked odd.   My scallops were quite tasty and even though I missed the flavor that butter searing produces I would definitely order them again. The asparagus and pasta were good though surely difficult to really 'mess up'.   The wine list was decent and I'm impressed that Seasons offers alternative menus for those that are vegetarian/vegan or have certain allergies or intolerance.   This is when secksi time comes into play and the reason for the fourth star. DESSERT!  Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse and Pumpkin Pie with Ginger Snap Crust. Holy mother these little guys were divine. Served in what appear to be shot glasses, this was the perfect amount of sweet and delicious for two people that just consumed probably the healthiest thing they've eaten all week. Very rich and heavy, clearly hitting the 'under 475 calorie' mark by size alone.   The restaurant itself has a pretty standard chain look/feel to it, reminiscent of a slightly upscale Cheesecake Factory. The service was great. Our server, Samantha was adorable and bubbly and was armed with enough familiarity of the menu to answer our questions knowledgeably.   All in all a good experience. I'd go back for a dessert and wine happy hour (or four) in a second.

5 stars. You heard me.  Man, am I late on this review...  My sweetie took me to dinner at CPH for my 35th birthday. I know what you're all thinking... "but Kristi...you don't look a day over 34&3/4." Stop....no, pleassssseeee enough with the flattery folks. I can't take it anymore. No seriously. Keep going..  Turns out CPH is right up there with the likes of Nobuo at Teeter House and FnB when it comes to quality and experience. Excellent wine selection. Please, if you have the opportunity, try the 'Tender Belly' bacon fat heirloom popcorn. It was delicious. Though bacon fat could probably make dog poo tasty.   I enjoyed the Porcini-dusted Filet Mignon, medium rare and had a couple of nibbles of my fiance's scallops (which were amazing). The Filet was cooked to perfection and though I'm somewhat of a purist and usually prefer my steak 'au-natural' I was beyond satisfied with the accoutrement. Impressed even.   The service was phenomenal. The distress surrounding my age caused me to consume a gigantic Ketel martini, a shit load of wine (local by the way, I love that) and a desert drink and not once was I cut off. Truly though, our server was a doll. Engaging and genuine; something obviously lacking in the service industry in Arizona.   The only thing I would change about CPH is the location and that's only due to my location, so I'll deal with it.

I love this place!!  I've never been a fan of group training of any kind because I feel like a total goober jumping around in front of strangers and steady state cardio is my nemesis e.g. treadmills, elliptical etc. I do only enough to keep my heart healthy and prefer lifting heavy weight with some active rest, getting me in and out of the gym in 45 minutes tops; but I have a confession to make....I'm in love with Zumba.   I hate saying the word. I wish it had another name. Zumba! Zumba! Zumba! There, maybe I can get over it and move forward.  The vibe at In The RA is truly fantastic and unlike anything I've experienced anywhere else. It's clear from the moment you walk in that this studio is the owners proverbial 'baby' and that feeling of genuine acceptance and caring extends to the entire staff. You actually feel like a total goober jumping around with a bunch of friends instead of strangers...and that I don't mind.  In The RA offers a slew of other classes as well including Real Ryder (which is like a spin class on steroids), Turbo Kick (my least favorite, meh) and even Yoga/Pilates. I believe there is some sort of 'Flirty Fitness' class as well, which, if a pole were involved I'd be much more game to try.  (homegirl can work a pole ...shhhh)  Anyway, you get the point.  My gym of choice is right next door, Tangible Fitness, so it's convenient to get some training in and then walk over for a class. I can't say Zumba anymore without my brain exploding so I'm going to leave it at that.   Thanks for bringing such a great studio to the valley and much success to you In The RA!

It's all true! Jenny is amazing! My husband and I had an elopement ceremony in St. Lucia about a week ago. We married in April after a little over a year of engagement because we just couldn't wait anymore.   I know, I know...barf, right?   After 7+ years of screwy on and off intense passion, boozy shouting matches and emotional reunions we finally grew up and realized we didn't really want to live without each other if we didn't have to....so we decided not to... Pretty cool eh. :) And so began our journey into adulthood (in our 30's) and my journey to find a dress that didn't make me look like a porn star or a beached whale (both of which are looks that have landed me on my own personal 'wost dressed' list in the past).   Jenny took a dress that when purchased, I was swimming in, and turned it into a glorious doily that appeared to be sewn to my body. I could bend, I could breathe, I could do a creepy pathetic strip tease in our suite to lure my hubs to the buffet because I had too much rum at 10am.... (pre-ceramony jitters)  This woman is amazing at her craft and I would trust her to alter anything to perfection. Dealing with the material of my dress was no easy task and upon close inspection, you would never know it had been touched by a seamstress. The turn around time was very quick and I had my finished dress weeks before my trip. I highly recommend Jenny and Perfect Bride Alterations and Couture.

Such a blast! I can't wait to come back and get all Picaso or van Gogh or  whoever was more intoxicated, all over that little canvas.   Throughout the years I've been compelled to express myself artistically in several ways. Throughout the years I've been compelled to treat myself (or mainline, whatev..) several varietals of wine. Writing and painting are two things I thoroughly enjoy doing under the influence. There is now a place I can indulge at least two of these loves... Enter: The Brush Bar  The space is bright and unique and encourages creativity. There are a lot of hand crafted items for sale around the shop. One of the coolest things I've seen in awhile are the shelves in the retail area.....so quirk and interesting. Built by one of the employees fathers from a birch-y looking white wood and wine bottles, they were begging to come home with me . I don't think they were for sale but still... beautiful.  The employees were welcoming, helpful and adorable; I mean seriously, I haven't seen that many cute girls in one place in forever. If I were a single guy I'd totally go one weekend with an equally single buddy or two to see what kind of trouble I could get into.   The painting part is pretty self explanatory. It's fun to get up, walk around and take a look at what everyone is doing about 3/4 of the way through. There's so much room for interpretation and the drastic differences and even sometimes subtle ones are very telling. We left inspired (and buzzed) and headed out for a nice afternoon of lunching. It was a bit pricey but this isn't something you're going to be doing once a week so no big deal. Go...go now.
