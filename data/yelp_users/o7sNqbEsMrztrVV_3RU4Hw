I love this team and they're all super friendly and so is the doctor you would be in good hands if you pick this office to care for your family.

Dr. English and his team treated me and my daughters very well. He addressed all of my questions and concerns. And most importantly helped resolve some skin issues that we were struggling with for years. I highly recommend this office it is clean, comfortable, and up-to-date. And Kim at the front is very nice and accomodating.

I really tried to like this place. It is across the street from where we live and we tried it twice. Service is slow. Do not waste your money on the open faced turkey sandwich it is made with very processed cheap quality lunch meat and brown gravy..........the fried sandwiches are tasty though. I must mention that I bought a large amount of fudge to give out as gifts to clients and was very frustrated every time I tried to pick up portions of my prepaid order...The gift boxes that were presented to me were smeared with little bits of the fudge and soon after they tried to make me use old stock of theirs that just did not have the look I was promised. I would buy a small amount fudge for personal use but not for my office.

Tried this place again because I was dying for a chicken fried steak but it was the worst thing I've ever eaten. The waitress was very nice and gave me biscuits and sausage which were decent and didn't charge me for the steak. But overall still a major disappointment.   A month ago when my daughter was sick I ordered the chicken and dumpling soup but was grossed out when the guy bagging it up had dirty fingernails.   I would love for this place to improve since its literally across the street from my home.

Love the food, ambience, and drink but tonight we obviously overstayed our welcome. After ordering two entrees and a bottle of Moscato our server seems to want us to hurry out the door unless we are ordering dessert. Weird though because the restaurant isn't very busy at the moment and if were allowed to relax and have our girls dinner I'm sure we would be in the mood to order more drink and dessert. Wish Tim was here tonight because I promised my friend a great experience now I'm not sure she will come back. And I may but not anytime soon.

Decided to meet a friend afterwork and had a wonderful time here. The Brie w apricot spread was delicious and the Italian Moscato is heavenly. The service was warm and friendly. It was a pleasure to know that customer's feedback is taken seriously. The management/owner is a class act!

I am so sad to report that their cupcakes are awful. They look gorgeous(and the packaging is adorable) but they are way to sweet and the texture of the cakes is spongy not moist. The pumpkin cake is decent, the pecan is disgusting(and I love pecan anything!) the chocolate mint were ok but all three of my cupcake loving kids wouldn't eat more than two bites. It is a shame this is a chain since they cannot tweak their recipes. If you are a photographer and need cupcakes in your shots then spend your money here but if you want edible cupcakes keep looking.

I'm warming up to this location and am thrilled the food has improved (almost as good as the Williams-Field location). The service has improved too!

Dr. Valenzuela and Dr. Chang are wonderful caring doctors. They get you in the same day and treat you with respect. I have called the afterhours # and they always call back quickly.
