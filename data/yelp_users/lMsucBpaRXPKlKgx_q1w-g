Bonjour amigos!  This here Italian place is THE best Italian place I've tried in Phoenix! In fact, it's the ONLY place I've tried! The staff is friendly. We sat at the bar with a stranger and had a memorably delightful time. The food isn't the most filling, but it is DELICIOUS. Everytime I think of Postinos Arcade, I'll always remember the fun conversation we had with that stranger, and the good food.  PROTIP: We went there on a Saturday and if you want to park you need to valet, which is a whole $3. Do you know what I could do with $3? I could buy bubblegum, get 64% off a DVD at the Walmart $5 bin, and I can even buy a used book! Outrageous!  The only problems was there is no post office to drop off your mail, nor is there an arcade. I think that's false advertising.  Aree Va Dare Chee!

I brought some Arabians here. They never experienced Korean food, or even held chop sticks.  The waiter taught them how to use chopsticks. And the guys fell in love with both the Korean women there, and the bulgogi.   I have converted them from Islamic to Bulgogi-ists.

Came in. My car died.  They jumped it.  I accidentally turned it off. Looked like an idiot.  Got the battery replaced at AutoZone, came back here.  They were still as friendly as ever.  I always feel like anything car related --sales, repair, accessories-- is just a big opportunity to be scammed. It's like my lack of knowledge intimidates me. But at Sounds Good to Me, the crew was just awesome. Friendly every step of the way. Repaired my feedback issue with the head unit, and they did it at a great price. Especially considering I tried doing it myself and it's like someone attacked Jumanji with electric tape.  Super friendly. Great prices. Will come back for my other car audio needs.

I believe that the dirtier, greasier, and more homemade the food is, the better. And Z's Greek is all those things!  With food like this, how can the city of Greece be going out of business?   The seasoned fries are like if Willy Wonka opened a Seasoned Fry Factory fulfilling sensational features and sliding forcefully and steadfastly fat filling fries.

I took my date here. It looked like a very classy restaurant so we dressed very classy: she looked especially gorgeous in her white blouse against her red lipstick, and I decorated myself with a button-up, chino's, and a purple bow-tie around my neck that matched how breathless I felt being near her. This was to be an especially romantic night --a big night for an important decision, one that makes or breaks our time together. And J&G Steakhouse provided the perfect setting.  Walking into J&G I did feel a bit self-conscious about being overly-dressed as I saw people in t-shirts, but honestly, the steakhouse has such a comfortable blend of contemporary rustic-ness that whatever you wear will be hidden in the atmosphere of pure class and low-ambient lighting. Nonetheless, the hostess complimented my date on her outfit, and she blushed. Points awarded right through the door.  Walking in and you immediately notice the lighting: it's dimly lit, but  these tall glass walls offer light to the area around them, and it gives a classy atmosphere. There's a woman on the piano playing and singing on the other side of the long dining hall, and it sounds like romance itself.  And it's loud. But that's good --because you have to draw closer to your date in order to hear her.   The menu is pricey, but fancy. We opted for the 5-course meal and wine pairing ($60+$35 each). The waitress presented the wine to be served with the course, explained why they chose it and how it will affect the meal, poured our glasses, and then the waiters presented our food. They were constantly replacing mats, pouring more water, replacing forks --we never went without throughout the whole evening.   The food was delicious. I wasn't blown away by any course in particular. For being new dishes paired with new wines, nothing stood out. It was good and tasty. Throughout the night we smiled and shared stories. It was the perfect place to just "be" together.  I reserved the table a week out and asked them to seat us in an "ideal view of the sunset." They sat us in front of these large window panes that faced south, but we couldn't barely see the west. I was bummed! I wanted our special night to be adorned with beautiful skies and memorable paintings by the hand of God Himself. But, I figure a classy restaurant like this must know what they're doing, so I took a minute, breathed, and really noticed how they set us in front of a scene was far richer in color than the sunset would have been, and I believe the staff knew exactly what they were doing when they sat us in that table. Our table sat above the secondary dining area, and with our elevated seating we overlooked the blue pools, the yellow canopies by the water, the white walkways streaming through the green trees of the grounds, and the red roofs of Scottsdale shingling all the way to the canvassed sky in the distant horizon. The view was crowned with purple stormy skies of the evening, with two rainbows decorating the rain clouds illuminated and glowing by the waning sun. It was a everything you could ask for... and it all eventually left us for the night.  Overall, we loved it. She loved it. It was the fanciest thing her or I have ever done in our lives.  After dinner we sat on the large balcony on cushioned benches warmed by the nearby fire, and watched the city lights twinkle in the distance, the planes flying into the night, the people below enjoying the pool. It was a relaxing way to top off a wonderful dinner.   And it was a memorable last night to end our time together, with everything you could ask for once again disappearing into the night.

Delicious food, cramped spaces, just like India itself!

Too long; didn't read: Best prices out of every other mechanic that looked at the car, saving me $2,000. New forever customer. They are the Costco of the mechanic world.  Lil Moes is an answer to prayers. And a stingy mans budget.  AC died in the middle of the Phoenix summer?  A rattling coming from my engine?   Both are terrible car problems to experience, and both happened at the exact same time to me just this past week. So I hop on Yelp, check out the best rated mechanics within 25 miles of Tempe, and give them all a call. I go from place to place in person looking for the best deal, and the top three gave me the exact same news:  "Your AC compressor has a leak, and with Ford, you need to replace the entire AC system: you can't just replace the compressor. That'll run you $1300. Also, the timing chain is worn, so we'll need to get into the timing housing: that's another $1700. When all is said and done you're looking at $3200."  Three thousand, two hundred big ones, you say?  "Yup. By the way the rattling means the car could die at any moment: I'm actually surprised you've been driving this long."  I would say I'm lucky, but 3200... maybe I'm not Vegas lucky after all.  With three different mechanics giving me the same price each time I was sure I was screwed. I'd either need to drop three grand to fix a car that's worth $4500, or sell to someone on Craigslis who wants a fixer-upper and then jump ship with these Labor Day deals. Either way I went, I was in for a lot of hassle, and a lot of money spent.  And then, as the clouds parted and a silver lining broke, a Hail Mary pass from heaven itself comes my way.  Paul, owner of Lil Moe's, picks up the phone, hears my woes, and says, "I can do the AC for $500."   Deal.   I come in, drop off my keys, bail.  He calls back, "actually, it's not what we thought. There's actually no leak, regardless of what the other mechanics said (and charged me for to test). It's an electrical problem, meaning if all the other mechanics replaced your entire AC then it wouldn't actually fix the problem... because the AC isn't getting power. We'll need to fix the compressor clutch, also. That said, final price is $390."  Three hundred, ninety, you say? Paul I think I love you. "What do you think about the rattling noise."  "While it's definitely coming from the timing house, it's most likely just the tensioners. At highest point, it'd cost $850 with chain. Lowest? $770."  "So you're telling me you can fix both of my cars problems for less than the cost that every other mechanic wants to charge just for the AC?"  "Yup."  Paul and gang literally saved me $2,000. Whether I fixed the car or sold it and paid a $3000 down deposit, he saved me a few grand by troubleshooting the issue and spending time looking for the root cause. While the other mechanics wanted to replace everything and expect that to fix my problems, Paul spent time actually testing, assesing, and keeping track of what worked and what didn't.  "Used to be a bus mechanic. When a bus AC costs $10,000 to replace there's no way anyone is saying, 'just replace the entire thing.' You've got to troubleshoot the issue and find the exact problem."  And it shows: Lil Moe's Garage spent the time to find the problem, give me low cost estimates to fix it, and stuck to the estimates when the time came to pay up. No last minute fees, no hidden charges, no admin crap: just straight up labor and parts: the exact same prices he estimated from the phone call.  I'm actually moving here in a few weeks, but I'll make the drive to keep Lil Moe's as my go to mechanic. Period. The only five star review I have here on Yelp, and for all the right reasons:  1.) Personal touch to their service with how they handle customers 2.) Clean facility, offer water/gatorade 3.) Decades of experience 4.) Spend time troubleshooting the issue 5.) Explain exactly what they are charging for, dealer part pricing 6.) Best prices in town  If I had to nitpick like I was on one of those nitpicky chef shows, I'd say they could step up their phone came and keep me more udpated instead of me calling. But if that means they're using that time to find the root of the problem, that's a fair exchange, I'd say.  That said, they fully earned five stars and my business for as long as I'm in the valley. These guys went above and beyond. I have found my first mechanic that I'll call "my mechanic" (Raul is my hairdresser), and they have a life customer with me and my family.  All they need is a giant American flag waving out front and I'd petition Yelp to let me give Six stars.

Moved in beginning of the 2013 year. It's pricey compared to the other options in Tempe, but worth it. Nice location, looks impressive.   I'm condensing the pro's and con's into a list. Easier to read, less work for me.  1.) Pricey, but luxurious 2.) Pool/hotub is open all night. Ambient lighting. I did laps when it snowed in Tempe, so it is heated.  3.) Groundskeepers are friendly, keep the place clean. Still dog poop here and there, but that's the tenants fault.  4.) Pine trees bleed sap on cars near the southern wall. Don't park there. 5.) Staff is friendly, remember your faces and names and room numbers. 6.) To break contract it's 2 months rent is about $1300. Exorbitant prices. Standard, apparently. 7.) Footsteps in above apartments are loud, as are the slamming doors. Sounds like Donkey Kong slapping the ground on the occasion. 8.) On-Site security after hours 9.) Great sunsets paint the apartments  10.) Conveniently close to I-10, the 60, the 101, and the 202.  11.) Next to the Mill Centre, which has quaint little services and restaurants. "Taste of the Caribbean" is excellent. Walking distance, right across the West gate.  12.) Pools have only been dominated by parties a handful of times that I've seen. Usually sunbathers and a few families.  13.) Free wifi not the best 14.) Free printing.  15.) Fast hassle-free maintenance. Never had to fill out a form or explain myself. Just came and fixed/cleaned whatever.  16.) Lease renewal didn't charge/add an exorbitant amount. 17.) Windows don't cancel out much sound. If you live by a dumpster prepare to be woken up at 7am everytime they come by (twice or three times a week). 18.) Dumpsters can stink and ruin your balcony vibe 19.) Vinyl wood floors look swank 20.) West facing apartments have great views of the sunsets 21.) On-site gas grills are easy to use 22.) Near the Kiwanis Park on Mill: walk-able distance to the lake there. 23.) Near multiple fast-food places, three gas stations for your beer/gas needs 24.) Whole Foods is right there if you're into hippie high prices 25.) About a $11 cab ride to Mill Ave. 26.) Two sports bars close by, one of which plays UFC fights. Above-average bar food. No cover. 27.) The apartments are full of fullage: plenty of palm trees, yellow and red flowers, and just life everywhere. 28.) Not haunted.  29.) Jurassic Park gates out front are awesome.   Overall, happy with my move in, great location, great staff. Price is reasonable for everything you get, especially if you split the costs with a roommate. Like I said, I renewed my lease, no issues.  Edit: In response to that super negative review. This E.G has one review, doesn't state how long he's lived here, and his claim is vague, and attacks specific draws of the apartment by giving non-specific and very generalized problems.

Dirty bathrooms. Slow service. Took ten minutes to just get water. Here about an hour and twenty minutes total.   The food is good, but I don't think it all warrants the high four stars this place had. The owner is nice and polite, but the service is just slow to deliver and non-attentive.   The hooks area is a pretty cool spot. Wouldn't mind trying that area.

Took my vehicle in for an oil change. When I pulled up someone came to greet me, introduced me to the service member Amanda. She gave me a no run-around, all she did was look at the vehicle, tell me what she was going to do, then directed me to the waiting area. They do offer shuttle service, but the turn around time was so quick I didn't need it. In and out in about 20 minutes. The waiting area has all new leather chairs with big TVs, free coffee and hot chocolate, free cold waters, and free popcorn.   Everyone from the waiting area member to the cashier was very friendly. By the time I got my keys back I didn't have any extra bills, recommendations on what to fix next, just a smile and information on how healthy my vehicle is.  Definitely a step up from other dealers.  Will go here again.  Customer service alone is worth 5 stars.  No post-service car wash, otherwise it'd be a perfect rating otherwise.
