Dr. Underhill has been my primary care physician for several years and I will never go to another doctor as long as he is in practice here in the valley. He is very knowledgable, cares about his patients, and listens. I have never felt the rushed feeling which is normal when going to the doctor, he takes his time and ensures he is giving you the best care possible.

For the price you pay here, there are better sea food places around town that you can get a better over all experience for your money. We ordered raw oysters for an appetizer which was pretty good. I ordered a pound and a half of snow crab and my lady ordered a lobster bake with a cream sauce over linguini with mussels shrimp and scallops. Both of us were underwhelmed with the overall quality of the dishes we received for our main course. The corn and mashed potatoes that came as sides with my meal came out ice cold (seriously, cold to the touch) and the corn tasted like it had been boiled for days (absolutely no flavor to it) then soaked in liquified butter until it had the texture of pruning fingers. I have eaten crab A LOT in my life at many a restaurant and I can tell you for absolute certain that the amount of crab I received was not the advertised pound and a half. MAYBE a pound (two pieces of legs), which was disappointing. My lady said that her linguini was very overcooked (and it sure looked that way to me) so she stuck to the meat in the dish and didn't even eat the noodles. Our waitress was very good, and I tipped her very well, but it honestly was hard to enjoy the meal (over 100 bucks after it was all said and done) because the quality of the food was so disappointing. We are huge fans of Joe's Crab Shack and enjoy Pappadeaux as well, and only tried this place to try to save ourselves a drive (we live in Peoria). Next time we'll drive the extra 15 minutes. I am giving this rating a two star because our server was extraordinary, but the service did not make up for the quality of the food.

We've come here many times. Great sushi when they can get your order right. In the last 5 visits I have sent 3 orders back for being wrong so your odds of getting what you asked for right the first time aren't great, but they do a good job of fixing it for you. The music they play in here is horrible and on the weekends they have a house DJ playing a bunch of unintelligible crap that makes the dinner annoying, so we don't go on the weekends anymore. There are a couple (no seriously, 2 of them) waitresses who are good and have been there a while. The rest aren't very good. If you take a look at the management and then at the service staff, it is pretty obvious they were hired more for their visual appeal than their actual ability to wait a table. We lucked out tonight and got our favorite waitress here so no issues there. The alcohol selection is small, and drinks are way overpriced so don't come here expecting anything amazing from the bar. We do keep coming though because their sushi is all in all very good, just be aware of all the other crap that comes with it.

Food is usually pretty good here, although this time mine came out very sloppy all over the plate with my side sauces spilled. We were rushed by our waitress to get through out meal and pay even though the restaurant was nearly empty. We have eaten here several times and although the food is good, we have always had terrible service. For a 50 dollar meal it is not worth the treatment. There are better steakhouses in town with much better staff.

I have eaten here 100 times over the last two years, not kidding. The food is great! There are a few reasons I stopped going: 1, it is VERY overpriced. As in, you will pay 8 bucks for a burrito half the size of a chipotle burrito and 5 bucks for a street taco that you would have to eat 4 of to be satisfied. Don't get me wrong the food is good, but if I take my girl here we end up spending 30 bucks to go through a drive through for 2 people. Way too much money for fast food.   The second reason I stopped going was this: I also don't like the idea of being peer pressured to tip someone for handing me my food through a drive through window. It teaches unwarranted entitlement to a young person that they are deserving of tips for doing nothing tip worthy. It has happened to me several times here, and since I work hard for my money I don't like the idea of giving it to someone else for no reason just because they have their hand out and think they deserve it.  Now trust me when I tell you that I am not a cheapskate and I am a very good tipper. I enjoy tipping people who rate a tip and don't mind paying more for better products. However, this place is using a product pricing system and tipping system that is WAY above their caliber and status of restaurant.

Love this place. Mac Daddy and the Lady are my two favorites. Try one of the local brews with your meal while you're at it!

Excellent food. Owners are very friendly. They are going to have to expand cause there just isn't enough room anymore with their growing popularity.
