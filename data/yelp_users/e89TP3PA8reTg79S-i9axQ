My fianc√© and I booked Allegro Quartet for our wedding  in Sedona on 7-13-13. We decided on a cello and a violin, and Karen and Priscilla were our musicians. Their communication throughout the planning process was excellent, arrival on site was prompt, and their performance was truly a class act. I would highly recommend Allegro Quartet to anyone looking to add classy live music to their event!

Love the fresh steamed broccoli and chicken at this place! The food is always piping hot and neatly packed up when I pick up my to-go order. Food is always ready fast.  The owners are sweethearts too :)

Always great service with a smile, which is rare these days. Gary and the guys always do a wonderful job from start to finish. Very customer oriented and never try to upswell, oversell, or rip off customers. Been going there for 8+ years and will continue to be a patron and recommend Thunderbird Automotive to others.

Food was some of the best mexican I've ever eaten, expecially the chicken enchiladas.  The atmosphere was very cramped, and the torn vinyl booths were very disappointing.  I would go back for the food.

Wow what a fun discovery! This place has over 20 wonderful beers on tap at all times. The variety is amazing. With IPAs, Heffeweizens, porters, local, imported, and more. Love doing the sampler of 4 [or 8 :) ] Food is a mesh of unique and comfort classics, pizza is cooked in a little brick oven. Always delicious!

Best Mexican cuisine in the area! I've tried many menu items, and they were all delicious...rolled quesadilla, guacamole, ensalada grande, pollo especial, carne escada, etc. everything was fresh and delivered to the table quickly.  The specialty margaritas are refreshing, flavorful, and unique. Great service every time, especially from the bartender, JC.

Wow! I've been going to the same sushi place in the Phoenix area for the past 6 years because it's the only legitimately delicious sushi place I found in this desert city...until tonight. Was in the Goodyear area and wanted sushi, but most places had crappy reviews, until YELP reviewers led me to this phenomenal establishment. I am both excited but sad to say that I have now found a new favorite sushi place... The Atkins roll was like nothing I've ever experienced before! I can't wait to come back!

This place should be the first stop on your way back from the airport especially if you are picking up visitors.  There really is no excuse to not stop there if you are anywhere within a five mile radius. The guac is scrumptious and chunky, but not overwhelmingly so. The carne asada burrito is bursting with the stuff dreams are made of...melt in your mouth perfectly seasoned carne asada with a little mini key lime wedge that is just begging to be squeezed.

Lame.  The menu was extremely disappointing (I think we may have been given the bar menu and not the regular menu, or maybe that's the only one they have?)  No drink menu either.  The salad was mediocre but nothing I couldn't have created on my own at home for less money.  The dressing was bland. The place was completely empty except for my table around 4pm...

What a hard-working crew! Reasonably priced, punctual, and friendly. I will be using LAS cleansing for my rental home investments as well as my own home. A top- notch, professional service. They also clean commercial property/businesses.  I would recommend the. To anybody!

Was here on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Throughout the course of the evening, I purchased an adult beverage at 3 different bars within the bowling alley. The beer  was flat and overpriced, and service was painstakingly slow. Management should hire more employees to help things run more smoothly and keep patrons happy and coming back.  The mixed drinks were overpriced as well, and food tasted stale (tortilla chips). Chairs were a little sticky, and empty bottles/glassware were left out long after they had been finished... I didn't see too many employees cleaning/wiping or bussing tables.  The atmosphere was lively and modern, and I liked the the layout of the entire establishment.  Will I go back? Definitely not to eat or drink. Maybe to bowl.

Maria is a very talented seamstress with impeccable customer service and very fair prices. I dropped off two dresses that needed to be taken in several sizes. She had them finished and ready for pickup in less than 24 hours! Her attention to detail and wonderful demeanor made my experience at her shop five-star worthy.  If you need clothing alterations of any kind, I highly recommend Ale Maria's.

Showtime: 7:40. Actual movie start time: 8:09 30 minutes of previews and commercials before the actual movie started. The longest commercial was an ad for the theater itself.  Ridiculous! Also, lots of kids and hoodlums hanging around outside and sitting on the floors inside. Too much of a teen hangout, with hardly a manager in sight.   I'm sorry I strayed from my usual Harkins, it was only because I had a free pass to the Digiplex!

A gem of a restaurant!  Beers and specialty drinks are unique and tasty.  Food is simple and packed with a punch of favor.  My favorite is the street taco plate with one of each:  chicken chorizo, carne asada, and swordfish (!).  The guacamole is fresh and zesty, and the accompanying side of beans is a soft and savory addition to the tacos.  Happy Hour here is phenomenal, with the above mentioned dish (along with numerous others) at half price, and $5 beer pitchers and drink specials!

This is my 3rd time here. The first visit was on a Sunday afternoon.  The brews were delish and the food was nothing special (ploughmans platter and sampler).  The second visit was after work on a Friday and the service, food (north mountain burger), and beer (Belgian) were great. 5 stars for that night. Tonight, however is a completely different story. My brother in law chose North Mtn for his birthday dinner destination, as he normally has a good experience here. We waited NINETY MINUTES (plus!) for our food. My 'Caesar' salad was literally a plate of lettuce. No croutons (the menu description had croutons listed as an ingredient),  and no Parmesan Romano blend cheese, just a plate of limp romaine with a breast of grilled chicken. We dined with a party of 12, and everyone's entree came out 10 mins apart. When bringing this to the manager's attention, she replied "I'll be right back" and never came back to check that these problems had been corrected. We asked the waiter for some bread (at this point it was 8 pm and out entire group was extremely hungry), and he brought out fried pieces of pita. No butter. No bread. Not even a soft pretzel ( one of the menu items).  All of our water glasses were empty as well. What a waste of time and money! Still waiting for the check too!  We asked for it THIRTY mins ago...

I'll give this place 5 stars because I read the other reviews and I think people are way too picky and get a little too serious about their nails! It's supposed to be a relaxing, pampering experience...just relax a little and let the nail tech do their job without critiquing every little detail! I am just finishing up my 'luxury' pedicure with Ann, and it lived up to its name. Very luxurious and relaxing. I'd come back!

Delicious, affordable, fresh food in a very relaxing atmosphere. The lunch specials are a nice sized portion and the staff is very friendly, personable, and accommodating. Love sitting on the patio and with a pool view and listening to the waterfall. Fun activities like Veterans Day lunch, Wednesday night Karaoke, and more. Full bar with modestly priced drinks and beer. What a great place to dine and unwind for breakfast, lunch, or dinner!  Cant wait to come back again!

After several weeks of wanting to try out Dubina, I finally met up with a friend here on a Friday evening. We both wanted to sample the beers, so we ordered the flight.  Three out of the five were IPAs (not my favorite, but I wanted to be open minded and give them a try), the other two samples were Heffs. Keep in mind that I am by no means an expert in beer, but the whole flight was not very good overall, too bitter in my opinion, and the 'carrot cake' Heff tasted very basic without a hint of the carrot cake that I was expecting.  The atmosphere inside the brewery was lacking, just a large open room with tables and chairs, a bar area, and some booths off to the side. Nothing special.  Especially on a Friday evening, some live, or even livelier music on the radio, would have added a little something more to the bleak atmosphere.  The food smelled good (although we didn't order any). I'm glad I got to try this place out, but wouldn't go back.

Today I had my first experience eating Indian food and I can definitely say that it will not be my last! I can also say that I will make sure to come back to Saffron next time I need my fix...it was absolutely fantastic!! We ordered the lamb tikka masala (medium hot), chicken tikka masala (medium hot), (2) garlic naan, (1) rice, and (2) mango lassi. The sauce was phenomenal, meat was tender and savory, naan was soft but crisp in all the right places, and bursting with garlicky goodness. The sweet creamy lassi's were a perfect compliment to the heat. The staff was very pleasant, knowledgeable and welcoming. Portions were great for the price ($35 total). We've even got leftovers for later! Can't wait to come back!

This place has a lot of potential, and I truly hope the franchise owner of this location reads and responds to my review. The smoothies are flavorful, refreshing, and nutritious, but the service and staff are a major downfall. I count 5 staff members on duty, and only one is actually making smoothies (his name was Josh, and he was very friendly). I watched customers walk in and not one staff member standing at the counter even acknowledged them.  Very disappointing.

What isn't to love about this place? I have been a patient of Dr. Mark Hughes since 2010, after neglecting to go to  dentist for years because I was apprehensive about what work I may have needed done.  Dr. Hughes and his lovely staff have been taking care of my 6 month cleanings and dental exams since then, and I recently became an orthodontia patient of his as well! The care I receive there is nothing less than spectacular...from the friendly smiles that greet me as I walk in, to no wait times in the lobby, to early office hours that accommodate every schedule, to the crowns made SAME DAY in office (yes, that's right, no temporary crowns here!) to the fresh tooth feeling after a cleaning, to the precision and expertise of my invisilign treatment, this place has it all. If you are looking for a new dentist or orthodontist, or are new to the area and need to get established as a patient, I highly recommend you stop reading this and call Dr. Hughes' office now. You'll be smiling brighter after you do!

Great job to the staff here for making it a welcoming, reasonably priced, relaxing establishment. I felt like the tech took his time and was very pleasant and personable. He fixed my jacked-up big toenails with acrylic too :)
