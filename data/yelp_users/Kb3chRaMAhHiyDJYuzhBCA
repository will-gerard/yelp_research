Gate C has to be the worst gate I have ever tried to pass through....horrible slow service and the TSA agents do not care if your handicapped or having a heart attack......they just ignore you....this gate takes the " Hurry Up and Wait " to another level.....still trying to get through the x-ray part 1 hour later.....not kidding.....I feel sorry for the First Class people who paid more money to get through the line faster....when they too have to wait....there must be about 20-30 people waiting to check into 1 st class....something seriously needs to be looked at in this airport!

I have to say...why would you take a signature item your known for off the menu completely? Their menu dies still advertise them but the cashier told me they no longer have the rosemary potatoes. I am very disappointed they no longer serve the rosemary potatoes.....they now serve horribly crispy hash browns. This makes this place no more special than Denny's.  I gave them 2 stars cause they do have big screen TV's and nice temorate A/C.....otherwise I would have given 1 star.

Ate at this place last night...Miso soup was good....Vegi Noodle dish in beef broth was horrible....this place is way over priced...I will not go back again.

Very dissatisfied......althought I am a single and its not hard to get a seat in the bar....I came in sat down and a nice waiter did ask me what I wanted to drink....served ne my first beer without asking if I acted to taste test it first....another weird thing about this guy is he smiled a lot...maybe too much and failed to ask me if I was eating. I flagged a waitress down about 15-20 minutes later and ordered a burger well done....when it came it was medium rare....the mash potatoes are supposed to taste like garlic....they didn't.....atmosphere is typically bar....I do not think I will return.

Walked right in...sat at the bar...instant service before my flight....waited about 5 minutes or less and my basic breakfast was right in front of me....along with this absolutely awesome butter that had orange grinds in it I used to top my English muffin.....friendly staff and perfect mimosa!

It's weird that you have to check in even for the bar....but it's helpful because it's so popular that it's hard even to get a bar seat. So far everyone has a great attitude and ate very friendly. Very tasty mimosa's. ..cheers!

I walked in and was immediately seated at their bar.....had I wanted a table it would have been 1 hour....most likely due to church peeps and everyone wants to try a new place out. Service us very friendly and prompt. I had a large OJ which was fresh squeezed....and the water is delicious. ..you can taste the cucumbers. Only thing missing was  mimosa's....still getting their liquor license approved.  I had the crepe's which inside was eggs, spinach and some cheese.  The dish is to have mushrooms but I substituted tomatoes which was delicious.  I ordered a side of bacon and only was able to eat one crepe out of three because it was so big. I definatily will come back after a few weeks of them settling.
