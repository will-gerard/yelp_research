I recently moved in to a newly remodeled apartment. It has nice wood flooring and an attached garage. I did not want an apartment without a garage so this was ideal for me. The kitchen looks really sleek with stainless appliances. So far, so good. I do not have any issues with neighbors and the few times I had to go into the office, the employees were really friendly. I still have not tried out the pool or gym, but they are adequate for what I would need. I would recommend this apartment complex. They have decent prices for this North Scottsdale location.

I would often times pass by this place heading to get a protein shake from One Stop Nutrition which is basically next door.  The food would always smell terrific, and the patio was always bumping.  The wife and I finally decided to check it out on a warm, beautiful Arizona night and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  Our server was laid back and friendly, the food was healthier than most food  places and the quality was pleasant.  Prices are decent as long as you don't get wine like my wife and I did.  Was really impressed with this place and will be going back.

First impressions are always the most critical, and my first experience with this place was a bad one.  A group of friends and I came into the place and sat down at a table.  There was about 5 people at the bar and a female bartender.  After waiting 15 minutes with absolutely no one helping us, I came to the realization that the seating area was probably closed but the bartender who looked at us at least 5 times failed to mention that, or even acknowledge that we were there at all. Not even a "hey guys, the dining area is closed, I can help you up here at the bar."  She just watched us sit there twiddling our thumbs.  There wasn't room for all of us at the bar either as we had about 7-8 people in our party.  We were maybe 20ft from the bartender and in crystal clear view to her.  As we got up and left because of not being served, she didn't even say anything as we headed to the door. Absolutely poor service from her!  Maybe one day I'll go back and if they impress me, I will certainly change my rating of this place.  The owner contacted me and apologized, but couldn't you throw me some coupons or half off my order or something to attract me back?  I mean the service was an actual joke, I WANTED to spend money in your establishment but your workers didn't want to take it.  Now to find out its a Seahag bar??....That's all this state needs is another bar full of bandwagon fans that don't support the local teams.

Not sure how I feel about Danny's anymore.  I have had some positive and negative experiences at this location, but my experience today was pretty lame.  These guys need to know that the constant, almost harassing upselling is turning people off.  I have resorted to the Costco car wash for my last dozen or so car washes just because I didn't feel like getting haggled to death.  I don't know how these guys could work like that, I could never bug the living crap out of someone for an up sale, that is why I have always stayed clear of such professions, but to each their own.    You really need to watch these guys do the work you paid for.  This is the second time I have upgraded to an interior detail which was not completed.  The first time I had my truck and I upgraded to an interior detail only to get my truck back and the inside was just routinely cleaned in terms of a basic car wash.  There was no seat scrubbing or in depth interior detail that I had paid for.  So I talked to them about it and they agreed to scrub my seats, but I had to continue to wait.  Today I ordered a VIP car wash and I decided to upgrade to the leather seat detail because they haven't been cleaned in a while.  Same thing happened, I get my car back and the seats were not conditioned, so I had to bring it over to the detail section and continue to wait.  I know I am not alone in my logic here, but when you pay for a service, you should get that service.  You really need to watch these guys like a hawk and make sure you are getting what you paid for because from my experience, there is a 50/50 chance you will not.  The wash quality itself is decent, but for whatever reason these guys will not clean out cup holders and I have no idea why.  I'll sometimes have straw rappers and other obvious pieces of trash in my cup holders and they will not discard.  I understand not wanting to throw away business cards, sticky notes etc but obvious pieces of trash such as wrappers should be discarded and the cup holders should be wiped out.    I don't know if I am going to go back to Danny's.  The constant harassing to upgrade and so-so service is not appealing anymore.

More than helpful, they helped me out tremendously fitting my watch that I did not even buy there.  I can only imagine how they would be if you purchased jewelry from them.  If I have to purchase jewelry in the future, Ganem would be a great place.

*UPDATE*  After I had my initial disappointing experience at this location I was told to contact the store manager and I decided to give them another try.  The new manager Mike was genuinely interested in the past experience I had and wanted to rectify the issue.  I appreciate the service that he showed my family and I.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  Our server was also fantastic.  It seems like they have completely worked out any issues they had, which is to be expected in a new restaurant.  I would definitely recommend this location, top notch.
