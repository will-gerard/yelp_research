Everything was very good here. We had a combo of pho, fresh rolls, and rice plates and it was all so good. Finally, I have found a place near mesa that I would come back to. Being from Seattle, it's hard to find good Asian good in this area!

I give this place 2 stars because it was incredibly average. I loved the ambiance, the attentiveness from the staff, the cleanliness. All those things were great. But when it comes down to it, I just want a good wax. The gal who did mine was super friendly, very nice. But again, I just want it done right. She had missed a few hairs, so I had to go home and shave. I also got a brow waxing and the shape is exactly what I came in with. I even advised the front desk when I set the appt, that it was important I have someone who can shape brows. I'm not saying I wouldn't go back, I'm just saying it wasn't a great wax. Everything else was awesome.

I can't say enough great things about this place. My husband and I came here for dinner on NYE and the food and service were top notch. It's a traditional steak house w many sides to choose from. They will even allow you to do half portions of the sides so that you can try many! We had the crab cocktail, shared a Caesar salad (the Caesar is huge, plenty to share between two people), the chop ribeye, and multiple sides including garlic mashed, onion rings, saut√©ed mushrooms, asparagus and mac and cheese. All of it was amazing.   Here is my tip: if you're getting a salad, share it. Get the half order of sides so you can try multiple.   And yes, when the waiter suggests the butter cake for dessert, oblige.

I was surprised about this place. I would highly recommend it! Coming from Seattle and the Bay Area, I know good pho! The broth was not greasy, but super flavorful. The beef and noodles  were good too. We also had the veggie stir fry w beef, chicken and shrimp. Very tasty sauce!

I think I may have gone on a bad service day, but the food was ok. We ordered phad Thai, snow peas w broccoli and spring rolls. The spring rolls were probably the worst I've ever had. The skin was so soft and sticky, it was packed so full of noodles, that it just fell apart at the first bite. I wouldn't recommend these at all. The phad Thai was ok, but a little overly sweet, which seems to be the norm around AZ. So maybe people like it like that? Maybe they've never had it the right way? We also had snow peas w broccoli, in a garlic sauce. The sauce was completely flavorless. AgAin, besides the spring rolls, everything was ok...just wouldn't go out of the wAy to come here again.

Went on a Saturday thinking they would have high turnover and a lot of options. Wrong. It was clean and friendly enough, but the options were incredibly limited. Granted being from Seattle and being spoiled by great dim sum doesn't make it better, but I definitely won't be back to this one. Very disappointed in the variety.

The food we ordered was very tasty! We got the artichoke crab dip, side salads and pepperoni/sausage/mushroom pizza. My pet peeve is when the sausage has too much star anise in it, but this was perfect; a lot of bite to it, super flavorful. The service was fast and nice, all good!

This place was great; didn't look like much from the outside but you get inside and the service was great, and the food really tasty.   We ordered the hot and sour soup. It was a little gelatinous for my taste, but it was extra hot, temperature wise, and that made it much better. I think I will try the pho next time though.  We also had the bbq pork chow mein, broccoli and beef, and spring rolls.  I wouldn't recommend the fried spring rolls...very greasy. I saw another table w fresh rolls and those looked better.

Nothing fancy as far as decor, but nice enough. Right next to albertsons so you can even grocery stop afterward.  We came here based on the excellent reviews so we had high hopes. We ordered the fried spring rolls, chicken pad Thai, red curry, and broccoli lover dishes.   The spring rolls were ok. I think next time I will be ordering the fresh ones though. So if you're deciding between the two, pick the fresh ones.   The broccoli lover was amazing. The pad Thai was sweet, and although I'm not a fan of sweet pad Thai, the consistency of the veggies and noodles and the fact it was saucier than most, I was a fan. I added a spoonful of my curry over the pad Thai to cut the sweetness a bit.   Overall, good food. Nothing super special, but consistent and tasty. And sometimes, that's what Us customers really want.
