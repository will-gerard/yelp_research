I don't even know where to begin...I absolutely LOVE Premier Fitness Systems and training with Brandon Harris. He is absolutely amazing and he is stuck with me for a long, long time.  After working with him at Premier Fitness, I can't even imagine going back to my old routine.  I am a busy mother of 3 young kids (4, 6 and 10), wife, business owner, room mom, advocate for a domestic violence shelter, etc. etc. ... and I would not miss a chance to train with PFS and Brandon.  I am in the best shape of my life and have never felt better (my first month training at Premier Fitness Systems resulted in a 3% body fat reduction).  My husband and I have been training for years and were bored with our workouts and the scenery at our gym,  It took Brandon and Premier Fitness to make it fun again and to help take us to the next level.  He challenges us in ways that we never were able to do on our own.  Each workout is different and exciting (I'm using equipment and doing exercises that I could never do on my own) and I always leave there feeling like I just accomplished something big!    Lastly, It's great to train and have my workouts just be about me without the distractions at the large national gyms that I've always gone too. I get there and from the moment I walk in the door, it is me and my workout... nothing else!  I encourage anyone looking to take it to the next level, accomplish any fitness goal, make working out exciting again, lose weight, look your absolute best, etc. to call Premier Fitness Systems.

Absolutely horrible! Overpriced express wash, it was $12 and I think is the worst express wash I've ever had. My windshield wipers operate on a sensor and went off during the wash and 1 broke. Rather than the trainer being willing to help or at least be nice, he was rude and couldn't have cared less. There was a nice man than helped me untangle them but I will never go there again!
