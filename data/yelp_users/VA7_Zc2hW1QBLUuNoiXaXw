I'm very lucky to live right across the street from here. I think this is the local favorite when it comes to Napolentana style pizza. Bianco can stay with the tourists. I love coming home from work and smelling the wood burning from the brick oven, walking over and having an expresso at the bar or finishing the meal with an amazing limoncello. The staff are great people and the ambiance is second to none. The gnocchi is on special on Tuesdays and is absolutely to die for. Great and impressive date night.  And they have a pet!

This was the first restaurant I became a regular at when I moved to Phoenix 3 years ago. I love this place, my heart will always have it. Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is great. From the garlic mashed potatoes with cheese, to the vegetarian pasties to the P,B, and J pasty, it's all great. The employees are all helpful and extremely nice. A perk for me, is that I get to sit at the bar and watch my food get prepared. I love that. Great for lunch and especially great to pre-party before going out on Mill.

I came here for a friend's birthday party and decided to show up a little early to get a feel for the place. I sat at the bar and the two bartenders held great conversation and had lots of fun with the patrons. I came during happy hour and was blown away. At least for happy hour, the prices were phenomenal for what you get. They had multiple flavors of limoncello, which I'm a sucker for. There food was top notch. I recommend this place for groups or date night dinner. I absolutely loved the projector showing old black and white movies, a great touch.

I wanted to write a real review of this place. Gallo Blanco is probably my favorite restaurant thus far. Their street tacos are exceptional, the plain house salad has been reinvented and turned to something phenomenal. The melon-made Agua Fresco is fantastic, I took mine with a little tequila and triple-sec. Also, make sure you get guacamole on everything. I recommend this place to absolutely everyone for any occasion. The employees are great, lively and just fun people, from the manager to the dishwasher they were all extremely friendly.

I live right down from the street and you this place might possibly be the best brunch place in all of Phoenix. Their modern take on the food they serve is delicious and adventurous. From the house to the absolutely amazing patio, you can't miss at this place. The employees and owner are great people that are always there to serve you right when you need them. The only problem I have is that their drinks are as expensive as their food. They do use mostly top shelf liquors.

I really liked this place. The wings were great, my burger was amazing and the fact they ask you how you want it cooked, and they cook it that way! Happy hour is of course your best bet to save a little, but they have top notch wines and spirits. So they're prices are justified. If they have a sommelier, they have done a great job and so has the chef. I liked the ambiance too. It was like being in a basement bar on the first floor. Great for happy hour or special night with the guys or ladies if you really like sports.

This place was an utter disappointment. I walked in around 11-11:30 when they should have been prepping for the lunch rush. The tables and floor looked like they hadn't been cleaned since the night before. The food was pretty bland. The person wearing the chef coat took our order, he was sick. Coughing everywhere, handling the cash and not once did I see him was his hands. Luckily he was not preparing our food, but nonetheless it was pretty disgusting. Stay Away!

I've been here 3 times and it has never faltered once. Great food at great prices, and an exceptional staff. I love the Windsor Burger with the saut√©ed carrots and Barrenjager on the rocks. What a beautiful mix. I suggest this for anyone on any occasion

I came here the friday after Christmas with an intimate group of friends, and I was absolutely smitten with the place. The owners were fantastic, the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.   The food was impecable, the drinks were great and basically personalized to taste. We all sent our drinks and food around the table a couple times. We enjoyed the 3 way bruschetta (you can't go wrong with any, as long as you love cheese!),  portebello and balsalmic pizzette, ,pesto and shrimp pizzette, the lobster mac and cheese, and the rabbit ravioli. Dessert included cherry bourboun icecream/smoked porter float, and the chocolate bread pudding. Drinks were many, and merry. The deconstructed coffee was a table favorite though, I highly recommend it! An A++ place, and I bet with happy hour, it's not even worth going anywhere else! It's really nice to enjoy a chef owned restaurant in a part of town that is riddled with corporate establishments.  Go and try it! You will not be disappointed! Do it now!
