Just left after a refreshing stay. My husband and I have been here before, and come back because we enjoy it. It is a special spot for us. The rooms are nice, I always sleep through the night on their wonderful beds, with the blackout curtains shut! The front desk and concierge are always extremely friendly. We love the pool and lazy river which has a swim up bar (perfect ;) This round, I visited the spa for a massage as well, where the staff was also very welcoming. We always try to make time for ourselves to stay here when we come to visit family. .............  The one drawback: the attendants or valet guys. I wouldn't quite know what to call them, because we were not acknowledged by them a single time as we entered and exited the lobby. They are still the first and last impression.  Are they supposed to greet you? Offer to bring up bags? Ask if you have a ticket for valet? Look up from their desk? We didn't mind when we first walked in, because we were so excited to arrive, but it became off-putting after each time we came and went. The stay would have been perfect, but to keep guests coming back, wouldn't you at the very least want them to say "hello" and "goodbye"? Or better yet, for true hospitality, "we'll see you next summer" instead of being huddled in a circle, drumming on the desk, chatting with each other, and ignoring the guests? I wouldn't necessarily say it ruined our stay, but this being "our special place" we would like to leave with the same sense of happiness as when we arrive.

I love AJ's! They offer so many unique products. Their sushi bar is pretty good for a quick sushi fix, and they have specials each day. I do wish they offered a little more organic produce, and at times it isn't always the freshest, being in small supply. I like that pretty much anything you can pick up in here, you can buy. It's just fun to browse, and you can always find something.

Tried out this office today based on positive reviews on Yelp. Here's my take:  I called ahead about if there was an "exam charge." To give some background, we moved here from Las Vegas where my vet office never charged a fee for the exam. The office we were using here (white tanks) charges $50 just for walking in the door, which is why I started looking elsewhere.  We brought my dog in for boosters. It was $48 for distemper/parvo/exam and $20 for bordatella shots. Much more fair pricing (they combined a smaller exam charge with the first booster, though I'm not sure how it breaks down).  That being said, this is a no-frills office. I think those exam fees go into making other vet offices more boutiquey, as a previous reviewer has mentioned. This doesn't lend to animal care, it just entertains us pet-owners.  This is a small office with 2 exam rooms. Seems like an older building, and a little wear and tear is obvious. A little smoothing around the edges wouldn't hurt, but again, they're not charging what other clinics are.  Both doctor and receptionist were super friendly, and we were in and out, quick and easy. Pending any moves in our future, we would return!

Calling all moms:  This target has an impressively large selection of organic baby foods and snacks in comparison to other locations I've been to. It was so refreshing to see more than 1 brand, this had at least 4 (Ella's Kitchen, Earth's Best, Plum, Happy Baby, and probably more). If only they carried Babys Only formula! Still have only ever found it at Whole Foods. They also just had a lot of other really cute random baby things that I have not noticed in other locations from particular outfits to bibs to on-the-go dining items. I really loved the infant/toddler section, I was impressed!  I also dropped a prescription off prior to shopping. First, let me say Target pharmacy blows CVS and Walgreens out of the water (at least in my experience) in both selection and customer service. Kayla was super friendly and seemed knowledgable, and I think she is a great asset to the pharmacy.   Last mention: I didn't have high expectations when I came into this Target based on some of the people shopping in here (not to sound judgemental, but leaving empty starbucks cups on the shelves..COME ON people). But I left with a great experience!

If you don't want to read the rest of this review then just read this: spend your time and money elsewhere!   Tried this place out after all the mixed yelp reviews with an optimistic outlook. Sadly, my boyfriend and I were more than disappointed, we were embarrassed. We are both in the industry and try to be forgiving, but I honestly wish I had picked a different place to "treat" him.   Service was the absolute worst, with the exception of the assistant server, or possibly busser that offered the most presence at our table. He earns the star. OH, and the lovely hostess in the front, girl has potential for a much better restaurant,  what a warm first impression!   Our actual server forgot our drinks, which we didn't get until the main course, and we foolishly ordered 3 (appetizer, salad, main), which was the only course in which he happened to check back on us. As he had been taking our order, the manager was so unprofessional, he walked up behind him to tell him something as we're trying to order!   The food was bland and tired: fried calamari,  sad salads not worth mentioning, I got a ravioli dish that I'd rather forget,  and the osso bucco that my boyfriend ordered may have been good, but I honestly can't remember beyond the rest of the experience.   I always feel such guilt after leaving a bad review, but I wish I had gone somewhere else.

3 things:  White Chocolate Grill, White Chocolate Brownie, White Chocolate Will.  Came in for an espresso and dessert to share with my mother-in-law at 12 noon on a Tuesday, and this place was buzzing! Huge lunch rush, yet we were promptly seated in Will's section. What a great guy! Service was fast and friendly, between him, the hostess, the busser, and the girl who took our drink order. The espresso was hot with a perfect lemon twist, and the brownie was so decadent!!! It had shavings of white chocolate sprinkled evenly over the plate in perfect thickness so as to melt on your tongue. Everyone was working efficiently, and again, Will really made our experience with his knowledge and personality. We'll be back!

The optic gallery is a great optometry office! Dr. Ka-Yan (who goes by Sandy) Cheung was really personable and sweet. She had a genuine conversation getting to know me before starting my exam. I had outstanding customer service with Kristy while selecting frames. She was patient and thorough as I took my time picking the right ones for me. The office has a large selection of frames to pick from with moderate to designer pricing. It is clean and well designed, being in the district.

AMAZING PET BOUTIQUE  The 2 brothers that work here are awesome. True animal LOVERS! We moved away, however they always remembered my dog by name, every time we came in. He loved looking around, drinking the water they have by the door, picking out a toy and a bully stick, AND peeing on their floor when he got too excited, which the staff was literally happy to clean up, though I usually offered to do it if they let me.  We got our crate for our pup here (just for training purposes, our guy can now be trusted to roam freely in the house when we are not home to watch his every move), picked 2 different dog foods from their vast selection. One is a dehydrated raw food, and the other is a "kibble" by PetCurian out of Canada, and is a healthy and reliable choice for dogs. We get treats, toys, shampoo, and even a probiotic for our burpy baby. The main ingredient: cheese. Naturally, he loves it.  Each time I left with my excited, social pup, large bag of food, purse, keys, plus bag of goodies, John assisted me out to the car, carrying my purchase for me. This was just outstanding customer service, and courtesy.  Any questions about products and what is best, this establishment can talk to you all day about anything pertaining to your pet. Happy people who clearly love their job. It was as much a treat for me to come here as it was for my dog. They get down on the ground and give the animals a legit belly rub and some scratchies behind the ears. Love it here.

I LOVE WEST ELM.  There is always a sale, always clearance, and always options on regular items.  I had a fantastic shopping experience with Michaela  (Makayla?) with blonde hair and glasses. She and the stock room employee (can't remember his name, maybe Jared) were extremely accommodating and patient, as well as friendly. They made shopping that much more enjoyable and satisfying.   A tip when shopping: go early in terms of when you  actually want the furniture in your home. Depending on what is in stock, you can wait 1-10 weeks for delivery, which is a huge window. But if you love it, like anything else, it is worth it!  This is the only location in the Phoenix area. So fun to browse, even when you aren't ready to purchase!

Baguette Cafe is always amazing. The owner is so sweet and remembers his guests. I like the family feel in this cafe, as he often mentions his wife, mom, and brother. Everything on the menu is gold: fresh-pressed juices, soups, pastries, but my favorite is the Acai Bowl, YUM. I've been many times, and will be back many more!

This is the best threading shop I've been to. I really enjoy the spa-like atmosphere. It's sleek and clean with nice music and smells like rose water. I've been going to this salon for a few years now, and have moved a few times between visits, and Rupa always remembers me no matter how long it's been. She does a great job. I've also been to Mina when Rupa wasn't in, and she is great as well. Know what you want when you come in, and let them know. I always tell the ladies I want to keep my eyebrows as thick as possible and to just clean them up. Love it here, wish I could bring this business with me whenever I move!

Finally!! A dental office I love! There is a reason Dr. Athari has all 5 star reviews. My husband and I both went to Pleasant Smiles, with seperate appointments. You are the only one in the waiting room, because you are the only one scheduled. Your teeth are actually examined and cleaned by the dentist himself, he doesn't just do a 2 minute drive by when you're done with a technician to say a generic, impersonal phrase on his way out. He is very thorough in his approach. My teeth looked perfect when I left, no more stains nor plaque between them, and there was no SCRAPING involved like at other offices I've been to. So easy, and painless, and as enjoyable as a dental appointment can be. My husband had all positive things to say after his appointment as well. Do yourself a favor, and end your search for an amazing dentist here.   Also, there are two TVs while you're getting your cleaning, one in front of the chair, and one above you on the ceiling. I got to see the top 25 most exotic beaches, awesome :)

5 pm today (Friday) and a long line with 2 tellers that worked through it super quickly!   HOWEVER not quickly enough before each of us were approached by an employee called a RELATIONSHIP banker who speaks to each customer 1 by 1 in line about why they are in the bank today. This location is small with tile flooring. Vanessa (I think was her name) was really nice, but this was extremely intrusive. She asked questions in a loud perky voice, and as a result everyone in line could hear your personal business. Her job is to make sure you know that there is an atm outside and online banking, and tries to shorten the line by sending customers to use these resources. And she tries to make it personal by asking personal questions. Bank of America this is extremely inappropriate. The lady in front of me (after I regretfully and awkwardly answered about 10 questions out loud, going into my method for paying rent and the fact that I'm moving and where and why etc) finally told her she thought this was weird and didn't feel comfortable explaining her business for everyone to hear. Why didn't I think of that? Ugh.   The 5 of us in line proceeded to discuss how odd and uncomfortable the whole experience with that was. No offense to Vanessa, but it was extremely offensive to us. I still feel uncomfortable.

We ordered a few items to go at the take-out counter after dining-in. We were helped by a young guy named Alex who was awesome!  I picked up some liverwurst for my husband and father-in-law and some cookies (rainbow, black and white) for me and my mother-in-law (you can see the difference in tastes here, ha).  I asked Alex what the best selling soup is, and he told me it was the chicken matzo ball soup. Something that is familiar, yet he described it in a way which made me realize it had been a while since I'd had any, and I've been thinking about it since! Guess I'll have to come back in for some!   Overall I had a great experience between dining in, the giant display case for deli and pastries, and Alex's service. He was funny, knowledgeable, and charming.   Can't wait to come back!

I ordered a large cheese for pick up at 2:30pm on a Saturday and was quoted 25 minutes but I'm almost positive they had to have given me a pizza that was already done for 'by the slice.' It was extremely stiff. Wouldn't go back, maybe I just got a bad pie.

I love Leone Cafe!  I'm living in Hawaii, but Las Vegas is home. And now that it's fall, I have a flood of memories of my favorite cafe. I wasn't the yelper I am today (ha) when I frequented this wonderful establishment, else I'd have sung their praises long ago. The atmosphere is just perfect. I love the food, the beverages, the staff, people watching, dog watching...I look forward to my next visit home so I can come enjoy a leisurely morning at Leone!

I want to like this place...but the staff has been so unprofessional twice now. I hate to leave a bad review, but they need to work on their attentiveness. I arrived this morning before my friend and while I waited for 10 minutes, I wasn't even offered water. Mind you, I was the only one in the restaurant aside from a couple at the bar. The two girls on staff were hanging out chit chatting which is fine but at least give me something to drink. Upon the arrival of my friend we waited close to 10 minutes AGAIN before getting up to leave, at which point one of the girls tried to come over with water. It was rude. I was really excited to finally try it, but there are plenty of other restaurants in town square who at least drop a napkin for you before ignoring you completely.

Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  If that is a noise, I'm kind of making it right now.  First of all though, our bartender tonight, a young guy, was so friendly, and genuinely nice. 5 stars for you.  Aside from that, it was happy hour (we arrived 9 pm ish), and we opted for sake bombs a la Kirin, and a major red flag went up for me when he pulled out the sake already poured, and apparently prepped, as it had saran wrap covering the carafe. Noooooo no no no. No!  Sushi honestly was kind of fishy, and we got rolls. The sauces and ginger slices didn't mask it.   I had a great time with my guy, and grateful for the moment, but definitely not on my list to return. This is amateur sushi. I'd come here if I was like 12, and just discovered what a California roll and mochi was, and didn't know any better. Sorry for the blunt review, but I have to keep it real! Thanks for the friendly service though!

Our server was very friendly and smiled the whole time that we dined.   We had the red velvet pancakes as a short stack which was plenty as these are very rich. So good! Very dangerous. I love huevos Rancheros, I always end up ordering them at breakfast places. I tried the green salsa, yum, and they had chicken as well. I do wish there were a liiiitle more beans on the plate. Overall good experience.

When I searched for THREADING on yelp, Leena was the only one to pop up. Having been threaded for the past 5 or so years now, when I saw her 5 star rating, that was all the info I needed.  SO when I entered the directions into my phone and pulled up to her home rather than a storefront, I was a little thrown off!   Leena greeted me when I knocked, telling me to feel free to walk in. The front room is just like a salon with a full wall mirror, and business card display. She was quick and friendly and did a thorough job. I was pleased with her service.   Thank you Leena, I will be coming back!

Just moved to Phoenix this year, and the first thing on my list to find was a salon. I found Salon D'Shayn on Yelp, and knew I wanted to see Sarah.  She cut my hair perfectly! I have been growing it out for the past year. I asked that she keep the length, but give me a little layering to give it some shape. I told her I didn't want framing around my face either. My hair looks exactly as I pictured. She gave me lots of information on the product featured in their salon, Neuma, and sent me home with some samples. My hair is super soft and has a glorious shine. She was really friendly, and I would definitely come back to see her again! Thank you, Sarah!

Great shop.  Customer service was wonderful. They take their time with your questions and interests, and seem to have good product knowledge.   I brought my dog in with me, and they showered him with lots of rubs, compliments, and treats!   We looked at some new harnesses, some treats, and just browsed the food. I was hoping to find Pet Curian dry food, but did not find it here. They have a huge variety of other brands, however.  They've been in business about 10 years. I've moved a lot, so in comparison to other pet needs shops I've visited, I'd like to see a little more variety in treats in here, specifically bully sticks. Also, the lighting is a little dull, brighter would be much friendlier. Minor preferences on my part, but a nice local shop!

We have been here twice. Our first experience was so enjoyable we had to come back, and Taco Guild has become a new favorite for us.  We met managers Justin and Garth who were both funny, knowledgable, and hospitable. I appreciated that they both visited the table to check on us, and get to know us.  I asked Justin about the history of the church, and what led it to becoming this restaurant. He really seemed to embrace the history of where this building has been, as well as its present, and where it is going. It was nice to hear that the former congregation has been supportive of the transformation. A lot of local memorabilia has been donated and is on display, including pews for seating. It is very community driven here from the decor to the draft list that is all from Arizona (I liked the Porter). The stained glass windows offer great lighting, and the atmosphere in general is vibrant and fun.  They have so many deals here. Happy hour M-F from 2-7, and 11-6 on the weekend. If you order 3 tacos, you get a side for free. They offer all you can eat tacos (I think on Mondays) DJ on Fridays, live music on Saturdays...  The first time we came was a Friday night, which is a louder, adult setting. Lots of fun. Our second time we brought kids at 5:30 on a Monday which was much more calm and quiet. They don't have a kid's menu, but they made us a chicken and cheese quesadilla, perfect.   Overall the food is flavorful served in good-sized portions at a great price point. The new Ono taco was my favorite with a delicious coconut slaw, and the grilled Romaine salad was filling and tasty with the shrimp.  Taco Guild is definitely worth checking out, and we will definitely be back!

5 stars for: food, drink, decor, ambiance, and Andy! First time meeting the owner but he was awesome. My friend that had an event at this restaurant introduced him and he was accommodating not only to her, but a lot of the guests. I overheard a lot of people calling out to say hello to him. I wish this place well, because it seems like everyone, staff and clientele are all happy in there.

Came here with a friend for lunch and really enjoyed ourselves. I'm pregnant at the moment, so I'm jealous that I couldn't partake in any wine sampling, and for that reason didn't tease myself by even looking at that part of the menu. I would love to come back after baby to treat myself!  That being said they were more than patient and accommodating as well as knowledgeable about their food menu for my dietary restrictions. We both ordered paninis, and were sad when we were finished,  because they were really good. They served them with a few thick slices of pickles, which I loved (duh). They served my friends wine in the bottom of an old wine bottle that was re-purposed as a glass, which was a nice touch.   I would definitely go back, cute, friendly, and good. Decor was nice too.

Yummy!!  Went in at 7pm on a Friday night, and it was slammed with a wait at the door. About 30 minutes, not bad.  Our table was really close to the table next to us, but this didn't bother me in the least. The atmosphere is really loud and fast-paced, with music going and conversation filling the whole place. People from the karaoke room even danced by in the dining area at one point.   My 3 favorites were I love my ass, Taste like my x girlfriend, and Screaming Honey which I think is a must-try. The salmon was perfect as far as temp and texture go for a fried item. I almost didn't order it, so glad I did, because it was my favorite!  I had hot green tea and my cup was never empty :) They walked around with the teapot with perfect attention. And it was only $1! For being as busy as they were, they were well staffed, attentive, and fast. The host, waitress, food runner, and busser, and maybe another server or 2 stopped by without being intrusive to check our table and clear and refill. Very good!   Definitely do AYCE, especially if you're with a few people. Prices are awesome. Would definitely go back.

So glad to meet this Dutch Mafia! I love this place!  All of the employees are so happy and cute and cool. It's just a great way to start your day with delish coffee and awesome people.   The cocomo and caramelizer are both really good and not overly sweet.   This place has 2 drive thrus, what?! And a walk up window. They are pumping it out. Love it!

This was my first time here. The portions are a good size, I got the Farmer's Market salad with chicken, and enjoyed it. The food and decor both are fresh and clean. They have a water station where you have an option for cold, room temp, or sparkling which was a nice touch. I would definitely go back. Very friendly service!

Met a group of 6 here, and had a comfortable corner to ourselves in their communal-style bench seating. Everything is made to order, very fresh. The eggs are organic, and they list the 3 farms they get them from at the bottom of their menu. Take advantage of this place before everyone starts coming and filling it up--though business was steady for brunch.  The people working here were super friendly and helpful, cleaning during downtime both on the floor and behind the counters.   They have a large coffee drink list, including pour-overs, and alfogato! I had the farmers breakfast which was a perfect portion. Enough to be full, but light enough to feel comfortable after finishing. I'm docking a star for the poached eggs being a hard poach. I would definitely go back for a healthy, satisfying, social brunch.

We love Musicology!  We are in the "walkers" session for my 14 month old son. A little shy, he always warms up to class after the first couple of exercises. By the end he is ready to keep dancing and playing. This is a great way to be social for baby and parent.   Miss Leah is so fun and sweet. She always calls out each child by name during class to tell them great job or point out fun dancing, etc. She keeps class moving at a good pace, and clearly enjoys being here. There are different themes depending on the week such as British Invasion (Beatles anyone?), and Broadway showtunes, to name a couple.  They also offer plenty of workshops. So far all that I have heard of have been complimentary. Each of them gages child development and education.  I would recommend to anyone! So glad we found Musicology :)

Wow!  I was set on Le Thai, because I already love it there, but so glad we came into Therapy for dinner last night to try something new. Here's what our party of 5 experienced:  The Food:  The good:  CHICKEN MEATBALLS - comes with 6, we ate them all, quickly. Tender and savory, I would order these again.   FIRE ROASTED CARROTS - the vanilla bourbon maple syrup was divine. And the feta. Perfect.  SHRIMP CEVICHE - the tomato lime sauce was just so satisfying, I actually was running my fork along my dish to get a few more final tastes when I finished. Well done.   THERAPY SIGNATURE SALAD - the red wine vinaigrette was very acidic, some found it slightly salty, but I enjoyed it. I would like to try the charred kale salad, but I am a sucker for granny smith, candied walnut, and bleu cheese combos..  The not so good:  IN THE "GNUDI" - maybe it was the truffle oil, maybe it was that it was our last dish. It was a miss for me.  HANGAR STEAK TARTAR - with the confit egg and herbs...kind of was like eating meat waiting to be rolled into balls..and I'm a fan of tartar and carpaccio in general.  The neither here nor there:  CAST IRON SMORES - eat it while it's hot. Pretty good, but not memorable.   The Service: it was slammed in here. Park across the street was having an event outside with a half pipe and some snowboards. The bar was in the weeds (we sat there for an hour waiting for our table). We sat for probably 20 minutes without even being greeted, let alone served. With a barback, 2 bartenders, and a runner, I felt like they could have done better with a little assistance from the manager. I saw him, he seemed to be of no help whatsoever. Not sure what he did aside from look around. He didn't talk to guests or step in to make drinks or run anything. Strange. In spite of that, they were clearly trying, and I have been in their shoes. No judgement here.   Our food runner was awesome. Wish I got his name so I could give him the good feedback. Very sweet person.  4 stars instead of 5 for the lack of help on the floor, but they did really well for being so busy. Great food, I would definitely return!  P.S. also, Manhattans are typically made with a swirl of vermouth around the glass, not a shot of it. Not sure if that was intentional. If so, this needs to be reconsidered.

We came for my nephew's 6th birthday party on a Saturday at 4pm.  Good stuff: The kids loved it, it's a great place to burn off some serious energy! They can have total free play, or the staff will announce group games over the intercom (like crab tag, I remember playing when I was a kid at day camp). The trampolines are awesome. So incredibly bouncy.  Other stuff: -some of the staff was kind of attitude-y. I would think this job is perfect for high schoolers, and anyone who enjoys kids, and high energy. Both one on one, and over the intercom, the tone was that of someone who is annoyed. I could hear the eyes rolling.  -the music was kind of inappropriate for kids. "The Hills" by the Weeknd??? Whoops. How did that make the playlist? Not saying that they have to play Zipity Doo Dah, but that is a poor choice. And I like the Weeknd..  -my sister-in-law paid for 2 hours for the party, and that only comes with 1 hour in the private party area, the other hour being for play. She seemed not to realize this, so not sure if this was clear when she reserved the area.  -prepare to fill out a lengthy waiver at entry on an iPad dock. Kind of invasive, email should be optional, not required. But I get it.  4 stars, because the negative stuff is what an adult is more aware of than the kids.
