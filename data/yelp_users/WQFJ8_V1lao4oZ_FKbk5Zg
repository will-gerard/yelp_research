Mi Amigos is one of my favorite Mexican Food restaurants for two simple reasons. 1. I love the chips & salsa and 2. They have my all time favorite chile relleno.  The Chips & Salsa Mi Amigos gives you some of the largest chips I've come across.  They are little half tortillas that are crisp and simple.  The salsa is heavy on the cilantro, but its chunky with good flavor.  I'm all about the big chunks of tomato in my salsa.  MY FAVORITE CHILE RELLENO I've been ordering this big beast of a relleno stuffed full of chicken for years.  The chicken inside is simply grilled chicken and its covered in some gooey cheese.  The pepper is a little bit random in heat - sometimes I sweat like a B while shoveling away, and sometimes it's rather mild. The batter they cook it in is different than most rellenos, its sort of crumby and dark, but delicious.  The sauce is some simple looking orange sauce with some sour cream in it - sorry, I can't cook so my skills in ingredient identification suck - I just know it's delicious!  My favorite.  I order it every time I'm there.  I visit this Mi Amigos every time I'm in the area looking for food.  I can't remember the last Arizona Center place I ate at other than Mi Amigos.  I have to have the relleno any time I'm near.

I love Einstein.  Fresh bagels are the bomb!  This Einstein is consistent with the others.  I think the layout is odd the way you have to enter and cross the store to start your order.  It's also a little cramped.  Most Einsteins are layed out better than this one.  Great location facing Papa John's across the street.

This Sunday afternoon I had an hour to kill while my daughter was at basketball practice so I searched for "Sports Bar" in my Yelp app.  Gallagher's came up and I was surprised.  I haven't seen on of these places in quite awhile.  I honestly figured the info was outdated, but it was the closest location to catch the Cardinals game...  What do ya know... it's here!  From the outside I figured it was dead.  One couple was on the patio watching a football game.  When I walked in though, almost every seat was filled.  I think every game was on TV or on many TVs.  I didn't count them, but I think they must have have 25 TVs.  The Cards game was on 25-30% of the TVs including the big screen in the bar.  So...  I grabbed the only booth I saw available and sat my butt down and ordered some chili and a coke.  The chili was pretty good.  It seemed to be better than a freshly opened can of Hormel, with more meat than beans and topped with onions and cheese.  Perfect afternoon snack.  The service was OK.  I got helped within a few minutes of sitting down and she checked back every few minutes.  My soda was delivered in a couple minutes and my chili came within 5.  I'll certainly come back here on gameday if I'm in this neighborhood.

My kids love this place.  It gets them hours of entertainment - rides, arcade, golf.  It's a little like going to the fair or a carnival, but some of it's indoors - important in the summer.  On our most recent visit, my 11yr old and I were wanting to play some video games. Originally we planned to go to GameWorks, but thats about 35 miles from us. Castles n Coasters is maybe 10 miles and the best arcade I know of west of I-17.    We started out with a round of golf since we were there.  I think $8 per golfer is a bit steep, but that's what I get for not coupon hunting beforehand.  We were bad and didn't keep score, didn't keep to one course and we had a blast on a relatively cool July evening.  We got there after 8pm on Wednesday night - it wasn't crowded at all - and they're open until midnight.    Apparently Wednesday nights are Unlimited Gaming nights. They have a DJ from 95.1 radio station (Latino hip-hop or pop?) and ran a $10 3hr block from 7-10pm where you can just hammer the arcade games.  Since we arrived late and golfed first we missed that boat. I will try and remember to come back on a Wednesday though.  Seems like a great deal for $10.  With our $10 we played a lot of pinball, air hockey and other arcade games.  Note: So many of these arcade games are old - like from the early days of this place.  Classic Donkey Kong and Tron games. Serious?  People were playin' them tho!  We've been here before and raced, ridden the roller coasters, the viking boat swing, bumper boats and pretty much everything they've had for years.  NEW TO THE PARK are a ZipLine and a Cable Climb or walk or whatever it is.  These are new and modern and popular.  Still no lines on a Wednesday night.  We've also been here on Saturday nights with a DJ. Those nights seem to draw the crowd associated with those radio stations.  If its not your music its probably not your crowd.  There have been times I've not enjoyed the music nor the crowd, but I have no real complaints.  Just not my music or my crowd.  The crowd can appear harder than a Scottsdale crowd, but this isn't in Scottsdale.  Knowhatimean?  It's all good - and safe.  I always see a couple officers on foot and couple more out in the parking lot.  Bottomline: after 30 years or so, this place is still a draw for kids of all ages.  It's not Disneyland!  I doubt it's even 1% the size but its the biggest amusement park in Arizona and its plenty of fun!

I LOVE SCHLOTZKYS!    There, I said it.  I don't know why these don't outnumber Quizno's and Subway. The bread and bread choices kick butt.  Can you get sourdough at those places?  How 'bout dark rye bread?  Any rye bread?  NO!  I try and stop by this or any Schlotzky's every chance I get.  I just wish there was one closer to my house (Arrowhead).

I've been eating at Souper Salads since the first appeared in Phoenix 15-20 years ago. I like that they're more affordable the some competitors.  It's pretty basic for seating and things but the salad bar is long and full of standard salad fixings. The salad here is usually fresh and I have no complaints at all.  My kids would eat here 3x a week if I'd let them.

This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.    I got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.  The place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week.

Good Mexican food.  Nothing noteworthy other than it was good. It's not my favorite but I'll stop in here again when in the area.  I got a couple beef enchiladas for lunch.  They came in a tin and the portions were good and the sauce was above average.  Simply a good lunch.

Gameworks is always a lot of fun.  I'd give it five stars but I think they've gotten pretty expensive - pretty much $1 minimum per game.  Some games are $2.50 or so.  The cost goes down per game if you buy a big fat ticket with bonus credits.  I dropped $30 on me n the 12-yr-old boy and we played for a couple hours - mostly shooting hoops.    Another thing - I miss my old games.  They used to have a bunch of old "quarter" games upstairs - classics like Joust, Galaga, Tempest and Burger Time.  Now there are many versions of fighting games.

I ate here for lunch because they are on my eScrip rewards list.  I wasn't expecting a dark bar... I ordered some chili and it was OK.  It didn't compare to the chili I ate a week earlier at Gallagher's.  The waitress helped me lightly - I asked for some crackers that were not provided automatically.    I may come back here - if I'm in a dark bar mood at lunch.  If so, I'll order something other than the chili.

I've been buying my dog food here for years - Canidae dog food for my active cattle dogs.  It's very affordable for a natural dog food.  All of my dogs have been on this food and they do very well on it.  Lamb & Rice is our flavor of choice.  The people at The Stock shop have always been extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  They always offer to carry my 40# bag of dog food out for me. They also have a frequent shopper program that gets me a discount on my 10th bag of food.  I just need to cut out the UPCs and bring them in when I've collected enough.

I went in for an oil change thinking this would be quick and easy.  Uhm... not so much.  It took her a much longer to check me in than I expected ~ 5-10 minutes ~ and then my van sat there for more than 20 minutes with what seemed to be a small team of technicians floating around.  Worst of all, I wandered away for a few minutes (ya, easy access to the evil store within) and when I come back I see the van pulling away.  HUH!?!?!?!!!!   I asked where the van was going and she said "not far".  Um... I DON'T THINK SO!    I went out side to see where it went and it was parked outside.  WTF?   I go back in, she hollers at tech person sitting in the office and he comes out and says "we had to decline it".  He said there's a dent in the oil pan and its right by the plug.  They cannot service it.  Well OK.  I cannot give you guys a good review.  You WASTED 45 minutes that I didn't have.  The oil pan is not their fault, just the lame, lazy attitude and overall waste of time is.  First and last time I go here.  Note that their basic oil change is $30.  I the same service plus a carwash AT THE DEALERSHIP for less than $30.  It's not as convenient, but its where I'm going from now on.

I'm very pleased with my experience at this Batteries Plus.  I needed a new battery in my remote alarm/key on my 04 Honda.  It was dead.  I dropped into this store on a Friday afternoon.  A couple people were in the store and I had to wait few minutes for someone to help me, he opened my key, replaced the battery and checked that it worked.  It took maybe 5 minutes and only $4.15, and I was back on the road happy as a clam. Again, I'm very pleased with these guys.

I'm not an expert on bowling alleys, so it seems fine to me - like 3 stars OK.  I gave them another star for the clerk behind the counter who was very helpful - she pulled out coupons for us to use with our group of 15. 3 lanes for 2hrs with pizza and drinks.  $40 per lane.  We got in more than 2 games each and I thought it was a good deal - $120 for 15 people.

This place drives me nuts!  It's very convenient for me to drop in and I'm mostly satisfied with their food, it's just that they are so slooooow in the drive-thru.  On my last visit I couldn't even order at the menu.  I had to roll up to the window and give my order.  It's not that the menu wasn't working, the gal just wasn't listening or hearing me correctly or something.  I had a question and apparently questions don't fly out at the menu.  When I got to the window and asked "can you leave a few fries w/o chili on them?" the look she gave me was complete bewilderment - like nobody had ever asked her a question before.  Frustrating.  I'll go here again because it's on the right side of the freeway, on my way everywhere.

My wife & I celebrated our anniversary here the other day. We came in with a two-meal coupon that got us two entrees, an appetizer and a dessert for $41.  Quite the deal considering we got enough food to each take home enough for lunch the next day and dessert for a couple days.  We picked out the Wagon Wheel sampler that has Crispy Fried Garlic-Pepper Zucchini (loved it), Chipotle-Buffalo Chicken Tenders (saved for next day), Loaded Potato Skins and Shrimp Cocktail. Everything was good but nothing was exceptional.  We wished the shrimp cocktail came with 4 shrimp instead of 3 (I got black eye going for the third shrimp).   My wife got the New York strip steak, baked potato soup and a salad.  She got her steak medium well, just like she wanted.  I blinked and her soup was gone.  She loved it!  I got the filet (which was a $3 upgrade), a loaded baked potato (no sour cream) and the potatoes au gratin.  I was very pleased with my medium filet and my baked potato.  The potatoes au gratin went home and were delicious the next day too.  For dessert we got the chocolate fudge cake that could have fed 4 or 5 people.  It had a little ice cream on it that we shared and then we took at least half of it home.  Bottomline - the food was good.  The price was good.  I have nothing to complain about and look forward to going back next time I get a coupon in the mail.

I was rather disappointed with our visit to Mimi's Cafe this evening.  It started out with our waitress introducing a second waitress who was in training, selling it that we'd have twice the help.  Truth is, we had less help than expected.  Service was pretty slow, but the bigger issue I had was with the ordinary food.    I ordered the roasted turkey dinner.  It looked and tasted like an upgraded TV dinner, only larger.  The slices were perfect like them came from the frozen package that way.  The potatoes were ordinarily and all I could think about during the meal was "Is this at all better than a TV dinner?"   It wasn't bad.  It wasn't good either.  It was simply  not what I expect from Mimi's - which is usually delicious.

Victory Lane has become my second home.  My son plays travel baseball.  He practices at Victory Lane, he plays in a weekly league at VL, and this Labor Day Weekend he played 5 games there in 3 days.  Compared to most ballparks Victory Lane is a standout with 6 ball fields, a club house and two snack bars.  The 6 ball fields are well kept "softball style" (dirt infields) with nice green grass.  Lighting at night is better than a city park.  No city run facility that I know of in the Phoenix area compares.  Compared to Big League Dreams some 50 miles across town, Victory Lane has only one clubhouse (instead of two) with less seating.  This means its harder to hide from the heat in the summer. The big difference though is the lack of pavement at Victory Lane.  This is one dusty place.  Other little things to note: Good: There's quite a few sand volleyball courts, the clubhouse food is pretty good, the view from the clubhouse is great, there's batting cages. Bad: Everybody pays $2-3 admission to get in even if on a league team, lines at the west snack bar are ridiculously long, the shade has improved over the years but the covers are still less than 100%.  This is the best ballpark north and west valley, but it could be better.

One of my favorite theaters.  They seem to up on the latest technology.  The place is always clean.  And it's across from Krispy Kreme; what else could you ask for? I generally I prefer Harkins over the others in town, in part because they are rooted here in the valley, but I like there frequent viewer program with the simple cup and T-shirt to get free popcorn and $1 sodas when we visit. I used to frequent AMC because of their program, but now you have to pay to join that.  Not OK with me.  I'm sticking with Harkins!

This Jack in the Box is sub par even for JitB's.  The line is usually slow and the placement in the parking lot makes it accessible only if you're traveling East on Bell; otherwise it's a lot of parking lot to work through to get to it.  You gotta really want JitB.

THIS PLACE IS small. REALLY REALLY small.  Good thing theyr'e planning to build a new one.  I got take out and drove 20 minutes back to work.  Not Good.  My stomach was growling at me - loud enough I could focus on nothing else.  They gave me melted butter, hot sauce & syrup with my chicken & waffle.  I'm so full right now.  Fat & Happy.  Very very happy.

I'm still pretty irritated with Home Depot a week after my multiple trips to get a new deadbolt and re-key.  The first couple guys were helpful, but again I got a deadbolt that didn't fit in my security gate.   The first time I tried this a few weeks ago I bought an upgraded Kwikset deadbolt that wouldn't work on the thin security door.  The bolts were too long to pull the two locks tight on the door.  I had to return that one and didn't have time to do another re-key.    Last week I got the new deadbolt home and it didn't have the problem I had before, now the mail locking bolt was too thick.  The design was different from old one.  It had some stupid twist thing so it could adjust it's length, so... back to the home depot.  It wasn't even 30 minutes later but the first guys were gone and a less knowledgeable helper was in the locks & keys.  I asked for help and he tried to refer me to security door specialist store.  SAY WHAT???  I started looking at the bolts on the shelf.  I saw a kit with just the bolt assembly and it looked thinner.  He didn't think it was but I found a previously open package that we dug into and compared.  Yep, this one matched my deadbolt that fit.  So... I know more about deadbolts than the guy working at Home Depot.  This shouldn't be.  I do marketing for a living.  I've changed a few door knobs and dead bolts over the years, but I'm no expert.  I shouldn't have to help myself at Home Depot.    HD still gets a couple stars because they're not always this lame.  Still, I haven't had a  good experience at this location in awhile.

I love Souper Salad!  It's not as awesome as some of the other salad joints, but its half the cost as many of them and it's got all the regular items I expect - two lettuces, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. plus 3-4 soups, baked potatoes, bread sticks and more.  This location is still a favorite with the super high ceiling.  It's showing it's age (needs to be repainted) but I'm here for the food!

15 years we've been going to NW Clinic for Children.  Since the week our daughter was born.  We've been going to Dr. Kennedy since before she was a Kennedy and we prefer to see nobody else.  We've seen other doctor's in the office at times, but none are as fabulous and Dr. K.  Love her.  Trust her.  Highly recommend her.  Simply awesome!

Serrano's has my favorite salsa period. I love the chunkiness and the flavor. The salsa is the THE REASON I go to Serrano's. I used to work a mile down the street from the location at Rural and Guadalupe and I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch. I usually ordered something ala carte because the salsa was the reason I was there.   The rest of the menu is simply ordinary in my opinion. Ordinary food is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5. Still, I try and eat at Serrano's every time I'm on the east side of town since there are no locations west of Tempe.  I live 35 miles from the closest restaurant and still find a way to eat at one 5 or 6 times a year.  I'm amazed to see the same faces working there 10 years later too. They must be doing more than just salsa right!

Last night I took time out of my evening to drop in Fry's Electronics on Baseline to LOOK at some cameras. I've done a lot of research online but I can't get a couple questions answered without handling the merchandise.  I went here because they have an above average selection of cameras.  Unfortunately less than half of them had power to check and find out what I want to know.  Not one single Nikon camera in my price range had power.  What the heck!  The ONLY REASON I went here was to see, touch, experience the cameras.  It's the ONLY REASON I couldn't do everything online.  I was very disappointed with Fry's last night.  It had been a couple years since I was in that store.  It will probably be many more years before I visit them again.  PS. They now price match all online pricing.  That's cool, still it's less convenient than shopping at home in my jammies!

It's been awhile since I've eaten here.  I used to work just a mile down University and I'd eat the shrimp tacos at least once a week.  I loved this place because it was not standard mexican food.  They put some extra care into what they servce.  The tacos were like like little shrimp salads on a tortilla.  I usually dissected and them and savored every bite individually.    The chips and salsa are pretty good too.  Again, they don't taste like all the other places.  I think the atmosphere is pretty nice here, a little loud on the inside, but awesome on the patio when the weather's right.  Note that I've only been here for lunch, so I cannot comment on the nighttime atmosphere.  Love this place.  I miss being near it.

I love Honey Bear's!  I've been visiting their restaurants for years.  I've been to the one on Van Buran, the one on Central and this one in Tempe.  They have the runniest sauce on earth but dang it tastes great!  I love the pulled pork sandwiches but not the long lines at lunch.  When I went after 1pm in the afternoon I stood in a line of one - me.

These are great baseball/softball fields!  I'm not a City of Peoria resident and I don't visit this park for anything other than my son playing youth baseball  - both in club baseball and district little league tournaments.  The Rio Vista baseball/softball fields are some of the nicest, best maintained fields in the valley.  It's obvious the city cares about this park and their sports programs.  The grass is always green, cut and simply wonderful.  The infields are well maintained, well striped and watered, with one exception - the pitching mound on Field #7 has deteriorated to the point of being a pitching bump.  As of June 2011 It's far from the 12" height required for Little League play.  That being said, it's still a nice grass infield to play on.  I've had the opportunity to work with the staff at Rio Vista park too, just to communicate baseball scores during District 2 little league tournaments.  The staff is a joy to work with.  Thanks for a wonderful place for the kids to play baseball!

I waffled on my rating because I have some issues with some things here. Issues: Slow - it took over 10 minutes to make my sandwich. Soggy - the recommended bread was soggy.  I left a good portion of it behind because it was wet and blah.  I gave them 5 stars in the end because this was the best darn Chicken Parmesan sandwich I've ever had.  The guy taking my order recommended I get it on the Rosemary Sea Salt bread instead of the Cibata bread it comes with standard.  FABULOUS recommendation except the soggy issue noted above.  For flavor though... YUMMMM!  Next time I think I'll get the bread on the side or on top - an inverted open face sandwich, hmmm...  No matter, this sandwich was the bomb, even the shrooms and spinach was yummy (not so fond of shrooms).  I'll be ordering this again!

I'll eat chili anywhere!  This day I tried the Green Bay Chili.  I chose this over the Turkey Breast Chili as the waitress recommended it.  It was a little different than most.  I had good flavor with spicey peppers in it and good amount of meat.  I'll definitely order it again.

This is such an upgrade over fast food chains!    I always get the steak nachos.  I can't believe they're only $6 out the door.  There's more meat than I can eat, plus cheese & guacamole.   I did the drive thru and they gave me a few lil hot sauce/salsa's too.  I was still tasting this 10hrs later.  Gross to some, but a sign of good inexpensive mexican food.  :-)  Mmmmmm! Already looking forward to my next opportunity to eat here.

I'd give this place 3 stars but the drive through line was about 12 cars deep, so we went inside.  It took 10 minutes to get our food after ordering.  Coulda been a bad night or a bad time (9:30pm) but this isn't the first time the lines have been really long here.    Food is normal, wait is not.

My simple review of this branch: SUB PAR.  I don't usually bank here but the club I'm now a part of does.  I myself had to make several trips here trying to get put on the account.  Sometimes the wrong people are here and you can't get help beyond the basic teller.  I've tried calling to make an appointment and never can get someone on the phone.  So, I finally got put on the account and the guy in the little room FAILED to set me up with a bank card.  Standard procedure, right?  Apparently not the day I was there.  I went back in, spoke the manager (Kim), she said she'd get me setup.  Nope.  Two weeks later, no card.  I go back in.  Original guy says "I was waiting for you to come back in..."   Excuse me?  Don't you have my phone number?  Isn't this kinda like waiting in line for two weeks!!!   Aaargh!    Finally I get setup and I get a temporary bank card and would you believe he starts grilling me to bank there?  Uhm.... NO!  ya, CAPITAL NO.    I almost gave the branch one star.  To say they failed me isn't completely true.  They failed at first and then got it done.  So they really just wasted my time and pissed me off.  A lot of the people are friendly and Kim did work with me some over email.  I guess they try.  Still, I'd go somewhere else if given the option.  My account here belongs to the club and isn't mine, so...  hopefully I won't have to go in the branch ever again.

I had a breakfast sandwich - egg, bacon, pepper jack cheese on a jalopeno bagel! I loved mine, but my 15 yr old daughter was unimpressed with her roasted turkey on wheat. She just said it was boring. It needed some pizazz.   This probably doesn't need mentioning, because this was our first time at Heidi's, but the place wreaked of some sort varnish or something.  They said it was from the place next door that was under construction. I was simply disgusted with the smell. Almost had to leave.  The food was good though and I'll be back for more, and to see if it always stinks of something other than deli food.

This pizza and sandwich shop is uberdelicious!  I don't get in often as it's not in my neighborhood, but everything I've ever tried here is fantastic.  If they had one in my neighborhood I'd eat there multiple times a week.

I love Qdoba.  I don't eat here enough.  None close to my house.  I used to work next to this location and the staff is better than most restaurants like this.  My favorite thing at Qdoba?  Nachos.  Pork Nachos, Steak Nachos, any nachos as long as they're smothered in Queso sauce!  MMMMM!

I started watching ASU games at Sun Devil Stadium back in high school -  back in the early 80s.  I've seen some of the greatest games in this stadium during Rose Bowl runs in the 80s and 90s (nothing compares to the site of goal posts marching down 5th Ave after OT win over USC) and Arizona Cardinals games.  I've also been to the Coliseum in Los Angeles for USC vs UCLA football games and here's my thoughts on Sun Devil Stadium...  The stadium has evolved over the years but it's still the same classic venue it's always been, complete with bathtub urinals.  Everything's asphalt around the stadium and it's quite a hike to the upper deck seats or even the top of the lower deck seats, especially from 5th Ave., as the entire stadium is built on a pair of mountains.  C'mon, admit it!  It's one of the coolest placements of a stadium... ever!  Worst thing about the stadium in my opinion is simply that it's outdoors.  It's crazy hot in the "fall" when ASU starts playing and it's frigid (to us Phoenicians) in the winter, especially after dark with a breeze blowing in the upper deck.  Brrrr!  Spoiled are we with indoor Dbax and Cardinals stadiums.  This is certainly one of my favorite places to take my teen/preteen kids.  They find the stadium very interesting, though they always whine about the hike up to the stands.  College games are always a different experience than the pros. Very energetic crowds before during and after games.

Our network was down at work so I took a stroll over at Lowes, just checking out some things.  Planning...  I think Lowes is nicer-cleaner than Home Depot, and it's always less crowded.  Today everyone was very very friendly.  I was asked at least 5 times if I was doing OK or in need of some assistance.  That's how it's supposed to be at a Home Improvement store!

With regard to rice bowls, this place is better than average.  I had the Jamaican Jerk Cicken & Steak today.  Pretty good other than a piece of steak was unchewable.

I know IN-N-OUT is all the rage, but it's truly one of my least desirable destinations.  Why?  I'm not sure other than their food is uninspiring to me.  Is it fresh?  Yes.  Is that unusual for burger joints?  Yes.  Still... I'd just as soon get a burger anywhere than wait in line here for a generic burger.  Give me something smothered with BBQ sauce or bacon or pepper jack cheese.  Knowhatimean?

In the world of fast food (drive thrus) El Pollo Loco is one of the better choices in my opinion.  The food is less greasy and there's a salsa bar.  Need I say more?  I'll say it again: SALSA BAR.  I'm not big and I don't need all the food in most combo meals so I made up my own.  I got couple drumbsticks ($1 menu) and a coleslaw.  Washed it down with the Cola on tap. I through down some pico de gallo with most bites and called it lunch. Exactly what I expected.  Chicken and coleslaw via the drive thru.  I'll be driving thru again next time I need me some chicken.

This place just keeps getting better!  We've been visiting this park since the original WaterWorld days.  We had season passes when it reopened a couple years ago as Wet n Wild.  We didn't visit last year but did once this summer.  I was very pleased to see that they improved a few things since 2 seasons ago.  First improvement: a new ride - The Constrictor.  The kids (11 & 12yr old boys) thought it was the best ride in the park.  I can't comment as I did not try it.  Second improvement: Shade!  I was impressed with all the shade that was added over the faux grass / beach areas.  Third improvement: The entrance/exit to the wave pool.  I don't know how much of an improvement it was but the chaos seemed a little less.  Overall, this may be the best park in Phoenix.  I still prefer the "real" waves at Big Surf over the stupid swells of the the wave pool here, but the number of slides at Wet N Wild can't be beat in the Phx area.  My biggest complaint is the lines.  I hate waiting 20+ minutes for a 1 minute ride.    Again, I'm glad this park keeps improving.  Next year I see us getting season passes.  They more than pay for themselves on the 3rd visit.

Foothills Park in North Glendale, AZ is a more than just a dog park!!!  This park has a skate park, an aquatic center / fitness center, baseball/softball fields and a branch of the Glendale Public Library.  On the north side of the park is the Foothills branch of the Glendale Public Library. Here in 2011 this branch has started closing earlier a couple days a week and they are now closed on Thursdays and Sundays. You can still request books online to be transferred to this branch for your convenience.  The dog park was recently expanded with a new section of dog run that connects the front of the park on 57th Ave with the back of the park behind the library.  Parts of the dog park are closed a day a week for maintenance, but part of the park is open every day.  The baseball fields are the area of the park I use the most. Arrowhead Little League (www.ArrowheadLL.com) is based at this park and they play two seasons - Spring and Fall. The City of Glendale also runs baseball and softball programs at this park.    A playground sits on the South side of the baseball fields, just North of the wash.  The Aquatic Center (www.glendaleaz.com/foothillscenter/) has an outdoor pool with slides and lap pools.  There's a fitness center indoors with all the equipment of a normal gym plus a rock climbing wall and full indoor basketball court.  The kids love to hang out at the rec center.  The skate park on the west side of 57th is an area I've avoided thus far. It's usually packed with kids riding skateboards.

I really like the Chicken and the Waffles here.  Both are tasty  Good stuff.    I'm not big on the big glass of colored super-sugar water they call Koolaid.  Yikes that's a lot of sugar!  These guys would get 5 stars from me except the wait on the weekend afternoons is stupid!  We tried on Saturday but didn't want to wait 1/2hr, came back Sunday with a couple more people and were told 45 minutes.  Over an hour later we harassed them into putting together some patio tables so we could EAT.  It was cold and windy and kinda sucked, but the food is yummy so we were mostly pacified.  I recommend going here, just pick a quiet time if there is one.

Big League Dreams is one of a number of baseball parks we frequent with the kids playing travel baseball.  It is one of the nicest facilities with paved sidewalks, individual ballpark seating with some shade cover, and indoor clubhouses (free to enter) with A/C, snack bar, bar & televisions.  From a viewing perspective, the nicest facility we've been at to date.  The fields are fairly well kept, though they have some drainage issues with it rains (we've had games canceled after rain).  The area behind the plate is far to large for younger players and the net over the backstop area intrudes on playable pop ups, but it I'm sure it helps keep the facility in better shape.  The biggest issue I have is one they BLD cannot control... it's an hour from my house, so I dread driving out and back a couple times in a weekend.    Overall, one of the best facilities in town, but I'm always hoping for better.

Dick's is not my favorite sporting goods store. I hate to pay full retail for this stuff. Luckily (I guess) I'm in the store frequently and I often find things I want on clearance. I'm a sucker for a nice dri-fit T or polo under $15.  Dick's has a standard selection comparable to most sporting goods chains. They have above average camping and golf departments at this location at Arrowhead Mall.  The thing I most appreciate Dick's for is their support of youth sports. Every season they donate new equipment to our Little League and they provide us with a great location for registration. They have been awesome to work with!

Standard Denny's food, which is fine, but the waiter intentionally kept our orders on one ticket.  STUPID!   We told him which people were together.  He kept them together claiming that people forget to pay their bills when they are broken up.  What?  STUPID!  We had to spend a few extra minutes at the counter breaking them up again, and since we didn't arrive together (a half hour apart) we weren't ready to leave together.  It was the end of a long day and I didn't need this one last irritation.  I'm surprised I tipped him.  :-|    Would be 3 stars cuz its what I expect from Denny's food.  Two stars cuz of the STUPID ticket thing.

I've eaten at a lot of small cafe/mexican food places like this including Chipotle, Qdoba, Baja Fresh and other small hole-in-the-wall places.  This is one of my favorites because they have some of the most tender meats that they pull/shred there in front of you.  I love the location there on corner of 59th & Union Hills.  Very convenient!

We stop in this QT every time we pass by, which varies from a few times a month to months in between.  It's on our way to play baseball some 60 miles from home.  The people here are friendlier than average, even moreso than most QTs.

This is an outlet JC Penny!  The selection is limited.  However, everything is marked down.  I've purchased some things here, returned some things here, and they are easy to work with.

CHILI DOGS!!!  I get a chili dog every time I'm near this place!  I love 'em.  I'm not a hot dog connoisseur (and I probably wouldn't admit it if I was) but this place has good dogs.  Good Chili Dogs too!  Every eat a chili dog at Sonic?  THIS IS NOT A SONIC DOG!  THANK G!!!  This is good stuff!  My wife usually gets the Chicago dog and loves it.  My son loves the Italian Sausage here.  I'm just stuck on the chili d's.  :-)

This was A TASTY BURGER!  I like this much better than In N Out.  I got a little cheese & bacon and added lettuce tomato and BBQ sauce, green peppers too.  I shoulda added some onion.  Pretty good!  The fries did not impress.  They aren't steak fries and they aren't skinny lil McD's fries.  They're right in the middle with skins still on them.  They were OK, but nothing exciting.  I'm not sure where the Five Guys name comes from.  I saw 8 people behind the counter.  :-)

We rolled in tonight at 9pm and everyone in this place greeted me!  They asked if I'd ever been to a Firehouse Subs - I replied NO - and they told me about how they do things differently.  I wasn't in the mood for a sub (I came with friends) so I got a bowl of CHILI.  It was fairly standard but good.  They added some cheese and chopped up some onions and put that in too.  I was very pleased.  And once again let me say - the people were very friendly and welcoming.  I'll be coming back soon.

This sport center is probably the nicest facility in Phoenix for indoor soccer/football and basketball/volleyball.  I attended a girls youth basketball tournament here this past weekend and four courts were in use the entire weekend.    This reminds me of the Premier facility in Gilbert except that it was designed for this use and not built within an existing industrial building.  There is little room for spectators (small bleachers between courts) but it's still better laid out than competing facilities and high school gyms when their seats are withdrawn for more court use. Unfortunately there are no stands to extend for championship games here.  Also, I did not like the way the players benches are on Court #1 - the players' backs are exposed to a lot of foot traffic right next to the snack bar.    I shoot a lot of basketball photos and the facility is well lit on the basketball side. This is compared to high school gyms.  Arena's like Wells Fargo Arena are far superior with regard to lighting.   There is snack bar that was grilling up some stuff.  I smelled french fries all weekend long but resisted the urge to spend my money here. Many choices of restaurants were just a couple miles away.  Note that the address for this facility does not show up correctly on Google, MapQuest, etc at this time (May 2011).  New roads were created for this facility and they have not been picked up yet.  The facility is located 1/2 mile South of 1-10 off Avondale Blvd.  Overall this is nice facility, one of the nicest in Phoenix.  It's just not the most comfortable place to spend two full days.

WOW! this was delicious!    The salsas are pretty tasty. Mild, green, fire roasted (which I found myself eating continuously), hot and of course pico de gallo. As we were walking to the car my son said "I'm glad we went here.  It was good.  You know what I liked best?  The salsa!"  My kid loved his cheese quesadilla.  It was LARGE. I had a bite and I'm thinking they butter the cooking surface as it reminded me of a grilled cheese sandwich.  He got some beef on the side but hardly put a dent in it.  I had a beef taco and chili relleno combo and they were both great!  The taco had one of the tastiest shells I've ever had, but the relleno was the highlight of the night for me.  Appearance and texture were not impressive, but the sauce they put over it... WOW!  Saute'd peppers and tomatoes - not the usual red sauce for sure.  Other things to note - They guys working were exceptional.  They came out and checked on us a couple times.  You could tell it was important to them that we loved the food.   I was initially disappointed with the $19 I spent on a meal and a quesadilla, but we added meat to the quesadilla and got two drinks - and the food was tasty enough to make the price appropriate.    We will be back soon!

This place is pretty tasty!  The burger was good.  Well above average, but it better be when it's $5 or more.   My kid and I got a burger each, a soda, a shake and a mixer thing (like a Blizzard) and I dropped $20.  That's a bit over my budget for two.  We try and stay under $12 which is doable if we skip the ice cream/custard.  I don't know that we'd skip that if we're going to Culver's though.  The custard is pretty good.  Understand that I'm not a connoisseur of ice creams and related deserts.  They pretty much fall into two categories for me.  Good and not so good.  This is on the good side.  I prefer Fudruckers and Five Guys over these burgers.  I also prefer Cold Stone for ice cream.

I've been eating at Shangri-La since I was a kid - so what, almost 30 years!  I can't believe it took me this long to notice their new location at 59th & Bell.  I got the Garlic Shrimp and boy did i miss this dish!  It hasn't changed in years.  Big 'ol shrimp in garlic sauce over rice.  I wish it came with some vegetables on the side or something like that, but this is all its ever been, so I knew what to expect.  DELICIOUS!  Wife got Mongolian Beef.  The meat was good quality an once again, DELICIOUS (yes I tried some).  The rookie, the 12 year old son says "is it like Panda Express?".  BLAH!  So we asked what closely resembles teriaki chicken and they whipped some up though its not on the menu.  I thought it was bland, but it was full of carrots and green beans and was exactly what the kid hoped.  PERFECT!  The staff is very friendly and knows the regulars.  Hopefully we'll gain that status soon.  We'll be going back every time we want to sit and spend a little more than fast food chinese.    We're very glad to discover this is now in our hood!

GOOD BURGER!  First thing i noticed when i walked in the door was all the help in their extremely bright green shirts.  YIKES!    I got the bacon cheeseburger with cheddar.  It was pretty tasty.  I bit heavy on the shredded lettuce, placed under the burger (weird! made the bottom bun soggy quickly too) but the cheese, CB sauce & bacon were good.  The beef was pretty tasty too. The pickles were really good.  What I didn't like was the price.  $9.25 for a burger and a drink.  That's a bit much by my standards.  I mean you could serve me 80 proof beef from cows that were raised on pure Jack Daniels and I'd think this a bit expensive.  Note that the burger was $6 and the soda and tax were the remainder.    Either way, it was good, just pricey.  I went with a coworker and she had a ground chicken burger that should woulda given 6 stars, but I disqualified her from rating since she hadn't eaten in 2 days and I think she would have given my shoe 5 stars.  She said it was really friggin good though.

This new pet store at 67th Ave & Bell Rd has a good selection of dog food and dog supplies.  They carry the full line of Canidae dog food that we have been buying for years, and for a couple dollars less than The Stock Shop down the street.  We went here because we had a $10 off coupon when we spent $40 or more.  We'll probably be back because it's closer to home and a few dollars less.

Yuuuummmmmm!   I love Honeybaked Ham.  I love it on sandwiches too.  This "cafe" is a Honeybacked Ham store where you can walk up and order a sandwich.  They have a small menu with only a couple types of bread, but it's delicious!  I've never seen more than a couple people here at a time as long as I'm not visiting around the holidays.

I love the bagels here, especially when they're hot and fresh, which they were last week when I busted the door down at 5:30am.  I have to give these guys big props because I was in a rush that morning.  I called the store 10 minutes before they opened just to see if they had the bagels I wanted ready to go.  They did and the guy on the phone (sorry, forgot his name) took my order for a dozen bagels and an iced mocha on the phone BEFORE THE WERE OPEN FOR BUSINESS!  TWO THUMBS WAY UP FOR THAT!!!  I got to the store a few minutes before 5:30. The doors were still locked.  I saw a couple people inside, but I just kicked it in the car for a minute because I can tell time (I was early).  When the guy unlocked the door, he held it open for me, asked if I was Mike, and said my order was ready.  AWESOME!!!  Super happy!   Made my (early) morning.  Thanks guys!!!

Love the pizza!  Made with fresh dough and fresh ingredients the way all pizza should be made.  My son (14) asks if we can go here anytime we're outside the west valley. Outside the west valley must mean we're close, right?  Why?  Because he and his buddies think the Zzepoles are the greatest food EVER!!!

This is my second time here since the reopening under new ownership & new name. Both times I've eaten out in the Taqueria (take out shack by the street). Today I got a Grande Shrimp Taco and a side of rice. I'm glad I got the large (4oz of shrimp) taco, its close to the size the old owner served. At $5.49 its priced about the same as before.  The young man behind the counter brought me chips N salsa before my taco came up, which was a pleasant surprise both because I got two sides, not a meal, and because I expected them to call #12 back to the counter since it so large on my receipt. Maybe they do that when its busier. I thought the green salsa vwrde was delicious and the chips were very thin like I like them.  The shrimp taco looked just like before, with big ol shrimp N pineapple on a double corn tortilla. Unfortunately this isn't quite the old owners taco. It was cooked properly and the quality was g9d (tender & juicy) but the flavor was pretty bland. Not at all bad, but not where the bar was set. The rice was very ordinary too.  All in all, this was a 4 star meal to me, as long as u don't keep measuring them to the old place.
