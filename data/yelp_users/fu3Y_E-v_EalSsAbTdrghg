I went here last night with my boyfriend and a good friend of ours. We came around 7PM and were sat immediately. We were quickly a bread basket and a crudites platter. The crudites were yummy, however I found the biscuits a bit floury and the jalapeno cornbread nothing too special.   Our waitress was very attentive and gave all kinds of recommendations. I ordered the filet oscar plate, my boyfriend ordered the new york strip and our friend ordered the prime rib. Our food arrived not too long after we ordered and it looked GREAT! The filet oscar was fantastic, however there was no bacon wrapped around it.. but I may be ignorant to what filet oscars are supposed to look like since my only experience is at the Keg. My meal was served with asparagus spears and shredded carrots and french green beans which were room temperature.. still tasty.  The new york strip was excellent and the prime rib looked pretty good.. It was very rare to my friends liking, I didn't care for the texture but apparently he liked it since he pretty much scraped his plate clean.  We had the chocolate mousse for dessert which was ok.. nothing too special.  My only gripe is that it did take a bit for our check to arrive and for our waitress to cash it out. Other then that, no complaints.

Hollywood Alley RIP!  In my wildest dreams, Hollywood Alley would still be open. I would be at the bar watching the Goonies, eating way too many hot wings, drinking too many vodka crans... Talking shit with the bartenders and other patrons. Ahh, sweet memories.   I loved Hollywood Alley. We would come here early and watch creepy documentaries with the bartender Eric. Crappy bar food, cheap beer, strong drinks.. What's not to love? Never use the bathroom and try to never imagine what it looked like with all the lights on :) I hope Ross is doing well, such a shame to see this place closed.

It looks like a dump, but it really isn't.  Tons of way cool herps here! There is a snake in this store that's bigger than a grown man. All the herps looks healthy and well taken care of. Even the damn hissing cockroaches look cheerful. They sell lighting, decorations, aquariums, starter kits, bowls, supplements and feeders (mice, worms and crickets.)   Average customer service, but the guys here really know their stuff. The stores downfall = a bit more expensive than other places..... but you get what you pay for.

I remember when this place was nothing more than a hole in the wall :) I went here a couple of months ago and WOW! What a change! The food is still delicious as ever, but they have really upgraded the place and it is a really nice restaraunt now. A great place to go for a first date.

This restaraunt is convienently located right next door to Planned Parenthood. Not that it means anything, but it's a really good place to stuff your fat face with chile rellanos and margaritas when your tests didn't come back the way you wanted.   Other than that it's pretty delicious.

I've only been here once and it was for my friend's birthday party on the weekend. LOTS of people were here. The waitresses were so very nice! It did take awhile for our food to come out, but I'm assuming thats because we ordered 45405348347598454 rolls... Between the sake bombers and overdosing on eel rolls, I can't really remember if the service was exceptional.. all I can say is that I didn't get sick so that has to say a lot :D

I love Sallys. It's not like a need more shit in my bathroom that I will never use, but I buy to boost my self esteem, it's that its all decently priced! All the girls are very helpful, and they don't mind when I spend a half hour deciding between 2 slightly different shades of lipstick. Aww yeah.

I've been to BWW on two occasions and they both earned one star. First occassion I went with  my boyfriend and we were meeting up with a couple of friends. My boyfriend orders a beer and hands our waitress his I.D. She then proceeds to tell him that she needs TWO FORMS OF I.D. "My drivers license isn't good enough?", he says. "No." responds the waitress. Uhhh, ok.   Second occasion was tonight 1/5/2010. A fundraiser for the Gilbert police officer that was killed in duty. Good cause, right? I figured I'd go with one of my good friends. Man we got the shittiest waitress ever. She has a snotty attitude the entire time and keeps talking to all her dumb  coworkers. Every time she screwed up it was "Oh, I'm sorry I'm busy." Are you freaking joking me? We order our food and some of our friends join us. It takes her almost 30 minutes to bring us dessert which is fried churros and ice cream. I KNOW it doesn't take that long to bring my cold ass churros and melted ice cream to my fucking table. Don't worry.  I didn't tip.  I don't understand people who say ZOMG THESE FUCKIN WINGS ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!!)$i(!! Because they aren't. They are mediocre at best. NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN.

Sephora is like crack for me. I went in here last weekend for the first time, and I came out thinking how the hell did I survive without this glorious land of sparkly makeup and excessive purfume? Screw you Ulta and Target, Sephora stole my little vain heart.   I came out of here with several wild shades of eyeshadow including purple and lime green, which I am sure I will never wear since I usually wear neutral or coal colors. But whatever. I am an eyeshadow fiend.

How the hell have I survived this long without knowing the god-like sandwiches that are made here?  I don't like "sub sandwiches". I hardly like regular sandwiches. When my boyfriend says "Hey, you want to get a sub?", I'm like "FUCK NO, don't you know that I hate them?!" But then one day he took me here and OMG.. my life has been forever changed.  I ordered the "white widow" which was a delicious combination of chicken, cheese and I think ranch dressing. OMG. It was like an orgasm in my mouth.  I happily ate my awesome sandwich and giggled when I looked over on the wall painting and there was a little stoned crab smiling up at me. He totally knew how GLORIOUS this sandwich was.   The staff is very nice, the food was delicious, and it was quite possible that at least half of the customers were stoned. But that's ok. Stoner food is mouth watering. I'm longing for my next toasted sub adventure. Mmmmm.

I really like this place. I found it while bored one Sunday with my Mom. We never knew this place existed before!   It isn't the most striking place I've ever been to, but they do have some unsual critters there. Tons of tanks and a lot of custom-made options, huge freezer food selection and there is a whole room dedicated just to live rock. They even have a baby shark there!  If it was my store, the place could use a lot of work appearance wise, but the great customer service makes up where they are lacking.

Do you like coffee?  Do you like actually staying alert for those extra needed hours of a cram sesh before a test or a god awful double shift in retail?  Go to Lees and order the Vietnamese iced coffee. Lawd have mercy it is like the holy grail of legal stimulants.   For my health conscious friends, forewarning that this bad boy has probably a half of cup of sweetened condensed milk in it but it's totally worth it! It's soo delicious and yes you will stay up allll night. If you work at a normal time in the am do not drink one of these after three because you will not be sleeping until 130am - true story... Oh and the sandwiches are really good too!

I love this place! The best dim sum in Chandler. My service was exceptional, I even went on lunchtime on a Friday with my boyfriend. It was priced fairly good, we both gorged ourselves on less than $30.00. Not too sure about the pink tablecloths or the giant lobster tank, but overall it was delicious :)

During the summertime I live on bingsoo. In fact, during the wintertime I live on bingsoo as well. Because it's that damn good. Everyone here is super friendly too. That may be because I come in 3 times a week though. You can even get a little frequent buyers punch card and after your 10th bingsoo or whatever you get you get a free one. Awwwee yeeahh. I've heard that the bingsoo they serve here isn't "authentic", but who cares - it's to die for.

This is Arizona's Disneyland. For real.  I absolutely LOVEEEE this place! And the bison burgers here are to DIE FOR. Mmm, bison. I'm not all that into hunting and guns and boats and what not, but my boyfriend is and he loves to come here. I mostly just look at the dead animals and look cute while he foams at the mouth. As long as he buys me a bison burger, I'm stay here as long as he wants.

I really like this dog park because it is much bigger than other parks here in Chandler. Bigger space = less dog fights.   I love the hills and the fenced in area for smaller or timid dogs. Dogs are generally well behaved and the people are friendly. I've seen people bring guitars and strum quietly on benches while the dogs run around and play. It's a great park.   Leave the younger kids at home, a child running and screaming through the park is a perfect target for an over reactive dog. Bring poop bags and water for yourself and your dog. Leave the treats and toys at home, they can cause a fight between dogs.

Owning pets is a responsibility, not a right. If your pet has a condition where it needs to see a specialist, it is obviously going to be more expensive. With that said, YES this place can be a bit pricey but the outcome is 100% worth it.  I have a 9 year old Miniature Pinscher named Gunner. Two years ago, after an incompetent vet diagnosed his eye ulcer as an eye infection, he had to have his eye removed. He's always had sensitive eyes, so we took extra precautions with his remaining eye. Earlier this year he was scratching and tearing at his eye, so I suspected another ulcer. My vet referred me to Eye Care for Animals. I saw Dr. Felchle and she was professional, positive and answered all my questions. The tech was fantastic as well. Turns out Gunner didn't have an ulcer, but lipid deposits allergies. Dr.Felchle recommended he go on a dose of Zyrtec for the remainder of his life and lubricating eye-drops twice a day. He had a recheck a few months later with a different vet here and she was amazed at how fantastic his eye looked.   Last week I noticed the same thing again, except he was violently pawing at his eye. Scheduled a visit here and it looked like he did have an ulcer. Dr.Felchle did a corneal debridement procedure on his eye, which was the least invasive course of action. A week later at the recheck, it was sad news that his ulcer wasn't healing correctly and he'd have to have a grid keratotomy surgery. YES the surgery was very expensive, but I was confident in my decision based on the fact of how patient and understanding my tech was (Elizabeth) and how knowledgeable and confident Dr.Felchle was.   Gunner goes back for a recheck in two weeks and I will update my review with his (fingers crossed) positive results from surgery.

UPDATE:  Gunner went back for his stitch removal with Dr.Felchle. His eye is back to normal and looks GREAT! Gunner has had watery eyes for years and several weeks post surgery his eye hardly ever waters. It is a miracle what people can do with medicine. Thank you so much Dr.Felchle and her team! Gunner and I are forever thankful for your wealth of knowledge and for helping Gunner and his eye problems.

O Target, how I love thee. It's just bad news for me if I go into target, alone, with my credit cards after I've paid them off. I honestly do not need summer colored matching towels/toilet seat cover/floor mat/shower curtain for my bathroom, nor do I need pink kitchen gadgets or an assortment of potted plants that will surely die in a few weeks. But somehow they end up in my cart full of crap at the end of my shopping excursion. I love Target.

I love Joes Farm Grill. It's definately worth the drive! I have never had anything from here that wasn't absolutely delicious! They have great pumpkin milkshakes too :D It's very cute and great for families or even a cute place to go for a date. Except if you hate kids (like me). These little shits are everywhere, running around screaming and being gross with food all over their faces. Wtf, for real. But the plus is that it's right next door to Cosmo Dog Park, so there are always a few cute dogs hanging out with their owners. Oh, and the food is kickass.

Went here with a girlfriend of mine and it was great! Compared to other sushi place I go to often this place was kind of expensive. Apparently there is happy hour ALL DAY which is SCHWEET!   I ordered the calamari and it was 'ok'. I'm a huge fan of squid and I was dissapointed that this calamari was cooked a little too long which made it kind of chewy. Edamame is delicious!  I had my first sashimi here (tuna) and it was like an ORGASM in my mouth. It was absolutely delicious and totally worth the outrageous price. We also split a couple of different rolls that were HUGE, each one of them were delicious although a little too 'American"-ized for my tastes :)   I would definatley come back here for drinks or as a date night if you go early. It's a very good place, I only give it 4 stars because it's in DouchebagLand aka Scottsdale.

Ah yes, the pound. This is the place where you assholes bring your dog that you don't want anymore... some people even get creative and say "Oh, I found him running along the street.." and then they burst out in trears when they get into their car..... Or you dumbasses who say "Oh, I just wanted her to have ONE litter.....but I can't find homes for all the puppies" D'oh! You shouldn't be breeding unless you have a SHOW QUALITY dog and are a reputable breeder..........I could go on and on with this.....  Other than that, MCACC does vaccinations, spay & neuter and dog liscensing.   If you do not plan on getting a dog from a show breeder, then you should definately check out the pound! This is where I got my 9lb Miniature Pinscher last year. He is the BEST dog I have ever owned! He's so smart, funny and cute and is overall a great dog..... (too bad he's not a guy! damn!). I got him for 60 bucks and that included all his shots and his neuter surgery.  Almost all the smaller dogs (chihuahuas and the like) are going to be more expensive, but you can get a big lovey pit bull/mix for less than $50.00! Soooo many cute doggies at the pound too! Oh, and I believe the kitties run at about $25.00.  Don't shop, adopt!

I've been wishing there was a good pho place close to my house and BAM this baby opens up.   The restraunt itself is small and pretty much avoid this place during lunch time or the weekends because it will be packed. I went here as soon as they opened on a Saturday and probably 20 minutes after sitting down it was steadily getting packed.  We had the papaya salad and pork dumplings to water. They were perfect! I had a bowl of pho and good grief it was everything I imagined on a cool winters day. The broth was so flavorful, the steak was like happiness in my mouth and the noodles were the added bonus at the end.  This place is amazing! They also serve my guilty pleasure Vietnamese iced coffee. Yum.   If you want good pho for a very decent price, come here! Come early and leave fat and happy. Woo!

UGH I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH :( Like too much.. srsly..  Yummy selection of flavors that they are always changing up. Tart and pomegranate raspberry are delish as well as pistachio. Last time I went they had coffee and peanut butter flavors YUM!!!!  The fruit toppers are the BEST! Always fresh and sweet. I like that they have different toppers from time to time.. today I went and they had CHOCOLATE. COVERED. STRAWBERRIES. Yes, I know.  It's always clean in here and the staff is always super friendly. Don't go in the bathroom though, kind of smelly :(

If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  My boyfriend is currently living in Texas for work and wanted to surprise me with an edible arrangement for our 8 year anniversary. He ordered it ONE WEEK in advance to be delivered to my work. The woman he spoke on the phone with guaranteed delivery before 3PM.  Delivery day rolls around and there was no edible arrangement in sight. He called and spoke with a different gal who told him that she didn't know why he was guaranteed delivery before 3PM because they only guarantee delivery til 5PM. I waited until 5:10PM at my work and there still was no edible arrangement. He called and had them deliver it to his house. I got home at 6:30PM and left at 9PM - still no delivery. No call, no email, nothing.  I call the next day and spoke with Jen who was at first pretty courteous on the phone, but after I started voicing my displeasure I could tell she was getting agitated with me. She blamed the missed delivery on the fact that we had a dust storm. If you live in Arizona you should know that we get dust storms in the summertime. This place is right down the road from my work and there was NO DUST STORM between 3PM-5PM, just wind. This doesn't answer my question: if delivery is guaranteed before 5PM, why didn't I receive my edible arrangement? She then told me that her manager delivered the arrangement at 7:30PM to his house. I left at 9PM because there was no delivery. You want to know how long it is to drive from this location to my boyfriends house? 15-20 minutes tops. How long is it to drive from this location to my work? Less than 10 minutes. You had ALL DAY to deliver this. The windy weather didn't start til about 4PM. Why wasn't the arrangement delivered earlier if you knew there would be inclement weather?  I asked to have his money refunded on his card, because honestly we are so upset that they ruined something special that my boyfriend was trying to do for me on our anniversary. Jen said that she was not authorized to do a a refund. I let her know that my boyfriend lives in Texas, where there is a two hour time difference, and works 12-16 hour days where there is little to no cell service. It would be highly unlikely that he would be able to call during their business hours. She then asked me if he had no cell service, how was he able to speak with her manager the previous day? i don't know, why wasn't my arrangement delivered before 5? Questions that apparently have no answer.  Not only am I appalled at how rude Jen was, but I am just in disbelief at this company's overall lack of care to their customers on their special day. NOBODY has even apologized for ruining our anniversary. My boyfriend did get a call through and got his card refunded, however it will take 9-12 BUSINESS DAYS for the refund to show up. What?! He also said that there was no apologies and general lack of concern for our displeasure.  This place is horrid and I can't believe that they are willing to treat their customers like this. Annie the manager needs to work on her customer service training for her employees. Or at least tell them to say "I'm so sorry". I am letting everyone know to not use this place.

Update: I never received a phone call from "Annie" or anyone from Edible Arrangements about my refund. I called and spoke with the manager (forget her name but it wasn't Annie) and she said that the refund had to be completed through the original store the arrangement was purchased through, and that she would call them and let them know. A week passes and we still have no refund. I called and speak with the same manager and she did promptly take care of us and refund the money onto my boyfriends card, which I gave the card info over the phone. She then informed me that Jen was not authorized to do any refunds of any kind over the phone, so basically my boyfriend gave his card information to a stranger.   We've taken care of our accounts, however BEWARE of this place. We NEVER recevied an apology for ruining our 8 year anniversary. HORRIBLE customer service and I will never recommend any Edible Arrangements locations to anyone ever again.

How to have a good time:  1. Put your cowboy boots on 2. Have $3 dollars worth of $0.50 well drinks 3. Request Alan Jackson's "Good Time" 4. Ask one of the old cowboys to swing you around on the dance floor 5. Repeat  :)

Um how did I drive past this place forever and never go in?  Pretty much the best wings I've ever had. I'm picky when it comes to food, especially when I know how easy it is to prepare it correctly with real ingredients. ATL Wings did not disappoint! We tried the Parmesan garlic, mild and ATL style wings. Do yourself a favor and take the cashiers recommendation - get all your wings ATL style! The flavor is amazing, perfect balance between herbs, spices and a tiny bit hot. The mild flavor is vinegary, just like how homemade sauce should be and Parmesan garlic is very good as well!  We came early Friday afternoon, place was clean and got our food in about ten minutes. Everyone was very friendly. Soda, tea and kool aid are your choice of drink.   This place is awesome and on my list now!

I have been to the Pearl in Scottsdale and it is worlds better than this one.   I have been to this location several times since it is nearby my house. I have been sat at a booth near a window and watched ants and other small bugs crawling on the inside of the window, right next to me. I've been sat at dirty tables. The service is hit or miss.. sometimes you get an attentive server and sometimes you get a server who takes forever to refill your sake or bring you your check.. which is odd because the place is stupidly small.  My boyfriend took me here in April for my birthday. Again, the service was meh.. took awhile to get our check and our beers. The sushi was very good, however a few hours later it didn't seem to agree with me. I have NEVER been sick off of sushi and I have eaten it for years from all different places. Raw tuna is one of my favorite things in the world.   I had the worst vomity, poopy experience ever after eating that.. thinking maybe it was something else I ate, it couldn't have been the sushi, the next day my boyfriend informed me of his gastric discomforts too. We were both sick for a full two days.   Save your gas money and drive to the Pearl in Scottsdale. Avoid this place unless you enjoy curling around your toilet :)

They've remodeled the park! There are a lot more benches to sit at, including around the corner in the long run. Still best times to go are early morning til early afternoon (before the 5pm rush hits). Still closed on Weds for maintenance. Only downside is that they put down this red sand that will stain your interior, especially if your pup gets muddy paws.

This is literally the best veterinarian practice I have ever been to.  I have a 10 year old Miniature Pinscher who has had problems his entire life. Thus, veterinarians have been a unfortunate constant in our lives. I've popped from vet to vet and it just didn't seem like we clicked. Dr. Stickland changed that! You can tell that she truly loves her job and her clients. She remembers our last visits and funny things that happen in the room - now she may just be an exceptional note taker or maybe she has a photogenic memory, but it is a wonderful touch that your veterinarian that you see every few months remembers something that you talked about during your last visit. What's even better is that my favorite vet tech Sheryl now works here! Ask for her, she's the best :)  Gunner LOVES the vet and is so excited to go into the backroom with all the girls. They all fawn over him and take such great care of him. Dr. Stickland is very knowledgeable and explains everything in plain English. I have never second guessed any of her suggestions and everything has always turned out perfect with Gunner.   We had to put down our elderly Italian Greyhound last September. Dr. Stickland was not there but Dr. Duregger helped us through the process. They were so personal, kind and understanding of what we were going through. They sent us a beautiful paw print, his ashes in a pretty wooden box and made a donation in his name to the Arbor Society.   I would recommend this vet to anyone!

Apparently I've driven past this place for quite awhile and never noticed it was an amazing coffee shop until a few weeks ago. I had been complaining that Chandler had no good coffee shops within a mile radius of my house and then our Coffee Gods shined down upon this place.   This is a classic coffee shop - there aren't any ice cream drinks on the menu (sorry high school freshmen) but there are all kinds of espresso drinks that will jack you right up so you can make it through any god awful Sunday brunches with your less than desirable family members.

This place is pretty cool! It's right inside a salon. I know that sounds weird but the concept of it all is really interesting once you get inside. This is a traditional coffee shop, no frilly drinks here. Nitro coffee is... Interesting and makes me feel like I'm drinking beer on my lunch break. They make a great cappuccino and almond milk latte. My only wish is that it was bigger!
