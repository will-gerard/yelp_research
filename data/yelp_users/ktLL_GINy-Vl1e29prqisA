I certainly enjoyed having lunch here,  the burger was phenomenal.  I had the pastrami burger with fries, and chilli.  The burger was a top contender for the best in the area.  I certainly would eat here again when in the neighborhood.

Went here today for Christmas dinner and I am glad I did.  I didn't have high expectations, however the food exceeded them and was very fresh and tasted quite well.  The friendly environment made it all the better.

I wasn't impressed not even the slightest, I am from Boston so I am spoiled when it comes to fresh amazing seafood spots. The clams where the size of peas which is what ruined it for me the most. The clam strips where nothing more that a batch of fried batter. I know moving out to the desert I would be giving up my love for seafood on a regular basis, and only being able to indulge when I visit home. I figured i would at least give it a try,but It will probably be the one an only time I ever disappoint myself like this again.  P.S stop adding New England names to to your menu items because its not even comparable to the greatness of back home recipes.

I am a big fan of this pizza place, great food great prices, friendly service.  I enjoy coming here for lunch to get the slices.  Being from the east coast I find it hard to get good pizza out this way, and this spot definitely has that back home vibe and taste.

I have a great deal of respect for a buisness that values the customers.  After having an unpleasant experience I was gifted a gift card at an attempt to better my experience.  This experience was much better.  The service was great, the food was awesome.  I certainly will continue to be a customer thanks again.

Chicken pita is really good with the honey mustard,  I have been here a couple of times.  If I'm ever in the area I certainly stop in for very well priced delicious lunch.  If I could offer any suggestions it would be the decor of the place could use some renovating, however doesn't take away from the may point of being there EATING

Being an Italian from the East Coast I am disappointed on a regular basis when it comes to the pizza choices here.  I have found a few acceptable places with some decent pizza, however this is definitely not one of them.  I've had frozen pizza better than this.  took well over an hour for delivery, showed up barely warm, undercooked, and should have came with a missing toppings sign because they were no where to be found.

I've been to a number of these stores, and for decorations or womans clothing it may be a hit, but for mens clothing I just get disappointed Everytime I attempt to shop there.

I love this place, I come here quite often for lunch or dinner.  Only dislike is having to pay. 50 cents for a Togo box...? I mean it's only. 50 cents but still just include it in your pricing don't make me have to dish out some coins which I never carry.

Today was my first experience dining here.  The family and I met to celebrate two birthdays together while enjoying a family dinner.  I can't think of one negative thing about our complete dining experience from the Food to the service.  Our server Mark was hands down one of the best servers I have ever had wait my table.  He was very outgoing and knowledgeable, and just took care of our table from start to finish.  The food was excellent and cooked perfectly!  This will be my go to barbecue joint from this point on in the east valley area!!

I enjoy coming here to browse around and walk around outside.  Good place to get out of the house and bring the kids If you have any.  I love going to Grimaldis, and the Gelato place is amazing!

Being from the east coast we don't have any in an out burger joints.  I am definitely a fan of this place the burgers are great only downfall is the lack of menu options and the lack of meat....  Fatten those patties up?

Great place to watch sports, cover charges on boxing matches are to high especially with never any drink specials.  Food is mediocre.  Service is decent overall not a bad spot, but there are better options close by.

I am personally a pretty big fan of Rubios.  I get the same two items every time I go.  California bowl with chicken and Verde sauce, with a chicken gourmet taco.  Mmmmm deliciousness.  I am a frequent visitor to this location as I live nearby.

I hate to give bad reviews, but I just can't seem to have an enjoyable experience at this place.  Great spot to stop for a quick beer, but other than that the food isn't good, the service is very sub par, and the bar area is to small and crowded. Some renovations might do this place some justice.

If you've been to one festival you been to them all...  Overpriced admissions, shady games with shady people running them, and Overpriced subpar food.  I attended this festival today just for the sake of having something to do, and I left saying the same exact thing I always do, why the hell do I keep coming to these things.

First and foremost I will start by saying my favorite food in the world is BBQ ribs!  I went here yesterday for my birthday lunch to have just that,  I ordered tge chilli for starters which was pretty decent,  but a little heavy on the sour cream and lacking in the meat department. I ordered the baby back ribs of course for my entree with the mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  I am a fan of all style of ribs,  however these ribs where not the best and not the worst, but could certainly be better.  I understand there not "fall off the bone ribs"  but they were tougher than most steaks I've had.  I am a fan of this place and will return for other menu items, but the ribs need some extra love for sure.

Overall a good place with a friendly staff, good prices, and good sandwiches.  The meat to bread ratio needs some improvements for sure.  I ordered a steak and cheese sub and it was pretty laughable the amount of steak that thinly layered my sub.

I can't say enough great things about this place.  One of the best experiences I've ever had in any coffee shop across America.  The shop is very nicely decorated, and honestly the best cup of iced coffee I ever had.  I didn't even need no cream or sugar which is something I've never been able to go without in coffee.  The best of all the owner is a very sincere friendly woman who kept great conversation and made my  day just by simply being such a nice person.  If ever in the area please go and support this one of a kind small business.

I am glad to have a sprouts location down the street from me since moving into the area.  I love shopping here, decent prices for a good quality produce.  I prefer to shop here for my everyday groceries over any other grocery store.

Definitely a good good spot to stop for a wholesome lunch.  I enjoyed the variety of meats, veggies, and sauces.  Service was good, food was good, and the price wasn't bad at all.  If I lived closer I'd definitely come here more often.

It has been quite a long time since I've required a cab ride home, however this past Friday night I had a bit to much to drink and needed to do the responseble thing.  For starters getting these people to show up was a joke by itself, then when they did finally arrive the cab literally smelled like some rubbed there back side uo and down the seats....  Smh.  Then to top it off it cost me 31. 00 to get home which was 10 minutes away.  It's definitely cheaper than a dui, but I certainly hope that was the only time I will need to call a cab again.

First and foremost let me say I am very pleased that I decided to go with Arizona pest squads services. I called on a Sunday after reading there already great reviews here on yelp.  Dave awnsered my phone call and was very tentative to our questions making sure he serviced our needs properly.  He came later on in the day on a Sunday when I didn't expect him to, and was extremely professional and courteous to helping us understand his products and services.  He went on to honor a great deal and sprayed our home completely while explaining in detail the service he was providing.  To an added bonus he gave us a complimentary respray to make sure we have a solid hold against any pest.    *Very professional  * outstanding customer service  * great price                I highly recommend this company for all your pest control needs!!!

I enjoyed the atmosphere, very relaxing environment with a friendly staff. I ordered the New England lobster roll because I am born and raised from Boston Massachusetts. I wanted to see if they where producing the same quality we do back home and as i expected not even close, complete let down.  Edible abd a decent lobster roll to the taste, however that's not how they are served back home.  I will return for sure for the wine abd possibly the other food items.

I definitely appreciated the 15% Veterans discount!  As one who served my country it's nice to occasionally feel appreciated for the service we provided to our nation.  It was Sunday so I anticipated a long wait time, but it was worth it.  Service was great and friendly, and the food was good ol fashioned breakfast.
