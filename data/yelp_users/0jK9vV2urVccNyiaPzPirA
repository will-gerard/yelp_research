So pulled up ten minutes before close and the second I pulled up a girl saw me made eye contact and locked the door in a hurry it's just water and ice but dang that's rude and I don't know who is in charge of these kids but they are really helping out the store on Lindsay rd.

I live closer to another water and ice but choose to drive to this location everyone here is friendly and will help you load and unload your bottles and the system they set really makes it less of a chore

ZERO STARS Worst Nordstrom rack experience ever. I shop at Nordstrom for a ton of stuff and most of my clothing items come from here. That being said I'll drive the extra distance to go to Tempe or Scottsdale. I went during clear the rack promotion and I was there shopping for a while. I didn't realize it till time had gone by but the announcement was made that store would be closing. I made my way to the front with a very full cart. I was the last customer in line and the last one to leave the store. I got to the front and was forced to deal with Loretta which is where my trouble started. I don't know who hired this lady but I have never met anyone so rude in my entire life. She clearly was upset that heaven forbid the last customer has a ton of stuff to ring out. She started scanning in a fury and was grumbling through the whole process. She insisted that I separate clearance items and remove my own hangers so the store could close. That is absurd but at the time I didn't mind she was scanning and bagging so fast that I couldn't keep track of the prices going into bag. I'm finally finished I cough up about 1000$. I head through the doors and the sensors go off and Loretta makes her co-workers (who were really nice) look through my bags to make sure all the sensors were removed. Half an hour later I'm finally leaving. Only to get home and realize almost my entire receipt is incorrect everything from being overcharged to missing items and somehow I ended up with a shoe missing. The next day I just returned it all I didn't need the hassle of trying to fix my receipt. I won't shop at this location ever again. LORETTA is a BEAST so steer clear if you choose to shop here. Find anyone but her because the experience will ruin Nordstrom for you. Tempe and Scottsdale are about to be my go to locations.

Worst burger experience ever. Took forever to get our order (30 mins) and when it did arrive it was wrong. They corrected it ten minutes later and when is got to us the fries were greasy and the burgers were too salty

This location is terrible and Bank of America is terrible. They will nickel and dime you for everything and they'll be rude about it. This location has no drive through window and even when you get inside its cold and everyone you can tell just wants to go home.

DO NOT FLY WITH ALLEGIANT THEIR LOW PRICES ARENT WORTH THE HEADACHE OF DEALING AND FLYING WITH THEM  The stewardess was the most ridiculous person I have ever met! I missed the "turn off your phone" announcement due to listening to music the stewardess came by and just picked up my phone disconnected my headset and told me it was confiscated no warning or anything not even the curtesy to realize I missed the announcement. I didn't receive my phone back till deplaned and went to the ticketing desk to retrieve it.  FIRST AND LAST TIME FLYING WITH ALLEGIANT
