My mother and I just stopped in to check it out.  Neither of us had eaten here.  I loved that the menu was small and the food was fabulous.  We of coarse had a milkshake which was awesome!  I was pleasantly surprised, even the waitress was as sweet as their milkshakes.   Very good experience

My mother loves it here, so one day I went as they were doing a promo for breast cancer and wanted a pink extension, well I waited 10 minutes and no one even acknowledged me....there were no clients there, so I'm not sure what the deal was.....  Took my son there 2 weeks ago.  He is almost 2 but very used to getting his hair cut.  The kid chair was broken so the seat belt didn't work, the girl acted irritated to be cutting his hair since he can't sit still for a super long amount of time, then she cut herself and said "Is there any way he CAN be still", I told her no, he's a baby so she continued the cut.  He has devil horns in the front and a little rat tail on the back when I asked for a clean 2 all around and said we like to spike the top, which by the way I can only spike the 2 "horns" Fantastic SAMs hmmmm..  So I call today not expecting a hair cut but rather to let them know how disappointed I am with their services.  We have been really busy so getting the hair fixed was not a top priority at this point.  I asked for a manager and they gave the phone to Ariel who I now found out is not the manager at all.  She basically told me how hard cutting kids hair is, which btw we go to Cool Cuts and they do it all with scissors, this girl barely used scissors...... so yea...... then when I let her know the kid chair is broken she let me know it's not a priority to fix it so they haven't.    My point is they should have just said we are not equipped to cut a child's hair.  No problem I would have taken my son around the corner and got a hair where I wouldn't be throwing money away or dealing with attitude.  I really felt like I needed to let them know, all they had to do was say they weren't comfortable and there would have been no problem, we were already planning to take him elsewhere but they said they could do it.........  So disappointed.

Had a great time here on a Friday night.  Played Songo, which was this really fun bingo game with sons!  It was such a fun time.  We decided to order food and the Tuna sandwhich was so unexpectadly delicous!  I was very pleased.

I have tried this located several times and it seems each time I get a crappier waitor or waitress and worse service than before, which I didn't even think was possible.  Today my meal took so long that I couldn't even eat it there.  I asked for a box and had to take it with me to enjoy at a later time.  I have a whole hour for lunch, I didn't order anything crazy to make.    This place has poor time management skills and is very disappointing.  The only thing good about this place is Zach the manager and Nichole a server.  I guess I should get their schedules and only go when they are working.  What a shame to have such great food and have it ruined each time by poor service.

Tried to go this morning and have gone off and on for years. It's hot in there like stagnant air to start. We asked for a Half order of biscuits and gravy you and were given a full and obviously charge for a full, I asked for a child orange juice and was given a huge to go cup, we have a small child so we asked for extra napkins those never came and they never do every time we've been. Our son started getting a little crazy so we decided it was time to leave my husband asked for it to go cup and was met with a scowl from the other waitress. We won't b back

Best pizza place in town!!! The Nanas pizza is my absolute fave and their canolli is the best I've ever had! They are so sweet in there even the owner is pleasant and just made my first time in even more impressive (my hubby has been picking it up for weeks)
