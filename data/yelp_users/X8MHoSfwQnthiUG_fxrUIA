I used David Brown on a financial legal issue.  When I met with him face to face, he seemed to listen and gave me some advice. I received an email that same day stating he wanted me to write a will, living will, and some other services he provides. I told him we can work on those after my financial dispute is resolved. From there it went downhill.  I called and left messages and emails... No response. His staff were rude (except one lady, dont remember her name) when I tried to call and I always left him a voicemail to call me back. No response.  Two weeks later, he called me back and said he wrote a letter to my debt collector. I called every week to get an update, but no response... Three months later I received a letter that my case was resolved and my case was complete and our relationship has ended... I called to ask what happened and they said it was competed and nothing else needed to be done.  A week later I received another letter that my case was not complete by the debt collector and I called and emailed Mr. Brown's office... You guessed it, no response.  Im just an average person that needed help and I did not get it here.  I am getting another attorney and I would not recommend this office.
