Like everything else in Scottsdale, the prices were pretty high.  Unfortunately, the selection wasn't that great.  There were a few local farmers selling in-season vegetables and grass-fed beef.  There were the other usual vendors selling home-made pastas, honey, hummus, bread and cheeses.  That was about it.  Not really anything to wake up early for...

I have been to this theater twice and even though it is a bit of a drive to get there, I love it!  I love the plush leather chairs, the in theater service and the food selection.  You do have to get there early because the movies do sell out and you want to be able to eat your food before the movie starts.  Some reviews have said that the employees aren't nice or know what they are doing, but both times I was there everyone was very friendly and helpful.

I went to Crudo with some friends for AZ Restraurant week and it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I started with the Butterfish and it was really good.  One of my friends had the Albacore and said he also liked it a lot and another friend had the Mozzarella and said it was the best cheese he had ever had.  I had the squid ink risotto and it was amazing.  Dessert was good, but not great.    The service was also fantastic and I can't wait to go back!

The Gladly doesn't officially open until this Saturday but they had a preview night for people (like myself) who work in the area.  Taking over in the spot that Ruth Chris used to occupy, I am looking forward to eating there often.    Of the small plates that they were serving, my favorites were the scallops and the duck.  Both were fantastic.  The one dish that I wasn't able to sample because it was grabbed almost as soon as it came out of the kitchen was the meatloaf.  Everyone that I talked to that tried it said it was the best dish that they tasted.  I also had the tuna and the chicken pate.  Both were good, but not great.    As for the drinks, I really enjoyed the Thai Margarita but once I tried their Manhattan, I was hooked.  It was by far the best Manhattan that I have ever had.  I also sampled the Salute, a gin and grapefruit drink, but didn't really care for it.  They had a number of other cocktails on the menu that they weren't serving that looked very good and I can't wait to go back and try a few.  Lastly, the service was just as good, if not better, than the food or the drinks.  The staff was very friendly and even though it was the first time I had ever been there, or anyone for that matter, I left feeling like a regular.  I can't wait for the official opening so that I can come back and try the meatloaf and some of the other cocktails on the menu.  Seeing as how I work next door, I have a feeling that this is going to be my new go to spot after work!
