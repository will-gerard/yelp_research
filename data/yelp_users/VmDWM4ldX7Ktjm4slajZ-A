I have been to different doctors in the past and I have to say I am so pleased that I have found Jennifer Francyk P.a. She takes the time to listen and find out what's wrong. You can tell her and the other P.a. and Physicians are passionate about their jobs and they care about their patients. I have had doctors that don't follow up with me and see how I am feeling. But Jennifer cares and she will follow up with me even when she is not at the office. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Jennifer and the people at her office. I promise u wont be disappointed with them and their practice.

Jennica was such an amazing sales lady! She helped me from me getting my wedding dress to my bridesmaids and everything u can think of! She is honest, caring, and she is so helpful! Go to her and see her! If u don't u will be sorry.

Horrible service. They have messed up my order twice. I had to call customer service and complain and they kept messing up my order. It's no complicated to read an order when making a sandwich. Since the one manager left Tom it's not the same place and they don't take care of their customers. Not happy with this place.

Horrible parking lot. Impossible to get gas. Never go there. And if u are trying to leave or get gas people are considerate they block u in or don't give a crap. And they over more then the place off of Tatum and bell.

Walked into this plsce felt very cozy. The staff was very knowledgeable of products and what's good to eat. They offer a Cleanse where all u do is drink the six bottles throughout the day, and u don't eat. U can have raw almonds. The one thing I noticed about the ingredients was they are fresh fruits and veggies. (Kale, ginger, spinach, coconut) etc. ......  for the six bottles of the Cleanse it's 48 dollars.

Super sweet staff. They offered my little princess a free donut. I was totally surprised. They are super friendly and the location is very clean and staffed very well. This made a 2 year old very happy.

Walked in feeling very welcomed and immediately they informed me of amazing information about their products! I loved how the products where all natural/organic! I kid u not they say all their juice aka cloud is juice from the fruit and etc! I felt like they care about their products and they care about the clients who come in! I couldn't be happier with the service! Also I loved how they put the juice on my finger for me to lick and theirs no chemicals its all natural!
