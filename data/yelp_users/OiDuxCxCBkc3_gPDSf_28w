DO NOT TRUST PARROT AUTO REPAIR! Let me start off by saying that I am a very "happy hippie", and I am not easily angered and I do not lose my patience very easily... But this place truly tested my good spirits.   I bought my best friends car, and was told that it needed a lower intake manifold gasket. He is close friends with a very reputable mechanic in Scottsdale, and he was the one who looked the car over and identified the necessary repair. Since I live in Mesa, I decided to take it to a closer mechanic to have it repaired. Upon my perusal of Yelp reviews, I came across Parrot Discount Auto. SInce it had so many 5 star reviews, I decided to call him.   I talked to Ray (the owner) and told him what my vehicle needed. He then told me over the phone that it would cost $500 if it didn't need to have the manifold rewelded, and it would cost $800 if I needed to have that done. Since that was the cost that the initial mechanic estimated, I decided to have my vehicle towed to his shop. Once it was there, he looked it over and called me and left a message and asked me to call him back to discuss the estimate. I was confused since we had already discussed this, but I called him back anyway. He told me during this phone call that it would cost $800 to fix, and it may cost an additional $400 if it needed to be rewelded, but he wouldn't know that until he took the whole thing apart. He also told me that I would need to have an oil change done since it was leaking coolant, and that would cost $50. He said that he was giving me a free oil filter and free oil, so that reduced the cost to "only" $50. He also said that my engine was making a "knocking sound", and that I may need to have more engine work done after all of these repairs.... I asked him why the costs were inflated during this second discussion, and he responded by stating "I can't tell you why the cost is higher, I guess I just didn't think to consider how many hours of labor it would take." Um, what? He had told me over the first phone call he had performed this exact repair many times. I explained I was upset about the increased cost, and he then stated he would give me 10% off since I was a first time customer.... I was still bothered and perplexed, so I told him I would talk to my boyfriend and call him back.  I asked my boyfriend to call and to discuss this with him. When my boyfriend called, he then rambled on and gave him higher estimates than he gave me during both of my previous phone calls with him, and then he even made the statement "I wish I had written the estimate down." Seriously?!!   I then called my friend who directed me to the reputable mechanic who made the initial diagnostic decree on the vehicle, and he said he knew of Parrot, and that he was not a mechanic that could be trusted. He referred me to someone closer to me that was reputable and honest, and so I called and discussed the situation with him. I decided to have my vehicle towed from Parrot Auto Repair to this new shop. I received a phone call from Ray stating that I needed to call him back and let him know when he should begin the repair, and that "the engine knocking noise was not getting any better"... He was actually driving the vehicle around the lot!! Mind you, I told him I had it pushed off my driveway because I knew it shouldn't be driven even a few feet... I was so upset, I immediately had the tow truck meet me at Parrot Auto Repair to have my vehicle towed. Once I got there, I walked into the office and the owner Ray was there. I told him I wanted my car keys and that I would not be having my vehicle repaired at his facility. He then scoffed at me, and said that I owed him money for diagnostics. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was so outraged, I demanded that he hand over my keys or I was going to call the police. This guy is a complete bamboozler, and apparently thinks that he can just take money from people all the while performing questionable business practices. I told him that he had given me several different estimates, and that he had a lot of nerve trying to make me pay to have him tell me what I already knew was wrong with the vehicle in the first place.   Long story short.... DO NOT trust this guy. And DO NOT trust his estimates, or his statements about what you need to have your vehicle fixed. I was so lucky to have this other mechanic look at my car, and fix the problem for hundreds less than he estimated, and they also said there was absolutely nothing else wrong with my car. They also said that anyone would have to change the oil regardless, and that should not be an increased cost for this repair.   STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE! *Especially if you are a female, this guy apparently thinks he can take advantage of you*. I posted my experience on Facebook, and a friend came forward and said Ray had him pay $2k for a job that he didn't end up needing, and that he too got taken by this guy.

Guns etc is by far the best gun store I have been to in Arizona! I say this from experience of having visited quite a few gun stores with either no customer service or crazy prices or both. I have been to AJI, Ted's Shooting Range, Big5 Sports, the AZ gun shows, etc.... Guns etc has them all beat!  This place has great service and great prices along with an excellent staff that is very helpful. It is nice to hear someone who actually knows what they are talking about when it comes to firearms and firearm components. The customer service is top notch. Thanks again for a great experience.

This is a no-frills nail salon. Ask for Tammy. She does a spectacular job at fake nails with gels. I always go back for her to do the fill. It's not a super pretty salon, so don't expect that. But they are affordable, and they will get you in if you call ahead. If you walk in, expect to wait! People complaining about waiting are ridiculous. There are not many nail techs working all at once, so they can't help everyone right when they walk in. You should definitely call ahead with this place.

Ever have such a horrible experience somewhere that you think.... Hmmmm... Is this a hidden camera show? Yep, me too. Except I wasn't, it was just a really bad experience at the Yard House.   I wish I could give it zero stars. Our waitress was named Amanda. Not only did she not bring us our drinks, she described the food as Panda Express-like (gross, I don't eat there), and she also never brought us our food. Instead, she rang in our order and had it delivered to the vegan table next to us. When our food finally arrived, BOTH OF OUR DISHES HAD HAIR IN IT. And my boyfriends order was wrong. And Amanda didn't bring us our food either. She actually only took our order. Then she never said a word when she dropped off the check, or when she picked it up. I was mortified at the whole experience. Please, DON'T eat here. We also mentioned to the manager on the way out how terrible the service was, and he just mumbled an apology. Oh, and we told him this while he was outside smoking. This was just a TERRIBLE experience!!!!

Hair. Bleeeeh! The most dreaded sight while dining in a restaurant. I ordered the turkey sandwich and low and behold I go to take my first bite and there is a medium length black hair inside of it. I was so bummed. It was my first time dining there and the food looked so great. The food runner who had brought me my food came back by and asked me if I was doing okay (obviously I had quite a facial expression), I then told him of the hair. He cringed. He quickly scurried off to get a manager.  A very apologetic manager swooped in and swiftly apologized. I smiled and told her it wasn't obviously done on purpose, but pushed the plate towards her so she would "make it go away". She took the hint and picked it up and asked if I "wanted something else instead". I was starved as I hadn't eaten all day, but I was so sketched out by the h word, I just wanted to run out of there. I just politely declined, and she said she would go refund me my money and return shortly. While I waited I spotted the crowd around the salad bar. I wished I had went that route.   All in all: very nice people, food looked great, but hairnets people- hairnets!!

Great place for lunch in Scottsdale! Free valet parking, and you can also hang out at the pool upstairs afterwards. It's a great way to beat the heat! They have bento boxes for $10-$15. Can't beat a deal like that, especially since it is very fresh fish. Excellent sushi!

This place has gone downhill. I work nearby. We always ordered lunch from here. Last few times have sucked. They forgot to give us all out salad dressing last time along with our nachos condiments, and this time I found a metal wire in my enchiladas from their kitchen sponge. I took the food back with the wire and talked to a manager. He apologized and said he would give me a gift card. He then went to the cash register and pulled out my cash refund and threw it on the bar and walked away. I stood there puzzled. He walked back by and asked me if I needed something. I asked him if he was getting me a gift card and he explained they had run out the day prior, and told me to write my name down so it could be put into their managers book so I could get a free meal next time. The guy had a waxed mustache.   The whole thing was really bizarre and by the most professional way to handle the situation. Why not explain you don't have gift cards? I should also mention that the portion size were about half what they used to be.   This place needs help all around!

The owner reached out to me and apologized for my experience. She had to manager search the take out orders to find my phone number, and called me several times until she was able to get in contact with me. It definitely impressed me to hear how much she cared about my experience. She emphatically apologized, and said they strive to provide an excellent experience for their guests. She offered to make up for this experience by providing a complimentary lunch for both myself and a few coworkers. We ordered various things, and they were delicious and we had no complaints.   Everyone makes mistakes, and it speaks volumes to see the way an establishments handles them. A+ Daily Dose. You regained a lost customer.

This is the place to go for spray tans that don't look like spray tans! First off, I spent a long time researching tanning salons when I moved to Arizona, and was lucky to find MJ through Yelp! I was going on a vacation with my boyfriend, and was whiter than could be! I have only had one spray tan previous to this, and it was a great experience, but I have heard horror stories and didn't want to end up looking like an orange oompa loompa! I sent her a text, and was set up with an appointment a few days later.   The studio itself is glamorous, and very chic. I love the decor, and the overall vibe! MJ herself is gorgeous, inside and out! It is not an easy experience to just meet someone, strip down naked, and then stand with arms raised, legs spread! But she made the whole thing so comfortable! I had no idea what color I wanted to be, so she chose for me. She did contouring, and made me look so naturally tan! Of course the first day the bronzer continues to develop, and I was nervous that I would look too dark, but just like she promised, after I rinsed in the shower, it looked perfect! No streaks anywhere! She also gave me take home instructions of what products to buy at my local Walgreens. She had products there, but she wasn't pushy about selling those, and I could tell that she just genuinely wanted to make me look awesome, and not just sell me products and a tan! The tan looked amazing, and lasted 8 days, and faded naturally! Never streaked!   I just went back again to get another tan for Country Thunder. She did a brazilian this time. The color is absolutely beautiful. I wish I had been born with skin this color, but lucky for me, God created an angel named MJ who could give it to me anyway! I also got a chance to speak with her more this time, and she truly is a beautiful person on the inside too. I started talking to her about other personal image issues I have been working on, and she gave me such genuine and insightful advice. I am so grateful to have found her! She has great recommendations on organic products, and she also performs other services like lash extensions and teeth whitening.   If you are looking for the best spray tan in Phoenix, (or anywhere near), you must call MJ! She also sends out texts with discounted specials, so make sure you sign up for those when you go!

Bomb! Number 34, spicy eggplant. Amazeballs! Fresh basil kicked it up a notch. Love places that offer brown rice. The sauce on the spicy eggplant was insanely delish. Veggies tasted crunchy and fresh. Ordered a side salad and it had ginger dressing that was delish, but the salad was just a bunch of lettuce. At least it wasn't iceberg. Def a place worth coming back to, flavorful and fresh! Not much meat on it, but that's okay. Sometimes it is good to load up on the veggies, especially when they taste this great!

I ordered the Baja roll and a house salad. The fish was not fresh. The server didn't know what kind of tuna it was, but it just didn't taste fresh. He also disappeared for awhile and seemed to go to Starbucks and then take a smoke break, and when he finally came back, he just smelled like cigarette smoke. Gross! The house salad had a ginger dressing that tasted overly spicy and needed more flavor. I sent the roll back. Wouldn't recommend this place at all. If you want good sushi, try Sushi Roku in Scottsdale. Their fish is always fresh.

Godzilla roll! It's amazing. They also have a killer happy hour. It's m-f from 2:30-6:00, open to 5:00 on sat and sunday. Their yellowtail appetizer is also great. The spring salad is HUGE. Very fresh, ask for the ginger dressing though!

DON'T EAT HERE!!   Burnt food..... Four times in a row? I'm the dumb one for giving this place too many chances. We even asked not to burn the food today and apparently they heard BURN IT MORE! :( I spoke with the manager Leslie today and she didn't have any excuse except to say "we are really trying". And we had a coupon that said buy one get one free, after 11:30, and the hostess said it was only good at night... BUT THE PLACE CLOSES AT 3.   This place is just run by a bunch of clowns. I will never eat here again, and you shouldn't either!

I ordered the chargrilled chicken burrito. It was delicious, but so tiny. I ordered the regular size. It should have been made clear that it was actually a kids sized burrito. For $7, it was a complete rip off.

This place is amazing. The best thai food in Arizona! Everything is made to order and very fresh. The owner is the sweetest woman and always comes to say hi before cooking the food. I always get the fresh rolls and the stir fry with chicken and brown rice. It's healthy and absolutely delicious. The portions are also very large. I always share a dish with my mom. Highly recommend!! I also love that the water is filtered.

So grateful to have found him! I accidentally broke my old phone while on vacation, and had tons of pictures on it. I got my new phone under my cell phone insurance plan, and he was able to get the data (pictures, etc). from my old broken phone and transfer it to my new phone. Even the Sprint store wouldn't do it. It was so cheap to! I am so grateful!   Great data recovery, very affordable, this guy knows what he is doing. Super happy girl!

Not a good stylist to work with. I don't recommend doing utilizing Felicia's services. She dyed my hair GREEN! EEEEEK.   So I heard about her on a Facebook site. I went and met with her. She has a sweet demeanor, and she rents her own small space in a strip mall area where there are several other beauty industry professionals of all sorts. I had her dye my hair a few different times. The first couple of times were great. I honestly loved my hair the first few times. Then I had her change my hair to a red/blonde ombre. This is where things started to go wrong.. I had been text messaging back and forth with her as to the color I wanted to do on the top and bottom portion. There were several pictures and videos I sent her. I finally decided on a color scheme based off of an instagram video I found. I showed her the day I met with and the day she dyed the hair. The color came out great, and I loved it.   The problem came when I came in for a touch up. The top of my hair was red, the bottom of the ombre was blonde. When she initially did the ombre, the top was brilliant red, and the bottom was a golden brassy blonde. I loved it and I received a lot of compliments. But then when I went back for the touch up, she dyed the top chocolate brown, and then toned the ends and it ended up being this ashy green weird color. I expressed my disdain, and she just sort of shuffled me out and said she would make a note to dye it a warmer color next time. I left visibly upset. I texted her the next day wanting her to fix it. The top was a super dark chocolate brown (which I never wanted, nor asked for), and the bottom was something from a bad halloween horror movie. I asked her to fix it. I got made fun of by coworkers and they asked how I could have allowed for someone to dye my hair that color. My friends who are hairstylists said that she should take responsibility for it and fix it. I kept reaching out to Felicia, and she kept pushing me off saying she didn't have time to fix it. We actually got into a text message argument over it. She was quite rude, immature and unprofessional. Finally, she said to come in and she would fix the blonde portion, but said she would have to wait to fix the brown because it would damage my hair. So I drove all the way back to her salon, and she fixed the blonde. We then set an appt for a few weeks out for her to fix the top. When it came time for my appt, she text me a few days prior saying she had a family emergency and wouldn't be able to do it, and she wouldn't be upset if I found a new stylist. Um, hello, you were supposed to fix the job you messed up on. The absurd part was she must have forgotten that I followed her on Facebook and Instagram and I could see her posting working pictures the next few days that she supposedly had a "family emergency", and she was even soliciting new clients saying she had availability during the time when she said she couldn't meet with me to fix my hair.   She took my money, but didn't have the integrity to fix the job she messed up on. Then, she was deceitful and dishonest and lied about not being available to fix the job. I ended up filing a complaint against her, and long story short, I got my money back.   BUYER BEWARE. Go somewhere else. She is apparently too busy to remember what color she is supposed to dye your hair, and she doesn't have integrity to fix her own mistakes.

Similar to Paradise Bakery. I like being able to create my own salad. I am a big salad eater, and it always seems like people think I am being high maintenance by either omitting or requesting to add ingredients to my salads. You basically get to pick 5 ingredients, your salad mix, and then a protein. In my opinion it's the perfect portion.  The thing I don't like about the sandwiches is that they only offer ciabatta bread. They should create some sort of whole grain healthy alternative.  They also offer a "recharge bar" where you can plug in your phone/iPad. The only downside is you have to have your own Power cord. Who walks around with one of those? Cool concept though.  The gross part: the moldy rotten chocolate dipped strawberry I received for free. Lol. Gross!

Burgers and hotdogs, and fries, and FRY SAUCE omg. Drool. Calories. Drool. Amazeballs.   We went here after a friend found out the gender of her baby for a celebration of sorts. She wanted meat. This place had meat.   We were a big group, adults and kids. Everyone got something a bit different. Burgers, cheeseburgers, hotdogs, sausage of some sort, fries, and of course FRY SAUCE. I think the fry sauce is just a combo of ketchup and mayo and mustard, but its the bomb diggity. I personally ordered a burger with sauteed onions and mushrooms with no bun, wrapped in lettuce. And obvy the fries with fry sauce. This place is great because you watch the guy cook the food right in front of you. No man hidden in the back possibly wiping his nose while he cooks your food. It's a standard grill and fryer right there next to the cashier.

Was so excited to see this opening near my house! I went today, and I got the Greek salad. Basically you can get anything as either a salad or a wrap, and it's about $5.75 without a protein. To add meat was like $1.75. The ingredients all tasted really fresh! They have a good selection of salad dressings. They also feature a healthy kids menu. Service was friendly. There were 4 cars in front of me, but service was fast. I got the Greek salad, added chicken and avocado. I had my dog with me and the drive thru girl gave her a treat. The portion size was more than I can eat, so it's definitely a great deal. I will be back, and I am so happy to welcome Salad & Go to my neighborhood. We love you already! :)
