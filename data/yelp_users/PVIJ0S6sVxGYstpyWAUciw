This place used to be great, with unique dishes, yummy breadsticks with special butters and complimentary white chocolate for dessert. Now it's just average, with nice outdoor seating.

AJs is my regular Sunday morning coffee walk my florist my gourmet mustard my Karsh's buns my Simply Bread Monkey Bread & Challah (so sad, no more Willo bread) my wine store my salad stop my pizza place (trivia - Chris Bianco used to work the oven here, maybe before it was AJs) my deli my dinner (usually salmon) my fresh fruit & veggies (Utah peaches!)  Staff is happy, making it so pleasant to shop. Jason is a terrific barista!  A few cautions - some out-of-date items still on the shelves (two weeks ago it was eggs) and one barista/bakery worker who has been there for years who just can't get an order done. They also seem to be closing earlier.

Pane Bianco is no secret and I stop here often. I know I have tried other sandwiches over the years, but I crave his tuna. The freshly made bread is fabulous. And on a perfect day, I'll bring the dog(s), catch up with a friend over lunch, watch the time stretch out with coffee and dessert from Lux. Back in the day, we'd also stop in the boutique, pick up some locally made jewelry (or a dress one time).   Every time, I promise myself to save half a sandwich to take home. Sometimes I even wrap it up. But I always eat it before I leave.  Does Chris really remember me from twenty-odd years ago, stalking him to each new place, or is he just being nice?

Twenty five years now I've been shopping at Karsh's. Maybe three owners? Same recipes. New sales help.  What's good? Blue ribbon for the Chocolate Chip Coffee Ring. Absolutely to die for. We even use it for our birthday cakes; any excuse to get one of these luscious, just-one-more-thin-slice-until-it's-gone, cake. So rich and chocolaty. Wow.  What else? In no particular order - challah, onion-poppy bagels, corn rye, pecan sheets, hamentashen, pocket onion rolls, large almond cookie, small butter cookies.  I have had better black & whites;  since I had rugelah in Jerusalem last year, none will compare. Cakes are good, not great; better than Safeway or Costco, and equal to AJs. I think I have tried just about everything here and go with a purpose.  Go for the chocolate chip coffee ring; but don't take the last one, it's for me!

I first took Mary Beth's Mommy & Me Yoga xx years ago. Now I'm back after an intro class. This is a very comfortable place to practice yoga. If you have injuries or medical problems, the intro and gentle classes are excellent. Weight and dress are also not an issue which contribute to yoga's stress relief benefits.  Heidi's intro classes are great (and not too big). But maybe you should try another teacher when you're done with intro; Heidi's other classes tend to fill up . . .

Craving an egg and potato breakfast burrito. Had less than $4 cash in the car, didn't know if Rolberto's sold these so I stepped up to the counter and asked. Yes, and for less than $2.50. No reason to go home for more $$.  Waiting outside in the heat seems to take longer than sitting in the car, but it arrived soon enough. I sat outside on the picnic tables watching some teen boys playing some dragon card game and trading collector cards. Tried to figure out what the creatures were - aliens? monsters? dragons? but never could.  Burrito was fabulous. Been waiting four years for this. Maybe my taste buds have faded? This was very satisfying. For a few moments though, I did think about Norman Fiero, a fabulous Phoenix chef who had a few Mexican restaurants (last one near LGO or pre-LGO). Norman made great breakfast burritos. I digress. . .   Bumping Rolberto's up a star.

I have been a customer of Precision Imports for nearly twenty years, starting with my 1986 Acura Rx. Al and Frank are the nicest, most honest, affordable mechanics I have used. They have checked out my cars before road trips (free) and have even given me a lift home. My neighbors have also been using them for years and won't trust anyone else. I have never felt ripped off or left without understanding what was wrong with my car. Most of my cars are Japanese, but  I had one GM that was so unreliable and so much fun to drive, Frank knew it was me when he picked up the phone.  They do have loyal customers and sometimes get busy.  (Maybe that's why no one has reviewed them before.)

Scott is here almost all the time. I've eaten at Scott's since they opened and have never been disappointed. Scott makes the best LEO (lox, eggs & onions) in Phoenix, has lox spread to die for, and is picky about his bagel supplier. I love the knishes and smoked fishes. He even remembers I don't eat meat. This is also my go-to place for a take-out brunch spread.

Adding my four stars to the Duck & D. I go for a "Nooner" whenever I remember this place. Made to order sandwiches on fresh breads with a crunchy pickle slice and small candy; nice wine selection with helpful wine staff. The Duck has sold gourmet coffee and teas, along with espresso, before it became hip. Great selection of local and gourmet mustards, salsas , sauces, and spice mixes, along with some nice cookware at reasonable prices.  The location is a bit hidden and the patios somewhat awkward. Parking is disappointing. But this is compared to the pre-freeway, Starbucks, etc. Duck & D that had a grassy lawn and large shade trees.

Koller's True Value is OPEN FOR BUSINESS!   The unfortunate fire that closed most of the businesses at the NW corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home (Richardson's, Luci's, Dick's Hideaway) spared this old-fashioned hardware store. By far the best hardware store in the Valley, this store is packed to the gills and has just about everything you could possibly need, including eco-friendly options.  If you can't find it, ask the very accommodating staff.

I love pita, hummus, Mediterranean food and was anxious to try this place. What a huge disappointment. Dressing was over spiced, just burned. Pita was bland.   Glad to see stable something in Town & Country.

I've been to My Florist twice since the redesign (Feb?) and can't find one bad thing to say about it. No more overwhelming loud piano music. I had huge, meal size, delicious salads that made me want to come back for more. The Asparagus and the Tuna Nicoise are excellent. Expecially The Asparagus. I love that salad and I really do hate salad. Both times, we sat there for almost two hours and no one pushed us to leave, even with a line forming, and a bill of about $30.

The food here is SOOOOOOO much better than the nearby State cafeteria.  In fact, the cafeteria failed inspection a bunch of times until it finally was closed for a few days last year to clean up.   Old Station lunch is decent and filling; about equivalent to Subway. I don't get all the rave reviews. I've worked near the capitol for over ten years and only choose Old Station if I'm very hungry and don't feel like driving.

The 25th review of Mary Coyle's. This is the definitive review.  First, MC is NOT hip, cool. urban or pretentious. It IS a Phoenix institution, much like Durants, and you enter through the back. It smells cloyingly sweet when you walk in. It's never even been exactly in a neighborhood either. Formerly on the edge of Encanto, now on the edge of Rancho Solano. Durants is not gourmet food and this is not gourmet ice cream folks. I think it is still  a family business too.  I have always lived near a Mary Coyle, so it's not a special trip for me. I would not make a trip to Sugar Bowl, but it's nice to drop in when I'm in the 'hood.  Mary Coyle is a traditional ice cream parlor with home made ice cream offered in many flavors, but more important, offered in many styles. Don't go in to order a single scoop. You must order a sundae or a banana split or float or some other concoction. Go to savor the blend of layers, the decadence of it all, the freedom of choice (chocolate, caramel, strawberry syrup?).This is a splurge, loosen your belt.  I don't believe the drive thru has ever been open and I've driven by many, many times. The lunch food is pretty good; remember, not gourmet. I've had the chicken salad, tuna and egg salad. My kids have had grilled cheese.  Mary Coyle is fun. It is a family place, kids (t-ball to adult) meet after a game, a date place, anyone with a fun attitude can enjoy a trip to Mary Coyle.   Hint: Since dairy-intolerance hit, I've ordered a banana split without the ice cream. So to all of you who hate to waist (oops, waste) those calories, maybe you do have options. But really, if you insist on always watching what you eat, don't blame Mary Coyle. Go to your favorite frozen yogurt or gelato spot and order your single scoop.  Phoenix needs Mary Coyle. It's a happy place and time before we grew up and had worries.

I had an outrageously delish lentil fetoush salad here the other night with only 15 minutes to eat. Oops, I was late.  What a contrast between this location and the one in Arcadia. It was a Wednesday night. ASU must have been between sessions and it was nearly empty. The decor is what? modern rustic? Is that a theme? It was also a bit dark, possibly a bit dirtier. The gentleman who brought our dishes had a bandaged hand/wrist - how sanitary is that?  I imagine if I came a different time, it would have a much different vibe and the food would be just as great. I love pita jungle. They have great choices and great tasting food, the staff is nice and service is quick.

I love Cibo. I've been here for lunch, dinner and take-out. They have never messed up an order or made anything less than perfect. It's my favorite pizza in Phoenix since I gave up trying to go to Bianco's. One order must be dairy-free and it's never a problem (no-cheese pizzas are a familiar order here). The nutella crepes are heavenly.   I've taken groups, teens, family, etc., it's all good.  Don't go. I don't want to get stuck in a line.

I consistently enjoy Chelsea's Kitchen, even in uncomfortable circumstances (long story). This last time was no exception.  We started with "white" sangria, which none of us had heard of before, despite prior visits. The "white" is a pinot grigio so it was an easy decision to order the pitcher. The sangria was delightful - we didn't quite finish the wine, but the pitcher-ful of fruit was polished off.  My swordfish tacos were delicious and filling. My friend's fried chicken (a special) was good but a bit dry. I suggested gelato after dinner; no one had room.  Service was a bit inattentive. The table seated after us received menus, waters and had their order taken before we had a server approach the table. After the first server, another seemed to take over and things got better.  The atmosphere at Chelsea's is good, as others have pointed out. It's a great place to hang out. The setting is beautiful. I will return.

Can't wait to go back for more discoveries.  When I was in Jordan last year, I picked up 2 lbs (or whatever their measure) of assorted baklava for $6 and ate it (with a little help) in five days, while losing ten pounds. Got all that? The baklava diet. Gotta love it.  So I went to Baiz hoping for some more amazing baklava. Bought the 1 pound assortment for $16; two weeks later, still some left.  It's delicious, pricier, definitely not dietetic, and not quite the same as Jordanian baklava. Still yummy.  Also had the hummus, baba ghanoush and pita. Loved the hummus and pita (very fresh).

Genuine upscale restaurant - good food, service and ambiance. I usually order the fish, but occasionally order two appetizers instead. The Maitre' D always lets the waiter know we have a limited time to eat before theater; the waiter makes sure we order something that can be done within that time.   They validate our parking from dinnertime through the end of the play, an extra bonus, even if it is a bit of a walk! If you want to make going out downtown a special event, this is a good place, although I wouldn't make Kincaid's the only destination.  Always in our theater rotation.

This is the best kosher market in the Valley. Outside Arizona you might find a better selection, but this is the best here.  Imperial is run by Dad and two sons. Everyone is friendly and helpful. No attitude. Many places will treat you like you're ignorant if you aren't a regular and need to ask questions. Not here. Genuinely nice guys.  It is a very small shop, nearly crammed with goodies without being overstuffed. They carry the complete Simply Bread line. Sometimes they run out of these items, but they will let you know when the next delivery will be. The challah rolls make for great sandwiches. Deli meats include a large variety of turkey based products, so it's possible to avoid beef if you like.  Turkey breast, smoked turkey breast, turkey salami, turkey pastrami, turkey bologna, etc.  They also make sandwiches to go but I've never had one.  In addition to the usual stock of Kosher food, the owners import several fresh Israeli foods, including hummus. This is the main reason for the fifth star. The imported selection is great fun and discovery. Unfortunately, the choices are not always predictable, so I might go in for hummus and it won't be there, but something new might have come instead. There are also Israeli spices, jams, chocolate (including dairy-free chocolate), and wines. Breakstones whipped butter and Temptee cream cheese are in the cold case.  I also like that they package fresh chicken wings. I used to buy the IQF wings, but they are never as good as fresh. A good BBQ sauce and wings. Thank you Imperial Market.

Uptowne Cleaners is excellent. Clothes cleaning is exceptional, Dave Silliman is a darling (check his website), and the staff is always pleasant.   I didn't think I would be satisfied when Maroney's closed nearby, but Uptowne is better. My friend drives from Anthem to bring her best clothes here. I've even seen a few high profile Phx residents with their exclusive designer wear more recently. (But don't let that stop you.)  ps I have tried the so-called "Organic Cleaners" and they have ruined some of my clothes. I am apparently allergic to the "all natural" solution; once it's in your clothes, it just doesn't come out.

Based on my one dinner, I would eat here everyday if I could. I want to try everything! It is a vegan paradise. Now I've never been to Jamaica, so I don't know the "real" deal, but I've been to Caribbean restaurants.  We shared the Avocado Plantain Spring Rolls, but I think we could have each finished our own - they were simply that good. The person I went with usually eats "like a bird," barely tastes her food and leaves food over. Not here, unless you consider a vulture a bird. Wow, I've never seen her go for food like this!  She ordered the Pop Cho and Sweet Ginger, loved it and finished the entire serving. Didn't care for the cabbage side which she found too peppery. Note that the "sweet potato" that comes with this dish is actually a regular potato prepared sweetly, so adjust your expectation. It's still qute good.  She liked my dish too, but said hers was better (a bit competitive too).  I had the Coconut Curry Tofu. It had amazing and unique tastes, Absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, we had no room for dessert. But I have no doubt I'll be back again soon for more!  This will soon be part of the pre-theater rotation.

Real NY pizza made by New Yorkers. Been my favorite pizza for years. Perfect crust, perfect sauce and perfect proportions of sauce and cheese. Absolutely satisfies the pizza craving. Tons of topping choices, including anchovies (my fave, not always available in Phoenix).  It's a tiny storefront located vertically in a strip just north of Glendale before 19th Avenue. You can't really see it from the street. There are a few tables if you want to eat in and check out the menu. I've never eaten at the restaurant.  If you're calling in an order, you'll immediately realize that most customers are regulars and know exactly what they want. They expect you to get down to the business of ordering right away; kinda no nonsense like a New Yorker. But if you ask for help and understand they'll need to put you on hold to take other orders, you'll get your questions answered.   So save the airfare; get your NY pizza here!

This used to be Johnson's Cleaners, an excellent, long standing, Phoenix dry cleaner, with a knack for repairs. I gave the new owners a few tries and it was a disaster.   Just because something is allegedly "organic" does not mean it's healthy. Turned out I am extremely allergic to the chemical or "natural" ingredient in the dry cleaning solvent. I broke out in hives up to my face by the time I got to work; I have never had a reaction to anything like that before and it took a few weeks before I realized it was the clothes that had been dry cleaned at this shop. Since then, I've tried to wash the clothes that are washable fabrics (e.g., linen) and changed to Uptowne Cleaners, but I never could wear some clothes ever again.  Since I changed dry cleaners, I haven't had any more hives.

We belong to the "clean plate club!"  With the mixed reviews on Yelp, I was hesitant. But we needed to change our theater night to Saturday during the NRA Convention, so we wanted to secure a downtown parking spot early. District offers 3 hour free valet parking.  The restaurant was not crowded when we arrived or left even tho downtown was packed. Lots of large groups here. It wasn't especially contemporary looking as I expected; more typical of a hotel restaurant. The waiter (Orlando) was cute and attentive to our 8pm theater time.  I ordered the Pseudo Stroganoff; a vegan dish made with seitan that was quite good. My theater pal had the pork tenderloin with mac/cheese and applesauce. The applesauce was more like apple syrup, but she raved about the tastiness of her meal too. We both agreed that we would definitely go back. The food was reasonably priced, well executed, and the service was as it should be.  ps no more sweet potato tots.  (Spell check says I have errors, so I apologize; but it doesn't offer alternatives.)

Burnt, bitter espresso.   Bitterly disappointing. This place has so much potential, the pasties look yummy. I ordered my usual, an iced triple soy latte, to jolt me awake and fend off the morning headache. (Not iced in the winter.)  This was not drinkable. I will not be back.  Fair Trade Cafe, Lux, AJs,(even Starbucks), I am so sorry I cheated on you.

Small shop, nearby, and I was a very hungry vegan. Ordered two smoothies with companion. Smoothies were delicious however they cook 30 minutes (yes, really) to make. We had ordered small sizes and it seemed like so little for such a long wait. There were at least three staff working and only two other tables.  Disappointed.
