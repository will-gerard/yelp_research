I have been coming here for years and it is my favorite place to go. Even when I was no longer living in Mesa I would drive here to get my nails done. They always do a wonderful job and I have never had one bad experience in the 6 plus years I have been a customer. My mother, grandmother, and several friends are also loyal customers and I am sure they feel the same. They also are the best price in the area. Thank You Mike and Bailey!

I give two stars for a decent wash. I got the basic wash it was 14.99. As soon as you pull up they are trying to upsell you and get you to replace your windshield. Even when they were giving me my car back they tried to get me to have my leather seats detailed. I find this very annoying and if I shouldn't have to say no thank you more than once. I had to ask to have the marker they write on your window washed off. They also missed bird poo that was on my door. My door handle was broken prior to going in but they hid the handle under my seat and when I asked where it was they tried to say it wasn't there when I arrived. I don't like being called a liar. Will not return.

I can not wait to come back here! I was worried when I moved about finding a good nail place. I love Dolly! She is so nice and calls all customers by name. She also gave me the best pedicure I've ever had. Prices are fair and salon was very clean.
