Terrible. Wings arrived cold, spaghetti tasted like they opened a can of tomato paste. French fried in old oil grease. I will admit the 8" bar pizza and the Shock top was good but one can't ruin that.  As I was posting this/or the tip was up for discussion suddenly, the waitress whom never had time to talk to us apologized about some of the deficiencies. Not sure if Cheryl was being genuine or fishing for a tip but the timing was off.

MV Motor Care was very helpful in getting my car in, they were also courteous and patient. MVMC has great reviews and I agree this is why I chose to take my car there. Unfortunately, my outcome has not been so nice to put it presentationally. We are still in dispute from the services received from August of 2014 to what I feel was un-authorized and to what Dawn DiMarco felt was authorized work. Although she has offered for a $100.00 off for the future installation of an alternator it is hard for my husband and I to return to MVMC. We hope the owner will see things from our perspective as a business owner that has dealt with customer satisfaction for over twenty years.

Always good, hot and fresh. Never old and never too old to go eat at. The place is still run down but the food compensates for the surroundings. Prices are still cheap compared to other Mexican restaurants.

Homey atmosphere, very good selection of beers with European selections. Okay customer service but high turnover but terrible food hygiene. Worst yet, denial by the owner that it couldn't possibly be theirs even when you see a young gentleman in the back with long hair (in his defense he was wearing a hairnet but the hair was in the batter). Absolutely zero address to the hair that was fried in with the fish to us. They did ask if I wanted another serving as I declined with a grimace but they still had the audacity to charge me full price. After I told them "c'mon at least take off the fish, the owners disputed amongst themselves again of what to do, really loud so I can hear them as they look at me. Then the wife comes up to the register rings up a new check and leaves, again not a word, no apology. The new guy that's only been there two weeks tells me the new amount is 20% off excitedly yet NO APOLOGY! This place cannot afford to compensate fish much worse any apologies whatever happened to good ole customer service?   PS. My husband and I initially believed their denial "it's not us we don't have long hair" till the long hair dude came out he said he didn't have a hairnets at all at that time!

Il Posto is a restaurant my husband and I frequent after we moved into the Moon Valley area. The outside patio is cozy especially when the fire is burning and the weather is chilly, combine that with a nice bottle of red wine and it creates a warm and comfortable ambience.   Last Friday's dinner the atmosphere was just right, the sounds of cutlery, dinner chatter and my husband and I were gearing up to enjoy our favorite, the seafood house special and meat lasagna-until we learned the restaurant had been sold. Our experience with our server Devon was hands down the best yet we were leery of the change. As patrons we questioned the intentions of the new owner and we were doubtful, but by the end of the evening we had a change of heart.   The new restaurant owner, Executive Chef 'Ziggy' was wearing a maroon colored, double-breasted culinary jacket, he appeared fresh-faced and excited and his energy exuded charisma. I watched him crank up the fire pit to enhance our dinner experience and to our delight he suggested background music which we definitely agreed. He also expressed fresh ideas yet maintain the winning menu with a few tweaks here and there and even attested to staying faithful to the true character of "her" meaning the restaurant, as he looked around at his new haven.   Immediately, we took a liking to him especially as we watched him in action with the guests. He was courteous and welcoming from young to old, he demonstrated genuine appreciation for the patrons and reminded folks to sit down and relax. After all, that's why we come out to dinner right?  Needless to say, we enjoyed our experience that night and felt the future of Il Posto will not only continue to thrive but exceed success. We are excited and ready for the fresh energy and the few new faces, yet experience the same great Italian food on planet earth. This is a must try-period.

I have not personally used this mechanic shop for my car however while getting an over the phone estimate they were honest and fair. Our truck's motor completely went out, they suggested a few options which I like a lot! I called four other mechanic shops and they quoted me much more compared to Carmel's Automotive. Ben was patient with me and even suggested if the truck is at a loss they will wait for a tow truck to come pick it back up. My husband and I are pretty sure it's the motor and may not even be worth diagnosing and paying for tow pick-up and return but either way it was nice to have support by them. In the meantime, anyone interested in a project truck? Cheap!

We just bought a house in Moon Valley and was very excited to try Times Square especially to have them as the life long diner. Very disappointed. The service was very slow due to a couple parties. This was the excuse the Manager gave as part of her defense when I asked  for some sort of compensation after waiting for lengthy time for our food. The Manager could not afford an apology or some sort of discount, worse yet she argued "the food was warm wasn't it?". My reply was simple, I'm sorry your business cannot afford customer service so we just won't come back here again. To make matters worse she walked away nodding her head NO. When we were still hospitable by paying our bill and paying the tip to the waiter whom was apologetic and walked with integrity she was standing across the restaurant STILL nodding her head NO.   Yelp, do you have a video tape upload option? If so, her reaction was astonishing. Experience never compensates for bad customer service, she may know what she's doing on the job but she forgets who she's doing it for, the customer.
