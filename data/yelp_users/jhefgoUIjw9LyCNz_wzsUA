Im just going to start by saying I was mid chew and felt something stringy, i pulled it--- it was a 5inch piece of fine, light brown hair. Disgusting.  Aside from the aforementioned additional topping, my pizza looked like it was thrown together by five year olds, with maybe 5-8 pieces of each of the 4 toppings I requested. That toppings being pineapple, mushrooms, jalape√±o, and pepperoni. I might as well have ordered a cheese pizza and put the toppings on here at home.  So I called the store. The manager asked if I wanted a replacement, adding that the remainder of the pizza needed to be returned. I should have had them come get it, because I definitely will be throwing the additional 5 slices in the trash. I told her no, because I really would prefer not to ingest anything else from this establishment. She never once suggested refunding the money for the pizza, but instead a credit for next order. I took the credit(which must be used in 60 days). If anyone wants it feel free to let me know, I will not be eating here again.  I gave one star because my pizza got here on time and the delivery driver was nice.

Ive come to Phillys quite a few times and tonight was the worst. Jay---- the manager, was here tonight and a total douche. I bet he doesn't even know i know his name.   At any rate, how can you as a business owner, tell a person on the phone..." We close in 45 minutes or so..." Not to mention, it being 9:48p at the time of this call. Okay soooooo, do you not want patronage and revenue at your business for the next 45 min? We went anyway just to make a point.  Sir, Jay... You should not storm like a bull towards my table. You have to be a work, make the best of it. I don't have to be at work, so i really feel you! Next time, ask me for my ID. Don't say, "you guys don't have your IDs do ya?" Of course we do you fool, we came to a bar. Bottom line, if you didn't want to be here until close of "10:45" tonight, you should have staffed appropriately.

So tonight was CONFUSING. I walked in, gave my name, waited by the bakery. My name was called. I was told to walk upstairs. I waited AGAIN upstairs. And then asked to sit in an overcrowded, stuffy, overflow room.  And get this, the table was a small 2 top right outside of the kitchen. Literally, 3 steps out of the kitchen. Lord forbid a waiter trip or a cup of coffee slip off of a tray, scolded wouldn't even be the word.  Myself and my guest I was with, just left.   As we walked down the grand staircase, we walked past a manager that didn't even take the time to say goodbye or ask about the meal. The gentleman that directed us upstairs didn't even take the time to ask why we were leaving so soon, but instead "I hope you enjoyed your meal!" Bro, we weren't even here for more than 10 minutes.  Ultimately, I get that this location in Vegas is busy, but why is that? Cheesecake factory is a staple in every major city, patrons will eat there no matter what city they are traveling to.  But what i don't get is how the customer service can waiver between the different locations.  Just because the Vegas location stays packed from open to close, shouldn't mean that the hostess cannot take an extra moment while asking a name, "just to let you know, we are seating in the upstairs overflow room, is that okay? Or would you prefer to wait for a table on the first floor?"  This one question would have given me a 5 star experience because I would have elected to walk up approximately 42 stairs and sit in a separated environment.

Seriously, the most friendly business I have EVER been to. As soon as we walked in we were made to feel like family. The owner started to chum it up w my friend who is also Arabic. They even gave her the 10% discount without using the check in.   The food is very international and bursts of flavor. The gyro meet is crispy on the edges, the fries are seasoned well, and the salad was put together with crunchy veggies, feta and balsamic. I really respect the use of real plates, bowls and silverware. But most of all, coming to my table to ask how the food is AND engage in conversation.  ALSO, the store has its own grocery marketplace. The store has items you wouldn't typically find in your local grocery store. There is Arabic food, fresh produce and goat milk. I left this experience feeling very cultured and love the fact that we stumbled upon this gem. I don't live on this side of town but any time I am over here, I will be back.

I first have to start with saying I just moved to Las Vegas from Arizona and was apprehensive to come here because I only go to one nail tech. I should have went with my gut.  Polished is like a little factory, and for as many people working in there--- I should not be sweating or hot while inside your establishment. But thats not the kicker... I was bounced into two separate techs chairs because no one wanted to file off a clear coat of gel overlay and the loose powder underneath. The second nail tech filed off the clear gel, leaving the glitter, to say she would put acrylic over that, followed by a polish color. UHM WHAT?  I asked her to put a coat of clear gel back on my nails and walked to the reception desk. I spoke with a very nice gentleman who walked over to tell the owner about the situation. Rather than her asking me to come over and explain, better yet ASK TO SEE MY NAILS to assess from a professional opinion--- she proceeded to curse saying "well is it on there fucking thick, its gonna cost extra," and multiple eyerolls, they were going to sit me in yet another persons chair. I politely declined and left the establishment.   I will not be back. Customer service from the manager could have completely saved this experience, especially since she walked right past me while sitting in the first techs chair. I guess when you have 20 people working in your establishment at a time, you could care less about the one person who drove nearly an hour to get to your establishment and give your business money. I am giving one star only for the gentleman who tried to help multiple times.   Very unpolished experience.

Open on a holiday  Professional   Wasn't expecting this type of experience. Hardly ever order take out, so I was just waiting for disappointment. I was taught to expect the opposite from now on.  If you like the perfect amount of spice, order medium. And if you like eggs like I do, you may have to request extra.  Whoever took my order, I appreciate you. Not only did you verify my address and make sure you had a gate code, you made sure my order was just like I wanted it. I didn't know the address at my current location and you waited ---patiently. Seriously, some people can just 5star an experience because they are just awesome.  Even the man tastebuds gave "this is really good," and we all know that doesn't happen often.  Thank you:)

Tonight i went to El hefe for tacos. That turned into me using the bathroom. Which turned into me using the air hand dryer and having to touch the bathroom door handle in order to exit. I attempted to speak with the general manager to at least ask for paper towel to be put in the ladies restroom. The security guard then decided to butt in and say "theres toilet paper, cant you use that?" I emphasized that that isn't the point.   The general manager not only ignored my request but also rolled his eyes as if what i was requesting was going to come out of his paycheck. I have eaten and patronized EL Hefe several times. But i probably wont be back.

Today was great. I found a new favorite nail salon through Yelp! I initially called in, just to get prices and ended up setting an appt and leaving my phone number --something I never do. From the second I stepped inside I felt welcome. Tai helped me decide on colors because I am so indecisive. I'm pretty picky too so I appreciate him spending the time to ask me "do you like them, you better tell me?" By the time I left I met Rick and Q who also had the same inviting personalities. To add, don't be worried abt the meters, call beforehand to ask abt a parking pass. Ill be back every 2 weeks.

Stopped in today for happy hour and it was the perfect wind down. $5 well cocktails, wine and tapas. The vibe is really Miami-esque, with white furniture, dim lighting and colored light to accent. However, I've never been to Miami---i imagine it to be like this. Even better, theres lounge music playing that isnt so loud i cant hear the person sitting next to me. Perf.  Our bartender Michael was really nice, knowledgable of the drink menu and requests, and extremely efficient.  We ordered the pesto edamame, a little salty but the flavors were right on. Ive never had the combo together before, but ill certainly have it again. Our other order--- the soup gyoza... An explosion of flavors in my mouth. The slice of ginger on the bottom of the dumpling? Mannnnnnn listen?!   Ill definitely be back. Thanks sochu!

Dude. I am so happy. You know how sometimes, you go to a place for the first time and expect the visit to be nothing but great? Well, so far I have received nothing but THAT!  AND they play hip hop:) NOT RAP---hip hop. There is a difference.   Brewing all of their beers here, and when they run out--- THEY MAKE SOMETHING NEW. Certainly a refreshing experience and I will be back.

Today would have been my second time eating at The Montauk. But that didnt end up happening.  Upon walking in, the hostess did not make eye contact and was completely rude. Im used to walking in and being greeted. "Welcome to Montauk," nope, just "how many?" Kinda starting to get that vibe the more I come to Scottsdale.  She left to go clean off a table, and another hostess approached. No smile, eye contact, or nothin Jesus! After hostess #1 returned from cleaning the table she told hostess #2 "its done." We were then walked to the table, our menus were placed on the table and off she walked.   The waitress came and didnt say "hello" either. What the fuck? These girls here really need some training on hospitality and possibly manners. We asked for water to start, took about 5 mins to get that. THEN we ordered drinks from the bar, took 10 mins to come back with that. We left. You can keep your drinks and your shitty service.   Ill give you 1star because I like the way the decor looks in here.

First I would like to point out the amount of space available here, in comparison to the starter location. More space did not create an inflation in prices, instead remaining true to quality of services, products and affordability.  It is very easy to get in and scheduled for an appointment. All of the staff are friendly, listen, and like to know you on a first name basis. EXPECT to have a conversation throughout your services.  There are over 500 polishes to choose from and that does not include gel. There's probably about 300 of those. And don't forget the loose glitters, rhinestones and other nail add ons. The pedi chairs are fully functional, along with cleanliness and use of a fresh sanitary bags for each client.   Nails by Males is a salon of care and nail health and I will continue to give my business and refer others.  Oh, by the way, APPOINTMENTS RECOMMENDED
