Culture! Now I have had my cultural experiences in my past, and it has made me stand a little more upright and eat more with utensils. With that said, I have reached an all time high, or low (to some), by going to the Nutcracker with my GF. As I entered the Phoenix Symphony I had to wind my way thru little girls in poofy dresses and lost men with their girlfriends. The entrance is somewhat plain, but once you enter the hall you feel like you blew it by not wearing your ascot. Needless to say I was very entertained by the Nutcracker and the Ballet Dancers and Symphony were fantastic. I am very surprised that little girls don't get creeped out by the Nutcracker guy. I see that thing come to life and I'm running!  Oh yeah, now I know what the hell a Sugar Plum Fairy is too!!!

For a good hang over destination, Rosita's is the place for me. Bean and cheese burrito with green chili is the perfect stomach soother.   Chips are a little to greasy for me, but the salsa has the perfect temp. I like it a little hotter ie (los dos molinos). The only other item I have had at Rosita's is the chimi. Also good, but if you are a bean and cheese fan, the beans are some of the best in town. That probably also means they are some of the more unhealthy beans in town.

Love this place! Whether you need a birthday plate with some odd candy on sticks, Pinata whacking sticks, Mexican Sun Hats or Non FDA Approved Drugs this is your place. I have found myself spending a good 30 minutes perusing stuff that any middle aged Irishman needs. I have pleased many family and friends with Pico Rico Birthday Plates!!

I flippin love this place!!! I have a weird love for Mexican Markets and this place kicks ass!!! You walk into this place and bam! Mexican Sweet Breads!! Oh, it's just starting there. Grab a few sweet breads (good luck trying to figure how it do it in a sanitary way) and make your way to the CANDLES!!! Yeah, they got every imaginable candle. Picked up a Pope John Paul candle and what's that? A wall of chicharones. Now I don't eat those, but shit they are very impressive! Now my A.D.D. is kicking into high gear!!!! Tortillas, salsa, tamales, more candles, crazy ass looking fruits, crazy ass looking marinated meats, I don't know what that is and my 4 years of Spanish isn't helping me read the label, pacifico, corona, tequila and so so much more. Phoenix Ranch Market is my Disneyland! Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

The Desert Botanical Garden is hands down the greatest place to get away in the city. 5 reasons you need to become a member.  1. The beauty of our Desert Landscape. The park is so well laid out with numerous spots to sit and relax whether under a cactus or mesquite tree or by one of the numerous water features thru out the park.   2. The Fall concert series. The Garden brings in great musicians at night under the stars in the cool Phoenix air. Enjoy a bottle of wine, Spanish guitar and nibble on the catered Arcadia Farms. We have so much fun at these events and try to make as many as we can.  3. Dia de los muertos. Another great event held at the Gardens. We had a blast as the Gardens goes all out celebrating the day of the dead. Amazing food, local artist, theater and the final procession.  4. Chocolate and Chili Festival. Yes, they go great together. Tons of Chocolatiers and music. A must for any chocolate lover.  5. The Luminaries (Holidays). Had the greatest Christmas memories enjoying the large number of musical groups and beautifully lit luminaries (Yes with candles, don't know how long it takes to light those). This will get you in the Christmas/Holiday mood.  The Desert Botanical Gardens takes the beauty of the harsh desert environment and turns it into an oasis filled with music, spirits, food and light. We will be members for as long as we live here.

Not your ordinary sandwich!  Now I have read some of the comments that the sandwiches are over priced, or should I say more expensive than most sandwiches. Well, this isn't your typical deli. First off, if you can finish the whole sandwich I am impressed. I have a hearty appetite and I am perfect with just half a sandwich. That is another half for another meal. Talking dollars here. Now let's break down the Pane Bianco creation:  Fresh Ingredients: There is nothing more important than fresh vegetables, cheese and meats. Pane Bianco hits the mark on this qualification.   Seasoning: Love the dressing they used on my Soppressata sandwich.   Bread: Good luck finding a better bread for your sandwich. Delicious and right out of the oven.  Atmosphere: I like it. I know some people had issue with it, but this place is about a simple menu with a simple process to get you seated and eating ASAP.   My favorite place for a $5 sandwich. Yeah, there is enough for two meals!!

OLD SCHOOL CC!! You feel like you step back in time at this club. Now everything is in pristine updated condition, but the club itself has that old time CC feel and swagger. The service is top notch and the attention to details is on point. I didn't see Ty Webb or Judge Smails here, but I'm sure this would be a place for them. Tennis courts are in perfect condition and the golf course is a PHX classic! So, just snake a tube down her nose and I'll be there in four or five hours. I am enjoying Phoenix CC!

Mediocre at best. Not too tasty. Salsa blah, beans and rice too salty. Only thing I feel confident in recommending is the Mexican pizza app w/ chicken. Big enough to share.  Other than that, the price is too expensive for the food served.

I typically like to use local businesses but was let down a bit by the one previously used.  I had to get a large job done quickly and correct the FIRST time so I took the chance on AlphaGraphics and pleased to admit that they were extremely efficient, understanding to my needs and went above and beyond to make sure all my questions and concerns were addressed.  For the job I needed done I was expecting at least 3 business days.  I was told it may take only 24 to 48 hours to complete it however, they were done in UNDER 24 hours which was surprising and so very much appreciated.   They were extremely professional and offered money saving and time saving suggestions.  I'll definitely be using this AlphaGraphics in the future for all my printing needs.

This is the second time I have been here and I didn't write a review the first time because i wasn't that impressed. We wanted to give this place another try because our friends loved it.   I had the Stoner Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely delicious. So a sushi place selling a buffalo chicken, lettuce, ranch and rice bowl.   Yeah, it seemed like something you would eat after a late night of drinking. Very impressed. Huge portion of chicken, just a touch of ranch and white rice that goes perfect. I will be back again. Just shows you that you should always give a place a second chance.

Phoenix City Grille is a great place for family and friends. Despite the draw back of being in a strip mall, the ambiance inside is very warm and welcoming. Instantly you will get the urge to enjoy a cocktail or in my case a Martini. PCG only gets better with the food. Classic comfort foods with a little southwest twist. The Griddle Corn Cakes were fantastic. You can definitely order that appetizer as an entree. I had the green chile burger and it was delicious. I don't think you could go wrong with any of the dishes on this menu. We will be back soon and often.

Copenhagen was a great find. Even though we have seen it about 100 times driving up and down Camelback. Best selection of sofas we have seen to date. Great selection of contemporary classics and Natuzzi.  They also have a more affordable section called Denmark. We finally found our sofa and chair! Great price and the service was the perfect combination of helpful and respectful of our space.   We will shop here first for all of our home furnishings!

Oh, the MercBar!! Had many a forgotten nights at this dark upscale dive bar. Once again I'm reviewing a place years after my first visit. I finally had a night that I remembered to give that review. Had a nice going away night with some of my close friends and only moscow mules were being ordered. Always a safe choice for my brain and body.   Here are just a few things I love about the MercBar:  1. Noise level - The ability to be able to talk to those you're with. Nothing is more annoying than going to a bar where you can't talk over the noise or music.  2. Great seating and lighting- The bar is set up with couches and chairs in the main room with some bar stools up at the bar. Lighting is a little darker which is nice if you come here with a date. 3. Cocktails - The bartenders know what they're doing here. Now I may be giving them more credit than they deserve since my drinks are things I can make, but every cocktail I've had there is on point!  4. Close for my drunk ass - I can almost stumble home, but I think I'll take a $5 uber!  Love the fact I've started a business over cocktails in this place! MercBar will always be remember by this guy. Well, it will now!!

Squaw Peak Animal Hospital is a great little neighborhood Vet's office that treats your dog like their own pet. My dog Duffy has seen most of the Vet's at Squaw Peak and that little beagle is comfortable with all of them.   Duffy was diagnosed with a tumor a couple weeks ago and I have put off writing a review on Squaw Peak in the past, but with the amazing service and compassion I knew it was time to give them the 5 stars they deserve.   Anytime Duffy needed something done I was always asked if I wanted to watch them. They are an honest caring office that first and foremost are concerned with your pet. They don't look for add on procedures or up-sells.   Look forward to your new location across the parking lot. That was the only downside to SPAH.

Yelp and Capital Grille, hats off!!! Great event, food, new friends and cocktails.   Capital Grille: I have been to The Capital Grille many times in other cities (Chicago, D.C, and Denver) and the food is always tops and the service is beyond that. We didn't expect anything less. So no more than 5 feet thru the door we were drinking red wine and munching on lobster rolls. Not bad, not bad at all. The next 5 feet we found ourselves tasked with another food rendezvous of crab cake or filet sandwiches. Well we went with both. Yeah, don't judge! The filet sandwich was absolutely delicious and the crab cake had a little kick with a red pepper seasoning. Yum!! Most people would take a break, but not us. We moved on to the red pepper soup and truffle fries. Both amazing!! The fries were like a good steak, no need for sauce or ketchup. Food was excellent. The staff was even better. This being a free event you would think that the service would be a little sub par. Not at the Capital Grille. The service was spectacular. Even had a waiter give us a biz card to call him ahead of our next visit. Great touch! Capital Grille will be my new steak house of choice!!!!  Yelp: You guys did such an great job putting this amazing event together. Lindsey and Gabi it was so nice to finally meet you. Thanks for the fun afternoon and we look forward to seeing you at the next event.

Kettle One Martini's with Blue Cheese Olives, Medium Rare Steak and a dark bar! Yeah, there is a pretty good chance you will find me in a place like this. I am drooling as I write this review. The Capital Grille at the Biltmore is the perfect place to take a break from shopping. Sit at the bar and have a couple cocktails and some calamari and you will be ready for some more shopping with the gf. Could be dangerous shopping if you have one too many FYI.

I love going anywhere I'm the youngest one in the joint. Okay, not the youngest, but the youngest customer. Keegan's is a great neighborhood restaurant that puts out honest pub grub. No fancy, deconstructed shit here. You want potato skins, you got it! You want saffron dusted potato croquettes with bacon infused butter? Go somewhere else fancy boy!! They have a wide range of items on the menu and their specials are always worth the visit. Meatloaf day is one of the better ones! Just like Mom's.   My list of favs 1. Beer (I know you can get that anywhere, but I like the bar here, great bartenders) 2. Potato Skins (Duh, I talked about them earlier) 3. Calihan Cobb (Basically took a couple meats and mixed it in with some greens. Nothing wrong with that) 4. Turkey Burger (Better than Delux, need I say more) 5. Any of their cobblers   On St. Paddy's day they put up a strong corned beef! Just a wee bit of info for ya.

Cole Haan has always been a trusted brand for me. I have had numerous pairs of dress shoes and years of comfort and style. I was so happy to see the Cole Haan store at the Biltmore.   Okay first let me say that I lived a long time in San Diego so my attire is usually a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. The Cole Haan store has a more upscale feel to it when you go in. I felt way under dressed as I do a lot of times. Hahahaha. Hey I like comfort. Well you would have never thought I was dressed like a beach bum.   The sales team was very attentive and helped me find the perfect pair of boots for my girlfriend. Even offered me some water. Nice touch. Found a better deal than the Cole Haans in Macy's. Always a plus. I will be back again.

I am so fortunate to live near this 36 hole course. The Adobe is a more traditional course with forgiving fairways and greens. The Links course encircles the Biltmore homes and will give you a better challenge with awkward lies and elevated tees. The courses can play very slow so you may want to try playing later in the day. You can't beat the rate if you live in the valley and the course is always in great shape for the amount of play.   Staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant offers great food at a reasonable price. I would stay clear of the course on the weekends in the morning. You will play a 5+ hour round.

Great go to place at the Biltmore. The quality and service is always right on. I have never had food at Hillstone that I didn't love. Now, they don't publish their contents and calories of their dishes so I may be loving some heavy caloric meals, but it is worth those calories. Houston's turned Hillstone has been a great change in atmosphere as well. From a dark ordinary layout to an open architecturally stunning restaurant.   Must haves:  Artichoke App Filet Mignon Any Salad Fish Sandwich Cobbler Kettle One Martini up with Blue Cheese Olives! (Have at least 2)  There is usually a wait of some sort, but they have an awesome patio for those nice Arizona nights.   I have never been let down by Hillstone and that is why it will always be our place at the Biltmore.

I am a huge fan of Apple products and the Apple store service is what you expect from the #1 company in computing and electronics. I had to schedule an appointment for my 7 year old Macbook (Yeah, I am as amazed as anyone for the Macbook lasting me 7 years, I use it everyday for work and home) it's hard drive finally gave out. Right on schedule I was assigned Elizabeth to help me with my problem. She was very helpful and took the time to explain to me the cheapest and best way to fix the problem. After spending a good amount of time trying to solve the problem for free she found out it was my hard drive. I am going to be buying a new Mac soon and of course I will go back to the Apple Biltmore. Thanks again for saving me a few bucks and saving all my software and files.

Royal Palms is easily in my top 3 resorts in Phoenix. This quaint resort is nestled into camelback mtn and feels like you are miles away from the hustle and bustle of PHX. Whether you are going for a cocktail on one of their many patios, or your staying overnight you will not be let down. The bar and T. Cooks have been renovated to provide more space and maintains the perfect ambiance. The rooms at the Royal Palms are a great extension of the overall resort. Beautiful warm rooms that will give you the comfort of home, but the luxury of a 5 star resort. Go for drinks or for the night, you won't be disappointed!

I have to say this place is hands down my favorite place for getting my gal flowers!! I just call these ladies of floral decor, and within minutes they take a visionless description of what I want and create something that blows my girl away every time. Love how the can integrate artichoke or cactus into an amazing floral arrangement. This is the go to place for those looking for more than just the ordinary floral arrangement. Thanks Camelback Flowershop for making me a superstar!

We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts, delicious homemade English muffins (can't go wrong with the commuter sandwich w/ avocado and bacon). They sell a great bottle of inexpensive wine- Klee. And always revolving retail area w/ unique gifts. Great place to eat, shop & relax.

Food is super tasty! Can't go wrong with the turkey panini with pesto or bruschetta with prosciutto, figs & Mascarpone cheese. Mouth watering just thinking about it. Sundays during 11-3 they offer cool laid back tunes by Walt Richardson and $5 refreshing white sangria. A great way to relax at the end of the weekend.

I definitely got the Chicago feeling at CHC. You will see tons of Chicago memorabilia on the walls. White Sox and Cubs together?   We had the Sliders and Chili Dog. Both were good, but not quite Chicago standards. Chicago dog needs to be on the menu! That is a must for any hot dog place. The fries were really good as well.   We will go back again and try to get them to make us that true south side chicago dog. Great little place at a reasonable price.

The only reason I go to Bashas is for the convenience. First of all make sure you have some extra time to run an errand there since you will be waiting in the checkout line. The checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself. Oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products. I bought some crackers for work and they were 6 months past the expiration date. Don't forget your Bashas card if you have one, they won't give you a courtesy swipe. 1 star because i can't give 0.

Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing and one thing only. My diet coke first thing in the morning. I don't know why McDonald's diet cokes are so good, but they are the best fountain cokes around.  This location is nice in the early mornings to get in and out. Be careful later in the day as the drive thru gets very congested due to the location.

I have been frequenting gas stations for many years now and I have seen my fair share of dumps. I can't vouch for the quality of gas other than my car hasn't had fuel filter issues, but I can say the service there sucks. Their cc swipe on the pumps weren't working and I had to go in, to which I found two clerks chewing gum and leaning on the back wall behind the counter. I had to ask for them to ring me up. You would have thought that I asked them to change my tire. I know working at a gas station probably isn't their dream job, but it is their job at least for a little bit.

Alright, I am reviewing an airport. I have been thru a ton of airports in my life and I would have to say that Phoenix is one of the easier and friendlier airports. I guess if you grade on a curve Phoenix would be one of the top airports around. That being said it's not a very busy airport so that helps them a ton.

Can't believe I am giving 5 stars to a place no one ever wants to go to. The Audi Service Department is like the dentist, you know you need to go, but you worry about what they'll find. Al is by far the best Service Rep I have ever worked with. Always accommodating and no bullshit games. I know this Audi has been more challenging than my past Audi's, but with that said Al and the Audi service team have been straight forward and have taken care of all of my issues with complete ease.

I was surprised at the ratings Land Rover North got on Yelp. My experience was completely different. i was able to set up my oil change a day in advance and when I got there they started right away on my vehicle. I waited during the oil change and the girls at the service counter were very attentive and made sure I knew where the water was as well as the password to get online. Great experience for me.

Second time here. Very disappointed. It's one thing to own a land rover and frequent the service department regularly, but when the service manager is unhelpful and totally vacant you really question your choice in service centers. This will be my 3rd time here and they still can't find me in their system. Oh wait $5,000 in service needed. I'm in their system now.

This is why you find bands before they become big enough to fill Comerica! Went to see Arctic Monkeys (wtf, I didn't realize I listen to teenage music) and holy shit does this venue suck in comparison to so many other places I have been. Shitty sound, shitty space in between and in front of you and shitty layout. I should have opted for the pit and moshed it up with the kiddos. Wait, that didn't sound right. Anyways, avoid Comerica, try Marquee, Mesa Arts Center or Crescent Ballroom. I should have seen AM when they were here last time at the Marquee. Manchester Orchestra next at the Mesa Arts Center!

Wow, have my tastebuds and service needs changed! I remember coming here a few years back and I thought this place had a much better burger. Okay, the burger wasn't that good, very dry and really flavorless. Maybe that's why they have the fixing bar to add something to this burger. The service was as exciting as our burgers and made numerous mistakes and really didn't care that they did. I don't want to waste much time on this review, but I will say one positive thing. This place is very affordable and would probably be a good place to bring the kids. My review reflects my feelings of this burger joint. Blahhhhh

Mesa (Ugh) Arts (semi Ugh) Center (Yeah it's in the center of mini downtown) - I can't tell you how surprised I was with this venue. Super cool place for those concerts that don't get you up and moving. Saw Manchester Orchestra here and this venue couldn't have been better for it. Marquee and Crescent Ballroom would have sucked for this event. Now the MAC is about 10 years old, but you would think they just built this place. Really nice seating and beautiful layout. Acoustics were good for the performance, but I couldn't tell how good it would be for a louder band. Only downside I see with this place is only having one beer location. Granted it has multiple registers, but the line can build up a bit.  I am a new fan of the Mini MAC and will follow this venue for upcoming concerts and events. Now I just need to be uplifted from the sad music of MO! JK MO, concert was awesome.

I have figured out now after a few visits to Malee's that I am a level 4 heat guy! Malee's can customize heat to any dish on a scale of 1 to 5. Based on my experience it took a few times to find the right heat for me. First visit Level 2 (Jalapeno Fried Rice) yum, come on, give me a little burn on the tongue. Second visit Level 5 (Jalapeno Fried Rice) holy shit, fill the bathtub with ice, sweat dripping down the face as well as going in and out of consciousness lvl 5 is beyond a kick to the face. Third visit, a little scared, went down to Level 3, (Jalapeno Rice, Chicken Curry) yum, a little burn, but not enough for this Irish lad. The great thing about this place is that you will find the food loaded with flavor and going there multiple times to find your heat level is a great excuse to get back here. The Chicken Curry sauce is beyond delicious. One of those sauces that you could eat as a soup! Jalapeno Rice (House Specialty) is my go to as you can see. Loaded with spicy sausage, Thai basil, egg and peppers,  this fried rice is by far the best I have ever had. A great meal in itself. Little FYI get the Fried Tofu app. Amazing with the special peanut sauce.

Where the hell have you been since I've lived here?!? I have stumbled all over Old Town and never saw you! I usually am able to sniff out dive bars (not fun by the way) and this one eluded me until they turned on their Christmas lights! How the hell could I miss that? Okay, I love dive bars, they are my go to for cocktails and friends. I love Christmas lights, and not just a strand here or there, but in your face, over the top Griswald kind of shit! The Coach House takes dive and Christmas lights to great new levels. I didn't get the normal dive bar smell here, could be the majority of the bar is outside. There are two bars, one outside and one inside (small inside). This is a no bullshit, get in line and order normal drinks. No fancy mixologist shit here! Kinda refreshing actually. We mainly found ourselves outside enjoying the live music, there is a nice long table you can stand at or tables further from the bar. Coach House, thanks for sharing your Christmas spirits! As I stumbled out of the Coach House I did have enough of my wits to bookmark your location in case the Christmas lights are off.

BLT, Rita's, R Bar, Seed, Spa, Hoppin Jacks, the views, rooms and pools, this place has it all. My favorite highlights of Camelback Inn:  1. BLT - Steaks and Martinis with Blue Cheese Olives. This is my favorite steak house in the valley and those martinis go down like clear crisp glacial water. Oh yeah you got a mini appetizer with those olives too!!! 2. Spa - Been here a few times for a spa day and I would have to say this spa is one of the best in the valley. The facility is super clean, spacious and up to date. Always a great massage! The spa has it's own pool and restaurant so plan to spend the whole day here.  3. R Bar - Yeah, I'm on to Moscow Mules now and there isn't a better patio to enjoy AZ's weather under the stars.   Camelback Inn may be a little pricier than some of the other resorts in town, but if you time it right (summer) or have a little extra cash in your pockets spend a weekend here and "TREAT YOURSELF"!

Get beyond the occasional pretentious d-bags and you will see one of the more beautiful resorts in the valley. Tucked on the north side of Camelback Mtn (or hill, in my eyes) the Sanctuary has one of the more beautiful views in all of PHX. The spa has a clean contemporary feel and is a great way to set the tone for your visit here. Head out to the infinity pool which has amazing views of Camelback and the Phoenix Hills. I haven't eaten at Elements (Chef MacMillan), but I have heard nothing but rave reviews for the food and obviously views. Now, the Jade Bar, this is one of my fav watering holes when I have out of towners in. Perfect way to show your guests all of what PHX has to offer, beautiful scenic views and endless flowing cocktails! The prices seem reasonable for a high end resort and if you can serve my Moscow Mule in a copper mug I will pay a little extra. If you visiting Phoenix, take a little time out and make your way to the Sanctuary, just make sure you bring your camera!

I have to laugh at myself as I write a review on the Franciscan Renewal Center right after I did my Talking Stick review! Yep, this is were I go to pray for my sins the night before. The FRC has always been welcoming to us sinners and thankfully I am able to enter without bursting into flames. Fr. Peter is a very engaging and thoughtful man who is easily approachable. Just one of the many brothers who oversee the center. Now if you have dogs who are sinners too (they say dogs are just like their owners) FRC has a blessing of the animals every October. The Friars will bless your pet and is a wonderful place to bring your dog or animal for the afternoon. This is a great event which will never be missed!!! Thanks God and for all my blessings!!

Purista sandwich! Coming off of a big night of booze and gambling it seemed like the right call. Prosciutto, Fresh Mozzarella, Fresh Basil, Tomato, Roasted Peppers, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, & Balsamic Vinegar. Come on! What's not to like about that ass kickin sandwich! The Crispy Baguette is the perfect vessel for all of these fresh and imported ingredients. We were lucky to get in and wait just a short period of time for our order. Great, no bullshit, straight forward sandwich and deli. Tony Soprano would be very proud of this Gastronomia! Will be back again, so many more things to try.

Who doesn't like a good laugh? Always a great time at the Improv. Now we only go when we know the headliner, so we really can't rate the amateur nights. Anyways had a great night here a couple weeks ago. We decided to take my parents who are comedy fanatics like myself and we had an amazing time.   First of all it was so easy ordering our tickets online! BTW, since we go there frequently we got an email giving us the tickets for free. Always a nice bonus!  Make sure you arrive early so you can get a seat up close. Always fun when you have comedians who like to involve the crowd. We got there early enough to be close, but just outside the comedians reach.   We usually don't get food, but we ordered some and were pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Another huge bonus for this place since most comedy clubs we have gone too the food is usually sub par pub grub.  All three of the comedians were awesome! The Emcee was very weak, but the comedians did a great job getting people back to that happy place. I have the Improv bookmarked on my phone and computer to keep an eye on the calender of events. We will be back soon and often. Thanks Improv for providing a little laughter in the hot Arizona summers.

Great place in Phoenix for a good deli sandwich. Bread is hearty and the selection of sandwiches offers delicious dressings and fixings. Sandwiches are large and can be split when the hunger isn't as strong. I haven't tried the soup bowls, but my gal swears by them.   Southwest Club is my fav! Give it a try.

Great place to get your drink on! This bar has that dark musty smell that goes perfect with a beer. Didn't try any food, not that I wouldn't trust it, just didn't have space in the belly with all that beer. I will definitely go back next time I am thirsty in Tempe.

It's no wonder why people drive to Vegas from Phoenix. From having to get to your airport an hour before your flight to waiting for your bags at McCarran it is just as fast to drive. I have flown into McCarran about 100 times and whenever I can I don't check in my bags. They have a very slow baggage claim and it is total chaos to get your bag. Must be all the people trying to get to the tables as fast as they can.

Now I'm not adverse to going to museums, but this is the kinda museum that I get. Mafia, gambling, scandals, sex what's not to like about that kind of museum?! Okay, sex may not have been a part of the tour it just sounded right. This museum isn't a buy an entry and wander around museum. It's an hour long guided tour and you may have to wait for the next group so I would advise buying tickets in advance if you can. Our tour guide was very personable and they obviously train them well on Vegas history. The museum has a great collection of hotel, casino and commercial neon signs (art). My girlfriend and I went during the day which was great to see all the signs in great detail, but we will have to come back at night to see the limited signs that still work. If you're looking for a little time away from the tables or slot machines check out the Neon Museum and maybe learn a little about Las Vegas.

de LUX! I come here for one thing and one thing only, Lattes! Alright, fine, I come here for their baked goods as well. An eclectic crowd assembles here drinking their coffee and conversing, or deep in their computers. Lux is a very cool coffee house that you can relax for an hour or so or grab a joe and go. Definitely one of the top 5 coffee houses in PHX!!

What a cool little coffee joint! Now, I was a little hesitant to go in here with all the bicycle guys wearing tights like they're riding in the Tour de France. It was like one of those Harley bars (In that they were a group of guys hanging out with 2 wheeled vehicles), but these guys pack themselves into tight marketing gear. Once I got beyond the Lance Armstrong wannabees you enter a cool atmosphere with acoustic guitar, local art, and the aromas of fresh roasted coffee beans and baked goods. Staff was point on and very attentive. Added to my list of top coffee shops in greater Phoenix!

Delux is the perfect place if you are looking for a good classic burger and a cart full of fries (I like the sweet potato). The ambience isn't my favorite, the tables are jammed packed inside. It's worth eating 4 inches from your neighbor at this place though!   The burger: Great seasoned beef patty with fresh vegetables sandwiched between the perfect bun! I am a big fan of the med rare. There is so much flavor in this burger.  Cart of Fries: I like to do the combo, reg and sweet potato, with the aioli sauce. Yum!!   This would be in my top 3 places to go for a burger and fries. I would advise getting the turkey burger at Keegans. Delux's seems a little dry.

I have always seen the sign for the SW steakhouse, but never tried it until my last trip to Vegas. Now I would have to say at first that the ambiance of the steakhouse is not my favorite. I like the darker more intimate steakhouses. The SW had more of a sterile wide open feel to it. The SW does have a nice wall of windows overlooking the Wynn Waterfall.   The service is second to none. I would have to say that you will never have to get your waiters attention. They are always there to take care of any of your requests. I ended up splitting a steak with my Dad and they had no problem and didn't charge extra. Steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. Sides are a little less exciting than other Steakhouses I have been to, but were nice.   The price is a little higher than I would like to pay for the food and atmosphere, but the service lived up to the $. I think the Society restaurant offers just as good of food at a better price and more intimate setting.

Hands down the best pizza in AZ! Favorite place to take out of town guests. Make sure you order the Burrata. Best appetizer that will be inhaled. Perfect blend of fresh homemade mozzarella, prosciutto, balsamic vinegar and toasted bread. The pizza is second to none. There can be a little wait, but just grab a glass of wine and relax on the patio.

Yeah, this is as good as it gets unless you are in Europe! We were here for a Yelp Event and was so lucky to be walking by when we saw their unbelievable desserts. We had no intentions of eating, we just finished huge burgers at Holsteins in the Cosmo, but we couldn't resist. I ordered the Cinnamon Bun and my girlfriend got the chocolate croissant.   Wow. We tried a little of each others and before we even bit into it your mouth will water. I am a huge fan of cinnamon buns and this was by far the best I have ever had. The cinnamon was plentiful and the frosting was obviously a cream cheese frosting. The dough was very light and airy, like a croissant and melted in your mouth.   The Jean Philippe Patisserie will be a must every trip to Vegas!! Mouth is starting to water again just thinking about it. Wonder if they deliver

There are those certain places where my Martini is a little colder, the olives are a little tastier and the vodka goes down like water. The Country Club at Wynn is one of those places. I can sit on that patio and match the foursomes coming in with Martinis going down. Life doesn't get much better than this! Well I guess I could be the one coming up 18 playing golf and drinking martinis, but today I will be more than happy sitting on one of the more beautiful patios in Vegas. I have eaten here a couple times and the food matches every bit of that glacial martini. I can only imagine the amount that Mr. Wynn pays his staff here. This will be some of the best service you'll get. I'll let it be known that on a day I was to leave we decided to have a quick martini here before the flight. Well, after a few martini's, The Country Club changed my trip into a 3 night stay. So with that said, be careful, you will get caught up in the moment here at the Country Club!

To start off, this review should have been given months ago since we tend to go here a couple times a month. Chelsea's is our favorite place to ride our beach cruisers down the canal so we can partake in some cocktails and great American comfort food.   Favorite Dish: It has to be the Prime Rib French Dip. With very generous potions of beef and a homemade baguette you would think that would be enough. They take it a step farther with an amazing homemade horseradish sauce and perfect au jus. Wait there is also the Fish Tacos. The fish is so fresh and flaky and the brown's sauce with fresh vegetables make this a meal that has to be tops. I then remember the Chicken Nachitos, Pan Fried Chicken, Soups and so much more. There are so many favorite dishes it's very hard to choose one. You can't go wrong.  Service: Chelsea's has had a lot of the same servers for the last two years we have been going there. That tells me two things, one the establishment takes good care of there employees and they are happy. The other is that Chelsea's has done an amazing job in finding good, knowledgeable and friendly staff. Amazing how service can make a meal taste so much better.  Dessert: Yes have the Red Velvet Cake. You will gladly run the extra 5 miles tomorrow.   So after a great meal and some drinks we make our way home via the canal in hope that the ride will burn a few of the many calories we indulged in. We are so fortunate to be able to have a pit stop midway at the Biltmore Resort. Review coming soon!

What's not to like about an old musky house that has been turned into a dark dive bar with odd jukebox tunes?!? This place has that awesome, yet funky smell, that you usually have maybe deep in an attic or possibly the basement right behind the old paint and college bong. I am a huge fan of Shady's! Love being able to go to a no bullshit bar where who you are, or what your wearing, is the least important thing. This is the kinda bar you go to with your close friends and enjoy good conversation and even better jukebox tunes. The Moscow mule is one of my faves here and the bartenders provide great service and know how to make a drink! Parking sucks ass, but there is parking on the street in the neighborhood.

I have seen my fair share of stadiums in my life and the newer ones don't always get it right, but UOP Stadium is one of the better domes I have been too. The only downside I saw was the longer than normal lines to get in. Might have been the side I went in on, but either way a ton of people funneling into 2 lanes was kinda stupid. Once in you see why this will be a super bowl location for years to come. The field is top notch with the natural grass and there really isn't a bad seat in the house. Tons of beer stations and in return tons of restrooms, decent food selections are a huge plus. I didn't get to see the top open on my two visits here, but hopefully the Broncos go to the SB so I can see it then. Go Broncos!!!!

The Biltmore Macy's is a great location for anyone who needs to get something quick and get out. No worries of parking lots 2 miles away or busy hallways to fight thru.   It's selection is not as great as the Scottsdale Macy's and it is a little more cluttered and outdated. Overall, still the first place I would run to for housewares, furniture or clothes.

Now, we don't do our grocery shopping here because that is quite the expensive tab, but it is a wonderful place for unique items, easy dinners and super refreshing iced green tea.  This store has EVERYTHING you would need from a cooking utensil to a quick gift.  AJ's isn't huge but it has so much to offer.  We especially love the fresh salad bar that we frequent often.  It's just the right amount of offerings which includes fresh fruits and not the melons (which I despise) like most salad bars. It has ready made hot meals, a wonderful desserts selection and as mentioned before super delicious iced green tea.  AJ's seems to feature a multitude of local businesses which we really love.  I would give this AJ's a 5 star rating however the staff can be a little edgy sometimes and the prices are a bit higher than I would like.  Overall, a super great grocery that I always have fun going through all the goodies they offer.

Went here for a fantasy draft the other night and was dissapointed. I have gone to Half Moon a bunch of times now and I have to say the service trys their best and the food is typical pub grub. Tonight I was really surprised to see that my drinks were very watered down.  I expect that on a busy night the service may be a tad off. And I don't expect a 5 star meal at a sportsbar. The 2 stars are for the one thing that Half Moon should never have a problem with, making a drink. I like Half Moon because they are close by, but I may have to make the extra trip to Zipps this football season.

Always a great change from the typical sandwich. Thing is, there are so many other things that I could eat here. Went with my girlfriend who had the Mahi Mahi. Looked like a meal you would get at a high end restaurant. My fav: the Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus. So good! I could eat tubs of this stuff. Oh wait, I did!  Always leave this place stuffed, but never have that "I can't believe I just ate that" feeling. Okay, I will confess I had a Bosa Donut on the way home. Hey, It's 113 out what else do you do in Phoenix.

What happened to this place! This used to be a great club to gamble and party. I don't know if this is a sign of what is going on at the Palms, but this place was as dead as the hotel itself. Good to hear that this place will be opening elsewhere. The new owners of the Palms are trying to squeeze profit rather than build the casino back to where it was. Place is only getting worse.

I guess when you live in Phoenix and have so many incredible choices for Mexican food you can be a little disappointed every now and then. Cafe Rio at the start was not clear with their menu. Not sure if that is on purpose or just an oversight, but you need to have a starting point for customers. I ordered a chicken burrito and was shocked at the lack of help and suggestions. I didn't know what they had for additions nor was I told.   Maybe I caught them on an off day, but I think they could do some adjusting to their menu and process.

Spending many years in San Diego, I would say this is the closest to the top taco/burrito shops in SD. Tortilla's are the best in AZ, no reason they have been voted that years in and out. Grab a bag of tortillas for later.  FYI, try the Green Corn Tamales, not on their menu, but a hidden masterpiece at Carolina's.

I am about 134 turkey sandwiches too late on this review. I have literally eaten about 100 turkey sandwiches from this place over the last few years and I am just now giving them a big hell yeah! Bertha's is my go to sandwich place! I have tried most of the sandwiches here and let me save you some time and tell you "GET THE TURKEY SANDWICH"! Herb roasted turkey, caramelized onion, bacon (duh), pesto mayo, assorted lettuce stuff, tomato and fresh made bread. Sold! Wrap it up with one of those damn chocolate cookies and let's call it lunch. You know they say, way to a man's heart is thru his stomach! Bertha, whatcha doin this Friday?

Truly one of the more beautiful areas of Phoenix. Gorgeous homes and tree lined streets, this casual stroll around the Biltmore makes you feel like you are somewhere outside of Phoenix. Always a great bike ride or walk to Hava Java thru the Loop.   P.S. watch for errant golf balls. There are some bad golfers out on that course.

What? I was so shocked by my experience here!! I feel like I was told that I won a new Audi R8 and went down to the dealership and was given a 1986 Club Car Golf Cart. Have my tastebuds died from all of my martini nights? Don't I know Mexican food? My foodie confidence has taken a massive hit. Do I start at Taco Bell and work my way back to the Big Leagues? Damn you Los Reyes!! I thought I should write down how I felt about my torta to start my process back.   Dear Carne Asada, you were treated with such disrespect and were left without flavor and Mexican flare! I was so looking forward to meeting you and seeing why so many loved you. Carne Asada, you're like all those girls in SoCal with the fake boobs and lips. Such a disappointment to find out! The one saving grace you have is your roll, but that roll only hides what you lack inside. Empty and souless!   Where do I go now? Where are the real Carne Asada's out there? Do I need to go south of the border? I know my perfect Carne Asada Torta is out there. Juicy, flavorful and every bit tasty! I'm going to keep looking, but I won't be fooled by Los Reyes again.

This is a must for anyone in the valley during the holidays. This is my second year attending and once again I felt the Christmas Holiday as soon as I stepped into the gardens. Never feel like I have enough time hustling from band to band.   DBG did another amazing job with a great selection of music, service and of course the beauty of the luminarias thru out the gardens. We had the set meal again this time and it was well worth the additional cost.   Whether you want to relax by the fire listening to Spanish guitar, or get energized by the Travelers band the DBG Luminarias is one of the most memorable yearly events in Phoenix.  This event is great for families, couples or friends.

Glad I still have a little piece of San Diego here in Phoenix. One of my favorite places to grab a animal style burger and well fries.   Love the simplicity of the menu and the spread is better than anything else you can put on a burger. The spread is great with fries too!

I will not be visiting La Piccola again. I hate writing this review and I really felt like not writing one at all. I feel like I really need to let this business know where they are falling short. I do want to give a very positive review of our waitress. She was in training, but she was attentive and was our only enjoyment of the night.   The two glaring problems with La Piccola:  The food: did not taste fresh at all. It was something we all picked up on. My cous cous was overcooked and very bland. My chicken was seasoned well, but not cooked all the way and my asparagus was damn near raw. Let's just say I didn't finish my meal. I am only going to review my meal, but the others in our party were all disappointed.   The owner Andy: is definitely not a good front of house. He really should manage in the back. We were treated poorly by the owner, who has a rude and had an arrogant way about him. I didn't touch my cous cous and Andy thought it was because my palate wasn't sophisticated enough. He didn't even think that maybe there was something wrong with it. I think Andy believes his restaurant is earth shattering here in the valley, but in reality it is just another unmemorable place under the sun.

Okay, our furniture hunt has taken us to the Macy's at Scottsdale Fashion Mall. We have been trudging thru isles of leather, wood and microfiber looking for the perfect sectional. This elusive piece has been just out of reach until we found it at Macy's Scottsdale. It was in sight, just a few paces behind a couple of Italian Recliners. Our guide Randy helped us pass on a couple of sofas that didn't make the cut. Finally, we had our sofa! Wait, Randy who was the perfect guide tells us we had to wait 3 months till this prize kill would be ours. Backordered!   All fun aside, Randy was a great sales person and we probably will wait the 3 months on this find. If you are looking for great furniture at very competitive prices give Macy's a try. With all the stores we visited I would say Macy's had the better selection and prices that worked for us.

Encore is a great addition to the Wynn. I actually liked the casino, it seemed to be a little more quiet than the Wynn. The room was very nice, love the ceiling to floor windows and the seating area. Steve Wynn is always spot on with his attention to detail. I only give it 4 stars because the wait service was very sparse. Took way too long to get drinks at the poker machines.

I am a huge Fleming's fan and I found myself a little let down at the West Gate Fleming's. The service is always perfect here. We had a larger group and I think they did an amazing job making sure we were all happy.   The Food: We started with oysters as our appetizer and they weren't too far off from the best I have ever had. Ice cold and flavorful! Shoot away. I usually pass on salad or soup. I get salads elsewhere. This is my carnivorous place. I ordered the filet mignon med rare and it was cooked to perfection. I prefer a nicely peppered, salted steak cooked to perfection. I am not the soaking in butter steak guy. Go to Ruth Chris for that. We ordered the Fleming's potatoes and asparagus as our sides. The potatoes are a legendary staple and the asparagus is always slender and delicious.   The Drink: Here is my one downfall. Almost as important as the steak are my Martinis. Usually you will get the best martinis at steak houses. They shake them a little longer and the bartender usually knows how to properly use vermouth. Well, my first martini was more like a half of a martini. It was also slightly chilled. My second was a full martini, but was so over vermouthed that I almost gagged. Slightly chilled as well. When you pay more for a steakhouse martini, you kind of expect more.   I will always make Fleming's one of my steakhouse go to's. May just have to give a little more direction on the martinis.

I wish you guys were more centrally located!! I play quite a bit of tennis and need my strings done usually every other month. All about tennis has great same day service and always done professionally. I would say the cost seems a little higher than most places I have gone, but I am willing to pay a little more for good work. Huge selection of clothes, shoes and obviously rackets. The staff here are very knowledgeable with the sport and the equipment, always given good recommendations and advice. Open up a store closer to the Biltmore!!

5 Reasons this is my go to Steakhouse in PHX!   1. Kettle One Martini's with hand stuffed blue cheese olives. Yeah, not rocket science here, but these are bowls of life sustaining liquid and food!!! Generous size martini's poured to glacial perfection.   2. Filet Mignon. Ruth Chris step aside with your butter steaks and let a true steakhouse show you how to cook a filet mignon. Grilled with a beautiful char and seasoned gently with butter and rosemary, this steak (Medium Rare) melts in your mouth. Wash is down with some Kettle One and start the process all over.   3. Popovers. Americans make everything better. BLT took an English side (Yorkshire Pudding) and amped it up with Popovers. Very intimidating at first, but grab it, rip it, butter it and enjoy!! Wash it down with some Kettle One and start the process all over.   4. Kettle One Martini's with hand stuffed blue cheese olives. Yeah, finished the first and on to the second one!  5. Camelback Inn. This restaurant is a must for your out of town guests. The beauty of Camelback Inn with the view of the mountain sets a scene that just can't be replicated anywhere else. Wash it done with some Kettle One and relax!  Time to save up for my next trip to BLT!!!

Found this place through Yelp and a Yelping buddy so there you have it...the power of Yelp because we absolutely LOVED this place.  Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.   Great place we will frequent often.    P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased).

Alright, I confess, I go to a spa for my haircuts!! I am not a salon kind of a guy, but when I find someone who can cut my hair and make me look human, I stick with that person thru thick and thin!! I have been to Joya Spa before for a massage and it was phenomenal, but this review is about the hair side of things. I was referred to this stylist from my girlfriend and I hesitantly went expecting frosted tips and a 3 digit bill. What I found was Rina, the stylist, and she kicks ass!! This girl knows her shit, and talks fantasy football! What's better than that? A f*ing shampoo after the haircut!!! Hell yeah, I'm all in! What the hell have I been doing going to barber shops where the guy who cuts my hair gives me his style cut from the 50's!?! Now the place is in the Montelucia Resort so you need to park in the lot below, but just up from the steps is the salon. Easy to make appointments and the staff is always on their game. No more Beatle's haircuts for me! Thanks Rina!!!

One of our favorite resorts to visit. The beautiful front courtyard and bar are a great place to bring family and friends. Brought my parents there for a couple drinks after the Improv and we were thrilled to have some live entertainment that went with the casual feel of the bar. The great thing about the Montelucia is you can be in business attire or casual resort attire and you will fit in fine. Had a great blues band that had people up dancing and had my mom dancing in her seat. She is a huge seat dancer! This place is up there with the Royal Palms and the Sanctuary. Great resorts that offer beautiful scenery for locals and tourists.

Brought here by our other Yelping buddies a few months ago and we've become regulars.  Some must haves are the chorizo eggs benedict, Belgium waffles & hangover sandwich.  Let me break this down by each meal because just mentioning them isn't enough.   Chorizo eggs benedict - the chorizo is from a local butcher and probably the best chorizo I've tasted aside from homemade by family and the hollandaise sauce is light and perfectly made, not strong tasting at all.  This meal is paired with the best breakfast potatoes seasoned to perfection. The Belgium waffles and full, fluffy and sweet.  Almost like eating a cake like donut.  Mmmm mmmm! Hangover sandwich is basically like putting the all American breakfast between two pieces of toast.  BAM! Basically a groovy place with rad food.  Be warned you may have a wait and if you have a pup you can sit on the patio with your doggy.  Our pals bring their dogs pretty frequently. Check it out!

This place is a regular pit stop from the tables. Always something delicious whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner. True to Steve Wynn standards the service and food is expectedly consistent.   Society has a nice little finish to your meal. Swedish Fish as you leave. Hell YaZ!!!

Stayed at the Encore for a tradeshow and this place was a great bar to unwind and have some perfect martinis and tapas. Beautiful decor (Wynn specialty) invites you in and the drinks and food will keep you there. Get a good table and enjoy the company you are with. This is one of those places where the time will fly by as you find yourself putting down too many cocktails. Good news the elevators to your room are right near by!

Wow, is it difficult to find a good cleaners. I moved to Phoenix about 2 years ago and have gone thru about a half a dozen cleaners. Camelback Cleaners is not going to get you on the looks inside, but they do a great job and at a awesome price. Never lost an item or had an item ruined. That is all I can ask for!

We went to Macy's furniture department to find some furniture for our new place. We were very happy with not only the selection, but the service was great. Most definitely our best sofa hunting experience of the day. The sales person was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable of the product they offered.   We think we found the sofa we wanted, but our sales person told us that there will be an upcoming sale in Sept where we can save additional $. Now that is good ethical service. Thanks Macy's! We will be back in a couple weeks.

Scramble is my new go to for PHX breakfast. I seem to obsess over my breakfast places and my new one is Scramble. Being a Irish white guy with latin tastebuds Scramble was the perfect place for me. If you crave breakfast burritos and you're not in San Diego I would recommend Scramble.   Multiple options for bb's ranging from chorizo with jalapeno sour cream to your basic gringo bacon and egg bb. I also love how they will happily adjust your order to your liking. If you want egg whites or crispy potatoes they will accommodate all of your requests.   Seating doesn't seem to be a problem even on a Sunday morning. 12:00pm is still morning for me on Sunday btw.

Finally doing a review of my home away from home (At least when it's cooler than 95 degrees)! I'm not a hike with the rest of Phoenix kinda guy, so you won't find me on Camelback Mtn or South Mtn. Phoenix Mountain Preserve has trails that snake all over the place. Mix up the trails for longer runs or steeper treks. I am addicted to this crazy wild area of Phoenix. I love the fact that I can run right from my house and be in the thick of dust, cactus and reptiles in just a couple minutes. Now I would suggest pulling up some trail guides to figure out what loop would be best for you. Just know that not all the trails appear on these guides. Use the Mountains (or as I call them hills) as your guide. I learned my favorite trails just by trial and error. Word of caution, when you are going with the trial and error, know that when you are on the less traveled trails you will hear or run into some rattlers. My suggestion, and I wouldn't go by it, is to turn your music up loud enough so you don't hear them. The busiest trail is the one off of 32nd st. and Lincoln. Most people just go to the top of the peak and then turn around. Be adventurous and try the loop back to the 202! Well worth the 5 mile trek/run!! I didn't think I would like Phoenix when I moved from San Diego about 5 years ago, but I have to say my love of the Ocean has been able to transform into my love of the desert. Get your ass out there on these trails, you'll love it! If you get bit by a rattler sorry for the bad advice!  **Oh shit, forgot about the Tarantula Hawk! I had one land on me and I damn near fell off the trail. There is one thing that freaks me out here, these damn things are the size of a hummingbird and have the most painful sting in the world. No BS!! Thanks for the reminder Joyce!! Enjoy the trail!!

Love the Wright Bar, mainly because it's in walking distance. This isn't the cheapest bar in town. Expect to pay @ $19 for a Martini. The extra costs for drinks are palatable with the ambiance of the Historic Hotel. Nice dark decor and beautiful floor to ceiling windows this bar is the sort of place where you relax and take in the beauty of Squaw Peak and all the tourists going by. Well, after $60 in drinks its time to put some food in the stomach. It's an easy 40 yard walk to Frank & Albert's. Love having this amazing Phoenix Landmark in our backyard. Cheers!

First off, who the hell wrote my initial review? 4 stars too? That's what you get when I'm reviewing sober!! Blah, boring and no cursing. I probably did this back when my Mom was reading my reviews. Anyways, this place kicks ass and not in the saying kind of way, but there is a chance you can get kicked in the ass here. Yeah, you're going to get the beautiful Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, that is just a given. And yes it is the perfect setting to throw down a martini or six. What I love most about this bar are the bartenders, well the martini's then the bartenders. I guess the martinis are made by the bartenders so them first? Chicken and the egg thing I guess. Autumn and Aaron have been bartending at the Wright Bar for years now and they don't get much better than these two. When you're able to text your bartender the next day to find out whether you paid or how many martinis you had, you know you're in good hands. The Wright Bar has a great set-up where you can sit inside when it's cold or you can sit inside when it's hot as hell! Okay, it does have an amazing patio, but I feel like it's too far away from the vodka. The Wright Bar is my go to when I'm feeling like a nice martini and light conversation. Sit back, relax and enjoy the beauty of the Biltmore, it doesn't get much better than this!   P.S. Be careful with your Aura here, you may be called out if it's too big for the bar. That's a whole other story which I'll tell you if you ever at the Wright Bar!

The Arizona Biltmore has been oasis in the central valley for decades. I remember going to the Biltmore when I was younger and at that time I really didn't appreciate the architecture like I do now.   This beautiful hotel would seem cold and dark in most environments, but it works in Phoenix. If you have the opportunity stay here in the Christmas season. The lights and cooler nights are ideal for hanging out by the fire pits and taking in Squaw Peak.   Always great food whether you are at Wrights, Frank & Alberts or the cafe in the courtyard. Prices are higher, so know that going in. The Hotel offers breaks in the off-season so that may help offset that cost somewhat.

We love going to the Arizona Biltmore, whether to eat or enjoy the patio off of the Wright Bar. The Frank Lloyd Wright design still blows me away with his detail. I don't know of too many lobbies that have a more beautiful seating area.   The hotel's new Hollywood and Wine Events was a great find for us. On specified weekends the hotel hosts either comedy or musical acts in one of their rooms. We went to the Comedy show last weekend and had an amazing time. $10 for the tickets (show lasted 2 hours) and the well drinks were only $5 (includes martinis). I was paying $19 at the Wright Bar just 100 yards away. Great comics and overall show.   The Biltmore is worth just visiting or spending a few days to enjoy the spa and golf. Glad we live right there to enjoy it year round.

The Parlor, a place I would have thought was a VFW more than a restaurant. Once you enter from the rear (that doesn't sound right) you find a contemporary spot with wood, glass, concrete and subtle light coming thru from Camelback Rd. I have been here a couple times and the food is always spot on! For some reason I always seem to write my review after a few visits. Maybe I like to grade on a curve! That always worked for me when I was a kid. Hahaha. The one thing I would change about this place is the seating at the pizza oven. One, I would lower the bar a little so you can see them make the pizzas and two, I would shut the door to the dishwashing room. Kinda nasty looking at food on the floor and dirty dishes. I see enough of that at my house! With that said, the barber like chairs are very cool. Great place for a date night or with friends! Cauliflower gratin? Seriously, that shit is good!

Won't ever come back here again! I came in and was waiting in line to order a sandwich and was shocked to realize the people in front of me were actually his friends. Finally he took my order (very rudely like i totally bothered him) 2-3 minutes later and as I left he went back to talking to them instead of making my damn sandwich. No excuses for such poor service. Oh and by the way the sandwich sucked and was burned.

So after the Rock n Roll Las Vegas 1/2 Marathon I decided it was time to carb up! Wait, do you do that before you run? My beautiful girlfriend flew into town to join me and Scarpetta was the perfect place to take her for dinner seeing we were staying at the Cosmo and it wasn't too far of a walk for my trashed legs!  I had requested to be seated by the windows overlooking the Bellagio Fountains and the table couldn't have been more romantic. We requested the Sommelier and he promptly came to our table and my gal and him found the perfect wine for us. I'm more of a vodka expert. For an appetizer we ordered some oysters, not sure where they were from, but they were smaller than normal yet very flavorful. My girlfriend and I split a couple entrees, the duck and foie gras ravioli and the Colorado lamb trio. The duck and foie gras ravioli was amazing! I know it's not cool to do that to ducks, but I was bit by a duck when I was young and I'm cool with it. Not too mention it was absolutely delicious! The Colorado lamb trio was another memorable entree with what I believe was a lollipop, cutlet and steak. I must say this was a very romantic meal with excellent service and mouth watering food. Scarpetta will always have a special place in our hearts! Thanks

Found this place on Yelp and we couldn't have agreed more with the reviews. This is a tiny hole in the wall next to an asian massage "R&T". I could have driven by this place hundreds of times and never seen it. Ignore the tacky decor, because this place has some of the best carne asada in Phoenix. Start with the chips and salsa and you will see that this isn't your regular taco shop.   We tried the carne asada tacos, carne asada burrito and the chips and guacamole. All delicious. The carne asada is tender and full of flavor. Guacamole and salsas are so fresh and tasty that you will run thru your chips in no time.   We have been to Sonora Grill now a few times and I am just getting around to my review. I think that says it all. Sonora Grill is a must!

I'm a huge fan of Pho, what's better than a great big bowl of broth with some meat, veggies and noodles. I have had a hard time finding Pho in Phoenix, which btw would be a great Pho restaurant name (Pho Phoenix), anyway Yelp led my gf and I to Pho Thanh. Very authentic Vietnamese place with great  a huge selection of Pho and other Vietnamese dishes. I would recommend the tofu over the beef. Great prices and great Pho.

Yelp!! Love you guys. I have be disappointed so many times at this other Carwash I used to go to. Used to go to!!! Found hot shots from yelp and got the best wash in phoenix. Cost is a little more, but your car is hand washed and towel dried. Car hasn't sparkled this much since the day I bought it.

Great looking restaurant located inside the Biltmore resort. It's their more casual restaurant compared to Wrights.  It's a great place to have a few apps or meal after sipping on too many Martinis at the Wright Bar.  The staff is pleasant and right on top of your next drink order.  The few times we've dined here we've had delicious food but their menu does change.  The have the coolest looking bread sticks that resemble wheat stalk and is always paired with lip smacking dips that are unique and robust in flavors.  We had the pork empanadas and risotto ravioli. All was super delicious.  A great place to sit back and unwind and enjoy who you're with.

This is my go to liquor store and I have to say I rarely find another place with as good of prices as Total Wine. This place has a great selection of Vodka and Beer, which are really the only two things I give a shit about. I have in the past though needed to get some wine and there has got to be a better way to merchandise that stuff. Wine seems to be scattered thru out the store, which I'm sure is on purpose. Staff is always very helpful and if they don't have something they will give you options. Total Wine - 1 thing, can you stock XO Vodka again? Not sure I know why you got rid of it, but it's the best vodka out there for martinis! Cheers!!!

Another great suggestion found on Yelp!  Searching for something sweet in the area, Yuri's popped up.  Based on reviews we read we had to stop by and try the different flavors.  So glad we did!  The caramel is absolutely delicious! We also tried the blueberry, strawberry, cinnamon, but were sold on the caramel!  Although, all were delicious. We also got hooked on the cheddar.  The flavor that seems to be the fav and was of course out when we got there was chocolate dipped caramel popcorn! YUM!     Even more important was the service.  I wish we would have got her name, but she was so supper sweet and made sure we tried all the flavors (of course totally got us hooked by doing that, SMART).   The store itself is classic looking, very clean with old fashion favorites like taffy, beeman's gum and many more great ones to choose from.  Absolutely dug the pics on the wall she had with the diff flav's of popcorn.    One last worthy note, she does unique gift basket's with all her goodies.  She was making one for a golf tournament with a beer six pack box that had her snacks, popcorn and candy.  Very cool idea and looked great!  She does gift ideas from inexpensive to moderately priced.  She also does seasonal treats like caramel dipped apple flavors.  Signed up on her email list so we can be sure to see what yummy treats we can indulge in or give as gifts.    We'll be loyal patrons for sure!

Dylan's did a great job! Was able to make an appointment for the same day. Price was very reasonable and the place was nice and clean inside. Great location right next to Postinos and La Grande. You may want to make an appointment earlier in the morning as the parking gets a little crazy there.

Let me get the one negative thing for me out of the way. I like the old location better. Something about sitting up and being able to watch these amazing chefs create wonders is highly missed for me. With that said, now I can get on to all the kick ass stuff these guys are doing! FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD. With the Farm to Table concept in full gear here, this place is heaven for your sinning taste buds. The menu is constantly changing so you will be pleasantly surprised every time you visit.   Chef Charleen brings it from the start to the finish. Let's start with the appetizers, order one or two of them. You'll need to wake that mouth up from your day to day grub. Entrees, um pretty much pick your favorite protein and wait to have mouth and gut karate chopped by the Chef. This place put's so much flavor into their dishes that you savor every little chew. Your mouth is almost exhausted from the additional chewing you'll do here.   Check out FnB's special events as well. We did the Chinese "Pop Up" event and had an absolutely amazing meal from Chef Helen Yung from Sweet Republic. That girl can bring it when it comes to pre dessert food!  Doesn't FnB stand for "F***iNg Brilliant"?!?

This is my 5th Rock and Roll 1/2 Marathon and I would have to say my favorite. I'm more of a late afternoon runner and running at night is ideal for this late night guy. Now I flew in the day of the race since I can't control myself in Vegas and I would have to say I cut it a little close with the race. I got an extra mile of running in to get the the start in time. I'm not sure if it's normal weather for this race, but I froze my ass off waiting for the run to start. Luckily I was in Corral 6 so my wait once it started was very short. As the run goes it really is an easy 1/2 marathon with very little elevation changes. I would have thought the bands would have been a little better being in Vegas, but either way it doesn't matter with such amazing views on your run. Who doesn't want to run down Las Vegas Blvd at night? Well probably someone who just rolled a blackjack table at O'sheas (don't even know if that place is still open). Overall a great run and even better host city for a Rock and Roll.

Petique is a gem tucked at the end of the Biltmore Fashion Square. Great pet store for unique pet toys and beds that you can't find at your big box pet chains. Petique offers numerous local products which is always a plus. That is only a small part of what makes this place so amazing. The pet adoptions is what this store is all about.   I can't tell you how many times we have been at this store and a dog, cat or even rabbit is given a second chance with the help of AHS (Arizona Humane Society). Thanks again AHS for everything you do to help our furry friends. Great store that is so much more.

I have stayed at most of the nicer casinos on the strip and this is by far my favorite. As you walk into the lobby you will notice right away at the high tech nature of this casino. The 8 or so 15ft pillars play video and digital images. If you are on the right kind of drugs this would occupy a ton of your time.   When you check in once again the high tech casino is on display. LCD screens with hotel info and doubles as your check in signature. I was able to get a balcony room (yes a balcony, not many of these on the strip). The room is controlled from the lcd phone. You can control climate, lights, music etc.   The casino was very cool. Nice size, not too large and had plenty of table and machine games. The restaurants were a little spread out, but the selection was wide.   Make sure you go to see the chandelier and the bars that are draped by them. I will be staying at The Cosmopolitan from now on. My choice on the strip. Sorry Wynn.

Dark lit, copper top bar (I think, it was dark), booze flowing and amazing comfort food makes this place a nice place for Tommy to go! Yeah, third person, so 1990's! Belly up here and get special happy hour prices on drinks and food! I usually stay clear of New Mexican food, but I have been here a couple times now and the flavors are amazing. Green chili, roasted peppers, garlic, smoked meats, fish, oysters, you name it, it's all amped up here. The heat of spice here isn't bad like most New Mexican food so don't be afraid and eliminate choices. Now I know some people aren't fans of the darker atmosphere here, but let your eyes acclimate and you'll see the warm inviting dinning room. Just be sure you don't drop your keys or wallet! JK. This place also has a great outdoor dinning and bar area in between the restaurants. Nice little patio to grab drinks and visit!

Tammy saved our household!! We live in a condo that shares two walls with neighbors. The problem we had was our beagle liked to bark when we went anywhere. The problem wasn't Duffy, it was us! We found Wiggles and Wags on Yelp and for good reasons they are rated 5 stars. Duffy is a 13 year old beagle who has been an amazing companion, but has had some issues barking when we are gone. What we found out right away from Tammy was that with a couple of simple corrections with both us and Duffy we could overcome our separation anxiety. Tammy spent about an hour and a half with us then did a follow up appointment 2 weeks later. We have a happy and stress free house now. Thanks Tammy and Howard!!!!

Finally caught up with the Short Leash Dogs Truck. Thanks to Twitter I have been able to track down this hotdog heaven on wheels. We caught up with the truck at the Phoenix Market this Wednesday. This is a usual stop for Short Leash and they are joined by other food trucks. Very cool scene for a Weds. night.  We pretty much ordered the left side of the menu. We ordered the "Lady" and "Moki" both hot dogs are nestled into pita like buns (delicious). Absolutely the best hotdog I have had west of Wrigley Field. Sorry, Chicago dog will always be my fav.   We also ordered a couple of the corndogs. Love their batter. Has kind of a cornbread consistency to it. I would recommend getting one or two of these.  We also ordered the fried pickles. I have always heard about fried pickles, but I have not found a place to try them. So glad Short Leash was my first. Would much rather have fried pickles than fries.   The meal was awesome. The price was awesome. The Owners are awesome. We will be supporting this food truck regularly and will make sure we spread the word with our friends.

Had a great night at Stand Up Scottsdale.  Howard Hughes has done a great job creating a great comedy club in old town. I have been to comedy clubs all over the country and I had as much at the Stand Up as I have at the Comedy Cellar in NY!   Keep bringing in the talent and the jokes Howard. Great show tonight!

The food was great. I think what turned me off on this place is that it ends up being a club. Not that I am against clubs, but when you have food like this maybe you should be a nice restaurant and bar. The club part of this place was definitely lacking. I think the Canteen would be better off focusing on the food and bar side of the business rather than the club. Wait staff was sub par and the noise was beyond loud. Great place to go if you don't plan on talking.

Great Tapas bar in Fountain Hills! Went on a Yelp search and Sofrita was spot on with the reviews. The restaurant is small in size, but it may have seemed a little smaller with the live entertainment. BTW the spanish guitar and singer were amazing. I don't mean to knock Fountain Hills at all, but we were pleasantly surprised to have great entertainment like that there. The food was inhaled!!! Bruschetta was absolutely delicious. If you go there make sure you order it. We also had the Macaroni Cheese which was excellent and we called it. Crumbled Cheese Its on top. Yum. If you are looking for a getaway from the valley, head up to Fountain Hills and visit Sofrita. You will not be disappointed.

Decided to go to Beckett's Table because of Yelp's reviews.  It was exactly as described.  We had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits and glad we did.  They were flaky, tasty and no butter needed.  And yes, we did the macaroni and cheese as well.  Listen, if were going to Beckett's table we were going to try it all!  The mac & cheese was a unique blend but it worked.  We also had the short rib dish.  The meat just fell apart.  The yukon mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  We may have overdone it but it was well worth it.  Plenty more to try next time.  Oh, and try an Arnold Palmer...mmm mmm!  Cool ambiance too!  Beautiful presentation & great service.  A nice surprise for the location.  Great place, give it a try!

Great sandwich at a great price. I would consider this an upscale Subway. The bread is much better and you get more generous portions of meat. Always fast service, but with the amount of people they have behind the counter it isn't surprising. Wheat bread is a nice alternative if you feel like more of a traditional sandwich. I would say this is one of the better Fast Sandwich Places. I wish we had a Which Wich here!

Great flavorful burger!!!! Well worth the $18.   The waitress told me to order the Gold Standard and she was right on the money. The meat was so juicy and flavorful. Do not put ketchup on this burger!!! When they delivered my burger they gave me the great advice of not adding ketchup until I tried a bite. So glad they told me that because it was so delicious without it.  I really can't tell you much about the fries. I think I liked them, but I was so into my burger that I couldn't tell you much about them. I actually ordered a Martini to go with this steak burger and it couldn't have been more fitting.   The service was great. I decided to sit up at the bar since I was rolling solo. Eating an amazing burger, sipping on a Martini and reading Steve Jobs biography. My most mellow dinner in Vegas ever! Enjoyed every bit of it.   I will make sure next time I am in Vegas I visit and bring my friends for the best burger I have had in quite some time.

Huge fan of Royal! I have been to both the Royal bar at Union and storefront in the Biltmore. Love their lattes either hot or cold. I prefer the Union location just because of the seating outside is nicer than the other location at the Biltmore.   Either location will give you great customer service and excellent coffee creations.

CPH in Old Town is one of the tops! I've been to Citizen a couple times now and both times this place brought it.  Ambiance is clean, open, minimalist and dark setting with a romantic feel to it.  We wish I could remember our server's name but he was someone we could have been friends with!  Very funny and knowledgeable of the menu and knew the dishes inside and out.  We started with the tzatziki and hummus plate..so addicting.  We shared the signature chop salad and let us make it very clear....GET THE F*ING CHOP SALAD!  The way it's plated is all separated and mixed table side. The salad has a unique blend of marinated tomatoes, smoked salmon, pepitas, couscous and a bunch of other shit I forgot. I should have said before the food I had a martini or two so my attention to detail on the menu was a little skewed. We also shared the scallops that were cooked to perfection placed on grits and spinach.  Even the bread and olive oil were delicious.  One of my favorite places to dine in Old Town Scottsdale.  Will definitely return and highly recommend!!

I have no idea where to start with this review. I don't know if I went to dinner, a magic show, a Luminati meeting or was drugged and shoved into a room with 8 other people eating quarter sized pizzas and miniature furniture pillows.   One thing I do know is I was sitting at a bar like structure for 2 hours and only had 2 cocktails. WTF? I had to have been drugged!!   This is one of those once in a lifetime meals that will make you wonder what the fuck just happened. I really didn't know what to expect when we arrived. We checked in at his Jaleo restaurant where we were shuttled to a table to wait with 8 other anxious diners/showgoers. The staff were on it making sure we had cocktails (could have been drugged at this point) and within a short 10 to 15 minutes we were led to the secret room.   My Mom taught me back in the day not to trust situations like this, but my girl felt good about it so I was all in!! The room was just big enough to fit 8-10 diners, couple chefs and a couple wait staff. Really cool decor from a corset lamp to a wall of drawers that had a hidden door to the kitchen.   As we all sat down, I tried to figure out which diner was weakest in case shit went bad and we had to sacrifice one of us. I had a couple in mind so I was feeling a little better. The chefs entered like gladiators entering a ring for battle. Let's get ready to rumble!!  Round one of this 20 round battle started out with a bang! A cocktail! Now this is my kind of dinner.  A frozen Sangria that was like dipping dots for booze goers like me. As I was eating my sangria my mind went to that happy place, no longer thinking about sacrificing the lady from DC.   As the rounds rolled on my senses really started to get twisted. Flavors, colors, smells, ingredients and textures were all getting turned upside down. I no longer could guess flavors from the look, smell and color of the dish.   By far my favorite round was the spanish pizza! The bite size pizza packed more punch and flavor than the best 18" pizza you could get in Phoenix (Yeah Phoenix has the best pizza in the country)   This is just a part of my food trip I was on:  Potato Glass with truffle puree  Skate with truffle air (I don't even know what that means!) Flan Raspberry Rosewater sorbet on goat cheese with a mint branch meringue (Can't make that shit up) Australian Wagyu Ribeye with flourless gnocchi Beet Tartar (Loved it, duh) Spanish Tuna Belly (Like a party in your pants) and another 12 or so other courses!!!  After the 2 hours and 20 courses came to an end I fully appreciated what an amazing trip my 5 senses went thru. Jose Andres and his amazing staff of chefs really have something special going on in that little room in the back of Jaleo! I still don't know how they got my boxers off without me knowing!! JK, that happened at the Chinese restaurant behind the Orleans, my Mom was right about not trusting that situation!!

Love this place! I would totally expect this place on Campbell or in Old Town Scottsdale, but just West of the 51 on Shea this is a gem in front of a strip mall. Not knocking that part of town, just saying that this place doesn't fit in! That's a good thing. Awesome atmosphere without the pretentious Scottsdale crowd! Sorry Scottsdale. Hell I'm probably pissing everyone off with this review.   32 Shea has a great intimate feeling with a great shaded patio and smaller indoor dinning area. Had the perfect burrito coupled with the best Mocha Latte ever! This place has great service as well! Give this place a try, just look for the one place that's not like the others on the corner of 32nd St. and Shea!!

Yelpers you have led me to the promise land again!! Okay, so it may not be as beautiful and as safe an area as I thought the promised land was, but you enter that odd non lit door and bam, you've made it! Not great signage or really anything to shout we are tops for tacos in PHX, but this is not hidden for those who know delicious street tacos.   You may want to take some time and review the menu before you go if this is your first time. I ordered off the cuff and realized after ordering there were many other things worth trying. That's alright, I ordered enough food for 8 people (there was only 2 of us) all for under $20. This is what I tried:  Asada Street Tacos: 5 Stars - You will get me every time if you can have tender carne asada with onions and a ton of cilantro! Delicious  Molote: 5 Stars - Masa corn fritter filled with Chorizo! No need to say more  Shrimp Street Tacos: 5 Stars - Love the sauce!  Asada Quesadilla: 5 Stars - Fine, yeah I went back to more asada! Awesome!  I will be back, this is just the start of my list here at this taco mecca! One recommendation for these angels of the grill, Adobada!! Amen!

This is where you wished you checked Yelp before you ate there. Not only was the food just mass produced like airport food, but was tasteless. We saw numerous people who left more than 75% of there meal on the plate. The place has a very bright and inviting feel to it, but the food just didn't make you want to stay. Too pricey for the less than mediocre food. This is why you have Yelp as an easy to access app.

Butters Pancakes? Instantly, I pulled up my Cardiologist's phone number just in case! Now this was a classic bookmarked place on Yelp that I finally got around to visiting. We had a slight wait of 15 minutes, which isn't bad at all with the amount of people waiting. Things I loved:  1. Orange Juice - Very fresh and would be even better with some Kettle One 2. Food - Had the breakfast burrito w/ chorizo (checked again to make sure my doc was on speed dial) Very good with the somewhat crispy butter potato hashbrowns.  3. Service - This place would have totally gotten 5 stars if it wasn't for the odd service. One of the people we went with received his order, but there was an extra egg (he didn't even notice until she came over). She had the cojones to take his plate away well after he started eating because it was meant for another table. She didn't apologize and actually made him feel like it was his fault. He stopped her saying he had already started eating and it was too late. Very odd to say the least.  Overall, we had a good experience and will possibly try it again when we're in the area. Maybe sneak in some Kettle One! Shit, why do I always show my hand! Catholic guilt.

Another yelp suggestion that paid off. Now first off this isn't Cibo. Cibo is tops in AZ. I would say Brugo is in the top 10 in Phoenix. These are thicker crust pizzas not to be confused with Chicago style. They have numerous specialty pizzas to choose from which range from Doritos on top to your regular pepperoni. We went with house specialty Chrissy. Great flavor with the combination of red sauce and pesto. Delicious! We will definitely come back again, but that's only because Cibo has a wait and is 20 minutes further.

Great Course with amazing view of the best of what AZ offers. Loved the design of the course and will play here again for sure.   Tip: Keep it straight! Target golf on this course, which I love.

Purchased a groupon for Urbano and excited to try a Latin fusion restaurant in old town Scottsdale. Although the server was extremely kind and attentive we were sadly let down by the food. It started out well with the ambiance and look-shabby chic. We had the complementary fried plantains with spicy pico de gallo and chipotle mayo which was very good. We then had the beef and potato empanadas-they were light and crispy but beef & potatoes were kind of bland. They were good when enhanced with the pico & mayo. We also ordered the green chili burger which sounded very promising but was more like a picnic burger w/ a store bought sesame seed bun and flavorless meat. It came with fries that had crushed pepper, parsley, cotija cheese and were completely boring in taste. The spices didn't compliment the already dull fries. We also had the fish tacos that sounded divine but were fishy, (tilapia) and fell flat. All these dishes had going for them was the spicy pico de gallo. Needless to say we will not be back and would not recommend this place.

Very fresh and great tasting donuts.  Wonderful customer service.  Believe it may be family owned.  A regular stop for us.  By far, the best donuts in Phoenix.

I probably have zipped by this place dozens of times and didn't realize what I've been missing. The adobada is the best I have ever had. Hands down the best authentic street taco joint!! The adobada had such deep layers of flavor and melts in your mouth. We had ordered a variety of tacos to see which will be our go to when we return. The carne Asada had a great smoked flavor while very tender like the adobada. I also tried the chorizo and once again I savored ever bite to fully enjoy all of the spice and complimenting flavors. But it was the adobada that was the winner. I would have loved to buy a container of that meat. Open till 5 am this place will be my new late night grub stop.

I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to. There were just too many problems with our brunch at North. The best way for me to explain the 2 stars is to give you a breakdown of our experience.   We arrived at North and right away I have to say that I liked the look of the place. Very cool barn design with tons of windows and a bar that is very inviting. Well things changed as soon as we went in. First off the place was maybe 30% full so there was a ton of seating. We were shocked to hear that there was a 15 minute wait. Now I know a little about the restaurant business and it could have very well been that they were short staffed. I still think it is a much better experience for people to be seated and explain your situation.   While we were waiting outside I decided to go to the bar to get some coffee for us. The bartender didn't acknowledge me and instead decided to help the people that came in after me. I moved down the bar hoping it was because she didn't see me. Well that wasn't it because I got another 5 minutes of her avoiding me like I was Kris Humphries at a Kardashian family reunion.   Finally she took my order to which she tried having two other people fulfill it. Needless to say we were seated before I even got the coffee. Bad service.  Once we were seated things seemed to get better. We had a very nice waiter and he was very quick with getting us drinks and our order. When the food arrived things went downhill again.   My girlfriends eggs were so salty her blood pressure went from 110/60 to 180/120. She only had one bite. Her oatmeal was also missing apples which was a big part of it. She was very disappointed. Mine wasn't much better. My breakfast sandwich is something I could make at home. Very plain roll with overcooked fried egg and two skinny pieces of bacon.  The potatoes were fantastic though. Odd they give you a thick aioli that ruins the potato. Just avoid it.  I can only review this place on its brunch. I haven't been here for dinner and not really sure I will give it another try. The service from the bartender and the very sub-par food makes me want to spend my money elsewhere. There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that appreciate the business.

The concept was a great one, but the festival and the food trucks were no where close to prepared for the amount of people that showed up. Not sure if it was great marketing or groupon, but there were way too many people there or way too few of food trucks.   If this event happens again next year I would advise to either double or triple the amount of food trucks or cap the number of attendees. I would also advise of having this at a different venue or get new traffic control management.   This was our day in a nutshell. Waited 45 minutes to park. This was a little frustrating, but we were so excited it didn't seem that bad. Once we entered the event we noticed right away the lines for the food trucks were very long. We game planned to split up and get in two lines. Little did we know the lines were so slow. At one food truck there was a line to get tickets then go to another line (Epic Hotdogs).   Almost an hour and a half later we finally get some food. The hotdog was cold and obviously the ingredients had changed a little bit while we were in line. The had ran out of some ingredients and were improvising. So frustrating.  Needless to say we were able to hit only one more truck each, unfortunately we didn't go to this event to be separated. The next food truck the owner of the truck (gourmet frybreads) was extremely rude and obviously overwhelmed with the situation. We all left hungry and very let down.   I haven't even talked about the cost of everything. I had no problem with the $5 parking and the $10 cover if things were the way I expected. Everything was way too expensive for the experience. The food was way overpriced. $4 for a half a hotdog. $6.50 for a frybread with beans? Really, now the food trucks are gouging us! $7 beer? Well if you wait at the tent for a beer it's $3. The $7 beer seemed like a better deal seeing i didn't have to wait 45 minutes.   I hate to write reviews like this because I am just repeating what others are saying. If you decide to do this event next year I am sure you will make adjustments. It will have to be a lot for us to go back. Great concept but horrible execution.

This was my 3rd time running the PF Chang's and I would have to say this race is always well organized and the new route was a huge improvement in scenery. Thanks again for wrecking my legs for 48 hours! Rock N Roll Dublin next!

My local Starbucks, not much to say, I think everyone has been to one by now. I will however mention the excellent service here as well as great locale. Friendly Baristas greet you with a smile and call you by name if you've been here enough. You get the usual squatters here that take up space and bandwith, but there is usually a seat or table available inside or out. I am more of a get in and get out customer. This place does have a great view of the PHX Mountains if you're into that stuff.

I am a huge fan of Del Frisco's Double Eagle in Denver so I was very excited to see Del Frisco's come to PHX. Now this isn't the same as the Double Eagle. This is a tier below the DE and you will find less steaks and more burgers etc. The restaurant looks like a high end steak house and you may feel a little under dressed, but you will find plenty of casual dressed customers.   We have been here a few times and it has definitely improved from their first week open. DF has amazing appetizers and are perfect with either a beer or martini. My fav are the cheesesteak eggrolls. Yeah it is possible! I ordered the hatch chili burger and  was very pleased. Seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection with a bun that is one of my favs. I have also had the fish tacos which were delicious and a little more in line with my New Year diet.   I know that the reviews have been all over the place, but I do think recommend giving them a try. Try the patio upstairs in the spring. My guess it will be a great hangout with the warmer weather.

Sweet, Sour, Salty, Spicy, Smokey, Savory or wait was that Salty, Spicy, Savory, Sweet, Smokey, Sour? Crudo is a restaurant that is a carnival for your mouth. I'm not talking about clown carnival, I am talking about Carnival in Brazil kinda Carnival! Thankfully I had the perfect martini cleansing my sinning tongue as the show went on. Starting with the Antipasta Pig Ears (These strips of perfection play spice with sweet and sour), Ahi Crudo (Unreal, just unreal how good this was), Squid Ink Risotto (Savory with bits of pepper and tuna hiding in darkness), Beef Brisket (A smoked strip of beef that breaks away with the slightest tug of the fork) and to finish that parade of debauchery a strawberry balsamic creation placed perfectly in a shortbread crust.  Kudos to Crudo! So excited to come back and taste the rest of the parade of flavors.

Okay, I made a huge mistake and came here with a semi full stomach. Not much room for beer or a brat. So with that said, I can only comment on the pretzel pretty much. Holy Shit these are good! Where the hell were these when I was popping those hard nasty ass pretzels in the microwave. Baked to perfection these soft pretzels are soft and chewy yet have a nice baked crust. Salted evenly with the beer cheese for dippin, is a huge hell yeah! I will definitely be coming back to try the brats and beer. Natürlich! (I sure hope that translates to Hell Yeah!)

Man, Barrio Cafe has a very hard time trying to replicate it's original location. I had some extra time at the airport due to a weather issue and decided to charge my iphone for the tenth time at Barrio Cafe. I have given Barrio Queen a chance even though the reviews were iffy at best and found out that Barrio Cafe at the airport could be even further from the original.   Staff sucked: now this may be because it's tough to get people to work at the airport so I will let that slide.   Food: Honest to God, I wouldn't serve this to my dog. I ordered the Tacos De Arrachera (Skirt Steak) and I am not kidding when I say this cow must have either been 70 yrs old or the chef has never grilled a skirt steak in his/her life. Unchewable and absolutely flavorless!   My girlfriend and I are always debating over the Original Barrio Cafe as to whether or not it really is that good. I think one thing they are good at is ambiance. Cool Urban Mexican Art can't make up for a shit show in this kitchen.

Don't bring your Driver, just going to waste space in your bag!!  I love Driving off the tee, but on this course I found myself hitting a 7 iron mostly. I know, I know, they don't have the space, but you have three 9 hole courses maybe it would've been better to have just 2. With that said, I can't tell you how much fun and how challenging this course was without playing it before. A lot of squeezed in holes that will have you guessing distances and club choices. One thing I would highly recommend for Phoenician is carts with gps. We had a very difficult time figuring out distances.   Can't wait to play this course again next time. Probably put together the best back to back holes I have ever played. Drove par 4 then almost a hole in one on the next! Birdie Birdie.

My GF and I have been wanting to see what The Nash was all about. We were fortunate enough to be able to check out the Nash at a Yelp Event and we couldn't have been more excited about a great little jazz venue for us. Not sure if Holly Pyle plays there often, but her band was awesome. Turning today's music into jazz was something I haven't heard before. Very Cool! The Nash will be a must for us next time we are down for a First Friday! Just make sure you pack some snacks and liquids, in my case booze! Thanks again for a great time!

So happy to have my favorite sandwich shop in town!!!! Potbelly finally has made its way to AZ from Chicago. These are the things to know about Potbellys.  1. Peppers - This is my number one for them. Get the peppers!! The Potbelly peppers are by far tops to other establishments and will enhance any of their creations (besides the pb&j) 2. Bread - I always opt for my bread skinny (gutted so it more like the crispy crust without the fluff) 3. Chicken Salad - The best chicken salad sandwich I have ever had! That is saying a lot. I have had Stage Deli and even Katz's. (Make sure you get the peppers!!) 4. PB&J - I have actually flown from Chicago with one of these in my briefcase and ate it hours later. Yeah, the old school days of jelly soaked bread!!! 5. Service - Fast and always friendly!!!  Welcome to AZ Potbelly!! The one thing AZ needed, and it's doesn't need a lot, is a great sandwich place with tons of options!!!

Daily Dose midtown is a huge disappointment, gave this place a second chance and it is our last. Service couldn't be worse. Most of the staff doesn't seem to care about it's customers or the place itself. This place seemed night and day compared to the Old Town location. Better pick it up or Snooze will hurt their biz for sure.

I hate my morning flights out of Sky Harbor, but there is one place there that makes the check in and security line a little more tolerable. Cartel Coffee Lab on the C Concourse. I will make a quick run down there to get my latte before the flight out of AZ. As good as any of the other Cartels in town, this place has great service and awesome coffee goodness that will get you thru that flight with the crying kid and odd smell that is coming from seat 8C.

I actually took my time going to The Yard due to the craziness this place got when it first opened. We ended up going to Little Cleo's and had a great dinner. I'm not a huge fan of the Fox Concept restaurants, but we had a great experience at Little Cleo's. We wanted to stay around to play some of the games, but didn't have the time. We will definitely be back to have the full Yard experience. I am a sucker for Cornhole and Ping Pong so this place is calling me back for sure. We didn't have any problems with parking and the wait for games didn't seem long so don't get discourage at some of the reviews.

Original ChopShop is a great place for some fresh food to revive that nutrient poor body of mine. Sandwiches are awesome and are big enough to feed a family of 6. Fresh ingredients and drinks. Great place to add in your diet or healthy lifestyle.

Poor blind pig, ended up in a butcher case! Now I didn't get the chance to order up some of that pig, but I did have a great order of Carne Asada Tacos! Now there isn't much to a carne asada taco, but mess up one or two of these ingredients and I'm out. Number 1 and my most important ingredient is the meat. The Blind Pig seasoned the meat perfectly and grilled to perfection. Meat wasn't dry and trimmed of all fat. Number 2 is the tortilla, has to be homemade or from a local tortillaria. The tortilla was from one of those. Soft corn tortillas that didn't break and had some flavor to them. The rest of the ingredients just need to be fresh. Make sure you get the chips and salsa. Once again made there or somewhere in town. Looking forward to going back to The Blind Pig and trying some of the other refrigerated animals in the butcher case!!

Alright, fine, I know, wtf, I didn't think so either, but yeah, I am doing a review of Twin Peaks. Now, I will confess I am a regular in this place when football season is in full swing, but I can say, without a doubt I come for the games, cold ass beer and great tv coverage. Yes, they do have some lightly clothed waitresses, but that is just a small part of what this place offers. I have never had a beer as cold as Twin Peaks. They serve these things (usually below 30 degrees temp) in a big f*ing glass with a nice slush floating on top. The beer alone is worth the trip! The one thing that knocks this place down a notch is the food. Had a couple things now, but I would only vouch for the queso. Always a great game and good prices at Twin Peaks. Oh yeah, chicks in little lumber gear too. Let's go Broncos!!

Unicorn Blood! This shit is so good no wonder they're extinct! I went to pick up a 6-pack of juices for me and my gal the other day and walking into this joint you get hit by the fresh smell of veggies and fruit. I am not going to lie to you and make it sound like I am some health nut. Far from it, I eat burgers and drink martinis! Since I tend to treat my body like a bar more than a temple I figured I should give this juice thing a try. Been drinking odd colored and odd smelling drinks for a month now and I would have to say I do feel better and look like I am maybe 4 weeks younger! Well I can't vouch how it compares to other juice places since I am still a newbie, but Juice Core definitely is a great place to drop in and get some healthy shit!

You bring me back to Maui!! Wait, I'm in landlocked Phoenix? How does this fish taste as fresh as it does in the desert of PHX? Simple menu with a clean surf motif dining room, Coconuts is a straight forward seafood paradise in the heart of the desert. Started with the Coconut Shrimp App, awesome shrimp with a delicious chili sauce! Make sure you check in and get the app at a discount! For Dinner I went for the fish and chips. The fish isn't like your typical beer batter fish, but a light crispy layer of panko (I believe) covering a mild moist fish. I believe that the fish is only frozen once based on the taste. I also snagged a taste of my GF's fish tacos, that mango salsa, cabbage and ono is unreal. That taco will make you feel like your on the beach in Lahaina watching dolphins play with mermaids. Yeah, they exist! Coconut's, Mahalo nui loa!!!

Spending a bunch of my life living in San Diego I have always stayed away from seafood in landlocked cities like PHX. I became a huge seafood snob. Little Cleo's was one of the few seafood places I have tried in the valley. I was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the fish and crab were. Fish was light and flaky and didn't have the frozen fish taste. The warm jar of King Crab and butter was phenomenal! Loved the decor and felt like I was at an oyster house on the east coast. Little Cleo's deserves the 4 1/2 stars. Thank's again Yelpers for the spot on ratings.

The corned beef hash I have been missing since I left Denver is now in PHX! Made me do a little Irish jump and punch a hole in my wall. Hey, I'm Irish, I can say that! Snooze finally made it's way to Phoenix and it didn't take long for the Colorado transplants to find it as well as the breakfast foodies. Now if we could only get Root Down and Sassafras here.   Now prepare yourself for a 30 to 45 minute wait for a table, but the complimentary coffee does help pass that time. Whether you are a pancake breakfast glutton or a hung over savory breakfast bum like me Snooze will have everything to get that morning fix.   Service here is just as good as the food. We had a couple mix ups with drink orders, but that never bothers me. Take some time and figure out your choice from the large menu, don't worry if you wanted to try a couple things, you'll be back!

How does Phoenix have so many amazing pizza places? I mean, how? My previous home cities of San Diego and Denver didn't have one! This place has put me in a bind. Cibo was hands down my favorite, now this place comes in and screws everything up for me. Can you have two number 1's?  Pomo is a super cool place with a nice vibe with it's patio that connects with the bar. The pizza is tops in town. Have tried a few of them now and everyone one of them have been delicious.   The service is fantastic and you can tell the owner is appreciative of his customers. Like other reviewers, he came over to our table and gave us his homemade limoncello shots which were phenomenal!!! Thanks Pomo, we'll be back for sure.

How the hell does a small, out of date strip mall like this have 2 amazing restaurants?!? With Crudo right behind this place you may overlook this little Nook. Well, opening the doors to this place you go from a ugh I don't want to be seen in front of this building (JK) to a whole different feeling. Cool little dark feel and vibe to this place. Raised, half circled booths line the length of the long restaurant and gives it a more intimate feel. Of course, I came for takeout, idiot!! Trust me I will be back to enjoy the restaurant next time. Anyways, for starters we got the fig bruschetta with asparagus and prosciutto (you put this on anything and I'm all in!!). Nailed it!! The Diavolo pizza was next! Now next to prosciutto on my list of meats I must devour is soppressata. Well chorizo, then soppressata. Thin sliced soppressata accompanied by fresh mozzarella and basil. Hellz yeah good. The soppressata has some good heat to it so be warned if you don't like spice! Nook is yet one of many unreal good pizza joints in town. I swear it must be these chefs reproducing at alarming rates. How can you have so many great pizza places? Nook Nailed it!!! I will update my review after I eat here. Might be a 5 star

Wow! Damn this place is good. Not a really appealing place from the front, but as you walk in you are welcomed by a shout out from the Sushi Chefs. Love it, just wished I knew what the hell they were saying. The decor and ambiance isn't the most intimate, but you really don't come here for that. This is the breakdown of the sea carnage that went down at our table of 2.   Toro - Not always available, we jumped at the opportunity to indulge in the belly of beast! Melts in your mouth delicious!!!  Shrimp Tempura - Tempura is always touchy for me. The batter is everything and a lot of times its too thick. Harumi's tempura was perfect! Almost as good as my favorite place in Maui (Sansei).   Stuffed Jalapenos - You did what with that pepper? You stuffed it with crab and tempura'd that garnish from south of the border? Yeah, and it works.   Ramen - Hey, you can't pass up an chance to have Ramen that isn't out of a bag! We really didn't expect the kick that this ramen had, but luckily for me it was so spicy that it was all mine to slurp and gulp!! No dry seasoning packets used in this bowl. Awesomeness.  Service is fast and friendly! Thanks for a great night Harumi. Will definitely be back to try so many other items.

So happy to see Essence make it's way into my neck of the woods. I am kinda shocked at the rating so far, but maybe it has to do with a rough opening. I ordered the chicken club sandwich and it was everything I expected. I totally blew it though, stupid diet reasons made me pass on the macaroons. It's worth a trip to Essence just for those. I think once the staff is up to snuff this place will be as good as the Tempe location.

I frequent La Grande a ton and saw this place being built over the last 15 years. Hahahaha, sure as hell seemed like 15 years. I was shocked that it was a restaurant going in this tiny little round building. I finally tried it a week an half ago and I couldn't have been more rewarded for my wait. I keep having to update my fav burgers in Phoenix and I have to say it. Ingos is it!! The Stand and Delux have been knocked down the list.   Backing it up this way -  Bun - Ingo's (Light and perfect size) Meat - Ingo's (Seasoned right, juicy and medium rare) Sauce - Ingo's (Whatever the hell it is it's delicious!) Fries/Potato Chips - Ingo's (These PC are something else. Worth the trip alone) Service - Ingo's (Great personable service. Goes a long, long way)  La Grande Hospitality has done it again. Another great concept restaurant that was thought out, from the space to the menu. There are a lot of conceptual restaurant groups in town and they usually fall short. Good job LGO, when do you open The Luggage Room here?

Uber! I can't tell you how much I love this App! I am a religious Uber passenger, and with my nights out trying food and martinis around town, this is the app that get's me home safe. I use it for getting to the airport as well. Slightly more than a dirty, smelly cab ride, Uber gives you the option of either a towncar/SUV or UberX which is something I haven't tried yet, but is personal vehicles of new Uber Drivers.   I can't tell you how many times I have had a cab come for me and not show up because they find someone else on the way. Uber app makes it so easy to have a car within 15 minutes all which you can see on your app where they are on the way. I will never take a cab again!   Remember the tip is included!!!

Chef Helen Yung, you made a guy who didn't really like ice cream, LOVE IT!! I will follow Chef Helen Yung to any restaurant, ice cream joint, pop up kitchen, festival or house party!! This gal owns the kitchen!! Holy shit I sound like a stalker, trust me I'm not!! Your mint ice cream is my fav, wait, no, it's the brownie swirl or is it the chocolate? No, it's the ice cream sandwich with those damn cookies (positive damn) with cookies cream ice cream. Or is it the rocky road with the homemade marshmallows? Yeah, I've been here that many times. Not sure which is my fav, but give this place a try if you haven't and figure out yours. Chef Helen, thanks for the additonal 5 lbs I need to run off. I'll do it while I follow you around town! JK!!!

Wow, it doesn't get much better than this!!! First off, the Luche Libre paraphernalia is worth the trip alone. Love that shit!! Okay, those are just decorations and you don't go for that alone. We got there just before the dinner rush and as we checked out the menu the gal behind the counter offered us a sampling of all of their different marinated meats. Samples of the pork, beef and chicken?! Hell yeah they'll do that! You have any more kinds of marinated animal back there? Alright, got some street tacos go down the line and add some fresh garnish! Best street tacos in town!! This is how the match went down.  Chips and Salsa - Bam!!! Who doesn't like salsa bars?! Nice thin salted chips with many different salsas full of flavor and punch!!  3 Street Tacos (tried the carne asada, carnitas and pollo) - Kaboom!!! While your munching on those tacos you are getting whooped by flavor. Fresh corn tortillas, cilantro, onions, crema etc!!! Shit, my glittering spandex shorts feeling tighter! I'll just cover up my belly with my cape.  Hands down, get your ass to the corner of the ring, the match is over!! Love Lucha Libre and Love Santos Lucha Libre even more!!! Merodeador Irlandés - that's my Lucha Libre name. You'll find me wrestling Sunday's at various VFW's in the valley.

Flippin love this place!! I have always been the kinda golfer who likes cocktails and music when I'm out on the course. Topgolf is my kinda place!! A place where I can be competitive and enjoy some good cocktails, food and music. This isn't a golf course, but the way the range and games are laid out you really get the challenge of golf, minus the putting. Topgolf did a great job with it's staff and the food is great pub grub. Can't wait to take some more friends and family to my new practice range. Oh yeah, Talking Stick is right across the parking lot. GAME ON!!!

What the hell is going on with Topgolf? First you cut the rubber tees off, then no woods or hybrids, now you can't hit your own irons on two levels? I can't believe that they didn't figure this out before. Huge disappointment! I used to love going to this place, but now it's more like putt putt entertainment. A good thing gone bad by just a few golfers. Use your microchip technology and eliminate the golfers who are launching over the net!

Flower Child? What has happened to me? I used to be such an In n Out, Carolina's kinda guy. Has the desert softened me? When I entered and looked around I was surprised it wasn't full of California Soccer Mom's who love participation trophies. Oh, I'm so going to hear it for that, damn I need a filter.   Flower Child has an open and bright restaurant that is great for business meetings, quick friend lunches or planning neighborhood quail crossings (do flower children do that?). I ordered take out since I didn't want to commit to a sit down without seeing my surroundings.   I ordered the Thai Cashew Bowl with some chicken. Quinoa (spelling, grain?) with jalapeno, snap peas, celery, mushroom, cashews and Thai basil!! Holy shit these saguaro hugging hippies (ouch) can make me forget about methane producing cow burgers!! The quinoa was the perfect texture with crisp snap peas and spicy jalapenos. Great flavor with the tender chicken. I would highly recommend adding a meat or tofu for a little heartier meal. I would have given this place 5 stars, but for the price I would have expected more meat and a little bigger portion. I just came back from a run and was absolutely starving. What's not to love about eating healthy and the good news is I didn't smell any patchouli oil!!

I should be out running right now and not writing this review, but with Urban Taco fresh in my mind and belly I thought I would crank it out. Place is near my new fav bar Linger Longer Lounge so that's a plus! Okay, it's a Thursday night and I have been drinking for about two weeks straight so this was a food only mission. My gal and I ordered up some chips and a grouping of salsas. All but one of the salsas were shockingly thick. But don't worry, these salsas will get any mariachi band up and trumpeting. Roasted corn, avocado crema, green chili w/ cilantro, cucumber and roasted tomato/poblano. Usually there will be a salsa that falls flat. Not here, all are loaded with flavor and with the thin chips are a must! Wow, I could really use a pacifico beer. No, stay focused and dry!! Next on the list is two street tacos. Pork belly with potato? What, can you mix that shit? Hell yeah, and to my surprise it was a mashed potato. Unreal. All I can say is unreal. My second choice, the short rib. Moist (hate that word) short rib with some greens and sauce. Delicious! Now the gathering tables will leave you little room for your thighs and the service can be a bit dodgy, but they are very friendly and appreciate the business.

Booze... Music... Dancing...  Booze.... Intermission... Booze... Music... Dancing..... Booze  That seems to be my order of events when I go to Livewire. Been here a couple times, first time I can barely remember since this was the last bar I hit in Old Town. The last time I went it was to go back to the 80's with The English Beat. The venue is laid out well with ample dance space and seating just off the sides for the more passive crowd. There is also seating and views on the second level accompanied by another bar as well. Being a new venue the sound is superior to other venues in the valley so if you have a band to see here it's worth it.   Alright, now the little downside to this place. The bartenders couldn't make a proper drink if their life depended on it. After multiple errors, I switched to bottled beer knowing it would be tough to screw that up. Sometimes places opt for looks rather than pouring talent. This is one of those places. I guess they are just trying to keep up with the other bars in the area. I might have to check out Blues Traveler in October!

Oh boy did I Linger Longer here!! I am a huge fan of Little Woodies and just as big of a fan of this place! I went to the old 16th St. bar and the bar made no sense with the two rooms, but this concept was perfect for this location. The main bar is a dark intimate bar with high booths and hightops making it easy to have either small personable gathering to being a part of the general population at the bar. Speaking of the bar, these bartenders know what the hell they're doing and it's worth bellying up at this place. The bar top is one of the coolest I've seen and the bartenders are friendly and personable. Wow, what an improvement on 16th st. The old pool room is now the game room. Skeeball (lost), darts (won), foosball (won) and shuffleboard (didn't play). Shit, what the hell is my problem with skeeball?! I can't roll the damn thing straight! Hours of fun and competition, but if you need a break there is seating off to the side or you can hang in the open air patio between the two spots. Linger Longer is on my list of go to bars in the valley! Damn, that list is getting a little long.

What a great addition to Tempe. Being a fan of good comfort food, cocktails, live music and games, The Yard is made for me!! I've been to the Yard in Central Phoenix and I would have to say I like this one better. Better ambiance and feel to it. The servers are super attentive and friendly, the food is fantastic, the booze is spot on, the music sets the tone and the games bring out my competitive side. Make sure you check out the Showcase room! Super cool place to have private parties. The Yard kicks ass, oh and so did I in foosball and bags!!

Germ gel, where are you!!! Man this place is nasty! Okay, it's a bowling alley, I totally get it, but just update this place a little more and maybe clean it a ton more. The prices seemed great so if you're going with a group or family you'll save a ton over Lucky Strike. I think I would have given a higher rating if the service was even acceptable. Our server was not only inept at her job she was rude to one in our party. She made a mistake and instead of correcting it she blamed the person that ordered and then rolled her eyes. Maybe she was just having a bad night. Either way, not the greatest bowling alley. Great place for the price, but you will compromise a couple things.

Fuck n Right on!! That would be my name of this restaurant. Sorry for my language, I really only swear on my reviews. Buck & Rider is an amazing addition from LGO and the seafood go to in PHX!!   I would have to say this is by far my favorite restaurant decor in the LGO family. The inside has a cool feel to it, I guess it was conceptualized after a house in Australia. High ceilings and lighting that ranges from an old chandelier to trees with small white lights. Either way this is the perfect place for that intimate date night with your significant other!! Now the food will help you there too with your lady! Nik Niks will get you Nik Niks they say, well at least that's what I say!!  This was our second time here and what brought us back was those little Nik Niks! We decided to go for a few different starters. We went with the crab dip: rich crab dip with a little spice which I believe was jalapeno. This cheesy dip goes perfect with the gluten free (not sure why) crackers with watermelon radish. We also got the Thai King Crab Salad: Okay, I swear the dressing is the same as the LGO Thai Chicken Salad. The Crab Salad was unreal good. Really surprised it worked so well with the Mango. Now the Nik Niks: These little buttery beauties are like oysters. Not sure exactly what's in these, but if Pfizer ever got their hands on these they may have the viagra for woman. Now food has never gotten me hot and bothered, but that's alright, I just need my lady that way!!! Haha. Order the Nik Niks!  Buck and Rider has a great selection of wines and full bar to fit any of your boozing needs!! If you leave here and your lady isn't ready to go home with you I would suggest taking your girlfriend somewhere cheaper or finding a foodie girl!! Buck & Rider / Fuck n Right on

Have to say my first experience was not a great one of Chestnut. Came here for two things, grab a latte and Camelback Flower Shop. One, the flower shop was closed, not sure that makes any sense on a weekend. I love the Camelback Flower Shop, but they really should be open on Sundays at Chestnut. Second, and this is my reason for the 2 stars, the service is horrible here. With only 2 of us in line how can ordering and receiving a latte take 20 minutes. The staff runs around like they're lost and there is no communication. Employees would rather talk to each other than acknowledge they have a customer waiting to order. I really don't think I will ever go here again. Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.
