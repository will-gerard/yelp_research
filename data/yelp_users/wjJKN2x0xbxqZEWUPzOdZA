They've really done a phenomenal job with our dog. She had a severe chafing issue from a tight dog shirt she was wearing. Her wounds were deep and infected and the staff did such a great job getting us in and treating her. She is still being seen here for wound treatment, but we have been very satisfied with their work here.

I have never been to a pizzeria that is literally packed all the time. That already says a lot about this place. Excellent food and service. We order pizza here every week and we love it.   They have a private party room that is booked every time I'm there. Looks fun!!  We'll keep coming back to this place!

Took my daughter here this morning for some lab work around 9:30am. The place was extremely busy and we hardly found seats to ourselves. This was to be expected though. Most people are fasting from the night before and are in a rush to get their lab work done as early as possible so they can go back to eating. This wasn't the case for us, but could explain the packed waiting room.   Patients were called back one right after the other, and just as soon as patients were being seen, more were coming in.   We were finally seen an hour later. I really wasn't disappointed given the amount of people that were there. As I said earlier, the flow was was pretty consistent with patients being called back.   I would come here again, but I would take advantage of their appointment scheduling that can be done online.

Just tried this place twice this week, after reading the previous reviews. Checked out the menu online and ordered a variety of platters to-go for my family.  When I went there, I noticed that the menu online is priced very differently than the one inside the joint. About a dollar difference, but still.....I went there expecting my total to be a bit different than what it was. Hopefully that will be fixed soon.  Ordered the Chicken Yakisoba for myself the first night along with some crab puffs and veggie eggrolls.  Wasn't impressed with the Yakisoba.  Thought it was a bit dry and lacked flavor.  The crab puffs and egg rolls werent anything to anything to brag about. Pretty standard.  Tried my husband's chicken teriyaki plate and thought it tasted really good.  What really DID impress me about this place was the portion size.  You REALLY do get quite a bit of food.  I enjoyed the chicken teriyaki so much that I ended up getting it again the following day.   The little old Japanese guy in the front is hilarious, and worth the trip just to see him. IMO.  I will be returning to try their other plates.

I've been coming here for the last 20 years. I love this place! The food is always made to order, quick and delicious. Best time to get there is when they open because the lunch crowd can really pack that tiny place up. I will continue to come here once a month like I usually do.

This is my alma mater so OF COURSE I'm giving it 5 stars. Lived on campus my first two years.  Freshman year spent in Manzanita Hall and Sophomore year spent in Cholla. I graduated in 4 years with a degree in Psychology and a minor in Art History. I had a fantastic college experience and never felt that my $ was being wasted. It's a beautiful campus and so much has been added (and removed) since I went there. I had a great advisor to guide me and a wonderful group of teachers.  The biggest help, I felt, were the friends and study buddies I met along the way. I'm a proud ASU alum.

I absolutely love this restaurant and it's always my highly suggested Mexican food place for out of town guests....mainly because I look forward to seeing their faces when they try the hot spicy foods.   My go-to entrees have always been the enchilada dinner or the chile relleno plate. Both come with a side of rice and beans and a homemade tortilla.   My only complaint about this place is the fact that they don't serve fried ice cream. They have sopapillas and flan, but I always need that ice cream to complete my mexican meals.

Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.  Cons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees).   Also, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit.

I really like this place and I am SO upset that they closed down this location for good. Please come back! Phoenix is great and all, but all of us in the East Valley need you back. So please find a better location and re-open. I'm fairly certain that the bizarre location was what did it for them.   At any rate, if you visit the Chinos that IS open, here is what you should order:  Emerald Chicken Quesadilla Jade Red Chicken Jerk Fried Rice Refried Beans  You can thank me later.

This is definitely a place that I WISH would move to a larger location so that more patrons can sit inside. They have a bizarre seating rule which I think others have posted about on here and it's true. The best time to arrive is right when they open. That way, you are guaranteed a seat. The place is very small and dark. Their food is absolutely incredible though. My favorite, hands down, was the lobster roll. Quite pricey, but SO worth it. I preferred a California roll from here and loved the flaming sugar cube that accompanied it.  Very cool to watch. I'm dying to return here soon.

Tried this place for the first time last week. Food was great and so was the service too. My friend and I ordered the cilantro lime crab dip. It was a very refreshing dip. Not a warm one like most dips are so this would definitely be an excellent choice during the summer for an appetizer.   I ordered the blackened BLT and my friend ordered the short rib enchiladas. I really enjoyed my sandwich. I was worried that the fish would come out dry since most salmon in sandwiches are thin and over cooked. This was actually a nice thick moist piece and it was cooked perfectly. I had a side of sweet potato chips that were lightly sprinkled with salt. It was a nice addition to the sandwich.  This is a great place to take your girlfriends to if you happen to be in the DC Ranch area.   There are plenty of tables outside and they keep all the windows open for inside seating. I imagine it would be quite crowded in the summertime there with people choosing to sit indoors.   Average price for meals and appetizers was around $15 each. Well worth it.

This was my first time here, but what a really cute little theater. There is only bottom level seating with the upper level being the sound/light controls.   Saw the MAC Dance Company perform here and it was absolutely beautiful.   There is a very small front lobby with restrooms in the front. There are several steps to get into the theater, but there is a wheelchair access ramp on the side.   I'll look forward to seeing other performances here in the future.

I really like this place. This was my first time here after driving by it several times. Met a friend for breakfast and had the huevos rancheros plate. The side of lentil pico de gallo was amazing. My one year old enjoyed the kiddie flap jacks.   I didn't get a chance to look at the entire market since I was on a time crunch but I hope to be back soon.   The only thing disappointing here is the access to the restroom. I had to take my daughter there and had to wait until the line to order died down just so I could squeeze through. And when we were finally done, I had to wait again just to get back to my seat. Not convenient and I'm not even sure it's wheelchair accessible. Not cool. Or maybe I'm missing another restroom somewhere else there?

Ive been meaning to write a review on this place for a long time.  This is a GREAT resale store and you really need to go through each item carefully. I promise you will find something completely unique and name brand.  They have a huge inventory and everyone here is SO nice and helpful. Also, the prices are incredible.  I leave here with bags and bags of items....always.  I know how resales work because I have a friend that owns a large one in Phoenix.  They may not take your items because sometimes they already have a lot of those items already in, or maybe it's not in with the season, or maybe it's a design that just doesnt sell quickly off the shelves. It's always easy for us as buyers to question why a resale store wont take our items, but I feel like they have always been fair.  You have the option here for them to give you cash or a store credit. I always opt for the store credit because I love their selection and I can always find something fashionable.  My last trip here was last week and I was able to buy my daughter brand new outfits for the winter. Brand spankin' new with original tags at a super deal!  Seriously, if you are looking for a trendy place to buy clothes, books, shoes, toy,s diaper bags, slings or anything else for your kids; go here!

Ahwatukee is known for having a lot of chain restaurants. Luckily, this isn't one of them which is all the more reason to hit up his spot. They have a great indoor space with a market as well as a nice outdoor patio. The staff has always been overly helpful, nice and prompt. I have been to this place twice and ordered the same exact thing because it is THAT good. It's a very laid back place and I love the versatility of it. Great for studying, meeting up with a business client, hanging with a friend or even for a larger social crowd. The food is excellent!! Check them out if you are in this area.

Whenever Im in this area of town and I need a fast-food place, I always hit up Federico's.   Call me boring, but I LOVE bean and cheese burritos. And this place really does an excellent job on them.  They are about 3 times the size of a lot of local spots nearby and the beans taste like the ones my Nana used to make. And Im convinced my Nana made the best beans around.  They also add a white cheese (asadero) to them which tastes a heck of a lot better than the standard cheddar that some places add to their burritos.  I havent tried anything else here so my review is based strictly on the bean and cheese burritos.  If I lived a bit closer, I would try some other items on the menu, but for now please take my word that these burritos are really good. Havent been disappointed yet.

I went here months ago and haven't returned. I purchased 3 bean burritos for the kids and myself, bought a few extra tortillas and 3 drinks. We pulled over in the parking lot to eat in the car. I was dispersing some of the beans in the burrito to one of the extra tortillas I bought, and I found a bug inside the burrito. I pulled it out and told the kids to stop eating. I had them examine it just to make sure I wasn't going crazy.   I immediately drove back to the window and showed the cashier what I had found. She brought the cook over who insisted it was just a burnt piece of tortilla.   I guess burnt pieces of tortilla also have wings and legs?  They failed to agree it was a bug but returned all of my $ to me.   I have never been back and will never ever return to this Filibertos. Gross!!

I am only giving this place 1 star because I cant give it zero.  This place is absolutely disgusting.  We drove by this place a lot in the past week because we were frequenting South Mountain Preserve and with all the blazing lights outside, we thought this place was literally beckoning us to try them out.  I'm already not a huge fan of buffets for hygienic reasons and because most buffets are built for high capacity food to be dished out quickly. As a result the foods in buffets are rarely ever made fresh. But there are a few I'm actually impressed with, so I cant completely disregard buffets as a whole.  The outside of this place looks like a Chinese ski lodge with a neon light trim. There is nothing around it except for a Circle K across the street, so this place really stands out.  Kids under 2 eat free. I kinda wish we were all under 2 years old tonight for this meal.  The cashier was friendly, the host was weird about seating us and our server was probably the best part about that place. So II'll take back my first sentence, Id like to give that one star to her.  The place was very busy which I thought was a sure sign that it was going to be a great buffet, but I took a good look around. A reaaallllly good look.  If you took every single person that was on parole in AZ and seated them at a Chinese buffet, that's what you would get. 'Twas a bit creepy in there.  Aside from that, let me get down to the food....  I took a little bit of everything.  It's what I always do.  The food looked weird to me, like it was purchased from the supermarket, thawed out and placed under the heat lamp for everyone.  The ONLY items that looked normal were the jello (which is already a bizarre food anyway), the rice and the ice cream.  That's it. The sushi was an absolute joke, fried fish was bready and greasy, jalapeno chicken/sweet n sour chicken all tasted like a packet of syrup was mixed and then drizzled on top.  My son (who actually has an excellent palate) said the pizza tasted like yogurt. Like YOGURT!   Quite possibly the most unsightly thing I saw tonight was a seafood blend (casserole) that looked like somebody vomited on the tray.  I saw two scrapes taken from that tray. I'll say a prayer for the 1-2 individuals who ate that tonight because that was absolutely disgusting.  There is so much food there and I'd love to go through the list, but to be honest there's no point.  Just dont go there.  Save your money and go elsewhere. Anywhere but there.

I gave this place two chances to prove itself, but they have failed me. Visited this place when all the hype came about but was severely disappointed in both the size and taste of these tacos. Yes, I know they are street tacos and they run small, but I had to order 20 just to get a good fill, so I decided to order every kind of taco they had. I wish I could tell you what those tacos tasted like, but they all lacked flavor ....literally no flavor.  I'm quite shocked at the reviews raving about the best tacos around....clearly  these tacos do not fit in any kind of a "good" category.

Called the day before to find out when they would open on Sunday and if they would have 3lbs of BBQ beef brisket available, or if I had to pre-order.  I was told they would open at 11am and they would have it available tomorrow and I wouldn't need to pre-order for 3 lbs of the beef brisket.   On Sunday I showed up at 11am only to find they had new store hours posted that they open at 2p.   I called 10 minutes before 2p and a gentleman told me they would in fact be open at 2pm today. I asked if they would have any BBQ beef brisket available when they open.....specifically 3 lbs.  He told me they would. I arrived 20 minutes after they opened, only to be told that they did not have any BBQ beef brisket left. I can't imagine that the beef brisket sold out within the first 20 minutes. It clearly was not that busy. Awful customer service. No apology. I was looking forward to this place, but now I am never coming back. Wasted 2 car trips to get nothing.

What I love most is the simplicity of their cakes. Nothing over top and crazy like you see at other bakeries.   The red velvet is absolutely divine, but I'm also a fan of their carrot cake as well. If you're not into cakes, they also have "bundtinis", which are smaller versions of their cakes (cupcakes) and they are SUPER cute! They are perfect for smaller gatherings, plus you can select from a variety of other flavors, so you have a nice selection.   We've ordered bundtinis and cakes from here. The smallest cake was just the right amount for 10 adults with some extra slices leftover.  The customer service is great, and the interior us very clean.   I'll definitely keep coming back here.

I absolutely LOVE local businesses!  And I am such a sucker for coffee shops.  They are so cute!  The best part about this coffee shop is the fact that it has a drive-thru.  To the owner who decided to add this perk--thank you!!  You are so smart!  Best drink?  Mexican mocha.  Love it! I get mine with almond milk and it tastes SO good!  I'll be frequenting this place more and more!

I really like this facility. We mainly use this facility for their diving program. The pools here are always so clean, and the coaches are excellent. I wish that their shade structure were a bit larger though. During the summer months, some of the seating there can be quite unbearable due to the lack of shade.  It is a very small community pool compared to ones located in Chandler and Tempe.

I was extremely impressed with this place. I met a friend here for brunch and I was very surprised with how great this restaurant looked inside as well as how delicious the food was. This was my first trip here and it took me a few minutes to figure out how we were to be seated. I was expecting a host/hostess to seat us but when I looked around I didn't see anyone. There was a counter off to the side where everyone orders from. After your order and pay, you take your number and seat yourself.   I ordered a quinoa breakfast burrito which had organic eggs, quinoa, black beans, roasted corn, pasilla chile, avocado and pepperjack cheese wrapped into a tortilla.   It was so yummy. I ordered an iced coffee that was good. My daughter had a blueberry muffin, a side of scrambled eggs and freshly squeezed orange juice.   This is a great place for meeting clients, friends and even to just work alone. They have a room off to the side with large tables where everyone seemed to be working in their laptops. Very cool!! I will be returning!!

LOVE this place. Great for meeting friends or taking the family to. There are so many great combinations of food. The menu is simple yet it leaves you with an abundance of options. You order at the counter up front, pay and take your number to any table. They'll bring the food to you. Service is quick and they are keen on removing plates that you've set aside. They offer a wide variety of delicious self serve lemonades. I honestly believe they serve some of the best in the valley. I had a watermelon pomegranate one. Food is fantastic. I had the flying avocado wrap this time which was huge and delicious. I loved the shaved grilled chicken on the inside. I ordered a side of spicy Japanese eggplant. I almost inhaled the plate because it was so yummy. I would probably have to come here over 100 times to try the various combos they offer. Great service and food. Of course I'll be back!

This is such a fun place, and I'll definitely be going back for more. I originally completely overlooked this place while at the mall. It's located in the food court, but it's off to the side and has a very innovative storefront, so I kinda mistook took it for an electronics store at first.  I ordered a "hug" sized (small) blended "Clueless" drink. It was a combination of guava, watermelon, lemon, strawberry and green. And it had gobi lychee poppers in it. I'm such a kid about it and found the gobi poppers to be quite fun.   They seal your drink with a plastic top and provide you with a thick straw. You have to stab the straw into the plastic seal to break it open. So much fun! This was such a cute place and I'll can't wait to return!

This place is probably one of my favorite bakeries in the valley. Not only because they are able to execute some of the most difficult requests for cake decorations and cupcake decor, but also because they have amazing customer service. Every time I have gone in, I am greeted with a pleasant smile and a conversation. They have different cupcakes laid out every time. I can say that almost each one is my favorite. :)   What I love most about this place is there constant promotions. They offer "happy hours" a few days a week where they sell their cupcakes for only $1 and you are allowed as many as you'd like. The other thing I admire most about this place are their summer promotions. They do fun-themed promotions for free cupcakes: "mustache day", "prince/princess day", "flip-flop day" etc.... Usually they'll list the dates on their FB page.   I have ordered both custom birthday cakes as well as cupcakes for large parties I have hosted. I have been very pleased each time and that's what keeps me coming back.   The decor inside is bright and fun. They have a few tables inside for seating and another sitting area in the back for bridal clients.   I highly recommend this place if you are looking for cakes and cupcakes that are delicious and amazingly decorated.

I know this place is relatively new, so I gave it quite some time to work out any kinks before I actually stopped in. I came here late on a Friday night with my friend and our kids. I was glad that the place and the menu were kid friendly. That's a huge plus for me. The hostess was nice as was the waitress who was super sweet. But let's get down to the real business here, the food.   I was completely unimpressed with the food.  The entire menu should be completely revamped because none of the appetizers correlated with the food that was served. For example, we ordered a seafood guacamole appetizer with lump crab and shrimp, yet no where on the rest of the menu is there any other crab entrees. Usually in other restaurants, these appetizers serve as a tease for what's to come or give a hint as to what is offered with the larger entrees. The only other fish was salmon and trout. And may I also add that my daughter and I got food poisoning from this guacamole because it was the only thing in common that her and I ate and 24 hours later we were super sick.   The pretzel twist appetizers were a complete joke. Two pretzel pieces and to add cheese it was a dollar extra. The cheese should be included instead of used as an add-on. The appetizer itself was so small that my kids were literally laughing. They are definitely skimping customers on this one.   I ordered 3 tacos. 2 chicken and a shrimp. They were completely tasteless and the chicken was so dry that I pulled it out and just ate the tortilla instead. My son ordered the chicken and waffle meal. While the presentation was impressive, the meal itself was awful. The chicken, waffles, cheese and pickles were all layered on top of one another and honestly should have been separated. My son has a very good palette and he nearly vomited at the table. I ended up getting it boxed to bring home and even my husband hated it.   Here are my hopes for this place....clean up the menu, bigger portions on the appetizers (especially that joke of pretzel twists) and hire a new chef. This place actually has great potential. They have an awesome location, and the place itself is great for large groups and families. I could really see this place take off if the menu were a lot better.

Went here today after feeling sick for well over a week. Found this place after doing a search on Yelp. I was very pleased with the service here. The lobby is very clean and the front desk receptionist was very helpful and prompt with the paperwork. My wait time was probably 5-10 minutes. Just enough time to fill out the forms.   As soon as I was in, I received my vitals from the nurse and was immediately seen by the physician. It was very quick, and the doctor actually sat down and explained what prescriptions she was going to prescribe and how they would each work. She wasn't rushed and I appreciated that. Great bedside manner.   I was in and out within 30 minutes. I'll definitely be back if I'm in a pinch with getting a regular doctors appt through my PCP.   Great facility and service.

I was SO excited when this DD moved into my neighborhood. I drove by it every day and I was there the second they opened for their Grand Opening. On my first time there, I was very pleasantly greeted by their staff who asked if I was a regular. It must've been the way I ordered my coffee. I have continued to go there every week since they have opened, but I know that quite a few things have changed and it's really bothering me.   This review is strictly on the customer service that I am beginning to really dislike. Not one person looks like they are happy to work here, and they make me feel like I am completely inconveniencing them. I thought for sure from the very first day that this was going to be a great DD to go to. Everyone is so personable at the other two locations I visit, and I guess I thought this one would be the same.   If this sour attitude and unhappiness continues, I will take my business elsewhere.

Dunkin Donuts is going to have quite the competitor with Bosa now open across the street. Love their donuts here!  Everything is hot and fresh and it's no wonder that this place is always insanely busy--their donuts are that good.   I was stoked to have Bosa move to my neighborhood. Now I'll be here every day.

This place is ridiculously delicious!!!  We used to frequent another hot spot in the valley for thai food, but we will for sure be coming here from now on. I went in and ordered the chicken satay and crab delights as appetizers. They were both delicious. The chicken satay came in skewers wth a side of peanut sauce which was SO good.   Our entrees included chicken panang curry and the chicken pad thai. We loved the panang curry. We ordered ours medium and it was quite hot for us but we enjoyed it! Our kids had the kids chicken fried rice. We tried theirs and it was great and the portion sizes were perfect for them. They loved it.   I ordered to-go as a walk-in customer and the gentleman up front was SUPER nice and helpful. He directed me to the entrees that were the most popular. He also offered me a 10% discount as a first time guest.   When I waited for my order, they kindly brought over some ice water for me and it was so nice for them to do that. Not many places do that nowadays, so that was a really sweet gesture.   We tried going there again today because the food was THAT good, but they were closed today. Such a bummer and I may need to tell them to stay open 7 days a week from now on.   Great food. We'll be back for sure!!!

This was my first time EVER trying Malnati's and I'll for sure be coming back. We were here today for a social media event, so we got a chance to sample quite a bit. We had their amazing deep dish pizza and tried half cheese and half classic and it was amazing. It was served super hot and we LOVED our butter crust!!   Our starter was the bruschetta which came highly recommended by our server. A delicious medley of tomatoes, parmesan, fresh basil, garlic and olive oil.   For dessert we sampled their tiramisu and the chocolate chip cookie pizza. We LOVED the cookie pizza and highly recommend it. A warm cookie prepared in a deep dish and served with vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream.   We are SO thrilled that Malnati's is joining the Phoenix food scene and look forward to coming here again!

Really pleased that Barros has moved into my neighborhood. They closed down the other one on Alma School and moved here. I've dined inside and ordered take-out from them. The place is super nice and they even have a kids corner off to the side. We typically order large pizzas and wings from them. The crust is a bit bready for my taste. I've even ordered thin crust and felt it was still a bit bready as well. We usually order from them when we throw large parties and they are usually right on time as far as my take out orders. I don't really have anything negative to say about them. Their customer service is great.

This Starbucks is brand new. Great customer service and my drink order has been correct each time. This place is a little on the small side.  They DO, however, have a nice patio out front which will be nice when the weather is cooler.
