I had the opportunity to go back here and I had a way better experience.  I used their new Mystic 2014 HD booth. I really liked the results. It left me with a super nice, even bronzed look. I would highly recommend going here to use this booth.

Regretting coming to this location they try to hassle you and it's super rude!!!! I wanted my matts cleaned and this small area in the back in between the mats. The guy tells me I can do that all for $39.99. Cone to find out to clean mats it's $1 a piece. Why would I pay $21 to have a small area to clean?!? After I changed my mind the detail guy told the girl to charge me $2 for my mats a piece when the ticket says $1 such crap!! Go to the Danny's on Happy Valley they are so much more professional there!

Poorly managed take your business elsewhere.  Last time we ordered they forgot our wings. I called and they said they would be on there way it took another hour for them to show up. When I called the manager they said next time we ordered they would take 50% off our order. Called tonight and of course that was socumneted in the system so that manager wouldn't honor it. I will take my business elsewhere.

I used to like coming here but my past couple of experiences have been awful so I'm not going back!!!! The guy who did my nails did an awful job they were lifting and he didn't even paint an even coat of clear gel they had streaks through them. Then the last time I had a pedicure the girl was rude and I basically had to argue with her to get what I wanted done. Then they also charged me $5 to take off my gel which they have never done before. I was a loyal customer who also spent $100 in gift cards the time I got my nails done. They don't know how to treat loyal customers. I suggest going to Krazy nails across the street that just opened.

I want to love this place but hate it because they have the worst service....if it's not waiting forever for your food than its waiting forever for a server to get you a drink!!!!! I have heard horror stories about upper management too!!!! I suggest spending your money somewhere else.

Gave this place another opportunity today because last time I expressed my concerns to a manager so she gave me a gift card. Another disappointment I had a diffrent manager approach me and ask me about my previous review on yelp and that is completely ok but he handle it so unprofessional to the point that I had to tell him that his approach was inappropriate. My husband and I were in complete shock in the way he handled it to the point we felt uncomfortable and left. Will never return here again.

Just used Atlasta Movers on Friday and they did an amazing job. We have moved 4 times in the past couple of years and this was by far the best moving company we have used. They helped pack my kitchen and did a wonderful job. They were very professional, efficient and affordable!!!!! I highly recommend them for doing your move!
