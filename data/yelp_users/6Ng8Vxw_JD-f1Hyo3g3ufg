Let me just say I love NYPD pizza!!! The big ziti was to die for the cheese the sauce the noodles he couldn't go wrong, my boyfriends out visiting from Florida so it was his first experience and he totally loved it also, it's almost like getting a little bit of the Big Apple in AZ! And when in doubt you can always have a personal pizza they come me to order and fresh as can be!!

I so love this place I can't come to Phoenix without hitting up Lo Lo's Chicken & Waffle!! The good is awesome how can you go wrong eating chicken with waffles you can't!! Everything on their menu is delicious from the shrimp & grits the traditional kool-aide served in mason jars you come once & you'll be hooked!!! The chicken is always deliciously fried never too greasy now the Kool-Aid can be a little bit sweet but I always have them add a little sierra mist to it that kind of dilutes it a little,  Now for the cornbread it's all warm fluffy & buttery what more could one ask for. If you've never had shrimp and grits this is definitely the place to try it! Plump juicy seven jumbo shrimp spread over buttery creamy grits with bacon cheese,  Green onion I believe they also have a little bit of Tabasco or some type of seasoning that gives it a nice little kick!  One of the best homegrown family restaurants I've ever eaten at from the small little house to three locations downtown on Central in Scottsdale and also located in the Phoenix airport anytime you visit Arizona especially Phoenix make sure you plan on making it a stop that you can't pass by go in and indulge in all of the deliciousness

I can't say this enough I love love love IKEA I could spend hours and hours going up-and-down and throughout the isles of this place,  doesn't matter if you're looking for kitchen where bedroom lamp shades desk desk chairs they have it all,  would you like me I like to build things and I don't like to use instructions I like to look at the box see how it supposed to look and then just put it together, not your type of person who doesn't like to put things together this wouldn't be an idea place for you unless you're looking for small household stuff, pricing is great and the quality is excellent I've never had any problems with anything I purchased here, thing is I wish that they would build one in Tucson so I would have to keep driving up to Phoenix.

I'm not really a gambler but I do like this hotel especially since the fact that they do have fat burger in the food court. My auntie comes here all the time and she seems to win a lot so I guess their games are pretty good.  I've gone to the nightclub here and I actually had a really good time great music super cool people, I would return. Not to mention the shopping outlets are right next-door great location.  Quick and easy and convenient being that it's right next to the interstate. Spacious rooms that were actually must be some proof because you can't hear all the excitement from the casino in your room.

It's that time year again the Caribbean carnival festival or you can get delicious treats music and people from across the Caribbean, even had a DJ my man come all the way from Florida to Grace everyone in AZ with his musical skills, DJ Lazzo had the upstairs bumping and straight from Trinidad and Tobago, he graced us with a nice sultry dance and music almost feels like you're right in the Caribbean, DJ Lazzo a nice wonderful Caribbean DJ for hire!!

Oh how I've missed the original sliders from living in New York I used to get this tiny delicious melt in your mouth mini burgers!! I was extremely happy to be vacationing in Vegas & see that there've finally arrived on the west coast!!!  Those who've written bad reviews obviously are those who probably eat at the Golden Arches & think that's good... From the smell & taste you can't go wrong here, with or without cheese love these little burgers!!!  If your not a beef person check out the chicken rings trust you'll leave satisfied!!! Love me some White Castle
