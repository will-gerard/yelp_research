I have been looking for genuine sliders since I moved from the East Coast to Phoenix. This place is THE PLACE! At the point that I found this little joint, I would have settled just for a Whitecastle or better yet, a Krystal's. However, Phoenix doesn't have either of those.   My mouth is watering even thinking of it. Not only are they the best sliders in town, but I'm fairly certain they're some of the best I think I have ever had. Always cooked fresh, you can tell they haven't been frozen and then pre-cooked for the day. They're made right then and there as you order.    The owner of this business is as good of a local business owner as one could hope to meet and absolutely embodies everything about this place. It's cozy, non-pretentious, and downright homie. He is always genuine and kid when I come in here. Though there are more "gourmet" type places for burgers in the valley, and those places are definitely good, this place is, hands down, my FAVORITE int he valley.   Think I'll head over right now!!

I love this little spot.  Decent local coffee spot. The raisin bran muffin is to die for. USUALLY pretty friendly, knowledgeable staff. Though I think I've walked in a couple times to an upset irritable manager? It happens. I get it. I too, work in the industry. I live on 7th ave and the ambience is just beautiful for the area... Keeps me coming back again and again and again.

The Clarendon Hotel is a great place to hang out all summer and winter long, even if you're not staying over night. Killer restaurants, awesome clientelle, always some good music on the rooftop and almost ALWAYS something to do. Its cozy, down to earth, eclectic, with a high fashion type risk and somewhere where anyone who is anyone loves to lounge by the pool for various events summer status. I recently won a one night stay, as it's been a hell of a year, and Ben Bethel is "just like the rest of us" trying to get by and help get by, I'm highly impressed. -Jess

Thank you to Massage Envy for finding and returning my list engagement ring and for a stellar 2 hour massage from Maribel. Brody from the front desk called me beaming when it was found. Regardless of some of the other issues with front desk people earlier in the day and the flighty responses to my inquiries, I am grateful that it has been found and I'm super relieved.

Okay so I'm not really a huge McDonald's fan but I come here a lot when I bring girls for mentoring. So as we are sitting and doing work out of a book on a Sunday night (paying customers) the girl that I'm mentoring is smoking her electronic cigarette (no scent and nothing harmful... even airports allow them), the manager literally YELLS across the restaurant "YOU CAN'T DO THAT" and is completely rude and unprofessional. I understand rules and don't mind abiding by them, but to be rude and brash? Unnecessary. Not to mention my burger was cold and there was no ketchup in the containers. The restaurant was practically empty and there was no line. I worked in the restaurant industry for years, I was absolutely disgusted. We won't be coming here to do work anymore. What a jerk?!?

All I can say about this place is PERFECT! I've been going to the Parlor since it opened and never once have I been disappointed in my food. It's just phenomenal. Aside from a sometimes long wait, it's worth every last penny :) yay!

So, Snooze, huh? First of all, as much as I love my mornings, I have an equal and dedicated love with the "snooze" button. So, immediately, all I can think is "I can relate..."!  The atmosphere is absolutely perfect. Adorable and authentic. Diverse and yet coordinated and well put together. The energy is consistent. As in, the host was as personable and upbeat as the server without overdoing it... Because let's be honest here, there's a line between authentic "radness" and "I'm full of shit and trying way too hard to be perky for a good tip" radness. And let's talk about how great it is, that although there's a wait, you can walk right in to a complimentary cup of their fresh brewed Guatemalan coffee!! Now, I like my coffee untainted by sugars and creamers and the verdict is clear... They clearly drink this stuff in heaven.  Our wait wasn't too painful. A little longer than I necessarily expected, given the size of the crowd. However, it being a new restaurant and such a pleasure to be inside of, the table turnover wasn't as quick as some other places in Phoenix, i.e. "Matts Big Breakfast", that keeps you coming back because the food is phenomenal, but is so small that once you're done eating, it's time to dash before you get a rash on your arm from rubbing elbows with the folks at the table next to yours.   Anyway, THE FOOD! Because it's all about the food, right?  Oh. My. God.  I am a true junkie when it comes to French Toast and it's the first thing I try everywhere I go for breakfast, if of course they offer it. Not only does "Snooze" offer it, but they offer TWO variations of it, which I'm not sure I have ever seen anywhere else before, aside from your chains like IHOP etc.  The "OMG French Toast", stuffed with marscapone and topped with cinnamon, strawberries, vanilla, and... Wait for it... Coconut!.. Which almost threw me off from ordering it, because I'm generally not a fan, but I went for it. And I'm so glad that I did!!!This stuff is appropriately named, because there are TRULY no other words. Absolutely fantastic.!! Now, unfortunately, my 5th star was lost because the food did take a little longer than I think it should ever take for food to come out and it was a little soggy as if it may have been sitting on the line a tad bit longer than it should've been. I'm not going to say it was cold, because it wasn't. However, it wasn't as warm as I would've liked for it to be. Again, all of this is still MINIMAL for a brand new place just getting it's feet on the ground.  Yes, I've applied for a serving position at this spot. But, to be fair, this review isn't ONLY because I'm hoping like hell that they will hire me, but because this is a WONDERFUL addition to Central Phoenix for breakfast and brunch. I will have to check out their lunch menu as well in order to post a review about that aspect, but overall, aside from Matt's which has been in my own humble opinion, the best breakfast ONLY joint in Phoenix for years and Windsor's breakfast/brunch on weekends, Snooze is quickly behind and I have a feeling, is going to DOMINATE the morning scene sooner than later.  Now it's time to head home and snooze... Saturday "after breakfast naptime".
