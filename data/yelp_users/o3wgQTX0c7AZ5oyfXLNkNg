If I could give this apartment complex 0 stars I would. They start off with being very friendly and show you all of the positive things this complex has to offer. This place is beautiful, the pool is lovely and the work out room is state of the art. However, do not let that sway you! The management is a bunch of money grubbing savages that will nickel and dime you for everything you have. I have never been more displeased with any complex as I have with San Montero! Do not rent here or even give them the time of day! They swindled me out of $250.00 just because I couldn't meet their ridiculous time lines...sorry I have a work schedule!

I first had this Thai food in flagstaff and was in love! I figured I would try this location and it did not disappoint!   The tofu is always cooked perfectly and I've heard the chicken is great too.  I usually get either the yellow curry or the pad thai. Both of them come in epic preportions and I have lunch for the next day. The tom kha soup is delicious!  Go for the lunch special, it's cheap and the portions are still huge.   The service is fast and you won't get stuck waiting for food for too long!

Terrible, horrible, no good, very bad service. I ordered two pieces of cheesecake to go at the counter and it took 35 minutes for them to ring up the order so I could leave and be on my merry way. It wasn't like there was a problem with the register, no it was the complete lack of attention from the staff. For 7.50 a slice of cheesecake you would think they would be more attentive! Will not be back. Too expensive and obviously they do not care about a customer.

This place is delicious!!!! Though I couldn't afford to go here everyday I absolutely love this place. Their Far East salad is fantastic and get an oatmeal cream pie to go! Service can be a bit slow but they are constantly bringing out dishes and it doesn't appear like anybody is just standing around.  Their food is well worth the wait!!!

This place is super laid back. It's not great for craft beers, quite the opposite really so if you're a beer snob you may as well go to the yucca tap room. I love this place because of the $.50 tables, the friendly staff and the cheap well drinks. This place is awesome to play pool at and I have never had a poor experience here.

My boyfriend and I visited this place based on the reviews. I was hesitant at first because of the lack of parking and the trailer park in the back but that should not deter you. We walked in and immediately were welcomed by the man at the cashier and the service was nothing but friendly. My boyfriend got the lengua burrito and said it was the best lengua he has ever had. However the show stopper was the chili rellenos burrito (vegetarian). It was absolutely to die for and was not too spicy but wasn't exactly tame either. We will be back over and over again. One of the best Mexican joints I have ever been to! (Even if it looks like a hole in the wall joint)

Let's just say that every time I make a trip to phoenix I must stop by Green! This place is positively fantastic. There is honestly nothing on this menu that has ever let me down. I especially love their black jack pita! Prices are a little higher than the college budget, however their customer service is nothing short of exceptional. This vegan/vegetarian joint has something for everyone in your party. Get there early because this place fills up fast and for good reason. See you next time Green!

I love this little gem in the heart of Gilbert. Just as a small heads up, if you do not like feta or capers this may want to be a place you avoid because they are on 80% of the food and they do not so substitutions. I ordered one of the shrimp dishes and it was awesome however they didn't clean the artichokes perfectly and I got a few chokes in the middle. The whole party I went with had awesome meals and the feta salad dressing is amazing!!! I am not a huge fan of dressing and I loved it. Most definitely will be back!

This place is a little taste of Italy in queen creek. Their portions are gigantic!!! My boyfriend and I split one meal and we were both stuffed. We got the scallop linguine with scallops and it was phenomenal! Being able to choose your own sauce really diversifies the meal and left us satisfied. The meal comes with a choice of soup or salad and I would highly recommend the tortellini soup. All in all I am extremely satisfied from this establishment!

This is my go to sushi place!  The service is always friendly and the sushi is phenomenal! I highly recommend this place to anybody. They also have an "I hate sushi" menu for friends that are not sushi fanatics.   The only criticism is that I wish the prices were cheaper. Expect an average of $11 a roll.

Very nice movie theatre. The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the bathrooms were a bit dirty, not rest stop dirty but not as clean as I wanted. Overall it's a great theatre with a friendly staff.

This was my first time coming here and I stumbled upon it after riding the light rail. The staff is incredibly friendly and made recommendations for what exactly to order. I settled on getting a cappuccino and they certainly did not disappoint! They did fun coffee art on top and the coffee itself was very strong! The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is really relaxing! I will definitely be back to explore more!

I went to this place for the first time tonight. Let me bring the hi lights in the beginning for your ease. The decor was beautiful! Very cozy and completely inviting. Also our server was fantastic!  Now on to my issue with this place: my god this place is expensive! I've been to multiple wine bars and my goodness this place is more pricy than most. Also they only had one Riesling for the pay by the glass section and it was $9 when I can get the bottle for $13 at world market. Small selection and overpriced, will not be back.

I used to love this place a lot, recently it seems to have gone downhill. However, they have a large selection of beer and their draft beer changes fairly regularly but they have something for everybody. They are a bit pricy but it really makes up for it in the selection. There is also trivia on Tuesday around 7. The seating is spaced out and there is outdoor seating however during the weekends it gets a bit packed so get there early!!

This place is absolutely fantastic! They have a large selection of craft beer and it is constantly changing! My boyfriend and I went here on a Sunday afternoon and they have what is called Sunday fun day where certain beers are only $6 for a pitcher; what a deal! Their food is great as well! I had the grilled cheese and the honey drizzle on it was a stroke of genius! Give this place a check in next time you're in the are you will not be let down!

Maybe I came here on an off day because I really do not understand how this place got such rave reviews. Greasy, very bland food.  The vegetables that were in my vegetable fried rice tasted like they came from a bag and had almost no taste.  The prices were decent but definitely not worth it because of the poor quality of the food.  Also, the inside of the restaurant had an unpleasant odor which was terribly off putting. No thanks.

Love love love this sushi place! The purple rice is a refreshing change and had more flavor! The rolls are delightful and surprisingly large compared to other places. The grab and go is convenient however the supply is limited so get there fast! Overall this place is a home run for me!

First time coming here and me and my boyfriend absolutely loved it! The atmosphere is positively beautiful and despite what other reviews said we had excellent service! Granted we didn't have the food but the beer is lovely and I definitely will be back!

The two star rating is because of the intimate setting that this lounge gives you. However in my option the cocktail selection is limited and the prices are way too high! I ordered a traditional sazerac and what I got was basically a glass of sugar. Will not be back, this place is a total bust. Will go to bitter and twisted instead, they actually know how to make a good cocktail!

This place has quality craft beers and bartenders that know how to pour a good beer.   The reason it did not get 5 stars is there is no shade for the outdoor seating which in the Arizona heat is quite unfortunate.  Other than that I would recommend the pretzel with beer cheese. It is large enough for two people or one if you're feeling quite hungry. The place is also clean and the staff has a good grip on beer knowledge.

Love this place! Their cocktails are fantastic. I am so excited to try more of their options because they have such a large variety. Their atmosphere is fantastic and very inviting. My one critique is that it does get very loud in here during the later hours of the evening. Enjoy this little gem in the heart of Phoenix!

The reason this place is getting 4 stars is because the food was quite good. The service is horrid! I went in at lunch time and the place was really full, luckily i just needed a table for 1 and I sat down without anybody greeting me or giving me a menu. After 5 minutes of no service I walked to the front and asked for a menu and once again waited. After 15 minutes somebody finally took my order and I waited patiently for some water. No joke 35 minutes later (the restaurant was practically empty by then) me food AND water arrived. This place is great but if you don't have at least an hour to wait for food go elsewhere.

I absolutely love this Thai place! It is consistently great and when I order for carry out the food is still piping hot when I get home. I usually get the yellow curry with fried tofu at a medium heat and it's just perfect. The pad Thai has this smokiness to it that tastes like a well seasoned wok and leaves me craving more. The price is fair considering the portion size is quite large. I would definitely recommend this place to anybody who likes thai!

Love this place! The portion seemed small at first however it really filled me up and there was enough sauce to coat all of the rice. My one issue is that the toppings scoops are a bit too small (got 4 pieces of edemame) and the wasabi portion was far too large for me. Other than that I will definitely be back!
