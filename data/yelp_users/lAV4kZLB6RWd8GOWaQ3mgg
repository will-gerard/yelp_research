#1 cool thing about Bucca is the family portions. Love that you can come in and serve the family out of central bowls of spaghetti. It's Almost as good as eating at home. Downside, they use processed white wheat when they make the food. If they used whole wheat, this restauant  would jump to 4 stars in my eyes.

Not a fan of Panda Express. I just don't like processed food. You can have fast food that's fresh, think Chipotle. Panda Express beats out a hamburger joint on a health scale, but it's not much better.

Ok. Health Scale goes out the window. We're Talking about dessert!  Custard is so much yummier than ice cream. If you've never had it it's time for a new experience. I love custard!

Ok. I'm very picky with food. Must People are picky about taste or texture.  Not me, I'm picky about quality. Bread is a particularly difficult one to understand from a quality perspective.  Enriched breads are linked to a condition known as leaky gut.  Basically that condition causes your gluten allergies.  conversely, whole wheat particularly sour dough has shown promissing benefits to gluten sensitivities.  In other words, the quality of your bread is critical to your digestive health.   I love the bread I buy here because its super high quality, made fresh, and the loaves I buy often cheaper than store bought.

This is one of the best places to do parkour.  I recommend this place for its various obstacles. This is a challenging place to work out. For families this is also a good park. The kids train and amusement park rides are neat and cost a small fee. You frequently see professional photos being taken here. Good for sports  activities. They even have a skate park and a large round area for meetings, like an old outdoor theatre set up.  However, I've never seen it used there. I've only seen it used for award ceremonies. Overall, this is a very multipurpose park.

I've never been in a gamestop with rude staff. I don't know how they find these teenagers, but gamestop has some of the friendliest staff on the planet. Furthermore I'm very impressed with their knowledge. They must have an excellent staff training program.

Wow, just love this place. Going camping, hunting, kayaking this is your place. Being a land locked surfer, I'm stocked they have stand-up paddle boards.

K. I'm not a fan of the neg, but coldstones is my least favorite kind of icecream. Some people love it. I don't know what it is about the ingredients. But it didn't taste right to me. Maybe because I'm do used to real foods.

#AJs Fine Foods is an excellent source for your vegan whole foods. I was shocked that it wasn't near as expensive as everyone said. On par with whole foods.

You know I'm not a fan of the basic burger joint.  They would typically get 1 star from me.  However D&B have some fresh food. The problem I have with the fresh food is how its bombarded with the less healthy stuff.  Course if you're looking for a burger joint, this is your place.

Ok. First of all I like sushi. I learned to make sushi from a sushi chef while living in Japan. I'm picky about sushi.  Love this restaurant.  As you may know, I rate food based on how close it is to a Raw vegan diet. That said, #Ra is raw, the food is fresh. There is very little that is unhealthy, so they get a 4 star from me for healthy fresh food! Love this place!

O.K. So I have my own health scale. Raw Vegan would be at the top followed by Real Fresh Food.  In the middle of my scale is Gym Rat.  I'd place the University of Phoenix Cafe between Gym Rat and Real Fresh Food. Why? Because that's the kind of food they offer.  So if you're looking for raw vegan, you're out of luck. However, if you're looking for sometimes fresh and sometimes vitamins produced in a lab..this is your place.  No value statement here. The food tastes good, its not that loud, and you can walk in whether you have anything to do with U of Px or not.   Make the trip and enjoy the experience. P.S. They have fresh sushi!

Absolutely love this place. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  You may be aware that I have a health scale that I use to rate eateries.  For me its all about how healthy it is. Coming in at 5 stars would be an almost 100% raw vegan restaurant. 4 starts would be any place with actual fresh food.  Therefore, paradise bakery is a 4.5.         Now for something not so healthy...insanely good, homemade quality cookies.

Ok, rating a desert place based on health expectations is a but rough. However Blue Ocean is my favorite desert place to go for date night.  Frozen yogurt is healthy. I can't quite call it raw or fresh, so I'm down to 3 stars. But it's better than gym rat food-vitamin based. So back up to 4 stars. Don't get me wrong, if you want a guilt free desert, this is the best place. Unless you plan to have fruit as desert in life (like the Japanese) I'm going to say that this is your next best choice.

Sadly, they're out of business everyone.  The new yogurt place around the corner is almost as good.

Tons of healthy food.  And don't tell me its pricey if you'll buy a $10 burger at a fast food joint.  I love all of the fresh food! Great for the raw vegan or just someone who wants actual food, you know the kind you don't create with a laboratory.  Excellent. Like AJ's or whole foods but cheaper.

Ok, my coveted 4 stars for being a fresh restaraunt. I life Thai food. If you have a passion for real, fresh food and have never tried Thai, you're missing out. If you've had Thai, you'll love this place. Small, but always full. They actually use a grandma's secret family recipes.  Really.

Love the cranberry sause and turkey sandwich. That said, I've got to be true to my health scale. 2 stars for being just better than a mickey Ds. Change all the sandwich bread to 100% whole wheat and give more vegan options or use free range meat and this would jump to a 4 or 5 start place. That said, I'm starting to get hungry for the cranberry sause now.

For those who know me I detest burger joints.  I have a scale by which I rate restaurants. Burger joints are at the 1 start end. Most unhealthy as you can get. Watch out for corn feed beef!

I recommend the b-12 shots for anyone in chronic pain.  B12 shots have helped my wife periodically over the years to cope with her chronic pain.  I'm no doctor, but I know a good pain relief when I see it. Glad we have a place in the valley that offers these shots.

Love all the beans and veggies.  The food type in general is healthy. It is delicious.  But it's not the highest quality.  The service is a little lower than average.  We ordered a meal and it came out to be significantly less than we expected.  When we asked them why it was so sub par they just said that was the price.  We were just surprised they weren't accommodating or at least embarrassed to serve something with only 2 ingredients.  So we sent it back.  The saving grace is the dips.  Best bean dip,  best salsa.  So definitely start the meal with the free chips and dip.
