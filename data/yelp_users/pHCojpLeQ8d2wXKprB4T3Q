Being a vegetarian, I was a little hesitant to go here without being able to see a menu first. The place turned out to be very nice inside. We told the server we hadn't been there before and weren't sure what we could order without meat. She was very nice and pointed out several options. She brought out 6 side dishes and let us know only the kimche had fish oil. We got the tofu and mushroom soup made with water broth and a rice bowl with tofu instead of beef. She left sauce at the table so we could make it as spicy as we wanted. We loved everything! The Hite and OB beers paired great with the meal. On the way out, we saw a couple other veggie options that looked great too. The verdict, vegetarians go and eat with abandon!

$33 for two crumbly soft tacos filled with rice and beans, a tablespoon of guacamole, and a Jose cuervo margarita. If you ever go to a tequileria that only serves Jose Cuervo, just get up and leave. The rest of the menu is probably awful too.

I was going to meet a friend for lunch at Barrio (one of the only places you can get "real" Mexican in Phoenix, which I could never understand -  we are less than 4 hours from the border!!). Unfortunately, it was before I yelped much, so I neglected to notice that they were closed Mondays:( Dejected, we drove down the street looking for someplace else to go. I can't remember if it was the Catrina that drove us in, but as soon as I saw the salsa bar, I knew I was in heaven. It was like actual food that I've actually eaten in Mexico (rather than assorted patterns of tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese). Now we take all visiting friends and family to this place. A visitor from LA said they were the best tacos he had ever eaten and I'm sure he wasn't lying.   Many people have commented on the salsa bar. My favorites are the creamy ones (pecan, peanut, and cilantro) and most of all the sesame (to me, the spiciest one on the bar), and usually I try to sample some of each one - but taste is in the eye of the beholder. The important point is that you don't want to fill up on the chips, because you will be sad when your huge plate of food comes. So I'd like to share my strategies for maximizing the salsa enjoying experience without getting uncomfortably full.  I start by limiting myself to 5-6 chips which I break into smaller pieces for dipping. Once the food comes, I take the second tortilla from each of my veggie tacos (the tacos themselves already have just the perfect type and amount, so it's pointless to try and add more) and use it to scoop up the salsa. With only the one remaining tortilla, you do get some drippage, but you can add more salsa to any veggies and cheese that fall out and eat it with a spoon. Then for dessert, I pour the cilantro salsa on my rice. Mmmm, salsa. I would buy this stuff by the tub if they would let me. BTW, I asked - they just laughed.   The only draw back is that my poor husband tries to order a margarita every time we go, and they still don't have any. I hope someday they will take his advice and add it to the menu.

Vegetarians not welcome.   We used to go to Havana when it was in this location. It was my favorite restaurant - just thinking about the berenjena con garbanzos still makes my mouth water. We live nearby so thought we'd give the new place a chance. We went in and looked at the menu with the hostess watching us like a hawk. Disappointed, I asked "do you have anything vegetarian things on the menu?" (for some reason beyond my comprehension, some restaurants like to keep this a secret).  She said to me, "we don't do vegetarian here."   I just looked at the new menu and they now have cheese enchiladas. WOW, thanks for throwing us a bone.

We switched to bluesy about a year ago and have had no complaints. It's easy to find, clean and safe, and they always honor their discounts. The drivers are always nice and helpful. Bill C was very friendly, got us to the airport safely and quickly, even asked which door we preferred.

Most of the vendors didn't seem to get the concept. At food festivals, you need to have small samples that are prepared in advance (to avoid huge lines) and appropriately priced so that people can try several things. Otherwise, you might as well just go to a restaurant. Before I bought tickets, it seemed like there would be a lot more vegetarian food. Finally we found a Cajun truck with veggie jambalaya listed on the menu. We ordered it and they said they didn't have it. We said it was on the sign and so they made it for us. Then they charged us $2 more than the price on the sign, saying it was a special price for the event. So you have to pay for admission and then get upcharged to eat it in the field? I don't think that's how it's supposed to work.   When we left around 2, there was a huge line to get out of the parking lot and some very aggressive drivers. One angry drunk guy jumped out of the passenger side of a car and stood in front of an SUV that he felt cut him off (the SUV was actually there first). The SUV wasn't having it and drove ahead pushing the guy back - right in front of a police officer who appeared to call someone on his radio, but nothing ever came of it. Pretty scary, I probably won't go back to this venue.

They have amazing vegetarian Mexican food. I would call it Mexican nouveau rather than authentic Mexican. Way more interesting than the beans/rice/cheese places you typically find in the Phoenix area. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very receptive to suggestions and imaginative with the drinks.

All the food was great (lots of vegetarian options!) and the server was very friendly. Only draw back is no wine.
