WOW!! What an amazing establishment.  I had the pleasure of sitting downstairs, as I entered through the kitchen.  This is my second time dining here, and since I entered this way the first time, I ended up doing it again. The martinis are absolutly amazing and the food is spectacular.  I had a dirty martini with amazing blue cheese stuffed olives, shaken violently, with that frothy layer of ice on top - outstanding.  Then I ordered up the enchiladas and tamales - which came with both red and green sauce.  Let me warn you the red sauce is NO JOKE! WHOA! Hot, but super yummy.  Everything was prepared perfectly and I could not be happier.  My date had the sliders and scallops - I don't think I have had a better prepared scallop.  The service is perfect, staff is happy, food is amazing and I will dine there again!

Dirty, gross, not fun at all. I love a good cowboy just like the next woman - but the night I went it was filled with a bunch of kids with no shoes on, walking around on the grossest carpet I have ever seen - why a bar would have carpet is beyond me.  Gross!

Now I know what everyone thinks, "This is a chair restaurant, why are you bothering with a review?"  Well, two reasons, one they have amazing service and two - I ate the MOST outstanding burger since I moved to AZ.  I arrived at 6:30 - waiting patiently for my 2 friends who were leaving the country for good, a little goodbye party.   My waitress was the sweetest person I had met and she really cared about her job and the tables she was dealing with.  I couldn't help but love her.  I ordered food and drink off the Happy Hour Menu - and let me stop here to explain this amazing situation: $5 food, martinis and wine - ARE YOU SERIOUS?  (as a heart attack) Anyway I was still waiting on my very late friends and wanted to stick in their 2 drinks before happy hour ended - and the lovely waitress ordered them, but waited to bring them, because she doesn't want them to have warm drinks - Can you believe this amazing service?  Lets move into the Burger, with peppered bacon and cheddar cheese.  Huge onion ring, and a little wedge for my burger.  I have no clue what sauce was served, but it was outstanding too.  I scarfed half the burger and could barely save the second half for my BFF (who still wasn't there).  The BBQ Shrimp, Calamari and Ahi Tuna all were amazing and I cannot rave enough.   I really appreciate staff and the restaurants they work at that go that extra mile.  They easily could have made me pay full price for the additional 2 beverages, but they didn't and its those little gifts that earn a review like this and a pat on the back!!

This lovely gem has some of the best biscuits I have seen outside of the deep south.  Buttery, rich, fluffy amazing warm biscuits.  They have this house made raspberry preserves that will make you swoon!  I had Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs on top.  Three layers of crunch corn shells were smothered in creamy refried beans with fresh pico and sour cream. The whole dish was dreamy and I could not wait to have more.    My dining partner ordered pancakes.  WHOA!  They were amazingly moist inside, like cake, but the outside was perfectly crisp.  They must use a really hot griddle - which is key in pancake making.    The service is great, the decor is adorable.  The restaurant is small with a lovely outdoor dining area - which is heaven in the winter.   I recommend trying this lovely place.

Oh dear does this jack off of a place deserve a whole star? Ahh NO!  As most people can see I rarely leave a crappy review.  I try to leave the most positive feedback as the world seems miserable enough without additional negative feedback online.    Friday night, had a cocktail at AZ88 with a great experience and met a few people that were headed over to Kazimierz.  I have been here before, when I used to vacation here (I now live here) and I remember vaguely not being overly happy.  Now I know I hate this place.    First of all the place is way too dark, light some more candles, turn up a light or two, do something.  Next well over 60% of the wines on their "Wine List" they don't have.  Imagine that.  I remember this happening the last time, years ago.  Funny how I forgot.    Next the place is hidden behind other restaurants and you have to search for it and there is no actual sign, just some stupid riddle.    Lets go back to Friday night, apparently they had a band. So they thinks they deserve a cover charge for the band, that isn't really good anyway.  So 2 people @ $5.00, spent at door.  Only to walk in and find the same dark space, crappy band, and no WINE!!!  Needless to say I had to settle for warm crap wine only to have the bartenders be rude and combative.    I attend a lot of fine establishments here in Scottsdale and it seems that when you head down to any place in Old Towne, you end up with rude, young, inexperienced staff and this is a fine collection of that.  Then to add cover to crappy service, really irritates me.    Worry not, Kazimierz will surely be out of business soon with this level of service and stock of wine.

Finally someone in Scottsdale that knows how to make Hummus the right way. When you live in Dearborn MI where all the Arabic people live - you get spoiled. I know good Hummus and this is it! During happy hour its free!!

I had the opportunity to dine in this lovely establishment last night and it was amazing. I was greeted by a lovely bartender when I walked in and he whipped up some great beverages. Lets not mention how one of my friends was clumsy enough to spill an entire beverage and drench my dress in Gin.  Once seated I ordered the Fresh pasta with Bolognese sauce. I must admit - I do not think I have ever tasted something so fresh. The meat was super tender,just the right spice and sweetness to the tomatoes. Outstanding will be my word of choice to describe this dish.   My friend ordered the risotto with calamari, squid, and scallops. This dish was overloaded with seafood, so tender and happy. Oh My!!  My other friend ordered the fresh house made cheese Ravioli which was all made fresh in house. I can see now, the little old adorable Italian mothers hand stuffing pasta pillows with cheese - oh my mouth waters just to reminisce.   All three dishes were beyond amazing. I don't think I have had Italian this good in years.  PLEASE go and taste the beauty of real authentic Italian - the way it should be made.

Everytime I go to AZ88 - I am always happier.  Lets start with the Aviation martini - made with Noblets Gin, Luxardo and Creme de Violet - shaken, straight up - it is by FAR the most amazing cocktail I have ever feasted on!  The bartenders and staff are always warm, friendly and make perfect martinis.  They always manage to fill it all the way to the rim, without wasting a drop! How they always do that in every drink, is beyond me.  I don't see them measure, which will ruin a drink anyway.  Drink making is an art, that must be felt.  They nail drinks here.  Food - amazing.  From simple chips to salads to the amazing chicken sandwich I ate, I can't find one bad thing to say about them   The decor in the lovely place is stark and white and very contemporary. Perfect for the artsy district they reside in. Keep up the great job!

Did you know that the Capital Grill is doing their Generous Pour for the summer?  Me either!! I found out quickly enough though!   So first let me say - I was lucky enough to be seated in the section of the most amazing waitress I have had the pleasure of dining with in many years! Her name is Sharon - and if you are making a reservation - I would ask for her - because she turned a mediocre night for me into an Outstanding night.  Her personality and passion for what she does shines in every word she uses. I was intrigued and in awe from the first second!!  We ordered the wines - yes ALL of them! We drank well over our fair  share - and loved every second.  Let me describe dessert - Coconut Cream Pie - OH MY!!! Dreamy, decadent and a perfect ending to my feast.  I started with Beef Carpaccio - which was perfect. The simplicity of this dish was amazing.  Then I had the Swordfish - which was prepared perfectly. Most restaurants tend to over do this dish - but Capital Grill nailed it!  After all of my indulging, I was leaving and could not help but tell everyone, including Sharon what a treat she was.   The funny part is - she actually took the time to send me a thank you card in the mail. When was the last time anyone took that kind of time, in today's world?   I can't wait to go back and see Sharon again and of course have yummy food!!!

This lovely establishment is located inside the Crystals Mall - with a sexy hip kind of feel.  The bar is inviting and the food is great.  To start - it was Happy Hour - yes Happy Hour on the strip in Las Vegas - WOW! That just happened.    So I stroll in and order amazing Sakitini's and followed by cold sake - which was on happy hour for an amazing price.    Let me first tell you all about the Angry Tuna Roll.  First I hate Las Vegas, and I only go when I have a convention and I always come back sick!  So naturally I am a little angry while being there.  So when I saw Angry Tuna Roll - it became an instant HIT!  The flavor was amazing, tuna prepared perfectly and the avocado was still cold, even though this roll was fried.  The spice from the jalapeno and sweet sauce on top was amazing.  A great mixture of sweet and spice.   Then I ordered some Miso Ramen, which seems simple enough.  They flavored it perfectly, added vegetables and a poached egg, which made the flavor more intense with the yoke.  They really made the poached egg perfectly, which is no easy task.   In addition to great food, the service was outstanding.  As it turns out a new guy waited on us the first time and he had the most amazing energy and the next day I came back to dine again and to compliment the guy from the previous day.  I found out he was new, and he just had passion and drive.  Something so many restaurants lack on the Strip of Vegas.

Love this place. They have an awesome martini with St. Germain and Gin - love it! I also love the flatbread pizza and the wine list. The bar is large and friendly and you can always feel the warm breeze from the door - I love places that leave the doors open!  I loved this place years ago when I used to vacation here, now I live here and can go whenever I want! YAY!

Lets start with dessert - best I have ever tasted. I had the Butter Cake - which is served with a huge VAT of fresh whipped cream- wow! Second the cake is warm and moist and salty - yes SALTY! Surrounded with strawberries and orange slices - this dessert surely made me smile.  The live music was amazing! I rocked out all night to a lovely mix of great tunes! The martinis were cold and awesome, the crab cocktail was superb and the Blackened Salmon from the Columbia River was perfect.   Overall a pretty good experience. I will certainly go again.   I was purposely not going here because they don't do a happy hour - but I was drug there by a date (I know, poor me...lol) and have since become a fan!

This place is very small and inviting. I had to wait for a little while for my table, but it was worth the wait. The Sea Scallops were amazing on the appetizer menu and I had the BEST Bolognase with HOMEMADE Fettuccine pasta - They actually made the pasta in house.  Wine list was great too - good mix. I will become a regular here for sure!

Do I have to give them a whole star? This place is awful - the sad part there are so many of them around. I can't understand what people see in this place.  They have broken and ruined so many buttons on shirts with no ability to repair them.  Recently I brought this button issue to their attention on a dress of mine. They said they would replace the buttons.  When I got the dress back they replaced about 5 of the 20 buttons and they didn't match = and yes some idiot let this garment leave the facility.  Basically they make mistakes, try a half-assed attempt at fixing it and screw that up too.  I ask for creased pants - that I might get 50% of the time. I keep giving them another chance - but after 10 chances - this place just needs to buy a vowel or solve the puzzle.  Worst part - they are overpriced - way overpriced.  Clearly you can't fix stupid when it comes to this place.

This little dance bar has the best name ever - Dirty Pretty! Love it! The decor is awesome and the DJ is top notch. I rocked it out all night with awesome martinis and excellent tunes!  The dance floor is just large enough to accommodate and there aren't alot of meathead bouncers all over the place to annoy you.  Great place, great music and good times!

I dined at this amazing place on Sunday the last day of Restaurant Week - AZ. They put together an amazing menu that was really worth the cost.  Started with Miso Soup - perfect! Second had the Ahi Poke - which was prepared on these little triangles of what seemed like a soft corn tortilla. I could not figure out exactly what it was - and doesn't matter - all I know was Yummo! Next course was Sea Bass - prepared to perfection. Not too much flavor as to distract - but just enough.  Last was the roll dessert - with cream, berries and a sweet rice - I was in heaven.  All that and an amazing bottle of wine that was half off - sitting outside under the misters at a nice 90 degrees - in Beautiful AZ - who could ask for more?

Awful service. This place is owned and run by some crazy corporate people that have never been in the service industry. This is a classy place that was too cheap to finish the flooring and kept the concrete. They have decent happy hour but the drinks were warm and not good. They have a Ketel One Cosmo on the menu - that uses only Ketel One Citron - I asked for regular Ketel One and I could not have it on the Happy Hour price because some outside accounting firm measures all of their alcohol shots - WTF? Keep up the good work guys - I will NEVER be back.  I should have fetched the manager, took him to Stone Rose across the hotel and showed him what is place could look like. Stone Rose has NO happy hour and $14 drinks - PACKED! Bourbon Steak - $7 drinks empty - any reason why that is? Idiots!

I stopped in to this fine establishment for the first time since I have lived in Scottsdale and it was awesome. I have eaten at other J Alexanders before - and was always a fan - but this one rocked.  I had the Steak Kebobs - and they are amazing. Perfectly seared and medium - pink yumminess. The cocktails were flowing and I had an awesome time.  The people around me were all super social and even though I was dining alone at the bar - I met new friends fast.

This lovely restaurant will make you smile. The service here is outstanding, the food is amazing and the beverage service perfect.  People welcome you when you come in, the bar is very inviting and Eddie, the bartender is quite the character. He really makes precise and perfect cocktails and I like it here.  I had the hummus and chicken - simple dish that was made extraordinary.   I will dine in this great establishment as often as I can.

I have to use one star?  I used to be a regular customer at Calistro California Bistro. We discovered this place one day because we wanted a new happy hour place. I love flatbreads and this place had (key word had) awesome flatbread.  Things have recently changed here and the flatbread is no longer made in house and it's not very good. It is plain and not nearly as flavorful as the previous version.   The service used to be awesome but now it isn't.  Maybe they just didn't want me to be a regular customer anymore. Who knows?  One night I ordered a burger that was not prepared to my liking. Simple fix = make a new one. Instead they cooked the existing one more and over cooked it. Any chef knows this will happen. Laziness always prevails.   The best part is the manager passively aggressively said "My burger was prepared the right way" (as if I was the problem).  So I passively aggressively posted this review.  Then the manager offers to make another one. I have already waited about 45 minutes at this point - why not continue to wait? Clearly I have nothing better to do. So I reluctantly agreed because I actually liked coming there. So after another 30 minutes I am presented with a burger.  It was the way I asked for it to be, the FIRST two times.  But I'm still not happy and since I had waited so long I wasn't even hungry anymore.  I could have gone to another restaurant, ordered and eaten by this point.   My question is who accommodates me for all of the time wasted waiting for food that should have been prepared the right way the first 2 times I asked?  Calistro actually charged me for my burger, never once gave me a reason to come back, no apology for their gross inadequacies and laziness in the kitchen. Nothing.  Every other successful restaurant tries to make immediate amends while the customer is there. There should never be an instance where management should indicate to someone - that they are the problem, not the food preparation.   When that customer leaves and you do nothing this is what you end up with. Bad reviews.  Take advice from the marketing gurus at Starbucks. You have a bad experience and the next drink is on them. Coupon in hand when you leave. No choice but to come back and how quickly do we forget the bad time.   The restaurant is in a tough location, they aren't very busy whenever I'm there. I would think they would want to keep regular customers (2-3 times a week) happy.  But I guess they really don't want me dining there anyway. I take service like this personally.

This place is a hidden little jewel that apparently only locals know about. Since I am now a "local" I know too. Amazing is the only word I can think of. All fresh ingredient and made with love. I had the house made Margarita with no refined sugar at all. Just Tequila and fresh citrus. That's it! Then leeks with fresh mozzarella, bread crumbs and egg on top. Also rock shrimp, razor clams and cheese plate. Wow!  So European and yummy.

What a great name, awesome energy and amazing staff.  Now let me preface this with I live in North Scottsdale, so as many Arizonians know, we are stuck in a bubble up here.  That being said, since I have only been here 2 years, I have never driven so far south.  I thought i was in Tuscon.  I had no idea there were two 202 freeways..... you, I drove to the furthest one. But the drive, and getting lost was worth the wait to dine in this great place. Let start with the Skinny Cocktail list.... yes skinny.  Everything was low in sugar or had none and all bursting with flavor.  I loved it! We moved in to the Cheese Board which came with crusty bread, almonds and fruit. We also ordered the Bavarian Pretzel, with warm brie, and three mustard's.   I love mustard more than anything!  This fine establishment had awesome service, we sat at the bar and could not think of one bad aspect, except the old guy in a V-Neck Affliction shirt, but maybe he drove in from Scottsdale too.

The first time I strolled into this lovely place - I was blown away. People here are so friendly and inviting and I cannot get enough of it.  Iruna has the best Sangria of all time. Most restaurants add soda to Sangria - it should never be made that way but Iruna does not - they actually know what they are doing.  Food - One Word - AMAZING! I had so many dishes here - happy hour boasts lots of discounts. I ended up sharing with other people at the bar - everyone is very inviting and almost like family.  Highly recommended.

I am officially a regular here. I adore this place and all of the people in it. On the weekends you get the true Greek experience with music and dancing and even a belly dancer. Amazing. I have had almost everything on the menu and everything is perfect. I would not change a thing. Some of the BEST Martinis in the city have also come out of here. The Bartender used to work at Blue Martini so he is really good at the craft of martinis. Go here - eat, drink and be happy - this place breeds happiness and culture!

Oh dear I just had the most amazing pumpkin filled, hand made pockets of love - called ravioli. How did something like this happen?  I'll tell you - Lots of love from the chef at this lovely establishment.   My friend invited me out when he discovered they had fresh pumpkin related anything. So I raced over to see a beautiful bowl of hand made pasta pockets filled with the creamiest most amazing pumpkin yumminess that I have ever eaten. It had fresh fried sage leaves and an amazing sage and nutmeg butter. Parmesan cheese on top. Heaven in a bowl. Wow!!!   My cocktail was freshly muddled cucumbers and lemon with my favorite Hendricks gin.  Life cannot get much better than this moment.   The bartenders were extremely attentive and I was extremely pleased with the energy that flowed around the whole restaurant.   I will definitely dine again!!

I finally broke down and saw my first movie at the famous IPic Theater.  I saw the Bourne Legacy - which was an amazing action packed movie.  My seats were selected by one of the managers in the establishment, as I indicated I had never been, but frequent the bar quite often.  I had no idea what this experience was to hold, but when I walked into my auditorium I was thrilled.  The theater was large, and there was plenty of space between you and the people around you.  I was directed to my seat by staff and sat down to a cloud of a seat that you just sink into.  The chairs recline and you have a pillow and a blanket - are you kidding me? It was a little slice of heaven.  The staff will bring you whatever you want to eat and drink.  The theater was a comfy temperature and the sound system in this place is amazing.  Let's just say when someone shoots a gun in the movie, you feel it. Wow! I am really excited I was able to have this experience.  I recommend that everyone try this at least once, it will change how you view movies from now on.    Thank you IPic for ruining every other movie theater on the planet.

I have been here twice and I'm not sure if the fake Scottsdale people annoy me more or less than the fake staff. I ordered Halibut which I stressed to the waiter I hate it overdone. And indeed it was overdone. The drinks are light pours and overpriced but someone has to pay for the awesome door and decor.

I stopped in on a Friday night because a friend of mine wanted to go here. While this establishment is full of dating couples, match.com people and just out for a night, I decide to order the Pizza Sauce Bloody Mary. I have seen this made before and it is a beautiful beverage. In the menu the description says house cucumber lime vodka or Chinaco Silver Estate Tequila ( which would be a Bloody Maria I think), salt and pepper rim, Antipasti skewer and celery bitters. We all know Bloody Mary's come with celery and olives. I was served olives and a normal Bloody Mary mix, as apparently Tanzy ran out of supplies. The drink is not pretty like I have seen before and when I address the situation the bartender said "we are out of everything, we got slammed on Sunday." Are you effin kidding me? It's Friday. You mean to tell me in five days time nobody could make it to a store or get a delivery? My level of disappointment is shocking. I dine in almost every restaurant in this area. The Scottsdale Quarter is very trendy, relatively expensive and has the ability to host so many people. Having said that, to give such a lame excuse for a patron bringing up a poorly made beverage is sad. Being that Scottsdale insists on charging $10.00 for a Bloody Mary, I expect a sexy beverage that I have seen in the past. Consistency is key in this industry. When you wonder why Eddie V's is alive well  it's because they try very hard to have a great guest experience. Good thing you guys have IPic money to support you.

I went here for the first time on a Sunday to discover they do not have a Happy Hour on Sunday. That was confusing especially when it was empty.  Great staff and the drinks were awesome. I had the Hummus - which was amazing, made from a white bean instead of chick peas. It had truffle oil and yummy cheese crisps. I was happy. The decor was nice and a great location.  I hope they do well!

This place has the best hummus ever!!!  I love it. The make it with truffle oil and Cannellini Beans.It gives the dish a really creamy texture that is sure to please. It comes with little Parmesan toasts, and the new summer menu will have fresh cucumbers with it - which gives it a whole new dimension.   The Lemon Tree is a pretty awesome cocktail on the Happy Hour menu - nothing says "love" like half off drinks!  Try the happy hour weekdays only and get it half off appetizers and cocktails.

I love it here. It has a really unique name and I had the best time.  Went here on the first day of Restaurant week - and I had several dishes.  Started with the chop salad which had a very unique flavor, crunch and dried corn. It was interesting.  Moved into Halibut and dessert - all was awesome.  I sat at the bar and had an awesome time. The service was great and I will visit again.

I wrote this review after I moved into the area, and thought I should give it an update.  I frequent this establishment on a regular basis and the service and cocktails are amazing.  The bartenders are very friendly and even take the time to bring water with fancy things in it like cucumbers and fresh basil leaves.  Just going that extra mile really provides a nice guest experience.  These things do not go unnoticed by me for sure.  The food is just as wonderful. They have amazing fresh mozzarella sticks with a lovely marinara dip.  Their salads and pizzas are well prepared also. Cocktails flow and we are always well taken care of here.

This lovely establishment is located in the trendy Scottsdale Quarter. They have half off valet - which is great because the parking is awful. The filets are amazing here, and the Lobster Tacos are a must have. If you like seafood - get the Halibut when its served - you will not be disappointed.  The staff and service is great. This restaurant had live jazz bands and a nice ambiance.  Try not to look around too much while at the bar, all of the plastic surgery (typical for Scottsdale) will make you ask the question "What happen to your face?" I have never seen so much Botox, lip plumping, no expressions on your face, fake boobs, fake tans, and awful extensions in all my life. Who are the doctors performing these surgeries? The nose jobs alone will frighten Michael Jackson's surgeon.  And then of course the guy in the really cute shirt - you wish you could compliment, and can't help but say "Nice shirt, too bad it wasn't in your size" Officially the most pretentious place in Scottsdale - but the food is so good and consistent - I have to keep coming back.

I have to revamp my review of this lovely establishment. This restaurant has blown me away with the best service and food I could possibly ask for. That is really saying a lot because I am pretty demanding at times.   Lets start with Steve - the most amazing bartender I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He always puts a huge smile on my face and goes far above and beyond to make my experience at Eddie V's perfect. He always knows what I like to drink, makes my martini's perfect every time and when my beverage gets a little warm - he changes my glass - OMG I love him!  You know when you just finished eating and your beverage has been untouched while you eat - and the second I go to drink it again - Steve is swapping glasses for a cold one.  In addition, the management actually ordered Creme de Violet for me because I love it w/Hendricks Gin. I feel overwhelmed with love.   Moving on to the fares - WOW! Best filet I have EVER had - and I have had a few. The cut is always perfect, the temperature is always perfect and they sear the outside until crisp - whoa baby! The simplest dish - roasted corn - tastes like heaven too. Who would think corn could be so sweet and crisp? They rock it.  Lobster tacos - need I say more? I think not!! Amazing!  I really hope this place stays in business forever and I will eat here as long as I can. This is a jewel in the city of Scottsdale where most restaurants don't care if you are happy.   Keep up the good work Eddie V's.

BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!! - I have written other reviews for this lovely establishment, and sometimes, after a series of amazing meals and cocktails here, I feel like I need to write something new.  If you live in AZ, or visit AZ, if you do not try this wonderful restaurant, you are missing out on the finest dining experience I have ever had.  To some, that may not seem like a bold statement, however, I travel and dine at a lot of restaurants.  I have experienced some of the finest restaurants and cuisine in the world, and Eddie V's has raised the bar so high, there are only a handful of places that you can compare them to.    Typically I dine in the V Lounge, and on weekends, this bar is so busy, people are standing three deep drinking and enjoying the music and atmosphere.  The service at the bar has recently exceeded even my expectations.  I am sure finding good bartenders is a tedious task, but currently they have "nailed it".  Eddie V's has always had a couple of strong bartenders, but they currently have three really strong, amazing bartenders, and one fantastic bar back.  Together they do not miss a beat.  No matter how busy they get, they are all fun, personable and provide excellent service.    Eddie V's latest addition to the bar staff, was a shock to me, but has proven himself to be a stellar performer.  When I first met him, I was skeptical, as I am typically accustomed to Steve making my perfect cocktail.  The day I met this new bartender, whose name is Mike, I had a really rough day, and did not feel like training someone to craft my beverage.  Much to my apprehension, Mike crafted a perfect beverage.  I later learned, he was actually a paramedic by profession, and during the particular visit, I had a headache.  Mike asked if he could show me something to relieve it, again skeptical, but intrigued.  Mike came around, held a few pressure points in my poor aching head, and about 2 minutes later, headache was gone.  In addition to perfect cocktails and perfect food, I was given the opportunity to meet someone that I hope will remain with Eddie V's for years to come.  I believe he truly is an asset to this team.   I have entertained multiple vendors, friends and employees in the V Bar, and Mike makes everyone of them feel like a "regular" customer.  Mike is always happy, always smiling, always fun and never seems to get stressed or bothered by anything around him, and I always leave feeling like I am the most important person in the world.  Mike just has an innate ability to transfer his amazing, positive energy to the entire room.   If you have never had the pleasure of having a bartender that you immediately feel like they are your friend, then please stop and meet Mike. He would love to welcome you!

This place has some great music, awesome buffalo wings and excellent drinks - cheap! I have never had drinks made so well and been so inexpensive. The staff is awesome and this place is great. They have a full dance floor, plenty of pool tables and good times all the way around. Check it out!

This lovely shop is located inside the Promenade across from Nordstrom Rack. There is nothing better than a healthy smoothie after shopping. The staff is amazing and the drinks are healthy, high in protein and low in refined sugar- a combo you would be hard pressed to find elsewhere.  I highly recommend stopping by. I personally had the Gladiator drink with 45 grams of protein. It's perfect after a workout.

OHHHHH - I could not wait to get home and tell all Yelpers how AWFUL this salon is. I need less that a star - a negative star would be better! First I make an appointment for 2:30 with a lovely girl who used to work somewhere else - but I adore her so I followed her to Ocean Spa.  The guy named Don, clearly misunderstands me and puts me down for 1:30. I show up at 2:30 - and was told "We called you and you didn't answer your phone" (these idiots didn't leave a message either) - and their misunderstanding became my problem very quickly.  Don starts to ignore me, and told me there was nothing he could do - mind you the salon was empty.  I asked for the owners name, he writes down Andy and tells me he doesn't know when he will be in. Here is what I hate - I hate common working people that don't own anything and will never aspire to be anything important in life. They ruin relationships with valuable customers and make it impossible to repair them.  I will  NEVER return. They treated me like a piece of garbage, and actualy blamed me for THEIR MISTAKES!  When this dump goes out of business - everyone can kindly refer to this posting and understand why.   I hope Andy realizes his workers will take him to the poor house fast.

I started coming to this clinic because I needed to lose a few pounds and I was pretty amazed at how it worked.  The medicine is pretty awesome. The bad part is you have to take drug holidays that last 4 weeks and you are without medicine all that time.  The facility itself is small and wait times can be obnoxious.  In addition to that everyone brings their numerous amounts of kids into the clinic, even though they have requested that kids should not be brought to the clinic. This is written in Spanish and English, so the customers are rude and inconsiderate, and if you hate kids as much as I do, this will annoy you!

This particular day I was having one of the worst days in a long time.  I wasn't feeling well and I wanted to relax and have dinner with my mom.  So we were in the area of Tatum and Cactus and I decided to Yelp something from my phone.  I discover this fine little establishment with what looked to be a spectacular menu.  I thought, "If they can pull this off, I am in."  Pull it off they did, indeed.  Not only did they turn my whole day around, but I discovered a fantastic new restaurant.   We walk in, they place has only been open a few weeks, we were promptly greeted with warm inviting smiles and everyone was extremely friendly.  The build out of the restaurant was really nice and I was excited to sample the menu.  The only problem I could see, was that I could not possibly eat every dish.    I chose the Boneless Short Ribs, which came out so tender and moist and delicious, I was in heaven.  It was accompanies with a Sweet Potato mash, that was 'vanilla scented' according to the menu.  The short ribs had ancho chili chocolate sauce on top, just a light glaze that really brought out the flavor in the short ribs.  The entire meal was delightful with great service and great wine.   My mom chose to have the the Butternut Squash filled ravioli which has a delightful sauce over them and resting on a baby spinach bed.  They were fresh made, I think they make everything there.  These were awesome!  The fulling was not sweet, it tasted like they did nothing but puree the squash, simple, elegant and perfect as it is.    Apparently Rusconi's uses local produce for their menu and that insures freshness of each dish they provide.  I would definitely recommend dining here.  I saw they even had a nice happy hour menu also, available at the bar only. My next stop will be happy hour for sure. Keep up the good food and service!

I work in the same complex as this company and CJ has been the best to work with.  It started with him replacing the screen on my IMac because it had a chip in it.  I ordered it and he popped it on with great simplicity.    The next round came in when I needed to replace my hard drive in the same machine.  I was scared to do this because I thought I might lose passwords or data, but I did not lose a thing.  In fact it was exactly as I left it, only it came back with a solid state hard drive that has been the best thing since sliced bread.    If you need anything repaired, CJ is the best and will make sure it is done right!

I am not sure what all of the hype is about this restaurant, but my experience was not so pleasant. I hate to post negative reviews, and I only do when a restaurant can be spectacular and miss the mark by miles.   I came in for lunch with my brother and sat at the bar. I was pretty specific about the order and it seemed the kitchen did not understand the assignment. I ordered the Greek burger, on wheat, hold the arugula and add romaine lettuce. Meal comes out on the egg bun, no lettuce. It was taken back to have romain added, and replace the bun, and instead of romain (which I know they have because they serve Caesar salads) it comes out with red limp lettuce. Upon taking a bite of the burger, I see that the inside is completely underdone. Obviously at this point, I'm over it.   The restaurant had more staff than patrons, so I'm unsure how details are overlooked. The bartender was nice, however she did not write anything down and lacked the ability to remember and had to ask three times what the specifics were.   My brother also had a burger, the traditional one with only ketchup and mustard. Apparently it was too much of a chore to put it on the burger and it came out plain.   I wanted a burger so bad this day and normally I go to Habit Burger, and their burgers are perfect, always consistent, perfect service, hot meat and cheese, super cold veggies and no matter what I change, they always get it right. It is probably half the cost also. I chose to try something new and my level of disappointment could not be greater.   The build out was nice, but the food was unable to match the decor. I am sure the concept is good. I heard who the owning partners are, and they always have great restaurants, so I am a bit shocked I was so disappointed.   Typically in the establishments I dine in, when there is a disappointed customer, some form of management comes out to ask about the experience, get details so they can address the kitchen appropriately. Not one person came out to inquire.   Word of advice, management should always come out and find out what happen so this can be rectified. Second, if you are going to call yourself a Burger Bar, and offer all of the options shown on the menu, the kitchen should be able to understand and prepare the order, as if they ordered it, and a temperature should always be requested.

I have to admit, the name of this restaurant is perfect.  I have developed a habit for Habit Burger.  The lines are out the door at lunch time.  I see why.  And I will wait in the line every single time!. Habit Burger takes burger making very seriously and they are perfectly charred and the veggies are cold and they even have fresh grilled onions to add.  The fries and onion rings are amazing.  I cannot think of one bad thing.  Great service, happy employees, clean establishment and I am addicted!
