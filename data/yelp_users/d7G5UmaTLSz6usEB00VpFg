Couldn't even get past the extremely rude scheduling lady. My Nurse Practitioner  recommended Sylvia Castro after an urgent issue with my sonogram. I was told, that I could be seen for a month. When I told the lady it was rather urgent, she huffed on the phone and told me some other doctors were available in a couple weeks. I said jokingly "Great. Good thing I'm, not dying." She huffed again. I then said "Fine" as in "Fine" schedule me, and she hung up on me. I started to call back and I asked myself "why"? Called my my doctors office and they recommended me to another fantastic doctor with a lovely receptionist that got me in stat. The doctor might be great if you could get past the rude staff.

I had done Bikram Yoga for a year before I came to this studio. I had a 30 day unlimited yoga Groupon and since this studio was slightly closer to my house I figured I'd try it for a month. I haven't gone back to my old studio.  The room is huge with four rows which makes it super nice even on crowded days. The locker rooms are roomy with multiple showers compared to the one at my old studio. The instructors are wonderful. At times tough and at time inspiring, but always helpful and consistent with the class and dialogue (a complaint of mine at my last studio).  But the absolute best thing about this studio is the sense of community here. They have potlucks and fundraisers for charity and parties every now and then. It is really great to get to know instructors and fellow students outside the classroom.  It is tough some days to put yourself in a hot room and practice yoga, but you always feel welcomed and at home when you come here to practice.

My husband and I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. We use to be huge fans of the Ahi Tuna burger with sweet potato fries (the fries rock). Unfortunately, they removed the Ahi Tuna burger from the menu which was very disappointing. I do like the Tiki fish sandwich though. I do which that they would included a fish sandwich on their lunch menu on the weekend. Although, when I have gone for lunch on the weekend and have asked if they can make a fish sandwich they have always accommodated me.   I would give this place 5 star, but I think their one weakness is their brunch menu. I took a friend there for lunch because we loved their dinner and lunch menu so much, but it was very disappointing. We ordered Bloody Mary's and had to send them back because the horseradish was overwhelming. In fact, all you could taste was horseradish, no tomato juice or anything. All three of us sent them back and they could remake them because they were part of a batch that they pre-mixed - UGH! Plus, I was the only one that liked my breakfast. My husband and friend were not impressed.   Also, I adore their Hawaiian fish ceviche - yum!!

I think after tonight, this will be the last time I go to Richardson's. My husband likes the place, but I find it overpriced for the quality of food. However, I thought it would be nice to take him there tonight for his birthday. First, you can't make a reservation unless you have a party of four and as I discovered, there are no tables for two people. So when we got to the restaurant, there were no tables available and the bar was full, so we were offered a side bar area or outside sitting at a coffee table type area. Less than stellar choices for a birthday dinner. Finally, we got a couple seats at the bar. I ordered the Grouper with caper lemon butter sauce. Imagine my surprise when I received my dish and there were no capers. Everytime that I have had a caper sauce it has had capers in it. When I asked about it, they looked at me like I was crazy. Plus, all the sauce was absorbed by the tortilla on the plate. So I basically I paid $27 bucks for a dry Grouper with asparagus. My husband kind of liked his dish, but he was not overwhelmed. Yeah, the last time we will go there.

I really, really wanted to like this place when I went, but it just didn't happen. I went on a nice peaceful Sunday morning to meet some friends and discuss an upcoming project we are working on. I parked my car and walked up to JoBot only to hear club  music blasting from a D.J. in the front sitting area. All I could think was, please let my friends be inside because I cannot listen to club music first thing in the A.M. I could only think how much worse it would be if I was hungover. Thank goodness my friends were inside.   When I walked inside, I really liked the old house feel, but the place could have seriously used a good scrubbing.  It felt grimy and dingy rather than fresh and vintage.  I am a tea drinker, so I was a bit disappointed with their tea selection. It was nothing to write home about.  My friends were in the back room and as I walked over to them there was a spot in the floor I almost fell through - I'm not kidding. And I am not a heavy girl either - 115 lbs. The floor boards were stripped away and there was a thin layer of old wood between me and the crawl space. I about pissed myself when I stepped on it and felt the wood bend and start to give. Needless to say it was not the relaxing leisurely Sunday morning I had in mind.

The Oink Cafe is still young so I am hoping for improvements, not so much with the food, but really with the service.   I met a client there one morning for breakfast and although the service was okay, the food was wonderful. I decided to go back the next day for breakfast again and try the French Toast this time. I went to the hostess stand and waited to be seated. I stood there and stood there. I even had a waitress that was standing by the bar doing nothing look right at me and look away. Finally, another waitress running food told her to seat me and she came over and did. I had the French Toast. It was terrific! I wish they had let the bread soak a little longer, but for the most part it was delicious!   I took my husband there the next Saturday and just more service problems. The waitress again was rough. My husband's omelet  was wonderful but the home fries were cold. You could tell they sat getting cold until the omelet was done. My French Toast was good, but really dry. Again they didn't let it soak long enough.   The concept is great and the food is terrific, but there is still some operational issue that need to be worked out. Better training of the waitresses or better waitresses. The kitchen seemed to struggle during the busy weekend compared as to when I was there during the weekday. I will go back as the food is really good and I hope that they mature!
