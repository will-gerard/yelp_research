Good food and ice cold drinks meet Rock music!  A first choice before or after any event at USAirways Center or Chase Field.  The place fills up quick on event nights so show up early!

I've never had a bad dish from Tolteca!  Portions are huge, but the prices are small.  Save room on the way out because their bakery is top notch!

We took my 20 month old son to Imagination Avenue on a smoking hot summer Saturday afternoon.  This place was a big win-win for my son and my wife and me!    My son had a blast going from building to building playing in the different themes.  I would say hands down his favorites were the Home Depot, fire department, and jail. He also loved puttering around the track in one of the trucks.  He wasn't however fond of the hospital for some reason.  My wife a I walked away winners because of the inexpensive price ($9), and a cool safe environment our son could have fun and burn off some of that toddler energy!  We also liked the fact that it gives him an opportunity to be around new kids and socialize.  I only wish they had longer hours, but like the fact you can rent the place out on a Sunday.  This place was cheap, clean, friendly, and had just what it takes to put a huge smile on my sons face!  We may even take up their yearly pass offer for Christmas or his birthday!

This place is one of a kind!  My wife and I went on the nite of 12/5 and not only got a   real good meal for peanuts, but a wedding too!  I too used the Entertainment coupon.  Give this place a try if you haven't already.

This is one of the best airports I have ever used! The best part is that is is my home airport. It is one of the busiest, and biggest airports in the world. It is serviced by all of the major carriers such as US Airway (Hub), Southwest (hub) Delta, American, Cont., United, Jet Blue, Air Tran, Hawaiian, and several more! The site offers FREE WiFi, plenty of top notch placed to grab a bite, or sit down for a meal. It was voted the "Friendliest" airports in America too. I can not say enough good things about this airport. Traveling is difficult enough, but this airports makes it a little better.

This place ranks right up near the tippy top of my 2 1/2 year olds favorite places!    He can run around and go crazy at the playground, enjoy the model train sets, ride a few trains around the park that go over bridges and through tunnels, go on the merry go round, and even cool off with some yummy ice cream!    Even though it is a far drive from Surprise,  I like the free admission to the park, ample free parking, and clean picnic areas.    If you are looking for a day of cheap fun for you little ones, look no further!  This place is a gem!

The place is a bit hard to find in the back of the business park, BUT it is well worth the effort! I had the chicken cordon blu sandwich, and my friend had the lasagna. The place can get packed during the lunch and breakfast rush so try to hit them up in between if you can. You will walk away one happy camper I guarantee!

My wife and I took our 5 1/2 month old to their ER one Sunday morning with a high fever and bad congestion.  The admit process was exceptional fast and friendly! Once they took him back the high quality care continued straight through.  Everyone told us their name and what they came into his room for.  In about half the time I had expected, we were on our way.  You never want to take your little boy to the ER, but Banner Thunderbird made it smooth and reassuring!

I like this place! The sauce isn't overpowering, but still adds a strong enough flavor. Yams have always been large and cooked just right. If you are going to order an appetizer give the fried pickles a try!  More times than not I order the brisket platter.  Always has been piled high too! The only sandwich I have had that was too greasy was the combo. That one gives you some pork, and beef. The slaw is one of the better sides I've had in the Valley.  The service can get slow if the place gets slammed.

I went into this dining experience with fairly reasonable expectations.  In a nutshell I was looking for this place to be at least on a similar level as Sweet Tomato's on the other side of the street (Bell Rd).  However Souper Salad fell way short!  This particular location seems as if it needs a total refresh, almost like it is stuck in the year 2009.  The seats, plates, and overall buffet stations are in desperate need of replacing.  I've never seen a restaurant with such worn out plates and seats in my life!  The variety of the food was nice, but do they actually need to use fake cheddar cheese?  The menu online actually points this out!  My last negative is the fact that on this night the food selections took way too long to be replenished.  The fact that the restaurant wasn't overly busy or dead for that matter, makes it worse.  The two positives I took away were the friendliness of the staff, and the strawberry shortcake.  Next time I am looking for a salad buffet style restaurant, I'll be going to Sweet Tomato's across the street!

This place is a disaster!  Messy aisles, a few food items I picked up had days left before expiration, some prices the same as a regular grocery / discount store, and staff members who had a hard time with the English language.  I'm sure you can save a few bucks shopping here, but for me it's not worth the hassle.

I will never understand why this place is always packed? The steaks although lean are never cooked the way you ask them to be. The pulled pork sandwich comes dry (no sauce what so ever). I also think they use more salt then any other eatery I have gone to. You shouldn't have so much salt on the fries that you have to search for signs of potato. I understand people get a kick out of throwing the peanut shells on the floor and all, but it also makes this one of the dirtiest restaurants around. Yes the rolls are flavorful, but tend to be on the hard side. One of my two stars go to their sweet tea. If you pick this place to eat give it a try.   On a side note the wait staff tends to sing Happy Birthday at the top of their lungs every five minutes. Be ready to scream to the person at your table if you want to be heard.

Enter at your own risk!!! Went to take a look at a used Malibu and had perhaps the worst car shopping experience of my life! Now the first salesman that greeted us was OK. He knew his stuff, was pleasant, and was reasonable to deal with. EVERYONE after him lived up to the typical car dealer stereotype. Instead of going on and on about my bad experience I will just list what went on...   1) I was told I was NOT American if I even considered another car   2) I was told it would be worth it to spend more then I had planned on a car cause it "wouldn't break down as much"   3) I was told I had great credit (I do) first, and then questionable credit later into the dealing   4) Had to get my cell phone out and threaten to call the police to get my keys back after a test drive   5) While walking out the door my wife and I were called stupid for not taking their "deal" by a manager   These "salesmen" crossed several lines that Saturday afternoon, and I hope anyone in the market for a car, truck, or what ever will think twice about giving this place the time of day. If you do happen to stop by, DON'T give them your keys in exchange for a test drive!  If you do have your cell ready to call the police if you want to walk away.

I love Pullano's!  This place has fantastic pizza and wings!  They've been around since 1979 and are a great place to enjoy any type of sporting event.  Be sure to hit them up on Wednesday for their pizza special.  I always walk away from this place full and happy!

If you are like me,  you are so sick of cookie cutter, bland chain burger joints.  That is the reason why I love this place so much!  I usually go with the "On the Border Burger" with fries and a cherry vanilla Mister Pibb.  The bar is worth hitting up too if you are in the market to throw back a few while any of the local Valley sports teams play.  Outside of that, the toppings bar is well stocked, and clean.  The food is always tasty and made in front of you with a relatively short wait.  The restaurant is easy to find on the south east corner of 15th Ave & Thomas.  My only star deduction is due to the fact that the tables are usually not cleaned well or fast enough.  I shouldn't have to clean up after the last customer, but most of the time I have.

This place is H U G E!!!  Aisles and aisles of possible treasure.  Every turn you make is a surprise.  Overall I found the prices on the stuff I was looking for to be very reasonable.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable too.  Since their inventory changes constantly, if you don't find your diamond in the rough today, come back tomorrow!  I for for one can't wait to get back!

After picking my mom up from a l o n g cross country flight from NY one morning, a hearty breakfast was first on her list.  I took a look at what my fellow Yelpers had rated high, and nearby.  Harlow's Cafe came back loud and clear!    My mom had the super sized, ultra delicious Belgian waffle.  It of course came with butter and maple syrup.  As for myself, I went with the regular stack (5) buttermilk pancakes.  These hotcakes were easily 1" thick if not more!  I always come prepared with a monster appetite, but sadly, I was defeated by the flapjacks in this semi eating challenge.  To sum it all up.  The meals were both giant and delicious, the bill total was under $20, and we left the cafe happy campers.

This place is one of my favorite venues for both sports and music.  I can say that I have never had a bad seat at Jobbing.com arena.  The place is home to the NHLs Phoenix Coyotes, and  all types of live  major entertainment tours.  Tons of free parking and near some fantastic places to eat and shop in Westgate City Center.

Big Hengs is the underdog restaurant you can't help but love and look forward to coming back for more.  Granted, as most others have mentioned, they place is anything but sexy. However who cares?  The food quality and quantity is as good as it gets.  The prices are so cheap I guarantee you'll do a double take.  The staff is some of the nicest I've ever met, and the atmosphere is interesting to say the least.  It only took my very first dining experience at Big Hengs to give them the crown!  Everything is good, but my favorite is the Walnut Shrimp.

Roll up the sleeves cause it is BBQ time! I never seem to get to this place enough. If you want beef that will melt in your mouth go for the Burnt Tips! You will thank yourself while you eat. Dillon's does get pretty packed on Friday and Saturday so try to go a little earlier or later. I go that route and find it easier to get in. Nothing special about the decor, but what do you want? Top notch BBQ or fancy shamcy art? Put this place on your list of must try! They have a decent bar too, so enjoy an icy one with those tips!

Made the drive up from Phoenix, AZ to take in Vegas for a weekend. It was kind of a last minute decision so the selection for hotels under $100 was thin. This place came in at $90NT. I usually stay on the strip, but for the price and monorail stop I figured why not! Location wise it isn't far from the strip at all, but I would not take a stroll around the hood if you don't have to. It is located on the northern (older) side of the strip around the Riviera, Circus Circus, and still in the works Fountain Blue. Check-in was the worst part of the stay by far. The long took FOREVER! I wish I had WiFi!!! You actually can get WiFi, but of course it comes with a steep $13 fee. When will hotels learn we want FREE WiFi with our stays!!! Moving on...the room was on the 21st floor, clean, and with a nice view of the eastern city/mountains. The TV was also pretty impressive, but the service was typical poor hotel quality. As for the bed...I would trade mine in for one of theirs in a bat of an eye. Sooooo comfy!!! We didn't spend much time in the casino, but their Sports book is one of the best in Vegas. All and all i was very happy with our stay, and would consider them again if the price was right.   P.S. They seem do cater to the business traveler, and so their weekend rates seem to be cheaper then most.

To be honest, I have lost my enjoyment of going to the movies.  Far too often the titles to choose from are uninteresting, the theaters are too crowded, full of rude patrons, and or dirty.  To top it all off, you get to pay almost in upwards of $10 to experience all of this!  Harkins Camelview is one of those gems in the rough!!!  The movies they play are some of the best indie titles running, the theaters aren't the size of a sports arena, the seats are almost comfortable enough to fall asleep in, everything is well kept and I've never had an instance where the patrons ruined my movie watching experience!  As stated before too the popcorn is perhaps the best you'll find!  I am also a big fan of the great location, and retro design of the movie house!  The next time you want to get out of the house and take in a movie, be sure to give Harkins Camelview 5 a try!

Ohhhh where do I begin??? The weekend is usually a tough time for my wife and I. We scour Yelp! all day to find the perfect new place to go out to eat on a Saturday night. On this particular Saturday it was my turn to choose the spot. I was in the mood for BBQ, but was some what tired of the usual places on our list. Well then came Bobby Q's! Coming from the Surprise area it was an easy ride down Olive to Black Canyon Hwy. As stated several times already, the place is somewhat hard to spot as it i set back from the road with limited signage, but we made it into the lot on our second pass. It was about 6:30 and we didn't have reservations, but fear not! The wait we were told would only be about 20 minutes. The time came and went however no open table. The greeter apologized for the delay, but offered for us to wait in the VIP lounge for a drink and free onion block appetizer. We no sooner go our drink and the table was ready! Everything was moved over to our table and away were went to enjoy our dinner. The service was as good as it gets, A+! My wife went for the Smoasted Chicken with sides of baked potato, and roasted corn. I opted for the slow roasted beef brisket sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese. Once the server brought over the onion block, and corn bread we wee set. The onion block was fantastic and big enough for up to three people. The corn bread was perhaps the best I was had in all of Arizona! My wife rated her chicken dish an 8 and sides a 8 as well. When all was said and done...she was STUFFED! As for myself, the sandwich was just big enough to satisfy my apatite, and was delivered just as the menu stated! Deeeeelishous! As for the mac & cheese...have you ever had something so good it cold buckle your knees? Yeah, it was THAT good! No matter what you order from the menu, get a side of mac & cheese! As we finished up the owner himself came over to our table to see how our experience went. The OWNER! Not some manager, but the man himself! When all was said and done the bill came to just under $30. I did not order a Alcohol based drink, only Dr. Pepper, but they too looked top notch from those around us who indulged. Bottom line is this place is now my favorite BBQ spot in the valley, and given the chance it will be yours too!

Sure you will pay a steep price when shopping at AJ's.  However their quality, or ability to offer hard to find foods is out of this world!  I have never found their products to be anything but stellar.  I don't shop here often, but when I do, I'm always blown away!

Great payouts, dirt cheap great tasting beer, and a fun relaxed atmosphere has kept me coming back to the Station for years!  The strip is fun of course, but this place is built for the common man!  The guy who has a taste for craft beer cheap and icy cold.  The guy who wants his fun at the slots or tables to last, just a little bit longer!  I'm by no means saying stay off the strip.  I am however saying this place has to be put on your list of places to spend a few hours on your next trip to Sin City.

My wife and I visited The Boulders for a weekend to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary.  We both loved the luxurious experience you get from check in to check out!  Everything about the resort was so relaxing and scenic.  Since we live in the west side of the valley, it was nice to get to a higher elevation with cooler temps and a breeze.  The resort is pricey, and so that is why I deducted one star.  I feel as if some things could be updated, and the WiFi drops out or is extremely slow.  That said, I would most certainly welcome a return in the near future!

Worst large newspaper in the US!  Their products are overpriced, and grossly slanted to the far left.  Although there is a very easy way to read their articles for free (past the ten each month they give you), you won't see much need to use it.  Their journalists are usually very sloppy and always favor the liberal view.  The best media outlets will give you both sides of a story.  If that's what you are looking for keep looking.  Overall it's sad to only give the AZ Republic one star.  They should be one of the best in the nation.  That day will never come until standards are raised and accountability to report all the facts are held up.

This bar is the perfect blend of what I look for in my type of watering hole.  Start off with strong large volume drinks add a shot of good tex-mex bar food a splash of several TVs tuned to sports, shake and serve over cheap prices!  On a recent trip up to Vegas, my wife and I were in search for great spots the locals approve of.  Paradise did not disappoint!  I have added this place to the must do list when in Sin City, and you should too!

I loved this place when I lived in upstate New York, and would do a day in Toronto!  So you can imagine my level of excitement when I found out that we had two locations RIGHT HERE in the Valley!!!  Well  kinda.  I still like this location, and will most certainly make the trip to Tempe.    The menu is a bit different from the Canadian version I adore, but nevertheless, the selection is solid and quality is high.  If an appetizer is what you want, look no further then the chips and quaso.  The pizza I am convinced you just simply can't go wrong with on any selection.  They also offer plenty of other items such a burgers, salads, pasta and more.  The only part that I found to be negative was the mighty slow service for a slow Saturday night.  The bar area was solid, but the dinning side was rather slow.  I feel as if one has three tables to tend to, that he or she should be of reasonable speed when it comes to taking orders and refilling drinks.  Overall though I am still real happy to have Boston Pizza in Metro Phoenix, and am looking forward o my next trip!

Cheap fare, clean, GPS accurate schedule times, fast, I feel safe, and well planned around major landmarks.  I could go on and on, but I say go give it a try!  The light rail is a fantastic alternative to going to Sky Harbor, a Sports event or concert in Phoenix or on ASU, a gathering at Tempe Lake Park, or just to grab dinner and drinks.  The best part too is the fact that future expansion to Glendale and deeper into Mesa will make the rail only better.

Well...I just paid a little over $27 for two sandwiches that just may have been the worst burgers I've ever had in my 32 years.  After seeing the promo pictures for the "Big Bacon Burger" I figured I was in for a delicious meal!  Perhaps it is just me, but when I spend $10 for a low quality beef, burger and only taste BBQ sauce, I'm left a bit one on the unhappy side.  I could have spent 1/10 of the money and been more satisfied at McDonald's.  I'm not sure I have to mention the annoying service you get, but unless your nation CHAIN has just opened, you don't need to ask if I have ever dinned here before.  I think I can figure out how a lazy, uninspired burger joint works on my own.

Usually fast food franchises take great care to make sure their locations all offer the same value and service.  This location however slips through the cracks.  In three tries, the same lady has messed up my order.  In each visit she blamed being new.  Perhaps staff should be fully trained in their duties before jockeying the register.  In terms of speed, you will not find it here.  Expect a long wait inside or at the window.  I could could go on about the cleanliness, but why bother.  They aren't the most accurate, fastest or cleanest, but they can take your money!

Subway is an average at very best meal to start with.  Throw in staff that make it perfectly clear that you are inconveniencing them by ordering a turkey /ham sub.  You are left with a 1 star review, and a customer who will not return.

I've never had a bad meal at the Tavern.  Drinks are fantastic too!  I also would like to point out the fact it is REAL easy to get to from the light rail.  I will suggest that you may want to think twice about coming here when an event is going in around Tempe Lake, or ASU.  The service simply can not keep up.  Outside of an event though this is a great place to try.

I don't even think about what store I want to go to when it comes to groceries. Down the street from my house, good prices on the core items I buy each week, clean, good beer selection, high quality produce and at least in this location, FREE WiFi! I am also a fan of the number of self checkouts my local store has. Although the staff is always friendly, I want want to get in and out ASAP!

Called to schedule a date and time to install the dishwasher we purchased from Lowe's, and never showed up or called to explain why.  East Valley should be avoided at all cost!  They have such low customer service standards you'll only be left with more cleanup when all is said and done.

Outside of the insanely high sale tax that is charged in the City of El Mirage (I can't hold the store responsible for that), this is the most convenient and friendliest place to shop for just about all your needs in El Mirage.

My wife and I just got home from a long flight and wanted some Chinese for dinner on a Sunday night. Not wanting to go to a buffet and over eat bland dishes...we thought we'd try this local place. Well...I wish we didn't! Although I am going to give them two stars for the cleanliness and friendly greeting...that's about where it ends. I tried the cashew chicken and my wife tried the sweet & sour chicken. I refuse to order a drink from places that only serve cans of over priced soda, but my wife had a .99 cent can of 7UP. As for the food...my dish was way too hot (still steaming 15 mins later, the chicken at times had globs of fat on it, and every so often I would find bits of other dishes in it. I ate about 1/3 of my large order and threw the rest out. My wife thought her sweet & sour chicken was so-so, and the rice that came with our order was very dry and tasteless. I want to close with the menu had NO General Tao or Sesame Chicken! Two very common staples! In closing the place is clean, and people nice, but you can do much better for even average Chinese food.

How can you not love Westgate??? They really do have it all for everyone!!!   Plenty of places to get a bite to eat. A few places you can enjoy are Southwest Moes, Margarita, Johnny Rockets, Ocean Blue, Cold Stone, a new pizza place that slips my mind, and so much more. If you want BBQ, frozen yogurt, burgers, steak, or what ever else makes you say yum...they have it!   If you have the itch to shop, they can satisfy your every need! I always pop in to Just Sports to see what they have for my favorite Valley team...Go Coyotes!!!   Speaking of entertainment! They have it all... a huge AMC movie complex, first class Jobbing.com Arena (Phoenix Coyotes NHL hockey, concerts, and more), UPS right next door for Cards football, and conventions. Plenty of thirst quenching bars, and one certain days of the week, live music in the splash pad area in front of AMC.   As if you need more...WG is clean, safe, easy to get to from any place in the Valley, and plenty of free parking! I am not the only one who loves this place. Every time my family gets visitors from New York come in, WG is always a must stop!

If I were a fat man, Chuy's would be one of the reasons why!  Crazy cheep drinks, big portions, and a free chip & salsa bar.  They have several big screen TVs so you won't miss the big game(s) either.  They have a real nice selection of beers on tap, and some of the best drink & food happy hour (3-7pm) specials in town.  If they add queso to the chip bar I'm moving in!

Took the wife's car in for new motor mounts and coolant hoses.  The work took almost all day, but their location to the light rail made the day fly by.  I was extremely happy with the quality of work completed.  Price was a little high on the labor side, but the job was difficult so I can kinda look past that.  The only negative I have was that the goal in the beginning was to add as much work "needed" on my car as they could.  I know you just have to say no thank you, but it gets annoying having to keep the focus on what you came in for.  That being said I would definitely go back to 180 for my future car repair needs.

So you want a delicious sandwich on the strip, but don't want to spend all your gambling and drinking money?  Look no further than the E.O.S.!  This place has a great menu of quality sandwiches, freshly made to order, fast, and for under $9.  Even in the middle of a feeding rush, they had our meal ready to eat in under 5 minutes.  As for seating, it didn't look that big, but we had no trouble getting a table.  They are open 24 hours now too so time of day is never a factor.  I stopped short of "going all in" and slapping down a 5 star because of one thing.  The soda fountain prices are crazy!  Hell $3 for a regular cup?  If it even matters they have Pepsi products, ice tea, and coffee.  Overall this place is a jackpot on the strip for fast, tasty sandwiches at any time of the day.

The Parking Spot has been MY parking spot when going to Sky Harbor since 2005!  I have never had an issue making my flight when parking and shuttling from here at any time of the year.  Over the past 11 years, I have parked here during all the months and specifically all the major holidays, and have found everything to be very safe, organized, and friendly.  One thing to remember if you do plan to park here during the holidays, be sure to reserve your spot as early as you can.  The lot will be packed!

Stopped by on a Saturday night when I had a taste for a sandwhich with some meat to it! I sure am glad I gave Jason's a try. They had a pretty wide selection on their menu from regular deli sandwiches to wraps, and a good sized salad bar. I went with the Royal Club with baked chips and a sweet tea. The club was packed with fresh quality meats, the croissant was nice and flaky, and the chips (Lays I believe) was a nice side. As for the sweet tea...perfect! I am very picky about sweet tea, and this one was just how I like it. The meal came in under $10 and came with the FREE soft serve ice cream! How can you NOT walk away happy from a meal that ends in free ice cream??? :)

I've heard about this place from friends of mine for at least a year, but never had the desire and chance meet up in my schedule to give Two Hippies a shot. What the hell was I thinking??? I love this place!!! First off this place is as small and simple as it gets. Their location makes parking a car tough, but is only a short walk east from the Central and Indian School light rail stop.   On to what matter's FOOD! In order to judge just how good they were I went for the simplest meal on their menu. Just a cheese burger, sack of fries, and can of soda/water. The burger was exactly how I like'em. Fresh ground beef, char grilled taste, fresh soft roll, six (not the usual 2 or 3) dill pickles, crisp lettuce, and thousand island dressing (you can get tomato, but I passed). The fries came in a small paper bag (sack), and were lightly salted and seasoned. Their drink choices are Shasta soda or bottled water. If you go the soda route give the fruit punch a go it was fruit-tastic! I came hungry and left satisfied all for $5 EVEN! How can you beat a delicious charbroiled burger, seasoned fries and a drink for only $5? You can spend more based on the type of burger or less if you get their sliders ($3). They also have countless different sauces along with Ketchup and mustard to top off your meaty treat. I went at 1:30pm on a Friday, but figure they get pretty busy around the noon time lunch rush. On my next visit I plan to try one of their big magic brownies.   If your on the go and want to chow down on an above average burger and want to spend under $10 this is your place.

I am so lucky being a baseball fan to have this park right down the street from my house!  This maybe not the best Cactus League park, but it is still a gem in my opinion.  Plenty of FREE parking, reasonably priced seats, plenty of shaded areas for when you don't want sun stroke, nice archaically design, and a very convenient location are the qualities that rate this such a nice park.  I could see if you were from out of town where this would be a great ballpark too, with the hotels within walking distance, or a very short drive away.  The other thing they offer is a $35 Party Tent ticket.  You get a great covered seat, 1 free beer or drink, and all the food you can eat!  They have a different restaurant cater depending on the day of the week.  If you haven't been out to Surprise to catch a game, you are definitely missing out!

Simply put, Camelback Movers are the best.  Sure I could tell you how well the team working together in order to move my families possessions in a fast (time in case IS money), careful manor, but I doubt Yelp has enough space.  Moving is stressful enough, take it from us and relieve some stress and go with Camelback Moving.  It will be your best move yet!

Although this location has convenience and reasonable prices going for it, that is about where it ends.  The selection of brands is very limited, and more important than that, the expiration dates are not monitored by the staff.  Unfortunately when stores do not see enough shoppers come through the doors to buy their goods, the goods sit and collect dust.  On countless occasions I have stop by this location only to find the items I need are either expired already on the shelf, or have limited time left.  I will give this store two stars for cleanliness and convince, but overall you would be better off just going to a store that has much more traffic.

What a great water park for kids!  They have water slides, swimming areas, a lazy river, a giant bucket that tips over when it gets full, misting areas, and plenty of shaded areas with tables and chairs.  The Changing rooms as with the rest of the park are well kept and clean too.  As for safety, lifeguards are positioned all over just in case.  The craziest thing about this place is how cheap it is to get in!  Thank you so much to the city of Chandler.  Why can't my home city of Surprise put even half the effort as Chandler has into public parks like this?  I'm jealous!, and certainly will be back while the temps stay warm.

Top notch NY style pizza.   One of the best in El Mirage / Surprise.  I'm alway greeted with a smile when I order my pie. The wings are ok, but could be better.  I also can say this is one of the cleanest places you can eat!  Please give these guys a try!

I can sum up my experience at BJs in one word...Fail!   First off, we called ahead on a Saturday night after a Coyotes game, and were told 30 mins. We show up with 5 mins to spare and were told we would be seated in 5 mins...right on time. Only 5 mins in BJs time is 25 mins! At the 15 min mark I asked how much longer it would be, but was told they simply "don't really know". While waiting for our table we were repeatedly told by the staff how tired they were.   Once seated I was firmly told by the waitress that they do NOT have Dr. Pepper, Pibb, or anything similar! They were awful proud of their root beer! :(. I hate root beer.   My wife and I decided to split a large bacon cheese burger pizza at the reasonably low price of $24!!! Although the pizza was good, by no means was it worth that much. Way too greasy, and although we asked for no tomatoes, they seemed to put double the norm. It would have been sent back, but again BJs time is about double normal time.   I wanted to like this place, but the experience was just too poor to even give them a second chance. Take a pass if your in the Park West / Westgate area!

I've been to the Bell Centre five times in my life for Canadians games. All five times I left in awe!!! The place is HUGE with a 21,000 capacity for sporting events, and I'd guess an additional 3,000 for concerts.   The air inside for hockey is electric! Location is prime too. You can get to high quality hotels, Casino de Montreal, delicious restaurants, fun pubs, and great shops all within walking distance or a short taxi ride. The concessions and bathrooms are well placed and reasonably priced (for being an arena).  The only negative I have is that for 21,000 seats the concourses are so narrow! It will take a good amount of time to get out if you stay till the end.  This place is a must see if you ever get the chance to take in a game or concert in Montreal!!!

When I came to pickup my car, I was told to expect a little smoking from some violent that spilt while they were refilling it. This smoking continued for about 15 miles!  The next morning I noticed a big pool of coolant under my car as I backed out.  Come to find out they never fixed the problem the first time, and wanted even more to fix what was originally wrong, and water pump!  They were so careless about working on my car that the tech left his greased up rags on my seat.  Well in the end I too got a taste of their poor customer service.  They may have got an extra few bucks out of me, but they lost a repeat customer.    One needs to only look at the number of reviews by people who only have a few reviews to realize their rating is bloated and fake.

Here is what this "Honest" business owner sent me a earlier today...  Tom Y. "I think your shirt says it all, about you, Stupid People with power."  Shame on him for harassing an honest review!  Don't blame me for providing me an awful experience.

If high quality, fresh fish and seafood is what your fishing for, head to the Pier! Oscar's Pier 83 has one of the selections of not only food, and cooking styles, but beverages as well. Along with the typical line of American beers, they also have several smaller brews like Alaskan, and imports from all over. They also serve wine, soda, and bottled water. As for the "meat", they have several types of fish, soft shell crabs, oysters, scallops, shrimp and more. Price wise figure about $10 for the average seafood dish. Portion size is not great, but you won't be looking for more either. I was highly impressed with their slaw, and tarter sauce (made with dill!). If a member of your party isn't into food from the sea, Oscar's has a nice menu of sandwiches, and salads. Coming from NY, this is one of the best places to eat if you want some offerings from the sea in the desert.

Wanna have a good time???  Of course you do!!!  This casino packs a good punch for its smallish size.  A decent number of tables, and slots with a slightly better then I expected payout.  I also noticed the BAD Bingo ads, and think my next trip back will have to include some games!!!  As for the drinks, they were nice and generous!!!  The restaurants looked like they would be worth a taste test too.  Although I live way up in the northwest part of the Valley, I certainly be making a return trip soon!!!

Yikes!!!  What a disaster!  My family was in search of a simple Saturday night dinner and were not looking to leave our home city of Surprise.  The last B.W.W. was a flop and didn't last long, but thought maybe this time around would be different.  Nope.    This place in a nutshell is over priced per frozen food served by a sloppy, fake, incompetent waitstaff.  A small order of boneless wings go for about $10.  As soon as we were seated a guy came to our table proclaiming we looking like we didn't knew what we wanted, and if we wanted to follow him to try their sauces and rubs.  No thank you.  He then asked us to fill out our contact info in order to be entered in to win free wings for a year.  No thank you.  After that, another guy came to our table asking if we wanted to try some chicken artichoke sample.  No thank you.  All this before we even looked past page 1 of the menu!  I could go on about the four various staff members who came to our table asking if we ordered various dishes, or the lady who brought our food to the table who just pointed at the plate (I assume she couldn't speak English), but you get the point.    The food was ok, but the staff can't get out of their own way.  When told, "Please come see us again soon, my response was like the rest during that visit.  No thank you!

Living in Phoenix, Arizona I have plenty of choices when it comes to my air travel needs. When ever possible I go with Atlanta based Delta airlines. They have several good choices for what helps me most, red eye flights to the East. I usually take the late night flight to Atlanta on a Boeing 757. The planes have always been clean, and (at least on the larger 757s) come with personal TVs! I am also a big fan of the snack choices they offer. Go with the cookies, trust me :). Some folks base reviews of delays, but no airline can control the weather, and if there is a problem with the aircraft I have no problem with a delay! As of late they also seem to be the cheapest option on search sites like Kayak.

If a simple, fresh quality lunch at a reasonable price is what you are looking for, look no further than the Lunch Break.  The restaurant is a bit off the beaten path, but relatively easy to find with Waze or any other GPS app.  On my last visit I tried the BBQ chicken wrap and was impressed with the fresh delicious ingredients they used.  The wrap was also stuffed to gills with chicken.  I hate places that make their sandwiches look big, only to take a bite and find them filled with too much lettuce or other fillers.  The restaurant has some nice outdoor seating for when the temps are comfortable.  If it's too toasty outside though, they have plenty of tables inside along with a large screen TV to watch.  All and all Lunch Break is a great change from the bland chains and well worth a try for lunch or breakfast.

My wife and I went to the Hurricane Grill on Valentines for dinner.  Overall we had a better then average experience and will be coming back.  The place was pretty full with tons of TVs and various games for all sports fans.  The drink specials were plentiful and reasonably priced.  As far as the food goes.  The menu has a tropical beach feel, but with a wide verity for all tastes.  My choice was the pulled pork quesadilla and cyclone sauce on the side. The pork was tender, flavorful, and not overly salty.  The sauce packed plenty of flavor, but not as hot as I thought it would be.  The only real down side, and the reason for the one star deduction, was that it was very greasy. Other then that, the staff was pleasant and prompt.  We might not go back on a regular basis, but we will be back for sure!

I would like to start off by saying that I was never a fan of Apple or Apple products in the past. Several of my friends raved about their IPod Touches and after some time i broke down and took the plunge! Well less then two months into my relationship with this insanely addictive device I hit a snag. I wen to charge up the battery for a not so exciting four hour flight cross country when the pod wouldn't recognize the USB cable. To say I was unhappy would be a huge understatement. I took my flight with a broken Touch dead as a door nail. As soon as I got back home i went to the Apple on-line store and made an appointment the very next day to find out why my 45 day old device has already hit FAIL. After being a dumbass and walking by the store I missed my schedule appointment time of 11:40am. The guy holding a working device told me however I was in luck, and to come back in 30 minutes and "we'll get this thing fixed!". I found some much to look at in the store I didn't even have to leave. When my time hit they called me over and down to business we got. The girl who took care of me was as good as they get when it came to greeting me and making me feel as if it will be all right. After running some tests on the device and the cable, it turned out the cable was defective and not the Touch. In under ten minutes she gave me a brand new cable and I was on my way. Now although I was real unhappy about being able to use my Touch on the flight the day before, the fine folks at the Arrowhead Apple Store made things right! Top notch to them...This experience has changed the way I view the Apple brand. Thank you.

I'm such a fan of FroYo.  To have this place a short walk away is a nice neighborhood perk.  A decent verity of frozen yogurts, huge selection of high quality toppings, reasonable prices, and a friendly staff make this place a winner!  They also have a loyalty club, so be sure to get a card.

Oooooohhhhh baby!!!  My new favorite sweet treat du jour!!!  I needed a good treat to turn my pregnant wife's bad day around.  A few rave reviews by some friends at work made my search easy.  Although they are on the pricey side, you will be well satisfied with just one of these mammoth cakes.  I still went with the four pack figuring they would last another day in the fridge.  As for my picks...Oreo, PB Cup, Carrot cake, and chocolate chip cookie.  All four had amazingly thick sweet frosting that tasted like their name.  The cake is very moist and coco-rific!  The only downside with this place is it's location.  Don't blink because you'll pass it by.  I had to actually refer to the mall map after I walked by and missed it.  Favorite Cup Cake: Oreo 2nd place: Peanut butter Cup

If Chinese buffet is what you desire, just keep driving northwest on Grand to the other place!    The food is low quality and the place is one of the dirtiest I've seen in the Valley!  They do have a friendly staff and a vast selection, and so I can award them one star.    Overall this is as bad as it gets, and would have to be starving to walk away satisfied eating here.

This park is a GEM! Located on the western side of El Mirage Road, half way between Olive and Cactus. The park has everything you need to enjoy an day or night outside. The sports fan will enjoy the two first class baseball diamonds, football/soccer fields, basketball courts, and skate park. If you are just looking to go for a run or even a walk, the park has a large track that circles the sports fields. I can not say for sure, but I would guess a full lap around would be about a mile. Looking to take the kids out for some cool water fun? The El Mirage park has a fantastic splash pad too! At night the pad has different colored lights around the fountains. If a relaxing picnic is what your looking for, the park has plenty of grills and a few covered shelters. Don't forget to bring Fido either!  The park has a very nice dog park for your furry friend to stretch their paws and mingle with other K9s.  The place is usually pretty busy at night during the warmer months so although parking usually is not a problem you still may want to get there early.

It only took one time for this fun little sandwich crafter to get on my must do when in...list!  The menu offer a nice verity of stuffed sandwiches, beverages, and deserts!  I took the Western for a spin, and was blown away!  You get your choice of thick sliced fresh baked breads, tons of gooey, melty, delicious cheese, grilled green chillies, and a small side salad.  I can say without hesitation that this was the best grilled cheese I have ever consumed!  The peach tea was my beverage of choice, and it was just as good!  My only wish for this place would be that it was located closer to my home!  On second thought...my doctor might disagree.  Great food, real reasonable prices for the high quality, and the typical friendly folks of Wickenburg make this a must stop!

Sometimes you just don't know how bad a dentist is until you give another one a try.  That was the situation I was in, and boy am I glad I was.  I hit the dentist jackpot in giving Martineau Dentistry a try.  Since my initial cleaning, I have had three wisdom teeth extracted and a crown.  After each one I had no pain in either my mouth or wallet!  I was never pressured into unnecessary work, or told one thing only to "find" something else in mid drilling.  The very caring staff went out of their way to make sure I was up to speed on post procedure care too.  I sincerely can not say enough good things about Martineau! Great care and reasonable honest prices make me a happy patient with an improved smile! :)

I want to like and support the local merchant every chance I get! However in the case of Basha's Surprise location it is not easy.   The layout of the store is odd depending on the entrance you use. Why the produce is all the way on the opposite side, the dairy and frozen section are split up. Their selection has always been good, but price wise I've almost always found them higher then Fry's down the road. Two high points are their fresh made to order pizza and bakery departments!   All in all go for the pizza and baked goods, but go to Fry's for the rest.

I am by no means a fast food fan.  That being said, I really wish we had Farmer Boys down here in Phoenix area of Arizona!  On a recent trip back from Vegas, my wife and I decided to grab a quick inexpensive lunch off the strip before making our way back to AZ.  A quick search on Yelp took us here.  I went with one if the best tasting, freshest burgers I've had in a long long time!  The Barn Burner.  The beef tasted of higher quality, as did the jalapeño slices, lettuce, onion, and bun.  The fries too were perfectly crispy, just the way I like them.  The total for two burger combos came to under $20 too.  I've never known anyone happy to leave more money behind in Sin City, so this too had me walking away happy.  Overall, I will be hitting this place up again on my next trip to LV, but hope one day soon F.Bs open up closer to me in the 602!

A trip to Westgate is never complete without a stop to Ocean Blue! I always attempt to try two different types of frozen yogurt, and top them with some cookie dough and peanut butter. The only limit to the tasty combinations is your imagination! They do a good job rotating the types of frozen yogurt, and sorbets, and the topping bar is always fresh and interesting. Whenever I make a treat they end up being fairly big, and yet the price always seems smaller then I figure. You pay per ounce, and can taste test all the yogurts and sorbets before you start to build your delicious treat!

My 2 1/2 year old son has come here twice this year.  Once for a finger that got a door closed on it, and another for a respiratory issue and 103.4 fever.  The two times were both towards the time they open, and so the wait time wasn't bad at all.  Everyone from the front desk to the X-ray tech, to the Doctor was pleasant and helpful.  My only wish was that they had perhaps some toys or something more to keep kids entertained.  That said they do play movies on the TV and have tons of books.  Nobody likes having a sick child in need of relief overnight or on a holiday, but this is a fantastic resource!

Just like Mister Wolfleys' hometown of Orchard Park, NY, Wolfley's Grill is classy, friendly, and experts on good food!  If delicious wings, or burgers and a few various games are what you look for in a night out, you've found your home!  The average price for a sandwich or wings is about $9 too.  Our group found the quality of ingredients in the meals to be excellent.  Throw in a great location right off the 101 in Desert Ridge, and Wolfley's Grill takes the prize!  Now go give the place a try!

My experience with Legends can best be described as above and beyond!  When a Dodge Neon had an encounter with my garage door early one late December morning I thought I was screwed!  When I noticed Legends had some great reviews, and was a local company in Surprise, I knew they could save the day.  The call was placed a little before 8am and my dented panels were good as new by 3:30pm the same day.  The fact that the panels were fixed, everything was well greased and lubed, and the bill came in at $85 blew my mind.  The fast, friendly, high quality, and reasonably priced repair turned my day around.  In a perfect world garage doors never break, but this isn't a perfect world.  If you find yourself in need of repair or replacement Legends Garage Door is only a call away.

This is MY Fry's!  I love this place.  It's almost exactly one mile from my house, well stocked, clean, friendly, and I can get in and out fast when time is short. I also have found some great deals on household items on the marketplace side. The fact that I end up with weekly discounts (usually .10 cents) on gas is just the cherry on top.

Made an appointment to get my windshield fixed.  I had a good sized chip right square in the middle of my driver side line of sight.  I was offered a fill in fix, but was told I would still see a mark where the chip was.  My insurance company agreed to replace the windshield and all would be good.  So I thought.  In order to have the windshield replaced I would have to make yet another appointment later in the week and come back.  If they steer their customers into getting a replacement they should be able to finish the job the first time.  I refuse to waste another day with this place and will be going to a competent repair shop to get the job done.

If Hawaiian food is what you crave, Leo's is THE place to go!  I've been to the islands and can honestly say, this is as good as it gets!!!  You cant go wrong with anything on their menu.  However if your new to Hawaiian I'd recommend trying either the Kalua pork, or the chicken Katsu.  All meals come with 2 scoops of steamed white rice, steamed cabbage, and macaroni salad.  In terms of price...my wife and I had the above mentioned meals along with 2 drinks.  The total came in UNDER $19!!!  You just can't go wrong at Leo's!!!  Well maybe you can, but it will cost you a hell of a lot more, and you'll need 6 hours to fly there!

The Dawgfather is a fun little hot dog joint everyone should give a try! My wife and I went in on a couple of Groupon offers for here, and from the sounds of things, a lot of others did too! We decided to drop by on a Saturday afternoon and were quickly greeted with a hello and hearty menu. This place has regional dogs from all over the nation. Picking out the right dog for you is simply a matter of taste! Taste being the key since they only use high quality meat and toppings. Price wise the dogs and sides are reasonable too. I went with a couple of Coney dogs, and my wife tried a Philly Dog. The Conies were $3.89ea and the Philly was just under $5. $5 may sound high for a dog, but again you can expect high quality Philly steak on top. The chili, cheese, and onions on my Coney dog were fresh and packed each bite with flavor. On the side we decided to split an order of tots ($2). Unlike some places that serve tots, these were light, crispy, lightly salted, and actually tasted like potato! My only complaints were with the parking and drink prices. Parking can be a challenge if Central Ave has any significant traffic. You have to back out onto Central when leaving. My other complaint is the price of drinks. This is more personal preference then reality. They only serve cans and bottles of soda. We went with bottles of soda at a cost of $1.79 each. Overall this little gem will certainly be a place I'll visit again and again

I had the pleasure of purchasing my home from a lady who was perhaps the worst DIYer ever!    My walk-in shower drain was at one time fixed, but never reconnected properly.  This would obviously allow water to drip down and fall on the ceiling above our living room.  Over time as more water dripped down, a water mark formed.  I immediately called Amigo and they were out to my home in Surprise the next day after work at 5pm.  The two gentleman who came out did a great job fixing the pipe, and drain grate.  When it came to the cleanup they did an amazing job, and couldn't be happier.  The price was not only fair, but with the Yelp deal ($59 gets you $100 off), well below what I expected the total to be.    I really do t hope to have another plumbing problem, BUT if I do, I will make my first call to Amigo! Every aspect of the service exceeded my expectation.  I also want to thank Yelp for saving me $41.

One of the slowest "fast food" experiences I have seen.  The staff couldn't try any harder not to look more uninterested in serving the customers either.  The food however is pretty tasty for a burger joint, and the prices are what you would expect from a casino.  You can do better, but if a burger and fries are what you crave.  This is as good as it gets.

My family and I really enjoy this fun little shop!  Frozen yogurt shops are all over, but this place is different.  They have a few TVs going with movies for the kids.  Cool race car tables and seats for the adults.  I think they have the other shops in Surprise beat in terms of the variety of flavors, but lack a little in the toppings realm.  Overall this is still a great little shop and always my first choice when the FroYo bug bites!

Top notch quality chicken strips!  I became a fan after the first yummy sauced chick strip hit my lips!  The closest I can describe their special sauce is a pepper ranch.  The sweet tea is to die for, and the slaw and Texas toast is as good as the rest if not a hair better.  I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful too.  The only reason why I went four and not five stars is grease.  My strips, although delicious, were just a bit greasier than I would have liked.  Overall though I would love to see a  location in Surprise.

A good test of Chinese buffets are their quality towards the end of the day. This place took the golden crab leg!!! Their selection was a mile long, top quality taste, and attentive and quick drink refills. My only complaint was that their desert plates and ice cream bowls weren't replenished as promptly as I'd like, and ice cream toppings are limited to chocolate syrup and rainbow sprinkles. Overall though, you will enjoy this new member to the Surprise community!!!

Today was the first time my 2 1/2 year old son and I visited the indoor playground/cafe , and were happy we did!  We normally venture over to the east side of town on the weekend when my little guy needs to do what 2 year olds do best, be WILD!  This place was a few dollars more $10, but much closer to home.  Overall the place was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, but most important of all...Collin had ton of fun!  If he had to vote for one thing specifically, he would pick the slides.  My only lacking is that I noticed a few kids a bit older and rougher then the average.  If you keep an eye on your tot this shouldn't be an issue.  We certainly will be back!

My favorite park in the west valley!  Plenty to do for kids (my son is 2), and adults.  The playground area is huge, and well maintained.  The lake area is relaxing and clean.  There is plenty of free parking, and always well organized during community events.  This park is a gem, and a great place to spend the day.

I've heard all the hype about JJ's for a few months now.  In need of lunch I figured this would be a good time to give them a shot!  Why not I thought, a good number of people I know tried them and thought they were good.  This should be a pretty safe bet.  Strike 1 - Complete confusion with my order of two subs on-line!  They promote the fact you can order on-line, but whats the point if it takes three employees who ask what your name is 5 times!  Strike 2 - The fresh baked French bread was rock hard, and had no flavor what so ever.  You should promote fresh baked bread, if it comes off as being a few days old.  Strike 3 - The sub was named Smoked Ham Club.  If you use the word "smoked" to describe the ham that is used, it should have a smoked flavor!  In actuality, you will get the saltiest lowest quality tasting ham that can be sold.  My only hope for this franchise is that other locations have a much higher standard.  If this is how every location is quality wise,  JJ's will not last very long in the Valley.

Friendly, fast, and good!  I've never had to wait that long (even with decent number of people ahead of me).  They always have a smile, and like to chat while they work.  However not the annoying mindless chit chat that can be awkward.  The biggest and best reason. I can give to go here is that I've never walked away with a crooked or defective haircut!    As an added bonus, their prices are very reasonable!  $16 for a tradition adult cut.  Not too shabby!

I'm just not impressed enough to make shopping here a regular event.  The store is clean, layout is well organized, and the bulk section is interesting.  I do like the fact you can make your own peanut / almond butter.  However I am a big time hater of places not accepting credit cards!  I was also not blown away by the prices.  Sure some of the items I buy were anywhere from a dime or less cheaper, but some actually cost more then Fry's.  The big savings was in their off brand stuff.  However I don't care how much cheaper some stuff is, I will never buy certain things made in Mexico!  The quality is just too low.  All in all this place should be able to survive in the ultra competitive Metro Phoenix market, but they won't be a leader.  They are in the Walmart & Food for less boat.

Dr.  Young and his staff have everything my wife and I look for in a pediatric doctor for our 18 month old son.  Everyone we saw was pleasant, patient and caring!  The one particular aspect that we liked was the fact that Dr.  Young always has shown confidence in every approach in treating our son.  His last pediatrician would leave you guessing at times if he indeed knew the treatment/advice he was the best.  Toss in fantastic later office hours and a convenient location near our home, and we have a winner!  It is never fun looking for the perfect pediatrician, but Dr. Young put an end to our search after just one visit!

In my opinion, Lee Lee's is king of the Valley Oriental markets.  That said, LF's is my 1B.  LF's has a nice selection of produce, seafood/fish, beverages, and everything else you can think of that an Oriental market would offer.  The prices I find are competitive, and overall appearance very clean.  Competition is a good thing and LF's is a winner.

Good prices for gas, ice cold drinks, plenty of quick snacks, and easy to get in and out of from Grand Ave.

Don delivers!!!  We went to him to do our rather complex 2013 taxes.  To be honest, we were expecting to have to owe Uncle Sam.  When all was done, we ended up getting a small refund!  Yes, he is busy and can take a while to do the job.  However he always answered our questions, and finished the job exactly when he said he would.  When it comes to things I'm not an expert in, I always go to someone who is an expert.  Don exceeded our expectations, and has earned our future tax and business needs.  Skip the computer software and go see Don!

5 days it takes this lethargic water company to turn our water on in our new home in Surprise!  If you do have to deal with their customer service reps, you will see the perfect example of a company with no standards.

Came here the Friday morning after Christmas, and it wasn't too busy.  Parking wasn't an issue at all.  I like the layout and early store offerings.  Although several spaces have yet to open, they look to be ready soon.  I found some decent prices at  Just Sports and a few shoe stores too.  This place is worth a shot in place of the long drive to the other Outlets around the Valley.

Freddy's is a typical Midwestern style burger joint.  I'd say the closest comparison is Culver's.  The burgers although very tasty and not overly greasy, are wafer thin.  If you are hungry, make sure you go with at least a double because of this.  The fries are shoestring thing and seasoned well, but perhaps the saltiest I've ever had, EVER!  The thing that bumps this place up from a three star to a four is their frozen custard.  They have tons of varieties, and so far the ones I've tried are amazing!  As for prices.  The burger combos run between $6-$8, and although delicious, small frozen custard treats will cost you about $4.  All and all I like this place a bit more than the others, but just wish they would cut their use of salt on their fires by 50%!

I understand that sometimes restaurants have bad or off days.  They are run by people, and from time to time it happens.  Tonight however was a disaster!    First off if you have a young child like my family does, you may have to have them sit in your lap.  As you see, they have only three highchairs!  The staff also seemed to initially care less, as the lady who sat us instantly went back to stand at her station and never even mentioned they had no chairs, or that it might be a while.  The food was also not even up to par to earn a three yelp star.  I tried a little bit of a wide verity, and found a common theme.  Nothing was hot, and at best warm.  If you are a fan of certain Chineese buffett staples, you may be disappointed.  General Tsao chicken for example can not be found here.  Lastly the ice cream tasted as if it were left over from the old Furrs days.  I wished this place invested in the resources to have a chance, but I just can't see them lasting past summer.  If the health inspector don't shut them down, the low quality food certainly will!

Fantastic burgers, pretty good not overly salty BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, and delicious regular and sweet potato fries are just a few of the reasons this place has joined my regular visit list.  Some other reasons I enjoy this place so much is a great happy hour, a whiskey as far as the eye can see, and an outgoing staff that shows pride in their establishment.  I did seem to notice the food on my last few visits to be a bit on the greasy side.  That is is the some reason I am giving The Haymaker 4 our of 5 stars.  Overall this is a place you go to if a good meal, at a reasonable cost in a comfortable relaxed atmosphere is what you desire.

There isn't a lot I can add that other recent reviews hasn't touched on already.  I went with the large turkey ham club sub.  I expected much more for $15.  I counted two slices of ham, two slices of turkey and one slice of provolone cheese.  The lettuce was fresh and the roll light and tastes, but that's it.  I don't see and real reason I would go back to this location, or any other for that matter.  I'm left wondering what exactly did I pay for? Light Italian style bread and a little lettuce for $15 I guess sums it up.

My 3 1/2 year old had seen all the indoor play places around the Valley, and this place is near the top of his list.  It's clean, well maintained, the toys are in great shape, and there is a wide verity.  His top three is the Roller Coaster, Big Slide, and Thomas The Train ride.  As for my (the parent) perspective.  The price is right and it isn't a long drive from where I live in Surprise when you take the 303.  Overall when the temps hit triple digits and the little ones are climbing the walls, this place is a great prescription!

The Curb has potential to become a worthwhile store if your in the market for appliances, home furnishing, TVs, and even sporting goods.  The main problem with the business is they don't seem prepared and organized well enough to take on the current customer load, let alone any future growth.  The items seem to be grouped well enough, but the flow feels like they didn't think the foot traffic out well enough.  Parking is another example of this as finding a spot just before noon was almost impossible.  I ended up parking in the street next to one of several "No Parking" signs.  As for the quality of items.  Most everything I looked at seemed to be in decent enough shape that I would buy it.  The prices on some items however seemed a bit on the high side for exactly what you are getting.  TVs for example I would touch with a 40 foot pole!  Window blinds on the other hand seemed fairly reasonable.  I hope this is just a growing pains, working the kinks out phase they are going through. I probably will give them another shot in about six months or so, but coming all the way from Surprise, I would need to see noticeable improvement to become a semi regular shopper.

Having walked by a few times before and after Arizona Coyotes, this place caught my interest.  On a recent Friday morning, I decided to treat my mom on her birthday to one of these delicious rings of goodness.  We got three donuts to split (S'More, OC, and French Toast).  As you can see first hand walking into the establishment, they are fresh, hot, and made to order.  The original pastries were as amazing as they sounded!  Overall, the staff was friendly, helpful, and fast.  The place was clean too, but for as new as it is, you have to expect that.  My brain is telling me we just can't go back, but my stomach is saying, we gotta try the_____.  At a cost of $1.89 per donut, they are on the pricey side, but so worth it.  Do yourself a favor, and cave in to your gut!  May I suggest everything on the menu!

My family has been looking forward to giving this new BBQ restaurant here in Surprise a try for a long time.  After countless delays, and missed opportunities due to the restaurant being closed we had our chance!  Since there are three of us, we decided on the family meal with slaw and beans as sides.  Our first choice was cheesy potatoes, but as often is the case mentioned in other reviews, they were out of something.  Overall I will say the menu is pretty limited, and you shouldn't expect to find the variety you would find at a Rudys, or Honey Bears.  As for the food, put it this way.  We ended up throwing most of everything out and going to plan B.  The positive was the lean quality of the pulled pork.  That's where it ends however.  The meat had absolutely no flavor, the store bought hamburger rolls they give you tasted stale, the BBQ sauce tasted only like ketchup, the beans had no flavor or texture, and the slaw was dry and loaded with ground pepper.  I rate "Got Que? " a two out of five based on the lean quality of the pork and friendly staff.  Overall however I just literally throw $25 in the trash, and just don't see a reason to return.  Sadly, if you want quality "Que", you will have to keep making the drive to outside of Surprise.

Finally something more embarrassing to the city of Glendale than the mayor and city council!  This place is simply not worth your entertainment time and money.    I guess I should point out the two positives before I get to the meat and potatoes.  You will have no problem getting close free parking, and they offer all the water, soda, and coffee you want, free of charge.  Now if you are me, the two main things I look for when the gambling bug bites, is a decent chance to win at times, and alcoholic beverages.  These of course are two things you will NOT find at Desert Diamond.  The establishment has no liqueur license, and since it is not a certified casino, as a gaming hall, your odds are based on the other players and not the house.  You will also be consumed by smoke as this is a smoking friendly gaming hall.  I just can not see this place lasting long with the tarnished reputation they have so soon after their doors swung open.  You will find more entertainment and better odds, going across the street to Westgate and throwing your coins in the main fountain.

I was looking for a new landscaper for my backyard, and found a Acme Lawn Care flyer taped to my front door.  I should have kept right on walking to the recycling bin and thrown out the advertisement.  This company did an awful job on every aspect of job.  My grass was cut so low it died, my fruit trees were hacked so bad I'm not sure they will make it, and on top of that, I could branches everywhere!  I thought one of the major points in landscaping was to clean up when the job is done.  When I made mention of my dissatisfaction, I was told everything is normal, and this was a tough job.  In reality I should have just done it myself!    This company apparently is so amazing in landscaping, that they also dabble in pool maintenance.
