I am one of those people with the whole "don't come near my eyes, don't touch them, don't put drops in, no I wont cooprerate" kind of people. Just a thing with me ever since I was a kid. These guys were great. Office staff was great. The gentlemen who scheduled my appointment was awesome, the lady who greeted me was awesome and everyone was so friendly. I saw Dr. Van Over and she was friendly, patient and completely understood by anxiety and did not make me feel bad about it at all. I know I am an adult, just the unknown makes me anxious and she made me feel comfortable and we were even able to laugh about things. She didn't pressure me into doing anything I didnt want to do.   Only recommendation I do have, is the first initial 3 eye tests you do before you see the doctor, there needs to be a little more explaining on what's going to happen (especailly the eye pressure test which i hate). The machine is automated, and I didn't know that. Usually a little warning is nice, but explain that it is automated and there is no contorl so then I can expect it and work with it.  Other than that, I had a blast. Got a killer new pair of glasses, had fun picking them out and I will absolutely recommend this place to anyone. I plan on having my Mom go see them as well.

It is right across the street from where I work. Everyone is always so friendly and nice. The food has always been perfect and have amazing chocolate chip cookies. It's nice having a little local place such as this.

Let me start by saying I cannot ride a bike. My physical disability in my legs don't allow me. For long distance walking, standing, etc, I use a wheelchair. My wheelchair  just like bike tires, air filled, etc. Well, I had a flat this week. I went to another shop in Chandler and I have ALWAYS been disappointed with this other shop. Just not friendly, and always expecting me to "know things" already. Well, this other place didn't have my tubes but had some thinner ones that would work, but risk of going flat easier. I got them, I needed my chair! That was Wednesday 11/27. I used the chair twice. Once indoors, and then today 11/29 to wheel 1/4 a mile. BOTH went flat as quick as you can say FLAT. So upset. So I looked for a new place. I found this place and decided to give it a try.  From the second I walked into Performance, me and my partner were greeted with smiles, took their time to direct me where I needed to go. I met Jason in the service department. He took AMAZING care of us! He answered all our questions, didn't rush me, didn't make me feel stupid for not knowing all about wheels and tubes, and helped get exactly what I need, and EVEN something better so help better protect me. I spent LESS $$ here, got something BETTER than the other place. I am SO thankful to have found such a great place willing to help me out and deliver awesome customer service.   I may not be able to ride a bike, but I WILL recommend this place to everyone and I WILL be back to have my wheels services here!!

I really don't want to rank a 2, but I have just had it. I love this location and especially with the drive through. Peak times are HORRIBLE at this place with the layout of the parking lot and drive through (not their fault through), but other times its okay. I have noticed this location is starting to have a LOT of quick turn over. We came here for so long and got to know everyone but each time I go in while is 4 or more times a month, always different people. always friendly though! I do give a 4 star for customer service.   But I am rating 2 stars for the drinks. I went in today (drive through) and got my usual today, a tall Mocha frap with whip. It tasted horrible. It seems like that EVERY TIME I come to this one, they make my drink differently. They never follow the same process or didn't wash out the blender container. I was a good mile or more away this morning running to another errand before I REALLY got into my drink to notice and I was NOT turning back around. I shouldn't have to turn around and walk in just to get a common drink re-made. It is just so frustrating. I have had to go back multiple times to get drinks remade at this location. I am just over it. I respect Starbucks as a company and commend their efforts and service, but I am starting to get the feeling that they are loosing their values because they are such a huge name and staple in our modern day and society. I really hope they get back on track. I am to the point of wanting to find local shops and support them instead.

I have been here a few times, and each time the food always has been good! This past Friday, my partner and I were in the mood for some good wings and the reviews on their wings here drew us there. We went on a Friday night after we saw a movie. I like that this place is not too big, but very comfortable and awesome atmosphere. They do have an awesome selection of beers and a good menu. It is bar food for sure, but delicious.   We both had an order of 10 bone in wings, regular buffalo and were nice and tangy, the way we like it. Next time I am going to try a little hotter. The wings were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, nice and hot on the inside. The ranch, DELICIOUS. Blue Cheese, good but not my favorite. I prefer other blends, but I know some people will like it. It's just my personal preference that I didn't enjoy it as much as others.   We also split their version of a pub salad. It was huge and perfect to It's split. Fresh ingredients! We enjoyed that very much.   I did not let our service affect our rating, but when we went, the server wasn't the most friendly. Was not warm and welcoming at all. Kinda rude in the beginning but he changed up his attitude and got better. Everyone has an off day so I don't want to let the service affect my rating because we WILL go back.   It is nice to have a "hole the wall" type bar close to home. We are not sports fans, but we like the people and atmosphere, beer and food. just overall a neat place and look forward to going back!

This two star review is ONLY FOR THEIR SERVICE. I give their food 4 stars, however I cannot go any higher in my opinion because of their service. When I was a kid, I grew up on Garcias. It was on Alma School just north of Warner. It is a childhood favorite. When they closed, we didn't go to any other one for quite some time. About a year ago, we found out there is one by us here in south Chandler and were very excited!!  Each and every time we come here, the service is just terrible. I don't understand. From today, we have been a total of 4 times in the past year. Every time, horrible service. The hostesses are not friendly. They are so bland and so unexcited about their job. You don't feel welcome. They always feel bored.   Every server we have had doesn't listen to us, unfriendly, feel likes we are bugging them when we are just simply providing our drink order. Food has been wrong because they didn't listen. Slow. Cannot handle more than one table at a time and just really take away from the experience. It is really sad. No one is happy there and it is a poorly run restaurant.   I do have to compliment their food. AMAZING food. BEST shrimp tacos. My Mom has been eating them for years. Generous chips and salsa, great on the refills and just overall good food. Their environment is very comfortable and very open. It is a fun place to be. Just a drab with their people.  Most people would never come back. However, it is a place we enjoy so I am sure we will eat in again, however I think we will mostly just call in our order and do take out to avoid the bad service. I truly hope they see what is wrong and ramp up this place. It could be a lot better in this awesome part of town!

I love trying new places and was excited to try this place, but I was very disappointed, as well as a few people from our party. My sister likes this place for happy hour with drinks and such, but we sat in the dining room. The hostess said they didnt have time to set up our table so they just brought silver ware on napkins and set it down. I thought that was kind of rude but all is good. Just simply my opinion.  Chips, salsa and bean dip, FABULOUS. Absolutely delicious. I enjoy great starters like that.  It was a Saturday night so they were busy but the place was not packed and there was no wait or line to sit. Our server was really nice, but she was so slow. Serving and having that nack for it is an art, but it is teachable. My family has been servers and in the industry for years so we understand the gist of it. She probably did not get proper training because she was so unorganized, and it took multiple questions and attempts for her to follow though to bring us anything before she took off running before we were even done talking. She was really nice and I know she is trying to make ends meet, but the service was bad.  Mom had the chicken chimichunga. It was under cooked, flat and absolutely tasteless. I split the carne asada burrito with my partner. I enjoyed it, but the steak (in my opinion) was too big. I am used to it being cut up smaller, but it was hardly stuffed with steak and it was flat. Rice and beans were pretty good, but overall dinner was very disappointing. I felt horrible that night and was bloated. My system just did not agree.  Overall, the evening was not bad. Just frustrating with the lack of service, and so-so quality of the food. You could tell the restaurant was very unorganized and no one knew what was going on. There was a table of 6 who left about 30 minutes after we got there, (they were done) and it took over 20+ minutes for the table to even get cleaned and reset while I watched a part of 6 or 7 sit up front for over 20 minutes, and there were some other free tables. We also watched food get brought to the wrong table over 3 times. So even though we were in our own world, seeing all this took away from the experience.  I am not sure if I recommend this place or not. I felt horrible after I ate there but I may give them another shot in the future. I was only here once, but to me, first impressions are everything. They are in a great location and I hope they read these and will work on improving their food and system of running the restaurant.

I gave it 4 starts ONLY because of the food, NOTHING else. If the service, restaurant decor etc was good too, it would have 5 starts. 5 Starts for food, 2 stars for service, and 2 for restaurant overall. I never been here until some co workers told me about it. I went the 1st time with some co workers. a good party of 8 people. I read other review, it looks like an italian restaurant. You could tell they did nothing well at all to open it. Lobby is TINY. Decor sucks. dining room too quiet and full with no music, TV or anything. Silence. Food was GREAT! Warning though, everything is really spicy!! but it is so good. LOVE the salsa. i had a red chile burrito with chicken, AMAZING. i wish I had more rice on the plate, but good. Still have their weird "temp" menu, but still good choices.   I just went again last night with my partner. The waiter who was also the bartender, I believe ignored us because he went to a table of 4 before us and we were way before. the bus boy took care of us, beginning to finish. the bartender, waiter guy came over once to see if we were doing okay and we said yes so thats how I could tell he was supposed to take care of us. He asked if the other guy helped us. a few younger "servers" walk around there with shorts, toms and side way hats. I like the casual atmosphere of staff, but when you have no personality and no interest in helping, it doesnt make it more fun.   Come here for the food, NOT the service. it lacks really quite a bit. No one was rude, just are bland as a robot.   Looking forward to going back. I may try the PHX or Alma School one to compare.

I am so thankful to have found the Art of Touch. Christine is so friendly, such positive energy, and amazing knowledge for the healing I am seeking. I live in Chandler and this will be a place that I will drive too anytime. I look forward to getting a set plan in place. She does not mess around. If you need healing, she is the place! Don't miss out! Btw, neatest office space and atmosphere ever!

I have gone back and fourth on this one a lot and I felt I should just put my thoughts out there. I had the opportunity to upgrade to a slightly larger apartment in my complex back in 2014. First floor to second. I am physically disabled and am not able to move a lot of large and heavy items, especially up stairs. My partner was in the process of starting a new job and all these other moving companies wanted asinine rates to move in the SAME complex. I found this company on Thumbtack who provided me a quote. I called, set up and appointment and the owner came to visit. A VERY, VERY nice man. Very kind, listened to me, took a look at what we would be moving and provided me a quote. A quote at a VERY reasonable amount. I decided to go with him and booked it. I booked him easily a month in advance.   I am very peculiar about things. I wanted the move to be as smooth as possible and easy for them as well so we could just get it done. I had so much to finish that day to begin with, I just wanted to be said and done. I had everything boxed up, everything OUT in our dining room (except for bed, dresser, those understandable items). Not one thing was left out or something extra they had to do. Just out the dining room, through the door and to the truck.  Moving day, showed up an hour late. We had either a 7 or 8am appt, I don't remember. I waited till it was about 30 mins past the appointment and I FINALLY get a text after not answering my call and said will be there soon, another 30 minutes and still no show. Finally, an hour after appointment they showed. I was quoted and promised 3 guys, only 2 showed up. I did NOT get an apology (even though I was up at 6am to ENSURE everything was ready for them and ended up waiting). I got some sort of "well you know how it is, had a few drinks...." To me that is not a professional response. Any who, they did get right to work. They busted and got the truck loaded I believe in 90 mins or less truthfully. They moved and got it in. We made it to the new place which took all of 90 seconds to drive too and they immediately started unloading. Now, my complex has a 180 degree turn around at the landing so it does make things tricky for the bigger items. They did move up everything fast. However, one guy hurt himself on my couch DUE to being heavy and a reclining sofa (which was told during the initial quote appointment) and not having their 3rd guy. It didn't stop them.  This is where I got super frustrated. Now, I admit this IS MY FAULT. I SHOULD have asked in the beginning before I agreed to hire them. THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH. I need to point that out as I did NOT have enough cash on me and was planning on paying with a credit card until my cash came in a few days later. This is NOT listed on their website and this information was not made known to me upfront. It was 2014 when we moved. A "professional" business should be able to accept cards, or at least tell the customers to keep in mind so they are prepared. I know if I ran my own business and wanted to be paid for the job, I would make important things like that known. I was able to write a check thankfully so that was not a problem, but had to move some things around pretty fast to be safe.   Overall: nothing was damaged. We had one or 2 minor scuffs on something coming UP, but my stairs with that turn at the landing is evil and I COULD NOT do it better myself if I tried. They cleaned up and all is fine. They were VERY friendly, and very fast. They did not mess around when they were here. There was NO hidden charges and what he quoted me is what he charged. Now, next time I move I will ensure I get it on a form or in writing to be safe. I learned a lot from this experience. But I did not get scammed out of any money.   To end, would I personally use them again? No. Just the being late, no apology or respect for my time even though I respected theirs, and the curve ball of ONLY accepting cash, that was enough dings for me. It really stressed me out in a time of big stress already and did not appreciate that. I only recommend that if you hire, just proceed with caution. That is all. Again, the owner is very nice. Just ensure you ask questions, get it in writing and cover your basis. I learned my lesson.

I just went to this office for my first visit and I was VERY impressed. I had to switch dentists and I was nervous to find someone new. I was warmly greeted in a beautiful office and we were given a tour of the facility. My dental hygienist was SUPER friendly, super gentile and I was not judged by her or anyone. I was completely at ease and was a quick experience.  Dr. Davis was just as friendly, just as gentile and I felt I trusted him very much. I am pleased to have found someone so close to home!! I would absolutely recommend him.

Just had our first rounds of wings last night! We did not go in, my brother brought them home for a family dinner we were having. We had the ATL, Citrus Chipotle and Garlic Parmesan and they were to die for. I am a wing fanatic. I love them very much. I was pleased to see they were BIG, plump and crispy. Some other places we go, I feel we get skimped out on these mini wings that don't fill you up and are not worth the price.  This place is NOT that place. My brother and sister in law go every week now and are hooked. My Mom who is a picky eater even loved them. I cannot wait to go back and try again!

So I pass this place all the time. I was happy to see a new place take over the space. Well, on a whim, I decided to go here with a couple friends to try something new. Beautiful restaurant interior and atmosphere. Big and you don't feel crowded or that people are eavesdropping into your conversation. I had a WONDERFUL server that far exceeded our expectations. Chips and salsa, plain amazing! The food portions were HUGE, and for a great price in my opinion. I got a combo and I had so much, I had lunch for the next day at work. I got to try my friends dishes and they were nothing short of delicious. That is passionate food right there. I cannot wait to go back. In these times, I don't usually do 5 stars, but we just had such a blast and was so surpised at the quality of the food and presentation, they deserve it.

I LOVE this place. I carpool into work with my partner so a lot of days, I do not have the car on me. This place delivers all the time to the building I work in. I work in a building with a lot of employees so they do come here a lot. They are ALWAYS SO friendly and so quick. The food is always delicious and I think their prices are VERY fair and you get an excellent serving size. Delivery is always quick and SUPER friendly. I always meet Maria the Manager and she is SO KIND hearted and ALWAYS has a smile on her face. Me and my colleagues love to order here and they are a life saver in my situation. Lots of different choices to suit different tastes and moods. HIGHLY recommend!

I have only been here once and I will absolutely update my review if I decide to go back, but I was truly disappointed with this place. I heard from a few co-workers that this place was AMAZING. However, then went to the San Tan location. When we found out this place opened up a mile from our house, we were super excited to try it.   We went on a Friday afternoon at about 430 and it was dead. No customers. Not a problem for us as we like hidden gems and don't like crowds. We weren't greeted when we came in but that's okay as it is not a huge deal to me but it was kind of awkward with all employees there and no direction to help us as this was our first time. The lady we had in the line was SUPER friendly and was very willing to help us.   I decided on the burrito, and I got it enchilada style. Like other reviews, people said their food was wrong but mine was NOT. she was very patient with me, explained things and ensure I had the right choice in mind before she made it. Burrito was HUGE and plenty. Could have fed two people. My partner got the enchiladas.  Fast forward, we did get one chips and salsa to split and two drinks. Total? $37. I nearly fell out of my chair. I really should have looked over the receipt for issues, but they DO nickel and dime you like crazy. I can get the same at Chipotle for $22 or less for two people. That kinda irked me.   Also, during the making process, they did not offer a lot of "customizable" options as I guess I am used too. I am not trying to compare, but there were other things however I did not know about and would have liked but didn't know I could. And we found out, those "minor extras" that we could get else where without being charged, they charged there. It was a little ridiculous.   The food itself was okay. I didn't like their medium green sauce. My stomach didn't like it either. Not their fault, just my taste buds. Their regular salsa was delicious. They did not have a hot sauce. We asked for a hotter salsa and the one they said we had was their hot. It wasn't. It was the same version of Chipotle's medium. Okay, that bugged me a little. Maybe some sour cream? Nope extra. Ugh. defeated.  They had unlimited Horchata which was AWESOME. It was pretty delicious. Environment was nice. Tables little too close for comfort and would not be fun when the place is busy.   Overall, it was not BAD, however just the flavors in my opinion did not mesh well and I had a HORRIBLE stomach ache for a day after. Just didn't agree with me. My partner liked them. He had no complaints on his enchiladas, however he said it wasn't enough to swing on back.  Again - I need to maybe give them another shot. If I do, I will get something smaller. It's just I feel like I have to get small so I don't spend almost $40 on something I am truly not happy with. We will see. I will stick with Chipotle for now.
