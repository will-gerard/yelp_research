Absolutely beautiful property!  Now that they have been renovated, I am going to frequent the property every year. By far my favorite Hyatt to date. Their rooms are large and their balcony is the biggest yet! They offer a table you can enjoy breakfast at and two lounge chairs to tan on (If it isn't scorching hot).  They have 20+ pools. One of them is a beach pool that has sand entering the pool which I think is pretty awesome, they have a great grotto, and the COOLEST WATER SLIDE EVER! You go like a million miles per hour and basically fly off of the slide so hold on to your swimsuit! Ha! And did I mention the pools are open 24/7?? YES 24/7! How awesome is that?!  Now don't let me forget about their Front Desk and Pool staff. All of them were smiling and very helpful. Upon check-in we were offered Prickly Pear margaritas that were not stingy on the alcohol and full of flavor. Loved them!  I can say so many great things about this property, but of course you just have to experience it for yourself. Enjoy!

You started off so well.... I thought we could start a relationship out of this, but I guess not. Web ordering my marketplace turkey sandwich, I clearly asked for no tomatoes. The girl behind the intercom even repeated this back to me. But of course what happens? I get my sandwich and on it are three red tomatoes slices. I know I sound like a brat. I simply took the tomatoes off, but its the principle and quite simple to follow.

Holy smokes what a welcome! Thanks to Mariana for getting our visit started off right. She opened the door for us and began to ask us the usual questions "how are you doing tonight?" And "have you dined with us before?". When I said we haven't been there before, she quickly became interested and gave us some great recommendations as well as explaining that its a build your own pizza type place.  When Joanna (our waitress) took over, we were ready to order since Mariana familiarized us so well. We decided on a traditional antipasto that had the best mozzarella and delicious peppers. Then went for the small (which is huge) pesto pizza, that comes with the mozzarella. We then decided to add artichokes, mushrooms, pepperoni, and half traditional sauce since my friend doesn't like pesto. The pizza was made quickly in a cool coal oven and had an overload of garlic (just the way I like it). It truly was absolutely delicious and everyone was so pleasant. Thank you for treating us well!

The service here was horrible. Homeboy was giving dirty looks and staring off at God knows what the entire time. I guess the kids behind counter were so preoccupied with how long the line was getting, they decided to quickly make my Mint Oreo blizzard crappie. So the outcome was more of your typical Oreo blizzard with random tastes of the mint flavored syrup. Yuck.

So good! The perfect dining when you don't want to spend too much money while on vacation. I got the Chicken Shawarma like the waiter recommended and it was great! Definitely a lot more Americanized than your typical Mediterranean restaurants, but I can't complain. The biggest reason why I can't complain? Because their garlic sauce is to die for! Reminds me of the same one I would get back home. That disgustingly stinky, sticks on you for a week, you could probably eat it with a spoon, kind of garlic sauce. Ughhh I could go for some right now. It really makes anything you eat here taste delicious.

"Coffee Bean or Starbucks?" I asked. Both are so close, but it was a quick response and Coffee Bean won! I quickly jerked over to the right lane to order my caramel ice blended coffee (pure deliciousness). Now don't get me wrong... As a gold member with Starbucks for many years, I do love my frappucinos, but there is just something about their ice blended coffees here. Pure crack. It's a nice change from time to time and this particular location had fantastic service! The girl at the drive-thru was extremely patient and even shared a few laughs with me.
