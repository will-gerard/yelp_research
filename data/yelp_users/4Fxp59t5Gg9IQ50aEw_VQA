Ive been a customer of Z Cafe for about six years. Almost two years ago I moved to New Orleans. Im here visiting AZ for a bit and I have been going regularly. The food was already excellent, my favorites are the Godfather and the breakfast burritos. However, Dan has added the best breakfast burrito he has ever made, actually there are two, the Chipotle and the Spicy. The combination of flavors is simply amazing. I have never ever had an average meal here, always A plus. Im so proud to support this place, they deserve the best because they serve the best food. Go there folks.

My friend Tom told me to go there. I didn't think it was gonna be as good as he said it would be, but man Im hooked on this place. The flavor in the food is so unique. The menu has such great variety. I had the Chimichanga Monday, Tuesday, I had the Ribs which were very good. Friday, I had the Beef Medallion with Chipotle Pasta, my Dad had the meatloaf. Their food is incredible. Anyone who doesn't give this place at least 4 stars, has no credibility when it comes to food. It is a 5 in my book. Can't wait to go again soon.

I am from Seattle. I always support the local coffeehouse. Bergies is the best coffee in the Phoenix metro area. Ive been to all the other coffee houses in the area. The quality of their coffee is very high. I know that i do not need to go home to enjoy great coffee. I hope everyone supports Bergies and does not go to the worst coffee ever, Starbucks. They not only sold my Sonics (yes i take it personally), they also serve bitter, bad coffee. Go to Bergies, and you will be satisfied.

This is the best Indian restaurant around. I have been to every Indian restaurant in town. I used to go to Indian Paradise and Guru Palace regularly, then I started going here. This is the only Indian restaurant in Phoenix that uses real lamb, not BEEF (check the texture at other places next time). The flavor is incredible. Most importantly the owners are great people. I have become very good friends with them the past year. I bring all my friends there and they are well taken care of. This is my favorite place to eat. I recommend the Lamb Saag, Lamb Boti Masala, and Lamb Vindaloo with Paneer Naan. Hope to see all of you guys there. You will not be dissapointed.

Average burger, average taste, above average prices. Anyone who thinks this is good food has no credibility when it comes to food. If you want cheap cheese, bland meat, and a lot of grease and want to pay too much this is the place. I go to Columbus OH for work, Graffiti burger is the place over there. They have a big sign over the Five Guys in Columbus. I passed by the Five Guys, almost empty, go to Graffiti, PACKED. There is a reason for that, they serve the best burgers around. I so wish AZ had a place like that. Until that happens, I am in search for the best burger in AZ.

This is one of the worst indian restaurants around. They use cheap quality ingredients. The lamb is actually Beef. Most indian restaurants do that to save money. The food is completely bland. Go to India's Grill for real Indian food. Ive been to all of the valley Indian restaurants, and they are the best.

I have been there many times. At first I wasn't a big fan as I used to regularly go to Cherry back in the day. I wasn't huge on the rock music at first. I like going to places that play rap/hip hop. Recently, the club has changed a lot where they are playing all hip hop, which is great.  Most places in Scottsdale or anywhere else don't play the music I like. Its a good environment to be in. While I certainly respect the opinions of others, I happen to like this place a lot as it is different from a lot of other places out there. Check it out and see for yourself.

This is the best sandwich chain around, hands down. Im not big into chain restaurants, but I like JJ. Their food is good and well priced.

Had the chicken biscuit sandwich, the chicken was fried nicely but there was a lack of gravy and overall the sandwich was very dry. My mom had the benedict, pretty average and the fruit she asked for on the side was old. The banana was super overripe. Also ordered a side of potatoes and they were rubbery. I heard this place used to be good, guess I came a little too late. Super dissapointing experience.

The food just isn't very good. The service is not very good either. However, they find a way to keep the place packed. I just have no motivation to go back and eat there.

I have been a customer of this great place since they first opened their old location in 2009. My Dad and I were regulars there for years. He is no longer around, but I am still a customer forever and everytime I go there I remember the old times I had with my old man. I recently relocated to New Orleans, so I can only eat there a few times a year. However, this clear cut is the best indian food around. I have eaten in California many times. The food is the best. Get the Lamb Boti Masala, Lamb Saag, anything lamb. The Goat is delicious. I am very good friends with the family and they treat all of their customers like family. I have been a regular at every indian restaurant in phoenix, and this clearly trumps them all. You will not be dissapointed coming here. In fact I have about ten friends that are regular customers still.

I visited this place around 2013 when they took over Pasand and I thought it was just average. However the past few months I have been going and have noticed the big increase in quality. The owner is back in control and is making sure that the food is top notch. I go there for lunch every Saturday and its a complete buffet with a lot of variety. Last nite I took my Mom to eat there and she has to eat less salt. The owner waiter and chef made sure they made the food according to her needs. They are very attentive and are open to customer feedback. They have my support and always will. Get the Lamb Pepper Masala, its delicious.

The owners of this chain sure know how to hype up an average tasting burger. The food is not bad nor good, it is just average. Its food you can cook at home. The cheese is that cheap fake cheese, the meat sucks. The price is way too much. Im not a cheap guy, I like spending money on food if it is good, Five Guys simply is not that. Go to another burger place and save your money.

Some of the best indian food I have ever eaten. I loved India Grill and this is about as close as it gets to it. It reminded me of some of the great indian food in Vancouver BC. A lot of value for the weekend buffet. I will be back, great flavor,I enjoyed my lunch.

I just went here Sunday and the buffet was fabulous. Today I went for dinner with the hope of getting the same great food. I ordered the Paneer Pakora and it was tasty. I then ordered the Goat Masala and Aloo Parotha. The other waiter said get garlic naan, I was like Ive been eating this almost all my life I like aloo parotha. You wouldnt think someone who doesnt eat Indian regularly would choose goat right? The Goat was just ok, it was in their words Mild, which is medium to hot spicy. I love spicy so I dont midn but imagine first time indian food eaters. In addition I asked the waiter if there are any dairy free vegan options since I wanted to bring food for my sister. Waiters were very non helpful. They did not check on me once until they brought me the bill. They didnt do the same for the other 3 tables in there. In addition the waiter thought I had ordered another goat which I clearly didnt and when I went to pay upfront (I was tired of waitng for the waiters) the goat I didnt order was still on my bill. I ordered some baked items at the end wanting to order the Golub Jamun but I saw mold all over it. Im not here ot try to put a place out of business but the service tonight was some of the worst I have ever had. I felt very unwelcome the whole time. The food is inconsistent and service was awful but since there is a large Indian following they will do well. No thanks for next time, this was one oft he biggest gut checks Ive ever had when it comes to food. I was looking forward to dinner tonight.

I was expecting really good ice cream. This ice cream is nothing better than what you can buy at any local grocery store. I was extremely dissapointed after having a solid meal at the So Cal Taco place down the road. The best ice cream around is still Jeni's in Columbus OH. I wish they opened in AZ, it would be perfect since I come down here quite often.
