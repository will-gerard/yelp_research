Went to this place on a Wednesday evening. Not to busy....which is always my first concern..but I gave it the benefit of the doubt since growing up this place had great food and service. Well that was shut down real quick.   The service was really good our waitress Ria was super accommodating and agreed with us when we had issues with the food. She really made sure we were getting what we paid for and that our experience was good. However, the issue came along when we ordered the pick two fajitas. Steak and chicken was our choice.   When it came out the server boy or whatever you call him...kept yelling our order like we were incompetent humans and if we didn't answer right away he would get super frustrated and just push our plate in front of someone. He also cussed in front of a table full of children. Mind you there were 8 of us..so patients is the key with big parties everyone knows that. ON top of that the steak was four of the thinnest pieces of steak I have ever seen...it looked like bird food. Here to find out they weigh their food and cheat you out of it...so that's disappointing. I mean this place is no where I will be going back to especially with a person who cusses in front children OVER FOOD!!!! Come on people!  The only reason I would go back is for Ria's service but nothing else.

Went there first time on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch...got the Kung Pao Chicken..it was the BEST I have had in a long time in AZ. It was spicy and authentic which usually it ends up being very fake tasting like Pei Wei...but not this place! Even the Crab Puffs were perfect! Also it was pretty busy for a Friday afternoon at 2, but the service was still great! In addition the prices were remarkable..fed two people with 15 bucks out the door. Bravo Asian Cafe Express...I will definitely be back again!

Went here to go see Finding Dory. Bought tickets online, got there 30 min in advance, got a seat, and was ready to go....only thing that was missing. AIR CONDITIONING!!!! In ARIZONA in June!!!!  That is a crime to sell movie tickets to people and act like nothing is going on. Also, the "manager" was hiding behind the glass ticket booth rather than going and confronting the issue. Worst customer service ever. The only reason I gave it another star was they refunded me my tickets...well almost, short 2 dollars...something about a convenience fee...okay... Sure...real convenient. Good Luck staying in business in Arizona with no air!!
