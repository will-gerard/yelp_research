Best dentist office in Arizona.   Seriously I don't have enough good words to explain dr goodman & his staff.  Compassionate, happy, thoughtful are just a few I could use!  From a cleaning to removal of some baby teeth the assistants hold your hand and reassure you everything is going to be ok.  My daughter (9) hates having teeth removed but knows she is in good hands when I take her in.  She even told me she loves her dentist because he is gentle.  Now that's a winner in my book.

Ordered online... 1.5 hours later they call to get my location.. The driver was no where near my location.  The restaurant offered nothing. 2 hours later the driver gets there with cold food!  I sent it back and got my money back

The food was good but then we ordered ice cream- tony not only didn't turn the machine back to run but helped everyone else in line before even looking at the machine. Sad to not get ice cream because it was going to be another 5 minutes for the machine to wake up and freeze over again. Ugh. Sad... Plus tons of people that don't seem to be the respectable kind- if you catch my drift.

Best cut and color I have had in the 10 years living in Phoenix.  I drove from San tan valley (1hour) just to have Yvonne and Leah do my hair.  I am never going anywhere else again!

Riggs is amazing!  The one and only business or people I will allow in my house without me or a family member there!  Extremely respectful of my space and items.  Joel knows what needs to be done and gets it done. He even locks my dogs outside for me so they won't escape while he cleans the carpets.   Talk about a full service carpet cleaning company!!  He even can get the oil spots out of my carpets in our automotive shops lobby! He's a miracle worker!!!

Went Wednesday night about 745pm- while my food tasted ok, my daughter had the crab and was sick.... Yep 12 hours later total food poisoning.   Very sad.
