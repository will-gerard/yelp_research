I wish I had read this review before going there.  Let me first say, the person who greeted me at the door was very nice, and very helpful, he gets a 5 star.   But, the Pizza was a negative 2 star.  Pizza Hut usually very good in the past, have not had for a couple of years.  I ordered online, timed it so I was there to pick up my pizza 3 or 4 minutes after it came hot out of the oven.  5 minutes back to home.  Pizza was very saucy, dripping of sauce, too much sauce.  Pizza was not nearly as warm as I would have though and the cheese sill had un melted pockets in the pie.  What happened to you Za Hut?  Obviously this location has issues to deal with.

I really wish I could give a good review, I just cannot. My waitress talked me into the rib special, and I ordered an appetizer with it.  The special came with 2 sides.  My waitress came back 2 times cause she forgot my sides, and then forgot what type of beer I ordered.  Of course she did not write it down.    My wings and ribs came out together, first thing that I should have realized that no one really cared how I was taken care of.   I ate my wings first and then cut into my ribs to separate the bones.  My ribs had only been at my table for 10 minutes but when I bit into my ribs the felt like they had just come out of the fridge and never really heated up before they were served.   I am sure they were heated, but not enough to bring the meat up to temperature.    Of course, they were not good, incredibly below average for a smoke house.  My waitress was pretty involved with other people, and I am pretty sure she stayed away because she knew I was not happy with the food.  I cannot speak to any other items on the menu as I did not have any, but the service and the rib special here was just not something that should have been served.

Consistency of food is why I am giving this a 2 star.  I usually order the especial tacos and some days they have cole slaw  that over flows, and some days, you get a couple of strands.  Today, of the three tacos I got, 2 had slaw, 1 did not have hardly any, and 2 of the tacos were almost dry from the sauce that was supposed to be there, and one taco was so soaked in sauce that the tortilla fell apart as it was soaked to the max. Last three times I have been there it has been this way.  Restaurant is usually pretty busy and the condiment bar is usually a mess from all the people using it.  Not appealing.

I wanted to bring a friend here, but he took a look at the menu.  All it said was 8 fish, 8 chicken, 12 shrimp, nothing about lunch specials, so he wanted to go somewhere else.   Too bad I could not convince him how good the food is.  I bet this happens to a lot of people.

Adventure Bicycle Company always gives above and beyond service.  The owner Bill and his staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and incredibly helpful.  You wont find a better bike shop in the East Valley.

I used to like coming to WF and ordering fresh sandwiches, but no more. I have had problems when ordering from this individual before, but I guess what should I expect from someone named Cujo?  My Bad.  His monotone, lack of interest, and complete disregard for me as a customer or a person was inexcusable.  Hey WF's, if you want to be in the Sandwich business, then cater to your customers.  I can go other places for sandwiches that might be a little different than yours, but those places actually act like they want my business.  I don't get treated like I am getting in the way of their very busy day.  Cujo (or what ever your name really is)  Get some training on how to help customers, then use what you learn.  I gave you three chances, all three have been poor.  So, now guess what, because of that terrible experience I am not shopping in your WF's store again, for anything!!!  I can go to Sprouts, Tj's or other WF stores who actually want my business.  See ya Tempe WF's, it hasnt been fun!!!

Usually Church's is ok food.  Tonight the service and the food were the worst I have had anywhere in months.  I guess its because all the employees were paying more attention  to the basketball game and not to the customers.  They told me my extra long wait was for my fries, but when I got them, they were luke warm,.  confusing since I was told they just came out of the fryer.  The girl at the counter called me when my order was ready, but gave me only half of what I wanted.   Then, when she finally assembled the order, they put it in a bag so small, it would not hold everything.  When I got home, I found that the extra biscuit I had ordered had my jalapeno in the same bag.  All the jalapeno juice had leaked onto the biscuit, so i had a sack of wet dough.  It just annoys me to no end when employees will not pay attention th why customers come to their restaurants.  I eat out 85% of my meals, and I can go anywhere.  I happen to like chicken, but am tires of Church's and their give a shit attitude towards the customer.  I know I spend too much on Fast food, but that is what these people want.  Stay away from this one, It is ridiculous.

I have been eating at Tom's for as long as I have lived in the Valley.  Over 15 years.    I am sad to report I am not going back there to eat.  They just do not seem to care about the customer anymore.  I had three horrible meals there, for Toms BBQ.  I emailed them about the problems and never heard back from them.  They have been a long time favorite of mine, but now, I have to find a new BBQ place to go to.

I decided to give the place a second try after my last horrible experience.  I have been a customer for 15 years, but now no more. I was forced to wait to place my order while the counter person told a personal story to some people who had already ordered.  I waited at least three minutes before she acknowledged me and asked if I wanted to order.  She really didn't look like someone who should be behind the counter. improperly dressed, did not know the counter, did not upsell me etc.  The food was fast, but really no flavor.  Pulled pork was dry and not that tasty.  The hot sauce was spicy, and the onion straws were over seasoned.  I have given up on Toms.  Am looking for new BBQ in Phoenix.  Honey Bears is not it either, but that is a different story.

Been coming to this restaurant since 1995 when opened in Tempe.  Had the half and half w the ham skillet.  Protein pancakes were good.  Skillet was awful.  Hash Browns were luke warm at best, meat in skillet was sorta warm.  Over easy egg was medium.  Last rwo visits to you guys have been away from Tempe and very subpar.  I guess I will omly go to Tempe location and since its 35 miles from my house, not too often now.  Sad to have to write this but you guys need to step up the game.

I went there to watch a couple of bowl games.  Two big screen TV's long with a host of other TV's.  Problem was, the Big Screens are so old and so dark its like watching TV through a dirty screen.  Asked the bartender about switching one TV to another game that was on, and no one was watching the game that was on, and i got a dissertation on why She could not do that.  The place has a lot of potential, but the staff seemed very very unhappy, the waitresses looked like they had all just gotten out of bed and threw on clothes cause they had to go to work, no thought process at all.    Food is ok, but pricey for what you get and where your are.  Really nothing special about this place, and the TV situation makes it a not go to ever again to watch a sporting event.

This is one of the best agents I have ever worked with.  They are fast, fair and above all cost effective.  I have enjoyed working with them now and will give them all my insurance needs in the future.  Thank you for all of your professionalism.

Our Waitress was great.  Very attentive, very nice.  Beer was ehhh, ordered 3 pizzas.  All 3 minis came out cold, undercooked, with no sauce at all.  Mine was so undercooked the dough was still in the doughy stage.  Needless to say the pizza was really bad, might have been the worst I have ever had at a restaurant ever.  Not a fan, will not ever go back....Giving it a one star cause our waitress was amazing.  She is the only reason I can say anything nice.  One of the best I have had in a long time.  Too bad the food was so poor.

Lucille's is a nice clean BBQ restaurant.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.  I went there yesterday for the first and last time.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly, but was in that too friendly mode.  I don't know if you know what I am talking about, but it seemed like he was so overly friendly that it was insincere.  And he was one of those type of waiters who was there every 5 minutes at the start of the meal, and no where near at the end of the meal.  We started our meal with their signature biscuits.  We are in AZ so I am sure the cooks do not really now how to cook a good biscuit.  Our nice flakey biscuit was hard and crunchy on the outside, and warm and not flakey on the inside.  The honey butter was marginal.  The onion straw appetizer was good, the best part of the meal.  I had a baby back rib combo with hot links and my friend had the chicken and rib lunch combo.  Same kind of ribs.  The ribs were dry and not very tender.  She said her chicken was good, and my sausage was cooked fine.  No real flavor to the sausage, just spicy.  Overall, as BBQ joints go, I wont be back.  Its hard to create the hole in the wall BBQ joint with a chain, and Lucille's has not done it.

I am going to stop spending my money here.  The Custard is great, the food is average to below, and the counter help could care less if you were there or not.  Spoke to the owner once and I get why the place is this way.  He was frustrated that I would call and tell him about my horrible  experience there after he had just fired all 4 of his mangers and half his staff.  Seems to me that maybe its not the Managers faults, but the training they get from above.  Anyway...not for me any more.  I bet I spent  250 a month there for the last 18 months.  How many other people who dont take the time to write a review has this poorly run restaurant driven off?  Good Luck, I  will not be back.

Greeter at the door was just indifferent, not much personality.  Our waitress was very nice, and she is the reason for a two star, not a one.  Food was not good.  French toast on stale bread.  Just didnt sit right.  I wont be back.

Last three times I have been in the restaurant it has been after 830pm and they are still quite busy.  Tonight, when i was in line, there were 6 people in front of me, 2 who had already ordered.  It seriously took 15 minutes before my order was taken and another 6-7 minutes to complete.  The cashier was off in her own world, all the food was empty and getting refilled, and generally a poorly run night.  Food was ok, nothing to talk about.  But the guac I ordered with my chips was runny and really bad.  You are a quick stop for ok mexican food.  Your late night crew at this restaurant needs to be retaught how to work fast and make people happy.  they clearly need help.    I will probably give them one last chance, but am not looking for much improvement.  This store needs help as Most chipotle stores are 10 times better.

Been here 3 times in 5 months.  Each visit is a nightmare.  The help is not focused, they do not pay attention to your order.  The food is sub standard for sonic, and I will not be back.  Last visit was easy, a burger and tots.  The tots were forgotten, and the burger was so overdone it was crusty.  I would give negative stars if I could.

Been going here for 3 years but I cannot take the service any more.  Food is fine when you get the right order.  The drive through is a nightmare.  The speaker is broken and you cannot understand them and they cannot understand you.  For the most part, the service is very good.  But, like most restaurants of this type, they really do not care if you get good service or not.  This morning was the last straw.  3 times now I have not gotten what I ordered, or the way I ordered it.  Today, the DT was very busy, and I ordered a Bacon Egg Cheese burrito, with 2 fried jalapenos.  My favorite. the person taking my order, a male, does not speak good English.  I had to repeat the order 3 times to him, and then made sure that the girl at the window, knew what I wanted, green sauce with 2 fried jalapenos.  What I got was a potato burrito, red sauce, and pickled jalapenos with carrots.  Really sick and tired of people not listening to what we order, and not paying attention.   I estimate I go there 10 times a month, for around 80 bucks a month spent times 12, that is 960 bucks a year I spend there.  Time for other people too, to find another place to buy mexican food, some where they appreciate your business instead of taking it for granted.  Sorry Federicos, last straw.  I wont be back.

Horticultural Frontiers transformed my backyard from dreary to resort.  It was an incredible transformation to which I am very pleased.  Kent, the owner, has incredible vision.  They finished the project ahead of schedule for me at an incredible price.  I cant wait to use them again.

You guys make a great Cheeseburger, and your Custard concretes are the best in the city.  BUT......  It was a Sunday night at 7 pm, I could not get in the parking lot because the Drive in was packed around the corner...good for you.    I went inside and there were 6 people waiting in line, with one girl running the register.  She was very very good, did not get flustered, but, it was one register open,  I moved up three spots and there were still 7 people behind me.    You were busy and had about 8-10 employees in the back making custards, and catering to the drive thru, making things for the people waiting in side.  But the wait was too long.  There are a ton of places to eat this type of food.  And your place has more the feel of a High School hangout than a professional restaurant.  It was chaotic, noisy, and this right hand did not know what the left hand was doing.    I have spoken to the manager about this before and she is great...but I can tell that you are understaffed and need to have everyone slow down and work as a team instead of  how it is now.  Two thumbs up for the overworked cooks and the girl at the counter.  The food was very tasty, and she was very professional.    All thumbs down for the atmosphere, the chaos and no adult supervision on all the teens working the place.  I keep coming back because I love a good Custard, but I am going to have to stop now, cause I get more and more frustrated at how this place has gone for very good, to just mediocre at best in less than 6 months.

I have a love hate with this place.  Where I really enjoy the food and the custard, big fan., I really just hate the sophomoric atmosphere that is put on by the almost entirely HS age workers. When an adult shows up, the crew seems to follow their manager, but when the manager is not around...its like playday.  This would have been a 1 star but was saved by the Manager in Training and the manager so I am at a 4 star for them and them only.  The older gentleman making concretes is indescribable.  He has no regard for his co workers, or customers.  Tonigh he was banging metal tops to the cookie trays around, making a huge racket.  All the while, I am standing there waiting patiently for my Custard.  10 minutes at least.  My custard was forgotten, again by this guy.  And to make matters worse, he works with out plastic gloves, he grabs glasses and sundae cups by putting his hands over the top of the cup, while empty, and I see him grabbing and putting his hands over the top when they are full too.  It is very unsanitary.   The Manager in training and the manager found out my concrete was missed by Mr Unsanitary, and they came out and apologized, upgraded me to a large and gave me a bunch of coupons.  That is the only reason this is not a 1 star.  I used to go to this place regularly, but have slowed down to 1 or 2 times a month, because of the HS like atmosphere.  The staff is usually ok, but tonight everyone was really grumpy except for the mgrs.  Im cutting back on how often I go again.  It never gets better there, never.  it is hard to staff a restaurant, but Inn n Out does it with HS kids and everyone is great there.  Not at this Culvers.  4 stars for the Managers.....1 star for the rest of the restaurant.  Mr.  Owner... you need to get control of this place.....seriously. .

Food was good.  Beer Cold, Atmosphere fine.  Has a dog friendly patio that was nice.   Green Chili bean dip was too heavy on the beans and too light on the Chili.  If you are going to have some chili dip, give the customer the option to put some heat in it.  As it was served, it was not as spicy as my mint toothpaste.  Nice place, I would go to again.

I love Culvers because it reminds me of home.  The food is usually very good and who can say anything bad about Custard.    My problem is with Culvers all over the Valley and not just this one. Employees, when you are at work, please be at work.  The last three times I have been at Culvers, I know the employees would rather be anywhere else than where they were. They have not listened to me, they constantly ask again and again what I want, they get interrupted by other employees which takes them back to square 1 cause they forget what they were doing.  Tonight I was handed off between two employees for my order.  One of the employees had never run the register before, and he was interrupted several times.  Of course my order was not correct, even after starting over 3 times to get it right.  The kid was trying, he just didnt have the training to be where he was.   Just a poor way to run a register.  I can get a burger anywhere, and probably will from now on.  Custard is making its appearance in Phoenix finally and I will have other places to go for that also.  Culvers Management, your employees need training.  They need to know that when they are working, they need to be with the Customer, treat us with respect, LISTEN TO US, and get our orders right.  Get this message out, your employees, this is not a part time job after school and you do not have to work hard.  Culvers has a good reputation all over the US.  People in Phoenix/Scottsdale can shop anywhere for food like this.  Make the experience pleasant and memorable for the right reasons and people will come back.  When they come back, you will continue to have a job.  I have no reason to come back now until it gets hot and custard is on my mind.   Give me a reason to come back for other things....

Looking at the reviews, I know what the problem is here.  Yeah, not coming back.  Been to many JJ's and this is the worst I go to .  Will spend my dollars somewhere else.  I showed up when the MGR, (a really personality dead individual) was counting out the drawer.  He told me I had to wait.  But the Sandwich maker said, what are you having, I will get it going.  (5 stars with this guy)  He made my sandwich and wrapped it up.  As He put the tape on it I asked him to cut it in half.  He started to unwrap and I said, no worries, just cut through the paper and rewwrap it.  No big deal from me.  As soon as he cut through the paper, the manager, who had 3 people waiting in line, stops helping his customers, turns, points, and yells, dont ever do that again.  I was stunned he would yell like that, and the Sandwich maker says, what?  The MGR yells again, and louder, dont ever cut through the paper again, if paper gets in the sandwich, then we have to remake it. Now I started to tell him that I I asked for that to be done, but this brain dead individual would have nothing of it.  He is one of those domineering managers who is my way or the highway.  I told the SM guy that I was sorry, and he says, I have to go through this all the time.  I have owned businesses and run businesses and there is a time and a place to talk to your employees.  Never is it to stop what you are doing and yell at someone in front of the whole store.  I will eat next door, or down the street, but not here again.  Lots of 1 stars on this restaurant, I would lay doughnuts to dollars that they started about the time this guy was hired.  Find another job buddy, you are not a manager and do not need to be the face of a customer service based company.

My review is about the service.  The food is fine.  its sub sandwich food and gets a 3 start.  Nothing to separate their food from the 100's of choices that are out there. What is killing this business and all businesses like this, is the people who work there.  It is a problem industry wide, and at this restaurant 2 times as bad. 2 times the service was horrible, I walked out the first time as an employee mocked me.  Today, the 3 people act like they would rather be anywhere else in the world but there.  I actually do not blame them, I blame the management of Jersey Mikes and all restaurants like them.   I have 100's of choices on where I am going to get food when I want to buy it, 96 out of 100 treat you like they could care less if you come in and buy from them or not.  4 will make you feel appreciated to spend your money with them.  This particular store is not one of the restaurants that make you feel welcome, they just want to  take your order, half listen to you about what you ordered, and then make you feel like crap that you ordered from them when you leave. Good Luck....just not worth this experience here any more.

Very friendly atmosphere. Everyone said Hi as we walked in the door. It was very busy, but we got right in.  Our server Cheyenne was professional and very pleasant.  The only negative I would have to say is it took a little too long for someone to greet us after we sat down and take our drink order.  Minor!!!!  Food was good and served in a timely manner.  Atmosphere was fine.  My P's enjoyed the restaurant and said they would go back, not an easy task for them. Great Job Texas Roadhouse...
