I Love this little Cafe. I have been going to 40th Street since they opened. I'm pretty sure my Dad's a regular. Everything I get is just how I expect it. My usual is ham and eggs which is a pretty good size breakfast to include hashbrowns and a bread. Coffee is wonderful!!  I have even tried their lunches. They made a pretty good burger and buffalo chicken sandwich is great. They have great daily specials as well. Friendly ladies too. Thanks Ladies =)

Just had a great birthday dinner!! Every time I've eaten at The Keg it's been delicious, so worth it!! Our waiter was Greg and he was super friendly and did an Exceptional job!! Need more waiters like him   I had the ribeye which was absolutely amazing along with the asparagus.  Mike's New York was gone when I looked over. Lol  Thx again Greg for the recommendations. Definitely coming again.

This was my first time at Magdalena's. I have difficult gray to cover and tried to do it myself at home with no success. She did a Great job covering grays and added mild highlights. Over time we'll go lighter and lighter. Haircut was very appealing as well. All the stylists did a wonderful job on the men, women & children who came in while I was there. The other lady who shampooed my hair gave a nice scalp massage helps for good circulation.   They also offer other services including extensions. Thanks ladies for a great relaxing experience.

Trader Joe's is a great place to get healthy/gourmet foods at comparable prices. Small country store feel. Very friendly employees. My son who has social anxiety can tolerate coming with me because it's a much smaller grocery store.

Tiny's is right ...... it's a tiny place but soooo worth the wait.   They have an awesome NY steak and eggs for $6 bucks and it's plenty of food. Everything I've had on my several visits have been wonderful.   The staff is friendly and it's just a good ol' country kitchen. They have a multitude of specials all over the wall above the grill. Amazing cinnamon rolls or should I say bigger than softball size. Huge.

Thank you ladies who helped me in the pharmacy tonight. I'm glad you're open late at the same time I'm sorry you have to work late  Everyone is always so nice here when I've come in. I didn't catch both the ladies names in the pharmacy but Katie was on my receipt. Thank you again!!! Very nice and friendly.

I was a patient in the ER with an electrical burn. I was seen pretty quickly and the staff was friendly and efficient. Nurse Michelle was helpful in answering all my questions. They even sent me home with reading material for my situation.  I had to pay a visit to the lab and they were great.   Kudos to the ED and Lab for making my unfortunate situation a comfortable & caring visit.

Ladies great place for tools for your crafting projects, not to mention the ladies room is cleaner than I expected (that's important to us ladies). Good prices too.

Went there for dinner, a little wait but worth it. Waited at the bar and had a frozen Grasshopper yummmm. Mike had an ice cold Coors on draft. Who doesn't love ice cold beer.  All the employees were friendly and quick. Most of the menu is from the "old" Frog in Cave Creek with the exception of a few new additions.   We ordered the BBQ Platter and it was huge at $17.99 to include one side and a soup or salad. It has a selection of beef and pork ribs, brisket and pulled pork. I will have 3 meals from this. By-the-way, it taste great the next day :)   NOT dried out just add a sprinkle of water and cover it.  We took advantage of the 15% off for mentioning yelp also you can find coupons for buy 1 get 1 free sandwich on the back of your Fry's grocery receipt. ENJOY!!!!!

Great diner!! Had eggs, ham, biscuits & gravy for $7.29. I could only eat half :)  It was great! I'm not a home-style potato fan (luv hash browns) but they were ok. Eggs were big, ham was hearty not fatty. Biscuits & gravy were great!! Coffee was awesome too.   The waitress was wonderful and smiles :-D  We will be back.

I'm pretty sure there was a communication breakdown. I don't know anyone who WANTS polish on their cuticles. It's happened twice here. I don't understand. She tried to fix it by clipping my cuticles and I even pointed to the cuticle tool asked her to push them back but she kept cutting until I bled. To top it off she charged me full price. Very disappointed. It seemed she didn't even understand what the problem was so I give up. I'm not going to be back. Will post pic. Bummer. * Just got home and it's still bleeding it better not get infected or we're going to have a problem.  Also got polish on my finger .... C'mon seriously.

Their amenities are super!!! 5 tanning stand-up rms, 2 massage recliners, 2 pressure water massage beds & 2 red light vibration rooms for skin and circulation. Personal trainer is included in my membership as well. Love, love, love it

The 1 star is for getting my drink correct. I got up to the drive thru and the young lady handed my coffee with at least 2 large hickies on her neck. I understand they're not the most professional plp out there but have some class. I've only been here a handful of times and this is the last time I'm coming to this location. 99% of the time the plp are rude, arguing in back and look very unhappy with their jobs. I feel like I'm a burden on them.  ATTN: Store Mgr/Supervisors you're lack of customer service training is clearly evident. You're cheating these young people out of future opportunities to better themselves by not giving them the skills to succeed. I'm not saying the customer is always right but if you want us to continue to be patrons at this location then I would hope you will choose to take action.  From a very dedicated DD fan
