Chicken Risotto! UM YES! Went here with friends and the drink specials were awesome...The drunken italian sodas were delicious. The hummus, paired with fresh pita was perfect and the Chicken Apricot sandwich was the best I have had. Kind of reminded me of the Menais Je Tois at Ike's in SF. Overall great atmosphere, friendly waitress, delicious food and kick ass drink specials. I am a fan.

WARNING WARNING WARNING!!!! Worst haircut of my life! I should have never cheated on my stylist. Definitely learned my lesson. I gave the lady very specific instructions, she even repeated what I said and then proceed to take out the clippers and instead of a fade used a 1 and went straight up the side of my head to the point of no return. I was literally speechless. I have a professional job and I have no idea what they are going to say when I go in on Monday but it was unfixable. Instead of "cleaning up the sides" she shaved almost to the middle-top of my head.... talk about J. I Jane status.   Unless you don't care what your hair looks like and just want a military cut don't waste your time, money, or style.  I was pissed, almost in tears, pointed out their mistake and they still made me pay for it. A horrible business.

Seriously? People in AZ must be hard up for good ice cream. Just because they put unique combinations together doesn't mean that it's good ice cream. Maybe I'm biased because I'm from San Francisco and have been spoiled with Bi-Rite ice cream.   I do know good ice cream when I eat it and sweet republic is all hype.   The salted caramel started out good but then just tasted like flavored whipped cream. It left a rotten milk after taste in my mouth that made me keep saying ew. I tried the honey blue cheese. Very strong flavor but nothing special.   I get what they were trying to do and it's a good thing they're in Arizona because in California they wouldn't be as successful.   Not to mention the staff was rude. We were the only ones in there on a hot Saturday afternoon (which should tell you something), and there were three people behind the counter but it still took a few minutes before we were acknowledged. Then the lady was simply cold and annoyed.   Ok point taken we won't be back. Not a loss. Well at least not for us.

As far as buffets go this place is pretty dam good. Saturday they have the all you can eat crab legs and for $12 you can't beat it. The service is great , very attentive. I didn't give it five stars because there is still room for improvement in terms of the desserts and a couple of the dishes - i.e. the chow mein (not fabulous) but overall one of the best oriental buffets I have been to.

The best Italian food I've ever had (and I lived in North Beach in San Francisco). The second I walked in, the owner Tommy greeted me with a warm Italian welcome. Our Waiter John was amazing. The food was out of this world! From appetizers to desert I was impressed. 1. Sacchetti Con 4 Formaggio E Pere: Homemade pasta pouches. Filled with 4 cheeses and fresh pears in a brown butter sauce with romano cheese shavings. 2.Penne Alla Vodka: Penne with Tomato Vodka Cream Sauce  3.Fettuccine Alfredo

Kevin has been working with us on our water heater and he is always on time, always nice and definitely knows his business. I can't believe he hasn't been reviewed. Definitely the nicest "handyman" I have ever met and reasonable in pricing

We came for the mango salsa dogs and we weren't disappointed! The owner is super cool. He went out of his way to make us happy. Great laid back atmosphere reminds me of the beach cafes in San Diego. The tater totes are perfect and the red cream soda mixed with spite tastes like a Shirley temple :)
