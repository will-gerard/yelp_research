Quality atmosphere serving quality Southwestern cuisine.  From happy hour to brunch to wowing out-of-town clients and friends this is my go-to restaurant.  Please, whatever you do, start with the roasted garlic plate or bacon wrapped shrimp and a prickly pear margarita.  Follow up this five star opener with any other southwestern entree paired with an earthy red wine and the magic of the Rokerij will engulf you.  Secret Tip:  Sister restaurant Dick's Hideaway at 16th and Bethany Home for the same menu in a top-secret location.  Find me here for brunch every other Sunday (Carne Adovado and Eggs)

As Norma Desmond Said:  "I am big.  It's the pictures that got small!"  What a classic little space the Harkins Camelview 5 is. Walking into the entrance reminds me of the reason I fell in love with movies as a kid and ended up working in the motion picture industry for over 15 years.  I've since come to my senses and returned to being a movie patron and fallen in love with the independent, art-house, and foreign films that play at the Camelview.  Although it's not got the steep stadium seating as in the larger multi-plexes and you may feel as though you are further away from the screen, it's got tons of legroom and the new seats you're used to at other modern theaters.    Enjoy the show!  My Tip:  Invest in the Harkins T-Shirt & Cup and get free popcorn and $1.50 sodas at the concession all year long!

It's hard to find fault in a place with a happy hour that is so good the most expensive item on our check was the iced tea.  Even logging onto their website puts me back into that ethereal frame of mind that is District American Kitchen and Wine Bar.  The style and laid back atmosphere that is this destination on the corner of 3rd Street and Van Buren is replicated by the design and music on their website.  This is by far my favorite downtown Happy Hour, with smooth DJs keeping the mood going but allowing for patrons to network, laugh, and have a great experience and escape from the heat of the city.  Lots of loose ties, heels delicately hanging from toes, and "whew I made it through another workday" conversations all around.  Start with the White Peach Sangria and join the conversation.  I highly recommend the hummus and wings for light snacks before hitting up the real menu for five-star salads and dynamite crab cakes.  Being only a couple of blocks from the Convention Center allows for a great meeting place after a long day on the show floor.  For more hearty affairs go for the NY Steak and White Cheddar Potato Gratin and definitely add the Garlic Spinach as a side.  Secret Tip:  Each entree has a wine listed to pair with your meal to experience the full effect.  Cheers!

Meh, I've experienced better is the caption that goes along with selecting two stars and yes I've definitely experienced better at this restaurant.   I highly recommend breaking out the time machine and visiting District American Kitchen and Wine Bar last year.  I don't know why they had to change a good thing but the food is a definite miss.  Here's to hoping things will come around.

50% off wine Sunday good!  $5.00 burger Monday good!  Not to mention the best Hot Vings this side of the Half Court Marker!  Happy hour, brunch, cheap wine and fresh fruit Sundays, and yep... $5.00 burgers and fries after 6:00 on Monday... it's a no-brainer.  I'll admit that the reason we moved into the amazing neighborhood that 16th Street and Bethany Home has become is due, in significant part, to the Vig.  Like they say "Let's just go to the Vig!"  Although I am stumbling distance from this brilliant looking establishment that reminds me of a modernized Brady Bunch rumpus room, it's really the whole experience that has won me over.  Even the menu is basement casual with an uptown slant... from the Deconstructed Fish Taco Salad, to the Holy Mac N' Cheese, or the Legalize Pot Roast it really ties the room together, man.  The Trifecta is their slider platter, which hits the pallino every time and as my father-in-law put it "has the perfect meat to bun ratio."  My Tip:  Slip into the "faux patio" for some brilliant Bocce Ball court play.

Laugh until your sides hurt!  Thank you CityScape for creating a reason for us to go downtown.  Stand Up Live is the first business of the many I plan to review down here. I won two tickets by signing up to be on their email list last spring and have been going back every few weeks.  Definitely do your research to see who's coming and make sure their brand of comedy is your thing.  I've brought family, friends, and colleagues and we've all left with our sides sore from laughing and impressed with not just the headliners but the local Phoenix talent as well.  Get there early to secure a good seat, and for those that don't want to be crammed into the long tables down front - don't be afraid to ask for a seat along the side or near the back, I prefer these if you want a little more atmosphere and great people watching.  Secret Tip:  After the show walk right into Copper Blues (their sister establishment) for some great live music, beverages, and an all around good time!
