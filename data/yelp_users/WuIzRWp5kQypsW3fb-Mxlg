DO NOT USE THEM!!  They will way overcharge you. The guy tried to charge me $404.70 to rekey my house which has 3 points of entry. They still ended up charging us $337.33 which is completely absurd for the service rendered. Go with anyone else except these guys.

This place has been my go to for sushi spot in the more central part of Phoenix as of lately. Consistently has good rolls and cocktails. The happy hour is probably the best sushi happy hour around.

They showed up and got my lawnmower up and running for a really reasonable price. What more more could you ask for?

Seriously really good sushi here, with some unique rolls that are great. The atmosphere is pretty underwhelming so don't expect it to be a good spot for a super romantic date night, but if you just want good sushi this is one of the best spots downtown.

These guys are seriously so helpful and knowledgable. You can take your car into them feeling confident. Personally, I will take my vehicles no other place because they are trustworthy, skillful mechanics that genuinely love people and want to help you!
