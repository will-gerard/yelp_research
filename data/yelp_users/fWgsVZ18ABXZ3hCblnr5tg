Qdoba why hadn't I tried you sooner, wait it's because I live in Buckeye. Lol I had the three cheese nachos with the green salsa and chicken. I wouldn't like to compare it to Chipotle since all they really have in common is the fact that it's a "Mexican Grill," the flavors are completely different the chicken however does have more flavor.   If I ever find myself downtown again I will definitely stop in again.

If you lived in Phoenix, your visiting, or your just strolling by I would check out South Mountain. They have hiking trails for just about anyone (Beginner's or not.)   The view if you take your car up to the top is still very good. You can start to see that pollution has taken a toll on the clarity, but it is not Los Angeles yet even though I believe we are well on our way. Unfortunately.  Take your kids before your not able to see the whole city.

I absolutely love love love the LoveSac, and their employees! I've always passed by the store I mean ever since I can remember.  You always walk in there and immediately get greeted by someone and asked if you have any questions.   Until recently I never really had the intention of buying one but my husband and I figured if we're going to spend money on new couches lets make it from there.   After reading the amazing reviews the product has I decided to look into it myself. They have an amazing warranty,  they pretty much guaranty that the couch seats won't go flat. This might be one of the most annoying things that can happen to a couch. So we decided to it went in and had the pleasure of speaking with Roy, who by the way is one of the most amazing sales person ever. My husband is one of those people that have a billion and one questions. At no time did it seem to bother him. We walked out with a quote and all of our questions answered.   In April we should have everything set up! (Our choice not having anything to do with the LoveSac.)   Will update review.

If I could give this place NO STARS I would. My brothers and I took my Mom their once for their birthday and waited about 30 minutes for someone else with the same amount of people in their party to get seated before us when they had arrived after. The girl that was in charge of putting us down on the list totally forgot to do so. We only figured this out when my brother when to ask her how much longer we would be waiting she looked at him super confused like what are you talking about your not on the list but with out having to say anything. I got so mad that we just left and went ac cross the street to Friday's unfortunately is not longer open. I will not be going their ever again tried to report them to corporate and I couldn't find a way to do it.

Never been disappointed at this Cheesecake Factory,  the service is always great. I especially like the bread they bring while you wait for your food so fresh and yummy.   I can't really tell you about any other dish other than the Chicken Madeira and the chicken alfredo, what can I say I love chicken.  The tropical tea is also really good tricks you into thinking its sweet so no sugar is reallw needed.

I have been to this office a couple of times and was holding off on writing a review just so that I could give an accurate review of my experience.   On my first prenatal visit I felt like I was literally dying! I had lost 10lbs and could not keep any fluids or food down. I was seen by Ingrid, and My husband and I  just wanted to take her home with us. She's so positive, explained everything thoroughly and with an amazing attitude. We were able to listen to our babies heartbeat and take some ultrasound images home. As well as a prescription for dissolvable nausea pills that are STILL saving me till now.   I'm now in my second trimester and stand by everything I have said after meeting our doctor, Dr.Oland! He truly is amazing he answers your questions as if he's never been asked before, which we all know he has a billion times. No question is too "dumb" so it made me feel very comfortable.   And of course like mentioned before the front staff isn't always the friendliest (only one individual) but the doctors and nurses even the Sonoran Quest lady are worth visiting this office. Keep up the good work!

Good China is the place to go if your on a budget, want good food, and want to invite some friends or family. This is the place we go whenever we want to share some laughs. Our family consists of eight people and we usually order an order of: Broccoli beef, Fried Rice, Mongolian Beef, and sweet and sour. Reviews are true the owner or manager is kind of rude at times but you can't beat the prices and the food.   Also, if you work near by they have lunch specials nothing is over $6.50, and you get fried rice almost everything on the regular menu, and an egg roll. Can't beat those prices.

My sister invited me to come a long on a field trip her school was going on to this Museum. Even though I had to run around with five, fifth graders it wasn't bad at all. The kids really enjoyed all of the dinosaurs they had on display, but they especially liked looking for Gold.   The museum was fairly full that day as other schools decided to join us as well so getting all the kids a fair chance to look for Gold was hard since the space was very limited.    Overall I would probably visit the museum again either with my three year old niece or when I have children of my own.

It might not be located in one of the best places in town, but it is worth it. Something that I really struggle with in Arizona is finding a seafood restaurant where the food is as good as the service. I must say that I have found it! Finally!!

Please do not categorize yourself under Mexican food, your just giving it a bad name. The food is absolutely not authentic or maybe the times that I've gone the person cooking wasn't the same as in these other reviews.   In some of my other reviews I've talked about what to look for before ordering. Well if they offer you free chips and salsa and the chips are hard and stale. Pay for your drink and run out of the door like now!   Just try some of the other smaller businesses around you might find something way better.

Had a Panda bowl with chow mein and broccoli beef, pretty standard for Panda Express. Only problem I had was with the broccoli not being cooked enough it looked and tasted like they threw it in last minute.     Overall restaurant was clean, fast, with very friendly staff and good portions he could barely put the lid on. : )

I can honestly say this is one of the best pizzas I have ever had.   My husband and I went in, after a coworker of his told us about how amazing the pizza was at Biancos. So we decided to give it a try. Unlike many of the other people reviewing, we did not have to wait for a table since we went on a Tuesday afternoon.  Not knowing what to expect at first we ordered one pizza to share. Half wiseguy and half margarita with mushrooms. Both were very good even though I preferred the margarita pizza. Just not a fan of the whole onions and what not. Everything just felt really fresh. I really liked their black tea as well even without sugar it tasted just fine.  We're planning another trip to Biancos soon, but this time we might take a couple of friends to enjoy it with us.

I went in to get a haircut and of course I already knew what I wanted. I shower the girl that was cutting my hair a picture of what I wanted and she nailed it! I love my new haircut.   The only thing I had a problem with was how long the wait was. When I walked in I wasn't even greeted, and no one asked to sign me in. So while I was sitting there I checked in online to make sure my spot was saved. Their was nine people on their list by the time I was called and only 3 girls cutting hair, but their was more people in their backroom laughing and chatting.  I could tell that some of the people waiting were a little uneasy.    Next time I'll check in before I get there and maybe call and ask hoe many people are waiting ahead.

Popusas de chicharon con queso (pork and cheese) are the best! Ohh and the salad they give you on the side is also some of the best I've had. All of the popusas are made to order so it might take bit eat a little snack if your really hungry. They're hand made. The best thing is that you can see them making them if you stand by the cash register.   They are always very nice it almost feels like your family here. Being Mexican we don't really make popusas so at first I didn't know what I was ordering they will definitely help you out.   Enjoy

We take our now 9 month Bull Terrier. We've taken Rex here since we bought him at three months. All of the staff there loves him, they're really kind with him since we know he's a real handful. We've only taken him to one other Vet but only because it was in the middle of the night.

This is the worst Subway I have ever been to. Walked it very hungry I did the two or more footlongs for ten dollars. I ordered the Chicken, bacon, ranch sub and everything looked like it had been sitting their for a while. Nothing looked fresh like subway says to be. The metal counter they have where they're making your sub was dirty, looked it they wipe it down once ever ten subs they made. Ultimately I got home ate half of my sub and just couldn't finish eating it.   Like some other reviews mention the staff is kind of rude so you shouldn't go in there when your very hungry or you might end up leaving upset.

They have almost anything you might be looking for when it comes to your Mexican needs. The sweet bread is always fresh and soooo good with either a hot coffee or  hot chocolate whichever you prefer.  Their aguas frescas (fruit waters) are also very yummy my favorites being the Cantaloupe and watermelon one.   One thing I absolutely love about this place and wish they had something like this is Buckeye is the fish fry. If you fish from their seafood department they will fry it for you for free! Then stop by their tortilla section get some fresh tortillas, some limes and enjoy. You can buy everything and eat there also.

Start by staying I'm not a big comic book/superhero kind of person. I don't really follow any of that, but my 13 year old brother does. We were at Glendale Glitters and decided to walk in and take a look. Everyone was very friendly even though it was very busy.   We walked around trying to look through everything and not knowing how everything worked (series). I asked someone of they could help us. I wish I could remember the name of the guy that helped us because he was very informative and he genuinely wanted to help. He asked my brother what who he liked and talked him about every series that has ever been out and how to find them for next time.   I made a deal with my brother if he kept his grades up we would go into the comic bool store so he could pick out whatever he wanted.  So far he's kept up with his side of the deal already earning high school credits in middle school! I am glad we walked into that store that day.   Their isn't anything better than encouraging young children to read, and this might be the best way to do it while supporting local businesses.  Thank you!

This was my second time having middle eastern food, and the first time I was with my sister in law who lived in Lebanon for two years. So I was a little scared. The menu is very easy to read and understand. Most or all the ingredients are listed so you now exactly what your about to eat.   My Mom and my brother went along with me and it was their first time ever eating it. We ordered the Lebanon chicken which comes with rice, and a Greek salad.  As well as the Kafta, Chicken skewers, falafel and I almost forgot the hummus.   Everything was delicious! . My husband wasn't able to make it so I brought home the mixed skewers and the Greek salad.    It was kind of busy in there so the service wasn't the fastest. It seemed like they were a little under staffed in front. It was only on lady trying to take orders fro over 20 people all at once. Until a little later I believed it was the owners that came up and they started to help. They were very friendly and offered refills on our drinks. t. I live all the way in Buckeye so the drive was definitely a long one, but it was absolutely worth it. I gave it four stars just because we did have to wait a very long time, everyone there kind of felt the same way.

Went with a friend she had bought an Amazon deal so she wanted to use the voucher. I wouldn't came back even if I had a voucher. The service is great the place is clean and nice, but the sushi is just not good. I had the crunchy roll; the rice just fell apart wouldn't hold. It lacked a lot of flavor. I won't be back again.

I really love Shane's rib shack if it was closer to my job I would totally eat here everyday! I'm a big bbq fan. Everytime I stop by Shane's I have the Big Dad; pulled pork sandwich, and the macaroni and cheese. Always perfect.

I had the parmesan encrusted chicken, and I've never been disappointed.  I love their mashed potatoes, and their broccoli ir has this lemon-y flavor which isn't typically done.   The service here is always very good I have never left here disappointed. Their house beers are so very good if your over the age of 21, and would like to try something different I would say definitely to for it. Almost forgot to mention their Italian sodas are gooood!   It's almost always very busy, so I would try to call ahead and check in.

My husband and I stopped by to have lunch one day at this location. Their salsa is very good I don't know if they have a specific name so excuse me if they do, but we loved their red salsa. We shared some of their carne asada fries they were really good. Just the fries at this location taste a little different from others we have had.   The service was very fast and the girl that helped us was very friendly. I believe it might of taken me longer to get all the salsas that wanted to try than it did to get our food out.   We will be visiting this location again.

I love love love, Paradise Bakery. I have had problems before with my phone orders but nothing that couldn't be fixed with a FREE box of cookies.  Customer service is always great and the food is also very yummy.   Being that I'm pregnant I am obsessed with the Turkey bravo BLT (antibiotic free Turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomatoe, on sourdough bread) and a side if their white cheddar Mac and cheese. So yummy!   Be aware that during lunch time it does get very busy and you might be waiting a little while in line.  Take an extra person so they can grab a table before you order.  Also,  since you might be waiting in line get on their free Wi-Fi and check out their menu.

Best cake I have ever tasted and I for one am not a cake lover at all. My husband and I ordered one a cake for our wedding held on April 20, 2013, we wanted a cake that was being displayed at the store but didn't want it to be made with fondant,  Jay worked with us and made it out of buttercream. All of the flavors we picked were amazing ranging from banana bread with fresh bananas to red velvet with cream cheese.   I am currently pregnant and my husband cannot wait for the baby shower which won't be until January of 2015. He's already thinking about what flavors he wants the cake to be.

This Olive Garden is always a hit or miss for us. The service is always very good, but the food is what is never consistent. We had the Chicken and gnocchi soup and the Chicken Alfredo pasta. We ate almost all of the pasta and left the chicken which was a waste. It tasted like it was a little undercooked.    After that my husband said we were better off going to Red Lobster or making the drive to the one on 75th and Thomas. I might never visit this Olive Garden again. Not worth what your paying for unless its the servers your there to see.

Why must you keep disappointing me Olive Garden, why?!   Was in there yestersay July 22, for lunch and it was pretty empty in there for a while so no excuses. It took a little while after being seated for someone to come over to take our drink order it felt like forever especially after coming out of 100 degree weather.   Then, after drinks it took another lifetime to get our food order taken which we should of just done after we ordered, since we ALWAYS order the samething.    It took 11 minutes after ordering our food to get our soup and salad I feel like that is a little ridiculous. The people sitting behind us arrived 20 minutes after us and got their soups and salads at the sametime we did.     Luckily the chicken wasn't undercooked this time it was perfect!   I would probably have to say we experienced all of this due to our server as another table was also complaining about her.

My brother in law is from Thailand, & I hadn't found anything that compared to his cooking until I found a restaurant on 75th & McDowell, but they closed down. Until my husband suggested we try Sala Thai he always passed by. So we decided to give it a try. He had the Yellow Curry, & I had the BBQ Chicken and beef fried rice. He is a really picky eater when it comes to food he's already had and liked before. After our meal he said "That was BOMB right amount of spicy and sweet" I really enjoyed my meal next time I won't order the fried rice but only the BBQ just because it was a lot of food for just me. We will defiantly be going there again! OHH try their THAI TEA!

Every time someone invites me to have lunch Sala thai is usually the first thing that runs into my mind. I really like their BBQ Chicken, it's always cooked to perfection never too dry. You must try one of their thai teas they're definitely one of the best I've had. The customer service is also very good. I believe the last time I was there the owner must of been there he wad very attentive and friendly. He offered me to try my fried rice with some chili sauces and explained to me all the levels. For instance, he said use just the juice for the least amout of hot, the seeds will at more, and the actual chili will be the hottest.  No one had ever offered trying it that way. So I gave it a try and it added more flavor which of course I would never mind.

Bring your ear plugs because your going to need them. The place is extremely small and feels over crowded. My friend and I went in to enjoy some seafood, but from the beginning it was a bad experience. We walked in and one of the servers accused us of trying to skip some people that were there before us. We didn't even know who to talk to in order to get on the waiting list.   After about 10 minutes of wait we were sat down. The table we were setted at next to the door so ever time someone walked it it hit the back of my friend's chair. So we asked to be moved and got an ugly look, but we moved to another table.   The food is very good just like seafood should be fresh! Everything tasted fresh we had oysters, & tostadas de ceviche (shrimp tostadas.) The micheladas are very good also if your over the age of 21 of course.    If the music wasn't so loud, I mean having a live band is such a small space is a horrible idea. You can't even hear the person across or next to you speak. This place definitely needs to make some changes before I ever go back.

I really do wish I could remember the names of the people that have helped us when going into Kirkland. They were amazing some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. You can tell that the employees are very happy here or it seems like. The lady that helped us explained how beneficial it was to get on their rewards program. Which in my Mom's case it is absolutely true she's in here at least three times a month if not more!  They always have really nice things for your home. At first I thought this store was not for me and I didn't know what I was missing.  They have something for everyone.  I had bought an accent table for my living room at Marshalls, and I found something better here for about the same price.  I really do wish I would of at least stopped here before purchasing it.   Kirkland has a variety of items such as: Candles, tables, clocks, things for your man cave, table center pieces, a lot of things for your kitchen. I mean everything.    And believe me they are ways willing to answer any of the questions that you may have about how something works or an item.

From time to time I like to stop at thrift shops to see if I can find some special for my home; mostly my garden. I've found a couple of things at a less expensive price than at the store to be expected. It's a pretty good size thrift store.

So far one of my favorite Chipotle locations in Arizona, the other being on 67th ave and Thomas rd. For the most part the staff is wonderful. I always end up having very funny people help me at check out.   It does matter what time you make it at. Usually,  right around 7-8 at night they start getting pretty busy. So their might be some delay. I did wait almost 10-15 in line before being helped, but I left the restaurant super happy. Thanks to their wonderful customer service.   The food is very consistent with what Chipotle should be and taste like. I always have their bowls and ask for extra beans or rice (at no extra charge), and have tried all the meats. I especially like the chicken, barbacoa, and Carnitas. The steak is not for me I like mine well done. The chips are never stale as I have bought stale chips from other locations. The amounts given are very good for the price you are paying. If not you can always ask them to put a little more and I am sure they won't charge you extra. You're able to ask for either "double meat" and pay extra (you get two types of meats) or you could ask for "half and half" so you get the portions you would pay for one type of meat at no extra charge.   I hope they never change.

Walked in with the intention of buying a pair of comfortable walking shoes for our vacation to Mexico. The staff greeted us as soon as we walked into the store, and asked if we needed help with anything. I started browsing at the clothing, since almost everything is on sale right now. Yes, I LOVE sales so I went pretty crazy.    My husband meanwhile was looking at shoes and found a pair that was also water resistant perfect for the beach. We didn't even know they made these the staff helped us by asking what they were for giving him more options. He finally picked two pairs of which only one was available in his size. One of the other girls at the store went into their backstock, just to make sure the other girl didn't miss them. That just showed that they really do care about their customers.    This location has great customer service and like I said before many items are on sale. Will definitely be coming back when purchasing another pair of shoes.

I love PetSmart we've always bought our Bull Terriers food here. We like that they have a variety of food I especially like the all natural selections that they offer. The staff is always very friendly. They always help me out with questions about the different types of food and training for our hyper bull terrier.

I don't know what it is about Chick-fil-A, but everyone is always so nice and I love it! It's a little pricier than most other fast food joints, but it's worth it. I almost always get the chicken nuggets, waffle fries and their fantastic lemonade.

Peter Piper Pizza is on of my favorite pizza places even though we don't eat here to often which is the reason for my four starts. I personally would give it five stars but my husband wouldn't agree. These are his reasons and I agree, but I believe its totally worth it. They don't deliver which makes it a little inconvenient their prices are pretty high compared to other pizza places that do deliver. Even though they don't have a lot of business they take a little long in making your pizza, but over all its always very good so the wait for me at least is OK sometimes. The pizza buffet is pretty much worth coming for especially since they let you take it as take out for the same price.

Yogis is the place to go for lunch if you can. Their lunch special is pretty good you get a teriyaki bowl and a drink for around $6-7? Can't really remember right now.   The place is always clean the staff isn't always the best but they try.   The new soda machine is awesome you can no chose from a variety of coca cola products so your not so limited there. The Thai tea with boba is actually pretty great. I would say much better than the boba shop in the same plaza.   Still not a big fan of the sushi and haven't really tried anything else on their menu other than the potatoe cake? Not so great so I might just stick to what I know and have come to love yogis for their chicken teriyaki bowl.

Like agree with a lot of the other reviews about this place. Everything does taste very homemade the owners are the people that help you out when ordering and I want to say they are also the cooks. So it's like going to your Mexican parents house to eat which of course I love.        They have a variety taco meats my favorite and the best to get just to play it safe then if you like those you can start trying the other meats. This is true anywhere you go.         I don't think I have any complaints about the place. It's always very clean and organized even when it's busy and the people don't stop being any nicer. Their salsa bar is always clean which is something to always look at, always!

Freddy's is like no other fast food place in the West Valley. The first time I went I was hooked, I got the singe patty with bacon and pickles, and it was fantastic. You get plenty of fries so my husband and I just share them. If you have room for dessert and it's available have the strawberry shortcake ice-cream. Every time my husband and I watch a movie at the Palm Valley we stop by before our showing.

Best white chocolate oatmeal cookie!   Shop is very cozy inside and can get pretty packed when an event is going on. They have limited seating inside, but you can always grab your cookie and enjoy it on the go. The people there are very nice and informative when it comes to the area.

My husband is from Los Angeles, and if your from there or have been their you know of Tom's. They have all sorts of crazy burgers and chilly cheese fries. For the longest we couldn't really find anywhere near us where we could find such thing other than Wendy's. Until one of our friends told us about Jim's he talked about how great it was.So we decided to give it a try.   The food was good we had a regular Bacon cheese burger, and an order of Pastrami Chili Cheese fries which were AWESOME! We came to find out by one of the girls that works that the business actually does come from California.   The restaurant when you walk in is clean, and kind of busy we went on a Sunday around 1Pm can't imagine going when people are out of Church, but that not my point. I had seen some reviews talking about the the owner "Jim?" is rude. She was nice when we went to order, but from the looks of it she's not so nice to some of her employees.  We will be returning until we find something better, until then I'll make sure to treat the employees extra nice so that they don't mind so much having to be there. I mean their isn't that many places for teenagers to find work in Suprise is there?

They always have a lot of employees but nothing every seems to speed up. The lines, wait, and food take forever. Like everything though since the other one is inside a very busy Wal-Mart your better off waiting in line here.

All I have to say is Wow! I have no idea what happened here, if the owners realized the vast potential that this location had to make money or what. But this place is a lot better than I can remember.    For about 3-4 days I stopped by this McDonald's on my way to work, to either grab some coffee or a says mcmuffin. It took me sometimes less than 4 minutes to order my food,  pay, and leave the drive thru.  Before, I remember even going inside of the restaurant was always empty and slow as well as the drive thru. Which was the reason why I had stopped going and decided to buy coffee at the gas station.    The people are always super friendly. Someone I can say I am not at 7 a.m. in the morning. Glad they changed whatever they changed.

Not worth the money! My husband took his parents here after a couple reviews from family saying it was amazing, its not. The food was flavorless and the portions were a little small. If you want good Chinese food drive a little further to Good China on Thomas.

I stop here almost everyday I think the staff already knows me since I'm here so often. Their Costa Rican blend coffee is awesome., just add some half and half, and some caramel machiatto and your set. Way better than Starbucks plus you get to add as much of whatever you want, don't have to wait inline or anything.  Will definitely continue to come here as long as I live in Buckeye.

I'm at Pita Kitchen at least once a week, it is seriously that good. Their chicken entrees are really good if you've never had Mediterranean food before. The hummus is really good not sure if the pita is made there or if they buy it pre-made but it's good I always feel like you can't have enough.   If want to play it safe and try a little bit of the best just order the Combo Kabob entree, and get the hummus instead of the Greek salad. You'll thank me later. I don't know if I should be reviewing the gyros since I'm not a very big fan. The first time I was there I had Chicken Shawarma pita, it was really good, but I'm not a big fan. So I've never had them again not saying it's bad or anything.   The owners are also friendly the man which I think is the owner is always very polite and is whiling to explain anything. It seems to be family owned which is nice to still see.

Cafe 25:35 is something I would of totally not expected in Buckeye. The setting inside is just so adorable. I love the way the food is served when you get chips or fries. They're mocha's taste almost exactly like Dutch Bro Coffee, which is my favorite but can't enjoy it all the time due to their locations. Something that  I also really like is how instead of using lettuce in many of their dishes they'll use sprouts.

It's Jack in the Box just like any other franchise. The food tastes good just like it should I've heard that some Jack's have changed some of the ways things should be made. I've never had a problem with them or my order. They get you in an out just like it should be not very long wait time.

I was born in Culiacan and both of my parents are from there as well. So, it's safe say I know what good Mexican food is especially from this region. My favorite food made by my Mom are "Gorditas" they are very similar to "Sopes" for those that are more familiar with those. The only problem is that they're super time consuming so my Mom doesn't make them too often. So when I found out about this place I was excited. They taste a lot like my Mom so I kept coming.   I invited my co-worker to have lunch there and the lady that took our order noticed we were kind of in a hurry. She asked us if we had a place to be and once we told her we had to go back to work she told us that it would be better if next time we called her ahead of time so she could start cooking them before we got there so we wouldn't have to be in such a rush. Now that is customer service ! I was so happy when she told me that.   This place is extremely inexpensive as well we had six gorditas and two glass sodas total and we only paid twelve dollars. If we would of gone to the mexican place behind our work we would of easily paid at least twenty dollars for less food. Just the glass coke there is three dollars. So we won't mind driving a little further for better food and prices.

First, let me tell explain why the five stars were not given. I checked in online since it says the wait time would be less. So I checked in online for 11 a.m arrived 20 minutes earlier to fill out paper work and I still waited about an hour before being seen, including the time spent in the room waiting. I know waiting is all part of the American health system, but really?   I went in because I am 2 months pregnant and just couldn't get an appointment soon enough with my OBGYN, even though I hadn't been able to keep any food or liquids down for 2 days!   The front desk receptionist was very nice and seemed to get all of the information into their system quickly. Again I just wish they would tell you, "Your wait time will be around" instead of "They will be calling you shortly".   Finally,  I got to see one of the P.A's I believe and she asked about my symptoms and how I was feeling. She gave me some anti nausea pills to take whenever I felt nauseous.  At some point I did puke in their trash can and then asked for something to continue it on. One of the other nice gentlemen gave me a plastic container and put a pad on the bottom so it wouldn't splash back at me and that was very thoughtful.  I mean I already looked like a mess last thing I needed was vomit on myself.   The next day I woke up feeling a lot better than the past days, and to make matters even better I received a phone call to follow up on how I was doing. I really am glad I took the time and drive from Buckeye to this facility. I would recommend them to anyone who needs to be seen that someday but can't get a doctor's appointment.

I work behind this Thai restaurant, at first I was really upset when the old thai place closes but it's not bad at all. The portions are very good the staff treats you like family, and they also have very good lunch specials.

Never any complaints with this QT I was so excited to find out we were getting one in Buckeye. They have everything you need from a hot dog station, bakery station, chase ATM, and a huge drink selection. The staff is always friendly and make it a priority to get you checked out quick so you can hit the road.   The only problem with this location and maybe all QT's is the entrance to drive up to the.

I always order pizza from here when we're in the mood for pizza; rarely if ever. I have ordered through theirn online service every time and I've never had a problem. I have gone and picked up the pizza myself and have had it delivered, both times the staff has been nice.   Since I don't like many of the other pizza places around I will continue to order from here.  If no Peter piper pizza delivered.

I love Cracker Barrel they have something for everyone. Service is always friendly just once we had a problem where we had to move from our original table because they sat us down accidentally then they took over 8 min for us to get our drink order taken. We had to get the managers attention.   That will still not change my mind about how awesome this place is. We completely stopped going to IHOP and Denny's this place is so much better. Their blue berry muffin is one my favorites. Their pancakes are made out of cratch! I mean you don't get that out of a franchise.  It feels very cozy and welcoming.

Visited this Filiberto's sports grill twice, once during the first week of opening and the other probably a month after.   The do own up to the sports grill name they have tv's on almost ever inch of their walls and have all sorts of sport memberbilia. The space inside is fairly small so during the weekend it can get pretty busy and packed, and might not be ok for kids. The reason I say this is because of the way some women are dressed during the later times of the night.   They do offer some of the menu items that you can get at a Filiberto's, burritos, carne asada fries, and super nachos. As well as your typical bar food.   Over all it's a good place to go grab a beer and hang out.

Wow ia that drive thru packed after 5 p.m.!  It was way faster for me to just get off of my car and order inside. I got my order extremely fast. I even got out sooner than some of the cars that were at the the drive thru.    It was my husnand and my first time trying out this restaurant. We wanted to try it after my brother raved of it being the best. I got the 6 piece chicken fingers, it comes with: fries, Cole slaw, a piece of toast,  and cane sauce.  I thought it was a little in the pricey side. I didn't really enjoy the chicken with their sauce. I ate mine with the Louisiana hot sauce they have at the restaurant. If my husband or I are ever in the mood for "chicken fingers" we'll just stick to KFC not worth the drive from Buckeye.

You can ask any and they will tell you that I am not a Pizza fan at all. I mean I like a slice from time to time, but not my first choice.  I have bought pizza from here and I have bought dough balls to make my own pizza at home and it was also very good.   The people working there made sure we knew what we were buying when I asked for a dough ball to make pizza. They're fast and very nice.

Dutch Bros I need you in my life like EVERY DAY! I love them so much I've considered applying. I just don't have the super up beat personality required. Every time you go to Dutch Bros all the employees ways have a super friendly smile and ask about your day.   To top it off they have some of the best coffee ever. I hear a lot of people complaining about sizes and cost I personally find the prices to be ok. Especially since they offer drink stamps after 12 drinks you get one for free. Some days they even have "deals" if you buy a drink you get extra stamps.   Best coffee I do hope mot open in the West valley !

One of my biggest cravings during my pregnancy was a Raspado (shaved ice with unlimited choices of fruits) and our usual place closed for the winter. I was devastated! We tried another place and the quality was just not the same fruit was bad, some of the things in the raspado were stale. I had almost given up and thought I wouldn't have one until after having the baby.   Thanks to Yelp, I found this wonderful wonderful gem of a place. The staff is friendly and the location is clean. The fruit is fresh and everything is done right. I can't remember the appropriate name for what I had, but I will describe it.   A mango smoothie, the bottom of the cup had chamoy (tamarind sauce), it was topped off with fresh mangos and a tamarind candy stick and other tamarind candy. It's absolutely delicious. I hope to make a couple more trips here next with with my husband so he to can enjoy it!!

Finally I have found a taco stand to replace my old favorite. The tortillas are hand made so you won't get that sour tortilla taste that you get at some places. Everything is finely chopped which to me is a deal breaker.   I brought my Mom and sister here for a late lunch and we ordered 3 tacos, a quesadilla, gotta, & three drinks and only paid $18! For me that was a steal especially for the portions.  The quesadillas are pretty big and the tacos are just the right size. I will tell you this its in a sketchy area but you can always order them to go if you don't want to stay and eat there.   I will definitely be coming back soon.

The yogurt selection is not the biggest or the best compared to other yogurt shops, but I really liked what I tried. I don't know what the other people reviewing are talking about maybe I'm not a yogurt expert?   What they lack in the yogurt selection they make up in the vast amount of toppings. Not only do that have a lot of toppings to chose from, but their fruit tastes a lot fresher.  I had the coconut yogurt with mango, and coconut shavings (I know sounds weird but I'm pregnant) and it was delicious.   The store is also very clean, and the staff is friendly. They don't have a lot of seats inside, but neither do other yogurt shops.   Overall, this is something Buckeye needed healthier options for staying cool. And I will be coming back again as long as the coconut flavor stays. : ) Maybe add a cheesecake flavor as well.

Service was fantastic! You walk in they greet you and if your dining in you get seated and someone comes and hands you a menu. The place is very clean and the people are very nice.   The food is nothing but bland. I really wanted to give this place a shot after reading all of the great reviews. But it fell very very short from all of that.  We ordered the beef and chicken kabob combo comes with rice and hummus/salad, feta fries, and a drink. Our total was $18 which is not bad for Greek good.   The rice was so bland it didn't taste like anything but the water they made it in. The pita was a little on the dry side but served it purpose. The hummus I didn't even touch. My husband says he's had the canned hummus and that's what it tasted like. The chicken wasn't anything special and the only thing I ate a side from the fries. The beef kabob was very squishy and had a weird texture and also had no flavor. The feta fries were just that I don't know why I was expecting more. It was just French fries with pepper and a little bit of crumbled feta on top.   I wish I could give it more stars but I can't. I would never eat here again.
