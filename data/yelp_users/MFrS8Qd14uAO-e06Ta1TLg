I'm so glad we decided to try Hiro Sushi! For the past few years I've been very disappointed in Phoenix-area sushi restaurants. Hiro isn't just good for the area; it compares well to restaurants in other cities, too.  Hiro is a small, quiet restaurant done up in dark, sophisticated colors. Even when the restaurant was full, the atmosphere was relaxing. There were a few families there, but it would still be a good place for a date.   I'm incredibly picky about the freshness of fish, most of all when I'm eating it raw, and I've passed this on to my family. If you feel the same way, you'll be happy to learn that none of us had any complaints in this area.  Hiro's portions are large, which is great if you love shashimi. In fact, my favorite item was the salmon sashimi. Hiro had some truly beautiful salmon last night, and it tasted even better than it looked! The tuna sashimi was also served generously and it was very good.   The nigiri items we ordered were ikura (salmon eggs), ika (squid), suzuki (bass) and unagi (eel.) The suzuki is usually prepared with ponzu (a cirtus vinegar) but you can get it without. Unagi is usually barbequed, but they offered it to my husband in two different ways. I can't remember what the other way was, but he ordered the barbequed, and he and my daughter said it was delicious. (I could taste that one because it wasn't gluten-free; same with the ikura, which my daughter, the ikura fan, said were good.) I'm the squid fan, and since you see I've given Hiro five stars, you know I enjoyed their squid!  I'd like to make special note about the edamame. At most restaurants this popular appetizer is treated with the same care as the free chips you get at a cheap Mexican joint. There's a lot of overcooked edamame in this town! At Hiro, ALL of the edamame in our three large bowls were bright and crispy. You didn't see salt on the outside of the pods, but they must have seasoned them in some way, because the peas inside were mildly salty and seemed to have some other flavors, too.   Hiro takes reservations, and on the weekends you should make one. We went early on a Saturday (6pm) and wanted to sit at the sushi bar, so we were okay, but all the tables were already reserved, and within a half hour of our arrival all the tables were filled, and the sushi bar, too.  We'll definitely be back!  UPDATE JULY 2015: We HAVE been back to Hiro Sushi, and it's always been great.

We had a terrible experience at the Comerica Theatre last night, and we definitely weren't the only ones. We were in the audience for a live taping of the radio show "Wait! Wait! Don't tell me!" and the echoes produced by the sound system were so terrible that it was difficult, and often impossible, to understand what was being said onstage.  The very, very beginning of the show was fine. Then, suddenly, everything said onstage was repeated in a big, booming echo coming from the back of the theatre. We were on the extreme end of the auditorium, stage left, close to the stage, so when it wasn't resolved in a few minutes, I grabbed a security guard, who relayed the message to someone else. The sound got worse for a while, then back to it's original form of bad.  People in our section began to get up and go to the lobby to complain. Halfway into the show we were still missing at least half of what was happening on stage, so my husband got up to find someone. When he returned, he said there were many people in the lobby complaining about the sound, mostly people sitting at the sides of the auditorium, like we were.  We had really been looking forward to seeing our favorite radio show performed live, and my husband bought really good seats as a Christmas present to me. We are extremely unhappy about our experience.   Another problem with the Comerica theatre was whatever happened to delay everyone's entrance into the building. My husband and I arrive just before showtime, expecting to rush in to our seats. We were surprised to find huge crowds waiting outside, with a massive line at Will Call, and no particular direction for the way we were supposed to enter. We had seen many shows at this facility when it was the Dodge Theatre, and I never remember anything like this. It wasn't so bad for us, because by the time we arrive people were finally getting in, but I know the crowd who were there earlier were very unhappy about having to cool their heels outdoors.  I doubt that "Wait! Wait! Don't tell me!" will ever tape there again. The host apologized to the crowd for the late start because the people were just getting into the theatre (although it certainly wasn't HIS fault!) and he made some jokes about the bad acoustics, so he must have realized that some of us were struggling with them. It must have sounded terrible to him onstage. Oh, and they had a stage-monitoring problem too; when they brought up audience members, they couldn't hear things that were being said on another part of the stage!  I left a message with the management, but I haven't heard anything back. We definitely will not return to the Comerica Theatre until we hear that they've fixed their sound problems.

If you ever have problems with your Apple computer, don't bother to go to the Apple store in the mall. Go straight to MacMedia! The mall stores can't retrieve your data. They'll give you a list of local places that can -- and tell you it's probably hopeless and expensive. Don't believe them! MacMedia retrieved all my data after my hard drive failed, and it wasn't expensive at all. Then they installed a new hard drive, put all my data back on my computer exactly the way it was, and set up a Time Machine drive for me so I won't lose my stuff if something even worse happens to my computer. They do the repairs right there in their store. The people are nice, you don't need an appointment, and they have a wide variety of accessories for Mac and Apple products.
