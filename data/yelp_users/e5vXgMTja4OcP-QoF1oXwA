This place is great! We sat at the bar (are you starting to see a trend in my reviews??) and the bartenders were cool. I ordered bartenders choice because i was feeling froggy. The bartender asked me some questions on my preferences and whipped me up something scrumptious. We had a few appetizers - I recommend the n'dja and the pig ears... super tasty, I'm not joking either!   We will be back, maybe one day I will try and sit in the dining room.

I really debated about writing this review. So many good and bad things to say the food was good - but just that, portions were skimpy on somethings and heavy on others, bread came out cold and barely toasted, side salads were only greens which just looked sad on a plate all by themselves. For a $20 entree a piece of fish and some lettuce is ridiculous. Muscles were ice cold and there were only about 10 in a big bowl so it looked horrible and instantly cooled off the muscles which had no garnish, barely any sauce and cold bread. Flat bread was delicious, Cheese platter was a good mix of meats and cheeses but still underwhelming. Wine list was good, red sangria good and beer selection good but a lot of heavier beers for summer time.  What really bothered me was my sisters fish came out raw. Not just sort of under cooked, were talking barely touched on the grill. Honestly, it happens no big deal! We kindly asked our server if we could get the fish cooked a little more and she happily agreed. She took it to the cook ( a younger gentleman) and asked him to re fire, He then grabbed the plate and said " what does she want me to f*#king burn it?" Nosh is a small restaurant with an open kitchen where sound travels. My sister was immediately embarrassed and felt horrible. Not how you want to be treated when spending over $200 on a meal. To add insult to injury it appears their method for fixing the issue was to get us a free $6 dessert that we had no intentions of ordering anyways. Gee thanks. I told the server quietly that I had over heard the Cook talking about our table and I got a genuine I am sorry and then she said " you know chefs". Why yes, yes I do know chefs, I have worked with them for over 12 years and I would be embarrassed if that happened on my watch.   I doubt we will be back.

First tip: Sit at the counter, watch the chefs. The vibe is really cool and if your an industry person you will have a great time (even if your not you will get a kick out of it all) The gentleman who helped us was knowledgeable and very professional. He knew when to offer advice and when to just let us enjoy the show. I give him 5 stars for sure.  Food was excellent and fresh. We wanted to try as many items as we could and we were not disappointed with anything! We stared with oysters, couldn't tell you which ones, we went with our servers recommendation. Yum!! We then got the appetizer with king crab meat served in a mason jar of clarified butter... I wanted to drink the deliciousness when I was done stuffing my face with king crab meat. The grilled bread served with it was simple and tasty. Then we had the Scallop Crudo, another home run but not as memorable as our entree the Bouillabaisse. By far the best thing we had that night. So much flavor - even if it was a tad over salted. Ask for more bread with this one, your going to want to slop up all that saucy goodness...don't be shy... you know you want to.

Love this place. Good service, tasty food and a fun atmosphere.   The drinks are AMAZEBALLS... Omg. Plus $5 for a pitcher of delicious brew before 5 pm makes this my go to weekend lunch spot. Salsa's have a lot a flavor and good heat and the tacos are delicious. I was not impressed with the Chicken Tinga, it was just OK, the fish taco's are wonderful and the tortillas are handmade. The tortilla soup is really tasty as well, it can be a little to thick, but has great flavor. You have to order the cheese y mas... oh buddy. I could eat that all day erry day!  Overall, you should go here - belly up to the bar, the bartenders are fun and the service is great.

Great spot for a date, girls night or just because you feel like eating GREAT food and sipping on a super fantastical cocktail. Me and some girlfriends went for dinner and were not disappointed. The Chef came to the table which was a great treat!   I will be coming back here just as often as I can!

Great place! They were backed up and came out to the car to take our order. However they brought no menus (sad face) then I felt bad because I couldn't order properly. Love that they had car service but bring menus out!!!

Went to this place last week and caught their awesome happy hour. Beer selection was good, but as an avid Craft Beer drinker I could have used a few better options. The decor is cool and nestled into a strip mall in Gilbert this was not at all what I was expecting.  We sat at the bar right by the steam pots and the chef working was friendly and I was really blown away by the cleanliness of the line and the overall restaurant. We got the lobster Mac and Cheese and it was great, could have used a pinch more salt but I really enjoyed it and it was huge!! We got Oysters as well to start and I could tell they were good and fresh, then we split the Cioppino  for an entree. It was really tasty, especially after adding a good scoop of their homemade hot sauce, YUM! My only complaint was that the bread served with it was bleh. It tasted old, and was a product that tasted par baked then finished in the oven. When I have a soupy Cioppino, I like a great piece of grilled bread to soak up all the yums.   I cannot wait to come back for reverse happy hour and also to try more from the menu. I hope this place does well, its nice to have a great seafood spot so close to home. Overall I suggest you try it!
