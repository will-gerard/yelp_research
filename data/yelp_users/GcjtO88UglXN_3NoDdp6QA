The food and service was incredible. Loved the atmosphere, as well. The waitress was incredibly knowledgeable about every dish. We ordered almost all of her recommendations and everything was delicious. I would strongly recommend eating here. This is one of the best restaurants that I have eaten at and I am definitely looking forward to going back.

Great location, but the service was the worst I have ever experienced. Waited approximately 20 minutes to even have our order taken. One person in our party did not even receive their order. We eventually asked for the manager when the food wasn't brought. He proceeded to tell us to, "Calm the fuck down". He also argued with us about when we ordered and rolled his eyes when we tried to explain the situation. Waitress brought our checks before bringing other items we ordered and completely forgot about them. We were also over charged. I couldn't imagine a worse experience. I do not recommend at all.
