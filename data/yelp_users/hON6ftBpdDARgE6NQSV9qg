Amazing sushi. My family (extended included) have been coming here for years and it's never disappointed. The School Bus roll and the Vegas roll are our favorites. The teppanyaki is always delicious as well. The atmosphere is so fun and is great for casual dining or for a special event. The staff is always very friendly and seem to remember us. Always a great time and always leave satisfied.

I understand it's a busy weekend being a holiday weekend. We tried to call in an order and ended up waiting on hold for 27 minutes so we decided to drive there instead and order. I didn't get the name of the manager who was working (brunette, probably late 30s early 40s) but she made everything better and comped the meal for us. I felt terrible complaining cause we go there often and they usually have such great service but to be on hold for almost 30 minutes and then go to find nobody at the counter when we show up for a minute...She provided great customer service to redeem the slack of the servers.

We decided to come here for the first time. We had drove by a bunch, but never actually stopped in. We would've been better off saving our money and just spending $10 at the grocery store in the freezer isle. Everything is bland, hard, and mostly batter compared to the fish or shrimp inside. The only good thing is the sauce but that's cause sauce can mask any crappy food. Never again...So so so disappointed!

Our insurance company sent them to us on two different occasions when we needed roadside assistance, and BOTH TIMES THEY DIDNT SHOW!!!   The first time my husband was stuck in a storm on the side of the road and waited 3 HOURS AND NOBODY SHOWED! He was in my mother's car so when she got to her car and could use her AAA, a tow company showed within 10 minutes!!  This time we have a broken down vehicle we need to transport to our mechanic, and the tow company said they'd be here around 12. 1 & 1/2 later and they still aren't here! We called 45 mins ago to check and they had every excuse. The weather (it barely stormed for an hour in the middle of the night), it's a holiday weekend (it's Monday), he'll be here soon, etc. They might as well have talked out their asses.   We called Progressive and asked them to please make a note of how terrible this company is!!  PS: When the new tow company called to confirm, they asked what happened with the previous company and we said they never showed up, he asked us "Sun City Towing huh?"   Update: The guy from Sun City towing just showed up even though we cancelled 20 minutes ago. Great communication guys....

I love Dominos so I order for them before anyone but literally EVERY time we order, they forget something or mess something up. And best yet, when I emailed the "manager/owner", TWICE...I never once received a response. If it weren't for the fact that Dominos pizza is the best for us that's closeted, they have disappointed us too many times and we would not be ordering from them again if my husband didn't dislike the "competition". How hard is it to remember a side of icing or sauce?! I wouldn't mind if you didn't make me pay for them to begin with...

So disappointed. I love Hungry Howie's and haven't ordered from here before because my husband doesn't care for them, and I'm always trying to convince him to give them a shot. I placed an online order of a medium pizza, a small pizza, and a roll. I ordered at 2:01 and it was delivered at 3:12. I had to call the store and speak to someone, and he informed me the driver had left and should be there. He said he'd check on the driver and to call back in a few minutes. In that time, I could've drove there (if I had access to my car at the moment). When the delivery guy finally showed, the pizza was barely warm. So bummed cause I am starving and was looking forward to being able to eat without having to reheat my food first.

I usually don't care to go to this Starbucks because of the cattiness of some of the female baristas. But thank god for this girl today! I didn't catch her name, but she's tall, tan, dark curly hair, and just SUCH a calming aura to her!! The whole reason I was popping in there was to try to gain a split-second moment of peace and sanity from my day, and she just helped that much more some how. Also, when she learned my second drink order was for my husband, she asked if she could write a cute "I heart you!!" On the cup to be from me to him..I thought that was just the cutest little random idea to perk up the drink/moment/my husband. Thanks for making my day Starbucks :)

After our last visit being disappointing, the owner contacted me and offered to make things right. Another example of why I feel this place is so great! (Besides their delish food!!)

Our family frequents here and it's our personal favorite. The food is always awesome and the staff is always really friendly. I prefer their pizza to anyone else around.

We went there with our toddler and sat at the sushi bar. Our server, Amanda, was super sweet and very helpful. We ordered the Vegas roll, Lobster roll, and Cherry Blossom roll. We didn't say very long cause of the kid but Amanda was very understanding and helped us hurry up on out of there with boxes and our check. Reasonable price for the food, and our 3 year old loved the sushi as well. It's becoming our favorite nearby sushi spot, and our server Amanda made the visit the best of all the times we've been there. We'll be requesting her from now on :)

I wasted all day yesterday browsing the mall and show stores looking for a specific type of shoe. I found the shoes I needed right away at DSW! I found them online, called in to double check they had them in stock like it said online and they did. Stephen helped me out and held the shoes for me. Great and easy service!

My husband called this morning and made an appointment for 12:30 for a father/son special for him and our 4 year old. We were so excited cause it's was going to be our son's 1st time getting his hair cut by someone other than Grandma.   We show up for our appointment @ 12:30 and all 3 barbers were busy with clients. Ok, that understandable. One of the guys tells us to just take a seat in the seating area so we do. 10 minutes later we are still waiting. As soon as one guy finished up, a regular walked in and sat right in the empty seat and started to get worked on. Here we are, still waiting and wondering what is going on...So my husband asks the assistant lady who is cleaning up and mentions we have an appointment and she said "Oh well good thing you told me now." And proceeds to tell the barbers we have an appointment, only for one of them to replay "Good for him!"  We had heard such great things about this place, and felt completely disrespected the whole 20 minutes we were there. There was NO customer service on our "experience".  We made the drive out to the V's Barbershop at Happy Valley & I-17 instead.

So we ordered the honey mango shrimp, and we properly refrigerated it that evening, ate it the next day and got so sick for 4 days we couldn't even keep water down or in. After complaining to them, they said that's our fault because their stuff "cant be reheated". And the time after, when we decided to give them another chance (stupidly) they made us wait 30 mins longer than they had originally said and when I had mentioned how last time my family got sick off their stuff, they said I'm sorry and then gossiped and laughed at us....Class customer service.

They've gotten a lot better with service. Food is always right and delivered quickly and always delicious! We've tried the other places and keep coming back to China Grill, they are the best.

Sat on the patio with my toddlers, brother, and mom. Our server was Ressia and she was amazing! We are a very high maintenance group with our constant requests and whatnot. We know we aren't the easiest table but Ressia went above and beyond serving us. She was always there to check on us or see if we needed anything. Also the fact that she interacted so well with the kids was a bonus. She was such a doll.   The food was delicious as always. I decided to try something new and had the Chipotle Chicken Lavosh pizza. I was not disappointed!! Even my family kept asking to eat some of my newest discovery.   This location is one of the better ones in my opinion. It's always such a clean and welcoming environment. Can't wait till next time!

I have heard so highly of this place so I finally tried it and my god...nothing disappointed!! The bruschetta board was amazing. I could've downed the whole thing by myself. I have been literally dreaming of their food since and I can't wait to go back and have my husband experience it. Definitely in my top 3 favorite restaurants.

I'm addicted to their seafood soup and combo platters. Great unique food for an affordable price. Love this place for a lunch spot or quick to go dinner.

Checked out Timo's for the first time yesterday. Fell in love with the Brie soup and salmon small plate. My only complaint is that they are so far! ;)

Went here earlier this evening to get dinner for my husband and I. There was a little confusion with a new girl knowing which breads went for which sandwiches, (which they were out of all but wheat or sourdough..I wouldn't have gone if I had known that). But I can completely understand that happening with being new & not fully knowing the menu. (I've been in that spot many times.) Towards the end I ordered a soup and roll with our order, and the manager told me to pay with the cashier and she'd give it to us in a minute (she was getting it ready). Nope. I had so much other on my order to check on I hadn't noticed. Later, I get home only to notice I am missing the soup snd roll. They supplied me with the extra tortilla chips but not the actual dish. I drove all the way back and thankfully they remembered me and gave it to me free and blamed it on miscommunication, no problems at all. They (almost) fully redeemed themselves on that part! But on a huge note, the two times I was there this evening, the young, longer haired brunette girl on salad bar had the attitude of "you're annoying/pain in the ass/I have better things to do". My husband wanted me to get more salad for him while there, and I didn't, just to avoid her really crappy attitude after the crappy day I've had. Sorry us costumers that came here for a nice meal had to be such a burden to you're difficult day. We didn't mean to be such a pain in your ass while you're getting paid! I've had enough happen for this week with putting our dog down and other personal stuff, the last thing we needed was this girls guilt trip attitude..This girl kept it from being 5 stars though. The food and service are otherwise amazing!!

Visited this place for the first time last night. They were pretty empty inside. We ordered 4 different sushi rolls, Las Vegas roll (usually my favorite roll, this place's roll was slightly smaller than others I've tried but was still very good!), the Golden Sunshine roll (couldn't believe how good it was!), a yellowtail roll (my husband's...said it was pretty good) and also a spicy tuna roll (my husband loved). Overall, the food was really delicious! The service was a little slow but still very good. This place definitely will be our new go to spot for sushi.
