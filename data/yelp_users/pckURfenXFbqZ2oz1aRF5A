WTF! No idea what happened to this place. This was our jam.. but no more.  I t was my daughter's sweet 16. I told her to pick her spot, the only caveat was she could choose whatever she wanted.  She picked Uncle Sam's. Typically that would be great...but tonight,  everything was horrible!   It started when we walked in. They tried to cram a party of six into a four top...the meatballs AND wings were burned..the service was non existent (until it was time to tip) ..missing food orders...no manager in sight.  I could go on, but I think you get it.  Oh and the arrogance...I said I would stop so I will.  We are done here. If you are nearby, pick something else.  AJ

This place is just consistent. Been a fan for years and am not sure why it is not in our regular rotation. But, I have had the opportunity to lunch here the past two Fridays. Our server Audrey was fantastic as always. Try the bacon wrapped shrimp brochettes and sausage/seafood gumbo, of course.

This place is always rock solid.  I tried something new today, Pineapple Curry, heat level 5.  Very good, but I will do it with chicken instead of shrimp next time.  There are better Thai places in the valley, but this place is consistently great and close to home.

Ocean Prime never disappoints. Had dinner here with a couple of friends last night. Service is always good, especially in the bar area. Love lounging over dinner or heavy apps while enjoying some live music and a game or two on TV.  Everything on the menu is very good.  Love a little surf and turf and a couple of excellent cocktails.

Thank you Yelp!  It is quite a task to find a good BBQ place in the North Valley and without you guys, we wouldn't have found this place.  Very friendly staff and great pork.    The sauces are not my favorite, but that is just me. Mac and Cheese rocks.  Planning to introduce some friends next weekend.

Not only was this place my favorite food in the area, it was the best Chinese food I ever had...but no more.  Unfortunately, Jade appears to be on its way out.  The food isn't fresh anymore and it seems that corners are being cut in other areas.  Too bad! We are running out of options up here.

Shadow's is the best place for scotch and a stick! There aren't many INDOOR venues left in the valley where you can enjoy cigars AND cocktails (I can think of 3). It is a great spot to meet with the boys and enjoy a Cloud Summit. They have a nice selection of cigars and have no problem with your bringing your own. It is tucked away in the perfect location within Talking Stick Resort, set off to the side next to the parking garage.  The service is always excellent, Patrick and Angela are absolutely the BEST!

I have been trying for over a week to contact Doug for quote.  Not sure if messages from the website are not being relayed to him properly or what is going on. But, the unresponsiveness has definitely put me in a bind for a ride to a concert this weekend.

Come on Ak Chin/Ashley Furniture/Cricket/Blockbuster/Desert Sky Pavilion get it together.  I realize you have been a concert mecca for decades, but tonight seemed like your first concert evet!  It took an hour to get in to the concert...that was just to park...then 30 minutes in line to get in the door.  Leaving was worse! We were in the south parking lot, apparently an afterthought lot, and it took more than an hour and thirty minutes  to get out.  WE LITERALLY DID NOT MOVE IN OUR VEHICLE FOR 45 MINUTES!! Thank you for ruining a perfectly good night. I hope that tour mangers and bands seeking venues in Phoenix look elsewhere.   I will certainly pass on shows here in the future.

Dropped in with my baby girl late on a Friday.  Kitchen was about 30 minutes from closing, but they were still very happy to seat and serve us. The staff is excellent!  They know their food and communicate with their customers very well.  The food is fantastic!  Not traditional by any means, but very fresh and tasty.  Had the Kimchee Fried Rice with Chicken.  It was so good, I ordered a second one to go.  My daughter wasn't feeling very adventurous, so we asked if we could order the Koi Burger off the HH menu.  They were happy to oblige and wow, am I glad they did.  If you are fortunate enough to be in the area between 3-6 p.m. you will be thrilled with this menu item. It is cooked perfectly, garnished with Kimchee, and killer mayo.  Then the topper....served on a full size King's Hawaiian bun!  Man it is soooo good! We are planning a return visit very soon.  Great job guys!

I visited Grassroots for the first time about six months ago.  Since then I have returned many times.  Often going out of my way and past many other great restaurants to do so.  I am so glad they decided to steal the Brussel Sprouts Appetizer from their sister restaurant Twisted Grove.  I really didn't know I was a Brussel Sprout fan until I had this gem!  Brussel Sprouts, Roasted Garlic, Candied Bacon, with a Balsamic Drizzle, I am salivating as I write this.  If you like fresh food and great service, you will definitely no be disappointed.
