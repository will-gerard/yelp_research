This has nothing to do with the techs at all.  I am sure that they are all great BUT as far as their billing department goes they SUCK!!  I have had to fight claim after claim with them even though they have everything needed to resend the claim back to my insurance.  They are lazy over there and don't know how to do their job. I wish my kids doctors office did not use them but there is nothing I can do.  All I can say is a warning to all you out there if you get a bill from them call your insurance company before paying it. Chances are it is a covered lab and it was billed incorrectly.

Don't go here.  Dr Brinki is all about pulling teeth and in with the ortho next door.  The office is fun and kid friendly and that is about all that it has going for them.

Such an amazing dentist and staff.  We were one of the first to start at this office when it opened and would not go anywhere else.  Dr Tovar does such a great job and is so caring.  I also moved my children to him and they get so much better care then they did going to a pediatric dentist.  Their cleanings are just as in depth as mine.  I love knowing they are getting the best care possible.

Finding an office of more than one doctor you trust to handle your kids health is hard. But I was truly bless when I found Dr Agarwal and his amazing practice.  My children feel very safe and secure with every doctor we have seen. Their front office staff is very polite and friendly to the parents and children. The office manager is very fast to get anything that may arise handled. This office is the way to go!
