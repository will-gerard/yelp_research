So I do not like writing bad reviews, but I felt this time I needed to. Went there last Saturday and the sales person sold me on a suit jacket that I wanted for New Year's Eve.  They didn't have my size and even at the write size, would need a little tailoring...I know it was short notice, but the sales person assured me that the jacket would be in the Tuesday before and would be tailored in time for New Year's Eve. I did not receive the call telling me it was in until NYE and would not have time to be tailored. Good thing I went shopping elsewhere and found a jacket. I returned the jacket without a problem, but I was severely disappointed with that sales person. I am getting married and getting the tuxes there as well, which made me think twice about continuing with my order with them.

US Airway never fails to have delays through CLT. First the flight is delayed due to "air traffic congestion" then the flight is delayed yet again due to maintenance issues THEN another delay past another flight that's headed to the same location. Would make sense to me to give the passengers the working plane first thereby only having a 2 hour delay and delay the other passengers by 30 minutes. This airline needs better management or updated equipment. Would not recommend using this airline unless desperate.

Yet again severely disappointed in how US Airways handles their business. Poorly operated, poor customer service representatives, and over-all lack of commitment to the patrons that frequent their business. Yet more delays without a good reason behind them and with no plan in place to resolve said delays. I would recommend paying a higher price for flights with their competitors as at least Delta, Southwest, and United are much easier to work with.

If you live by this McDonalds you'd get better service driving further. It seems the drive-thru staff need not be educated. After repeating myself multiple times (due to previous mistakes) they still got my order wrong. I know it's just fast food, but you should at least expect some sort of decent service.

This is a great new gem in Old Town Scottsdale. Wine from southern AZ now within minutes of Phoenix metro area. The Reds are my favorite with the Petite Sirah being by far my favorite of the tasting.
