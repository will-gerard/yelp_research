Went here for breakfast today. Waited in line and got up to the register.   The gal at the register asked what we'd like to order. After telling her our entire order, she forgot everything we said and had to repeat it. Then, she asked for clarification on something. As we answered her, she got sidetracked in another conversation and we had to repeat what we said again. She kept complaining about how distracted she was and "didn't know what was going on in this world". Ordering took 2x longer than it should have.   We proceeded to find a table and were excited for our meal. After waiting about half an hour, we asked for an update on our food. The cooks told us they were just starting it and had a "large backup" even though the restaurant was relatively slow.   After waiting 10 more minutes for our food, our breakfast tacos finally arrived. Except, they were just omelettes. Nothing "taco" about it. We could've gone anywhere for omelettes.   We asked a waitress for a manager, who never showed up.   We finally got up and found the manager ourselves. The manager was understanding, but spoke in a confrontational way and pretty much said "I know there is a problem, but deal with it. The last customer waited 50 minutes for their food, so your wait wasn't even that long."  All in all, we won't be back. Ditsy, clueless cashiers; insane wait time; inaccurate menu descriptions, uncaring owner.
