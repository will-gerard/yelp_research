This place used to be great but the new owners are running it into the ground. Too bad.

Absolutely love their sandwiches! ! Bread is delicious!   Pizza is dine for the price. If you get the garlic butter crust it adds a lot to the flavor. Personel are always very friendly!

We have tried many Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area and we both agreed this was by FAR the best!!  I had the butter chicken and saag paneer and  paneer naan.  Everything was served very hot and fresh and was just delicious!  I can't wait to go back and try their buffet and was happy to hear it is also served on the weekends.  Our waitress was very friendly and the manager came over to make sure we were happy with our meal as well.  Will definitely be back!!
