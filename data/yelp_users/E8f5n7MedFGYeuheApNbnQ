Great country band on Wednesdays and lots of TVs for sports on the weekend. The pretzel is good and so are the duck fat fries. Can't wait to come back.

Great food, grilled cheese is a must. Best patio in Scottsdale. Their Sangria was my favorite. Awesome service.

Paul the manager was rude. Simple questions about the drinks had to come sarcastic answers. Food was blan.
