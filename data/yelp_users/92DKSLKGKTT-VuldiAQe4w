My favorite comic shop in Glendale hands down. These guys love comics and the store shows. The store is extremely organized which is huge for me as I like to find what I want and go. They have everything you could want from comics, trades, local comics, and action figures.  The staff is always extremely helpful as well.

Bought a 2007 jetta from these guys in 2010. Made a deal of $14,000 for it and whoopsie me, I didn't read the fine print well enough and they jacked that price up to $21,000 by charging me for radio, tires, etc which were used on the car.   THEN the transmission went out after only six months of driving it. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

After the horrible experience I had at Chapman Volkswagen in Scottsdale, I decided to get my oil changed here. The service technician let me know that their synthetic oil changes were twenty dollars cheaper than what I was paying and he was very friendly. Plus, it could take two hours for me to get an oil change at Chapman while here it only took thirty minutes and they after they informed me that my battery was running low they took me out to the garage to show me on the meter what it was telling them. The most honest dealership I have ever dealt with.

Worst place for shows. You're basically paying to get your ass kicked by security. It's one thing to tell people they have to leave it's another to put them in a chokehold and drag them out the door violently. Avoid this place.

My favorite venue.  We don't have any good venues on the west side so I'll willingly drive thirty minutes out of my way to come here.  It's an all around great venue with the big shows being upstairs ( The Nile) and the smaller, more intimate shows downstairs (The Underground).   The staff are great and treat the musicians insanely well which is rare in this state.  From the perspective of an audience member and musician who has played and gone to shows at this venue for years I'd recommend going to a show out at this place or booking a show here.
