I had driven past Giant Hamburgers for years until one day my dad suggested we try it out. And I'm SO glad we did. It's become our go-to hamburger place. You can order your burger however you like it (bacon, cheese and mayo for me)... and their fries are some of the best in town. Nice and crispy!  And like other people have mentioned, the grilled cheese is quite excellent as well.  I don't know if I'd call the hamburgers "giant"... but I've NEVER left this restaurant hungry. Ever. And I make sure I always come in with a hearty appetite.   Never had breakfast or pie here... but they have both. Maybe next time I'll try out some pie.

This Fuddruckers location is just down the street from where I live... so I've been here on quite a few occasions. However, the whole "exotic" burgers they've been promoting the past month or so have gotten me more excited to visit them. I was really looking forward to trying an ostrich burger... but alas, ostrich isn't in season until November. I ordered a wild boar burger instead.  It was quite tasty. I got it with pepper jack cheese and bacon (because topping of wild pig with more pig just made sense)... and it was quite filling. :)   I've never been disappointed with service at this location. So yay for Fuddruckers!

I... don't get it. I don't get the high rating on this restaurant. Sorry, guys.   When we arrived, the parking lot was packed, but once inside we were seated almost immediately out on the patio. Unfortunately, we were not seated with menus. Our server visited our table twice before correcting this error. One of our salsa bowls arrived at our table with caked on food bits. After ordering our food, we waited almost an hour for our entrees... which were sincerely lacking in yum.  I ordered the Faja Pasta - so maybe it's partially my own fault for order a pasta dish at a Mexican restaurant - but it was not very good. The pasta was very doughy, and many of the noodles were clumped together. The bread it came with, while not awful, was partially soggy from sitting on the plate too long. Saving grace was the chicken I had with it. It was juicy and had a nice kick. One star for the chicken.  Fiance ordered a seafood enchilada which he found lacking in seafood and smothered in too much cheese.   We ate until we were full enough to call it a meal. As unsatisfying as it was.   Second star is for our server, because even though he was a smidge on the slow side, he was trying, bless his heart. He refilled my soda before it was completely empty, so that's a plus for me.   I don't think we'll be returning.

I am quite surprised nobody has ever gone here and reviewed this on Yelp. It's been open to the public for as long as I can remember. My mom has volunteered here for about that long as well.  If you're a fan of Victorian homes, local history, or even just history in general then you should definitely check out the Petersen House. It's just as beautiful on the inside as it is on the outside.  Unfortunately, it's closing to the public VERY soon because the city just can't afford to keep it running... but they should re-open it around Christmas time for Danish Christmas. So if you aren't lucky enough to swing by in the next week or so... come back around Christmas!

I know my boyfriend hates that I love Taco Bell so much (being the evil fast food chain conglomerate that it is), but it's food I grew up with... and I still love it.   Been going to this location for as long as I remember... sometimes they mess up my order, most times they don't. I imagine turnover is pretty fast here, so it's unfair to judge them on just 1 or 2 visits. For the most part, this Taco Bell has been great. Clean facilities.   This location also does the 3 free tacos (with the purchase of a large drink) when the Diamondbacks score 6 or more runs. :D

Dr. Nowicki has been my family's vet for as long as I remember. He is great with our cats (and so is his entire staff). When something is wrong, he explains all your options to you. And when it comes to putting an animal down, it's always done with so much understanding and sympathy.  I can't imagine taking my animals to another vet.

Just got back from eating lunch here with my dad... and I can safely say that I won't have to eat anything for the rest of the day...possibly the rest of the weekend.   The Bacon Cheddar Stuffed Burger I got was HUGE. It came to the table buried in lettuce, onion and tomato (which I promptly removed) as well as pickles (which I left on). I ate almost the whole burger before being tempted by a piece of Banana Cream Pie (which was AMAZING).   My only negative is I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked... and I got it a little rarer than I usually like my beef. Thankfully, the melty, gooey cheese made me forget about the pinkness of the burger.  All in all, I would recommend this place for you hungry carnivores out there. Come with an appetite. I guarantee you'll be stuffed by the time you leave.

Maybe I'm still mourning the loss of J Ruggs, my favourite BBQ place that went out of business last July... but I came into Joe's today hoping to find a replacement pulled pork sandwich that I could love just as much. It wasn't here at Joe's.   My boyfriend ordered brisket, sausage and cheesy potatoes - all of which I sampled. The sausage was probably my favourite (and I ended up eating 90% of it off his plate)... but I felt like the cheesy potatoes were under seasoned. Maybe I just like potatoes salty.  Also - not a huge fan of the soda machine placement. When the line was long, I felt bad trying to squeeze through just to refill my drink.  I'm not saying the food was awful... but it just wasn't what I was looking for. The pulled pork sandwich hunt continues. :(

Would have gone back to try more of their food, but did not feel welcomed AT ALL by the waitress. Hubby's (Nam's) review pretty much says it all. Except I didn't think our appetizers really took THAT long to come out. Shame that our experience was like that, but Handlebar's is just down the road and our experience there was light years better.

My last review got deemed as a fake, so I'm writing up another review... because I genuinely love this place.  My dad & I used to drive past this place all the time, because it's between my apartment and his house. Then one day (after lots of "we should stop and eat there sometime"), we stopped in. Their food is good. We keep coming back on a fairly regular basis.  Their baked potato soup is my hands down favourite. I order it nearly every time we visit... and often find myself craving it at odd hours of the night. It's got the perfect blend of salty and creamy and the potato bits in it are nice and big. It's a good, hearty soup that fills me up every time.  My other favourites here are Thrill of the Grill (though I always order it without the guacamole), Chicken Swiss Melt, and Roast Beef & Provolone.  I've never eaten here for breakfast, because I'm not a big breakfast person... so maybe their breakfast menu is as awful as everybody here is claiming... but I can't see how.

I adopted my kitty, Kesse, from here back in 2006... she was really shy and scared at first, but she has become the sweetest most loving cat I have ever owned.  I feel so blessed to have rescued her.  Late last year, I brought my friend here who had been looking for a cat (and failing) via the internet. She ended up adopting an 8 month old tabby and couldn't be happier.  The staff is super friendly, and will open a cage for you if you ask. Prices are reasonable. Their microchipping service is relatively cheap compared to other places too... so if you already own an animal who keeps losing his or her collar, you can bring them here to get chipped.   This will always be my first stop when I'm looking to adopt in the future!

Tonight, my dad was craving a meatball sandwich. Instead of just going up to Subway on the corner... we decided to be adventurous and try some place new. Jimmy's came up on a Google search of "Mesa AZ meatball sandwich", and after looking over their menu online we decided to make the trek down there.  SO glad we did. I ordered a Chicken Parmigiana sandwich. Super yummy. Also super messy and moderately difficult to eat (the way a sandwich should be!). Dad ordered the Homemade Meatball sandwich with the "spicy" sauce. I stole a nibble of one of the meatballs... REALLY tasty, but I didn't find their spicy sauce to be terribly spicy (not that I mind, since I'm not good with anything that's too spicy).   On the way out, we ordered the Baked Mostaccioli for my mom at home... I didn't steal a taste, but it looked and smelled delicious.  I look forward to coming back to Jimmy's... I hope their pizza and pasta is just as tasty as the sandwich I had. :)

It took me a while to warm up to this place. My friend kept dragging me here because she loves the gyros. I'm the kind of person where I find one thing on the menu that I absolutely adore... and then I order it every time I go back... and often find myself craving it at random hours of the night.  Well last week I found that one item on the menu that is going to make me keep coming back here.   I definitely suggest this place for more cautious eaters (like me) that maybe aren't so sure about Greek food... since they also have American selections... and you can slowly ease into the Greek side of things.

Went here with my boyfriend (Nam D.... who will probably write a review after I post this) this afternoon. He was sooo excited to have Cuban food again, because he hasn't really had any since he left Tuscon to move here 6 years ago.   But just... wow. No. I ordered the Masitas de Peurco, which according to the menu took 30 minutes to prepare. Great, I thought, more time to play Boggle while we waited! I'm not entirely sure what they did to the pork that took half an hour, but by the time it came to the table it was hardly recognizable. It was waaaaaay overcooked and a little bit on the salty side. When I went to squeeze some lime juice on it (it came with 2 slices of lime)... nothing came out of the limes. I forced about half of my pork down before Nam & I left. Took the rest of my food home with me to be polite.   Maybe I can use the leftover pork as a doorstop or something...   Definitely not planning on coming back any time in the immediate future.

My husband & I started taking our cars here a year or so ago when we moved nearby. Initially we came here because of proximity, but we have gotten such phenomenal (honest, NO pressure) service here that now I won't go anywhere else - even if we move again. Customer for life.

The only reason I stopped by this IHOP was because my mom was craving pancakes after her doctor's appointment. Usually, I'm not a big IHOP person.  I ordered the Bacon 'N Beef Bacon Cheeseburger because the thought of bacon IN the hamburger patty made squeal with glee. But when it arrived, I couldn't taste the bacon in the patty at all. Perhaps it was the fact the bacon on top overpowered the bacon in the patty... but it wasn't all I hoped. The fries were decent.  Mom seemed happy with her pancakes and eggs. So I suppose it wasn't a total bust.  I feel the need to add that we had the most amazing waitress here, though. Really. She was a lot of fun and ended up hovering over our table to play a quick game of key chain Boggle. :)  But yeah... IHOP isn't my favourite place to eat.

I  am sad this place has so many low star reviews. I work behind the shopping center just east of Dickey's, so my boyfriend & I come here often for lunch... to the point where I'm pretty sure the entire staff recognizes and remembers us. It's my favourite lunch option in the immediate area that gets me back to work within my allotted 30 minutes.   I am completely addicted to their Spicy Cheddar Sausage, and the Pulled Pork is also quite delicious. So I tend to stick to their 1 or 2 meat plates. They offer 3 different kinds of BBQ sauce - I always opt for Original, but they also have a Spicy and a Sweet. They offer complimentary pickles AND soft serve ice cream. I don't recommend putting those two things together, but free is always good!   Boyfriend & I have always experienced top notch service here, but we pretty much always come after their lunch rush. Staff has never been anything less than helpful and friendly. We get greeted, they offer to take our empty baskets, and we get thanked when we leave. :)

Just ordered lunch to go here, took it home and deliciousness happened!  The gyro was really good, the quorma sabzi was unique and super tasty, baklava was only thing that was ordinary.  Great place!

Coming out of review hibernation to sing the praises of Zappone's. Fiance & I have been here at least 6 times in the past handful of months... I've ordered a variety of things off their menu and have NEVER been disappointed. And I'm a little picky about my Italian food.   None of their sauces are too sweet (I have a major beef with sugared down sauce)... lasagna, ravioli, gnocchi, tortelloni... all amazing!  And for those cannoli purists out there, yes, their cannoli are made with ricotta and not cream. I know that was a big selling point for my mom. ;)  To those older reviews who complained about having to pre-pay & pre-tip, this is no longer a thing at Zappone's.  Servers are super friendly and amazing. I always enjoy my visits here.

I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I mean, even if it's fast food... it's a place that specializes in chicken fingers. That's pretty much all they do. So they have to have the most amazing, flavourful chicken fingers ever, right?   Nope. I mean, they weren't the most awful chicken fingers I've ever eaten - there was some moisture there - but they were bland. So disappointingly bland. The dipping sauce (thousand island dressing?) helped a little, but I won't be hopping back in my car to buy more. Popeyes is further away, but much tastier.

Went here a little after they opened yesterday with the hubby. Was a little nervous with all the less-than-great reviews about service, but our service was great. The menu says they have Diet Dr. Pepper, but they didn't when I asked (not a major deal breaker for me, regular DP is fine) and I'd definitely avoid the Chipotle Mashed Potatoes next time (they were oddly bland?). But the Arizona burrito I had was super delicious and hubby seemed to enjoy all his tacos. So thumbs up. Would come back.
