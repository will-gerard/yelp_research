I have been a customer at Seville Cleaners for almost a year now and consistently use this store for my family's dry cleaning services.  I work in downtown phoenix, live in Tempe and drive to Scottsdale because I like the services I've received at Seville.  I've never had a problem with the business until yesterday.     I was scrutinized and belittled by two of the employees when I tried to use my Belly app points. They questioned me on how many points I accumulated when it was apparent on my phone.  The points I accumulated equated to $1.50 off, really not a big deal compared to how much I've spent at this business over the past year on dry cleaning.  The employees were also terse and quite unfriendly when I picked up my items. On top of this, when I returned home and checked my clothes, they were not pressed properly and the work seemed incomplete so I now have steam them myself.    This one experience with these employees has certainly left a bad taste in my mouth.  As a customer, I have multiple dry cleaners to choose from yet I chose this business.  I felt humiliated that these employees scrutinized me over a points system and didn't seem to take care with my clothing.  I don't understand why a business would affiliate with the app if you don't want to honor it.  Needless to say, you've lost a loyal customer, I'll take my business elsewhere.

I tried Lucille's food for the first time at the Scottsdale culinary festival and was quite impressed with the food. A year or so later, I visited the restaurant at Tempe Marketplace and was not impressed. I waited almost 20 minutes to place an order then waited another 25-30 minutes for the food. I understand restaurants get busy but that's ridiculous. When I returned home, I found that my order was incomplete, I definitely was not driving back to the restaurant.  I ordered the sliders which seemed a bit dry with not much taste. The cornbread and biscuits were okay but that's pretty much it. Considering the cost, the amount of time it took to order and obtain my food and the quality of the food, I will be exploring other restaurants for BBQ.

Very poor customer service, I would give no stars if possible. I regularly shop at Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack and I've NEVER had an experience like I did at this store. The staff act like customers don't exist. Never again will I visit this store.

I found this company on Living Social and bought one of their deals, I contacted the number listed on the voucher and received a text back indicating that they were in a meeting and I should send my address for their availability...ummm absolutely I was not going to send my address to some random individual, whom I had never spoken to, over text! I replied indicating that I would like to speak to someone. A man called me back and I verified that this was the Living Social Deal. He then gave me the availability for the following week so I set an appointment.  The day before my appointment I get a text informing me that they have to cancel and they let me know that they can show up at my house that day. I inform them that this is not possible and ask what other appointments are available, the man stated that he will have to get back to me.  The day of my appointment comes and goes and there has still been no follow up from this company.  My advice beware, stay away. This company is unprofessional and lacks understanding of basic customer service.

I cannot say enough great things about A Bake Shop and Andrea. They make amazing desserts. I've used them for my bridal shower, wedding, baby shower and a birthday and they've always delivered exquisite results. Their attention to detail is beyond perfect! I look forward to ordering for more events!
