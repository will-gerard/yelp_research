Love this sports bar! Always will be my go-to spot to catch a game, drink a cold beer, and eat some wings....amazing! Usually sit in the bar area and the bartenders are great!

I usually come here for the burgers of course and the chicken stir fry dish.   First off the service was just meh. Didn't seem like he cared about us being there. The food took forever to come out. After 25 minutes, we asked the status on our food. He went to go check on it, all the while we could see him on the line checking expo tickets and stuffing his face with French fries at the same time. Must be nice to eat, we were starving!  For being well known and voted #1 for their burgers, you think they would know how to prepare med rare. Burger came out to be med well. Chicken stir fry was awesome, as always.   We overheard the bartender apologizing to the couple next to us about the food taking a long time to come out. He offered them free dessert. Ummmm hello, where was our free dessert offer for our long wait??! Very disappointing.   I might come back for the chicken stir fry. But probably only to go. Service has been consistently bad.

Sooooo good. The bartender was so friendly and knowledgeable about different bourbons and liqours and really any craft cocktail you can imagine. Also, hands down the best chopped salad anywhere. The brussel sprouts. The ramen. Pretty much the entire menu. If you're ever looking for amazing drinks or food, this is the place.

Cozy, vintage, and amazing. There are 30,000 pennies in the bar top. Bartender is very friendly and knowledgeable about different wines. Wine pours come in beakers!!!
