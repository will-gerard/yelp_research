Love the zoo.  We had a season pass and went whenever the weather was good (not too hot)  The best part of the zoo, in my opinion, is the squirrel monkey exhibit.  You get to walk thru with all the little cuties hanging around.  We managed to go last when they had their little babies on their backs, too cute.  We also like when they have the stingray exhibit, check for schedule, my daugther spends tons of time touching them.  It does cost extra for this exhibit but if you have kids it is worth it.  We did try a 2 person bike rental to view the zoo.  My suggestion is to have 2 adults peddling.  My child was not able to help much and my legs hurt and on some of the hills I had to push it.  If you are lucky enough, usually earlier in the day, you will find the handlers taking care of and feeding the animals.  They are very happy to answer questions and tell interesting stories about their charges.  We also like to go early because all the animals are usually up and about.  The little critters (chipmunks?) are still out searching for food and are fun too watch as well.

Unlike my sis, Sarah M., who doesn't like greek food,  I love greek food and this place did not disappoint.  Not only was the food great but it felt like we were invited to a family party rather than eating at a restaurant.  Loved the music and the dancing and how everyone was included.  My 11 year old was invited to dance more than once and she had a great time.  I highly recommend going for a late dinner and staying for the entertainment.  Be willing to join in and you will have a blast!

My daughter and I frequent this place.  I am addicted to their veggie burrito and E is addicted to their cheese crisp.  It really is fresh and simple meixcan food.  I also like their chips and salsa.  Good price, good food, good service...this is what keeps us going back

2 stars because I really did like the eye doctor I saw, she was awsome.    Thought I was off to a good start getting new glasses.  I picked out my frames while I waited to be taken care of.    Oh...wait...the eye glass gods had something else in store for me.    The person helping me couldn't get an authorization code from my insurance company because it was afterhours.  He actually told me I had to pay full price or come back tomorrow.  Now keep in mind that I have had this insurance forever, never had any problems before; after hours, weekends, etc.  So I used my cell and called the insurance company.  I get someone on the phone who is trying to help us.  I put eyemaster guy on the phone and he actually got into a fight with the woman on the phone, handed it back to me and said here you talk to her, I'm done.    So the lady got me the authorization code and a explaination that this doesn't happen because most eye glass providers can take care of everything in spite of the insurance company being closed and she also asked me if I was sure I shouldn't switch eyemaster locations due to this guys behavior.    But I thought I was done.  I have my glasses picked out and I needed them to drive.  So while she was talking to me the guy at eyemasters was throwing out insults loud enough that the lady could hear.    So I lost 1/2 hour of my time and think the worst is over  Well...those darn eye glass gods...I can't get them in an hour because it was too late in the day the guy tells me.  He has the right lens and it was only 6:00 pm,  come back tomorrow.    So I called today and was told 1/2 hour and they will be ready.  I drive over there on my lunch hour and guess what.  They aren't even close to being ready.  So I walk around the mall, come back and guess what, only 1 pair is ready.  That would normally be ok but the attitude of the two guys working is arrogant and not very customer friendly.  I laugh it off and leave.    So what are the odds I'll get my glasses after work today???  One can only wonder.  Awful service, unprofessional and unpleasant to experience.

Saw Avitar on Christmas day.  Awsome movie, visually stunning.  The theater is very nice.  They announced that they are now a part of Harkins theaters, interesting that they actually announced this, kinda nice to know.  They were sold out and people were trying to buy our tickets while my sister waited in the lobby.  I'm glad we went, comfortable seats, clean theater and awsome 3d experience.  Oh, but the glasses were too big for my face, only complaint.

Christmas Brunch...awsome! We went here after doing the family at home meal on Christmas Eve. It wasn't very busy which made it even better. The crepes were a huge hit at our table. I had prime rib, a custom omelet, salad with raspberries and walnuts, seafood, etc etc etc. Yes, I was stuffed after I ate as were the rest of my family. But it was so good, you hate to leave a brunch when there is good food right there. I would go back for the holiday brunch anytime. The staff was also very attentive and efficient.

My daughter and I went this Monday on Martin Luther King day.  We had an appointment set for 1:30.  The wait was long.  We sat there for a good hour.  We watched as the doctors did all the contact lense fittings before they took the eye exams.  This wait aside, I really did like Dr. Patel.  He was very friendly and explained everything to us in detail.  We will definitley go back to see him in the future.  We went to get glasses next and this wasn't too bad either.  We where waited on right away.  We had a newer associate help us and she asked for help from her coworkers as needed.  She was very friendly and the overall experience was good.

I've now gone here a couple of times and will be returning.  It's nice to find such good sushi at my end of town.  I always leave here stuffed because I can't stop from eating everything we order.  Even their entree's that are cooked are great.  Excellent service and excellent food.

I'm on a Outback kick.  I can't help it.  We ended up here one evening by chance and I love their steak and loaded mashed potato.  The service is good, the food is good, it's not too crowded.  Like I say, I'm on a kick.

I volunteer here every Friday for Halo, no kill animal shelter, and enjoy being amongst fellow animal lovers.  The staff is super friendly and I do a lot of shopping here for treats for the dogs.  I love seeing all the customers with their little doggies.  Their prices are actually pretty good, I look for sales and that's usually what I buy.  They could keep the place a bit tidier(sp)  but otherwise a nice Petsmart location.  If you come in Friday evening and see a mom and daughter taking care of the kittens, say hi!

My child bowls here on a league.  We like it.  Yeah bowling alleys aren't known as good places to eat so who cares that it tastes like "school lunch"  They keep the alley clean and in good working condition.  It's a good sport for my child, keeps her busy and teaches her how to be a part of a team.  All good stuff.  They run the league really well, and my child has been doing this for 3 years now and, seriously, this is the longest she has gone without getting bored with something she chose to be involved in.  This is the main reason why I like this bowling alley.

After my trip to Hawaii I was craving fish.  My mom and I decided to go to Red Lobster, haven't been to one in forever.  It was dinner time and the place was busy.    Yes, they still have the awsome biscuits and their food is good.  But here is the reason for this review.  They are doing something right at the Metro Center location, we had the best service ever.    The waiter was prompt and even indicated that anyone in the area can help if he isn't there right when we need him.  He refilled our drinks, was very attentive and professional.  The manager came over to see how are meal was and actually asked in a way that made it clear she cared (sounds kinda sappy, but usually when managers ask at other places it doesn't ring sincere a lot of time)  She even took some of our plates away with her.    Very impressed with the service.  Good job Metro Center Red Lobster!

Yesterday was the first time I've ever been to Mimi's and it was pretty good,  I got chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was yummy, especially the chicken.  Not too fancy but a nice place to sit and have a pretty good meal.  Good service and reasonable prices.

We went to the museum on a Sunday.  They are only open from  1-5 pm on Sundays but it worked well for us.  We had fun, great outing for kids and adults.  We loved going from room to room to see what the museum would offer next.  My daughter had the most fun panning for fools gold and in the dinosaur rooms.  The gift store was right up my childs alley, lots of rocks and geods to choose from.  We had fun which is what museums sometimes should be about.  Only negative was some of the exhibits could use a little updating, some light bulbs were out, minor things really.  Oh, was Elvis the alligator real or fake?  We stared at it for awhile and couldn't tell.

My daughter and I stopped in on a Saturday.  We happened to be at Pratt's Feed which is right down the road and decided to stop on our way out of Glendale.  There was a line but it went really fast.  We ended up getting pan dulce, doughnuts, cookies and freshly made tortillas.  We watched the tortillas come off the tortilla maker and get bagged for us.  My child ate several plain tortillas on the way home.  This was the best part of our purchase, warm tortillas are the best.  The cookies and other sweets were good, I always like Mexican bakery food because it isn't so sweet you get grossed out.  They were just right.  The price was excellent, could never have bought so much at a regular bakery.  Will go back again.  F.Y.I.  I believe they may only take cash and this is a local neighborhood bakery that looks like it's been there forever, don't expect flashy decor.

I thoroughly enjoyed everything.  Cute little place, pleasant service, yummy Polish food.  I will be returning.  Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that one of my two lunch partners thought the food was too bland.  I would argue that he expects everything to be overly spicy and therefore doesn't appreciate anthing else.  But...since he wasn't as impressed I decided to achnowledge his opinion.  They took our lunch reservation and had a table held for us which was awsome.  It is a tiny place so I would recommend reservations so you won't have to wait.

I bought a new chair here yesterday.  It was delivered yesterday evening, I got a good discount and the sales guy, Curtis, was easy to deal with.  Now... they are having a problem right now.  They blew some power thingy and have no power inside the Shed.  They will have it fixed soon but it made for an interesting shopping experience.  But I can overlook this because to have something delivered the same day and on my schedule is super awsome.  Hardly ever happens this way and I appreciated it.  And my new chair is an Ashley reclyner and is super comfy.  I love it.

I just love this place.  So much to choose from, everything I have tried has been just really tasty.  I recommend the drive to pick up some yummy treats.  I usually get a box of goodies and put it in my fridge so we can just grab something out of it and that way it lasts longer.

We ended up here for our book club.  Not too shaby.  We were going to be at the greek place across the street but they ended up being closed on Sundays.  Friendly service, yummy pizza and good tossed salad because of their house dressing.  Overall, nice little pizza place.

Yummy!  We went here for New Years Eve and had some really good food.  Service was awsome.  We ordered the asparagus and cheese dip, good stuff.  We even got more chips delivered to our table without asking.  I got the Ahi tuna salad and the carrots.  I also got to try the salmon, green beans, french fries and grilled chicken by stealing off everyones plates.  All was good and everyone ate way too much.  We decided to share a brownie for desert...warm and sweet and I want another one now that I'm thinking about it.  The only sort of down side was how dark they keep the place but I do understand the concept, there is a light shining down on each table and this does keep your focus on the food and each other.  The staff is all dressed in black and sort of blend into the dark setting.  Kinda like ninja waiters, they show up and then disappear.  Very reasonable prices were a plus.  I want to go back an try other things on their menu, very good meal.

I don't know if I just went on an off night for the staff ...  Good thing I have a sense of humor.  I decided to keep my order simple, a fried been and cheese burrito.  For some reason they could not get it right and had to start over.  They were all running around behing the counter, everyone had to keep repeating their order as we moved down the line.  They also kept throwing red sauce on top of my burrito when I didn't ask for any.  I gave up and just had to laugh.  I won't be going back anytime soon.  Their trash was overflowing, we had a long wait in line (and it wasn't that busy) plus I didn't think their tortilla chips were good.  If the chips aren't good, I don't go back.

Pretty spot in the desert.  I think as far as urban renewel goes, they did a good job.  It's nice to walk around and watch the boaters.  At night it is very pretty.  Plenty of seating on the South side, we were able to relax and enjoy some out door time looking at water instead of desert.  They have some fun events here and it's a good place to take the family.

I was just reminded that I need to write a review of the market I've been finding myself at lately.  Yes, it is right around the corner from where I live and yes, I've been ignoring it for years.  But now I've come to my senses and frequent this store.  Lots of fruit and veggies, bulk items, healthy food.  I can't believe they have the exact veggie snacks that I loved when Trader Joes used to carry them.  (note, this is what I don't like about Trader Joes, they have something I love and then they stop carrying it)  I like the prices at this store too, I am becoming thrifty in my sorta old age.  I will continue to shop here and enjoy my finds.  Friendly people work here too, also a plus.  Enjoy!

No need to discuss the menu, we all have our favorite...such as a carmel frapp for me.  But I have to mention the service at this location.  Normally, I frequent the drive-thru.  They have never given me an incorrect order and they are super friendly.  Inside is very well maintained and the seating outside is nice.  I love my local starbucks!

My new favorite toy is my new laptop.  I bought it at Best Buy because they had a good deal on it.  But what I was pleasantly surprised about was the customer service I received back in computers.  Darn if I can't recall his name but the guy who helped me was really...well... helpful.  The store is well taken care of and the service was great.  I know, I know, Fry's might have lower prices at times but every time I go there I don't have a pleasant experience.  I even checked to see what they had prior to Best Buy and found the deal at Best Buy to be better.   Overall very good experience and I will probably shop here again just for the pleasant experience.

Good chips and salsa.  I usually order a burrito and taco combo.  I love the shredded meat in both.  I hate when you get chewy pieces at some resteraunts but they never seem to have this problem.  Rice and beans are also good.  For a "fast food" place they have really good food.  Good prices too, I always have leftovers for lunch the next day which is just an added bonus.  I think I might hit their drive-thru on the way home tonight...yum!

I can't believe I haven't tried their food sooner, it was so good.  Ok, I can't spell it but the baba ganush was to die for.  Just a little bit of a bite to it, perfect.  The gyro plate was loaded to the brim with lamb and rice and was really good.  I had plenty of leftovers to take home and eat the next day.

I've had way better and for less money.  Seriously over-rated.  Plus could the parking and store be any smaller.  The cupcakes look pretty but as my daugther put it, it wasn't as good as it looked.  I would buy a grocery store cupcake over these any day.

I love this place.  I bought 3 chickens here; Baby Girl, Caramel and AnnaBelle.  Happy, healthy and living in a full size chicken coop in my backyard (ps, don't tell the city)  I actually got one of the guys over at Pratt's to build me the coop and deliver it for an insanely low price.  E and I go there on weekends just to wander around and play with the baby chicks, the bunnies, the pigs, the puppies, whatever they have at the time.  It's like a mini farm in the downtown Glendale area...I love it!

Needs better decor, something to help create some ambiance.  Looks like all the other generic restaurants that have gone into abandoned fast food buildings only this one is sprinkled with kitschy Chinese items.  But the food was good.  Like others have said, you need to ask for the dim sum menu.  The staff was very helpful in making suggestions as to what we should try, maybe a little too helpful, but that's ok.  Was pleasantly surprised by the bill, less than we usually spend when going out to eat

Maybe it was because I was starving... I liked the food.  We were at the Pointe for a trade show and this is where we ended up for lunch.  We had no wait and the food was really good, I got a shredded beef cheese crisp and my coworker got the chimi plate.  The chips and salsa were good.  Only issue I had was my empty ice tea glass, I finally had to ask for more when our bill was delivered.

This place or Sprinkles?  Hmmm...neither.  They looked better than they tasted was the theme once again.  I love sweets but really am becoming sour on the cupcakes available.  Again, grocery store cupcakes would have been better.  We tried the Red Velvet, Lemon, and Cherrie.  They left us less than impressed.  The cookies we tried, at a hefty $6.50 for a small bag, were just ok.  Oh well, maybe the next cupcake place to open will wow us.

I love the tableside guacamole and would go there just to eat it even though the price is a bit much for it.  I've been there a couple of times and both times my food was very good.  I also like the atmosphere, it has a upscale but yet comfortable vibe.  The milkshake with churros we had at the end were oh so yummy!

We went on a Satuday night, busy but not too bad.  Good service and really good food.  They even catered to my picky childs request, sauce on the side and no cheese.  Until recently I wasn't a fan of Olive Garden and couldn't understand why it was so busy.  Years ago I had tried it and wasn't impressed.  Decided to give it a chance and have now gone twice in the last month.  Breadsticks and salad and then some good pasta, can't complain about that.  Plus the reasonable prices put it back on my list of places to go.

Stop here if you need a snack or if you are planning an event.  I stopped off for a snack and was happily surprised.  I tried the butter pecan and garlic and herb popcorn, yum!  They are very friendly and their popcorn is good.  I already plan on using their popcorn for upcoming parties.  Great little place.

I agree with some of the other reviewers, it is a lot like Subway.  But I am partial to pita bread and subway so it was all good.  We sat outside and ate while listening to a musician who happened to be playing in the courtyard.  I would suggest not getting the meal combo which included chips, we did, and could not eat the chips because the pita was filling enough on it's own.   We will be going back.

Ah-So was just sort of so-so.  Sushi, could have been better.  Service really needs help.  It shouldn't take so much time to get our bill so we could escape.  I might give it another chance down the road, but we spent a lot of money for lunch and just walked away kinda annoyed.   I was a little turned off by the decor but could overlook this if the food really wowed me.

We went to Central Grille on Thanksgiving for their buffet.  Good food, excellent service and very nice ambiance.  We asked to sit outside and the weather was great for it.  Great place to sit back, relax and enjoy some food.  While I didn't drink they had a pretty good wine and beer list.  I will go back, enjoyed the experience.

Was shopping with my mom and we decided we deserved a treat, what with all our hard shopping.  It was good.  I got the plain tart yogurt ice cream and put berries and yogurt chips on top.  Really good.  It wasn't crowded but it was an off time, around 2 in the afternoon.  I enjoyed it.  My mom enjoyed it as well, although I couldn't see her ice cream because as usual she covered it completely with sprinkles.  Cute place and refreshing treat.

Yummy.  I got a crepe with mushroom and swiss cheese, soooo good.  Shared an order of sweet potato fries, only thing missing was a delicious sauce to dip them in.  I like that they have the screen up where you can watch the crepes being made for you.  They have a small stage for evening performances.  They were having a comedian that night according to the host.  Good service along with good food, can't ask for much more than that.  I will be going back to try the fondue and different crepes.

Yum, I am in love with the green tea with condensed milk and mochi balls.  My daughter with the original with chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch (not on the menu).  It is light and refreshing and cools you off on these incredibly hot phoenix days.  I plan on trying one of their teas, eventually, but for now I am content with the shaved ice.  Unique and tasty option in place of ice cream or frozen yogurt.

I am writing a biased review...I volunteer for Halo and I obviously support them and think they are great or I wouldn't help them out.  What I wanted to tell everyone about is how great they are with not only animals but people too.  I was on a mission about a year ago to find a volunteer project for my daugther and myself to do together.  She was only 10 at the time.  I could not find anything for someone her age other than 1 day community projects.  Then I followed a natural course and asked myself the following questions.  What we both had interest in?  ...animals.  Which animal did E like best?   ...cats.  I checked around and found Halo.  And, yes, they had a job for children her age.   I liked that they are a no kill/second chance shelter for animals that are out of time at the local pound.  Thus, we became kitty cuddlers at our local Petsmart.  We enjoy taking care of our cats every Friday and it is something we can be proud of.  Excellent orginization!  Side note, turned out I had adopted by 1st dog from them years ago.

This sushi place is close to my home and I've been wanting to try it and finally did.  I was surprised at how good it was.  We had an excellent meal with cucumber salads and several of the sushi offerings off of their happy hour menu and some green iced tea.  All was fresh and tasty.   We had excellent service and will be returning.

I love the Red Velvet cake from Nothing Bundt Cakes.  I'm hoping to have it again for my birthday.  They are a bit pricey but soooo sweet and yummy.  They also do a great job with presentation.  I just wish they were located in central phx.
