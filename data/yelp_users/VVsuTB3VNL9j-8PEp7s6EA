Havent been here in a while, so I decided to come back to actually try out the food this time. I used to come here to drink and meet up with friends. I was in the mood for a steak so I ordered the ribeye the food came out in a timely manner and the service was good . Sad to say the steak was not as good as the service . I'm a better stick myself and that is what I compared to. I felt like I ordered from a one star restaurant. I literally wanted to bring in my own cow and show them how to really make some good steak . I guess next time I'll stay in and cook my own.

Never been here before although I've known of it for years. Today my biz partner and I will try the Blazin Wings which are supposed to be hotter than the devil with chlamydia. We will see. I will report soon.  Ok I'm back. The Blazin wings were good but not hot enough for me. The mango habanero was delicious. Desert heat a close 2nd.  I have came, I have conquered. Respect my gangsta.

Odele muthafuckas...this is hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants I know of. Gives me one more reason to thank the Mexican culture. I generally order the carne asada burrito,beans,guacamole,sour cream,pico de gallo and a lil Mexicana love. And you know what I love about a lot of Mecican restaurants...they post pictures of the actual food. Compadres, this is muy bueno.

I cannot lie, I was exited to come here and I had high expectations. I seen this place on Man Vs Food and have been wanting that Torta ever since. I must say, I'm not impressed. I'm from Los Angeles Ca., the land where some of the best and most authentic food come from. So I always have higher expectations when it comes to Mexican food. This  was def not mi amor. I would say this isn't MexiCAN food but more like MexiCANT. No bueno

I've come  to notice that the places with the best god are the little hole in the wall spots. My biz partner and I lucked up when we yelped this place to eat before we hit the road for a 6 hr trip. As soon as we walked in a older, heavy set African American man was sitting behind the counter. He appeared to be chewing something in his mouth and had that cliche southern style look. I loved it, we ordered the catfish and cod with fried shrimp on side. I must say they were delicious. Good service with good food always speaks volumes in my book.  I'm not sure if the fried fish cooked by African American people was so good because they're great cold or because I'm biased because it's Black history month. Never the less, two thumbs up.

Great crowd, diversity and I'm not talking about the boat.  Ordered a Corona with grenadine n the whores flocked. I'm starting to like Phoenix .   On so apparently don't be black in here tho. I got kicked out for literally nothing, it's crazy. They claimed I spilled someone's drink, I even offered to buy the person another drunk but they weren't going for it. Go figure right. Fuck this bar .

This place is shitballs. They had no baskets so we had to carry our food around the store. We stood in the customer service line forever because it had the liquor, when we asked a store employee Keyanna could she please grab the Hennessy for us, because she was literally 2ft away she said ask the lady at the register. This Walmart sucks

Great customer service. We walk in and it's this little guy with glasses smoking a cigar, classic. He recommended a blueberry and vanilla cigar. Greatness is about to occur

Forget any buffet you've ever been to, it doesn't matter what you may think you know. This is thee best buffet EVER. 5 star buffet, from lobster clam chowder to macaroni n cheese to die for. If there was ever evidence for a god, this would be it.

So as you know I'm an avid sushi lover. Nothing says hiiiyah origato like sushi and sake bombs. It was fairly crowded as we walked on and they had no seats even tho they let us sit at the bar or the community table, we chose the bar. Let me tell you the seafood dynamite roll is fucking amazing. It was like every beautiful Japanese a geisha girl sat on  my tongue.  We them ordered the sake bombs and let me tell ya, it was like Hiroshima and Nagasaki in my mouth. I love this place.

Very rarely do I give out 5 stars. Today is that day. I already have a favorite sandwich place that I eat at in Vegas and none has topped it in the many years that I have frequented that place. Today is the day that the crown is placed on another. There were so many different delicious sounding sandwiches to choose from that I kept ordering then changing my mind  and choosing a different one. I wish I had 5 extra stomaches. I finally decided to order the Adam Richman sandwich because we follow him on Man Vs Food. Let me tell you , the moment I but into it, rockets flared, music played and a beautiful butterfly metamorphosized. It was like I was eating the equivalent of Beyonc√© mixed with Angelina Jolie's "talents". Today the food gods  shined upon me and I smiled back as I took another bite into what life is about....ECSTASY
