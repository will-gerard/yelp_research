If you like over priced food that is sub par, over priced draft beer that is sometimes cold, and service that you could get better at mcdonalds,, this is the place for you!. waitresses are not bad looking but some of them look like they came straight off the streets.

Typical Aloft - quick check in clean rooms, friendly staff, friendly bartender, over priced drinks, and typical Aloft food (which I  never get). beds were comfy, wake up call was on-time, internet fast and close to airport. under $130 a night.

Ok..I think this is the one by the aloft hotel.... I usually don't eat at chains..but it was getting late and didn't want to drive.. I ate at ruby Tuesday several time s....but this one had to be the worst one in the us... the salad bar was a bit bare and un appetizing looking...thousand island dressing looked just foul..and it was room temp... ordered the ribeye (most expensive thing on the menu) it was disgusting!! I ate 1/2 of it because I was hungry...big mistake 3 am I violated the commode in the hotel room... room 301 off housekeeping reads this my apologies
