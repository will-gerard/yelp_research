Why is this the best? Simple. It advertises 5 dollar wash and that's it. I see lots of washes that say 3 or 4 bucks ...BUT when you pull in you get harassed into a membership or wax or telling you to fix some small chip in the windshield! None of that here. You decide what you want at the kiosk and nobody busts your chops for more. Plus free vacuum.

Great martinis on happy hour!! Great atmosphere and food. I got the filet tips which are a type of appetizer. Bartender was friendly and great area in general.

I don't get how a restaurant thinks its patrons want to come in at 10 am for breakfast and want to hear music blaring!! Way too loud for breakfast!! Im not going to a club. I walk in and there is a giant speaker pointed right at the tables. Does anyone actually enjoy this? I don't care how great the food is. Bad, obnoxious atmosphere for that time of day at a family establishment.

Hey not too bad. Good size place with very personal service. Got a charred dog and side of meatballs. Simple lunch but did like it:) Nice mom n pop type quality.
