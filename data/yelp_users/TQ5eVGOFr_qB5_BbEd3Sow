I liked the old airport better.  I hate large, hard to navigate, walk forever to get to your gate airports.  My parents and I once didn't find each other till an hour after I landed because it was so big and confusing.  My parents always hated that there was ALWAYS construction going on there and it kept changing so you could never be sure the route you took one time would work the next time you went.  It was almost easier to just drive there from San Diego than to fly.

I wasn't that impressed.  The machines look old and rusted, there didn't seem to be any air-conditioning and it had to be in the 90's inside since it was about 110 outside.  They did have overhead fans.  The price was cheap--45 cents per load to wash in a top loader but we only found one top-loader available that actually worked.  Half of them were Out Of Order.  Instead we dumped everything into two front loaders that claimed to do double loads and were out of there in pretty short order.  We took the clothes back to my daughter's apartment building to dry in the laundry room there so she didn't have to stay with them.

I'm gonna up the stars.  It's cheap, they keep it clean, sitting in it for a couple of hours was not too bad, except it is hotter than Hades.  Even the kids are pretty well behaved.  There's a movie on the tv and fans going.    Bring a cold drink and tough it out.

My daughter and I, plus my two year old grandson, came here for dinner tonight.  We were across the street at the Goodwill after picking him up at his children's center and scrapped our plan to go to Arizona Mills because it was getting late and came here instead.  I recognized the place when we walked in and remembered coming here several years ago with my mother and husband and had good food.  Tonight was no disappointment.    The owners couldn't have been more patient regarding our tired, noisy toddler, and to them I apologize.  Our food was excellent, flavorful and not overly salty as some teriyaki can be.  The salad and soup were especially enjoyable.  I'm not a big eggroll fan but theirs were really good and the crab puff was one of the best I'd ever eaten.  I look forward to  coming back here, hopefully this trip but definitely anytime I'm in town, and perhaps without the tired child next time so I can relax and enjoy a little more and not chase away other customers.

It's fast food but their price on the small malt makes me come back.  When you don't want or need something huge and too calorie laden, the small malt fills the bill at $2.39. The employees are always very nice, too.  I've had the Chicken tenders and the burger, both were okay but not wonderful, to-die-for, can't-wait to-come-back good.  Just okay.  But they weren't bad either.  But their malts are delicious without breaking the bank.  Now excuse me while I go deal with my brain freeze.

This place was very good for the excellent price.  I especially loved the beef noodle soup which had a dark rich broth and lots of noodles and meat. I was in a soup mood on this chilly evening and I had three small bowls of it.  The chicken with star noodles was also good.  I had two bowls of it.  I only had a taste of the potato-leek and was too full to appreciate it.    The salads were fresh and tasty but I was running out of room so I couldn't finish them.  There was only one piece of pizza left, which I ate.  It had good flavor, though was more like frozen pizza than pizza parlor type. The Caesar salad was gone when we first went thru so I didn't taste it.  My daughter went back for some and liked it.   She said the ice cream was real good at the end.  I only had room for a tiny piece of sweet honeydew melon and small portion of strawberries, both good.    The dinner was $5.79 for me and $6.79 for her and we both felt like it was a bargain.  While it was buffet, the girl walking around kept checking with all the customers see if they needed anything.    There wasn't anybody at the cash register when we walked in even tho we waited a couple of minutes so we went ahead and went thru the line.  I'm sure we could have left without paying as nobody seemed to realize we hadn't paid, except that's not my style, so we tracked somebody down to pay when we were finished.   They had already closed out the cash registers since it was closing time and couldn't take my credit card so I paid cash and received a handwritten receipt.  But the manager and helper we chatted with at the end were so nice it balanced off the negative.  Oh, and I especially looked carefully at the trays and dishes after reading an earlier review but everything was very clean.  So was the table we sat at, though we did change tables as the first booth we sat at was very small and left us no "growing room."  The other booth was spacious and fine.  Next time I'm in a soup mood, this is my place to go!

Easy carwash, fast and not expensive for the budget wash, tho more than it was my last trip here in 2010.  It runs $5 now, was $4 then.   It gets the AZ dust and bird poop off which is all I need.  They are open 9~6, closed Sundays.  Located on the west side of Fiesta Mall.

I wandered in here to check it out from curiosity and was quite amazed at their huge selection of T-shirts and posters from every imaginable rock group and concert.  It's really one of those places you have to see to believe.  They have a website too, www.shirtsandposters.com.  Check it out.

This is the closest Goodwill to my daughter's so I have shopped in here several times, usually with good success.  When she had her baby early I came in here and was happy to find several cute preemie items and baby blankets and sheets for my new grandson.  Everything on the racks was immaculately clean and unstained.  She loved what I bought.  I've been back a couple of times and always find cute clean things.  I'm due to go there again for the next size up as he keeps growing!    I've also found some good deals on yarn for the hand knitted preemie hats I make to donate, tho sometimes their prices are almost as much as new yarn at Michaels.

If it was up to this place I'd still be sitting in my motel room waiting for a car to arrive to pick me up and bring me over there!  When I got to town I looked online for a rental car because I had taken the train here. I decided to go with Enterprise.  This was the office that my daughter recommended because she had used them in the past so I entered this location as my choice  The website said that they had free pick up and drop off so I called them up and asked for a ride over there, which is only about a mile north. They said they would have to call me back when someone was going to head over.  I had an appointment an hour and a half later which was plenty of time.    I NEVER heard back from them. I finally called another location about a mile south of me, explained the situation which at this point I only had maybe half an hour to get to my appointment. The location on Baseline was very understanding and very efficient. They sent someone over within 15 minutes, zooming me down to the office, had me fill out the paperwork quickly and I was on my way in a Dodge Avenger to my appointment which fortunately wasn't very far.  So if you need a rental car with a pickup, call the one on Baseline near the railroad tracks. Even though I had a car reserved at THIS location and had called for a ride, they never, ever called or came to my location to get me.  They lost out on what is now an over three month rental.

I has a much better experience the second time I came in.  The guys were helpful and informative.  And cheerful.  They didn't have the car we needed but gave us lots of good info.

My daughter and I went in here the first time in mid September about a week after my granddaughter was born at lunch time and we both ordered breakfast foods. The food was pretty good the service was good as far as I remember and I wanted to go back sometime,  maybe try the lunch menu.   We went back last night and had a totally different experience. It was late and we did have 2 children with us, the baby who is now 3 months old and her 2 year old brother. We had just been to the Phoenix Children's Museum for their free Friday night sponsored by Target and we were all tired and hungry. We came in here in the hope that we could get something to eat so we wouldn't have to cook when we got home. In fact we picked this place because it is a "family restaurant"  and we expected it to be "kid-friendly".   Wrong.   The  little boy was understandably fussy so I appreciate that this was not something fun for the waiter but at the same time when you're in the service industry sometimes you just have to deal with it when things happen like a fussy 2 year old. We did the best we could to keep it under control. I ended up taking him outside twice to soothe and distract him. We ordered his meal first and asked the waiter could he please make sure that got put in while we decided what we wanted to eat and actually the 2 year old was fine once his food arrived (until he'd finished eating his fill).    It took us awhile to order because of the distractions. I ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, side of onion rings, my daughter got a cheeseburger with french fries, he got some sort of chicken tenders Kids Meal with french fries, which we were all munching on because we were hungry. Because he was tired he started getting antsy again once he was done. I finally convinced my daughter to call the dad and have him come get the child so we could eat in peace. I waited to ask our server for a container to put the rest of the toddler's food in but he never showed up so I chucked the water out of a paper cup and put the food in there. I went up to the manager at the cash register to let him know I was stepping outside just to give the food to the mom and he ignored me and didn't respond, even picked up the phone as if he was making a phone call. Rude! I just didn't want him to think I was skipping out on the bill.   The bottom line is that the waiter, Lyle, was  not polite to us. He was as cranky as the 2 year old. I understand it was difficult for him but it's his job to be as pleasant as possible to his customers regardless and we certainly weren't doing or saying anything to be rude to him. Obviously we were struggling just to be able to order and to read the menu. He let it be known he was not happy with us which I'm NOT used to. I'm used to a really nice waiters and waitresses and servers and just don't have a problem with people because I'm a nice friendly person myself.   I pretty much always tip 20%, I mean it's been years since I left less than a 20% tip, I can't even REMEMBER the last time I left less than 20%. But last night our bill came to $ 21.89 and I just added added  $1.11 to the credit card receipt because the service was so bad.    From the time he brought the food till we were done and sitting there waiting, it was 30 minutes and he never even stopped by to see if there was anything else we needed, and we could've used more napkins and water.   The manager was also very unfriendly. I'm staying in a motel and eat out everyday so I know how servers and managers are supposed to act. This place has had several other reviewers complain about the service and management and I wonder why they don't heed the criticisms and try to improve. I know I won't be back, and neither  will my daughter.   Mesa has a plethora of wonderful little restaurants and cafes with good food, and good service and good prices so there's no reason to patronize a place that doesn't measure up. I've been the person behind the counter who had difficult customers and unruly children and I did my best to tolerate and help them out so they would leave with a favorable impression of my business and want to return. Nobody ever died from being nice.

A Plus!    My daughter tried to tell me about this place on my last visit but I took it with a grain of salt since I wanted a REAL Post Office to weigh and mail things at.  I stopped in here Sunday July 3rd since the REAL PO was closed and discovered what a delightful place this is!  Not only does it have tons of balloons and gift ideas, but miles of racks of costumes and accessories.  And sure enough, in the far back right corner there is a REAL postal counter with a scale and during business hours a REAL postman ready and wiling to help you out, sell you stamps, send your packages etc.  And it is closer and more convenient than the REAL PO with plenty of parking and little to no lines.  It is also next to a Starbucks if you are into that, and a Soup and Salad restaurant if you need a meal.  I'm sure glad I finally stopped in!

Dec. 2010: I ended up here by accident, having gone to Golden Corral to try out their dinner only to be told at the door that they were closed for an employee party.  I spent about 15 minutes in their parking lot (phone server was running slow) poring over my options in the area and decided to give this place a try.  It was about 8pm.  It wasn't crowded at all so I was seated right away. The waitress kind of surprised me when she plopped down across from me and started talking to me like I was somebody she knew, but I kind of got a kick out of it.  I had looked at the menu and the hostess told me on the way in that her favorite was the sirloin so I decided to get it. It was under $11, which I thought was reasonable. It came with two sides so I got green beans and seasoned rice.  Rolls are provided right away and there is a bucket of peanuts on the table to hold you while you wait.  The rolls were excellent, soft and yeasty, with a cinnamon butter that was delicious but sweet and better suited for dessert.  The green beans were kind of salty but cooked in bacon and had good flavor, the rice was unimpressive, sort of reminded me if a rice-a-roni, but that steak was perfect!  It was so tender I barely needed a knife to cut it and had a nice grilled flavor.    I found out they had an early bird special menu and returned 10 days later to try it.  I got a  Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with sides of Caesar Salad and mashed potatoes.  For a dollar extra I got them "loaded," topped with grated cheese, butter, onions, sour cream and a side of brown gravy--more toppings than potatoes!  All were good although the steak was very salty.    I wanted to get back there again before I left town but didn't make it since I returned to San Diego a week later.  Nov. 2012:  I'm back in town and finally got back here, barely squeaked in by the 6pm deadline for the early bird steak dinner.  I ordered fast and my waitress submitted it a minute to six!  This time it was a 6-oz sirloin with sides of green beans (very bacon-y but not so salty this time), and mashed potatoes.  Because of the rush when she asked if I wanted the potatoes loaded I just said yes and forgot to ask if it was extra.  It was.  I think they should let you know this.  I probably still would've gotten it for a dollar but I think it's fair to tell people.  When she asked if I wanted the steak "smothered" I did think to ask if that was extra, and she said yes it was 99cents.  It turned out it was $1.99.  So my $8.50 steak dinner ended up an $11.50 dinner, not so much of a bargain.  Next time I'll know. But she should have told me the truth.  Other than that she was a great waitress, checked back frequently to make sure everything was ok, etc.  I would return because the steak is so good.  And I should mention that it was extremely busy on a Wednesday night at 6pm, so there must be a lot of people happy with the place.

I don't know how they manage to find such pleasant and helpful employees at every location I've been to but I never have a problem getting help, never get an attitude when I ask a question even if they are in the middle of stocking shelves etc.  They always stop what they're doing to answer my question and usually walk me to the section where the item would be if they have it.  They are more congenial than Disneyland employees!  On top of that, the prices are unbelievabley reasonable on most products and the quality is exellent.  I love that it is a manageable sized store where I'm not exhausted when I leave, even if I have to backtrack to find something.  They may not have the multitude of samples of a Costco, but what they offer is fun to try and many times I've gone to buy the product after tasting it.  And they have some if the prettiest, sturdiest, most colorful tote bags of any store so I almost always buy one, often as gifts for my kids.  I now have bags from three states.    I got started shopping more often at my local TJ's  and other smaller stores in San Diego years ago when there was a grocery store union strike and just never went back to the big chains except when I needed products not available at TJ's.  I love it when I find one when I travel as I'm already familiar with their products and layout.

I was happy to find a couple pairs of purple slacks--which I hadn't seen in there for years, but on the way out I slipped in a puddle of what appeared to be spilled soap.  I didn't fall, just slid, but it scared me.  Yikes!  There was only one person ahead of me in line so as soon as she was done I notified the cashier about the spill.  He didn't look too concerned so I added, "If an older person falls in that it's automatic broken bones."  Still no reaction.  "Guaranteed" I said.    He proceeded to ring up my 4 items. As one, then two more customers came up behind me, I warned them to watch out for the puddle.  After I paid, he hollared to someone to get somebody over for a cleanup.  I went to find a manager.  At customer service the gal wouldn't call a manager but listened to me relate the situation.  I told her, the safety of your customers should have been more important than me, than ringing up my sale before cleaning it up or marking it to warn others.  I was willing to wait.  I still didn't feel like was being taken seriously so here I am telling it again.   Is anybody listening?

I love 5 and Diners and I feel bad giving this one a bad review but really there were so many mistakes made I just can't bring it up to 3 stars.   On the good side I really liked our server Valerie.   On the bad side I ordered a cheeseburger with chips and what I was brought was a bacon burger or bacon cheeseburger, whichever, with fries. I noticed the fries right away and told her I had ordered chips so she took it back and switched them, but I didn't notice that the cheeseburger had bacon on it until after I took a bite. It did taste good so I decided to go ahead and eat it and see which one I was charged for. The bacon one of course was a dollar more.    She had asked how I wanted the meat prepared and one of the things I liked about 5 and Diner is the fact that you could get your meat cooked just the way you like it. I told her medium rare. She repeated it back to me but when the hamburger arrived it was actually more medium than rare. It tasted great but there was no pink in it at all so that was a disappointment. One reason I'd  been anxious to return to the Arizona Mills location was because the meat was so delicious  and cooked perfectly, grilled outside, pink inside.  It was still good so I  decided to go ahead and eat it. She didn't come back to fill our water until we asked although she did ask us several times did we need anything. I did have tummy issues the next day. I won't go into details.  The milkshake was delicious. I forgot to order malt in it which is 50 cents more.  She was nice enough to divide it between 2 to-go cups because the kids were getting fussy so we had 2 generous  cups with chocolate cherry milkshake for about $4.59. Both of the hamburger meals were just pennies away from 10 dollars each which I personally think it's kind of high for a hamburger.   We had the opportunity to ask Valerie if she knew what had happened to the 5 and Diner at Arizona Mills and she told us she had been the owner of it and it broke her heart to have to close it but the shopping center assessed some very high tax fees on the business that was more than she could afford to pay even though business was booming. You know you can't just pay all your income out on taxes, rent and such, you gotta make something.   I would honestly hesitate to go back to this location because of all the errors that were made and the tummy problems I had the next day. Maybe next trip I will try the Scottsdale location because it seems to have really good reviews.

When I was here two years ago I remember really liking the potato salad and the pie, especially the really good pie crust, but not being highly impressed with the BBQ sauce and rib. Today the whole thing meal wowed me. I got the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with potato salad on the side and all were delicious. The pulled pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender and there was a generous portion on the $5.99 sandwich. It was mild in flavor and not over salted. The BBQ sauce was not overly spicy nor overly sweet and was perfect on the pork. Even the pickle slice, while not very big, was delicious and top quality. I'll have to come back to try the Italian Beef and Catfish.

I just stopped in to pay my bill for internet service on the iPad.  The first time I walked in I was greeted with a big smile and told it would be just a minute.  That guy left and didn't come back.  I waited a reasonable amount of time, then left to run into Kinkos next door, my real reason to be in this center, to use their monster paper cutter. Then I popped into Sprint on the other side to ask a couple questions.  I came back in here where I was again greeted cheerfully except this time I was helped right away by a different rep.  The young man couldn't have been more pleasant or efficient.  Unlike the Verizon store near where I live in San Diego, there was no hardcore, high pressure sales pitch to fend off.  Thank you guys, I appreciate just being able to take care of business and head on out.    Minus one star for the guy who abandoned me and plus four for the guy who treated me like the good customer I am.

We loved this place!  My daughter and I came here twice last trip and had great food and service both times.  I'm from San Diego and usually figure why order seafood from places that aren't even near the ocean?  But the Seafood Brochette was just wonderful.  I had the Blue Corn Drink the second time I came here and it was very sweet but good.  Unique.  Unfortunately when I finally got here this trip I found it to be closed and totally empty.  I was very disappointed.  I had beeen looking forward to coming back here.

Darned good chicken!   Unlike a previous reviewer I've had nothing but good experiences at Church's Chicken here in Mesa. When it gets too late to go anyplace else and I need something to eat Church's is close and easy and fast and cheap. Not only that but it tastes good. I usually prefer dark meat but sometimes I forget to tell them and get white meat, either way it's extremely moist and tender and juicy.  I've never gotten a bad batch with an unacceptable coating or meat.   The biscuits are so good I want to eat them like cookies! I've gotten a half gallon of the sweet tea for 2 bucks on sale in hot weather and it lasted me several days in my motel room.  I tried the Apple Turnover once and it was very good. This trip I've gotten the $2.99 special two different times that has a biscuit with 2 pieces of chicken, usually a thigh and leg but today I got a thigh and a breast.  It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too. On past trips I've  sometimes stopped by and gotten 3 or 4 pieces just to keep in the refrigerator so that if I don't feel like going out to eat I've got something on hand.    Oh, and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it. Church's Chicken has never let me down.  Even the mashed potatoes and gravy weren't bad. They certainly weren't  overly salty even though I know they were made from a mix.  Now if I could just get Church's Chicken to open one near where I live in San Diego.....

I came here about a week ago when it was almost 10pm and a lot of places were closed, looking for a light meal to keep me from getting hungry later in the evening since I'm a night owl.  I ordered a small bowl of soup which happened to be on sale for about $1.59, a chicken tamale to try for $1.29 I think, and a drumstick off their value (99 cent) menu.  All three were delicious, hit the spot, and were the perfect amount of food for under $5 to tide me over.  I was especially impressed with the flavor of the soup, though it was served way to hot and I had to wait a long time for it to cool down enough to eat.  I went there again a few nights later because I got a craving for more of that chicken tortilla soup, this time ordering the larger size, still on sale, about $3.69 for a pretty big container.  I asked if they could not make it so hot this time, so it was my fault it cooled down to barely warm by the time I'd finished the $2.50 steak taco I got on the side.  I only intended to eat half the soup but it was so good I couldn't stop till I'd wiped out three fourths of it.    It's handy having this place be so close to my motel.  Now that the weather is turning chilly I'll probably be back for more of that soup!  For the second time in one day I encountered a restroom that was out of TP, but here they responded quickly, with concern and apologies, with one of the clerks hurrying back immediately to remedy the problem, a far better reaction than I got at Stein Mart at Tempe Marketplace earlier in the day.

This place is as good as I'd heard.  We came here for a day-late birthday dinner for my middle daughter/Father's Day dinner for her husband.  She and his six-year old daughter ordered a Hawaiian style with pineapple and ham, he and I  got the Margherita Pizza with garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, fresh basil, mozzarella, and romano cheese.  Both were so delicious!  He also got some chicken wings which were tender and juicy and not spicy at all, dipped in either of two great sauces, ranch or marinara.  The pizza's were about $13 each for the larges.  I usually have no problem quitting after two slices but the  flavor squishing around in my mouth was so good I couldn't resist taking a third piece at this place.   The decor was pretty and the service was great--the server checked back several times to see if we were doing okay or needed anything.   I would definitely be a regular if I lived near here.     On a side note, next door is the Aloha Kitchen which we had eaten at about a week ago and was also very good!  62010

I go to this 99 Cents Only Store more often than the one near me in San Diego I think!  Every time I need anything they carry, I'm here buying it--things for my daughter, cleaning supplies, kitchen gadgets and supplies, condiments and baking mixes, snacks, you name it.    Yes, the lines can be long when they're busy but the clerks are always helpful and enough if them speak good English that I can usually get my questions answered, not always the case at my home store.    One advantage to shopping here is I'm already familiar with the layout because of shopping at the one at home.  Another is that I never have  to price compare or fish for coupons since everything is the same price.   I will keep coming here when I'm in town as long as they can keep my household and travel needs met.

I've eaten here three times this trip (so far) and all three have been good.  Plus I've eaten here on previous trips at least a coupla times.  I've had  breakfasts, steak and eggs, chili, and pork chops with eggs most notably.  See photos of all.   Surprisingly, the only thing that was a disappointment was the waffle, a bit incongruous considering their name and assumably their claim to fame is the waffle.  Most places would be $10 and up for steak or pork chops.  Here it's closer to $8, depending on the size you get.  Both were perfectly good.  And there just aren't a lot of places that offer grits.  They do and they're good.  So are the biscuits and gravy, Texas Toast and chili.    The service has always been good and even the cooks are friendly.  It's clean and the tabletops aren't sticky, no easy task to clean considering the amount of syrup that passes over these tables.  This is one of those chains I make an exception for because they are reasonable, have good food, and are pretty consistant.  Since there are none in San Diego, I will continue to enjoy this one on my trips to the Mesa, Az area.

My meal here turned out to be a very odd experience.  The good:  I was greeted and seated right away, a glass of water and menu were provided immediately.  The water was refilled expeditiously.  While it didn't smell as fragrant as Pho Nhan did when I entered, it did smell good.    I saw a mix of Asians and others (including one not-too-polite redneck farmer who talked way too loud on his cell phone at the table) but enough of the former to feel this was a popular place for Vietnamese.  I wouldn't trust a pho place full of only white people.  Scary thought.  The eggrolls were delicious!  They were more garlicky than ones I've had in the past and it was that kind of garlic that you keep taking bites of and wanting more of.  The veggies were fresh and crisp, the shell was crisp and delicately flaky, the dipping sauce was perfect.  I could have eaten a whole meal of just these.    The bad: After being seated and provided water and menu I was summarily ignored for at least 15 minutes.  THIS I'm not used to.  Someone else would have left.  The waiter was sitting a a table in full view of me about four tables away and purposely did not make eye contact or walk by, much less come to my table.  What's the problem, Dude??  Well, you know what, I can usually out-stubborn anybody, though thankfully don't often need to, so I decided to sit there till Hell froze over.  Eventually an older man came out to bring another table their food.  He saw me sitting there, hands politely folded on menu, smile on my face, obviously ready to order, snapped some orders at the younger guy, who then came over to take my order at long last.  I got the aforementioned eggrolls and a bowl of soup that included duck leg and bamboo.  My phone died before I could take a photo of the menu as I sometimes do to remember the name of the dish.  The guy checked with me if I wanted the one with bamboo and I said yes, but my antennae went up.  As he was leaving the table he hesitated and asked, "You work over there?" Pointing to the west.  I told him no, I was visiting from San Diego because I had a new granddaughter.  He brightened up at that and was perfectly nice after, so I can only guess he thought I was someone else initially, someone not worthy of his attention.  Working where?  After eating the delectable egg rolls and being extremely impressed, the large bowl of soup arrived and emitted such a putrid smell I didn't know if it was from the person serving it or the dish itself.  It honestly smelled like someone had pooped in it, or in their pants nearby.  I told myself not to let my imagination run wild, thinking of stories describing slaves who defecated in their owners food, ewww. I had gone through so much to get it that I didn't want to send it back.  As I took bites and spoonfuls I pretty much narrowed it down to the bamboo being the culprit causing the bad smell and taste.  And it was not inedible, just took some getting used to.  I kept telling myself I probably had just never eaten bamboo before and maybe it's an acquired taste like Limburger(sp?) cheese, or liver.  Whatever, I ate it and while I barely made it to my motel bathroom after leaving the restaurant (don't ask), I had no further  gastronomic problems from the food, and that could have been caused by eating exotic food after having nothing to eat all day.  If the food had been "bad" I'm sure I would have reacted to it during the night or next day.  I'm trying to talk myself into giving them three stars because those egg rolls were so good but the more I remember sitting there being purposely ignored, the more I acknowledge how impolite and unprofessional that was so I'm going to make it two stars.  Sorry guys, next time tend to your customers.  I eat out every day and this place is very near my motel so I would have loved to add it into my rotation of eateries.

Well, this is the third motel I've stayed in in 4 nights and the first one that I had no problems with--clean room i stayed in for two nights, friendly helpful clerks and convenient location.  It didn't smell like smoke either!  I had a handicapped room both nights and liked the nice big bathroom!  Yay!

Disappointing.    I was looking for the Denny's near here and came across this, ironically in the same center as the "My Arep,a" Venezuelan place I had discovered a couple of weeks ago.  I figured what the heck, I'll get a cheap breakfast here instead of Denny's.  And I know they have good coffee because I buy their ground coffee at Target and WalMart when it's on sale--REALLY good stuff.  But the donut was so much worse than what I've had (seldom) at Krispie Kreme, and the breakfast sandwich was just adequate.  Thank goodness the coffee was still good.  I got the vanilla flavored one and a decaf vanilla for my refill to go.  I doubt I'll go back--to this one or any other if this is a sample of their donuts.  I don't eat them often enough to waste the experience on bad quality.

Yup, found it on Yelp.  And it wasn't very far from where my daughter whom I 'm visiting lives, so it only took me a couple of days to get here.  She came with me.  I got the Korean bol-go-ki- barbeque which tasted wonderful.  It came with a potato/macaroni salad and a scoop of white rice. I enjoyed all and had some leftovers to save for dinner.  My skeptical daughter (not the adventurous one of my three) just got a scoop of the mac and potato mixture.  She wasn't real keen on it and said she'd rather have them separate.  I also ordered one of the Manapua rolls. It was okay, but not as wonderful as the reviews.  I don't think there was anything wrong with it, just not my thang I guess.  The owner couldn't have been any nicer and I'm sorry I didn't know about this place (or Yelp at that point) when I was in Chandler for 9 months in 2007.  I'm collecting too many favorites to come to when I'm in town!

Mmmmm....everything I've had here has been excellent!  My first visit I had the Korean Beef Bulgogi plate, small size for $5.  It was just as I remembered it from a place in Ocean Beach I used to go to, closed for years.  Instead of the usual mac salad, they serve a potato/mac mixture.  I liked it, my daughter didn't.  We tried one of the manapuas I heard people rave about but it wasn't my thang.  Probably an acquired taste so if you like them, I heard they were good here.    Other visits I've had the salmon plate and the pork specials offered only on Wednesdays and Saturdays.  One time I had a shrimp plate that was the best one yet!  Yesterday it was the "Hawaiian Plate" with Kalua Pig and Cabbage, Lomi Salmon (like Ceviche with salmon), and the mac salad mix.  It was supposed to come with Chicken Long Rice but they were out of it so I just had white rice.  Everything was wonderful.  My daughter wasn't real hungry so she just got the 2 teriyaki beef stick side dish, $2.25, which I had a taste of.  Real good!  My plate was so big I took half home for leftovers.    I will keep coming back here!

I highly recommend this place!  I called around to several storage facilities looking for a place to stash some items cheap and this was definitely the least expenseve place I found, also close and convenient to my home base when I'm in AZ.  For a small space, all I needed, it was only $20/mo.  Not only that but the lady I dealt with at the front desk couldn't have been nicer.  They are low tech, be aware, to keep down the costs.  They don't take credit cards and you can't pay online.  So I just mail them a $20 bill every month with a SASE envelope so they can mail me a receipt and I have never had a problem.    I highly recommend them!

This place rescued my mother more than once over the years and were very helpful to me when I needed extra keys made and when I had questions about how to operate the "keyless entry" lock on the front door.  I had the combination but needed the technique and they gave me enough suggestions that I was able to figure it out.  My worst fear was that I would lock myself out and not be able to get back in if I couldn't work the combination.  Thanks for all your help guys!

This was my Mother's Denny's.  She loved to go here!  She wasn't much for experimenting with wild exotic food like me.  She always suggested either Floridino's or Denny's, or take out from Boston Market.  We always had good meals here.  One of my fav's was the shrimp skewers, which I got more than once.  I think they were only $5.99 or $6.99 for 10  shrimp and two sides.  It might have been from the senior menu.  Whatever, it was always delicious and just the right amount of food, well cooked and well-flavored.  The service was efficient and friendly also.  Pretty consistent, which was probably what she liked.  No surprises.    I miss going there with her.  (Sniff)

My middle daughter moved to Arizona a couple of years ago and really missed the San Diego-style Carne Asada Burritos she was used to.  Everytime she would come home she would hit Chili Banditos/Buenos Dias for her "fix".  Then she discovered Los Favoritos and called me excitedly to let me know she had finally found a Taco Shop that had carne asada burritos the way she liked them.  When I came to Chandler she made sure to bring my family here to try it out and we liked it too.  She's been eating here every since.  Smart daughter.

Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a chain.  But it was there for us when we needed it.  My mother wasn't eating well on her own and my middle daughter lived in Mesa, not too far, so she would stop by Boston Market and pick up a couple of dinners on the way to visit her and they would have a nice visit and meal together.  Since Mother always liked what my daughter brought and ate well, at least we knew she was getting good nutrition from it and some leftovers for the next day.    When I was in town I would stop by there too  I always liked their sides and would sometimes just get a vegetarian plate of just the sides.  I liked their roast sirloin or whatever they call it too, for the price.  And their desserts were pretty good.  I liked that they had dishes that you don't find in most fast food places.  I never had a problem with anything I ate from there and they were pretty consistent in their quality so I give it four stars on a sliding scale compared to other fast food establishments.  I'd go back anytime I'm in the mood for good old American comfort food.

I've been here about three times and it is on my places to go list for when I visit Chandler.  The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it.  It was not a disappointment, in fact was one of the best fish dinners I ever remember having.    I don't remember what I got the other times but know I enjoyed it.  I like the decor and if I remember right, they gave me some Mardi Gras necklaces I still have.  I will definitely go back next trip there.

I only got to this place once while I was in Arizona and really intended to go back--maybe next trip!.  They had really wonderful spaghetti with white clam sauce, an item I often try but rarely find as good as my home place in California--San Fillipo's in La Mesa.  My daughter got the calzones, which she had had here before and knew they were good.  I had a taste and while that is an item I never order, they were delicious!  The atmosphere here was very nice also and I was really glad we had chosen it.  It's one I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to others.

I cannot praise these guys high enough.  When my brother and I were finishing emptying my mothers house because it had sold (sniff) I wanted to make sure her grandchildren, our kids, got plenty of keepsakes.  Some of it I had packed to ship but they didn't think it would make it so they completely repacked entire China sets (4 of them) to ship to Austin and Dallas, Texas and Chicago, along with many other breakable items to be distributed among the 4 out of town grands, plus stuff to my brother's and nephew's in Amarillo.    We were in there every day for several days in a row taking stuff to them to ship.  It did cost us an arm and a leg but how do you put a price on keepsakes and family heirlooms?  The important thing is every item in every box arrived safely at its destination!  This all happened last September '07, but since I was in Chandler for my cousin's funeral this week, I made sure to stop by this place before I left town to let them know how much I appreciated the care with which they packed and handled everything.  The owners, Michelle and James, remembered me and were just as nice as I remembered them to be.    If you ever need to be sure something of value reaches its destination safely, this is the place to go!

I had a great experience with this Ultimate Eletonics!  I came in  to see what they had in the way of carpet cleaners (only one I think) and coffee makers (didn't have the one I want) and as long as I was in here I took a walk-thru to other sections because you just never know what you'lll find in a new store.    I happened onto their clearance section, and there was just what I'd been looking for in San Diego unsuccessfully but  hadn't found yet, and wouldn't have thought to look for in here.  It was a small speaker abou the size of a basketball that picked up a wireless signal from a transmitter you connect to another device to receive a wireless signal in another room (or outdoors).  I like to listen to the Sirius Radio stations I ge t on my Satellite TV when I'm in the kitchen but hate having to turn the bedroom TV up full blast to be able to hear it in the kitchen area.    Just as I was analysing the unit, a salesman came in the area I was in and was able to answer most of my questions about it.  I felt confident this was what I'd been lookiong for and he rang it up for me.  I was so glad I'd taken the time to take a look around before leaving.  And the service I got was as good as it gets.  When I track down my paperwork I'll add his name here.  If I have electronic needs the next time I'm in town I will definitely stop in here to see what they have again.

I've been in this place before over the years and always had a good experience.  The man who runs it is so very nice and welcoming and cheerful (and sometimes flattering!).  Tonight I was just looking for a place that was open after 9pm, when most non-chain places seem to close.  I skirted in here just beforehis  9:30pm closing and ordered a "House Fried Rice" with shrimp, beef and chicken, small size.  It was still warm when I got back to my daughter's apartment and I dove right it.  It was the best fried rice I'd had in a long time, not gummy like some, not too salty like some, just right, and only $6.  It was more than enough and I couldn't finish it so I'll have leftovers for tomorrow.  I'm sure glad I made it there in time.  I recommend this small Mom and Pop place.  It's been here for years.

I only got here once and meant to get back before I left town but just never made it.  I had the pho at the recommendation of my waitress and she was right--it was delicious!  I will definitely try to go again next time I am in town!

I've probably been to this Michael's more than any other in AZ since it was the one closest to where I was living the nine months I was here in 2007.  I usually get here two to three times every time I come to town to visit.  They have a nice clean store, well organized and stocked.  Some of the clerks are nice, friendly and helpful.  Some probably couldn't care if their customers are dead or alive.  I love to come in here with my coupons and get some item I've been wanting for 40 or 50 percent off.  Unfortunately they now only take one coupon per day, where before you could use two or three as long as they were different (i.e. one frome the newspaper, one in the Tuesday flyers, one printed off the internet, one from Joann's, etc.)    I did have a slightly bad experience on my most recent visit.  I came in the front door and didn't see any of the small baskets. I had to go looking for them, which was a nuisance.  I heard one of the clerks complaining a few minutes later about the baskets not being conveniently located and chimed in from my aisle. "I'm a customer and I agree!"  I encountererd one of those clerks (not the one who made the comment) who seemed to not appreciate customer input.  Hmmmm.  Then she admitted it was the manager who said they had to be stationed where they are, instead of just inside the front door where we could pick one up easily.  But she stilll didn't seem very receptive.  When I owned my own business I was nice to even the jerkiest customers because when you are in sales, that's just what you do.

After the Sun Lakes True Value Hardware location turned a cold shoulder to me, this one pulled through, both in emails and in person.  I received the help I needed, found the product I was looking for, recommended by a teacher at a local craft store, purchased it, and left happy.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back here again!

We went here for sandwiches but they said they haven't sold sandwiches for over a year.  I was basing my quest on a review that was just about a year old alright.  What they DO sell is wonderful, marvelous looking and smelling bread and cakes for as little as 50 cents and a dollar.  Wow!  I didn't buy any but I made sure my daughter took note as money is tight for them and this place fits in their budget.  I wish I had one of these in San Diego!  As good as this, I mean.  I don't know when they open (early I bet) but they close about 3 o'clock.

I came in here my first day in AZ this trip to see if they had any of the lavender clogs I had bought in San Diego and liked so much.  They didn't have any in this store but the clerk was very helpful and called their outlet in Phoenix, north of the airport, to find that they do have some. I haven't gotten there yet but still intend to go up there and buy a couple more pairs.  This store has some beautiful uniforms--I just wish they were 100% cotton---if they were I'd buy one of those beautiful tops even though I'm not in the medical field!

You know you are in a bad section of town when the greeter at the Walmart doesn't even smile back at you or say "Welcome to Walmart!" when you walk in.  I mean, they get PAID to do that!   And I always smile and say hi to them.  Nor was the cashier in any way friendly when I checked out.  I only went here because the very nice gal at the one on Rural said this one had a bigger inventory and might have what I was after.  I'll never go back here unless enough time goes by that I forget this bad experience.     No wonder this place has such bad reviews.

I've been to this Boston Market at least three times now, once a coupla years ago on my last trip to Az when my daughter and I were looking for a fast place to grab a bite before a movie at the Tempe Cinema Theater and then I rediscovered it by Yelping the neighborhood for the same purpose a couple of weeks ago.  That time I grabbed a quick Rotisserie Chicken Plate, dark meat (my favorite), with sides of Rotisserie Chicken Noodle Soup (unlimited refills but I didn't have time to partake of that), cornbread, broccoli (gotta get my veggies in when possible), and sweet potatoes casserole.  Other than being a little salty, which concerns me for health reasons, and the casserole being pretty sweet, everything was delicious and I wished I hadn't had to rush thru it but didn't want to eat popcorn on an empty stomach.  It made mighty fine leftovers the next day, too.  I attempted to go back a week later to try the Turkey Plate but discovered after I parked that I had worn the wrong shorts with my money and cards in the other pair back at the motel.  By the time I drove back there it was too late for the movie so I just ate near my motel and called it a night.    Last night I made sure I was properly financed and headed over to this Boston Market again.  As soon as I walked in I was  enveloped in wonderful aromas that made my mouth water.  I ordered the Turkey Plate with cornbread, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes for about $8 including tax.  Now, I'm a dark meat fan, but that turkey breast was so moist and tender and flavorful I was an instant fan.  I could cut it with a fork, no knife needed.  The only problem was for whatever reason, it wasn't hot, just sort of tepid, even borderline cool in spots.  Because I was hungry and headed for another movie across the street I didn't say anything because it tasted so good.  The spinach and mashed potatoes were hot, just not the meat.    Later in the meal a worker walked by and asked how everything was so I politely let her know the everything was delicious accept the meat wasn't hot when served to me.  A man who may have been a manager overheard me and insisted on bringing me a fresh serving of turkey even tho I told him it wasn't necessary.  I ate most of it there because it was even better warm, and added the rest to my leftovers for lunch today.  Needless to say I was highly impressed with this level of customer service.  The only other issue I had was when I first sat down I found the chair to be quite loose and wiggly so I switched to the chair next to it.  When the same man mentioned earlier walked by I mentioned to him about the chair.  He tested it, agreed it was not acceptable, and immediately removed it from service, thanking me for letting him know.  Again, I was impressed by how quickly a customer's concerns we're responded to.  I'm actually looking forward to returning here to have some of their Beef Brisket and maybe more turkey and soup.

Like most Savers this store is huge (former supermarket locale) with tons of merchandise, most of it in very good condition.  I got three tops and a Hawaiian dress.  My daughter got several tank tops for a trip she's taking, the reason we were there in the first place.  I like this store. (4/09)

I got the Fettucini Alfredo.  There was a little implied pressure to order a drink and to add grilled chicken to my Fettucini.  The parking lot nearly empty.  I liked the fun music from the 60's.  My pasta was excellent,  creamy and really good.  The garlic bread was perfect.  I look forward to coming back here sometime.

No complaints.  I walked in and told them the low pressure light had come on in my car.  They had me pull into the booth with no lift, checked the tires, added about 5 lb to each tire, and sent me on my merry way.  Total time there about 10 minutes, if that.  No charge of course.  Even if you didn't buy the tires there, this is a courtesy service they offer.  And I should mention this is also the location my daughter frequents and has been happy with.

Grandma's Kitchen was a wonderful find.  Fresh delicious food in a bright clean atmostphere.  There is a little play area where kids can entertain themselves while the grownups visit making this the most peaceful meal we've had with the 6 year old.  My Egg Salad on marble rye and potato salad ($6.50) tasted just like my mother made.  They were made with nothing but the basic ingredients.  The bread was soft and fresh.  Good iced coffee for only a buck-fifty.   My daughter got a Croissant Club ($8.50) she said was top quality.  The kids meal was $4.50 for a hot dog, applesauce, cookie and drink, and my new granddaughter ate every bit of it.  The peach cobbler was okay but not to die for.  But our overall experience was just great.   I highly recommend this place--and my fellow Grandma makes everything personal.  Hours are roughly 7am to 3pm but she was stilll making sandwiches for walk-ins at 4pm in spite of cleaning up.  I like a business that puts serving their customers first.  There is plenty of seating and we lucked out and were able to park right out front.  There are a few tables outside, but considering it was, like, 112 degrees out, we chose the cool inside tables.  Thanks to Yelp for helping me find this spot, though my daughter had been to it before and also gave it good marks.  I'll be back!

I like this KMart.  I don't get to KMarts much because there aren't any near where I live so when I get a chance to stop in one I go.  I don't think they are as much cheesy, cheap, fun as they used to be back in the old days of my childhood, teens and young adulthood, back when you could get those cheap ham and cheese sandwiches (4 for a dollar I think?) and ice cream cones in the stores.  If you're looking for super cheap prices stick to Big Lots and 99 cent stores.  But KMarts have gotten in some cute baby and kids clothes over the last few years, and it's refreshing to see the holiday clothes they have because they are different and somewhat cuter than the same old, same old at Target and Walmart.  I saw no bargains in the stationary department, no cheap beer like Walgreen, no impressively low prices in food and coffee.  That's probably why I don't go back for a year.  But I still enjoy shopping here once in awhile, just for a change.  My special find this trip was a package of self-threading needles in the small sewing section, longer than the ones I already have and therefore easier to grip and stitch with.  That alone was worth the trip in.  And a package of diaper pins, handy to keep around for odd jobs and you don't find them around much any more with everyone using disposables these days..  Because I was here in mid-November they have a LOT of holiday stuff out, and have extended open hours.

This is certainly the biggest scrapbooking store I have been to in the Chandler area.  I had a $3.50 credit from a return a year and a half ago and they still had it on record on their computer so they took it off my purchase.  I was impressed with that, too. I got there shortly before closing so I didn't have a lot of time to look around but they were very knowledgeable and directed me to each item I asked about or told me if they didn't have it.   (4/23/09)

I have always wanted to go in here and check it out, at various locations, but never did.  Today I passed by here and decided this was a good time to do so.  It was right there and I had the time.  The store was nice and cool (important when it's 111 outside).  The clerks were super nice.  They left me alone when I wanted to just browse but were right there when I had a question or request.  I ended up buying one cute black cotton top with lavender sequined roses on the front and got it for 20% off by filling out an app for a credit card.  The manager even said if I came back within a week I could buy the other one I was looking at for the discount as well.  It's obvious they put customer service as a priority, not becasue of the discount, but because of the overall way I was treated the whole time I was in the store.  I will try to stop by here on future visits to town even though I'm not a big clothes shopper.

This is an A-plus library.  Once I discovered it and hit my daughter up for her library card I started coming in here 2-4 times a week, checking out audio books and DVD's mostly.  I can't tell you how many books I read and movies I saw thanks to them but it was a lot in the nine months I was in Chandler.  I even checked out CD's and burned them at home so I could listen to them while I tooled around town.  The librarians saw me so much they started calling me by name--my daughters name that is.  I told her, if you ever go in there they won't believe you are you because they associate that name with me.  if I'd known I was going to be there for so long I would have gone ahead and gotten my own card using a piece of mail with my name and Chandler address--if they didn't care about the Calif drivers license that is.  I guess I never took that chance.  Another plus is the wonderful little gift shop and snack cafe on the lower floor where they had not only smoothies and coffee but fudge they make on the premises, fresh chilled fruits, and the best chicken salad on croissant sandwiches you've ever tasted--also made from their own recipe on the spot.  There were also turkey and ham sandwiches but I only got the chicken salad it was so good.  Even if I wasn't hungry I would buy one and refrigerate it at home to eat for dinner or lunch the next day.  So I developed my "rounds" in Chandler--go to the PO to mail my eBay packages, the library to turn in movies and books and get new, the rubber stamp store and delis nearby--my own little piece of heaven.

They finally have replaced the lit up sign outside that fell down in about August 2007 which still hadn't been replaced when I was here in August 2008.  I stopped in to check out their garden department but the store was being seriously renovated and rearranged so it was hard to find anything.  After I walked about two miles looking at everything I paid for my purchases and left (4/19/09)

This place is NOT closed!  I just went there last night, to my great pleasure.  I was looking for freshly made Aguas Frescas like I'd had at a little place near my mothers at Alma School and Ray Rd that had closed.  This place had it and I got a giaiant 32 oz container of Cantalope flavored for $2.50.  It was SO  delicious and refreshing!  You white eople don't know what youre missing.  The place was packed with Spanish speaking people who know a good thing when they taste it.  I felt a little out of place but didn't care.  It was worth the wait in line and the embarrassement of not understanding what was being said around me.  A couple of people answered questions for me in line so I knew what to say when it was my turn.  They even give you samples of the ice cream and drinks.  While I was waiting I got aoout a litttle pad of paper and wrote down all the words I didn't know on the menu to look up later.  Here is what I found out:  Nieve=snow (very finely shaved ice that absorbs the flavor rather than just sitting in it).  Liquidos= fruit and milk blended, a Mexican Smoothie.    Elotes=Corn on the cob--on a stick.   Chamoyades=pickled fruit. (Shaved ice with fruit syrup, mango, tamarind, lime or pineapple, drizzled with hot sauce, chamoy, lime juice, plus chili powder and salt).  It is sometimes served with pickled pig skin on top.  Raspado=Shaved ice.  Paletas=Popsicles made with fruit.  Esquimades=Eskimo pies.  Jugos=Juice  Fresas (or Fresas cn Crema)=Strawberries (with cream)  Duros-Spicy "wagon Wheel" crispy chips  Tostiloco=Nachos with lots of stuff on them                    (Tostilocos:  *1 cut open bag Salsa Verde Tostitos *Jicama *Lime juice squeezed over top *Salt and Cayenne Pepper *Tamarind (very, very sour fruit) *Fried Peanuts, Japanese Peanuts *Cucumber *Chamoy (hot sauce, kind of sugary) *Salsa Picante) http://www.flickr.com/photos/guppieluv/2055355301/  Escamoches=Mixed fruit with granola, etc (theres more to it than that)  I probably will have to refine these definitions as I do more research and taste more items but this is a start.

I can't believe nobody has reviewed this wonderful little restaurant yet!  I've been going here for years, first with my parents, who are both from Indiana, then to treat my mother, my husband and kids, even my brother when he was in town.  Where else you gonna find a "breaded pork tenderloin" sandwich!  And it's really good!  They also have great breakfasts.  I had the "Corn Meal Mush" one day and expected a bowl of hot cereal, but it was actually strips of fried cornmeal batter which were delicious with syrup over them.  They came with a generous amount of bacon, too.  They are only open till 2pm so don't dawdle if you want to eat there.  And be sure to try the pork tenderloin!

When I needed beauty products or was just in the mood to shop I would pop in here before or after Walmart to look around.  They always have good sale items and the clerks  are very nice and helpful!

There aren't a lot of places around here that are open past 10 pm but this chain is.  So one evening when I was out late and had eaten a late lunch and wasn't hungry at a normal dinner time, I stopped in here after 11-ish for a bite.    I got a Foot Long Chili Dog special for $2.99 (with onions), a small Tater Tots,  a small cherry slushie, and a small coffee to save and reheat in my motel room the next mornig.  That cheap hot dog was delicious. The Tater Tots were freakin' awesome!  And I don't even like Tater Tots.  But these were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just enough oil to help it crunch with a wonderful texture.   I got my cholesterol and calories and sodium quotients  in for the next month in one simple trip.  Ouila!

5 stars isn't enough for my favorite Rubber Stamp store!  Nic is so creative and knowledgeable and helpful and caring and has the most beautiful stamps and her samples hanging all over the walls are gorgeous and inspiring!  I have made the most beautiful cards in her classes also.  I can't speak highly enough.  She's worth the drive from San Diego to Arizona !  And while you're there visit either of the deli's on each side of her for more friendly atmosphere and wonderful food!  I miss you guys!

When I stop in here after months of being away, I always feel like I'm visiting family or old friends instead of just a store..  And I love seeing what merchandise she's gotten in that's new and different.  I even signed up for a class on Mon 4/20 since I was still in town. We made the most beautiful cards.  It took us nearly 4 hours and we had a lot of fun.  I love cardmaking!  (4/14/09)

My car likes this gas station. That's good enough for me.  Prices aren't the cheapest but not bad.  I can use my credit card and there is no fee.  Most of all, the nozzle stays in my fussy gas tank so I don't have to stand there and hold it like at some stations where it keeps shutting off if I let go of the handle.  There is a squeegee and water available so I can clean my windows.  I'm happy.

I had no problems with this location.  The young man who helped me, Allen, went and got the products I asked for, described them to me with knowledge, and showed me the choices I had.  I bought two products and would have gotten three except they were out of one.  I think I've been coming here since 2007 off and on and I'm sure my father came here for years also. I'll be back next time I need what they carry.

I was definitely very satisfied and happy with the service that I got at Dana Tire.  I can see why there are people who have gone here for years. I actually found them through the Yelp reviews and after comparing their reviews and prices to three other places I decided to bring my car here. It was a bonus that they are only about two blocks from my AZ home so it was an easy walk home and back again today.  The price was fair, total was about $125.   I thought I was going to need an alignment because the steering wheel was jerking when I drove. They took one look and immediately spotted the front left tire had tread separation. I didn't need an alignment after all  As long as I had it in there I asked them if they could check the cooling system, radiator, hoses, etc because I occasionally smell a hot water smell but they looked at that and everything checked out okay.  I also asked them to check out the brakes which make a slight noise when I'm braking but seem to work fine and they said the brakes were good and just made a little noise because they were old .   It's very important to me to have a car that drives safely since I transport my grandchildren frequently so I feel very reassured now that the wheel has been replaced and the cooling system and brakes checked out. The person who worked on the car was Wade. He answered all my questions, did not make me feel like a dumb broad, and explained the work he did . I would not hesitate to go back here again and feel confident to recommend them to others.

We were going to pass my Mother's Toyota Avalon on to my middle daughter (who lives in Mesa) after my mother passed away but were keeping it till the house sold so my brother could use it when he came to town from Amarillo to wrap up our parents' living trust.  A couple of days before he was to turn it over to her he was backing out of the garage and forgot he had the driver's door open a little.  Before he could stop, CRUNCH--the door caught on the side of the garage on the way out and it crumpled the door panel and part of the front left panel.  He was so mad, especially since our parents took such good care of their cars and other possessions that it looked like new in spite of being 11 years old.  He spent the better part of the morning making phone calls, arranging for insurance coverage and locating this place to do the repairs,  Then we had to break the news to my daughter, who was greatly looking forward to getting such a nice car, that she wouldn't get it when she thought.  Chandler Auto Body did a GREAT job of repairing it--when they got done you could not tell anything had ever happened to it.  They were extremely nice to work with and put a guarantee on their work if there were any problems in the future.  When we got it back we passed it on to her and she has made several trips to San Diego to visit me in it.    I definitely recommend this place to others!

I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty.    I Yelp Wendy's and find this one is one just around the corner from where I'm staying. Perfect, methinks!  But when I drive over there I find they are MIA.  So sad.  I have no idea how long they've been gone but I'm SOL tonight.

I had come here in 2007 and liked the store so I decided to come back this trip.   I always forget how long it takes to get here and didn't know I would hit a lot of construction on the way here but once I got here I found it to be the same nice store I remembered with the same nice owner/clerk.  She has a great selection but because I didn't need much it turned out she didn't have the few items I was looking for.  I was still glad I got to go here and look around and I did buy one item I'd been wanting to try.  The parking is a problem as it is in such a popular tourist area the street parking is at a premium.  I discovered a parking garage that waas only about a block to walk to the store (though it took me two blocks since I got turned around--haha!).

I wasn't here very long, just long enough to half kill myself walking five miles, loaded down with carry ons, from my arrival gate to the departure gate.  Ugh.  If you're gonna make people walk halfway across the city for a connecting flight, at least provide some sort of shuttle or something.  NOT an airport I care to go through again.

I came to this IKEA a few times while in Arizona for 9 months of last year.  It is a newer, very nice location.  Two of my favorite things here?    1) Those bags of little colored clips that you use to re-close chips bags and cereal bags and bread bags--they work so much better than the twist ties and little square things that those come with and are cost effective since they are reusable.  I swear by them!  2) I love to eat at the cafeteria upstairs. See my review.

http://www.ikea.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/IkeaNearYouView?storeId=12&catalogId=11001&langId=-1&StoreName=localfood  I love the IKEA Restaurant.   I love the meatballs and the gravy and the lingonberry sauce and the lingonberry drink and their coffee, both regular and decaf. I love their salmon and their shrimp and their pastries and their dill sauce and their little red potatoes and just everything!  I've never had anything there that isn't delicious!  And I love that I can afford it all and even sometimes get two entrees so I can taste both if I haven't been there for awhile.  And I love that not only is it all delicious there but it is all available to buy packaged and/or frozen to take home and enjoy even more!   I love the IKEA Cafeteria.  Sample menu:  Deluxe Breakfast Plate  Scrambled eggs, bacon, Swedish pancakes with lingonberries, potatoes, and coffee.  $1.99    Open-face Shrimp Sandwich  Served open faced on wheat with cold-water shrimp, hard boiled egg, and mayonnaise.  $2.49      FAMOUS SWEDISH MEATBALL PLATE FOR ONLY $4.99 15 Swedish meatballs with potatoes and sweet-tart lingonberries.  BIG SWEDE BREAKFAST PLATE AVAILABLE FOR ONLY $2.99: Scrambled eggs, bacon, Swedish pancakes with lingonberries, potatoes, French toast sticks, sausage patty, and coffee.

This probably was a great little store and I would have loved to shop in it but sadly it was gone as if about six months ago and has become a comic book store now, a pretty cool looking store actually, just no painting supplies.  The owner of the new store couldn't have been nicer though and cheerfully told me where the next closest art supply store was, Utrecht Art Supplies just a couple blocks down University at Rural.

Would you guys PLEASE stop putting Pinoy places in my path that I can't resist stopping at!    I was on my way down Alma School Rd. on my way to Chandler from my daughter's in Mesa when I spotted this place.  I went to the bakery "next door" (open between the two, not two different store fronts) and got a cheese pimento turnover, a chicken turnover/pie, and a Tuna Turnover_ to go, then came back over to the restaurant  side and sat down to order something to eat there.  I did feel like I was being treated as an oddity or an inconvenience rather than an appreciated customer.    Unfortunately they didn't seem to be set up for a singe person eating alone, so I had to order a huge bowl of Sinigang, enough to feed a family of 4 or 5 and then get a container to bring what I couldn't eat home.  The service was a little aloof-maybe they thought I wandered into the place by mistake instead of heading in here on purpose because I like Pinoy food so much.  I would hope if I lived around here and became a regular they would get to know me and be more friendly.  Racial profiling can work both ways of course.    The Sinigang was good, both hot, there on the premises, and cold the next day at home.  I wish I knew a group of people to come in here with! (4/14/09)

I'm sure not  a lot more can be said that hasn't been already in previous reviews but I just had to add my two cents and say this place is wonderful and I'm glad I got back to the Chandler area on a visit so I could have the fortunate experience of eating here (I learned about it on Yelp in San Diego).  I was introduced to pasties on my trip to Michigan last November and had them a few times there and I will tell  you the one I had here was way better than any I had there!  Perfect crust, perfect mixture inside--I just wish I lived near, or that they would open a branch in San Diego area!  I got the lamb and mint pastie and it had a mild but distinct lamb flavor (sometimes I order lamb dishes that just taste like beef so I appreciated this) mixed with the veggies and mint.  Very Delicious.  I would have loved to try a dessert but I was too full and had no frig in my motel to take leftovers back to. The waiters and waitresses were all very friendly, too.  I will definitely add this to my list of must-go places for the next visit!

I haven't been in an FYE for a long time.  I enjoyed having the time to look around in this one on the way home from Phoenix. They have all the CD's and DVD's very organized and are very helpful and knowledgeable.  They also have a lot of tie-in merchandise from movies.  I found a Broadway CD with songs from various shows and one other CD (blanking on the artist).  Both were pretty inexpensive.    I was looking for a certain used movie and they had it but it was $14.99 so I decided to pass.  It was one I'd probably only watch once so I'll just rent it or wait for it to come on HBO.

My middle daughter and I went to the Hale Theater to see the musical Hairspray in July, partly because we love musicals and partly because our cousin Nicole was playing the part of Amber Von Tussle.  This theater is sort of in the round, except it's a square, therefore there is no bad seat in the house. You can see the performance from every angle.  Both the scenery and the actors are constantly changing positions to make themselves visible from all sides.   The performances were absolutely wonderful, the scenery and costumes were great, and we really enjoyed it. The price is very reasonable, I think it was $26 per seat for a totally professional production. I would definitely go back to this theater to see other performances.   The best way to order tickets is probably online and I think there was only a dollar fee to do so.  Picking up tickets at will-call was easy-peasy  At intermission they serve refreshments such as cookies and non-alcoholic drinks.  When the performance is over the actors line up in the lobby where you can walk along tell them how much you enjoyed their performances.  Parking is plentiful and close.   I will definitely be back!

This was awhile back but I never got my review written.  My daughter and I were shopping and decided to eat in the Food Court.  I looked around and of everything I saw on that day, the Stromboli here looked the best.  I was NOT disappointed.  The flavor and texture were wonderful.  It was a good portion for the price also so I had leftovers.  I would get it again but haven't yet because other places have opened that I wanted to try.  Someday!  stromboli!

We needed some lactobacillus reiteri drops for my two month old grandson who was crying constantly from tummy pains.  The doctor had said they could be found at health food stores.  After wasted trips and numerous phone calls to every health food, vitamin store and pharmacy around we were unable to fnd any drops, just tablets and capsules.  Thanks to a Yelp thread I started in this area I was referred to this store where I found the powder form, and for less than half the price of the drops.  The clerks were knowledgeable and helpful, obviously knew their stock and health information.  They advised me on the proper dose and made suggestions.  I left very happy.  Now cross your fingers this product alleviates the poor little guy's discomfort!

I was at Fiesta Mall anyway and wondered if there might be a Verizon location nearby so I could take care of my bill.  Checked on Yelp and sure enough, this one was here.  I asked the nearest security guard where it was and he guided me to practically around the corner on the upper level.  I explained why I was there, gave the account number, and was paid in full plus a month in advance expeditiously.    The young men were pleasant and efficient and did not immediately start applying pressure to upgrade or make any changes to my existing setup like the store near me in San Diego does. I greatly appreciated that.  I would not hesitate to recommend them to others and to return to conduct my business.

Wow,  great store, quality merchandise and good prices! I'd been in here on my last trip but don't remember being this impressed a coupla years ago. I got some cheap yarn, a few items for the little ones, and some craft materials, all for a pittance. I will be back and will tell my daughter to check it out too.   Everything is clean and organized and one lady in particular was extremely helpful. There was a brief turn - off when I first walked in and tried to make eye contact with a young male employee to ask where the craft items were. He turned away from me and started talking to another employee which I thought was rude until I realized he was mentally challenged and probably didn't pick up on the eye contact clue that I needed help. Since I heartily approve of employing the handicapped I quickly forgave the unintentional slight. After that all was good. As much as I like the local Goodwill and Savers stores, this one has won my approval also.

Whoa, way to treat your customers, Dude.  I complimented your store and commented your gas price was 20 cents higher than what I was paying at ARCO so you direct profanity at me?  I guess I won't be patronizing you after all when I make future trips there.  And will advocate my daughter who lives in Mesa refrain from using your establishment.  You need to take a class in Basic PR 101.  If you look at my Quick Tips for both stations you will see I paid $2.63 at the ARCO when your price was $2.83.  How is that not 20 cents difference?  And as far as being stupid, I'm not the one who gave my own business a one star rating.  Hahahaha!    I quote your response to my review since I'm sure Yelp will probably be removing it.  Did you read the Yelp TOS before posting it?  Methinks not.  To summarize. I do not recommend this establishment if they verbally insult their customers, either in person or in writing.  *************  0 2 tony r.

Stopped in here last night on the recommendation of many Yelp reviewers after running errands. I'm glad others mentioned that it was located inside the Mercado.  The door was locked but someone was exiting so I asked if they were open.  The customer, an apparently very intoxicated man, but most pleasant, greeted me and started talking to me like I was an old friend.  The employee, also most pleasant, said they were closed.  When I asked what time they closed she said eight and it was close to 8:30, so I said I would come back another day.  Next thing I knew, she was letting me in and asking me what I would like to order.  I told her I had wanted to try the goat dish, Birria I think it's called.  So they started preparing it for me (to go).  I looked around while waiting and discovered they also have Thrifty Ice Cream, paletas, various Mexican desserts including strawberries and cream, flan, etc, also Aguas Frescas made with real fruit.  I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in Az because it is plentiful in San Diego, but I WILL be back to this place, only a few blocks from where I'm staying.    The food was delicious.  But the customer service is even better!

Don't throw away those coupons!  They never expire in spite of the date it says they do.    This is now my closest location and I have found they carry a lot of things that cheaper stores don't, gadgets, better appliances and cookware.  I have found the sales assistants to be very available and helpful.  I get asked if I need help and  finding what I'm looking for at least three times per visit.  They offer to look things up online if it isn't in the store and help you order it if needed.    They keep a lot of little stuff near the front but if you dawdle looking at it they invariably ask you if you are ready to check out even though you are obviously still looking.  Happens every time.  If you are looking for a higher priced item you can really save using the 20% off coupon.  They are available by text also if you don't get them in the mail.  And you can use the coupon even on a sale item which saves you even ore.

Cute little store with fun merchandise, kind of pricey.  I always find something to buy here, usually nail polish or hair and nail accessories.  I went in today on a fast trip before a movie to see if they had any Xmas nail decals.  They didn't but I ended up with some pretty nail art stencils, a silver nail art pen, and a magnetic necklace.  They always have something on sale, too.  It's one store I'll always pop into when I'm in the mall.  The clerks are nice and helpful here, too.

If you like Filipino food you should try this place.  I ate here several times while I was in Chandler. There are so many dishes that are good here and I don't even know the names of most of them.  What I did, once I saw how it was, was to go in after 6pm when they put almost everything on half price to move it out before they close and I just pointed to about 4 or 5 dishes like I was going thru a buffet line and get the smallest container of each item (except the pancit which I really love and get a bigger size of) and took it all home and eat it for the next 3 or 4 meals.  The chicken and pork were both good.  This is not low-calorie stuff so be forewarned it will fill you up!

This place has the personal touch I like.  The guy remembered me from 2007 and 8/08.  Unfortunately they didn't have Pancit today but I got some sinigang and ate it on the spot. (4/16/09)

Bookman's is a great place.  What DON'T they carry??  Books magazines, DVDs, gift items, a smattering of jewelry, even knitting needles and rubber stamps!  It's not an impersonal chain, to my knowledge at least, and the employees are helpful.  Everything is pretty well organized by genre.  They even have coffee and sandwiches, and they are very good. .I always find some gem or another in here.  Most of their prices are pretty good, tho some things are more than I personally want to pay.  Overall it's an A+ store that I wish was near where I live.  I always enjoy coming in here when I'm in town.

Not bad for a fast food experience.  The place was dead empty when we went in with two tired toddlers about 7 on a Sunday night. The employees were friendly and helpful, the food was acceptable for what it was, it was a pretty good value pricewise. The kids were pretty good and scarfed down their food and we all enjoyed our tiny Frosties, which have gotten even tinier over the years but still just the right amount.  Everything looked pretty clean, at least before we hit.  I'd go back, and I don't say that about too many fast food places.

I don't know why the other reviewer only gave this place one star after basically saying she likes it.  Today was the second time I've been here and both times it was perfectly good.  I've had good food and good service, the tables are clean, the atmosphere is very interesting with old photos of actors all over the walls.  The pictures are not "random" but follow an old movies theme.    I don't remember what I had before (last summer) and don't see a picture on file so I probably forgot to take one.  I think I had fried chicken.  Whatever it was it was good, I remember that.  Today I got a lunch special of ham salad sandwich, something you don't find most places, with soup and coleslaw. The split pea soup was wonderful, not too salty like many places, so thick you could eat it with a fork, and full of chunks of ham.  The ham salad was meaty and tender with just the right amount of mayo.  The coleslaw had good flavor, too.    The waitress was attentive and I picked up a real atmosphere of cheerfulness and comradery listening to the waitresses and cooks talking with each other.  I didn't feel rushed either and was able to post my pics and write this review after finishing my lunch.  Now that they are open later (winters hours) I will try and get back before I leave town.  12/17/10 Mini-update: I finally remembered it was catfish I had my first time here and it was very good.  My most recent visit I had a dinner special (they always have several) of chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and gravy, green beans and Veggie cabbage soup.  All were very good.  Their soups are homemade and you can tell by the rich broth.    One con:  I tried to come here a couple of nights ago and even though I was told they are open till 8:30pm in the winter, backed up by the sign outside, at 8:05pm they were closed with the door locked.  Me disappointed.  Especially since the first place I tried to go to was out of business, as was the place I tried after this one and I was on my fourth restaurant before I found a place to eat.

I went to this place within days of hearing about it from an in-law who had just started working there and we just loved it--so much that I went back there with my brother when he came to town (he liked it too) and with my picky daughter who is, unlike her mother, hesitant to try new and exotic foods, and anybody else I could get to go there with me.  They even gave me the "family discount" without my even asking for one and let my relative take time to sit down and chat with us when she had a chance.  The owners treated us like we were THEIR family. And they brought over some unsolicited complimentary appetizers just so we could try more things!  My daughter loved the Anise Pho Beef Soup so much she got it both times.  My mother had the veggie crepe and it was more than she could eat.  In fact we had so many leftovers we made an entire meal out of them the next day!    I can't wait to return to Chandler and go to this place again.

This is one of my favorite places in Chandler and I try to get by here whenever I'm in town.  The people who run it are so nice and the atmosphere is very relaxed.  The prices are a little higher than other Vietnamese places I go but not prohibitive.  Everything I've had here over the past two years has been delicious.   (4/09)

This store is much bigger than many of the Dollar Trees I've been to and they had just about everything I needed in one stop, one CHEAP stop, less than $18 for everything I got.  I just needed a few things while visiting the area that I forgot to bring with me.  Dollar Trees across the country have rescued me more than once in the years since I first started shopping in them.  The condition of the store was pretty good considering it was late afternoon, and the clerk was most cheerful.  I would not hesitate to shop here again.  I understand how irritating rude and inconsiderate customers can be but always hate to see the store get blamed and receive a bad review based on a bad experience with a fellow customer rather than due to a bad experience with the store itself.

I took my less adventurous daughter here one evening because I personally love fondue ever since I first had it in Switzerland.  She said she wasn't that hungry and didn't want "the works" so we just got the Swiss cheese fondue and the dessert fondue.  It was more than enough--we had to take some of the chocolate home to finish later!  Both were as delicious as I hoped and the service was very good.  We sat at a counter rather than a table but that's fun to do once in awhile.  I have no complaints.  We intended to come back here before I returned to San Diego but there were so many fun little restaurants to try that we just never made it back.  Maybe next trip!

Great customer service!  The one on Baseline didn't have any lines open at about this same time of night last week so I did my shopping, then had to ring my own items up and bag my own stuff.  Seemed to me they should be paying me to do their work.  But at this store, there was a line open with a very nice young man working .  I complimented the store on having better service, then had to question the price of some TP I was buying which came up at twice the price of the sign on the shelf under the packages, so I asked him to take it off unless they had someone who could walk over with me and show me which package was $6.99 (said nicely) and next thing I knew he tossed the TP in my basket at no charge.  That's exactly the sort of PR that makes you want to return to a store. Plus their prices were good on the items I bought and they also have a great clearance section.

Tina makes you feel like a member of her family the first time you go there.  I regret I didn't go there sooner but didn't know anyone in the area to go with and was inhibited to go by myself--boy was I wrong!  She made me feel right at home, came over to talk with me every chance she got, and mother-henned me till I left even though I'm older than her!  She was supposed to close about 10 but we hung out talking and watching TV till about 11:30pm!  Such a delightful person--a real asset to Chandler.    The food is delicious--very flavorful without being too spicy for the average person.  If you're vegetarian there are plenty of veggie dishes to fill you up. I loved that I had leftovers to take home and enjoy the next day.    I forgot to mention this is often a one-woman show. Tina is the hostess who welcomes you, the waitress who takes your order, the cook and busboy.  I don't know how she does it all but she does!    The injera bread and Ethiopian tea are both delicious, by the way.  I'm back in San Diego now but hope to see her on my next trip to Chandler.

I tried three different times to go to Tina's--something I had really looked forward to when I returned to Chandler--but found the place closed all three times.  This was a new location across the street from the original one and looked totally different inside when I looked thru the window.  Finally, on the third try on my last day in  town, I went into the bar next door to ask the lady bartender if she had any info.  To my great disappointment she said it was closed for good.  What a shame!  Tina--If you're out there and read this get in touch with me and let me know if you ever re-open!

I only went in here once out of curiosity.  I'm mad at them for two reasons.  First, when my cousins the Knox's sold their property here where they lived when they were first married, it was under a stipulation the little house on the property not be torn down.  One day they got a call from friends who told them their house was being demolished and they didn't even have the chance to go take a few last pictures.  I used to always take a turn past that house when there on visits because on my first few trips to Chandler when I was in college, this is where I stayed.  Now it's the Dollar General--which turned out isn't even a true Dollar store (see explanation below)..  Second, to me a dollar store is a place where everything should be a dollar--hence the name!  I got a bag of BBQ chips and didn't realize till I got home they charged me $3 for.  I wouldn't have bought them if I'd known that.  I intended to take them back and complain since they weren't marked so it was like I got tricked but I just never got back there.  When my brother came to town we just ate them.  I also never went back there so they lost business from me.  I love dollar stores and went to the 99 Cent Only Store in Chandler weekly--because I knew everything was 99 cents!

This place was surprisingly very good!  I went in with negative expectations, but the chicken was crisp outside, not overly salty, plump and dripping with juices on the inside.  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh with a good balance of ingredients, the biscuits were crutchy on the outside and moist as white cake on the inside.  The service was cheerful, friendly and helpful.  I have no complaints.

I never noticed this place when I was here in Chandler for 9 months in 2007, but the lady said they had been here for 5 years.  My loss.     Today I was driving through the center it is in and noticed it had Filipino food, which I have come to appreciate in San Diego recently.  I used the "point-point" method along with a few questions and ended up with my standby, Pork Sinigang, which was good, a pork snout mixture, and some rice.  The rice was mediocre but the other dishes were very good and I was glad I stopped here, even though it meant I didn't get as far as the places in Chandler I was anxious to get back to.  I now have a new favorite in town!  The combination I got was $6.50 and was way more food than I could eat in one sitting.  I will be back! (4/09)

From the San Diego Talk Thread, "Sinigang Soup for the Soul":  "Okay, so  yesterday (6/3) I gave in to the swollen gums, right cheek, eye and right side of my lips and went to my cousin's highly recommended dentist in Chandler (AZ) and ended up with an emergency double-root-canal on two side-by-side molars that had cracked back in January and I hadn't taken care of.  So where did I go after filling my prescription at the local Costco Pharmacy?  Jeepney Bistro, a local Point-Point place I found here two trips ago.  Had a bowl of Sinigang and a plate of Bihon.  I left feeling like I'd had a good day in spite of the dental trauma.  Who needs chicken soup??  http://www.jeepneybist...  http://www.yelp.com/bi...  I guess I just wrote my update, huh?"

There was a time would I would've given this place a higher rating but now it's the dirtiest most disorganized, not to mention overpriced store in the area. They won't even sell you something if it doesn't have a price tag on it so why do they put it out if it doesn't have a price tag? When I think about the things I have bypassed and not bought because the price was so high, they have have possibly lost $100 or so.   Today in particular I passed on many things including Halloween costumes that have not been marked down even though its two weeks past Halloween. And there was a cute little baby hat with matching booties that I might have bought to donate with the blankets I make except it was marked $6.98! Come on people, you got it for free. On top of that I've got a runny nose from sneezing from all the dust I breathed in while I was there. I actually had a layer of dust and hairs sticking to my cell phone screen just from walking around and holding the few things I was going to buy.   If you like thrift stores I recommend the local Savers stores, the local Goodwill stores and the Deseret store just down the street. Deseret in particular is immaculately clean, incredibly organized, extremely reasonable, with much friendlier clerks and I don't sneeze or feel dirty when I leave there.  In fact I left here and went straight to Deseret to get rid of the dirty feeling.  Ugh.  My last trip here I came across three items I was interested in that hadn't been priced.  One was just a wooden spoon, one was a package of painting sponges with a new price printed on of 59¢. I don't remember the other but it was something really inconsequential.  All together they were worth about a dollar.  But no, they were so TERRIBLY valuable that I had surely taken the tags off to get a "deal", huh? They wouldn't sell any of them.  None was anything I needed, it just irritated me.  They should be trying to get rid of the stuff to make room for more, not selling something for $6.98 that the other stores would sell for 99¢!

Sometimes you just need a cheap place to sleep.    If too many people were converging on my parents' house they would get overwhelmed in their older years and ask if we could all get motels instead of staying with them, reducing extra work and stress for my mother.  I prefer little 1950's style motels but husband is a big fan of Motel 6's and I can't argue with the price.  Plus they used to give a AAA discount and still give you 10% off with an AARP card, which he had.  And kids stay free, which we also had.  One AARP card, one kid.  That's us.  So the AARP discount kind of wiped out the taxes and we end up paying whatever it says on the marquee.  Quarters were a bit cramped for the three of us and there was sometimes competition for the bathroom but we managed and saved money and spent all but the sleeping and getting ready time at my folks so we didn't need the room for kicking back or anything, didn't need shampoos or frig or microwave, just clean beds and bathroom.  That they had.

I am NOT having good luck with my cheapie motels this trip.  First I get a room at the Chandler Inn, which I have successfully stayed at before, that had hairs in the bathtub, a broken bed frame, and dirty female underwear stashed in the bathroom sink cabinet, then I check into the Motel 6 in Mesa that I have stayed at previously (though years ago) and the first room they assign me to has all the lights on, totally disheveled, unmade beds, trash in the wastebaskets, etc, obviously not cleaned since the previous occupants, and the room they re-assign me to has hairs all over the hardwood floors throughout, tiny hairs in and around the sink and even a few on the sheets,  though they do look washed.    You should not put hardwood floors in a motel room if you are not going to clean them properly.    And what's up with all the TV remotes everywhere I go being sticky, greasy and dusty?  They should include a wipedown with a sanitizing wipe in their daily cleanup.    On top of that the room above me sounds like it has hardwood floors as well with a family of kids running back and forth on them (I got here at 10:30pm and it's nearly midnight now).  It's a non-smoking room but still smells like smoke as if it is coming in from other rooms through the ventilation system.  I will not be staying here another night.  The only good thing was the front desk clerk was very nice.  Is it that hard to find good housekeeping employees these days?  With all the unemployment you'd think they could find better. (5/1/09)

I'm dropping the stars from 3 to 2.  My daughter ate here again while I tried out the new Sushi place where Julie's Chicken and Waffles sadly went out (already!).  I tasted her Orange Chicken, which I get nearly every time I go to the Panda Express near my home, and it just wasn't good.  She said she just wasn't going to eat there again since she wasn't happy with the last meal either. It either sat too long or cooked too long.  The Orange Chicken was dry and chewy and just not fresh and crisp like I know it should be.  Shame on you Panda Express!  For ruining something that your chain usually makes so well!  I'm not making it one star because the rice and Crab Won Tons were still decent.

Because I was used to shopping at the BevMo in La Mesa, when I found myself suddenly in Arizona, I located this store in the Yellow Pages and made the trek out there on a run to the Michael's and Joann's in the same area (about a 15-20 minute drive from the house).  I found the clerks here to be almost as cheerful and friendly and helpful as my guys in La Mesa.  I do have to keep my loyalties to home base though.  This store had the items I was used to buying in San Diego which was very convenient, I just had to stock up a little more because it wasn't 5 minutes away like my home store.  The guys here always commented on my little key chain BevMo card because they don't have those here.  They usually knew I was from Cali before I even pulled out my ID because of that.  After a few trips they even started remembering me and saying hi when I walked in--one of the things I like about my home store, too.  Whatever they do to train these guys they do it right.  That's not to say some of the clerks just aren't naturally friendly people, but BevMo does seem to attract more than their share of great employees.  I hope that never changes.

I discovered this wonderful CHEAP theater last summer while watching over my mother's house in Chandler and once I found it I went to see movies almost weekly..  How can you pass up $2 movies that just left the $10 theaters and $3.50 popcorn tubs that include a refill!  Only problem I had with the popcorn was sometimes they had already closed up the concession counter by the time I came out of a late movie so I couldn't get a refill to take home and munch on the next night or two.  I saw so many movies that I'm sure I wouldn't  have seen if this place hadn't been there.  Later I discovered a theater even closer in Chandler that I started going to but still came back to this one occasionally.  If only we had a theater like this in San Diego I'd go to the movies more often!

Note that most of the reviews for this place are 4 and 5 stars.  The only one-star review is from a person who objects to it on principle--that they are allegedly letting in  kids who should be in school.  This is a great theater to go to for recent movies ( just past first-run) without breaking the bank.  I'm just not going to pay $10.50 for a movie and $7 for the refillable popcorn in San Diego.  I was in Chandler for a week's visit and was very happy to come back here and pay $3 for the movie and $4.25 for the large popcorn with refill.  I saw The new Indiana Jones movie, which has just left the expensive theaters.  It was fun but I'm glad I didn't have to pay top price to see it.  This way I could enjoy it.  Doing a great job people!  Why don't you come take over a theater in San Diego and run it like this!

Well, this is the third time I've been to the Arizona State Fair. The first time was 3 years ago when my grandson was a baby in a stroller and the first thing I noticed was how much smaller it was compared to what I'm used to at the fair in San Diego. There aren't nearly as many vendors or food booths but I did enjoy walking around and looking at everything.  I went with my daughter and her friend and I watched the baby while they went to a concert in the evening.  The admission price is much more reasonable at this fair than the the one in San Diego and the senior price is even better.   The next time I went was last year. My granddaughter was a baby in a stroller and the grandson was two.  I went with my two youngest daughters on the weekend when the price was only $2 if you got there before 2 o'clock . Because we had the kids I decided to go ahead and pay the $10 to park in the inside lot near to the entrance and I was glad we did. We didn't spend too much on food because we did a lot of splitting and we did stay until the concert started and I got to see the band Weezer. It was very loud so I held my hands over the baby's ears the whole time but I have to admit I did enjoy the music . I'm embarrassed to say that that was probably my first rock concert, so the baby,  the toddler and I all went to our first rock concert together.     Last year we kind of discovered by accident a toddler and child play area that my grandson just loved and we let him work out some of his energy on all the baby safe equipment that they had there since he'd spent a long time just sitting in the stroller as we walked around. I had taken the baby sling that I used for my now 23 year old and loved so much I never did get rid of it, and carried the baby around in that most of the day, very comfortably I might add. There was a vendor there selling an item that look like an oversized backpack on wheels called the Shopping Jeep that I bought for $20 and I have used the heck out of that thing ever since I bought it. It's not the highest quality item I ever bought and I've had to mend it where a seam ripped but I still got a lot of good use out of it.    This year we didn't go to any concerts.  The kids were 1 and 3 and my daughter is expecting again so we didn't want to overdo, but somehow we ended up being there from 1:30 pm to 10 p.m. I don't know how we spent that much time there but we were busy the whole time. My daughter thinks we spent over an hour just in the play area which is possible because both of the kids were enjoying it so much . Again we got there before 2 on a Sunday so we only had to pay $2 each for the grown ups and the kids were free so we splurged and paid the $10 to park inside. To my surprise there was a lot on the outside charging $20 for parking! That didn't make any sense at all to me. My daughter was bemoaning the fact that she couldn't go bungee jumping but I told her she shouldn't be doing that anyway now that she's a mother. All in all we had a fun day but came home very tired.  Like all fairs the food and rides are expensive but we split food and don't go on rides.  A turkey leg with no sides was $11.25 but it had enough meat for both of us and bites for the kids.  We got a small funnel cake for $4.50 and shared it.  She brought snacks and drinks for the kids and they ate them all.    The kids really enjoyed the animals but the only petting area we saw charged to get in so we were content to look through the pens.  I always enjoy watching the vendors do their demos and we stopped to listen to a singer for a few minutes.  We spent quite awhile walking through the Ice Age display with moving animals.  Last year it was an insect display.    Bathrooms were plentiful and adequately kept up.  Would I recommend the fair to others? Yes! It is a great family activity.

Dangerous place to shop!  Lots of neat imported goodies, many in sample sizes so you can try them out before buying the bigger size.  I got about 6 different flavors of hot cocoa, a maple sugar candy in a maple leaf shape for me (Michigan thing), and filed away a lot of ideas for gift-buying when I get home.  I might even ask Santa for a gift card to World Market for myself!

Beautiful stuff in here, less little miscellaneous items than its next door neighbor, World Market, more furniture and housewares.  If I don't get in here very often, Xmas is the time to come.  I was just going to look around but ended up buying several of their fragrance beads on sale, and a  couple of small versions of the infusion incense sticks in peppermint and gingerbread.  Some will be gifts and a couple for me.  That's how I shop.

Update 3/26/08--I just found out from my daughter that the admission price is now only $1.00!!  I'm giving this 5 stars just because if they hadn't been there I wouldn't have gotten to see all the movies I did last summer.  It was only $3 to get in  and not much more for a big tub of Popcorn that came with a refill.  The popcorn didn't have quite as good of flavor as the Pollack Tempe Theater but was still worth it.  Bottom line, my daughter and and I could go to the movies for about  $10 including the popcorn--for both of us!  No it's not deluxe but I'm paying for the fun of seeing the movie, not plush surroundings.  And the clerks are friendly and start to remember you if you go there a few times.  I like when people know me and make me feel welcome.

Terrible tragedy--they raised their price from $1 to $2!  Oh no!  Hahaha!  I found out this great theater is under new management since January.  They sound like neat people and I was so glad to see the place still open 'cause I had heard it closed.  Fortunately I don't believe everything I hear so the first night I was in town (7/19) I stopped by about 10:30pm to find a line of fascinating characters out front waiting for the weekly showing of Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Not my cup of tea but if it helps keep the place afloat more power to them!  I came back on Monday to see Nim's Island for $2 admission and $3.50 for large popcorn WITH refill.   Sure wish we had a theater like this in San Diego!  I will definitely stop in next trip, too!  Keep up the good work guys!  Oh yeah the increase in admission is to cover the extra cost of A/C in the summer since it is over 100 degrees outside!

I was so disappointed when I arrived in December and found that this theater had closed for good.  Whe I stopped by the location I found that a school of performing arts had taken over the site--a perfect match I'm sure and better than having it razed, but still a disapointment to not be able to go here any more.    BTW---if anyone knows where the former owners or an employee named "Bryan" or maybe "Ryan" is, contact me, or have them contact me via Yelp or give you their info to pass on to me please.  I promised the kid some pics from my yearbook of one of his favorite actors that I went to college with.   I didn't know he wouldn't be available when I came back and I have been bringing the album with me to photocopy if I should locate him for my last two trips here.  Thanks!.

I've been here half a dozen times in the past couple of years and it is on my list of definitely places to eat when I visit Chandler.  I've never been to the bar so I can't say anything about their drinks but the food I had was mostly good.    The first time I was here I just went in to check it out and see what they had on their menu but it was Thursday night and they had their Lamb special so I decided to stay and eat.  It is really unusual for me to spend over $30 on just me by myself but I really splurged that time.  I got the Scotch Eggs Appetizer (I hadn't had a Scotch Egg since I was in England in 1969!), the lamb dinner, a dark ale to drink, and a Trifle for desert.  The eggs were cold and not bad but not as delicious as what I remembered.  The lamb was wonderful and included some Yorkshire pudding all puffed up like a gigantic mountain of puff pastry.  The ale was excellent.  The Trifle was $6.50 but huge enough to feed four people so I took a large portion of it home.  In fact my to-go box had some of each item except the ale to eat over the next couple of days.  I was very happy with my experience overall.  The next time I went I got the Bangers and  mash and they were absolutely delicious!  I'm blanking on what else I tried except for an apple pie with the traditional custard sauce when I went there with my middle daughter and it was also very good.  If you like British style food you should try it.  They have other foods too.  I was sorry to see the other place this used to be close ( Don & Charlie"s?) but if they hadn't this place wouldn''t have had the opportunity to open here and I'm glad they did!

Well, I know I reviewed this place last year when I first started yelping so I don't know what happened to my review but I stopped in there shortly before leaving t town and just had a drink because I had already eaten but the place smelled wonderful.  I Got back to town in April of this year and stopped in here while I was in the area.  It was no disappointment.  The food was good and the service was better!  This is now on my "things to do in Chandler" list for future trips!

I slipped into the parking lot to take a picture of Floridino's to put with my Yelp review and screeched to a halt when I saw this scrapbooking store--new since I was here last September.  What  beautiful,  well-lit, clean, appealing store!  I bought a couple of items and was glad to see that Chandler now had another scrapbooking store to make up for losing Recollections.  Now I will combine this with a trip to my favorite rubber stamp store--Stampworks!--whenever I am in town!

This just opened last summer and boy was I glad to see it--fast, inexpensive, good food, VERY friendly owners/clerks, even gave me a comp spanakopita to try to get me "hooked"!  I would eat here all the time if I lived in town.

I didn't have much luck here--could never find a clerk available to help me.   I did see some female employees chit-chatting among themselves behind the customer service counter while I waited for their attention and passed by one old fart talking on his cell phone while I stood there waiting to ask a question.  When I turned around and walked away he called after me "Can I help you with something?" but I figured if he could ignore me then I might as well ignore him.  I left without buying and took my business to the Home Depot down the street.

Yesterday was the second time my daughter and I came here with the kids after going to the Mesa Youth Museum for their free admission Sunday. Both times were a big success. If you have kids,  this is the place to go. Not only do they have kid-friendly foods, but they have an amazingly kid-friendly atmosphere. If your little ones get a little rambunctious or fussy, you'll find no dirty looks here. They couldn't be more friendly and welcoming to your family. The owners are very friendly, too. After we were done eating the first time we went there, a month ago, we sat around swapping family stories.   We got the two slice special with drinks for $5.99 the first time we went there. The first time it was good, but yesterday it was hot out of the oven and really, really delicious, moist and chewy and cheesy. Last time we got an order of Popcorn Chicken,  $1.99, for the toddler and he had to fight us off for  bites if it,  it was so good! This time we were told they no longer carry those so we got a $2.99 order of Chicken Tenders, three in the basket. They were okay and again he loved  them. Last time we got two scoops of their delicious ice cream to  share, and this time we got the Cannilonis which were delicious. If you have  just been to the Mesa Youth Museum they give you 10-20% off your meal, can't remember which.   I think we may have started a family tradition, Youth Museum on their free Sunday, then Queens Pizza for dinner!

The tires on my nearly new van were getting low and I had no problem taking it in here to have them checked and filled even though the tires didn't come from them.  Then, when I was getting ready to drive home to San Diego with a van full of stuff making it extra heavy, I stopped by here on the way out of town and they very nicely checked all my tires again to make sure everything was at the right pressure before the long drive, making me feel much more confident when I set out.  They fix flats for free if they're fixable even it the tires didn't come from them, too!  Great place!

I have GOT to stop judging places by the fact that they are a chain.  I have never been here on my numerous trips to Mesa and to Riverview Shopping Center because I assumed I wouldn't like it.  But I've been craving Chicken and Dumplings lately and found out they had it so I decided to try them out.    First, the service was cheerful and attentive without hovering.  Second, the price was right: $7.99 with two sides, a corn muffin and a biscuit.  The amount of food was about perfect, maybe a bit more than I needed but not quite enough to justify a to go box.  If the chicken had been any more tender I wouldn't have been able to discern it from the noodles.  The dumplings were the thick noodle style, not like my mother's which were balls of biscuit dough dropped into boiling broth, but they tasted good so that was ok.  The green beans were as good as any my mother made, mushy Indiana style with lots of bacon flavor.  Mmmm.  The baked sweet potato was very mushy with a perfectly edible skin.  I ate every bite even though I was expecting it to be the texture of a regular baked potato.    I'm not a big cornbread fan but theirs was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with good flavor.  I like that they give you one smaller corn muffin and one smaller biscuit for variety.  I've lost count of the number of times I've eaten a biscuit that has sat around too long, or the dough has, and it tastes fermented/moldy, like beans or split pea soup that has sat out too long.  This one was super fresh and had great texture and flavor.    So the entire meal was a success! St. Patrick's Day is later in the week so I'll have to come back abd try their Corned Beef and Cabbage Special for $8.99.

4/22/09  My daughter suggested we ago here after we tossed around a few suggestions.   It turned out they were having their "2-for $13.99" special and it was Happy Hour to boot--killer!  She got the Salmon and I got the 6 oz sirloin.  Both were delicious, though her salmon wasn't as moist as some I've had.  My skewered grilled veggies were wonderful, The "Brewskie onions" were disappointing, though they gave me a lot for 99 cents.  The mac and cheese was very good hot but got kind of gummy as it cooled off.  We got the 3 for $5 mini desserts which were all from heaven, gooey and rich and sweet and just the right amount to enjoy without OD-ing on the richness.  Oh and TWO margueritas for $4.50!  Wow.  Good ones, too.  We left happy and not broke.

I've eaten here twice this trip and just love it!  I had the Goat Curry the first time and Pork Jerk Dinner the second time. Both were huge and delicious!  I'll add more when I get back to San Diego with my own internet (I'm at the Chandler Library) but just wanted to get my 2-bits in for now.

I saw the sign from the street the first day or two I was in town and vowed to try to get there while I was here.   My last day here, 7/24,  I made it in for lunch.  What a great place!  The girl said they just opened 2 weeks ago and yet the place had people coming in it the whole time I was there and several of them acted like they were already "regulars"!  Way to catch on!    There were three ladies who were obviously on their lunch break from work in front of me in the line and I was listening in on their conversation and finally asked them a couple of questions about items on the menu.  I got a half-order of Curried Goat.  Now where else you gonna find Curried Goat on a menu?!  It was delicious and amazingly tender!  Cost--$5.  I also got a meat pie that I didn't eat till that evening (kept it in a baggie in my cooler) and a cookie/pie kind of thing that I nibbled on later also.  I heard their chicken jerk is really good.    Man, why did I not get in here till my last day in Chandler! Finding this place almost made up for learning Tina's Ethiopian cafe had closed!  Now it is on my list of places to be sure to hit on the next trip so all you Yelpers get out there and patronize it and keep it in business till I get back!  You won't be sorry!

Yummy, yummy, yummy,  Chicken Jerk in my tummy,  Goat Curry is in it too. The Brown Stew Chicken was  Really finger lickin' The Oxtail was tender all through. Chicken Patty turnover was  A very good choice, Red Velvet Cake so delicious and moist, Sweet potato pie was fruity and sweet; Glad I got to Chander to revisit this treat!  (Hot Pot 4/18/09 Sat.)

Yup, I got back here last trip and this one.  Last time I got the Oxtail meal--oh my, so good, and rich in flavor!  And tender!  Fall-off-the-bone-tender.  Melt-in-your-mouth-tender.  I'm drooling just remembering it.  In fact, much as I loved the Goat Curry, I got the Oxtail this trip, too, and it was as good as I remembered.  My daughter's dog will love me forever for bringing her the bones, also.    So, when are you going to open up a place in San Diego?

I stopped in here on impulse en route to Hobby Lobby and upon seeing it was 5:30 I realized I was in time for the early bird specials for $8.99.  I ordered the six-oz Sirloin with two sides.  This time I was aware in advance that when they ask you if you want toppings it costs extra even though they don't tell you about it.  The green beans were probably saltier than is healthy and cooked in the "mushy" style, which I like fine, and had lots of good bacon pieces and flavor.  The Caesar salad couldn't have been much better, cold, crisp and crunchy with just the right amount of good dressing. The rolls are delicious but awfully sweet to blend with the meal, more like a dessert unto themselves, especially with the cinnamon butter.    I was impressed with the steak which was so thick it was almost an ovoid.  It was cooked more rare than medium rare but I like that fine, too.  The impressive part was how nicely the knife cut through it and how easy it was to chew.  I've gotten steaks twice in the last few months from Outback for a couple dollars more that were so tough you couldn't stab it with a fork, had to be a lumberjack to saw through it and it chewed like your grandmother's old shoe leather.   It was a real treat to eat this one and have it be the way a good steak should be.    I would come back easily, and hope I will sometime.  My only objection is that they constantly try to upsell you to drinks, appetizers, toppings, etc.  The waiter was very nice and efficient, I just don't want the times I have to say No, thank you to outnumber the times I say Yes, please.  It sets a tone of negativity in its own way.

In this area of the Phoenix suburbs I have been to four city branch libraries--downtown Chandler, both Mesa libraries and the Tempe library. While my favorite has to be the Chandler library which I visited weekly for several months when I was here helping my mother out in 2007, I would say the Tempe library is a close second favorite. It has a really nice welcoming atmosphere as soon as you walk in. There is a dais as you enter were there are usually one or two employees waiting to answer any questions you might have, which is very handy and helpful.  They have a pretty decent selection of audio books for being a one branch library.  The upstairs seems to be mainly adult items and if you go down the stairs you'll find the teen section, middle school section, Elementary and preschool sections, also a conference room on the downstairs level.  I couldn't figure out where the elevator was but they do have an elevator if the stairs are a problem.   There are several computers where you can check books out and catalog computers where you can look up books are stationed throughout the library.  Off to the back right as you walk in there is a little lunch counter with coffee, drinks, sandwiches, desserts, pastries, etc.  I tried a red velvet cupcake and it was very good.  If you're in a hurry there is a drive thru book drop on one side of the building which I used several times.  Parking is more than plentiful and I always see lots of cars there and lots of people using the library-- always a good sign.  I can't survive with out my audio books to listen to wherever I am and this library supplied me with probably close to 20 while I was in town (thanks to my daughter's library card).  I shall return next trip!

This was the third place I attempted to go to for dinner last night.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer. I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next. I snoozed, I loozed.   The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a few minutes after 8.  The third place, here, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business. FML.  I finally ended up at Yogi's Grill, also in Riverview Center.   Thank goodness they were open!  I have no idea when this placed closed or why, since their reviews were so good.

I meant go be going to the other Pho place on Southern but I overshot and missed it and found myself here instead, so I figured, what the heck.  It looks like maybe a former Taco Bell building.  As soon as I walked in I was enveloped by wonderful aromas of pho broth but in the AZ hot weather I opted for a cooler dish, the #45, Vermicelli with Charbroiled Shrimp and BBQ Pork.  It wasn't a large amount of food but it was delicious.  I ate it all, no leftovers.  Just about everything on the menu was between $6.25 to $6.75.  Can't get much more reasonably priced than that.  There are mostly Asian people in here, always a good sign the food is authentic.  The servers were very nice.  I hope I get back here to try another meal before I have to leave town.

I'd been down with a flu bug or something for about a day and a half and had a very delicate tummy. I got out the door so I could go to the Rubber Stamp Show they have here in Mesa twice a year and when the show was over I figured I should get something to eat since I hadn't had anything for 2 days. I searched Yelp for a Jewish delicatessen thinking chicken soup would be the best thing but there wasn't anything close.   I tried searching different categories including soup and wasn't satisfied with what I saw. Then I thought, well what the heck, and started searching for pho places. I think this is one of the places that popped up and since it was a place that I had passed by many times and wanted to try, I decided to stop in here.   I told the young man behind the counter that I was interested in soup but I wasn't sure if the choices listed on the menu would be enough food for me and he let me know they have the larger 32 ounce size available so I said that's the ticket and ordered the egg drop soup, after debating between it and the won ton soup.    The soup came out fairly quickly and while it was piping hot it was edible pretty quickly.  It had good flavor and lots of good egg in it which I figured would give me some nutrition and protein.  It wasn't overly salty like so many soups are and I had absolutely no tummy reactions to it later, for which I was very grateful. I felt much better by the time I left and I think it helped me get back on my feet the next day .   I found the atmosphere to be very friendly and welcoming and the soup to be good quality.  I will definitely be coming back here to try other items that looked good on the menu. Oh, and did I mention the soup was only about five dollars? Score.

Not too happy with this Walmart.  I had a measly $4 vinyl tablecloth I bought in aqua at the one in San Diego because they didn't have anything in lavender, then later found one at a thrift store in a pretty purple flowered material so I wanted to return the aqua one.  I didn't worry about bringing a receipt for a $4 item and had just bought it less than a month ago but they told me they would only give me $2 back on it!!  It's not the money, it's the rip off.  I had never even taken it out of the package!  Now I have to wait till I get back to San Diego, find the receipt, which I'm sure I have, then take it back again.  What a pain.  On the good side, I found a clerk who was very helpful, pointing me to all the different areas to find the items I wanted to buy for my daughter's apartment.  She saved me a lot of walking, which I appreciated.

My daughter and her boyfriend had spotted a "Grand Opening" sign on this little restaurant in a local strip mall recently and wanted to try it so all three of us went here on Monday April 18.  Wow--great place!  The server couldn't have been sweeter, more informative or more attentive.  They have all the usual dishes, plus more unusual ones like Alligator, Snails, Anti-oxident drinks.    I ordered the Quail, fried (or you can get it rotisserie-style), daughter got a chicken dish and shared her delicious rice with me (mine only came with accompanying greens but no noodles or rice), her boyfriend got a combination Pho soup that included pork, liver, quail egg, squid, crab, shrimp, rice noodles and we shared some crispy egg rolls for a starter.  Everything was top quality and fresh and very reasonably priced (about $6-8 ea).  We were very happy we went here and the server gave us a coupon for 10% off our next visit.    I will definitely put this one on my go-to list for future trips.

I found out about this place te last time I was in the Mesa AZ area over Christmas but didn't make it here, so I made sure to get in here this trip.  I had a hard time deciding what to get becasue it all looked so exotic and interesting. I ended up getting a #24 SANDWICH CUBANO (Slowly roasted pork, ham slices, Swiss cheese, pickle chips, and mustard, pressed and toasted  $8.95) with a side of  fried yucca wedges (included).  It was delicious.    I still don't know what fried Yucca is but they were so good I ate them all and was only able to finish half my sandwich.  I saved the rest till the next day for lunch and it was excellent then, too.  The meat could have been a little more tender, as I love me some tender pork, but the flavor was so good it made up for that.  Now I want to go back and maybe just get a bowl of the soup--(#13 POTAJE DE GARBANZOS Garbanzo beans simmered to perfection with our special seasonings, pork, potatoes, and Spanish chorizo. Served with rice. Cup  $3.75     Bowl  $4.99) so I will have room to enjoy some dessert (DULCE DE LECHE Traditional Cuban-style milk dessert slowly simmered with vanilla, cinnamon, and lime  $4.25)     The service was excellent also, even though the waitress said she had just started and had to ask the owner a couple of questions to be able to answer mine.  No less than three different people stopped by my table (and others) to see if everything was okay and if I needed anything.  Way to go!

I have one word for you, son.  Porkbellies.  Specifically, GRILLED Porkbellies.  With a side of rice, a side of pickled eggplant, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of cucumbers.  It doesn't get much better than this.  (crunch, crunch, crunch)

I'm totally shocked to find I never reviewed this store! As many times as I came in here the nine months I lived in my mother's house in Chandler in 2007?? I have bought so much stuff in here over the past seven years I have probably paid a year's rent for them.  I do believe their prices have gone up and sometimes border on the ridiculous but if you go on the 50% off days you can do really well.  Their stuff is in good condition and well organized.  I keep coming back every time I'm in town!

Taking back all my stars except the one I can't take out.  First of all I might have spent over a hundred dollars if their prices weren't so high. Instead I only spent $25 and even that seemed high for the little dab I bought .   But the main problem was that I had purchased a fuzzy Halloween blanket at one of their other locations earlier in the month and I discovered a few days ago that they had overcharged me for it by $5. Very clearly the tag  said it was $9.99 yet the clerk or cash register charged me $14.99. I picked up the same blanket at this store and it scanned at $9.99 here.    I had a receipt that clearly showed the code numbers matched the brand new blanket I bought and showed that I had been charged $14.99 for it but the manager kept looking at it as if somehow I had altered something to cheat them . Then he said that because it had been over 7 days I would have to drive to the OTHER location to resolve the problem even though it was about 8 miles and would have cost me $5 in gas to drive there and back .   On top of that I bypassed some of the things that I might have bought that they had prices on that were actually higher that they cost new.   For instance they had two skeins of yarn that Big Lots sells for a dollar apiece but Savers had marked $2.99 for the two skiens. Another skien that I could probably buy at Michaels for under $2.99 with a coupon they had marked $2.99, etc etc. Their used Halloween items are as much as $15 to $20 . They had a pair of child rain boots for $7.99 . You get the picture.   There is a Savers location on Power Road that actually has normal thrift store prices unlike this one. No wonder there aren't very many people in here. Especially when they overcharge customers which is clear on the receipt and then refuse to give the customer credit toward their purchase of that day. Right now I'm thinking of that scene in The Wizard of Oz where Auntie Em says that she's not going to say what she's really thinking because she's a Christian lady.

I came in here back when they first opened and I was in town. I really enjoyed the Fry Bread Taco , as did my daughter. This has become one of my "be sure to visit" places in Mesa on consequent trips.   I stopped in yesterday and was definitely not disappointed. The Indian Taco was huge and I only intended to eat half of it but it was pretty full and messy and the delicious insides kept tumbling out so I got a spoon and kept taking bites. I knew the fry bread would lose the wonderful crispness if I were to eat  it later and I hadn't eaten all day so I finished the whole thing and, while comfortable, was full the rest of the evening. This place is definitely worth seeking out and trying. I look forward to returning next trip.  Oh, and there is a huge parking lot since it is in the strip mall so you can park right in front.

Good food for a good price.  First time I've eaten at this location but it was as good as I hoped.  I got a half size Crunch Roll for an appetizer, and an order of Chicken Yakisoba.  Both were very good.  The crunch roll was very fresh with good quality ingredients, crunchy shrimp Tempura, crab, avocado, etc.  The yakisoba wasn't quite what I thought it would be in that the noodles and meat were separate, not mixed, but that didn't affect the quality or flavor.  It was closing time and I'd only eaten half, but I packed up the rest and brought it back to my motel so the workers could finish up and go home.   This was the fourth place I'd attempted to go to for dinner so I was especially happy to find them open.  The first place, Azucar Peruvian, was right across the street from the motel I always stay at and I'd been meaning to try them since last summer.  I drove over there to find they were now out of business with a sign up advertising the place going in next.  I snoozed, I loozed.   The second place was supposed to be open till 8:30pm according to their Yelp listing, but was closed when I got there a  few minutes after 8.  The third place, Omega Gyros, highly recommended on Yelp, was also out of business.  FML.   So when I got to Yogi's I was holding my breath till I saw they were open till nine.  Thank you Yogi's!

My 700th review (finally!).   Hmmm, needs to be someplace special to me, just as my other "Centennial" reviews were.  I decided to choose Chandler, AZ, a city I sort of adopted, or maybe it adopted me, in 2007.  Oh, I had been visiting it since I started college in San Diego in 1966, even before that a few times, a visit for Xmas in 1954 from where my family lived in Ohio, again in June of 1955 to be my cousin Barbara Gaddis Knox's flower girl, later in 1965 from Michigan as part of a trip out west to look at colleges in California, Nevada, Colorado.  Then trips for some  Thanksgivings and Easters, since the Knoxes were my closest relatives to San Diego, and finally for most Thanksgivings and Christmases after my parents chose Chandler to retire in from 1973 on.   But it was always as a visitor, with the focus on visiting  family, not the area.  That all changed in January of 2007 when I rushed here, driving all night, after my mother had a heart attack and I didn't even know if she had survived the night till I arrived at 6am.  My father had passed away in Dec. 2000.  She seemed to to be on the mend and I stayed to be with her during what was supposed to be her recovery but at 89 she just didn't have the strength to bounce back and passed away three weeks later.  By then I had been staying in her house and doing the upkeep, shopping in the area, making friends with the neighbors, and now had the daunting task of going thru her possessions, many of which were family keepsakes, and deciding what should be done with them.  I mention all this only to give background on how I came to live here.  It seemed like the longer I stayed, the more I grew to love the area, in spite of the sad circumstances that brought me here.  I ended up being here for nine months, using the post offices, libraries, grocery and hardware stores, taking classes at the local craft stores, driving all over exploring, enjoying the beautiful spring weather, marvelling at the power of nature during dust storms and monsoons, experiencing the triple digit heat in the summer, eating at the variety of local restaurants, making acquaintances and friends wherever I went.  I enjoyed it so much I didn't want to return to San Diego!  People would ask me where I was from and them ask what I was doing HERE instead of beautiful San Diego and I found myself answering, "Because I love it here!" My line was, "I'm a San Diego snowbird!".   I was really sad to leave here, thinking I might never get back.    Sadly, a cousin passed away the next July so I did come back.  I stayed about a week.  Then a few months later my daughter who lives in Mesa talked me into coming out for Easter and I stayed longer.  Then again in a few months, each trip lasting longer than the last.  I still love coming back here, and spent over half of last year (2010) here!  Not all in Chandler, part in Mesa, but still in the area.   If anyone asks me if I would recommend this area to live, I give them a resounding yes!  If I could have kept my parents' house, I think I would have stayed here myself.

This is how it's done.  Wonderfully friendly people who remember their customers and make good food for a reasonable price.  This is not your grody fast food stand in the food courts of yesteryear.  This is good stuff.  That's about the best tabouli I ever had.  The falafel was excellent, if a little salty, hummus was perfect and my taste of my daughter's gyros was very good, not overly spicy.  It took me awhile to get here after reading about it on Yelp since it's inside the mall, but well worth the stop.  This is the first time I'd been here, yet the lady remembered me just from a phone call I made a month ago to inquire about their location when I couldn't find them and didn't realize they were inside the mall.  That impressed me.

I ended up driving past this location by accident after turning in the wrong entrance at Tempe Marketplace but decided to park and go in to ask a specific question: Is there such a thing as a portable printer designed for cell phone users who travel and use their Android phone for internet so we can print out coupons, directions, even a recipe directly from the phone without connecting to a computer.  I found clerks who were knowledgeable and told me there was no such product, unfortunately.  One did suggest if I was near a wireless printer and had my phone programmed for it I could print on that.  I left feeling they had helped me even though the answer was no.  And they referred me to Fry's Electronics for further research.

Great place to buy all manner of beauty supply products and I found the owner ( at least I think she was) to be very helpful.  I was in here several times in 2010, my last visit to Mesa.  Unfortunately when I drove thru the little center this was in today, the store was empty and signage was down.  Whether they moved or closed I will have to find out but it is gone, along with at least two other businesses I know of in this particular center, the wonderful little Z-lantro Mexican restaurant I frequented on my last trip, and the Blue Goat restaurant I found on Yelp but didn't find in the center.  So sad.

I can't recall ever having a bad experience in here.  I sometimes have come in after a specific item and sometimes come in just to browse and see what's new.  When I have questions I can find people to answer them and the people are very pleasant.  The prices are fair if not cheap and the store often has items I haven't seen anywhere else.  I was able to order inexpensive curtains with the " pinch pleat" for our office.  I know I will pop in here every time I'm in town and rarely leave without finding something I can use, even if it's not what I came after.

This is probably the Dollar Tree I went to most often while visiting my daughter in Mesa.  Sometimes she was with me, buying baby shower invitations and wedding thank you notes and household supplies, pet treats, etc, and sometimes I was by myself buying cleaning supplies to clean her less than tidy apartment or filling in missing utensils, a loaf pan, dish cloths, scrubby sponges, whatever I needed, even half and half for my coffee.  Kleenex, paper towels, a couple of nightlights, just you-name-it.  Most of this would have cost me two to three times as much even at Walmart.  I sure was glad they were here.

Mmmm--me likey!    I found this on Yelp and was glad to find a BBQ place so close to my daughter's apartment I'm visiting.  I was the designated child care for my new step-granddaughter this afternoon so I said, "Hey, let's go out to lunch!"  We headed for Andrew's 2nd location on Southern near Dobson.  First impression--specious, clean, bright, cheerful.    The Kids Meal seemed a little high at $5 till I saw what she got--about ten little mini corn dogs (she only ate two, though she liked them, just eats like a bird), huge pile of excellent fries, and drink of choice (chocolate milk). The mini corn dogs were fixed really well, deep fried like little fritters, crunchy and crisp.  I got a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on a hamburger bun with one side (cole slaw) also for $5.  The pork was tender and non-greasy, had wonderful mild flavor, and the BBQ sauce, which you pump as much as you want out of a big jug, had great flavor.  There was a spicier version available if you preferred. Cole slaw was very good--I forgot to ask if it was homemade by them but it tasted like it could be.  The girl behind the counter was very cheerful and didn't rush me in choosing.  She said she usually works at the Guadalupe location but I'm glad she was here today.    As we sat and ate a leisurely  lunch I looked around and started noticing all the rock and roll posters and even album covers that seemed to be from the 70's and 80's, maybe a couple of 60's.   That added kind of a unique touch to the place.  If I lived in this area, I would definitely be frequenting this place!

This Dollar tree is well maintained but not one of the larger versions and doesn't have some of the items the larger stores have. I only bought three things this trip because I didn't need much and they didn't have some of the items I have bought at DT's before.  But what I got would have surely been 2-3X as much even at Wal-Mart.  In talking with the cashier, I found out this is the store that replaced the one at Az Ave and Ray when it closed.  I'm sure I'll be back because this is now the location closest to me.

I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the price, less so with the service. Everyone was very nice but once we got our food, the empty plates took forever to be taken away and they didn't check to see if we needed drink refills (it's Arizona after all) until it was time to pay.   But the food was mostly really good and the lemonade tasted fresh-made  (I don't know if it was). I was so hungry after not eating all day (too busy playing with my new EVO phone, hahaha) and I took a plateful of the salads and sushi's before I even saw that there were like 5 or 6 other bars to choose from. It was kind of overwhelming.   The seafood salad was so refreshing and good even though I'm sure it just had the "krab", the sushi's were good for cheap buffet fare, the oyster or mussel or whatev with the spicy red sauce on it was plump and juicy, the broccoli salad was extra good, and I had so many other items on my plate of hot food I can't even remember them all. The orange chicken was good but pretty well-cooked, the crab legs were way too done, my daughter's H said the egg rolls weren't very good, the noodles were average, the pastry with crab mixture in it was divine as were the stuffed mushrooms, chicken skew wasn't very moist but had good flavor, same with the salmon, the pork rib was so good and tender with rich flavor that I thought oh no, I' won't be able to finish it I'm so full, but I kept taking tiny bites till I did.  There were some dunplings that were very good and a mussel with cheese sauce in the shell that was real nice, too.  Some of the cakes/desserts had a fruity undertone I didn't care for (I just had tastes of my daughter's) but I kept going back like a mouse to nibble on her almond cookie, so yes, it was good. She was disappointed that in this 105 degree weather the ice cream machine was broken. My dinner was 10% off with a coupon and came to about $9 for dinner AND drink. They had a buy-one-get-one-for-50% coupon so theirs was $15 something for the two of them after tax.    We unanimously agreed we would be back to try more of the things we liked and the items we didn't get to, and that we had gotten a great value for our money!

I love the new Hobby Lobby!  And it opened just in time for my visit to Mesa Arizona!  I understand they opened Thursday but their official Grand Opening is today, June 14th.   Since we don't have any of these stores in San Diego I try to visit them in other towns when I am there and this one is about the nicest I've been to.  They were  having such killer sales I spent a bundle yesterday and am headed back over there today to visit the departments I ran out of time to see yestereday.    I plan  to add this to my list of places to visit every time I come to town now!

Another one found on Yelp.  It only took me a couple of days to get here after learning about it.  I brought my 6-year old new granddaughter (by marriage)--fresh blood!  A new person to introduce to exotic foods that is--haha!    I ordered a lamb souvlaki in Pita bread with rice on the side for me, a chicken souvlaki "mini" sandwich with rice  for her, a spinach spanikopita just to try, and two desserts.  What I got looked like a full dinner plate of three kabobs, one chicken, one lamb and one beef, with the pita bread, diced tomatoes, thin-sliced onions, tzatziki sauce, and rice on the side and she got THREE chicken kabobs with the same side stuff.    Everything was delicious and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try a "combination" of their offerings rather than just one.  The chicken was the real winner, charred and moist at the same time with wonderful flavor. The tzatziki sauce wasn't as garlicky as I've had in the past and I missed the stronger flavor.  I couldn't really tell which was the beef and which was the lamb.  They were both good but not nearly as tender as the chicken.    The rice was good, especially after I squeezed some lemon juice over it. The spanikopita was perfect, a crispy triangle stuffed full of a delicious spinach mixture that reminded me of the homemade ones my Greek next door neighbors use to make back in Michigan.    Both desserts were very good, my melamacarona had the right flavor though not as honey-moist as the best I've had, her baklava, the tiny taste I got, had just the right flavor.    They have a bar area so I would love to go back there for dinner sometime and have a glass of Retsina with my meal.  When I asked how long they's been open they said only threee weeks.  If they keep up the good service and the great food I think they will be a success.  6/19/10

Cheapest gas prices in town!!  A couple of weeks ago I paid $2.49/gallon.  Yesterday it was $2.59 when most places are over $2.60 or even to $2.77!  The clerk was real nice, too.

TThis place is just around the corner from my motel and just opened last summer.  I resisted coming here for awhile because I can get perfectly good Mexican food back home in San Diego.  But I finally stopped in about a week ago to get a lite bite before going to the movies with my daughter, just cuz it was close and cheap.  I got a three taco special for under $5 and it was perfect.  The atmosphere was nice, spacious, clean, Latin music in the background, very friendly clerks/owners.  The tacos were simple, and simply delicious. I got one steak, one chicken adaboba, and one pork.  The pork was my favorite.  I stopped in a few days later when I had to be out of the room so the maids could come in, got a Bacon and egg burrito with cheese, also under $5, and it was about the best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  I ate half there and saved half to eat for breakfast the next morning.  The reheated one was as good as the first  half.  Even home cooking doesn't get any better than this.  Both of the owners, a husband and wife team, are as nice as can be, which always makes a place more pleasant.

We were on our way to Panda Express but spotted this place in the same parking lot and decided to check it out.  They have three categories of sandwiches, $3.50, $4.50 and $5.50.  We each got variations of roast beef sandwiches on 8" French rolls for $5.50 ea.  Both were delicious.  They make the bread on the premises so it was uber fresh and soft, not leathery like some places.  Absolutely no grisly or chewy spots, every bite tender and easy to chew.  My only complaint is they had no pepperocini and as good as it was it was kind of bland until I followed my daughter's example and put a little mustard on it.    I like that the clerks greeted us as we walked in and answered all my questions cheerfully.  Oh, and the sandwiches were ready before we could step away from the counter, lickety split.  I was surprised when the clerk said they were open till 10pm weeknights, midnight on weekends.  Wow.  Most delis close mid-afternoon.  If you are looking for a healthy, fresh sandwich late at night, this is the place to go.  I'll be back!

Gas prices have been going up again recently so I really appreciate that the cheapest station I have seen in days is right around the corner from my motel.  As of today, 11/21/10, their price is $2.69, less than the $2.71-$2.89 it is running other places. If you are anywhere near the NW corner of Country Club and 60, check this place out.

Okay, now I'm mad.  I stopped here based on the huge sign advertising gas at $2.79/gal.  I wasn't sure if this station took credit cards or just debit so I stuck my card in and it worked.  Yeah!  I happened to look down at the meter when I started pumping. FORTUNATELY, and to my surprise it said the price was $2.89!  I shut it off at 4 gallons, enough to keep me from driving any further on fumes (but I was fuming by now) and pulled around to where I could see the tall sign again.  In small words under the $2.79 it said, Cash and credit cards only.  Now, if I had squinted my eyes to read all that while driving, I probly would have rear-ended somebody.   At least I caught it before I filled the tank with 24 gallons@ $2.89/gal.  Now I'm off to my fav station  on University where it is $2.72.    PS--to my San Diego friends, yes I'm spoiled by AZ prices!

I needed beer and the brand they had on sale at CVS gives me headaches so I came in here to see what they had.  I was tickled pink, or rather lavender, when I spotted a Snuggie in purple!!  Of course I had to have it--you never know when the next Snuggie Pub Crawl will be!  I tossed some nose spray and nail color to my stash along with some PBR, headed for the cash register and waited in a line about three people deep.  No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.    But after the kid rang me up, he informed me I would have to go to the register across the way because he wasn't old enough to sell me the beer.  There was only one person in that line when he said that, but on cue two more people joined the line as I started over there.  I asked the kid, Do I have to wait through the line again? and he got flustered and didn't seem to know what to say.   I got in the line and waited my turn, but let the other clerk know a customer shouldn't have to wait through two lines to pay for their purchases.  If the kid can't sell alcohol he should let the people in his line know before they waste their time there.

Good grief, here it is two years later, I'm back in the area, without remembering that this was the place where I had the earlier experience (see my previous review)  and the same thing happened as before except this time there was no long line.    I'm at the counter on the right with my six pack of cheap beer, happy it was only $2.99, go to pay and the kid tells me I have to go to the counter across the way to pay for it because he's under age.  Helloooo.  If this is (still) an issue, why not train these babies to glance down their line to check if anyone is holding alcohol so they can give them a heads up that they  can't purchase it in their line?  And I wonder how many times this same thing has happened to OTHER customers in the two years since I wrote my first review??

I went to this location today after seeing the sign for Dori's Bakery. I met the owner/baker and she is very nice. She gave me a sample of her chicken salad and I loved it. She has baked goods and also sandwiches, soups, quiche, and chicken pot pie, which you can take home frozen but if you want to eat it there you should call ahead as they take an hour to bake. She said everything is made fresh. I had just eaten over at the Peruvian place in the same center but plan to go back for a soup and salad, maybe a pastry or cookie. Oh yeah,she has  cheesecake, too, but I don't know if is the same kind as the previous place, Arizona Cheesecake had. I would have liked to taste theirs after reading the reviews.

My 999th review!  This Goodwill had a friendly feel as soon as I walked in.  The stuff was in good condition, maybe priced a little higher than I'd like, but I'd still come back.  Today, Friday, orange tags were half off.  Naturally everything I liked had purple tags or other colors. I still found about $13 worth of stuff to buy for grandkids, crafts, etc.  Worth the unscheduled stop.  Like so many area thrift stores it is in a former grocery store with a large lot so parking is a snap.

I was very impressed.  A sweet waitress with a winning smile greeted me as soon as I walked in, seated  me immediately, gave me time to read my menu since it was my first time here, and brought my glass of water right away.    I asked for a recommendation and was told the Basil Chicken was one of the more popular dishes.  I decided to get it and requested it mild.  My plate arrived expeditiously and was absolutely delicious.  The ingredients were good quality and fresh, it was very well-prepared and perfectly seasoned.    Everything around me looked and felt clean.  By felt, I mean it was a joy to rest my elbows on a tabletop that didn't feel all sticky like so many places.    The decor is not fancy but very simple with pretty flowers at each table.  Both the tables and table service look appealing when you walk in and the silverware and plates weren't totally cheap quality like in so many places.  This was one if those meals where it tasted so good I couldn't stop taking "just one more bite" (repeat till plate is empty).    Would I go back?  Well, let's just say I asked to see their lunch menu and was already plotting what I would try the next time I came in.  Since it is only about a block from my motel I'm sure to be back!  Update:  A couple weeks after the first visit I felt like I was coming down with s bad cold and just wanted soup.  Since I couldn't find any Jewish Deli in the area I opted to come in here and ordered the Tom Yum Soup.  I wondered why it was $8.99--till I saw it.  It was in a huge metal tureen with a fire lit under it and it was delicious.  It was extremely hot, as in spicy, even though I had ordered it at a level two.  But it sure cleaned out my sinuses, haha!  I are till I was full and got a container to bring the rest back to my motel, where I finished it later that night.  Man it was good.  An older lady was my server this time and she was extremely nice, even offered to take the soup back to add more broth to cut the spiciness.  I told her that wasn't necessary.  Now, what shall I have next time......?

Wow no wonder this place has 8/8- five star reviews. I'm adding the mine to the mix.   I was looking for a place to eat yesterday, Sunday after Day 2 of the Rubber Stamp Show at the Convention Center a few blocks away and a lot of places were already closed for the day or by 5 o'clock. I found this one on Yelp and even though my tummy hadn't completely recovered from the stomach flu that I had a few days ago I decided to give them a shot. Gut instinct, pun intended.   I sure wasn't sorry. Being South American food I was concerned about it being too spicy for my still somewhat delicate condition. I had nothing to fear. I mentioned to the girl at the counter that I didn't want anything spicy and she assured me the food wasn't. She asked if I would like some recommendations since I hadn't been there before and I agreed. The first thing she did was smile and point to the Bono bread in the little display case to my right and told me how good that was which was totally true.  It was a dollar for one roll and was almost sweet enough to qualify as a cookie, very fresh and delicious. It could have easily been eaten as a light dessert at the end.   FTR, I'm one of those people that doesn't usually order drinks because it's hard to pay $2 for something I can buy for a quarter from the grocery, but when I saw they had the fruit smoothie type drinks, or fruit juices they called them, I decided to try one out. I believe they were $2.75.  I was going to get a fruit that I was familiar with like strawberry or Blackberry or guava but she recommended the Guanabana fruit drink and I decided to take her word for it.  She asked if I wanted it blended with water or milk and I thought milk would be healthier. It too was extremely fresh and delicious. I look forward to ordering a different flavor next time.   Then she told me about the daily special, a chicken dish with two sides, and pointed to a lady in a booth that had one in front of her,  It looked absolutely delicious.  It was $10.95 which seemed a fair price for the quantity of food and what I suspected would be the quality, but I I was a little worried that it might be too spicy or tomato-y so I decided to order ala carte off the menu.   I wanted to try the empanadas so I got a beef one.  It wasn't huge but it was delicious and homemade and seat well with my tummy and my taste buds. The last thing I ordered was what they called a corn cake with shredded chicken.  It wasn't at all what I envisioned. I was picturing a piece of cornbread like you would find in a southern-cooking place that had sort of a chicken gravy over the top. I wasn't too far off with the chicken part but the "corn cake" was more like a thick tortilla. That didn't matter because it too was mild and delicious, in fact so much so I was wishing there was some pepper to sprinkle over it. Instead I sprinkled a little bit of the mildly spicy green sauce that came with the empanada over it and that livened it up a little.   Even though the portions didn't look large I got full before I finished and asked for a container to bring home about half of the corn cake with chicken which I ate later in the evening. I didn't have room for any of their delicious sounding desserts so I will have to go back to try more things including the dessert. In fact I'll have to go back several times I think to try various foods, drinks and desserts. I suspect they will all be as delicious as what I had. All I can say is a sure wish I'd found this place sooner although it is fun to find new places no matter how long I stay in an area. I think I may have seen this place listed before but assumed it was yet another Mexican place and I don't eat a lot of Mexican food since I can get that in San Diego .   In talking with the clerk she had asked me if I had ever had Colombian food. I told her about some of the various places I've been in the area that were Central and South American--Puerto Rican, Venezuelan, Salvadorian, Cuban, etc but she said that this place was the only Columbian place around. I told her I could definitely taste that it was unique from the other places. I forgot to ask her how long they have been open, if I might have overlooked them on previous trips or if they were recent . And not to go too TMI on you the food sat VERY well on my iffy tummy.

I'm afraid I have to agree with the other reviewers who cited the employees being rude.  The kids had a blast and the two adults enjoyed watching the kids, ages 2 and 4, have fun. But we were snapped at for not getting on the last ride fast enough, in fact I was barely seated when he practically peeled away with the train hauling about ten cars full of adults and kids and where the other rides had been leisurely and enjoyable, he zoomed us through the route so fast our hair was blowing back and we were back at the starting point about 2 minutes after we left even though we went around the whole park.  The worst part was when we left at six we went out to our car, which was one of only two in that section of the parking lot.  We got the kids strapped in, which was no easy task because the two year old was screaming and crying because she knew getting in the carseat meant we were leaving and she didn't want to leave. My daughter gave them a bottle of water which they then started fighting over. Amidst all the screaming I was on my phone Yelping a close kid-friendly restaurant or fast food place to take them to eat because we didn't have time to eat at the park without it cutting into our riding and playing time.   Suddenly I heard a knock on the window and an older man asked if everything was okay and let us know they could hear the screaming all the way over to the exit area, which wasn't that far away. In a friendly way I assured him everything was fine but they were just crying because they were tired from the long and enjoyable afternoon. He looked at us like he didn't believe us and he kept looking in the back seat at the children, who had stopped crying at this point because they were interested in who was talking to us. He asked if they needed water and we told him we had just given them some . He asked again so I thanked him and said that would be fine and that we appreciated it (even though we didn't really need it, just to make him happy).   He then told me that he had written down the license plate on the car and not to leave, implying that he was going to call the police and report us if we left, just because we had a crying 2 year old throwing a tantrum because she didn't want to leave the park! I tried to keep things friendly and we sat there waiting for him to come back and he again kept asking us if everything was okay. Both children were in the backseat strapped into legal carseats, no one was reaching back and beating them or torturing them, the AC was on. I can't believe in a park that caters to children that they have never seen a meltdown before. I don't particularly think it was very good PR for them to threaten to report a customer just because they had a crying toddler. That turned an otherwise enjoyable afternoon into a rather nasty aftertaste. At best he could have handled it more tactfully.    Do I recommend this place to others?  Only if you have children that don't cry I guess.

I was just looking at the pictures I took when I was here last year and realized I had never gotten my review written.  I was just driving by and spotted this place and decided to try it out.  I was impressed there were mostly Latinos in there, in fact everyone but me, so I figured the food must be good.  I mainly went in for seafood and the Ceviche tostada I got was excellent.  But it was a cold day so I got a bowl of Caldo de Res, which I had never had before, and it was sooo good.  Perfect!  I left satisfied and with a warm tummy. I hope it's still there when I come back so I can eat there again!  September 29, 2012:   I'm back in town and returned here late this evening.  I stand by my original review and opinions.  The girl behind the counter was extremely nice, the place smelled wonderful and the food was delicious.  There was not a thing wrong with the entire experience.  I had no gastronomic problems after.  I recommend this place with no hesitation.    I got a Ceviche Tostada because I remembered how good it was last time and it didn't disappoint.  I made a last minute decision to get the huge Chile Relleno on display and it may have been the best one I've ever had in 30 years of enjoying them.  I mean, what more do we want?  Great food, clean, Mexican band blaring.  It was so good I didn't even have any leftovers.

I ALWAYS get the assistance I need in here and all the guys are helpful and friendly, not to mention they have the expertise to solve any phone problems I've had while in town and patiently answer my numerous questions.  I never feel like I'm being dismissed, ignored or not taken seriously.  Top notch guys with a sense of humor when I crack a joke or make a pun.  They're all good but if in doubt ask for Jesse!  It's nice to be recognized when I go in even though I don't even live in town but just a visitor from San Diego.  Highly recommended all around!

I have been meaning to stop in here for at least a month just to look around because I do enjoy looking through quilt shops even though I don't actually quilt.    The hours on the door indicate they are open till 8 or so but they're only open till 5.  I think the website does say that.  One reason I hadn't gotten by yet was because they aren't open very late.   The fabrics they carry are just beautiful and looked really good quality.  The prices are not cheap, I think I looked at a couple bolts in the $10 yard range but I would say well worth it if you want a good quality quilt.  They have a certain amount of accessories and embellishments as well.   The lady who runs the store and her son were extremely nice.  I just walked around looking.   It was pushing 5 o'clock so I left. I didn't need anything so I didn't buy anything but I would highly recommend it to anyone who does do quilting.  There is plenty of parking in the adjoining lot.

Nice Post Office, centrally located in the center of downtown Mesa, though not on the main street, adequate parking, no problems.  Kinda reminds me of my PO back home.

I love Goodwills, especially on half priced Saturday's every two weeks!  East Valley has a plethora of them and my daughter and I had never been to this one or any others this far east of us so we made the trip to check it out.  I had been told it was bigger than the others, which we didn't find to be so, but we still enjoyed shopping here and finding some good deals.  To make it even better there is a Savers and a 99¢ Only Store in the same center!  The Savers had even better prices and was the best Savers (read: not overpriced like the others) I'd been to in years.

As close as this location is to where I stay, I had never been to it before.  They weren't as fast to prepare as the one at Baseline and Country Club or the one by Chandler Mall.  I got the Italian and my daughter got the  turkey.  Both were fresh and delicious and a good size for the money, $5.95 each. They only cut the sandwich in half if you request it so my torpedo was whole.  They said it had an oil and vinegar dressing but it was so light as to be indiscernible.  If they had pepperocinis I wasn't aware of it.  The roll was wonderful.   All was fine till I decided it needed a little oomph and went up to the counter to ask for pepper since there were no shakers on the tables.  What? No pepper??  I can't fathom that.  I didn't like the loud music either.  Will I go back? Hell yeah.  But I'll take my own pepper.

The Classic Grille is a hamburger place in the food court of the of Fiesta Mall.  We had excellent hamburgers a with real meat and they make their own patties, fresh ingredients in a nice toasted bun. I really like that crunchy toasted bun. The french fries were a little better than average.  At first I didn't think the chocolate milkshake tasted very "malty" but when I started slipping it out of the straw instead of eating it with the spoon off the top  I began to taste the rich malt flavor.  It was made with real ice cream too, you could tell. I even doubled back and told the employees how good everything was. I paid about 14 dollars for 2 meals including a $4 dollar malt which I didn't think was bad.  I would definitely go back, and I'm not a big hamburger fan.  Just when it's done right!  Dec. 10,2012: Came back here tonight because the Catfish Grille was closed, which I mentioned to the employee, who then told me about their fish items including a Grilled Tilapia sandwich on toasted bread. It was under $6 including fries and really good. You can tell quality of ingredients and preparation is important to these guys. I'll bet their fish and chips are good too. I'll have to try them next time. They are super nice to you too. They need to give lessons to that server over at Village Inn!

I was pretty impressed with at least parts of this Food Court.  There are some chain stands like Subway, Panda Express, Cinnabon, Sbarro, a grilled subs place, some Japanese food that looks like a chain, Chinese, pizza, Hot Dogs on a Stick chain, a classic hamburger place, Orange Julius (which I always loved but it's gotten so expensive).    My favorite place from when I was in the area two years ago was a really good Mediterranean restaurant but it's a Mexican place now.    Saving the best for last, there are three additions I really like.  One is Julie's Chicken and Waffles which I ate at yesterday and intend to go back to.  Both the chicken legs and waffle we're delicious!  They serve breakfast items till noon and that is what I'll try to get next time.  On the way in the food court a lady offered me a catfish sample from the Catfish place and nearly succeeded in waylaying me from the chicken place because the sample was so good!  I will definitely be eating there soon.  And where the pretzel place used to be there is now a Mexican ice cream and drinks stand that looked very interesting.  I love fresh fruit Aguas Frescas and am anxious to see if they make them.  My favorite place on Country Club Dr., Flor de Michuacan (sp?) has closed so I was needing to find a new placeam to buy those.  The food court hours are the same as the mall, Mon-Sat 10-9, Sun 11-6..  The only problem I had was I went on a Sunday and five minutes after I sat down with my piping hot chicken a security guard came up and told meme they were locking the doors in 15 minutes and it was hard to rush thru my food when it wasn't even cooled off enough to eat.  All in all I still enjoyed my meal and plan to go back!

This is my daughter's go-to gas station and it usually has the lowest price or very close to, so I go here too.  Arco is hard to beat price-wise.  It is well kept up and easy to use.  There is a 35cent charge to use your debit card, par for Arco stations, and they don't take credit cards.  But at least thru don't put a cash only price in the marquee and then gouge you for a dime more per gallon when you use your card.

I'm always a Sprouts fan, and Henry's before that, and Boney's before that.  It's nice to find one in Az like the one near me in Cali.  This trip I was looking for ingredients to make homemade baby wipes including Witch Hazel, Aloe Vera, and Dr. Bonners Castile liquid soap.  I was mainly pricing but their price on the castile soap was good enough I just bought a bottle of the lavender version for $6.99.  If I'd had more time I would've looked around more but we were out running a ton of errands so I just made a fast run.  The employees were as helpful and knowledgeable as ever. The checkout line was fast. Parking was easy.  I will be back!

This brand new Big Lots is located in the newly renovated former Ross Store at Alma School and Southern.  They had their Grand Opening October 18th, 2012.  I think they will be an asset to the Poca Fiesta Shopping Center, which has suffered from the economy in recent years.  I came in the next day and was mostly wowed by how bright and clean and organized it was.  They have a lot of merchandise, though I don't think Big Lots in general has as varied and interesting a selection as they used to years ago, or even prices as cheap.  But their prices still beat most other stores except the dollar stores.  The employees were all working industriously at stocking and straightening and the ones I talked to stopped to help me cheerfully when asked.  I like that.  I complimented them on how nice everything looked, especially for being nearly closing time when you would expect it to be in  disarray from all the customers throughout the day.  They are especially well-stocked in seasonal items, being as it's October.  And their furniture looked very nice.  I was sad to see the other two locations I was used to closed but since this one is closer and nicer, I'm sure it will meet my needs when I'm in town.

My daughter and I were headed for Jimmy Johns with the babbies for a bite to eat when I spotted the grand opening sign for this place and the word Hawaiian.  Screeeech!  We went here instead and were very glad.  Not only were the two ladies behind the counter as nice as could be, very helpful, very patient concerning a fussy baby and active toddler, but the food was fantastic!    When I saw the soups on the menu I asked them where were they two weeks ago when I was coming down with the cold from hell and wanted nothing but chicken soup to eat?    They evidently had just opened a few days earlier.  I got a BBQ Mix that included beef, chicken and short ribs, all tender and moist with wonderful flavor.  My daughter got a Chicken and Seafood Mix that included shrimp and white fish.  We traded bites and everything was delicious.  So were the Crab Puffs we got as an appetizer.  Nummy!   I posted pictures.  And to top it off everything on the menu was 25% off as a Grand Opening special.  So it was wonderful AND a bargain.  My only regret is the 25% off was only till Oct 31st and I meant to get back again by then but didn't.  I'll still try to return before I leave the area, though.  Parking is a piece of cake--there's a huge lot.  I highly recommend this spot.

This is a gem of a find and I didn't even find it on yelp!  I was with my daughter picking up my grandson from his new Children's Center so I could see it, with a quick stop at the GoodWill next door in the same strip mall and we were leaving the parking lot to go to the Teriyaki Kitchen across the street when I saw this little place occupying the corner location as we were driving by,  I exclaimed "There's another Filipino place!". I had recently discovered Heavenly Bakery in Chandler on Yelp.  Over the next few days I tried researching it online for their hours of operation and info on what they carry and found the name "Why Cook?" associated with this address.  I tried calling the number three different times but got no answer the first time and fax screeching the next two.  Finally I asked my daughter yesterday if she would drive past it and call me with any info in their window.  She did and said they were open and read the phone number on the door which was different than the one I'd found online.  I called and was told they would be open till 7:30 or 8. I headed over as soon as I got ready.  The owners couldn't have been nicer, the aromas were delectable.  There were about six tables and the counter where you order.  There is a buffet selection with about 8 items to choose from at $4.50 for one including rice and $5.50 for two.  I was huuuungry and asked how much for three.  $1 more.  I chose some fried fish, a bowl of sinigang, and a vegetable mixture. Everything was served to me right away and it was all delicious.  The sinigang, one of my favorites since I first tasted it from the Lumpia House in Chandler back in 2007, was some of the best I'd ever had.  The fish was very crunchy and good.  I just picked it up with my fingers and chewed it off the bones.  There was about every kind of vegetable known to man in the veggie dish, green beans, okra, squash, carrots,  and several I couldn't identify.  When I went to pay I decided to splurge and get an order of Pancit, another favorite, to go for later or the next day.   It was closing time but the food was still coming out of the kitchen for late customers and it, too, smelled good.  Must. Come. Back.  Parking is no problem.  There is a huge lot.  And as of this writing, 11/16/12, their hours are 8am to 8pm seven days a week.  I asked and was told they had just opened up about a month ago.  They offer many more items besides the buffet choices including Lumpia, Pancit, and silog, which I understand is a breakfast type plate including fried rice with your choice of meat (beef, pork, chicken, fish) and a couple of sunny side up eggs, available all day.  Sounds good!

This is one of the newest Goodwill stores.  It's pretty big and has a lot of stuff with more coming in daily.  There's almost always some color tag on sale, they have a senior day and one Saturday a month everything in the store is 50% off--yay!  It's pretty easy to get to, just south of 202 on Arizona Ave., and has a huge parking lot.  We usually combine it with trips to the Goodwill at Alma School and Ray Rd. and the Savers just up Arizona Ave.  They all have pretty nice merchandise, especially in clothing.  I buy yarn there when ever they have it, too.

What??? There's been a Krispy Kreme Donut Shop at Dobson and Main for two weeks and I didn't know about it?? I immediately canceled my errand on University and pulled into the Safeway parking lot. I've been craving a cream filled donut for weeks! But I thought the closest one was at Superstition Springs and I hadn't gotten out that far this trip. Okay, now to enjoy....

Lucky lucky me! And it's nice to have some of my Karma coming back to me!   I decided to try out the Longhorn Steakhouse Saturday night.  I thought it was a new location of a different restaurant of a similar name on Southern that had closed, but when I got there I discovered this was a brand new restaurant that hadn't even opened yet. The parking lot was full but when I got the to the front door I was told by the two people holding menus that this was a training night and not open to the public. I made a joke that it was too bad I couldn't be a trainee for the evening and went to leave when  they asked, Is it just you? and I said Yup, just me, so they handed me a menu and said you can go on in and sit in the bar area. The meal will be complimentary and we hope you enjoy your dinner.   After I picked my jaw up off the floor I walked in and was seated at the bar by a very nice hostess and an even nicer bartender named Jen came up to me and started explaining that I could order any meal on the menu, that it included either an appetizer or dessert, my choice, and she started describing the drinks to me. I thought the folks in front said drinks were included but I did get charged for the Margarita at the end, but that was okay because it was delicious and what was in the shaker filled the class twice so it was well worth it. I looked over the menu and couldn't believe what I was seeing. So many good choices! I asked if the combinations were included and she said yes, anything on the menu. I was thinking about getting the prime rib but she said they had run out of that because they only made a certain amount and the training had been going on all day  Still not believing my good luck I ordered the Filet and Lobster dinner, which would have been $26.99 any other night. The dinner came with a choice of dinner salad or Caesar, and I chose Caesar, a choice of side dishes and I chose fresh vegetables, and honey wheat bread with butter. The bread was fantastic, the Caesar salad was crisp and fresh.  The steak arrived before the lobster, one of the glitches they were working out in training. I took a bite of the steak which was melt in your mouth tender. I held off on eating more so I could include the lobster in my photo.  See my pictures. The filet had a wonderful grilled flavor and was cooked just right, medium rare. It did have a grisly  place on one side.  The lobster was very moist and juicy with excellent flavor and I savored every bite of both. The vegetables might have been a little overcooked, at least for my taste.  I would've expected them to be a little crisper, but they had good flavor.    I ate all the lobster but had a little piece of steak left over and decided to take my dessert in a to-go box to eat later.   I finished up my Margarita, had a nice conversation with Jen, and even the manager, Anthony, came over to ask if everything was fine.  From him I learned this is the first Longhorn location in Arizona, although they have others that will open soon in the Phoenix area.   San Diego, where I live, is SOL for the time being.   Our loss.  Oh, and the Key Lime Pie, which I ate later, was one of the best I ever tasted!  Aside from being complimentary, I would have gladly paid the price for this wonderful meal. I hereby give this restaurant the Mother Yelper stamp of approval and hope to get back here soon.  Bon Appetit!  Epilogue:  I went back on the official opening day, Tues, Dec. 11th, for lunch, and one other time before I left town.  The food was just as good both times.

I'd been seeing the sign for this place for a couple of months but thought it was a Seafood Market. Then I drove past it from the Southern Ave. side and realized it was an eatery. It's located in the former Kyoto Bowl location at Country Club and Southern. I stopped in to ask info just as they were closing a couple weeks ago and came back yesterday to try them out.   I found out they had an Oyster Po ' Boy sandwich and ordered it with a side of mac and cheese in place of the fries. A drink even came with the $6.99 price. I really enjoyed the sandwich, good flavor, fresh ingredients. The mac and cheese was a bit mushy but had good flavor and they were generous with the portion. I ate half my meal there and had half left for a second meal. The server, Bailey, was extremely nice and helpful in answering questions. We share a love of fairies! I hope to get back to try the shrimp and fish before I leave town.   This place conveniently located near many motels in the 60 & 87 area. There is a large parking lot right in front.

Maximum kudos to this place, and to Shannon in particular. I just wandered in here while window shopping to ask questions after having gone in the LensCrafters store to ask the same questions. I decided I liked what I heard in here and I was especially impressed with Shannon so I made an appointment to come back the next afternoon for my exam. They had told me I might be able to get my new glasses within an hour possibly if they have my prescription in stock,or the next day, which amazed me. I've always had to wait 2 weeks for new glasses and I won't be here in AZ in two weeks. I wanted a current RX when I went in to renew my drivers license when I return to San Diego.   My appointment the next afternoon went smoothly. The doctor was sort of a slightly gruffer version of Mr Rogers. I felt he was very thorough and examined my eyes for "floaters" and other maladies of maturing eyes. I was not surprised when he said I had a lot of them. I asked a lot of questions I had been formulating since my last exam and he answered them thoroughly. The assistant did the glaucoma exam and an area vision exam. All was fine with those. I ordered two pairs, one for distance only and one bifocals. I found two frames I really liked. They said the glasses would probably be ready the next day.   The next day I received a call that they would only be able to have one of the two pairs I ordered, the distance pair. I was happy at least I would have those you wear on drive home. But by the time I got there  after 6pm they had both pairs ready! Happy me!   I have to say, they went out of their way to have the correct lenses sent over from the Chandler location so I could pick up both at once. You can't ask for better service than that. Both were adjusted, and I received new cases to carry them in and  I walked out with better vision than I've had in years. I didn't like my previous pair of bifocals but I am extremely happy with these. Shannon really listened to my concerns about being able to do my crafting without getting a sore neck looking through the lower part. And I can see so well through the distance lenses I don't feel the need to change glasses to read a paper.   Maybe I'll just time my next appointment in a couple of years to coincide with a trip to AZ!   Oh, and pricewise, the exam was $71 including the $12 area vision test. The two pairs of glasses total were about $250,less than LensCrafters quoted me for one pair. I did upgrade to the poly-carbonate lenses on both pairs, transitional on one pair so they turn dark when I go outside (which I love!), and the price includes frames that were about $75 each. One frame was even those twistable, unbreakable ones that usually sell for $200-300 but was on sale.

My grandson decided he didn't want to go in the bounce houses provided at the July 4th activities so my daughter suggested taking the kids to this  playground area to kill time before the fireworks started.  He and his not quite two year old sister had a blast here!  Everything was pretty safe with lots to do and lots of space for the gazillions of kids who were here.  I just wish it was enclosed so we didn't have to run all over trying to keep track of them every minute to make sure they didn't run off site.  And that it wasn't so darn hot, though it had cooled off a bit (I think) from the dust storm/monsoon that hit last night.  Still, over 90° after 9pm!

I was just driving thru the parking lot and I saw the word HOBBY so I had to stop in and see what they had.  It is a store geared to model building and they have all kinds of supplies related to that, parts and pieces, tools and paints, kits and accessories, you name it.  If you build models it is worth going to see this store.  The employee was very nice, too.

When I got to town I looked online for a rental car because I had taken the train here. I decided to go with Enterprise.   My daughter recommended the office at Alma School and Broadway because she had used them in the past so I entered that location as my choice  The website said that they had free pick up and drop off so I called them up and asked for a ride over there, which is only about a mile north. They said they would have to call me back when someone was going to head over.  I had an appointment an hour and a half later which was plenty of time.    I NEVER heard back from them. I finally called THIS location about a mile south of me, explained the situation which at this point I only had maybe half an hour to get to my appointment. This location on Baseline was very understanding and very efficient. They sent someone over within 15 minutes, zooming me down to the office, had me fill out the paperwork quickly and I was on my way in a Dodge Avenger to my appointment which fortunately wasn't very far.  So if you need a rental car with a pickup, call this location on Baseline.  Even though I had a car reserved at the Broadway location and had called for a ride, they never, ever called or came to my location to get me.  They lost out on what is now an over three month rental.  When it turned out I was going to be here for over a week this office switched me to a monthly rate which I have been on since I got here . I noticed they didn't have very good reviews and I mention that to the manager, Dustin. He told me he had just become the manager 2 weeks earlier and that things were improving, which I can totally concur with. I've been in a couple times to renew the car for my  extended visit and have encountered nothing but cheerfulness, helpfulness and efficiency on each visit. They have kept in good communication, calling to remind me when I need to go in.   When my credit card expired and I had to get a new one they were patient and waited a day or two to charge me.   If I encounter any problems when I turn the car in I will update this but so far, all is good!

Woo-hoo!  They're open!  Now I can get my Detroit food fix in Arizona!  First thing you see when you walk in is the decor and employees are all in Detroit colors, orange and blue.  You can buy the t-shirts too I think.  The menu is pretty simple, burgers and dogs. Pita sandwiches and salads, fries, chips and drinks.  They have several flavors of Faygo soda pop for $2.25 and bags of Better Made Potato Chips.  There is no Sanders Hot Fudge or ice cream of any kind.  No desserts that I saw at all.  I ordered the regular Coney Dog, $3.95 which came with Chili and onions, an order of the hand cut French fries to split, and Faygo ("Which way diddee go!?") Root Beer.  My daughter got a Breaded Chicken Tenderloin "Hani" Pita Sandwich and also a root beer.  The minute I bit into a French fry and tasted how delicious it was, I walked up to the counter, told the guy, "I'm not sharing those so we'd better get another order!". They tasted like my Mother's homemade ones!   The Coney Dog looked a little small on first view, but I bit into the hot dog and it almost audibly popped! Scrumptious juices exuded from it.  This is no ordinary hot dog.  Warning: It's messy.    The root beer bottle was kind of tepid, not ice cold, maybe just because they had such a rush of business on Opening Day that they couldn't keep up with the demand? I took my water glass, filled with ice and poured the drink over it, solving the problem.    The owner is very nice.  He and all the employees are all from various parts of Michigan.  I'm from Livonia, suburb of Detroit, myself.  I had heard about this Grand Opening at another Detroit themed place, Sunshine Motor City Cafe, and I think it is great that we ex-Michiganders have more than one place now to go get that back-home feeling, even if it is 113° outside!

This Dollar Tree is in the same center as the Wal-Mart and Goodwill but over on the other side.  I might not have found it if I hadn't seen the bright green letters across the parking lot and through some tree branches.  It isn't one of the bigger ones but had some of the things I needed.  I only spent $4.  It was the second DT of three I went to this day.  It is very well kept up and the clerk was pleasant.

I had a good experience at this office.  They got me in and out in about an hour and a half.  I needed to apply for my Social Security benefits and Medicare, having turned 65, and I was away from my hometown of San Diego.  I had tried to do it online but was told I didn't qualify for that method.  I tried to do it by phone and that didn't work either, so I justwent to this office which was only about a mile from where I was staying I only had about a 15 minute wait when I got there, even with no appointment.  An hour and a half after I walked in the door I walked out fully qualified for Social Security and Medicare. What more could you ask for? Very efficient.

There is nothing fancy about this Goodwill but I always find good stuff here.  Their prices are moderate--not overly high nor super cheap.  A couple trips I've found more than the usual amount of yarn here but as with everything else it's  the luck of the of the draw.  They seem to have fewer men's T shirts than the other stores. It's a somewhat smaller store so their aisles can get pretty crowded and narrow. The clerks have been especially nice when I needed help.  I mainly come on half priced Saturday's.

The staff are very knowledgeable and helpful.  They carry much better quality of yarn and supplies than the chain stores but the cost is higher, too.  They have classes and will help you if you take a project in you are working on.  I think they have knitting groups as well.  Oh, and I love stores with especially good lighting, natural or other!  My poor old eyes need all the help they can get!    Be sure to look around at all the pretty samples to inspire you!

This little cafe/Deli counter is inside the American Discount Grocery store and I have eaten here 3 times now with good success. The first time I got a chicken salad sandwich that was stuffed full and delicious and good quality. The second time I went with my daughter and tried the hot dog and she got a burger plate.  The 3rd time I made it over there by 11 o'clock so I could try their breakfast. All three times the meal was delicious, the food was well prepared, and the price was excellent. I can easily see how if you have the time, you could stop and have a breakfast, lunch or even dinner combined with a grocery stop to buy some of their budget priced groceries.    The breakfast especially impressed me.  Items are a dollar each, you just choose.  2 eggs, 2 bacon, potatoes, French toast, pancakes, make your own combo.  And they grind their own coffee.  I had bacon, eggs, potatoes AND a 12 oz glass of OJ for $4.  Can't beat that!

When my daughter and I drove past where I thought the Michaels was I couldn't find it and then I saw it on the other side of the street.   That was very confusing. "Hey, I thought it was on the other side," I said to my daughter. When I went back another day I was sure that it was a different location so I asked one of the clerks and sure enough they had moved to the new location.  I can't say for sure but the store does look bigger and of course everything was super organized and nice n clean looking, one of the nicest Michaels I have ever been in. The merchandise was the same, it just looked better.  The employees seem to be happy--I'm sure it is enjoyable to work in a brand new store .   One thing I like about this Michaels is that there's a Joanns and a Hobby Lobby nearby so you can hit the "Big Three" all in one trip to use your coupons.  Yay!

This is the Goodwill store that used to be around the corner in the same shopping mall but with the McClintock address. I believe it moved about a year ago to this location which is a larger store.  I've actually had pretty good luck at this Goodwill recently.  I've been here on previous trips and have come in 3 or 4 different times this trip.  I always find some things that I can use or that I like. It's not the closest one to me but if I feel like driving that direction then I will stop by, especially on the 50 percent off Saturdays. One bonus is it is next to a Sprouts Market, the Arizona Art Supply store, and across the street from the Coldstone Ice Cream. This last time I was in here I stopped into the Outback restaurant for lunch, a place that I had never been to before.   The store seems to be clean and organized, as much as it can be with all the people that go through messing it up. The prices are not too bad, though all the Goodwills are not as reasonable as they used to be.  But on the half price Saturdays every other week you can really do well.

Evidently this was a place called Posh Nosh till 2007, then de la Cruz Bistro from 2008 till summer of 2012. Margaritas Grill just opened up about a week ago and I stopped in tonight because I was in the area and ready for a bite.  I had researched it for info and only found one review, on Urbanspoon, which said it was great and meals were priced reasonably at under $10. I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in AZ because I can get it so easily in San Diego but I'm always game to try a new place of any kind.  The menu is not extensive but has some delicious sounding choices, mostly seafood.  The prices were decidedly not under $10. Dinners were mostly $12 and up, even some of the appetizers were $12-13.  I got a dinner special that was not on the menu after my server told me about it. It was a tamales plate with rice and beans for $10. I am admittedly on somewhat of a budget since I'm just visiting, though long term, and usually just eat out once a day.  I decided to splurge a little and got a House Margarita for $5 too.  My waitress was great, very friendly and attentive, checking on me periodically to see if I needed anything.  A+ for service.  The pork tamales were really good.  They had a lime touch to them that gave them a nice tang, the meat was very tender.  They were pretty mild, which I liked, but some people might find them too bland for their taste if they like theirs spicier.    The beans were so good I was sorry there weren't more, they disappeared too fast.  They were the thinner style so what looked like a wide portion was really a bit small since they spread out.  They would have made a fantastic bean dip.  The rice was also very good, maybe some of the best rice I've had this trip.  The amount was appropriate.  The tamales were neither huge nor puny, just average.  I would say it was a meal worth the $10.  The lettuce wasn't awful, just not cold, crisp, fresh, or seasoned in any way.  It was chopped large like a salad yet had no dressing.  There was no sauce, salsa, sour cream, guac, cilantro etc to add a little variety to the plate.  The Margarita was very good, didn't seem real strong, but I wouldn't have wanted it to be since I was driving.  It had a nice balance.  If I were to make a suggestion it would be to include a dollop of sour cream and maybe even a bit of guacamole and salsa to make it more interesting, and increase the portion of beans. Beans are cheap, you might as well be generous.   It was a bit dark for photography but I did get a few pics which I have posted.  The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, though.  I would say if you're in the area and hungry, this would be a solid place to eat. If I get back next trip I think I'll try one if the seafood dishes. I almost got the tilapia fish tacos tonight.

This is a nice Thrift Store in the shopping center where the Big Lots, Walgreen and Dollar Tree are, Fiesta Village I think.  It's much bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside.  The merchandise is pretty decent but like most thrift stores these days it is a little on the high side. Things are organized and clean except when people allow their kids to wreak havoc making a mess, breaking things, ripping open bags and losing the pieces to games and toys.  I finally spoke to a clerk about it last time I was there.   Me: Who wants to be the "Crabby Old Lady of the Day??"  Me: ME!!! (Raises hand high!)  Then I proceeded to let them know, nicely,  that it was unsafe for all those toys etc to be strewn over the aisles where a nice old person who was a real customer was trying to walk. And that they are losing money on the broken and lost items. They were totally sympathetic and let it be known they agreed with me but couldn't do much about it due to liability or fear of being sued or whatever.    However, the employee went over and spoke to the kids in Spanish and resolved the problem.  Hopefully he was telling them that the Bruja over there was going to come eat their eyeballs out at night while they were sleeping if they didn't cut it out.    If I can ever remember to go on a Wednesday, that's Senior Day, 50% off.  They have different color tags on sale every day and certain catagories, like 30% off kids clothes on Thursdays.  I haven't gotten into the habit of going often enough to memorize these.

Fiesta Village was a dying center until Walgreen and Big Lots went in, so while I'd rather see more mom and pop stores, I'm glad those stores and this new Dollar Tree opened up to make the center come alive again.  I think it opened in November and I've been coming here since about two weeks after they opened.  When you are visiting an area it's nice to have a dollar store nearby to provide you with basic supplies like paper towels, Kleenex, cleaning products, etc.  I usually come in for one specific item and end up Ieaving with $5-10 worth of other stuff.  Oh, yeah, I need bandaids, and lotion, and a plastic container, and some nail polish remover.  I don't need to spend hours pouring over products deciding which one is the most economical, they all cost the same.  At this particular location I have been highly impressed with the manager, at least I think he's the manager.  He always seems to be there and goes out of his way to greet people and help them find what they need.   He makes sure the store is always clean and organized, too. That's the kind of attitude that will keep people coming back!

I stopped in here yesterday looking for Gigi's BBQ which had previously occupied this space and found out that Gigi's is gone and Johnny has taken over the space.  He's about as friendly a guy as you'd like to meet and takes his food seriously.  He said he cooks everything like he's cooking it for himself.  He showed me the huge package of meat he makes the fresh burgers from and a potato the size of a football.  I got a cheeseburger with fries and even though the burger was huge I ate the whole thing. The burgers are steamed on the grill to keep the moisture in and let the fat out.  This makes it a burger that isn't as greasy and heavy as usual. Everything was as good as my mother would make.  He gave me a sample of chili and if you like yours with a burn you'll love this.  I like mine a little milder but that's just what I learned to like in early life.    If you need late night food he's open late weekend nights.  And if you're a student at Chandler High there's a special menu for students.  Both the regular menu and the student menu are written on the wall to your right as you walk in.  If you're in doubt if he's there just drive by and look for the OPEN sign in the window.  If it's lit, he's there.

The car was on empty and we were heading out to a Halloween Fair about 8 miles away so we stopped here for gas since it was on the way.  According to GasBuddy their gas prices were in the lower price range. Today it was $2.87 a gallon and I was afraid maybe that was a cash only price but it turned out to be the real price even with a credit card so I filled up . Except for a little problem of glare on the computer screen making it hard to read, the overall experience was fast and easy and we got out of there with no problems. I would not hesitate to stop at the station again if I'm in the area. I did not see the inside of the store since I was using the pay machine outside.

Well I guess my karma came back to me last night, at least that's what I would like to think. I pulled into the parking lot of this new Smashburger to meet my daughter so we could carpool to Savers Thrift Store for their half off Labor Day sale. We were to meet at Elliot and 101 and this was about the only place close to the freeway with a parking lot that was easy to find. There just aren't a lot of businesses around here--no gas stations or drugstores etc. This turned out to be fortuitous.  I parked and waited for my daughter to arrive. When I got out of the car to wave to her to show her where I was, a nice young man, who I later found out was Mike, asked if we were planning to come in to Smashburgers. I told him that I had planned to ask my daughter if she wanted to grab a bite to eat there and he said that actually they weren't opening until Wednesday but tonight they were having their Friends and Family Night starting at five and if we would like to join them we were welcome to!  I told him that we would love to if we got back in time and made sure it would be okay for my daughter to leave her car there while we were gone . He said that would be fine but suggested she park it at a little further back in the lot, so she did.  We got back to the area around 6 and went into the restaurant, which was fairly full but still had a few tables left, went to the counter and I ordered a Smashburger with goat cheese, arugula lettuce, cucumber, and Apple cured bacon with a side of their Haystack Onion Rings. My daughter got her favorite, a bacon cheeseburger, with a side of fries.   They gave us each a cup for a drink. I got some vitamin water that was acai and pomegranate flavored. Periodically a girl walked around with a tray full of sample size cups of milkshakes.  During the course of the evening we were able to taste vanilla, Oreo, and chocolate.  All were creamy and good.  The burgers were delicious with what was obviously real meat, no filling, and all the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  The French fries I thought were just sort of average but the onion rings were absolutely heavenly. They were thread thin and crispy and so delicate they practically fell apart when you picked them up.  I loved them!  I would come back for another burger and more of those onion rings at the drop of a hat. The burger was cooked well done, which I know they have to do, though I do prefer mine a little pink in the middle. But the texture and flavor of the burger were perfect.  There was no gristly chewiness, just good quality meat . I would say the service was good though they were naturally very busy and didn't get back to check on us very often. However we didn't need anything other than a second sample of milkshake so we were fine.  They even brought us an extra hamburger by mistake but let us keep it and brought a to go box, which I thought was very nice.  All in all it was a very nice evening. We enjoyed ourselves immensely, got a big kick out of getting a free meal that was delicious, and I plan to go back.  I can recommend this place with a clear conscience.

This is one of my favorite little places to stop and relax, have a bite to eat or just a cold drink.  A few years ago there was a little deli counter here that I loved and I was so disappointed when I found out they had closed.  Then when I came in to get my own library card in April I saw there was a new cafe again!  This is a non-profit business that benefits an organization that provides job training for women and helps them with domestic violence, sexual assault and substance abuse issues including housing, support groups, medical and legal assistance. All the workers are volunteers as I understand it.  There is even a gift shop to help raise money for the cause.  All right there on the library premises where you can stop by before or after you check out your materials.  Not only are the volunteers cheerful and helpful but the food is delicious! My favorite is the chicken salad sandwich, followed close by the tuna salad.  They serve a variety of coffees and smoothies, a few simple breakfast items and desserts, snow cones, Italian sodas (which I usually get) Frappes, etc.  There is usually a Daily Special and you can get a combo with  chips and drink.  Everything I've had here was wonderful.    There is another location of Cup O'Karma up in Mesa on Southern, too.

This is a relatively new place in the area.  I've been here about 4-5 times now and food has been good every time.  I've had tacos, I've had the biryani which is a goat stew, I've had chilaquiles, I've had ceviche, and everything has been delicious so far.  The ladies who run the place are very nice and it's a real asset to the neighborhood to have them here. This is probably the closest little restaurant of any kind to where I live, which makes it very convenient, and the food is better quality then KFC, Church's Chicken or the other fast food places nearby.  Their condiments have been nice and fresh every time, too.  I'mma keep comin' back!  PS--bring cash, no cards here.
