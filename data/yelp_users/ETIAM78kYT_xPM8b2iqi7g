If I could give a 0 star, I would.  This tribe has no respect for those who don't smoke.  There is not ONE single non-smoking area in the whole place....not even in their Cholla fine dining restaurant (see separate review) which is a definite 4 star.  Never again!

What do I do?  I had a fine experience...sat at the bar on a Wed at 12:30. no wait.  Great service, as others have noted.  Very good sashimi deluxe (whiteboard special) two rolls from the luncheon specials.  Price $25 plus drinks.  Nothing was bland, everything tasted good and fresh.  I was ready to give this place a 5, but too many of you say I'm wrong.  I know...I'll have to go back again to get a better outlook on Sakana.  In the meantime, maybe I'll sneak in a few times without reviewing.  Just to keep my tasting skills up.

Ok...took three friends to a Saturday evening dinner.  Note the 5 stars - Sakana is one of the best, if not the best, on the northwest side.  Wait staff is great, noise level and music are just right, prices are just what I'd expect.  And the serving sizes are perfect!

So we went back for the Veal.  Very good - could have been worked on a bit more - there was a bit of chewiness throughout.  But the Sauce was really good.  I'd have said a three again, if it wasn't for the sauce and that incredible waitress!!!  And I found out she's not Italian - hope Fiorella pays her well, I tipped her well, she's absolutely unbelieveable and never acts flustered.  And I love the neighborhood atmosphere!

Sorry, folks...this is another Peoria/Surprise/Glendale pizza place I can take off my list.  Went there tonight - eat in - ordered a pepperoni & onion pizza.  I should have been concerned when it arrived and the pieces wouldn't break apart - with a kitchen knife and fork we were just barely able to cut them apart.  First bite...the crust was doughy and chewy and tasted strongly of flour. Long story short, the girl asked how things were, as she saw us eating the toppings and leaving the crust.  We told her of the crust and her response was "Sorry."  I can't explain the 5 stars vs my one star, all I know is what the pizza was tonight.  Never, ever, again.

Crowded...jammed....packed...?  Must have been in the good ole days.  Went on a Saturday at 12:45 and the place was 25% full.  Well, maybe that because the corporate recipe chef left out spices, herbs, butter, flavor buds, real food, salt and pepper, etc.  In nother words - no flavor folks!  Gave em a 2 since they serve Coke instead of Pepsi.  The cookie gal walked right by us...that almost got them a 1, but I figured the cookies were probably bland, too.

I'm impressed!  Sometimes you wonder about a business that has few reviews - all of them 5star.  But I have to tell you, Moore took care of my new Chevy Equinox's real tailgate just as they promised, for the price promised and on time!  Can't get any better than that.  Their office manager, Kellie, was really easy to work with and my car was returned to me all cleaned and shiny inside and out.  I don't want to need their services again, but if I do, there's no question where I'd go!  Moore's!

Three couples for dinner on Father's Day.  First impression - a beauticully done atmosphere.  The bar/lounge area just invites you to sit down.  So we did - 8 oz pinot grigio and 8 oz  chardonnay (house) = $23.  Huh?  So I started out with a bit of a chip on the shoulder - house wines should never be that high, and these were unknown brands.  And I kind think offering a choice of 5 oz or 8 oz is unneeded. Go with an 8 oz, get the price into the $7-$9 range for the house.  Ok...now we went to the dining room.  Very nice.   This place is so like a hunting lodge in the north woods.  Great waitress and good service.  And the food was excellent and the prices were on the high side, but not upsetting at all.  By the way...go for either one of the salmons...or for a huge salad..  I'll vouch for all of them.  Wish the filet was a little more juicy - it was med rare and plenty of red, but not much juice.  If you order the spinach side, be sure to ask they go lighter on the garlic!  So now, the score.  I'll go with 4.  Still upset about the wine, but not enough to ding them.

If you can give Red Lobster a 4, I can Give Elephant a 10!  But seriously, for a chain restaurant, this is almost as good as it gets.  I like their ahi tuna....had their Mongolian beef today which was good (notice I did not say very) and Jo had the parmesan chicken which she thought was very moist and good.  Wait staff is almost always very attentive.  Happy hour prices are good, and the bar menu is very good.  If I was comparing this to a locally owned, great restaurant, this would be a 3.5. - but on Yelp, as a chain, I don't mind stretching.

Another four star!  We had the 10" gyros at $5.99 each.  Not the best I've had, but very good.  They could have had a bit more lamb and a little less beef to make them super.  But a very good bite.  Everybody's plate looked good - and yes, the place was packed and stayed that way.  We must have been lucky - very good service, very attentive young people at the cash register.  In fact, one made a trail around the dining room asking how poeple liked their food And clean!  Even the bathroom was clean!

Been back 3-4 times this year.  And discovered the gyros wrap.  Great!  This place if fine - only one thing keeps them from 5 stars in my book, and that's their Greek salad.  The dressing needs a real improvement. Try the restaurant at Happy Valley and 67th to see what I mean.  But back to Greek Wrap....the people are Great!  The gyros meat is delicious.  Lots of pride in the place and it shows.  Even when they're busy at lunch, they keep the tables and the floor clean.

A Geico customer hit our car and was responsible.  Geico sent us to Larry Miller in Glendale. (I really wanted to go to Moore in Glendale)    I was told by Geico to call and get an appointment time.  I was amazed at the fine  reception.  Upon arrival, a Geico man met me and checked the damage.  All of 10 minutes and one cup of comp coffee.  He sent me over to the on-site Enterprise and Geico, as promised, took care of my rental car (However, Enterprise was slow as hell in having the promised car available - couldn't even find the Geico request????). So this is 4 stars for Geico and Miller! My only complaint - the repair took 10 working days - most of which was waiting for parts.  My car was very driveable.  So why did I have to leave my own car and drive the very poor Enterprise Car? BTW, 2 stars for the Enterprise portion!

After  a year in the West Valley, this is by far the best mexican restaurant we've found.  We've had friendly, good service and very tasty food.  But one major complaint - they make the sweetest margaritas I've ever tasted.  And I didn't think margaritas were supposed to be sweet.  Next time, I'll follow another reviewer and order beer!

Decided to try the Costco buying plan.  They gave me the choice from a few dealers and I picked Power in Oct, 2012.  The nicest experience of car buying I've ever had.  Saul Aguirre was my "salesman" and he made everything smooth and easy. Now....eight months later and I've used their service facility twice - once for an oil and service and last week for a bluetooth problem.  Service techs were John and Mike.  Both were thorough and the car was taken in on time and the service was performed in the time they stated. I don't know how this doesn't qualify for 5 stars! Oh, and I love my 2013 Equinox.

OK, now I've been her 3 times for service (covered in the purchase) and they are still remarkable.  Make an appointment and they are ON TIME and my car has been done before I expected.  And their waiting room is great. (Com'on guys, you need a whole bunch of new magazines.)  Will I go back, because my freebies are done?  I don't know........because I know dealers are expensive.  I'll let you know.

This is a breakfast review.  Found ourselves at the Metro at 9:30am and store not open till 10.  So we went searching  for a breakfast place and found very slim pickings....down to Mimi's and this unknown Mexican place in a 70% empty shopping center.  Wow, we both said "A hidden jewel!"  Maybe we like less spicy than some of you, but we gave our ham and eggs burrito and omelet ranchereo high marks.  Very flavorful.  Big helpings and excellent pricing. Now we need to try it for lunch - we can't believe it goes down to a 2 or 3 star!  And btw, the place was very clean and our waitress was excellent!

First the negative (notice the singular).  Forget the chowder...way too much flour and not well flavored!  My wife would be happy to help them here!  Now the positives.  First, Cathy is one of the waitresses we love - the old fashioned kind that enjoys customers.  And the food -  forget all these New England experts.  We're from Fall River and the full-belly clams were great!  Fried shrimp were delicious, scallops were fine and the cod was huge and done just right...not all wet inside like we're used to here in Phoenix.    I'm not going to go on -- we'll go back!!

Why don't good restaurants stay good?  Why do the seem to disappoint once you've raved about them?  Loved Taylors the first two trips.  And tonight, the fried clams were soft and soggy (you could taste the flour or whatever they were dipped in) and clams are supposrd to be crisp.  My wife, who is from the coast of Massachusetts and introduced me to belly clams could not eat here.  So we sent them back and guess what....they came back fried just the same.  Sorry Taylors....I really thougnt we'd found a new seafood favorite!

And this time we caught a downer.  The brisket was almost pure fat.  Tasty, but fat.  To be fair, they took it off our bill.  But they should never have sent it out of the kitchen.  Maybe their up and down quality explains why they were almost empty at 1pm on a Saturday

OMG, a landscaping company?  Why not, because Keven's deserves the recognition.  OK, new home, original landscaping done by one of the big names. Pretty expensive, pretty ordinary results.  Keven sent out a mailing to our neighborhood, and we liked the way it looked, so we called them when we were ready to fix things up in the back (more and better plants, a waterfall, fire pit, some pavers, etc. One of their designers, John, came out and we discussed our ideas.  Within a week he was back with detailed plans and prices.  The pricing was very good and the results were fantastic.  And John followed the job, always available when we had a question or concern. Lots of neighbors said ours was the best backyard around. But the important part (at least to us) - they followed up...they adjusted water flow, they checked irrigation lines that weren't working (including some put in by the big name).  Their superintendent, Dave, made sure we were happy and everything was working to our satisfaction - checking even three months after the job was done. We recommend them highly.

Two years later, and I'd give them a two....maybe a one.  A year after the fountain was built, it started leaking.  Keven's did not stand behind their work - blamed the leak on irrigation and anything else they could think of.  We spent almost a year and 100's of dollars and were finally assured that the leak was fixed.  Well it wasn't and I'm stuck.Keven's won't turn their hand without getting paid and I can't use my beautiful fountain and I just can't justify spending more money with them.  Bad experience and I just don't feel they treat customers right.  Great in front, very weak on guarantee and service

Kevens deserves an update.  I told you in the last review that Keven said he was going to make it right.  Well, he did - in less than one week!  Now my waterfall is beautiful again.  Too bad we had to wait so long before Keven learned of our problems -- better communication in the office seems needed.  But my waterfall and Keven's taking care of it gets my original 5 stars back again.  Thanks, Keven.

What a find for a good old American Breakfast!  Right at Bell and 99th Ave. We went for breakfast, but their lunch/dinner menu looks pretty good too - the place ought to be featured in Diners, Driveins and Dives - tho this is certainly not a dive.  I had country fried steak (made with certified Angus Beef) with sausage gravy, two eggs, fresh fruit (or hash browns) and toast for $7.99.  Jo-Ann was more conservative - two eggs. toast and hashed browns for $3.99 ($1 more on the weekend, I think).  The food was excellent.  Nothing fancy, just good food with decent serving size at a great price.  Some lunch/dinner choices - 1/3 lb Angus Beef cheeseburger for $5.49, Chicken Cordon Bleu with sides for $8.99, Fish & Chips for $7.49.  I'm ready to go back!  And don't let the "Sun City" stop you - this morning the ages were all over the place from teens to seniors.

I was wrong - they've just raised prices, not just for the winter.  Still, regular haircut is $9.  Not bad at all!  I've tried three of the four barbers so far - you can't go wrong.  Just take a number when you go in the door.  First chair is JJ, second is Robert, fourth is Bob.

OMG, I'm the first to review this place.  My accountant is nearby, so we stopped here for breakfast.  Let's just say I won't be going back - for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts?  Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra?  Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.  It's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling!  Time for another dose of Pepto!

You know what?  This is a great neigborhood bar with decent food.  Not a fine dining establishment.  So love it for what it is.  Very good drinks - and have 'em in the bar....forget the dining room - mix with the regulars.  Have some nachos, or a burrito.  But realize you're there for fun, not for 5 stars.  The beer's cold, the margs are smooth and the help, with one exception are pretty damn nice. (one's a little pushy going for extra sales)  So why only 4 stars?  Because it's not and never will be, a 5 star place.  Go there to relax and enjoy and meet all the trades guys (who knows, you may find a guy that can fix your sink) and the neighbors.  If I owned a place, I'd want it to be just like this!

Sorry, this place has really gone downhill.  Food is still just average, but the drinks are almost worthless.  Went yesterday for a late lunch and tried three different Margaritas and none were any good,  Sorry, Top Shelf, after 7 years or so of regular visits, you're off our list.  The average food just doesn't make up for the lousy drinks

Sorry, just not my kind of place.  Love Triple D, and I've gone to a number of Guy's places.  But Campbell's isn't DD&D material and never will be - way too small a meat pattie in the hamburger - a cook/cashier/clean up guy (oops, no one told him that) behind a really improvised "kitchen counter" - dry bun - soda machines that take space but don't work.  Almost made us want to go back to Lakeside Grill.

Sorry to see mixed reviews....our two visits last week were great! Four of us, waiter was Roger - been there 10 years and he was very good.  Osso Buco and saltimbucco....calamari and the veal marsala...all very good.  My wife thought the accompanying alfredo was the best she'd ever had.   Second night, water was Vito, also excellent.  And again, all four meals were excellent.  I asked for pomodoro instead of the alfredo side and that was disappointing - tomatos were canned and I could't taste or see the garlic.  But as a side dish, that sure did not ruin the evening at all. We didn't get to try a dessert - too full both nights.  And the Thursday visit included a piano plyer with "lounge" type music.  Far from the best - real far. So we've got a new go-to in Vegas.  And it was extra nice to get off the strip (about 3 miles south of Mandalay Bay).  Oh, they're open 24/7!!!!

Finally!  A Chinese restaurant on the west side that's really good!  Understand they've been here a year - on a Saturday night at 6:30pm they were packed - at 7:15pm, they were practically empty.  Now you know when to arrive. Jo had Asparagas with Chicken and Shrimp, I had Kung Pao Beef...both excellent.  The spring rolls were very tasty. I'd consider 5 stars except for the waiter - too much of a hurry, put down the spring rolls without sauce or mustard, never asked if we wanted anything.  I watched other waiters and they were much more thorough, so we just caught a poor one. Go back again?  For sure!

A 4 or a 5?  Lunch today was a 4 - mainly because my shredded beef taco was just way too soggy.  But 90% of the lunches and dinners here are 5's.  Great house margaritas! Excellent salsa/bean dip choices. Waitress Sammie was a delight.  And we'll definitely go back because we know next time will be a 5!  Oh, after lunch, stop and check out the Western Museum downtown.  Absolutely a Gem!!

As a recent transplant from Kaiser in Woodland Hills, Calif (where I was very pleased with the hospital and care)....well this is a big step above.

We're from the other side of town, but met some California friends here after looking for a good pub!  All four of us had a very good experience. Jo and I split the Wally Burger and the Gruyere and Slab Bacon Mac.  Ryan W. was spot on - excellent s'mac!! Burger was good, but so juicy the bun just had to be set aside.  One friend had soup of the day with a burger.  Said the soup was wonderful!  Loved the atmosphere and the service.  We'll be back!

Looks like a sports bar, sounds like a sports bar, must be a sports bar.  Not a restaurant/bar.  We had the cobb salad.  Safeway mixed greens, MAYBE one slice of bacon, one egg, lots of black olives, lots of dry chicken chunks...dry!!  Some bleu Cheese "crumbles" and what they call bleu cheese dressing. Price was ok.  Salad was SAD!  I won't go back, but if you decide to, try the hamburger.

What can you say when you're the 112th to review?  I agree with the above?  Four of us for lunch.  Arrived at one and got a table right away.  Nice Waiter, but he did forget we need silverware and napkins.  Nice menu.  I chose the Italian Stallion and it was excellent - except - what happened to the crisp crust I heard about?  Mine was greasy and chewy.  But the flavor of the pie was excellent. Sorry -1 for that crust.  My wife had the Margarita with the homemade mozzarella.  Loved it, except for her crust, as well.  Female friend had a calzone and said it was the best she's had since she was 11 years old in New Jersey!!  Her husband had a Margarita with prociutto and loved every bite.  No complaint about the crust.    And THEN....we had an order of zeppolis (balls of fried pizza dough deep-fried and covered with powdered sugar) and guess what....it was the best she's had since she was 11 in New Jersey!!  Guess if you're from Jersey, you'll love this place.  Would I drive here again.  You bet; I'd just ask for the crisp crust version.  Then it will be 5 stars!!

I'm impressed!  We walked in the door three weeks later and the waiter said "Welcome Back!".  Huh? In the United States?  Customer Service to the top?   Plus he remembered the Sangiovese we'd liked.  I'm just not used to this. Plus the owner's son stopped by to check on everything!  In a pizza parlor? C'omon  Oh, the pizza?  I forgot the most important part.  Great!  Thin Crust!  San Marzano tomatoes. Fresh mozzarello. Excellent....  You know, I'm probably not spelling these words right cuz I've never seen them on a pizza menu before

Been there, done that.  Fair sandwiches (better than Safeway, anyway).  Only 2 stars since I didn't know about the free soft serve, so didn't get to try that.  There's gotta be a good New York-style deli west of the 17 and north of Thunderbird.  Isn't there?  Doesn't have to be great.  Good would be wonderful.

This certainly isn't the classy looking restaurant shown on the website.  Surprise is smaller, much brighter and noisy!  But the food was delicious.  Three Cheeses Mac and Cheese was wonderful  And my wife loved the Pomodoro Pasta.  She requested lots of capers, and she got it (fifty cents extra). Nothing fancy - no veal, darn it - but lots of different pastas and salads.  You could go for a month and never have the same dish.  As another reviewer said, a nice little local joint.

It's not about the food - the food is ok.  Not bad....tasty, but just okay.  And the menu allows plenty of choices.  It's not about the show.  Because they're okay, too.  We saw "Bye, Bye Birdie."  And it was okay.  So I guess it's really about the entire evening.  Arizona Broadway Theatre makes for a fun evening.  Not something you're going to be talking about for a week.  But definitely a place you can go back to and enjoy.

I know, you're expecting a bloody fine review for a true "Irish" pub.  Sorry, Lis doon varna doesn't get it from me. !) too cutesy a name...2) a so-so Irish menu.  The fish and chips was pure USA.  3)The wait staff is poorly trained - and we've been there twice and experienced the same service both times. 4) That's not surprising, having met a very poor people-person posing as a manager.  In Ireland (been there 5 times for 13 weeks total) the better publican is usually a very good politician, greeter, kidder....the kind of person that makes you want to come back tomorrow.  But Phoenix is not an Irish town, so I'll keep looking without expecting much.  Oh, Kevin, you're so right.  Absolutely no soul!!!!

We've eaten there twice, with two different servers, and I'd give four stars each time.  They've got a great bar with very friendly bartenders.  Haven't tried any appetizers, but we've had the Delmonico steak (done just right at medium rare) and the crab claws - delicious.  I think the crab claws are now also available as an appetizer.  Wine list is a little light (the owner told me he was trying to keep the wines at a reasonable price point, and he has, but he could still add some more to the list) and the prices are a bit high, but still about what I expected to pay at a good steak house.  We'll definitely go back

Third trip was fantastic.  Four steaks done just perfect.  Very good salad and a waitress who has served us twice and I'll ask for her by name next time.  My only fear is that this tough economy has got to be bad for a quality restaurant....gotta hope Charles can hold out!  Did I tell you he tries to greet guests as they enter or leave?

Okay, Charles (the chef/owner- and extremely good at greeting, visiting with customers), you've got me.  Went there last Wed evening with friends from No Calif.  Four great dinners.  WOW!  Meat was done just right, two filets, two Delmonicos.  Jeff the server was fine and attentive without being a pain.  A great experience.  Now we'e going to try the bar menu or the lunch menu..  And the word is getting out - for a Wed, they were fairly busy.  Better call for a reservation on weekends.

My wife loves their pizza, so there's four stars automatically.  But that's where we stop.  Too much inter-employee BS going on and not enough looking after the customer.  And the floor manager (guess that's what he was, he sure wasn't helping anybody) needs to go to attitude school.  We were lucky - very nice waitress.  But you have to wonder when she's talking to the table next to us, telling them she's looking for another job where she can make some money.  And, oh, yeah...they're believers in the "use a tiny carafe to serve the wine - it looks like they're getting more" school.

Third time's a charm?  Not in this case.  We gave it a better than normal chance and they blew it almost every time.  Poor (or no) service 2 out of three times.  Although the bus guy from England is very helpful.  Food? Six meals - one fish and chips not bad, but the next time that was horrible too.  Price?  Dollar meal specials would be too high.  Choose Chili's.

You know, sometimes you just forget where you bought that pair of slacks that fits so good.  And sometimes you forget what an awful experience you had at a restaurant last time.  That's us...so fourth time is a never, ever again.  NEVER!  Friday night...fish and chips.  We love fish and chips!  NEVER, ever again.

The West Valley really needs a good sushi bar.  But Blu isn't it.  Went for lunch with my sushi buddy.  Neither one of us was impressed.  It's kinda barren, cold, sterile looking.  I don't think our waitress ever tasted sreal sushi in her life.  The sushi chef never acted like he understood a thing we ordered - and I ordered one of their lunch specials.  He screwed it up and the manager got me the right thing, plus whatever it was he made by mistake was free.  Good thing, it wasn't very good and we couldn't understand what the chef said it was.  Another place to take off my list!

First visit, and on a Friday night, and it was a very good experience.  We had reservations that got messed up...the manager brought us an appetizer plate, on the house, while we waited at the bar.  Not a bad wait - one glass of wine...and we had a nice table around the corner from the jazz duo.  Nice background music.  I'd always been warned about their wine, and I do like wine.  Had their Reserve Chard and was pleasantly surprised, my wife had Viognier and switched to my Chard and my buddy had Reserve Cab which he liked...his girlfriend had white zin.  Oh, the food...very good, well prepared and seasoned and we all were very pleased.  Fine, very friendly service.  Add to our back again list.  But I'll go a bit later.  Go about 7:30 and the early crowd with the accompanying noise, is gone and things are a lot more relaxed.

Thought I should tell you.  My wife and a bunch of the neighborhood gals went there last nite on the "Girls Night Out" and raved about the food and the service.  My wife recommended the Reserve wines and those who ordered wine likede the Reserve.  They got the front group room and thought it was just perfect - they could talk without the noise of the main dining room and they had a great waitress.  Definite (Return To).

I like Yard House.  Have gone to Desert Ridge in the past - my first time at Westgate.  Gret server.  Appetizer was very slow in arriving (think the kitchen just missed the order) and it was comped without us saying a thing.  Four of us tried some new (for us) items and we were all pleased.  Three different salads - all very good, plus a Gorgonzola burger (very good).

Jo said she just needed a newspaper wrapping and she would have been in Dublin.  Well, I think that's a bit exagerrated.   First, sorry to all you chowder lovers, but this would never make it in New England.  Too thick with flour.  Never again. Catfish - wonderful.  4.5 star, for sure.  Thin crust...just like it should be.  Fine piece of fish. Fries - excellent.  Not english style - more like McDonalds, but they were good. Hush puppies - forget it.  Throw 'em out.  Maybe if they provided lots of butter, but they don't. Service - fine.  We had a little confusion with the order.  I think the guy was a little new and I won't blame him....but in general, much better than you would expect in this type of casual place.  They could do a bit better cleaning off the tables between customers, but you know what?  That's a very minor complaint. Price - a bit high.  But we don't have much choice for good "chip shops" (as they say in Glasgow) do we?

Service was outstanding from the hostess to the waiter to the bus guys.  The food was wonderful...except I don't get the mac and cheese - it's mac and cheese - that's all. For an $11 side, I'd skip next time.  I'd also be careful of their wine list - very high and not as good a list of wines as the prices would suggest (Souverain Sauvignon Blanc retails for $14-16 per bottle, FGS). BUT, the food was wonderful - everything done properly and nicely plated.  Good experience.

I'm talking my Grandmother's good, old fashioned Italian!  If she'd been Italian.  Best lasagna we've ever tasted.  A very good linguine with a terrific spicy sausage sauce.  Typical no-name chianti by the glass or carafe.  And the Chicago style pizza looked wonderful - we'll try that next.  Or maybe the Cobb salad - the small size was huge.     As far as the crowd was concerned (and it was crowded), it was a mixed age group.  Sure, there were some in their 60's and 70's, but there were a number in their 30's and 40's.  Okay - none in their 20's, but they would not have felt out of place.  Anyway, if you like great, everyday Italian, Rosie's is my choice.  And Rosie sits by the front door.

It's a 35 minute drive for us, but I had to go back for the pizza, which we originally meant to try before we got into the lasagna and spicy sausage/pasta dishes.  We ordered a meatball and onion 12" for lunch.  Very thin crust.  Lots of meatballs and onions and served HOT.  Gotta be honest, it was better than any pizza we've had in Phoenix, but I'm still looking for one as good as Monical's used to serve in Illinois.  Next time I've got to try their Cobb salad.  The small is huge and we watched three salesmen devour three of them today!  Needless to say, This is one of our favorites for casual.

Very nice setting with inside and outside seating.  Full bar.  And the food can sometimes be ok.  But the service needs real work - last week it took 15 minutes from the time we arrived until the hostess appeared.  Thank goodness a waitress saw our plight.  But then the waitress got tied up with a table of family, or close friends, and we had trouble getting her attention.  The bread arrived just before we finished - just in time to sop up the juices on the plates.  We've eaten here 6-8 times and keep hoping.  For lunch it's ok, but dinner just isn't working for them yet.  That's obvious from the lack of crowds, except in the bar.

I have to tell you, the Manager Don is shaping this place up.  Service is much better....food more consistant.  My only concern is their buffets and they love buffets.  They're up and down.  But their pizza last night was great!  Drinks are always good.  And they seem to be using fresh food - not frozen.  We're going back more often!

Com'on, Don....this is supposed to be a country club.  Have you ever been to one?  Your wait staff (except for Joey) and your hostess obviously have NO training.  And where are you hiding???  I'm sorry - 71 Grille - brand new - wipes you out.  Beautiful location, views.......I was so excited by the way you took this place in hand and turned it around.  Are you still there?  By the way, tonight's pizza was cold and lousy!!!  I'm scared to come back again after this review!  Yelp.......You do not do your members a service by posting a 2011 review as first!

Again I'm surprised nobody has found this place.  Just 30 minutes from Sun City Grand (Ah, maybe that's why).  Absolutely GREAT stage shows like the Redneck Tenors, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Brubeck Brothers, Kathy Mattea, PLEASE, use this info for yourself and don't pass it on.  Because it's only a 600 seat place and there are no bad seats.  Believe me, NONE!  Call them or visit their website and GO!

Ok....my 2nd review of an "Irish" pub.  And we're getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff. Good Irish music (cd's) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So I'll keep looking, but I'll stop here when I'm in the neighborhood.

We went for lunch and arrived at 1:15pm.  One man at a table, one at the sushi bar just leaving.  While we were there, two girls came in, two guys came to the bar and one solo at the window.  So the crowd was pretty sparse. First - the service was fine.  The young lady had a rough time with English, but she really tried.  The two males were better on English.  And all of them checked on us every once in a while. The food was good...certainly not great.  It was obviously fresh.  I had the three rolls for $11 special, Jo had a Chicken Teriyaki Special for $11.  Chicken was a little on the dry side - she would have preferred dark meat.  My rolls were good and the price was fine. Their techno-pop music seemed way out of place, especially when they had the US Hockey Team on one TV. All in all, I'll go back.  But, do note that all the "Happy Hour Specials" require you to buy a beer or sake.  One drink for every special you order.  Ehhhhhh

Add another great experience.  Ariel and his wife are in their fifth year of owning a top-notch TV repair shop.   And with service like they provide, they're going to be around for a lot longer!  My seven year old Samsung was working again in just 20 minutes.  Plus Ariel was willing to do some rewiring on my DVD player while he was here.  We would recommend them to anyone

Irish Pub?  Gotta try it!  First time we went just for a drink.  They'd been open a week, so one pint of Harp wiped out their keg.  A pint of Murphy's Amber for me and we were both happy.  Good bartender - gal from Glasgow (that's a suburb of Dublin).  Friendly service, made sure we got to see their menu, told us about their Friday all-you-can-eat fish and chips, their Sunday 2-for-1 on traditional Irish breakfast and their unique sliders - corned beef and cheese on small rolls with dressing.  So today we went back for lunch.  Nice crowd and plenty of Harp (plus about 9 other beers on draft).  I had the fish and chips (not bad, but sorry, lads, I have had better - the fish sandwich is a better buy) and Jo had the sliders (very good). Chips were tasty and potatoey - just like in Ireland.  Slaw was very good.  Bill was $35 for lunch and four pints.  Not bad.  Most of their sandwishes were in the $7-$10 range including sides and their burger is 1/2 ponnd Angus beef.  We'll try the Sunday breakfast next and I'll let you know.  Slainte!

Finally found one!  A great sushi bar.  I'd heard that Fresh Wasabi was good - but it's pretty far down Bell Rd.  Well, this one was very good, brand new and at the corner of Bell and Grand - right across the parking lot from Home Depot.  What a selection - lots of rolls if you're a roll person.  But lots of sashimi and plain sushi as well.  A full sheet of lunch specials including some tempura boats, etc.  And the fish was excellent!  Wonderful Yellowtail, as a matter of fact.  Happy to see them out here, and I think you will be, too.

I don't give that many 5-stars.  I'd give this company a 6!  Very friendly, fast and as others said, they cleaned up so well I really don't think anyone was here.  Took a big sissou down in one hour (including cleanup).  Wow!

Just an echo.  Very fresh fish, good to great sauces, extensive menu (and they don't try to sell 50 different rolls, TG!)  My only compaint - not too major - is they cut their sashimi too chunky and make no effort to make it attractive (which I always thought was the sign of a real sushi chef).  We were impressed, altho Jo would like to see them add a couple of teriyake/tempura boat lunches.  She's not into sushi, but she was told to try the Vegas roll and she liked it!  Also the California, of course.  We'll go back - often

The four stars are for food!  One star for background music.  Loud Rap at 6:30 pm on a Friday?    For me, this place is for lunch only.  However, congrats to the chef....their sashimi is cut nicely now and served attractively.  So somebody is listening.  Not to the music, tho.

OK..this review is for the sushi side only!  Remember that...we did not experience the hibachi side.  To sum it up, we'll never go to Hayashi for sushi again.   We ordered a sashimi plate and it was very good - couple of pieces I sure didn't recognize, but all four servings were very good.  Then to the rolls - salmon skin rolls were not.  Not even according to the menu.  Neither was the hamashi (sp?) roll.  Both were not good, not made the way they were described and the seaweed was tough.  So that brings us to the spider roll.  It was ok, but the tough seaweed kinda took the fun away.  And the waitress was no help.  She admitted she didn't like fish and instead of taking care of replacement, she made 3-4 trips out to the sushi bar (if you go, don't sit in the back room) to get his side of the story.  Cream cheese in salmon skin roll...no sesame seeds on hamashi roll? What kind of fish was that?  Oh, red fish.  I understand. What's not to understand?  I'm still praying for a great sushi bar on the west side.

This has got to have changed hands??  Oh, Man...the lunch last week was excellent!  I had the sashimi lunch special and it was excellent!  Sat at the bar....and the barmaid didn't know s... about sushi (don't you people have a training program??)  But she was an excellent bartender and made our experience very comfortable.  Soooo glad I came back.  Maybe only for lunch?

Cave Creek Smokehouse and Pourhouse Patio.  Hard to keep up with this place - it was the Silver Spur a few months ago.  And it could be something else tomorrow.  The food's pretty standard - burgers, BBQ, steaks, chicken, blah blah, blah. Cowboy atmosphere, train yourself waitstaff (who easily get flustered), screaming children who want more popcorn..........  Good place for kids - it's in Frontiertown - so the sheriff rides thru on weekends.  Lady next door at the Visitor Center is very helpful about Cave Creek.

Mexican food chains tend towards "all the same with a different name."  That's where Ninfa's stands out.  Definitely not the same old!  We had marinated flank steak fajitas in Houston a few years ago and loved them.  So you know what we tried here.  Damn good - maybe not quite as good as our Texas experience, because this steak had a line of gristle running through.  But we'll do it again.  All the other reviewers are right - nice place, well-trained emplyees, clean, great food.  So why not 5 stars?  I don't know....I'll just have to try it again.

Well, still not a 5 star.  In fact, now I'm at about a 3.5.  Still gristle in the meat that made the fajita's hard to bite thru.  My wife says I've got to expect gristle in skirt steak.  Sorry, I want to be able to bite thru without a piece of steak pulling out of the fajita.   The meat flavor is excellent - great marinade. Our guests thought the chicken fajitas were wonderful.  And the margaritas were not as good as last time.  We were disappointed. Great service, really good service.  I'll keep the 4 stars for now, but I'm getting closer to 3.

Where do you eat in Wickenburg?  Lots of restaurants, dumps and joints, but Tumbleweeds tops them all - by far.  We went last night before the Del Webb performance - they were short handed and packed.  Lucky I had read Yelp and made reservations and our table was waiting.  Too bad every server was rushed...but our gal took great care of us, the food came out quickly and it was wonderful.  One order of Crabpot, one of Ribs without sauce and two of Beef Stew.  Stew absolutely needed more beef, but everything, including the stew tasted great!  Side salad was fine, with a few unexpected surprises and the "shot of dessert" was a very good chocolate cake.  Everything included in the price!  Plus a strolling cowboy singer who was pretty darn good (you can put a tip right in his guitar and we loved him)!  They made lots of apologies for being rushed.....but they sure didn't need to - they took care of everybody just fine.  Damn, I'm tempted to give them a 5.

Still a 4 star.  Fried chicken was too soggy - not at all crispy.  Great staff, usually good drinks, always a great "shot of dessert" to finish the meal.  The food just needs a little more attention.

Sorry, but the second try did this place in as far as we're concerned.  Slow, slow kitchen.  The "Burro" was eh - good meat but poorly flavored filling.  The "cowboy" beans were lousy, as was the tasteless rice.  My wife had the lasagna-style Chicken (Chickaquiles or something like that) - pure mush with very little chicken.  Charles, you need to spend some time here!!!  The drinks were good.

4 stars for only one reason....the nori (seaweed wrap) was chewy.  I mentioned it to our waitress who promised to check - she agreed it should not be. Very large menu of specialty rolls...great luncheon menu with lots of choices for those not into raw fish.  All my sushi and the yellowtail sashimi were very fresh.  And my wife raved about the chicken teriyaki. Next time, I'm looking forward to a 5 star! Oh, no beer or wine, yet...byob is fine till they get their license.

We went back for lunch today.  And the Nori was excellent.  When I commented on that, the hostess recognized us.  Long story short, she found the problem had been a chef mishandling the nori....and he's no longer there.  Lunch was excellent!  We give them 5 stars for sure - and my wife is really not a sushi lover.  Today she had a fried pork bowl and loved it.  I had the 7 piece sushi plate along with some sashimi.  Excellent, but as usual, more than I really needed.  But it's soooo good!

Too bad.  What started out with a lot of promise has gone way downhill.  Within the last month, I've been to the 67th & Bell location and to Pleasant Valley.  There's just no comparison anymore.  Waitstaff is still very friendly, but the food quality is waaaay below 3 or 4 star.  Rice is gummy, some fish was actually warm and depending on who the sushi chef is, the rolls are not at all consistant.  Iris, you and your brother need to spend some time out here.....or you'll be out of this location.

Open a week and it's that good!  Wow, We're regulars already. Mike and a crew from the original Bucco have opened a small bistro in Northern Peoria and it was already packed this evening.  And it deserves to be packed. Half a dozen appetizers (I've heard the bruschetta is on the sweet side) , four or five salads, a bunch of specialty pizzas, half a dozen entrees and an equal number of pastas.  My wife had chicken picatta and I tasted it.  She loved it!  I'm not big on chicken, but it was great!  I ordered the pasta primovero and it was wonderful (altho I will ask for a little more garlic in the future).  We both enjoyed a caesar salad and thought it was fine - anchovie lovers need to lobby to have fresh anchovies available. Wine and beer only, but they have a "Twisted" brand wine for almost every type.  We tried the Twisted Merlot and Pinot Grigio and for house wines, both were more than adequate. Wait staff was amazing for only one week open and there were plenty of them. Our waitress bubbled in a very nice way and told us they were really looking for comments - obviously, they want to attract the locals and serve items they like.  I hope Jo-Ann is looking forward to Italian next week!

Great service, great food, good wine at a fair price.  What else could I ask for?   Almost a 5 star in our book.  Had the calamari (excellent and the sauce was very tasty) and shared a margarita pizza.  I understand that everyone has a pizza they use as a guideline...and this one is almost perfect for our tastes.  We've had the mediterranean, and it was equally good...but again, everyone loves a different kind of pizza.  So far, this is our favorite in the Northern area.  And gotta tell you....they've solved the bread situation.  Good Italian bread now!  With the dame fine dipping sauce.  A final piece of news.  I got invited to come back into the kitchen after dinner.  You may know that the GM of Twisted was the manager of the old Bucca down in Arrowhead (before it was sold) and invites to the kitchen were not unusual there.  Let me tell you, you could eat off the floor in the Twisted Kitchen!  Wow!  So why not a 5?  Because I see some of you had a bad first expereince - we've been here 8-10 times and have always been pleased.  So I hope you'll try Twisted again.  Then I can give it a 5!

It's almost a diner, but just a little too nice and too large to qualify.  But it's good old American comfort food.  I mean meat loaf, breaded pork tenderloin, hot turkey sandwich, liver and onions...you get the picture. (Oh, yeah - there's a full page of Grecian Entrees, as well!)  Breakfast served all day and they've got a good, basic salad bar.  Homemade soups and specials.  Don't drive across town, but if you're near Boswell Hospital, this is a great choice.  Very clean and very pleasant service.   You know, I posted then re-thought the whole thing.  I really can't think of one thing to down-star this place, so I'm raising the stars to 4

Don't go...horrible place.  Bad!.  Oh, did I give it a 4?  Must have been a mistake.  I'm going to go back in a few weeks and give you a more thorough review.  May have to go again in August. just to keep you up to date on this horrible place.  But a true, honest criticism...there is NO non-smoking area in this entire casino.  Not even in Cholla's lovely bar area.  I guess that's where I meant to award the 1 star.  The waitstaff could use a bit of training - this restaurant truly wants to be a 5 star, and almost makes it...just train the employees a bit more to 5 star service.  We had Chateaubriand...not nearly as tasty and tender as I expected, but still excellent and an excellent price.  And done just to our order.  Asparagus was wonderful - wish I had ordered a double helping.  The au gratin potatoes were a huge disappointment....need to get the cheese into the layers, not just on top.  The creamed spinach was wonderful as was the bread - especially the cornbread. (Next time, I ask for extra).  And the seafood bisque was wonderful!!  All in all, a fine experience.  I just hope they can make a few improvements and I'll be happy to give them another star!  And get the damn cigarettes out of the bar!

OK, I've had better in Greece and Detroit.  But around here, Ammos is tops.  We each had a gyro without the bread (low-carb diet, damn it!) and a large Greek salad.  The salad was big enough for a lunch.  And the gyros meat with the tzatziki was very good.  The owner visited with us for a while - he loves to brag about everything being fresh, made on site daily and from the salad, we believe him. Casual place...order at the counter and they bring the food to you and clean up after.  Good service!

Went again last night.  Happy to see Bill's busy.  I had the beef shawarma on top of a small Greek salad!  No pita (remember, low carb diet!) and it was great.  My wife had the gyros again and was just as happy as the first time.  Nice place!

When I can't find anything wrong, I give a five.  And Mario does everything right...from quick, on-time service to explaining exactly what he proposes to do!  It's sure nice to find a small, independant repairman who truly believes in customer service!  Reasonable rates, too.

Gee, I've been using Mario since 2012.  He still deserves a solid 5!  Our refrig is back in service thanks to him and his guy Bill.  And his rates are great.  One thing in particular - he charges a basic service call fee.  Finds the problem and tells you what he needs to do and how much it will cost.  If you have him do the fix, the service call fee is deducted...even if you decide a few days later.

For a neighborhood, patron extremely friendly, hangout place....this is the best!  Wed nite open mike, Sat night great local music (tonight it was the Community Service Band doing the 60's).  Reg or thin crust, but fantastic cheezstakes, calzones, salads.  What a fine casual place for the neighborhood.    Owner Craig loves to work the tables - especially recognizing new customers..  His girlfriend Megan is so relaxed and fun....we want to go back soon.  And the music. I hope every night is as good as tonight.  You want to know about the food?   Great pizza.  A bit different than the orig Philly Cheese Steak, but fantastic.  Once again, I ask you not to tell your friends.  We'll want to go back and get a table.

Back for lunch.  And there was a special - large pizza for the price of the small.   ordered Pepperoni.  Very good, but I wish Craig put a few more pepperoni on it. Next time, I'm going to ask. BTW, I asked for a thin crust this time, and it was great.  He'll do thin, just ask.  He has regular lunch specials - really enjoy this place

Not only are there more pepperoni (true last three trips) but Craig remembered my comment and let me know he reads Yelp!  Good memory and an even better pizza!  Ant the Cheezheadz subs are still the best!  Now if only the Cardinals would play that team from up north!

We were so looking forward to this place opening.   Ehhh, a bit of a disappointment.  Very clean, very friendly (counter) service.  But the food just...well let me explain.  I ordered a gyros.  Combo of beef and lamb and that's fine.  But the meat had way too much pepper in it.  60 minutes later I still tasted pepper.  The tzatziki was ok,,,something was missing - maybe a bit more cucumber?   My partner ordered chicken schwarma.  Her complaint was that the chicken was chopped up - heavily chopped up.  Hard to eat because the sandwich kept falling apart. She expected and would have preferred thinly sliced meat and more garlic in the garlic sauce.  We split a small greek salad.  Again, just ok.  The dressing was mostly oil and vinegar - not enough spices except oregano and probably no dijon in it at all.  Menu?  Basically a bunch of sandwiches in the $5-$7 range or add $2.50 and you get fries or rice or a small salad and a drink.  So would we go back?  Probably not.  If I start seeing better reviews, we might try once more.  Sure would like them to add a bit to the menu...like taramosalata, pastitsio, moussaka, or maybe souvlaki?  And for goodness sake, one of the fun parts of a greek restaurant is watching them shave the meat off the revolving spool.  Maybe Gyros Town doesn't do that, but if they do, they ought to bring the spool out from the backroom, so people can watch their sandwich being made.

A fine addition to North Peoria!  Went there for dinner - two ordered the "asian" slamon, one ordered chicken cordon bleu (house version) and I ordered the ribs.  All four said very, very good.  Only neg - poor cole slaw, a vinegar/sugar style and way too sweet. Beer was excellent, drinks were very well poured. Now serving breakfast on Sat and Sun and the menu looks yum.  Very cordial waitstaff. Oh, the comment on pub grub.  Ribeye, cordon bleu, two versions of salmon (one a special tonight), creme brulee and carrot cake both homemade, smoked St. Louis ribs.......pretty fine pub grub! And on a Tuesday night, a very good crowd - you might want to check reservations on a weekend.

Man, thank G this place opened.  No comments this time, but we've been her 6-9 times (we can't agree) in the last couple of months and we're almost never disappointed.  Still poor cole slaw!!!!!

OK, this is my last update.  Took two other couples there last night.  Everyone said yes, they'd go back.  Food was very good. Service was fine.  What a great neighborhood place!  Oh, yeah, the cole slaw is still bad!

Well, maybe just one more. Breakfast! (Fri, Sat and Sun only) Homemade, on the spot, corned beef hash!  And they can leave out the potatos! Try an omelet and ask for hollandaise sauce on top! Big, tall Bloody Mary. Absolutely 5 star for breakfast...and it's still a casual, friendly, neighborhood type place!

Sorry...looks like the Campbells have taken over.  Lita and Wendy are gone and the place is definitely lacking management.  Burgers were still done well, but the waitresses we used to see are all replaced.  And not for the good.  Business is still strong, but it won't stay that way if this afternoon was any indication.

What a place!  Expensive (2 Seniors, 1 adult, 1 student ran $80).  We didn't buy the add-on ticket for the Maze, but the main museum was wonderful.  First, the 3-D intro movie was really good!  Excellent 3-D and a fine intro to the world of butterflys.    After the movie, you are sent into the next room a few people at a time.  This is the room where you actually see butterflys as they develop and are :born."  The room is too small for even 25 people to be able to see the live progression and there was no one explaining what we were seeing.  The trip from the movie to the rain forest needs improvement.  The high point was entering the rain forest type room and being right next to thousands of beautiful creatures. (Be sure to take your camera).  Plenty of places to sit and watch.  Especially watch the children as the butterflys actual light on them (wear red - red seems to attract them).  We spent 30 minutes there and could have spent a lot more time.  The neat thing is there are sooo many breeds (?), so the colors are really spectacular.  If it weren't for this room, it would be a 2 or 3 star.  The next two portions - not much.  The bee exhibit and the ant exhibit were very small, almost like a afterthought, poorly explained and again, no one to explain or answer questions.

Surprised nobody has reviewed this place since it's right across the street from Hawkins Arrowhead.  Well, maybe it's because they found a better sushi bar to go to before the movie.  My wife had Chicken Teriyaki - good miso, strange oil/vinegar/ginger salad dressing on lettuce that looked like it came out of supermarket bag.  Chicken was just barely ok - she'll try the rest in a stir fry at home. I had Yellowtail sashimi that was very good, but not an attractive presentation and thicker cut than I'm used to (but I notice a lot of AZ bars serve it that way, so you must like it). The wasabi was NOT at all spicy.  Had a tuna skin roll that was just ok and we shared a California roll that  was pretty good.  All in all, the two stars says it - I've had a lot better.  Oh, when we left, the sushi chefs ignored us and the waitress yelled "Thanks."  What happened to Arigato?

Keep our fingers crossed!  Our first try, for happy hour yesterday, was pretty darn good.  And at 5pm, they had a very good crowd.  The old Verde Grill was up and down- more down than up - and Shea decided to change the plan to a "neighborhood hang."  It's located on the Trilogy Golf Course....a very neat bar area, casual as you would expect.  But the dining room is also newly casual and also has a bar and stool set up in front of the open pizza often. (no pizza yet....maybe in a month?).  When the weather is nice, the outside seating is great.  Limited menu, apps, salads (good sized), sandwiches and a few "dinner" plates.  The beer is served nice and cold! And they've got a fair selection.  We split an antipasto plate - very good for the happy hour $10.  Don't know what the happy hour beer is, our choice didn't qualify.  Looking forward to going back for lunch, and then maybe dinner.  (The filet and  the Delmonico are in the $25 area).

And I'm not in a rush to go back, either.  But all four of us said our meals were good.  The menu is minimal to say the least.  One page of food (mostly sandwiches), one page of drinks and the last page a Chinese menu.  I had the pulled pork, two had hamburgers (overcooked) and one had grilled fish tacos.  Their salad sides were very good.  We got there at 6pm on Friday and there were only 5 other people eating.  They got a little busier closer to 7.  But my take - their very limited menu doesn't offer enough choices.  Only one waiter, which says they weren't expecting a crowd.  If I were in Glendale for something else, I'd probably stop at Cuff's.  But probably only at lunch.

Almost seems a waste of time to review this place.  If you're not already a fan, my 5 star isn't going to change your mind.  But Wow!  Our two friends said the best brats (#8) they ever ate.  And our smoked sausage sandwichs (#18 & 20) were fabulous.  Sorry, guys, the lady who took our order (on a Saturday noon) was reasonably happy and the gal delivering from the kitchen was very smiley and friendly.  Must have been our Irish charm.  So next time you go, don't pretend to be Polish, tell 'em you're Irish!

Absolutely the worst, dirtiest, wettest bathrooms of any theater I've been in.  Period.  The management ought to be ashamed.  Plus they double sold my seats today and when I went to the ticket area, the young girl told me she wasn't on duty and I should talk to someone else.  I should stand in line to tell them they FU?  Screw that, let them keep up the good work!  Maybe there is no manager?  Nice seats.  Are they worth the wet floors?

These people are relentless.  Best way is to never use them.  But I swear they also buy lists and call those people forever.  How can they stay in business?

I'm not a fan of big chain steakhouses.  And I'm not going to cheer for this one before I try it again.  But first visit was very pleasant and the food we had was well prepared.  Next trip will tell the tale.  Didn't have a steak, but the guy next to me did and he said it was perfect--and it was a true medium rare!
