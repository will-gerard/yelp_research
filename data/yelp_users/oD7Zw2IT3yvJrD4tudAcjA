This place is always popping . But seriously why is there always just 1 bartender even in the weekends. I don't like waiting 30 minutes for my drink and I have to order my second drink as I am half way through the my current drink.

I was rushed! The whole time. My pedicure took 13 min they didnt push my cuticle I asked not to trim my nails. They trimmed my freaking nails!!!  I went back and for between 2 people like they wer tag teaming my pedicure.  By far the worst ive ever had. 3 days later my polished looked like crap and my cuticles wer not trimmed or pushed

I absolutely love this salon. I have been in search of someone that will listen too what I want and isn't in a hurry to cut my hair. These women are amazing. My hair looks great and even healthier. Best part my hair looks good even after leaving the salon. Prices are extremely affordable and the customer service is fantastic!

Tried this place out for the first time. Upon entering I was greeted by Ryan such an amazing guy very knowledgeable on all the products. I was tagging along with 4 friends me being the only girl always a sausage fest around me ha! We looked around for 1 or 2 interesting items they have not once did I feel judged about being in the shop with 4 other dudes and I looking at porn, pocket pussies, dildos and asking about anal lube and best dildos etc not ever in my life have I felt so comfortable with the workers about my private life behind my bedroom doors. I will continue to drive 1 hr across town to purchase such items. Totally worth it and they're open 24/7 :) Always a plus!!!

It doesn't get any better than this. It's like a piece of new York City here in the heart of arizona. Everything is made fresh.  Made to order so be patient if it's taking longer. It's worth the wait great s2 lice special and drink for 350. Toppings are extra

I don't think there is a store that will make me drive 1 hour across town to shop in. Lush is that store. The employees are amazing very courteous and extremely knowledgeable.  Professional and don't walk behind you or try to tell me their life story or likes or dislikes about products.  They are an amazing staff. I wanted to buy some soaps but couldn't decide between which ones so they cut me some samples.  How freaking cool is that? I give this lush 5 stars all the way

By far one of the worst fast food places! So disappointed.  Service is sucks. I don't appreciate how I work all day to earn $$ and go for a quick bite and get ripped off. It is not my fault you didn't finished school or dropped out and have no education and now your stuck working minimum wage . But don't rip other people off by the crappy service and crappy food.

Not impressed!! Very rude Over the phone when I called in.I went online to check them out. I booked an appt online with the services I wanted done. I get a confirmation email that someone is going to contact me. Someone did, the stylist I requested wasnt avail she said the next slot open would be in 2 weeks. So I said okay and took it the other lines were ringing and she was talking with someone else she asked if she could call me back in 1 min i said sure. Its been 3 days still no call. I was not please at all. I would much rather go to another location with better service even if the pricing is 50$ more and I have to wait, I will take myself somewhere else were they indeed want my service!

Got here at 830. The staff is amazing.  The gentleman that I drove up to was extremely helpful and cheerful. Gave me a good run down on special savings and why a wax is important.  But he did not pressure me into upgrading or buying anything.  Walked inside the young lady greeted me promptly with a good morning so sweet and nice. Will definitely come back. My car is amazing! ! BTW and I only got the basic. :)

My estetician was Nicole she did such a fab job I love love my brows!! So quick and painlessly not like other places I have gone.I will definitely be coming over here. Totally worth the 25 min drive!!  Did not wait I scheduled same day people there are so friendly and it smells like sweet orange I fell in love

i had a wonderful experience here way out of my way but i had a voucher called and spoke great english, driving there i got lost and they gave me directions stayed on the phone while i arrived. once i came in the place was well ventilated i was offered a bottle of cold or room temp water.  got a full set my nail tech was NOT rushing i enjoyed that she gave me her undivided attention. it was about closing time i wanted a pedi originaly i only came in for a full set.  my tech did my pedi as well it was incredible , even it was 15 min after closing she stayed they all did  she took her time and did a splendid job. at no point or time was there harsh upselling even though i live 1 hour away i will still drive o this place. highly recommend it

This place is great. The office looks like just in the pictures very warm and welcoming the staff is great and extremly helpful. Phoenic Family Medical Clinic is great for those who dont have insurance and / or are underinsured. I dont think i could have gone to a better place  its was fast and easy and they answered all my questions they even do priscription.

My groomer moved which sucks it always sucks. I was able to book an appointment for the next day which is always amazing prices are super inexpensive compared to salons or pets mart and petco.  I would highly recommend Ashley  she gave me exactly what I had explained to her and beyond! I would definitely pay way more for this service than she charges. His nailed are perfect!  They aren't sharp and they are cut down. Picking up my dog he wasn't shaking or scared and trembling he was happy and excited he is no longer a smelly pooch he is fresh and so clean!!  Thank you Ashley for the great experience I will definitely be using you from now on
