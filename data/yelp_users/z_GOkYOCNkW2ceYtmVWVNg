CHEATERS. My mother Charleen DelVillano MacMillan won bingo with a lady at the other table. Beth Reed and I screamed at the top of our lungs and the 2 employees behind us didn't blow the whistle to stop the game and DID NOT pay. AVOID. Bingo supervisor was a dick! Chris the Go to Lone Butte or Fort McDowell where they know how to run a game. Shame in you for ruining our Mother's Day outing. I will be bringing my high roller card to Lone Butte from now on!

I've been dining here since WHP opened. Every time has been a wonderful experience. This past week I came twice to entertain two different guests. Dan, Brian, Hugh, and Alinna were our serving team. Service was perfect. Steaks are amazing, Espresso Martini is awesome. All around the right kind of restaurant for this price range. Dinner for two was around $200 plus tip of you want to go all out. Worth every penny. Glad they are here in town.

Awful customer service. Friend and I spent a fortune. Wouldn't take my credit card because the numbers weren't embossed. Lied to us and said no rooms after giving us tons of liquor.
