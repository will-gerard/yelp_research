The best dining experience I've ever had. If you're looking to woo someone, whether its a first date or you've been together for a long time, this is the place to go. I treated my boyfriend here for Valentines day, and we had an amazing time.   BIG NOTE: Finding it is a bit difficult if you're unfamiliar with the area and are using GPS. I didn't look too into the location, as I rely completely on Google Maps on my phone and that was a mistake. Look into the location and get a good idea of where it is. GPS will send you into a golf course. Its located at the Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort. We took a wrong turn (left at the first turn, you're supposed to go right), because of some work they were doing on the road that had us confused. When we finally did get there, we had a hard time figuring out how to get to the restaurant, as there is a section for parties/etc. The main dining area is at the top of the stairs. They were very accommodating of our lateness due to this, and we still got the table that we had reserved.  This is an expensive, up-scale restaurant. While they don't seem to have a dress code that you MUST follow (I saw a few people who were more on the casual side of dressy casual), I would recommend dressy casual and above for this restaurant. While the atmosphere is classy, the waiters do not seem like snobs of any sort. They are very professional, courteous, and happy to answer any questions.   I recommend booking in advance with a note for window or patio seating (your preference), and arriving right before sunset hours for the best views and experience.   The food is amazing. The portions seem small to anyone not used to more up-scale dining, but it is VERY filling and amazing..

Great place to relax for a bit! Make sure you buy the koi food to get the full experience.

The waitress we had was really nice and explained everything on the menu and then again as things came out.

I never got to actually go here. When we arrived at 8:30 we were told by a bouncer at the door that you have to be 21+ after 8. It was a Friday night. I'm not sure if this is just a weekend thing or not. I'm also not seeing this mentioned anywhere on their website.

The quality of sushi here is between gas station sushi and your best grocery store sushi, but the price is better than both of those options. Most of the rolls only have one or two ingredients, and are very basic but it satisfies the sushi craving without dropping $50-60 on sushi for two. Teharu says that they're "fine dining" but I don't really see that. The seats at the sushi bar around the conveyor belt are very close together, and there's very few actual dining tables. I wouldn't consider any of this "fine dining" but to each their own, I guess. The only real con to Teharu is that their servers don't really have to serve you anything, so when you do need something they seem a bit rude. All in all, I think the super low price of food makes everything okay.   If you're a sushi snob and looking for top notch sushi, do not come here. Otherwise, if you don't really care as long as you don't get food poisoning, this is a decent place.

Amazing Boba! Staff is very friendly. Sat outside with five dogs and they did not mind (they're small dogs). I wouldn't recommend sitting on the patio long though with how hot the Arizona summers gets! We were burning up!   Dog Friendly: They gave us a bowl of water for the dogs! Great place to enjoy boba with your pups! Love this place!

Yesterday was my first time visiting this place (or even hitting a golf ball) and I already feel like a pro! $5 for a lifetime membership card that tracks your score, and depending on what time of the day you arrive, $25-45 per hour for a bay that can have up to 6 players. We got a bay with a couch which was REALLY nice. Everyone working there was friendly and helpful when showing us how to play. The balls have GPS inside that tracks where you hit them, and you get points based off of which target it goes into and where on the target. There are different "games" you can play but we only played the one the attendant set us up on. We ordered some cheese fries and they were delicious. The price of the food is a little higher than what you get, but its pretty understandable considering where you are. I'm stuck between being glad I don't live closer because I would sink my money into this place every weekend, and sad because I really wish I could enjoy it more often than I can. I wish Tucson had something like this, but we suck and only have bowling!
