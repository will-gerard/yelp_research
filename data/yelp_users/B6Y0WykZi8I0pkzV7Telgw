Incredible food, whether you just grab a fresh-made scone, or order a full meal. Good coffee. It can get crowded, but it is a fun and eclectic atmosphere. I definitely try to bring out-of-town visitors to Lux to get a good feel for urban Phoenix culture.

It was a lot better. Food and service have declined over the years. Still one of the best Irish pubs in terms of atmosphere... but don't expect much more than that. I can't even bring coworkers from out of town there anymore...

We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. We stayed one night as a 24 hour staycation and will definitely consider coming here again.   PROS: very helpful staff, clean and modern rooms. We loved that the hotel is separate from the casino (we hate having to walk through a smokey casino to get to everything we want). The pool was lovely and the two got tubs were just the right temperature.   CONS: the restaurant options on campus are iffy. We browsed through the different choices and we're not impressed by the atmosphere or food selection available. I guess the buffet is the best bet but I can't say that from experience. We drove the quick 10 minutes to nearby fountain hills and went to The Encanto. Also, to nitpick about the rooms. I'm 6ft tall and I had to bend over for the shower head. But that's probably it.   Very nice hotel for a reasonable price. We will come back!

Great local Mexican restaurant. Delicious good. This Encanto is a little smaller than the main one in Cave Creek, but they did a great job providing a unique atmosphere with their beautiful patio/courtyard.   GET THE POLLO FUNDIDO. My wife gets craving for that dish! That with some roasted vegetables was enough for us to share.   Highly recommend this locally owned gem of a Mexican food experience!

Fun brews on tap. Brilliant patio when it's nice out. Great sandwiches but the red goat salad (seasonal) is the best thing on the menu. Fun urban vibe in a historic house makes for a great atmosphere! VERY Phoenician.
