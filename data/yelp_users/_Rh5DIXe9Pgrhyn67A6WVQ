Dr. Brigham and his staff are amazing! my siblings and I were all treated with him (braces and Invisalign)  and because we loved our smiles my extended family are now in treatment with him. He understands and accommodates any concerns you may have about your smile ensuring you are satisfied with the results! And because Dr. Brigham is grateful for any referrals you send him I got a $25 gift card for each referral I sent him. Thats pretty much the cherry on top!

My friend and I were looking for a place to eat, something quick  and fresh. When we pulled up and walked in we immediately heard "ooh s***..." Mumbled from one of the employees from the kitchen. It became very apparent that they were preparing to close, and that we had arrived 5-10 mins before they closed. We immediately felt guilty and asked if we could still order and the male employee response was "well it's not like I can ask you to leave" he then proceeded to tell us what was shut down and what we couldn't order, it was then we decided to leave.  From my experience it is understood that the close time is when they lock the doors and that is when the clean up happens, and you never turn down an opportunity for more business. Overall this was a poor experience and the employees need more customer service training.

This place is a family owned business, with great native american art and jewelry! They are friendly and accommodating and will even ship your gifts to friends and family! Every time I go in I also find something unique and different and receive compliments on all of it! Definitely a place to take all visiting friends and family!

Looking through the reviews, I realize I am not alone. My collective experiences at this pharmacy consist of waiting, waiting some more reaching the window them telling me my insurance isn't updated and that i should just come back because they are too busy to deal with it immediately oh and that i should call my insurance and figure it out..... Another time i had went through the drive through at 9:45pm and the lady behind the window was clearly annoyed and told me not to come this late in the future as they are beginning to shut their computers down. Another time i was blocked in the drive through lane ended up waiting for 40 mins! and when i reached the window my prescriptions weren't even ready!  The staff is rude, constantly make you feel as if you are an inconvenience, and have no appreciation for your time. I high suggest getting your meds elsewhere.

Honestly so happy i have found this place. I drive an 09 bmw and after getting a handful of quote ranges for a battery replacement, and having my intelligence insulted by the BMW service rep, I was happy to take my car to a place and immediately feel at ease, not only did they know what they were doing but they were able to put it in terms that I could understand, and I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg. I truly would suggest this place to everyone!

Ive been in 3 times now and I seriously love this place! It has been hard finding someone that can thread my eyebrows just right! All the girls are very meticulous  and listened to my concerns. My eyebrows look so clean and crisp when I leave, and it is always easy to get it, especially with my crazy busy schedule!

Tried this place out for the first time food was awesome! I would definitely go back the only let down was the service was kind of crummy, there server did not seem like she wanted to be there... maybe it was an off night or something
