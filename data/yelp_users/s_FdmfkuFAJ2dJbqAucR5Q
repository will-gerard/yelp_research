I like Nandos it's a hidden gem. Yes the parking can be crazy, but in my opinion that's a GREAT sign. Gilbert isn't chock full of outstanding restaurants so this one certainly stands out. The service has always been tip top and you can't beat the portion size. I'm a fan of the chips and salsa and the margs. I've enjoyed most everything I've had on the menu. I often bring out of town guests here because strange as it seems it's really hard to get decent Mexican food in this area.

Lived in Germany for 16 years total. It's really hard to find "authentic" German food in the states. This comes pretty darn close!!! I love the owners, the servers, the oompapa band. Who knew Mesa had this in their midst?!? We go here every couple months and it's NEVER disappointing. Always crowded for sure and it's a wee little restaurant. So definitely expect a wait. But well worth it!

I came in here last week to get my oil changed and the service was second to none.  The assistant manager, whose name escapes me at the moment, was very kind and very customer friendly (as was his crew!).  I will definitely return for my next oil change.

We ordered a pizza to go but after 40 minutes, Ironside (yes that was our servers name) realized that she forgot to put it in. She still charged us for it by the way. And we waited an hour total to get a personal pizza. Not happy at all. They should have comped that pizza. One hour. One pepperoni pizza. Unacceptable. The pizza must have been rushed because we got it home and it was raw. I'll be back but with hesitation.

I want to give this place 4 stars based solely on food.....BUT....the manager is extremely annoying. I get it Fox restaurants tend to train their staff to be friendly and they definitely have a script they are required to follow, but my last visit here with my son left a bitter taste in my mouth. The manager was standing at the head of the line talking to customers and directing them as to which side to go to....order in or take out. It was really busy (not a big deal to me btw because I love the food and it's worth it). What irked me was that he was telling the customers in front of me how someone complained about him (can't recall if it was on yelp or through the website?) and kept going ON and ON about it complaining that it had happened! To be honest I understood why. I've been here several times and felt he was annoying (sitting down with diners, talking and lingering too long, etc.) I'll still go to this sauce it's very convenient location wise for me, but they could use a revamp in management. Way too shmarmy for me and seems pretty arrogant.

Just had lunch here last week and it was delish! You can't beat the lunch specials for $5.99! We had the gyro and my mom had the rice with hers, I went with fries. I made the better of the choice but the rice just wasn't my style. She liked it. The waiter was a cute friendly young guy. Couldn't have been nicer. I wasn't overly blown away by the tsaziki but it was decent. I will totally go back to try other food items and I'd recommend this place to friends who love Mediterranean food.

I've gone to Mastodon for over a year.  El has done my tattoos and Shane did my piercing.  I walked into the joint thinking oh my goodness it's so clean!  And it IS.  I love the work I've gotten done there and in fact I'm due for more so I'll be back soon.  I would and have recommended this to a LOT of people.  You can't go wrong by going there.

I don't want to even give this one star but my mother said they gave her a good shampoo so I'll do it. Plus there's not an option for 1/2. My mom and I went here to get haircuts but we didn't know any of the stylists so they booked us with whoever. My mom got Courtney. I got a girl who's name is Caroline. She had on hot pants, a sequined bolero jacket, wedge heels and so much makeup she looked like a clown. Courtney had on hot pants. There were other stylists wearing sundresses and open toed shoes. When Courtney cut my mother's hair it was so bad, one entire  side of her head was a full inch shorter than the other. I measured it. Now. I should have said no thanks when Caroline came out to get me cuz I thought it was a joke. But I didn't want to hurt her feelings so I went back. I told her only a trim there was no way I was letting this girl cut my hair in any way other than that. It was crooked in the back I realized when I got home. She also couldn't straighten my curly hair properly so I finished the job when I got home. $60 apiece. My mom was so upset by the terrible job on her hair she contacted Joe Lamarca who I believe is the owner. He said I tell those girls to dress appropriately but the don't listen....uhokay?! He told my mother he would send her a check and she could go to the Euphoria she normally goes to to get it corrected. This happened on 4-17-12 the check never came. I would NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE...unless I hated them. This was a huge disappointment and we will never go back.

Just called (7-11-14 at 9:18 am) to confirm a fax that my ex husband sent to my work that I never received.  The woman who answered the phone denied he was in there not fifteen minutes prior and then hung up on me when I asked her if anyone else had been there to make a fax.  He paid money to have a fax sent (and was staring at the receipt with the store and their number....) they did not send it....and someone needs to learn how to deal with customers on a friendlier level.  Nope not gonna recommend this store EVER.

Has to be some of the best Thai I've found in Mesa. It's not on the menu, but they do have pad woon sen, you just have to ask. The yellow curry is also delish. Fair warning this is a tiny place and it's ALWAYS busy, so it's best to go in knowing that there could be a wait for seating. I always do takeout...I'm smart like that. They don't serve alcohol, now wouldn't a beer be great with some spicy Thai? Still worth the trip and the owners are super sweet and friendly. Highly recommend!

So it was my birthday tonight and my boyfriend picked this placed based on online reviews (he doesn't yelp). It was such a great surprise I would come back here for sure. We had a great server, Marisa. I had the Capellini Pescatori and my boyfriend had the lasagna. Both were unreal delish. The salad was so good. The calamari was good we added the frizzles and worth the extra dollar. All in all we had a lovely dinner/birthday celebration and I'm so glad we found this gem!

Don't know how the food is. We've been here 45 minutes and no food yet. It's so not crowded in here at 1:30 on a Monday holiday afternoon. Our server Kevin was rude, slow and too old to be serving. Never will come back here. The food may turn out great....but this first impression leaves little to be desired. Guess what? A table next to us went to the bar to get their own beers....again Kevin was their server.  When I said the pizza better be be good I've waited forever.....Kevin only said let's hope so. Update: He also failed to give us hh pricing on the ONE beer we ordered....we couldn't order more he didn't check back on us until we finally finished eating. This was an experience to remember. FYI the pizza wasn't that great I'd rather have Vito's in Mesa than this hot mess. I'd never recommend this place to anyone.

So the food was delicious. We had a great meal. My son had the Mongolian beef. I had the fire something beef. Anyway both were delicious. But. We came in and seated ourselves. This is a very small place. Like it could have one server it's that small. There are two on tonight but neither of them decided to get us menus when we sat down. So I went and got them. That was after sitting there for about 5 minutes. After retrieving the menus it was another 10 minutes before the server came up to us. When she finally did she wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu. That's okay we both chose great dishes. Anyway we never got refills on soda the waitress at one point took my sons glass to refill it and never came back. We never got napkins. I asked for them mind you but never got them so after 10 minutes I went to the bar. She forgot. Of course. She never brought water after I requested. Again another 10 minutes. She actually left the restaurant area. I can't express how tiny this place is. Eventually I got tired and asked the cooks behind the bar for water and refills. Something I would never do but we were thirsty from the food. All in all I'll order out here before I'll ever eat in again. The food was great minus the edamame. It was meh.

Every time I'm in Scottsdale I drop in to Vito's. I love their happy hour menu and I'm a huge fan of the traditional Italian food. Best pizza in town including their Mesa location, which I've visited from referrals before. The new Scottsdale location has a great ambience and the interior is SUPERB. I love the feeling of being home that I get when I visit.

I've been here for dinner, brunch, and happy hour. I couldn't love a wine bar more than I do this one!....especially for Gilbert! Was there last night and although we waited a good hour to be seated it was WELL worth it. I got the bruschetta of course and so far I've yet to have a bruschetta there that didn't please me. They've got a great selection of wine (not beer though and honestly who wants beer at a wine bar anyway?). We got comfy seating very intimate, I would want a date to take me here for sure! The server was very attentive and I really believed her when she had eaten the menu items she was very knowledgable. If you want a great breakfast this place is the way to go seriously tasterific and the mimosas are abfab. Highly recommend this joint be prepared to wait on the weekends but enjoy a wine while you do because they have a server to assist.

For $25 this has to be one of the best AYCE so far that I've tried in Vegas. Seriously good rolls! Some of my faves there though we're the super white tuna nigiri (OMG GOOD) and the Tuna carpaccio! Highly recommend this place and they stay open until 3am?! Good to know after a night out!

This place is AWESOME! What a great find! We had two large Kirin Lights and managed to eat enough sushi to feed a small army and the bill totaled $34!!? The salmon nigiri was like butter. We loved this. I can't tell you how much fun it is to sit and watch food come around on a belt and pick and choose what is interesting or pretty coming your way. I found a place like this when I lived in Hawaii and I missed this here on the mainland. Well this is one place that I will return frequently to. Honestly half the price of what our normal sushi bill tends to be! Be prepared to wait for seating as this place fills up quickly. Only disappointment I had was when I went to the bathroom I realized they had an entire section they weren't using and they had people waiting to be seated. Not sure of the reasoning behind that. Obviously the belts are still moving there, maybe they were understaffed. Still...this was unreal how good it turned out and I wish I had known about this place a long time ago!

So this won't be hard to review. First time here. Sat at the bar. Cold food. Slow service. Bar staff was overwhelmed by the clientele. It wasn't crazy busy either. The lady bartender was not on target with her friendliness level. In fact, she was the rudest of them all. Her greeting to us was not hi how are you...it was are you sitting here to wait for a table to open...uh...The guys were better, there's potential there. We had to wave them down after 20 minutes to get another beer. They never checked on us to see how the food was. Which of the three tacos I tried I was only impressed with one (it doesn't help they were cold). I doubt we come back. Next time we may just go to SoCal Tacos. Edit: we told one of the bartenders how bad our experience was, he said he'd get the manager. The manager didn't come after 15 minutes of waiting. Thanks.
