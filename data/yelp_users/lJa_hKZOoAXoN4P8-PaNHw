After eating mind (and ass) blowing Mexican food at numerous Phoenix area eateries, I was totally DTG (down to gorge) at Tacos De Juarez. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed by the food, which was relatively bland and uninspired compared to some of what I've eaten even at some nondescript roadside taco joints in Arizona. The breakfast burrito was particularly boring. I think I could have made a better one myself. I really hate to be all negative, but I had very high expectations for Mexican eating in AZ, and a bad meal is a substantial chunk out of a very small handful of meals I was able to have while there. I'm afraid I have to recommend giving this place a miss, unless you're hungry and happen to be in the vicinity, though I can't imagine that description applying to any location in the greater Phoenix area whatsoever.

A perfectly acceptable strip mall Mexican joint that happens to be next to REI, which I found particularly convenient on the two occasions I had to go there during a recent trip to Arizona. Just thinking about the homestyle dishes they serve here is making me hungry for Mexican food right now. You fuckers are spoiled in the Southwest, I hope you know that. We don't get cafeteria food of this caliber where I'm from. One tip: don't order coffee.  One tip for the owners: is the gigantic TV really necessary? Also, get better coffee.

I was eating at Westville in New York, NY a few years ago and got into a conversation about food with a guy at a neighboring table. Eventually, talk turned to pizza. As it does in New York. And he told me about Pizzeria Bianco. And he said it was one of the best, perhaps the best, pizza in the USA. And of course I thought, this cannot be true. Because it's not in New York. Call it prejudice, and you'd probably be right, but New Yorkers are incapable of believing ANYTHING in New York is not the best of whatever it is. Pizza especially! Well, Pizzeria Bianco lives up to its reputation. I went twice while visiting Phoenix recently (second time was quite a long, New York-style wait) and had everything on the menu. Holy shit. Amazing. Many people I went with also thought "best pizza I've ever had." One old curmudgeonly guy wasn't impressed, but he's that old guy that's not impressed by anything, so forget him for now. I liked it. Especially the white pies! Which NEVER happens because I usually think FUCK PIZZA WITH NO TOMATO SAUCE. I was WRONG. The Rosa is FUCKING INCREDIBLE. GET IT. And more. And go back. I had to wait years to visit. It was worth it. Read my other reviews. I'm not usually this nice, even when I'm nice.

Holy fuck nuggets, this was some seriously good Mexican food!  OK, look, I'm from New York City, and I will admit I do not know JACK SHIT about good Mexican good. Why? Because we don't fucking have it! It's really frustrating! So when I travel anywhere in taco chucking distance of the Mexican border, I belly straight up and stuff my face with every dish ending in -ito, -dilla, and -o, with some sweet, sweet horchata (very generously portioned at this place) to wash it all down. I think the avocado/pomegranate guacamole made at your table is what sealed the deal for me on Barrio Cafe. I mean, seriously, OMG, the food here was delicious. I can't say there weren't a few false notes, but I can hardly remember what they were, so fuck it. The tequila menu is also ridiculous. I need to come back to work my way through it. I hope they offer ambulance service, because I don't even want to think about what's going to gush out of my body after I OD at this, one of the finest Mexican restaurants I encountered in the sprawling wasteland that is Phoenix.

Really fantastic breakfast. Not for vegetarians, I guess, because one of my dining companions was not impressed (except, I think she liked the eggs), but I was in hog heaven. Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the "city" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM.

This is the restaurant to visit in Montreal when you're a tourist with exchange-rate friendly money to burn. I ate here a few times before I became a vegetarian, and I'd probably go back now that I'm a big meat-eating cheater, because the steaks are excellent, as is the ambiance. It's in a historic building, which the designers incorporated into the restaurant, so it has that old world charm you came to Montreal for in the first place. If you're a local and you're reading this, you probably prefer going elsewhere. Please email me a list of your favorites, because I love your city.  Gibby's, I gather, is something of an institution which means something of a tourist trap, but it's not an overrated, Times Square-esque tourist trap, so I'd say it's worth a visit before you move on to whatever secret hole in the wall your French-speaking cousin wants to drag you to instead.

While this shop is overall a must-visit gourmand's paradise--a little taste of Europe in North America, particularly for us Americans from just south of the border--I am writing this review primarily to direct beer lovers to the one place they should visit for a sampling of Quebecois brews in Montreal. Definitive selection of Canadian, mostly local, beers, and most of them are not available (from what I've seen, which is a lot) in the US. Stock up. Most of the products are quite affordable, as the giant bottle craze seems not to have swept French Canada yet. Montreal is a beer drinking town, so most bars have great selections on tap, I should add. I had no idea the Quebecois were producing *this* much craft beer, though!  Warning for Americans, you are only technically allowed to import 1L of alcohol into the US (per person). Not sure if beer is an exception, and though the border guards are unlikely to search your car, you may not want to risk it and drink most of your beer in your hotel room, as I did.

Rustic, expensive Montreal eatery reputed to be among the best the city has to offer. The name means "pig's foot" and that is actually what we ordered. That and the poutine with foie gras (as an appetizer) and the duck in a can, which really is a duck in a can, boiled for 27 minutes and then dumped onto your place. It also has foie gras. Foie gras is everywhere in Montreal! This is rich, heavy, French food with a Quebecois accent, will leave you feeling extremely full, practically to the point of hallucination, and will make you shit out the entire population of Canada in the morning. So don't order too much.  Unmarked door. Double-check the address before heading out. Reservations essential.

An entirely respectable bar for beer-lovers, World of Beer introduced me to the unexpectedly amazing world of Arizona craft brew. You can't get this stuff where I'm from, so I was grateful I drove past and so the giant "World of Beer" sign, because a world of beer is precisely what I'm looking for most of the time, particularly when I travel. If you are indeed traveling to Phoenix, and you do indeed love beer, then World of Beer should certainly be one of your ports of call. It does have a "bar" ambiance, and a college bar ambiance at that. Which, to me, is less than appealing. But if you can get past that and possibly secure yourself a place to sit outside, you can enjoy your flights in peace, without having to listen to the dipshit conversations of the majority of the clientele. On the other hand, the dipshit quotient can work in your favor if you're just looking to get laid, which, I am informed, is no challenge at all in the greater Phoenix metro area for your average dude of average charm. Try to avoid talking too much about "hops" if this is your angle, beer geeks.  Helpful, friendly bar staff, but I can't say for sure they know what they're talking about. Luckily, you can hardly go wrong with Arizona beer. I recommend anything from Oak Creek to start. Delicious stuff.
