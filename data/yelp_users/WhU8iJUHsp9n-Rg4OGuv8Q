This is my favorite sushi place of all time. The portions are huge and the food is so tasty and reasonably priced. I like how they have a bar too within the restaurant. Nacho mama, Vegas roll, and orange chicken are a must

Favorite place to watch the game while at chase field. Right next to a bunch of TVs and a full bar with a great view. Air conditioned and you have a lot more room to relax

Where are the managers at? Because they apparently don't watch the attitudes of their employees. Ester d was rude and didn't acknowledge me once. While at the drive thru window another girl came up to start spraying windex. Are you kidding me? I'm getting my food why are you cleaning in my personal space. I will not be returning

I came here for the first time today and was completely blown away with all of the coffee and tea options. The staff was very friendly, welcoming and extremely knowledgable about what they do. I will definitely be returning in the near future
