Stop for breakfast this morning  the portions were good the quality was not there. The food was delivered cold and on the tray to us and not place in front us on the table. The girl was not focus on customer service. In today market were you can pick from many places for food  i look. for quality, and price. They fail today in both areas.

Stop by this AM for coffee and sandwich. The food is little better but still need help on the presentation side and when you state on the menu "egg your way" I should be able to order it my way. After it cost $ 9.00 for sandwich which is high.  Service could of been better and prices lower. Save yourself the money and go across the street and save $ 4.00 on the same items.

This place is below par. The cashiers are to busy to take care of customers because they're on their cell phones alot Left several message for the manager "Patricia" she never call back so you know where she is as for customer service. The only people who seem to care are the van drivers but they have problems with the staff and under man. And when does rain you have to be careful where you park due to flooding in the lot.  So lets see 4 days p/week  X $ 7.00 p/day=  $ 28.00 X 52 weeks=$ 1456.00 X my 3 people $ 4368.00 P/Yr. Well Patricia that is what you are losing as of this week. My people and I are moving to another lot.

If you want good Mexican with nice servers. Some say not authentic Mexican But Good enough for me. I think it's the Very Good. If you are not sure what to choose- just ask the waitress to surprise you Very Very friendly staff and the price is very reasonable.

I love Pita Jungle but we had stop for lunch today at this Chandler location. The food was good, but the surrounding environment was not okay with me.  1. The girl sat down at a dirty table 2. Both bathrooms  (M&F)were very dirty 3. Some of the wait staff was in another world  4. Leftover food on the patio deck and not pick up  I had asked one the wait staff to pick up the food from the deck and look at me like I was speak another language. After speaking with manager he did send someone over and it was finally taken care of. Where the common sense with food works today, and you is want better wages well take better care of your work environment so your customers would enjoy coming into your home to eat.  The manager also needs to be more visible and walk through his business or none of this would of happen.

I fly US SCARE WAYS often (85K) a year their on-time is much better than the past. I think I would have flown any other airline, but have a lot of miles with them and they fly most of the places I need to go.  Pro: On-Line record better than the past         Prices are Okay  Con: Old on board menu never changes same old SXXX          Gate people need to go through customer service training..the rudest in the industry.          Stop nickel & dime the customer.  The public needs to teach all airlines that the customer is in charge by ALL of us together not flying one day anywhere to teach all of them a lesson..............But that will never happen. They get a 2-stars for their on time getting better than last year.

Overall this place looked nice and has good food. Tables were too close and we felt like you would be dining with all the people at the tables which surrounded everyone so we ate at the bar. Too pushy on the alcohol, not everyone drinks alcohol. Servings were small.  We ate at the bar it was okay, good service but you needed keep on top of the bartender. I would go back and eat again.  The wine selection was very good. I think a major plus is the menu.

BBQ ribs were pretty good the meat fell off the bone and the prime rib was good as well.  It's a good place to go for a day. Once you're there, don't miss the ghost town that is just 1/4 mile away.  The service was very attentive and good.

I stopped by tonight and the chicken is by far what this place is famous for. Definitley try it out. They have a full bar and live music on the weekends. They also do takeout if that's your thing.  The staff and the place seems well maintained and attentive. Prices for the chicken was very reasonable. After 3pm, i think, they start serving baby back ribs.. If you're in the Apache Junction or Gold Canyon area this place is worth checking out. Don't worry about the locals that hang out here, they're just as friendly as anyone. If you own a bike and drive there be careful the lot is full gravel.  Pro's:  Music, Patio seating, Prices $$ Con: Gravel Lot,  Leave your AMEX home they don't accept it.

I am writing this review primarily because the staff there is very good and attentive.  And this is my 3 time to the place. My waiter was Johnny and he was very attentive.  The food? Well, I wouldn't recommend the prime rib or beef forestiere...I had the prime rib and was serve on the chill side and was tough. Prime rib need to be tender and higher quality of beef which this was not. The beef forestiere was tough as well according to my dinner partner.  Anyway, I was glad to hear that they had live music (LOVE live music), so I might be back sooner than I thought.  Like I said I been here before and the salmon was very good over the salad my last time here. The wine selection is good.  Seriously, awesome staff!  The manager was  on the floor and did check in with the tables, I would recommend that he be checking the kitchen and food before  it leaves the kitchen and order better selections of beef to serve to the customers.

Time at the location 1 pm Oct 3, 2009  All, just wanted to add a few comments about a this restaurant that i stop to eat. Its Steeler bar which is not problem -I am Eagles fan and there a few tv's around  The food was not that good I had the roast beef with lousy gravey more like a paste, my wife had the chicken sandwich which according to her was fair. The service is the worst I've have ever experienced. I would not recommend this place for anyone who like spend their hard earn money and not get good food adn service in return. The Hostess need to find another job was not friendly.  BTW this place doesn't care about your 2nd Amendment Rights. There is a sign post at the door.  Spend your $$$$ elsewhere

Way understaffed and service well that is another story it needs work.  Food is could be better. The  only thing is that the German pancake 20 minutes wait and are good.  They charge for substitution when you don't want the potatoes  Example $ 1.00 for  mixed fruit instead of potatoes.  The prices are very high already and you want  extra dollar for stuff I am already paying in the base price. I think I will go elsewhere.

This is a value given the surroundings and is the best place to stay for anything happening on the stripe. Keep in mind this Best Western DOES NOT recognize you as business traveler " Diamond" level and DOES NOT do breakfast.   The Hotel is clean but not easy to get to with either a shuttle or taxi.   Remember this Best Western is like the other Plus location.

This my 3 time back to Tia Rosa I am liking this place! The food is out of this world delicious! The expansive list of margaritas is as delicious as the food selections!   And the service has always been attentive, flexible, and upbeat! You should not go wrong in this place. The only thing to worry is how busy this can get so get there early.

I am sorry to say that this place has not fair well with me. Saturday I order two Cheese steaks  and they were lousy. The mushrooms, rolls were ice cold and the onions were not fried onion.  The french fries were greasy and messy.   ** The service was polite.  If it was not for the polite service this place would not be rated at all.  There are two other places know in the valley for cheese steaks that would be rated 4+ stars they are in Gilbert and Chandler.  BTW if anyone of you are wondering, I do know what it takes to make a great cheese steak I was born and raise in the Philly for the last 40 + year.

Remember dealing with car dealerships is a pain in the A_ _. So this was my first experience dealing with a dealership here in AZ.   Talk about one professional outfit.  This is one that is professional through the whole process. I am new to the area and was looking for a new vehicles, and  I have good car buying experience here.......!    After talking to them about the  2011 Tacoma and dealing with a few dealerships, these guy come to the front.    I was looking for good deal, and price that would allow me to feel comfortable dealing with a car dealership. The dealerships where not dealing to much on the Tacoma, but this one make concessions on the vehicle as well as making a profit to stay in business to service you later.  So if you  travel to The Big Two dealership on 1250 S Gilbert Road remember to asked for Steve and Mo they'll treat you right.  Thanks guys for a painless auto buying experience!

Update for AM Breakfast:  Love the attentive service, decent prices, & outdoor patio. The waitress checked on us frequently even though we were having breakfast. The breakfast was very good and the portions were decent. I would rate this place as number 2 or 3 best place for breakfast in the Queen Creek area.

I been in the QC area for about 5 months, and seem a COX techs 3 times so far. Their service is down a lot compare to Comcast which I had for 5 years on the east coast and only seen their techs twice   Cox Internet = Good when it's working   Cox cable = THE CRAPPIEST SERVICE EVER.  They wont fix anything, they wont help you out, their channels are constantly pix-elated.    You pay for HD service.  You *HAVE* to rent a cable box from them to get HD.    SOMEONE PLEASE END THEIR MONOPOLY.    Ugh cox cable sucks so bad.  I think it time to kick COX to the curb and get SAT TV

The prices were extremely reasonable . the service was a little slow but very good. The night I was there live jazz music which was very good.  The only negative thing is to get rid of the chips they use on the cheese dish and replace them with a quality crackers.  I'll be back to see if the service does get quicker and if they expand the menu.

We stopped at Forefathers for lunch this Saturday . This was our first visit, but we thought we give it a south Philly try coming from the Penna area. so yes I do know what a cheese steak should be.  It was good!  Not great ! The place was busy and people were even sitting outside in the heat.   Even though it  was packed the staff was friendly and efficient. The line moved pretty quick.  Our Original Phillys were messy and good.   Our negatives:  The size of the dining area. It was a bit small and crowded today.  The meat was per-cook it take away from the moisture and meat had a little burnt taste. You should make the sandwiches to order ... every order with fresh rib-eye meat "not the pre cook" stuff. keep the grill a little lower not burn the meat.  I will try this place again the future to see if anything changes.  The price for two cheese steak, 2-fries, 2 coke was $ 22.00 and change a little steep.  The combo did not include the drinks.

I was on recent business trip to the Vegas strip and I stay at the MGM Grand. I was  looking for a good dinner and couple of the workers pointed me to TJ's.  This is a classy steakhouse that will not disappoint you. My server was very serious attentive, and  right on with his delivery of service, but the other staff were friendly and engaging.  I had the prime rib which was prepare perfect and was very tender to the fork which I use to cut  it with and serve along side of the wedge of letter. I do recommend  you bring plenty of money to cover the bill.

The Flat food is just okay. The best deal is the flat iron steak for under $ 10.00, but the rest of the menu and drinks is way over price for what you're getting. As more dining places come to Queen Creek area this place will be less attractive.  Pro: Flat Iron Steak, Pit Fires, Dancing, etc  Con: Overprice menu and drinks prices for the local area, and depending on time to many kids.         Bartenders need to be more friendly and smile.         Customer service is missing needs work

Check out San Tan Flat again it been awhile since I've been here.  Atmosphere = 5 stars  Food = 1-2 stars skip the big $$ stuff not worth it. Service = 1-2 stars  Service was even worse the last time I went.  Thank GOD there new places opening up in town. Nothing but a tourist trap for over price food and drinks. People do yourself a favor spend your money elsewhere.

Today I was fairly unimpressed with Sweet Tomatoes. I just recently went for my first time.  I walk in 11:45am Sunday and the salad bar was not stock what that with lunch starting.  The food was not that good, but it also seemed pretty basic. The salads, soups and desserts were far less than the outstanding dishes I thought they would be. The whole place seem dirty with many table not clean off for new customers. The staff was friendly but did not seem energize to keep the food stock and with cleaning the food areas. I will not be back even if the food was for "free"

I visited The Deli for the first time yesterday for lunch. The service was amazing and attentive. The Deli is family-owned and operated on our visit, we've received table-side visits from the chef/owner to ask if we enjoyed our meal. I had the Cuban pork and it was delicious along with the lemonade and my friend has the Italian sausage which he stated that was good.  The food: Quite possibly one of the best food I have had in the valley in a really long time. The Deli of Queen Creek has something good going - and I hope they are around for a really long time.  The bottom line: Do yourself a favor - and make a trip to The Deli. You will not be disappointed. I promise. And if you don't like it, please, please, please let them know so they can work with you.

Service was poor at best meaning it takes a lot of time to get the food out of the kitchen (25 minutes) our server was doing his best and he was good. When we walked in there they had a few customers at first then was crowded later. We had pancakes, and French toast both with bacon, the restaurant al carte you  alot our price out the door $ 20,00 for two. The restaurant pushes every thing onto a small plate to make it look like you're getting a lot but the portion are small.   Very disappointed in kitchen service, food quality, and price. We could have had better food and service from another place.  PS- The cook should stay off of his cell and worry about cooking for the customers.  *** I am still trying to understand why this restaurant think it can charge high prices here in the desert.

**** Baci Italian Bistro  in Queen Creek is a hidden treasure ****  This place is in such a out of the way area, No one know about it.  I was stunned as I walked in the front door, I was expecting a simple cafe with a few tables and chairs around them. What I found was elegant dining room made to feel as if you are sitting in a Italian enclosed courtyard complete with a fountain in the middle of the dining room!  I love Italian food a lot, and I am picky. This is the BEST I have had in Arizona! Their Veal dishes are phenomenal, perfectly breaded and prepared. The staff is super friendly, as my friend and I walked in (during dinner) a female, who I took to be the chef, welcome us and asked us if we were "hungry?" I being a medium build man as well as my friend naturally answered "yes."  I cannot imagine what was brought out to us were their normal "dinner portions." nice portions of veal,  I could not finish and asked for a to go box. I cannot praise Baci Italian Bistro enough, it is great, go ready to have a good time and you will not be disappointed. I recommend this for a casual lunch or a romantic dinner for two, you will not go wrong at Baci Italian Bistro!  The only thing that need work here the owner needs to let his family seat everyone, and the pizza need to be better. I'm like the pizza from the east coast more.  The dress code is mixed.

Over the year and half BACI has gone down hill. when he was the only business in the area he could command the price and act the way they do but since other businesses moved into the area and have a  much better product and pricing BACI need to rethink customer service and their product

Josh-  I believe you, but from the menu on-line they're charging NYC prices @ .80 per wing--WOW just to name one in the desert which is stupid with so many other places around Tailgaters Grill will have to work real hard for me and my crew to come in their location.  Please take a look at their menu it's a little pricey

I had EZ Flow Plumbing out for  RO and a soft water system installation awhile back and was very happy with their work. Keep in mind they were not the cheapest but they were price in middle and dependable. My water heater went this month and needed a replacement water heater and EZ Flow was there same day service and replace the water which was 10 yrs old.  Remember people you get what you pay for I've always found EZ Flow very reasonable in price, and the service is AAA+ quality.

Where is Col Sanders when you need him. The KFC company is lacking (QSC) Quality, Service, and Cleanliness. This place need HELP from the customer service, lack of management  and the food. Not only do you charge the highest prices for their products but today your product was dry and overcooked. KFC go back to square one for running a business and customer service. Please train your employee's to serve quality food.  I'm sorry but KFC move over for other chicken places especially behind your location at least their chicken is always fresh, not overcooked, and price better.

The food here was okay and the prices are reasonable, but one thing I would say is that front line need while serving food need to be keep a lot cleaner than it is now. To many places at the front counter there cross contamination with the food.  With some focus and people who care this place can be great.

The cafe is under new ownership as of this month  The food has already acceptable and the service is attentive. The atmosphere is great... very open and welcoming in the main area,  I visit the other coffee shops in the area where the coffee is always over price and the music is to loud to hold a conversation either with someone or on the phone. This place has been the opposite so stop and check it out.  I understand the menu item are changing and new atmosphere is welcome change.

Well the new post office in Queen Creek open last week and I have to say the office and ground are nice. But there is still this very big problem.  THE SERVICE & PEOPLE who work there must be the slowest people in AZ.  I gave them the benefit in old post office due to the size that must be some of problem, but no it is not.   So Mr Postmaster what do you have say to service to service you offer in QC.  Where are Kiosk's Where is the self service machine Where are you friendly workers  Where or Where is the service?  My business will always go to the UPS store in QC , where the service and people are very customer service friendly and speedy.  And yes they will process all US Mail.  No wonder the USPS can't make any money it run by Moron's

Quality of food is okay and with normal price. I had the eggs & bacon and the hash brown was greasy Service was also a very slow and there weren't more than 8 people at the whole place.  The staff was polite but need help on service, cooking and presentation of the dish they are serving.

Roads are good Service not so good  This place is a tourist trap in every sense of the word. The restaurant and gift shop are overpriced for what you get and the ice cream isn't anything special. Service from the staff needs to be a lot better and treat the customers like you want them there. Always understaffed always waiting on food. Been there a half dozen time no improvement.  Do come to the area for the beautiful views, not for the food or souvenirs. Great road for motorcycles ride.  During the summer outdoor cooking.

I first visited to this spot last night where I was able to sample food off the the happy hour menu. The place was packed they had music starting at 6 pm which was pretty good and service was very good and attentive.  I also ordered the brochette, which comes in two, four, or six increments. I chose six(and kindly shared with the friend): two "Apples, Brie, Fig Jam, Honey and Agave Drizzle", one "Tomato, Mozzarella, Basil, Balsamic Reduction", and one "Smoked Sock-eye Salmon, Brie , Eggs, Onion Capers".   The smoked salmon was the weakest. The flavors on the apple one just melded well together, and there was both red and green apples on it. The balsamic on the other brochette was very sweet and yummy, and the tomatoes were clearly very fresh. Would definitely order these two again!    The small Caesar salad was okay...nothing to speak about. Maybe the dressing could be improve.   The wine was $ 5.00 and there was enough to choose from and was very good.  Pros- Music from 6-9 pm that is early enough for you to enjoy instead of waiting for late night music that start at 9 or 10 pm.  Cons- Not really any but would like the happy menu expanded to have more to select from on it due to the fact after two visits you could run out of selections.

Since moving into the area (2yrs) now I have beein using this Fry's the people who work there seem good. I only problem is the meat counter they need to work harder for me to order meats from them. It seem everything is problem for them to do....they do need more customer's skills when dealing with the customer.  The other problem is the "carts" in the parking lot people seem not to care about putting away the cart once they are done with it......Maybe people here are just plain lazy.

This Fry needs to stay on top of rotation of veggies. Again the Campari tomatoes on the vine were spoil only 1/2 day. These are expensive tomatoes you would think a couple days of being okay in the refrig. This is the 3rd time with these tomatoes from Frys. The food bill are high enough that the Fry's business should make sure that the customer gets top products for their dollars.

Again this Fry's needs new management at the Deli counter. The service is so slow with customer service and the ladies don't get it right when measuring/slicing the meat at the counter. They never pay attention. I stop a manager a couple times and pointed out the problem and it seem they are not getting it due to the fact you come back the next week and it the same old problem.

About a several day ago, I bought Ghost Armor in Mesa AZ at the Superstition Mall for my TF101 ASUS Transformer. The screen had a noticable scrap on the screen in it but the installer stated that would go away in few days. I was not impress with crew due to fact they did not pay attention to the customer. I call customer service and the manager James at ext 112  and no return call to a few calls, so to say there is no customer service with this company.  I would be very dealing with this company  Rules:  1) don't turn power on for 2 hours 2) don't put device in your case or purse for 24 hours 3) ghost Armor has a lifetime warranty on the product, installation errors can be corrected after 7 days of purchase at no cost, After 7 days you will be responsible for paying installation fees to have Ghost Armor re-applied to your device.

This shop put the care back into auto repair  Gilbert Family auto is an excellent and professional shop to take any auto to for repairs. I took my vehicle in there, they were honest, and back up their work. I had a minor problem with the car after it was hot and sometimes would not stay started. Thanks to Chuck and the gang and the work they did the problem not longer a problem. Work done- Change out spark plugs, oil filter, and some minor item flush the transmission fluids, cabin filter.

I am very pleased with the job AZ Luxury Lawns did for me what a professional team. The sales rep, Jake was a pleasure to deal with throughout the whole process and Jake was there every step of the way including the installation.. When Jake came out to give me an estimate there was no sign of the high pressure sales pitch I had anticipated. He simply educated me on their product and the quality of service his company would provide. He steered away from bad mouthing other companies (which shows a true salesman). If you're looking for a great company look no further, I can assure that you won't be sorry if you choose AZ Luxury Lawns Take the time to get your three quotes and asked for customer references they have them.

Okay some time pass by for my review:  I am very pleased with Authority HVAC! and working with David was nice to have as well   The techs were on time, efficient and knowledgeable. How nice to know that my ACs are in great shape and I have a new AC company to call if I every need anything!  Its so hard to find reliable and trustworthy companies here in the valley, but this one is a keeper.  The company install my new AC and very reasonable on their pricing.

I've been hearing good things about this coffee house in Cave Creek so when Big Pete Pearson was playing there I decided to go. The show was excellent and Big Pete Pearson is wonderful person the service was attentive, and the food was good. Comfortable place to just hang out with your date. It would be nice to see more of the outdoor entertainment like this.

The menu is pricey for steak sandwiches I know it Gilbert but come on. They should look at running specials to keep the prices down. The quality and portions are not as high as would like think for the price you paying.  They are better place in the valley as better prices for the same product.

Just recently had brake service, and  a oil change done at this shop the people seem friendly, and the prices were average we did get a discount on the brake and oil service which help across the total bill.  If you are looking for a shop you might to try this place. Compare to the other repairs shops in the area these guys are better than those others shops and belive me I have done business with them all and you can read my reviews on them.

I LOVE this place. They have great service!!! I got seated quickly and love having the pitcher of water on the table. Makes it easier to fill when needed and not have to wait for a waiter.   The food is great! You can eat here whether you are a health freak or a heavy eater. Either way, your meal comes with plenty of food. California I had the waffles and share a egg benedicts . They also serve freshly squeeze orange juice. Real orange juice!!! A bit expensive for the orange juice but it is worth it if you like orange juice

Having moved here from the east coast the Philadelphia area I grew up on Rita's Italian Ice.  I have been to the Glendale location this Sunday with a friend I had a Gelati (chocolate & cherry), and my friend had a Banana Misto. Both products lack the fruit that Rita's ice is know for and set them apart from others. The quality of product was not consistent with product I had in Philly two week ago.  Again where's the fruit?

John came out to repair my AC and discovered that I had a leak in the line and had lost all the Freon in the unit. He offered some options for repair and I chose to go with a liquid sealant through the lines, to try and repair the leak, and to refill the unit with Freon. John said this was the cheapest option but did tell me it was not guaranteed to work. The repair did not last, so we requested a quote for a new unit. At the same time I also requested quotes from 3 other companies for the exact unit. After looking over the quotes John was the highest by more than 30%. I have not complaints about the service John gave but I would be sure to compare prices for replacement parts/service when using him.

In today's world, people don't stop and take the time to say thank you to the people who help you and are upfront and honest. I wanted to take say thanks to Ralph and his crew for a job that went beyond the normal course of doing business. Needing a reliable moving company to relocate my son to Blythe, CA from the east valley I reached out to several movers and to my surprise there were not many good businesses to deal with in this field in the area. They were either over priced, rude on the phone, or gave a low price and would not back it up with a quote. I finally found Ralph at azactivemovers.com. Ralph was courteous, upfront with a written quote, and did a great job, making the move very pleasurable for my family. So if you need a reliable business reach out to him a business you can trust here in AZ.

AWESOME CREW!!!  Couldn't have been nicer, quicker or more accommodating.   Ralph and his crew are great.    Moving is a big pain but Active Movers makes it bearable. I have use Ralph before and need his services again for two separate deliveries one trip to Ehrenberg AZ and the other to Cottonwood AZ.  Active is a full service business and customer's support is super.

AMAZING GREAT cheese-steaks!!! They are huge for the price, tons of meat, pick your topping. So good!  I'll be coming back again. It's a great find in Gilbert Town Square and it's so nice to find a business that offer a great sandwich.  ** Remember Mike to fuse the roll with the meat & cheese on the grill so the roll get hot.  The best in east valley compare to others here on the east side.

Thought I would give this place a try since I have been there a few times . . . a mistake . . . definitely not what I would call a good restaurant.  First . . . the place is small, and. second the food was not really that good (under cook) . . . third . . . the service was adequate. The servers are not organized and lack direction from the manager.  I ordered the breakfast two egg over medium with bacon.. The owner/manager is to business on the computer in the doorway and not paying attention to the service of her customers during the rush hour    .Most likely will not return . . . Today there many options in the area.

The food is very tasty and the service was attentive keep in mind that business was very slow during dinner time .  The place is certainly a welcome addition to an area chock-full of boring, regular ole Scottsdale restaurants.   I ordered Ceviche and the  1/2 chicken which was good, but I had better. The prices are a little overpriced  We would go back to eat more often if the food was 15-20% less expensive and it would be even nicer if more people visited. Dinner for two with drinks $ 90.00

First off!  This is breakfast review of this place.  The location and seating is very nice The menu is ala carte and server in little plates.  The food was good but under portion and over price keep in mind its ala carte.  Service /Server was very slow and it was not busy the meal did not come out together and server miss portion of the order  Sample prices Side of toast $ 2.00 ea Side of potatoes $ 3.00 ea  Large  OJ $ 4.50 ea  One Egg & Bacon $ 4.50 ea  The total for two $ 27.50 w/o tip.  If Postino East is going to charge these prices for breakfast they should delivery AAA service, but I do not think I will be back. The breakfast across the street is easy 20% lower and just as good.

The food is very good, but what even better are the people.  I needed their help and Todd the manager step-up and was there for me.  My hat go out to this business for going the extra mile.

Honestly, this is probably over rated BBQ I've ever had, with the including the brisket, which was tough and clearly dry brisket should be moist without the sauce. The ribs were pretty much undercooked a little. The pork was dry and a bit tough. Unlike the other comments here I like my ribs falling off the bone, but not to the point that cannot enjoy.  If you're in the area and their open, it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good BBQ is. It good to get others opinions on this place.  My server was great, friendly, and attentive. Prices are reasonable.  I will visit again under the 3 strikes and you're out rule.

Stopped by for lunch & had the hamburger with a green house salad and my other half had the turkey Panini  all fresh ingredients. We splurged and split a bread pudding. WOW!   This one of the few places where you see quality control out of kitchen, and super service from the cooks who care what he produces to the server who care about customer and expectation.  Classy relaxed decor, great prices, superb quality. John our server was awesome. Cannot say enough positives about Rusconi's.   Definitely a keeper! You must try Rusconi's!! And We will be back for more!

Most professional service organization and a quality job from them. Their prices are very reasonable. I am extremely satisfied with the entire process from the first call to the hand shake at the end.  We will definitely use them again. I have 28 windows and two story home top notch work from this company.

The food & service was okay. I've experience better burgers for less price.  2 Burgers & 1 soda was $ 23.50 which I think is high. I can go three miles over and pay 1.2 that price.

Very Upscale Dining  Finally! We have a fine dining establishment in the STV area. I have eaten here now and perfect.  The Veal is great and of course the pasta is superb.  The portions are over generous. The wait staff is very friendly and spot on. The food comes at a decent pace. Just can't say enough good things about this place. Please stop by and enjoy this restaurant. Support your local owners.  BTW dessert was excellent.  Food - Excellent ***** Service - Good **** Price - Low to Moderate $$

I used J&B Artscape service last year and John did a great job on my services that I needed. The issue  I ran into this year is that I call John to provide the same services and he came by to price it and schedule it. But no show for a few weeks and after a couple calls and no return calls from him, so I call in another company for the same price and did a great job.  John does a great job when he show up, but getting to hold to the schedule is a problem and his lack of keeping the customer inform. I hope he does better moving forward with other customers.

The car wash is just fair. If you have bugs on the front of your car it will come out of the wash with the bugs still on the car......I thought when going to a car wash its suppose to get rid of the bugs as well of the car...They need to scrub the cars as they enter the wash since their brushes are not getting the bugs
