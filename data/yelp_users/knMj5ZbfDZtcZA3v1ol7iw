A pretty decent airport.  It gets you going to where you need to be.  They have phone charging stations.  The food was pretty good.  This place got me to where I needed to be; it did its job and Yay! I'm a fan.

Excellent place for horseback riding!  My wife and I did horseback riding together for the first time.  We did the hour long one and our guide was friendly and cool.  I must say the staff especially the front office cowboy and the cowboy roaming around the restroom are hilarious!  We enjoyed that whole experience.  Breath-taking views along the way.  Prices are good.

Heard a lot about Crack Barrel.  They have it in the Midwest which my family is also from.  This time I finally got a chance to try it during breakfast.  My wife said they had to wait an hour in Chicago in order to be seated at Cracker Barrel.  But the location we went to in Phoenix, we were immediately seated.  The service was excellent.  I wanted apple juice and the server figured out a way to accommodate me, even though they ran out.  They were really attentive.  The food was great!  I had the redundant Chicken Fried Chicken with biscuits and gravy, grits, eggs over easy and a casserole hash.  It was so good.. the chicken was fried perfectly, nice and crunchy, tasty.  The biscuits were melt in your mouth near flaky texture and gravy was good and tasty.  Grits were good.  The hashbrown casserole was nice and hearty.  The meal that I had is called Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast.  My wife enjoyed her meal as well.  Prices are decent.  They also have a store as you enter so that you can get some gifts for others or things for yourself.  Cool spot.  They even sell furniture outside.  I saw a chair that I liked.  Cracker Barrel, we need you in Seattle!

The best Vietnamese in Phoenix, as it was the one we went to.  My wife and I had their pho tai nam and shared a plate of their broken rice dish special.  The pho tasted home cooked with some fat just like the one we made at home during Christmas.  The meat was done perfect and tender tasty.  The noodles were cooked good.  The ingredients were great.  The broken rice dish special came with 2 kinds of fish cake, egg cake and grilled pork.  Because the food took a while, I did not send it back, when there was a piece of hair on the egg cake (refer to my picture of it and zoom in on the top).  The dish was done perfectly.  The fish sauce was good.  Of course, I didn't eat the extra ingredient, I picked the area with hair and placed it on the table.  After we left the restaurant, we noticed it did not have shredded pork and pork skins.  But the dish was executed perfectly in all the meats, vegetables and rice.  The service was pretty good.  The conversations the staff had were in Cantonese and Vietnamese, so I am guessing the owners are Chinese from Vietnam.  A place to come back to.  The prices were cheap and decent.  I almost forgot, for this place, the food is good, but yes, you have to deal with their creepy restrooms.  I felt their restroom was similar to one that you would find in a hospital basement.

Some like it hot.. but some like it not (me)  Yes, I can't handle heat, but it doesn't mean the food has to taste flavorless right?  Man, my wife and I were looking for good Mexican food for the second straight night in Arizona.  This place was not, here's why..  I ordered their Roasted Pork Tostada w/ taco, as it was one of the few mild items on the menu that the owner or manager did not feel to even care about, as he took my wife's order (I forgot what she had) and then mine, he was like you can't hang with the big boys? and his attitude was like ok, whatever and when I got my meal, the food tasted to me like ok, whatever.  I mean, if the food doesn't have spices, you should at least have season in it, as it was completely bland.  Poor pork, it was roasted so well and the rest of the tostada and taco were done perfectly, but without seasoning (salt), it goes no where; it should not be allowed to walk outside, as it had no clothes on type of analogy.  They placed no care on their mild items and what's sad is Bobby Flay likes them.  On top of that, my wife's dish had the spices, but even that, hers lacked seasoning as well.  This place we would not come to again and Bobby Flay, I don't trust him anymore.  Oh yeah, the drinks were not that good.  I had the Sangria Margarita, don't let it fool you, it looked great and sounded great, but it tasted sour.  The wait staff were rude and they ignored our table a lot.  I understand they were busy, but hello, we are here.. do I need to set a trap for them to stand next to our table? like to be nice, super glue?  The waitress at the end accepted our gift card, but when it did not cover the whole amount, she acted like we couldn't pay.. what the heck? fool!  Thanks for the free Cheese Crisp, but man, it is just an unfolded cheese quesadilla.  Nothing special.

I was here!  Guy Fieri came earlier than me as well!  The best modern Mexican and first Mexican place we went to in Phoenix.  This place is a hit!  The service was slow and they forgot our drink orders a few times.  But the tequila they suggested was good.  Here comes the most important part.. their food.  We ordered their shark taco to share.  I had their El Gaucho Burro and my wife had their El Gaucho Quesa.  My wife is not a big quesadilla fan, but she liked it and it was so good when I tried it!  Her quesa had the perfect crisp texture to each bite.  My burro was excellent.  Since we both had El Gaucho, the fillings were the same ingredients.  Here's the climax.  They put cucumbers and bell peppers into their El Gaucho Burro and Quesa; that is a genius idea!  Those 2 ingredients brang out the taste of each individual ingredient from our burro and quesa.  Man, it was good!  Prices are good.  They have their own salsa bar.  I recommend their creamy cilantro salsa.  They also have good spicy ones as well.  A chips refill for your chips and salsa will cost you about $2?  Oh yeah, this place is pretty small.  They try to utilize as much as they can.  Very rare you will find Chinese eating Mexican, but I saw a few here.  Got to come here.

Last dinner in town before heading back to Seattle and we were looking for a place that was quick and nearby.  This is the place!  They have tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas and so on.  I had their chorizo taco and carne asada quesadilla and they were seasoned well and done perfectly.  Especially, the carne asada, it was moist, flavorful, all-around good with a little kick.  My wife had their burrito and taco in head and lengua meat and she liked hers.  I also had a Mexican bottle Coke which is always refreshing and good.  My wife's sangria out of the bottle drink was not good; we thought they made their own sangria.  If only Seattle had good Mexican food. (sighs)

Terrible sushi, good hot sake because.. how can you f up on sake?  We came here after our New Year's celebration next door, which was supposed to be a rooftop party that got rained out.  Well things happen, but we enjoyed that and afterwards walked from blistering cold to here for some food and drink.  Sushi bar closed, so hot sake only and we promised them we would come back the next day and we did.  Here's the review..  The customer service no doubt is really good!  We ordered their $12 Rainbow Roll.  Price is about right, as it usually cost that much.  The Roll came, the presentation looked really good with the special 'L-shaped' dish.  But, I immediately notice that the imitation crab was not mixed up with mayo in being broken up mixed with mayo and instead it was just a plain old imitation crab stick itself inside the roll.  Ok, fine.  First bite, it did not give me the heavenly feel, a good rainbow roll would give.  The fish tasted bland; poor quality fish.  The roll was bland all together.  They should have at least had mayo mixed into their imitation crab to at least give it some kind of flavor.  Tasted like Safeway sushi.  They probably did buy from Safeway and took it out of the case to earn a few extra bucks to sell here.  The roll was so cold.  RIce did not tasted fresh.  Horrible!  While we eating their sushi, I was thinking to myself, should I grade them like an actual sushi restaurant since I didn't pay attention to their full restaurant name on whether or not, they included sushi as part of their name, but yes, they do have sushi after Squid Ink.  So there, I can review them harshly.  If it wasn't for the customer service, I would have given them 1 out of 5.  I would not be back for their sushi; but drinks, yes.  I am not a sushi chef and I can make wayyyyyyy better sushi than this!
