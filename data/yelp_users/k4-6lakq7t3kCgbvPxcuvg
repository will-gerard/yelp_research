I took my littles here yesterday because I had purchased a Groupon for a membership and figured it was a good investment in my sanity when we didn't have other entertainment lined up for them.  There were a couple of hitches, but overall we had a good time.  Firstly, the membership desk process is smooth and easy, and because I purchased a membership for a family of 4 (but have 3 littles plus my husband, making us a party of 5) it was only an additional $10 on top of the Groupon to add another child.  I think that was a great deal!  Also, we parked in the Civic Center Garage by the Science Center and the membership desk validated our parking stub, making a typical $12 parking fee only $5 for the visit.  Secondly, the exhibits are FANTASTIC!  We didn't see everything there was to offer, but we viewed quite a bit and all of my kidlets had a blast.  FYI: The weather and natural forces exhibit on the 3rd floor was stupendous!   Lastly, we ate a late lunch at the Lab Cafe inside the Science Center, and the food was reasonably priced and pretty tasty: kids meals average about $5 each and adults are around $8 (both sans drinks).  But the flies that were continually buzzing around the dining room and our table were a MAJOR turn off for me and my little guy who's a bona fide germaphobe when it comes to flies landing near his food.  Also, the trashcan right by the exit door was literally overflowing with discarded drink containers, and in the course of 45 minutes I watched no less than 3 employees walk up and meticulously clean the glass doors right next to the overflowing trashcan, and not bother to empty the trash while they were there!  It was beyond odd.  0_o  PS:  Don't make the mistake we did by not bringing a stroller for the littlest one...  Daddy and I eventually got exhausted from carrying her everywhere, but as soon as we let her walk around on her own she was off like a SHOT and the place was so crowded we definitely would have lost her in the crowd.  :/  PPS: Speaking of the crowds, it was crazy busy yesterday, so a weekday visit would probably be much easier on your nerves.

Last January I was admitted to Good Sam by my perinatologist for an unknown emergency condition with my pregnancy at only 18 weeks pregnant and I spent 13 more weeks living on strict bed rest in the new axillary OBGYN wing.  My perinatologists said that my pregnancy was very complicated and because I was a HUGE hemorrhage risk, and in too perilous a position to go home, I HAD to stay there night and day, even though I only lived a couple of miles away.  They said I could be compared to a water balloon resting on a bed of nails.  Scary stuff!  It was the most challenging and depressing time of my life.  I couldn't go home to my 3 kids and husband (even though I could *almost* see my home from the parking garage roof), I couldn't prepare for my new baby because I didn't know if either one of us were even gonna make it.  I couldn't be home to prepare a nursery, plan a baby shower, get lunch with my girlfriends, go to work, NONE of that stuff.  It was SO depressing and scary for me.    Thankfully my team of doctors and surgeons and the wonderful OB (and later the ICU) nurses made my experience as pleasant as possible.   They took care of me physically, mentally and emotionally.  The nurses there are all sweethearts and I adored them, they went out of the way to make me at home.   They treated my husband and children like valued guests, and make the process of my kids visiting me as 'normal' as possible.  That was important to me since my kids were very concerned that I wasn't going to come home to them, and were utterly convinced that their baby sister definitely wasn't going to live.  Thankfully, we BOTH made it home alive thanks to the skilled doctors, surgeons and nursing staff that took care of us both at Good Sam and at the Phoenix Children's Hospital NICU inside of Good Sam that cared for the baby once she was born.  Also, I have to mention that my bedrest room in the OB Axillary wing was HUGE, and that is no exaggeration, it was seriously the biggest hospital room I have ever seen and would easily, comfortably hold a dozen or more visitors.    WOW!!    Now for the cons:  The food was really NOT very good, and I think this is where the hospital truly falls down on service.  I would routinely get bizarre, disgusting meals delivered to me, like a plain dry hamburger with a double helping of steamed carrots, no condiments at all.  WTF?   Or once they sent me a slab of dried up cold meatloaf (no gravy) and two plain baked potatoes, again no condiments.  Again, WTF?   And sadly the cafeteria food is NO better.  The food was greasy, mushy and /or tasteless and WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced.  (My mom spent 4 weeks at St. Joe's a few weeks before I was sent to Good Sam and I could see firsthand that St. Joe's cafeteria is SO much cheaper in comparison.)   Because of the dismal food options my family routinely brought me yummytastic meals from the outside, like Long Wong Hot Wings, Pink Champagne cupcakes from Barb's Bakery, hummus and pitas from Pita Jungle, Mexican food from Juliobertos...you know, yummy stuff.  :)   So for this alone I am deducting one star.  Also there is a VAST difference between the quality of rooms in the old part of the hospital and the newer OB rooms over in the axillary wing.  The difference is night and day, in fact.  The old rooms are minuscule in comparison to the new rooms.  In fact the old tower rooms practically require you to step outside to change your mind.     But the crappy food and tiny, old tower rooms aside, the hospital is GREAT.  The nursing staff is wonderful and the doctors are all top notch.  I wouldn't have gone anywhere else for the level of care and observation that I needed.  In fact, the staff here is so skilled that I understand from what I was told that, for what my particular condition was, I would have been flown to Good Sam for bedrest and delivery no matter where in Arizona we lived.  It was just random luck that we lived right down the road.   It is THE hospital to go to in Arizona for an extremely high risk pregnancy.  I will never be able to properly thank everyone who cared for us for those 13 agonizingly loooooong weeks at Good Sam, but I can only hope that giving them a great review will at least steer others to this wonderful facility.

I brought my husband and two of my littles here to see the Chihuly in the Garden exhibit and it was absolutely stunning. This exhibit was a MUST SEE.  (I say *was* because it ended last weekend and if you missed it then I do truly feel badly for you.)  We bought Groupon tickets for the exhibit and after one misfired attempt to visit it on a sold-out Saturday night, we finally made it in on Wednesday before the exhibit ended.  The customer service was stupendous, with each employee we encountered going out of their way to be gracious and helpful.    The gardens are meticulously manicured and beautiful and there are water fountains, park benches and trash receptacles along the walking paths.  Also, there was a mobile cash bar set up part way into the exhibit and my husband bought me the most delicious prickly pear margarita that was just the right size for sipping as I walked along and viewed the glass sculptures.  It's worth mentioning that my youngest son was so excited to see this exhibit that he kept bouncing around and kissing my arm and calling me the best mommy ever for bringing him.  I gave him my Smartphone and he used the various feature settings on my camera to take his own creative photos of the glass sculptures.    We had a great time and I only regret not being able to stay longer.  I understand that a Fairy World exhibit is coming up next at The Desert Botanical Gardens.  Perhaps a membership is in our future...?

So I came to Red Devil not sure what to expect and I left a big fan.    I ordered a glass of their house Riesling and was duly impressed with the bargain glass of wine.  It was very fruity , with just the right amount of dryness.    My husband ordered a large, thin crust cheese pizza and I ordered a spinach and strawberry salad with grilled chicken breast.  Now I am not one to brag about a salad, in fact it's very, very rare for me to even order a salad, but that night a salad made sense so I went ahead.  Man, am I glad I did...  It was the most amazing salad I've ever had.  EVER.  The chicken breast was a quality cut and grilled perfectly, and the salad greens were flavorful and crunchy and the strawberries were sweet, fresh and delicious and the whole salad was dressed in an amazing, light and tangy dressing that was almost non-existent in appearance, but exploded in flavor on the first bite.  I can't explain it better than that.  It was just the freshest, most flavorful salad ever.    My husband enjoyed his cheese pizza quite a bit as well, but he still found room to steal about half of my salad off my plate too!

I came in for a microdermabrasion session with McKenzie and had the best experience.  She was really sweet and friendly and she took the time to explain the process and to closely examine my skin.    She complimented me on my skin and told me that for someone of my age my skin was in awesome shape and that I merely needed to add more moisturizer to my daily regimen.  That was nice to hear since I always thought my skin was just average, but she assured me that my skin was in excellent shape.  (It's funny how the small things like that can make your whole day better.)  When the session was over my skin felt amazing and softer and it looked brighter and clearer.  When we were done she recommended a product to help me with a pigmentation issue and explained how to use it and how to care for my skin afterwards.  I'll definitely be back for more microdermabrasion sessions with McKenzie.

Wow, so the food here is pretty good, but the wait is silly.  I mean it, silly.  We ordered a pizza and the waiter immediately asked us if we knew it was at least 45 minutes for a thin crust and an hour for a deep dish?  Huh?  What in the name of God takes that long to assemble a pizza?  I can *almost* understand the long wait on a deep dish simply because of the cooking time, almost.  But 45 minutes for a thin crust (we're talking a crust so thin it's almost like a huge circular Saltine cracker) is friggen ridiculous.  Sorry, Oregano's, but that is just too long.  So rant about the ridiculous wait time aside, the food here is actually pretty good, and they can make a side of calamari like nobody's business.  It's delicious.  My toddler and I mowed through a serving of calamari and had enough to take home to snack on the next night.  I also had a mojito and it was very good, crisp, refreshing and yummy.  And as far as the pizza goes it was very good, and my husband throughly enjoyed it.  It was just the right amount of cheese and the crust was perfect.  Good pizza, awful wait.     Like my last sit-down dining experience this waiter also somehow managed to completely ignore the presense of my toddler and I finally had to ask him to get us a cup of water for her.  Rant Alert!  I seriously do NOT understand why wait staff ignore the babies and small children of paying patrons.  Yes, it's true that my two year old won't be tipping you, or placing a food order, or even mentioning her experience on Yelp, but her mommy sure as hell will, so at least acknowledge that when you take drink orders every living, breathing human being at the table probably needs their own beverage and may need to order their own food too.   Knowing the wait on the pizza I got clever and called over our waiter and asked him to put in an order for a pizzokie (sp?) for us, to go.  I explained that I couldn't make my toddler behave much longer and he graciously told me that he didn't mind noisy babies, which was great, except I bet all the patrons around us WOULD mind it if my daughter decided she was done being nice and was ready to start banging the salt shaker on the table while bellowing out 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' at the stop of her tiny lungs.  ;)  So after some puzzlement at my (apparently odd) request to take dessert to go he finally got it sorted out and we were able to pay and leave with our delicious dessert before the impending meltdown.  So all in all this was a nice visit, but that wait time on the pizza needs to be shortened.  Seriously!

My baby sister and I were pregnant at the same time last year, and my family was thrilled at the coincidence, so imagine my crushing disappointment when my pregnancy turned life threatening and I was sent to Good Samaritan Hospital for bed rest at only eighteen weeks!  That meant I was going to miss my little sister's baby shower! :(  That made me incredibly sad.  What made me even sadder was her tearfully explaining to me that the baby shower her (bossy) mother in law was organizing for her was a hot-ass mess, AND that her mother in law was refusing to provide a cake for the shower!  "Ah ha" I thought!  "I can save the day from my hospital bed AND provide a kick ass cake for her baby shower!  Yay!!"    So I called Karsh's because they have some of the most YUMMYTASTIC cakes I've ever tasted...  Well, my first call to Karsh's didn't go so well because the first employee I spoke to didn't seem too interested in helping me AT ALL (it was close to closing time apparently) so I decided to call back the next day.  On my second call to Karsh's I reached an employee who said he was a manager, so I explained to him that I was stuck in the hospital, but that I would like to order a baby shower cake for my little sister's baby shower in a couple of weeks and that I would pay for it over the phone with my credit card and that my husband would pick it up for me the day of the shower.  He said he would be happy to help me with this order.  I told him what size I needed and what flavors we'd like for the cake and then he asked me about a decoration for the cake and I told him that her baby shower theme was baby turtles and baby owls, and maybe could they do something with that theme in mind...?  He said 'sure' and I assumed that dealing with a professional bakery and all, that they'd do something nice within those parameters.    Holy Mary, Mother of God, was I dead wrong about THAT.   You see the day of the shower arrived and my husband ran over to Karsh's Bakery and picked up the cake (and trust me, it wasn't a cheap cake) and then he brought that big, pink bakery box over to my hospital room so that when my little sister popped in to see me before going to her shower, I could surprise her with a beautiful cake to take to her party.  Well, let me tell you what, my husband opened the tape sealing the edges of that pink bakery box so I could get a sneak peek and my face just froze in an expression of utter horror...  The idiots who decorated her cake over at Karsh's Bakery went and printed out an ugly black and green edible image of a giant sea turtle and plastered that monstrosity across the front of my sister's baby shower cake!!  And then in teeny tiny pink letters at the bottom of the photograph wrote "Welcome Baby Emma".  I have never cried so hard in my LIFE!!  I think my nurses were worried I was going to go into labor I was so upset and sobbing.  Seriously, I was a wreck.   I was crushed.  It was the ugliest, MOST disastrous mess you've ever seen.  I seriously cried for hours and I couldn't even look at my little sister when she came to my room to see what the "big surprise" was that I had for her that day.  I hid my face in my pillow quietly sobbing and pretended to be sleeping when she came by.  It was the most unprofessional thing you've EVER seen.  :(    We should have taken a picture of it for the cake wrecks blog, but I was so distraught that I didn't want to look at it anymore.  My family still put on a brave face and took that monstrosity to her baby shower, while I hid in my hospital room and sobbed, and while everyone who saw it all agreed it was hideous, they also said it was quite delicious.    Thankfully my sister was quite a good sport about it and thanked me profusely for the gesture.  I think she knew my intentions were good.  So there you have it; take it for what it's worth.  Karsh's makes delicious cakes, as long as you don't mind your 'adorable' baby shower cake looking like some Jacques Cousteau nature photograph out of a dusty old circa. 1960's textbook with some tiny, unprofessional greeting piped out frosting at the bottom of the ridiculous photograph.

I use Volvo Am I for my 2007 XC 70 and I am very happy with their service and prices.    The shop is clean and doesn't make me uncomfortable when I visit (sometimes with my kids in tow)...no nude centerfold pictures hanging in the work bays, or leering grease covered weirdos wielding wrenches and blasting death metal on their radio.  And they always get my car in quickly, tell me what it's going to cost me BEFORE starting the work, the prices are always fair and the work is well done.     Another big plus for me is that I never feel like I'm being lied to.  Some unethical mechanics think they can take advantage of a woman because it's automatically assumed that we're all ignorant about cars, and some of us are, but I'm not.  I like that they've never told me something outrageous like my turn signal fluid is low, or something that just seemed like they thought I didn't know any better.  I appreciate that I can expect that if they say I need it, I really do need it.    Anyway, I wouldn't hesitate to take your Volvo here, it's a nice shop and they really know their way around a Volvo.

I took my teenage daughter's 1996 960 here late this last summer because it wouldn't pass emissions due to both oxygen sensors (allegedly) being dead.  So I turn to the Volvo specialists I've used lots of times before for my own Volvo with few issues...except perhaps for the uncomfortable, stony silence they give you when your budget is bottomed out and you politely decline one of their suggested, additional services while embarrassedly explaining that you'll have to wait to get it done until you have more money.  Very uncomfortable.  So I'm thinking, no problem, these guys know their stuff, right? Apparently it *was* a problem, because after I made an appointment and dropped off my daughter's car, it took them 3 weeks and over $600 and the car STILL doesn't run!  :/   Adding to this, my husband and I had to call every few days and ask for an update on the car because we weren't being updated on the progress of the repair at all.  Have you ever had to placate an impatient 17 year old girl who needs her car to get to and from school?  It's living hell.  In fact, during one of the calls I made about the car's status, I discovered that they had replaced both oxygen sensors but that wasn't the problem, but they thought they had sorted out what the new hold up was but that nobody had gotten around to calling us to let us know any of this yet, and when I authorized them over the phone to address the new issue the response to me was "Well, we have all these other cars ahead of you now".  Wait...what?  Am I not ALSO a paying customer that also had an appointment?  How did I suddenly lose my place in 'line' behind all these other customers?  Shouldn't you finish my car before starting work on a different car?  :/  So yeah, after 3 weeks and over $600 they finally declared that they just didn't know what else to do with it and we paid our bill and picked up the car.  Fast forward a few months and it still hasn't passed emissions and just sits in my driveway, covered in dust, because I gave Volvo Am I all the money we could scrape together to sink into it and now I'm nervous to spend another penny since they couldn't figure it out the first time.     I'm not sure if I'm more offended that they thought we could afford repairs approaching half of the value of the car, or that we didn't deserve any follow up communications on the repair status, or that when I called to find out what was going on I discovered that we'd been dropped to the back of the line for no discernible reason whatsoever.  So yeah, I'm no longer a happy customer.

If you like crafting and sewing this is the place for you!  I needed about 6 yards of upholstery fabric as I am recovering my ratty old dining room chairs, and after some very frustrating searching through tables piled high with folded samples, old bolts and random yards, I nearly gave up then all of a sudden I found *exactly* what I was looking for: three different samples of Toile de Jouy, in pastel pink, green and blue!!  Yes!!   I was super excited to find it in all three colors.  And to add to the awesomeness of my find, my whole purchase, out the door, was only about $12.  Score!!    Be warned that this places is overflowing with fabric and sewing notions and finding exactly what you want can be a challenge, and their customer service is VERY limited.  But if you come in here with patience and lots of time to spare you will find exactly what you seek, eventually.

I needed the side window of my Volvo replaced ASAP and, true to their name, Speedy Glass was able to come out and do it the very next day.    The price was excellent and their installer (I think his name was Kyle?) was on time, friendly and professional.    Definitely recommended!

The best hot wings in the Valley.  Hell, in the World.  I love their hot wings.  I recently spent 5 months on bed rest in Good Sam Hospital (a very rough pregnancy) and my husband would have to go get me Long Wong's Hot Wings just to satisfy my intense craving for them.     What I like best about them is that they are well cooked so they aren't fatty, with big fat deposits in the chicken skin itself.  Nothing is grosser to me than biting into a chicken wing and getting a big mouthful of greasy, fatty flabby chicken skin.  YUCK.   Long Wong's wings are deep fried and come out meaty and chewy and little bit crispy.  Delicious!  Kinda like the perfectly browned skin on the Thanksgiving turkey, but covered in delicious hot wing sauce.  Someone once complained that they were similar to chicken jerky and I think that was a compliment!  The way they are cooked you can appreciate the meat and crispy skin and the sauce and you don't have to muck through a heavy breading or flabby, fatty chicken skin.    Their $5 cheese pizza isn't bad either.  And for some odd reason their fountain Pepsi is somehow more yummy than most fountain dispensed Pepsi at other restaurants.  I don't know if they can adjust the mixture and in this case they are running a stronger Pepsi mixture?  All I know is it's better than most places.  Good cheap food.  I like it.

Came here for pizza and wings last night and the quality was WAY off. :(    The pizza wasn't nearly as cheesy as normal and all the cheese wasn't even 100% melted, the crust seemed different that usual too.  Less doughy and fluffy and chewy and more like a thin, flavorless, store bought, pre formed crust.  (And I'm sorry, but if you run a special for a $6 12" pepperoni pizza and the customer asks for just cheese, why not drop the price a tiny smidge, considering that you aren't having to provide any pepperoni on their pizza?  Almost $23 for a small pizza, two dozen wings and one large Pepsi is kinda high.)  The wings also weren't up to par this visit.  They were badly overcooked, so much so that the drumsticks had all pulled away from the bone and shriveled into little balls of overcooked cooked chicken at the end of the drumstick.  (I can't think of any other way to describe it...)  I like my wings well cooked (like chicken jerky) but last night's wings were just ridiculously overcooked.  They were also woefully skimpy on the sauce, and too boot the butter that makes up the base for my beloved Long Wong's mild wing sauce was kinda off too.  It tasted a tad rancid.  Not enough to make me not eat the wings, but still I could tell it wasn't very fresh like it normally tastes.  It made me pretty sad.  Adding to all that the damn Pepsi wasn't as rich and syrupy and delicious as normal.  This time I could CLEARLY taste the carbonated liquid underneath the Pepsi syrup, and the carbonation was the dominant flavor.  They obviously changed the ratio at the fountain drink dispenser.  (WTF??)  Overall this visit was extremely disappointing.  EXTREMELY.  I am a huge Long Wong's fan, and I live right down the street so I tend to come here a lot, but after last night's visit I am not sure when or if I'll be back...  Long Wong's Management, heed my words.  If a die-hard regular like me is contemplating finding another wing place, you need to take a good, hard look at what you've changed and CHANGE IT BACK.  Whatever penny pinching you did with the pizzas was NO BUENO.  Also, the stinginess on the wing sauce and the Pepsi mixture was not a good move either.  Those were THE things that we loved about your restaurant, and would come and brave the less-than-sparkling-clean conditions at your establishment to enjoy.  If you kill the food quality by skimping on cheese, using some crappy pizza crust, being stingy with wing sauce (ON WINGS!  The VERY THING you are known for!!  DO NOT TAMPER WITH A FAN FAVORITE!) and the syrup mixture on the fountain dispenser then there is almost no way I am braving that frenetic, overcluttered, hot ass mess of dining room restaurant to come back.  Normally I can ignore all that junk on the walls while I savor the delicious food, but now that the food isn't distracting me, I can hardly ignore the random junk dangling from the walls and ceiling.  I am willing to bet you that others will agree here.  You may have saved a little on the ingredients that you just cheaped out on, but it'll cost you a ton in lost repeat business over time.  Penny wise, pound foolish.  Please change it back!

I am happy to report that after some quality hitches that I mentioned in my last review, Long Wong's is back to good!!    I've been in several times since my last review and each time the pizza and Pepsi were perfect and the wings were amazeballs.  Seems they took note of the issues and corrected them, good on them!  If you haven't had Long Wongs wings then you really should try them.  In my humble opinion they beat all the other wing places, hands down.

I come here all the damn time for the various things I need to create the elaborate cakes and edible creations I like to make in my spare time.    Need a grass icing tip?  Got them. Need a flower nail?  Got them too. How about pre-made, colorful gum paste and Royal Icing flowers?  Yep, got them as well. Looking for a Scooby Doo cake topper?  Yep, along with most all other well know cartoon characters. Would you like some molded sugar Hello Kitty cake decorations?  Right here. Need some cotton candy flavored food extract?  Yes. A 10" round cake pan and lidded cake box?  Right over there. Want some disposable candy boxes for making homemade truffles?  Right down that aisle. Care for a book on making professional cake pops?  Right here. Pale mint frosting tint?  Next to the tubs of premade buttercream icing. Candy melts in bright yellow?  On the same aisle as the iridescent lustre dust. Need a bride and groom cake topper?  Got them. Need a groom and groom, or bride and bride cake topper?  Got them as well.  Seriously folks, if you've ever been even remotely interested in cake decorating, candy making, baking cupcakes, and any and all other types of confections, baked goods and pastries you've got to check this place out; it makes the cake decorating aisle at other combination craft stores jealous.

Not a bad craft store IF you can find parking!!    They aren't very big, but they do carry pretty much all the craft items that most ladies would gravitate towards. (But honestly the men have a bigger selection of model kits, science projects and RC items over at Hobby Lobby)    They also have great coupons that, if you can abide by the extremely tricky fine print terms and conditions and restrictions, offer some great deals on singular items.  Occasionally they also offer a coupon good for a percentage off of your whole order, but like I said their coupons are tricky and restrict a lot of what you can get.  Be alert when deciding what item to apply your coupon to.  After being burned a couple times I've even gone so far as to buy my singular pricier item with my coupon in one transaction and then buy all my other stuff in a separate transaction, that way my coupon was applied to the item *I* chose, not a lower dollar item that the cashier chose to make the discounted item.    Also, another tip to maximize your Michael's bang for the buck is to hit up their store a few days before a major holiday and right after that holiday so you can pick up inexpensive items for the holiday on sale, and even more holiday items on the cheap to put away for next year.  But yeah, back to the parking...  The parking at this whole shopping center sucks butt.  Avoid it all all costs around the major shopping days like Black Friday or Christmas Eve!  Consider yourself warned.  ;)

Nope, nope, nope.  I came here on the recommendation of other fellow Yelpers and I am so disappointed.  Firstly, parking is a mess.  Next, I came with my husband and two year old daughter and the hostess told me that they don't have a high chair that can accommodate a two year old so she had to use a booster seat.  The problem is that she's at that middle age where she's almost done with high chairs and still too immature for a booster seat.  What a mess trying to keep her in her booster seat and contained.  She wasn't noisy or badly behaved, per se, she just wanted to stand up in the booth and look around and fidget with all the condiment bottles on the table.  Also, can I mention that the booths have a weird half wall that obscures the other diners from the chest up, but is open from the chest level down, so someone in the other booth could easily reach underneath the wall and dig around in your purse if they wanted to, or your two year old can peek underneath the booth wall to play peek-a-boo with the diners on the other side?  It's pretty weird.  So the waitress came over took our drink orders with a minimum of small talk (or overall friendliness).  We perused the menus.  My husband chose a beef brisket sandwich.  I wanted a t-bone steak, I had been craving one and I was looking forward to it.  We ordered our dinners and it's worth mentioning that at NO point did the waitress acknowledge that presence of our daughter.  She never asked us what she wanted to eat or if she needed anything to drink either, apparently she was invisible.  Seeing as how there weren't any kids meals on the menu, I just assumed we'd feed her from our own plates, but interestingly the waitress just assumed that too because she didn't even ask if she'd be having a side order of something as her meal,  She just looked right past her.  If I sound pissed it's because I was.  I don't need the waitress to pinch her cheeks and make baby talk with her, but to merely acknowledge the fact that there were three human beings sitting at the booth that night would have been covered in 'Basic Manners 101'.  So my steak was very flavorful and tender but BADLY undercooked, terribly fatty and a sickly color gray.  (It didn't have a nice sear or a good caramel color to it.)  I ordered it medium rare, but instead I got bloody, almost blue meat.  And there was so much fat that I only got about half meat, the rest was all scrap fat and the bone.  My sides were non-descript.  I think my mashed potatoes were probably decent, I honestly can't even remember that's how non-descript they were.  The roll and bread 'basket' that came with my food (one little roll and one little cold biscuit) were hard and tasted store bought.  And my hungry toddler didn't even want them.  My husband's beef brisket sandwich was a pathetic, dried out, flavorless waste of good money.  We didn't even bother with desserts.  I had a margarita; it was very good, but beguilingly strong for how petite the rock glass is that it was served in.  After I finished it the waitress came around and asked me if I wanted another and I declined, but my husband (a non-drinker) immediately piped up and said "Yes, she'll have another!" and shot me a playful look, and rather than looking to me so see if I *really* wanted another $7 margarita or not she simply walked away and had the bartender make me another one!  WTF?  So within a couple of minutes I had yet another very, very strong margarita sitting in front of me.  Now I'm no cheapskate but I don't like to waste money so I choked down that second margarita and it was the proverbial 'straw that broke the camel's back'.  I may have finished it, but it definitely finished ME.  I spent the rest of the night stumbling and mumbling to myself about someone slipping me a mickey.  I've never, ever had a margarita that strong and I am a very well seasoned drinker.   What of Earth did they put in them??  So to sum it up I spent over $60 (includes the tip) for 2 small Molotov cocktails disguised as margaritas, an undercooked, fatty, t-bone steak, an inedible, dry beef brisket sandwich and a big serving of NOTHING for my child.    Never again.  The two stars are for the flavor and tenderness of the otherwise failure of a steak and the extreme value for your money on the alcohol.  THAT'S IT.

This Goodwill is a disgusting, stinky, disorganized, picked over mess.  I have never found something that was even worth the trip here.     Skip this one and go to the one at 16th Street and Indian School Road.    Trust me, you'll thank me later.

Others must have agreed since this location has blessedly been shut down and moved to a new location on the other side of the same strip mall.    And, for what it's worth, the new location of this store is MUCHO BETTERO!  I go here a lot now and I love the new location!  Thank you for closing the old one and opening the new one!

Damnitt Ulta!  Why can't you stock ALL of your product at the Ulta cosmetic table reliably??    I have received more than a few Ulta gift certificates from my husband as gifts and I always get burned when I go in to redeem them; needing X, Y and Z, but only being able to find X in a shade darker than I use, and Y is out of stock, and I can find 4 tubes of Z, but they are all testers and have already been opened.    I like Ulta's cosmetic line and would use it exclusively, but it it's impossible to fill my cosmetic bag with Ulta's stuff because they are apparently incapable of keeping the inventory stocked and organized!  How hard is it to have a few of each item and color and ONE tester??    Adding to the frustration is that when you have to backfill your cosmetic bag with other cosmetic brands (that you couldn't test the colors on because they don't have testers) and you are pretty much screwed out of $11 if you get home and discover that a Revlon True Beige is not remotely the same color across the board in their different foundation lines.  Aaargh!  Oh, and their coupons have so many product exclusions that's it's actually kinda funny, kinda like a game to see what you actually can use their coupons on...not much.  The only good thing that I noticed on my last visit to Ulta was that they are now offering an extensive selection of name brand rollerball perfumes, so now I don't need to get a huge bottle of my favorite Calvin Klein Euphoria perfume for my purse, I can get it in a handy little $20 rollerball.  So yay for that!   Finally, the parking here sucks.  Protip: I suggest you park over by Fry's on the other side of the block.  Otherwise use the Ulta in Chandler for better parking.

Our family LOVES 5 & Diner.  I have two little boys who are 5 and 7 and they get so excited to go to 5 & Diner and put quarters in the miniature jukebox at the table and wear the paper 5 & Diner caps they get with their color-on menu and crayons.    I love the service and the ambience.  It's easy to imagine I'm transported back to the 1950's when my own parents were in high school and times seemed simpler...even though I doubt they were actually any simpler.  I remember coming to 5 & Diner in the wee hours of the night after my friends and I left the nightclubs back in the early 1990's.  We'd sit in the booth wearing our black leather jackets and fashionable club attire, and pound down cigarettes (you could still smoke in there then, but not now...THANK GOODNESS) and drink cup after cup of hot coffee while devouring plates of strawberry covered waffles and heaps of bacon.  (Those were the days.)    Anyway, I took the family last weekend and was surprised that they recently changed their menu and the dinner entree I was looking forward to ordering was gone.  (Major bummer.)   It looked like they changed the whole menu since my last visit and I'm still not sure I love the new menu, it'll take a couple of more visits before I have a verdict on that...I know for sure if they got rid of their eggs benedict I'll be scarred for life!  You need to go to 5 & Diner if you are into nostalgia, it's a wonderful place with great service that makes me wistful for a time that came and went a full 20 years before I was even born.    Now lets just see if the new menu sucks or not...

I LOVE Arriba's food.  It's flavorful, plentiful, affordable and varied.  There are only a couple of Mexican food restaurants that I will go to (as a native Arizonan I have high standards for good Mexican food) and I think that Arriba's is just about as good as you can possibly get for a chain Mexican restaurant.  In my humble opinion it's a tad better than Garcia's, and FAR better than Macayo's.  The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that the restaurant itself is starting to show its age around the edges and you can see the wear and tear in the decor itself.  I think it's time for the owners to shut it down for a day and do a massive floor to ceiling deep cleaning and give it some fresh paint.  Then they'll deserve 5 stars.  :)

This place has everything you could need if you are doing your own hair or your own waxing.  It's truly a dream come true for hard to come by beauty supplies and at a very reasonable price, but it is hella crowded!  Seriously, you have to think skinny thoughts just to scoot past other people in the aisles!!    Anyway, all that aside, they have everything, and I was helped by a very sweet employee on my visit who found me just what I needed (a Brazilian hair straightening kit that worked like a charm) and rang up my purchase at the register, and then afterwards she took me back into the aisles to show me another item I mentioned needing to find just as I was about to walk out the door with my purchase.    Well played customer service, young lady!  Well played!

My husband took my car here for a basic full service oil change for $32.99, but apparently that doesn't include the oil (an extra $3) or a filter (an extra $5) so really a full service oil change is 40.99 if you want oil and an oil filter included in that oil change.  For that price I could have gone to a real lube joint and gotten good, synthetic stuff.  Oh, and the Works Car Wash didn't include vacuuming out the handful of crushed pretzels that my toddler had deposited in the door handle of the backseat.  How on Earth did their employees miss that??  Or maybe vacuuming out ALL of the stuff in the car is extra?  Yep, that must be it.  My husband just wasn't approached by the standard pushy employee selling the 'extra' service of having ALL of the debris and crumbs vacuumed out of the car...  I think we're done with Danny's.  The pushy upsell and then overpriced, crappy results seems to be a recurring theme with them.

Their cheese pizza is so good we order it every Friday night for dinner, and trust me, my husband is some kind of cheese pizza connoisseur.  I think he would live off of it if he could.  Anyway, rain or shine he's calling them to get 2 cheese pizzas every single weekend.  They are cheap (like $6), hot, cheesy, the good kind of melty, salty, heavenly mozzarella deliciousness that comes off in big gooey strings.  The sauce is flavorful and the crust is DELICIOUS.  I am not a huge fan or pizza and I even like their cheese pizza.   Yummy!

Always good take-away Mexican food!    We come here all the time and on this particular visit I got a grilled shrimp salad with avocados, onions, tomatoes, lettuce and bell peppers.  My husband got a huge bean and cheese burrito and our young daughter got the carne asada fries; crisp french fries smothered in delicious carne asada, cheddar cheese, guacamole and sour cream.  (Shhh...don't tell anyone, the carne asada fries were really for mommy, that healthy salad was just a ruse..)  Everything was hot and delicious, as usual.  We love this place!

Picked up a half dozen assorted cupcakes yesterday.  Once again they are delicious!  I got a bananas foster, two Cosmo cupcakes, a pumpkin cupcake, an Orange Dreamsicle cupcake, and a plain old vanilla cupcake.  They were soft, moist and the frosting was smooth and creamy..awesome.   I spent about $14.00 for the six cupcakes and it was well worth it.  I also noticed they are updating and remodeling the place, and it looks very, very cute!  This is MY all time favorite cupcake place in all of the metro Phoenix area, it should be yours too.

I came here and got a cake for my teenage daughter's 18th birthday.  I meant to make it special and bake her a cake, but we were leaving for Disneyland the next morning and I simply ran out of time to contend for the 'Mom of the Year' awards in my house, so I did the next best thing and I went to Barb's Bakery to get a cash and carry cake.    Since there were only 6 of us at her little party I opted for a new offering at Barb's; miniature 6" cakes for around $12.  It was a beautiful, pure white cake with elegant white roses and piped drapes and beading.  It was a sight to behold in its monochromatic simplicity!  My daughter was very impressed with her tiny creation in pure white.    The only drawback about the cake was the taste of the frosting, it didn't have any kind of a special flavor, like Barb's cakes normally do, it was just plain and sweet.  Not even a vanilla flavor.  This seems odd for Barb's so I'm almost wondering if someone forgot to add vanilla flavoring to that frosting batch?  If it's on purpose then I'd politely suggest adding some kind of extract to the frosting as it just needs something more to really take it from a simply 'good' cake to a 'delicious' cake.    Just my two cents!  Otherwise my little cake was perfect and my daughter thought it was beautiful, thanks!

My husband and I came here in late August and the weather was threatening a monsoon right as we arrived, so the restaurant interior was jam packed, I convinced the hostess that we really were okay with the risk of getting wet and she let us sit on the empty patio, which was blessedly deserted.  Our bet paid off as it didn't storm on us and instead we got to enjoy the light show and blowing trees overhead as we noshed on a mixed bruschetta board and a pub board.    I'm a big fan of their bruschetta combinations, they really have a beautiful way of combining sweet and savory ingredients in a way you wouldn't expect, but surprise your taste buds nevertheless.  I enjoyed a peach Bellini while my husband, who doesn't drink, had a really delightful cucumber honey lemonade.  As unusual sounding as it is, it's really quite amazing.    This is such a nice place for an evening out, sans children.  If you haven't been yet you really MUST check it out; go now!

Two words:  Prosciutto With Brie on Focaccia Bread.    Okay, that was a lot more than 2 words, but I don't care.    It was downright amazing; like my tastebuds were being dry humped by the best sandwich ever invented in the History of the World (Part II).

I came in here around 2 PM this last Saturday afternoon with my husband and our 2 year old daughter.  We were in the market for a storage shed for our surplus belongings so we could empty out our guest house (currently used as storage rooms) and let our teenage daughter move out into the guest house.  I definitely wanted something better than one of those flimsy metal storage sheds that you assemble yourself, and I already knew that Tuff Shed makes VERY sturdy storage buildings.  The Tuff Shed store on Illini Street has a spacious indoor showroom, so thankfully we didn't need to spend any time outside because the specific units we were most interested in were already assembled inside the air conditioned showroom.   As soon as we walked in we were greeted and offered ice cold water by our salesman, David Haines; he was very friendly and seemed like a straight shooter.  At no point did I feel like he was just some slick, salesman.  He seemed to really understand that pricing was critical for us and that (unfortunately) our budget wasn't very flexible, but that we still wanted a Tuff Shed quality building.  He advised us on the features that we could add after the fact to help keep the overall cost within our budget and I really appreciated that.  David walked us through the pros and cons and the features and costs of each of the sheds that we expressed interest in, and he was also immensely helpful in helping us entertain our overactive 2 year old while my husband and I consulted each other and examined the sheds in detail. In fact, our little daughter was absolutely in love with the little children's play house that they offered for sale in the show room and if I had enough extra money in my budget I would have definitely purchased one for her; it was really cool and she would have been over the moon to have one of her own.  With our salesman's advice my husband and I eventually settled on a shed that was even bigger than what we had originally planned on getting for just a little extra money.  David helped us pick out the features for our shed and we did the paperwork and paid for the shed and were in and out of there in about an hour.  The whole process was simple and straightforward and the price was absolutely reasonable for the quality of the building.  Our shed is being installed this coming Friday and I am really looking forward to it.  I will be sure to update my review with pictures once the shed is built!

Yuck.  Went here today for lunch.  The cashier didn't give me a receipt and I didn't remember the order number he mumbled at me.    I kept sending my husband up to check to see if the food being randomly handed out was ours, there was a huge group of people standing around also waiting for their food.  After almost 15 minutes our food finally was ready, although I can't understand the delay since neither one of us got any hot food that needed to be cooked.    The large Greek Salad ($5.50) I got was horrible.  It was dressed with a red wine vinagrette (???) and was inedible.  What a waste of money.  That was NOT a Greek Salad.  My husband got the vegetable plate ($9.25) and choked down as much as he could.  The sole piece of Spanokopita (?) was mushy and soggy from sitting in a puddle of some red vinagrette dressing.  The Greek olives were mushy and the bread looked stale.  We picked at our food and finally threw it out in disgust.  (We went to Circle K down the road and each got Hostess cupcakes to snack on instead.)   YUCK!!  I won't be back

I took my staff here for a happy hour retirement party for our boss.    The service was prompt and attentive, the ambiance was nice, with soft lighting and non-intrusive music playing in the background, and the meat and cheese platters and bruschetta I ordered were all delicious.    This was a hit with the staff and I can easily see coming back here for another event soon.

I'm torn on this review, I want to trash them over some bad experiences I've had, but overall they are an okay store with a good selection of merchandise and the, occasional, great deal on clearance items.    I remember a few years ago when I attempted to order the nursery furniture for my baby it was a comedy of errors that literally mirrored the 'Cheese Shop' skit by Monty Python, minus the British accents (and the cheese.)  Me-"Do you have this dresser in stock?"  Employee-"No sorry, Ma'am, we don't carry that style any longer."  Me-"Okay, what about this changing table you have as the floor model, can I get one of those?"  Employee-"No, our supplier never delivers those on a Wednesday, sorry Ma'am."  Me-"Okay, do you have any cribs in stock?"  Employee-"Again, I apologize profusely Ma'am, but it appears we are all out of those as well..."  Me-"Tell me, do you in fact have ANY baby furniture at all?..."  But all that aside, and keeping in mind this was a few years ago I'm actually not subtracting any stars for it.   Just thought I'd mention it as it was as annoying as heck and still sticks in my mind.    So, anytime anyone in our office welcomes a new baby, or grand baby, we take up a collection and I head over here to get them a gift card and a package of diapers as a gift from everyone at the office.  In the 5 years I have worked here I've done this at least 10 times and probably spent upwards of $2,000 on Babies R Us gift cards.  This is over and above what I have spent on goods and gear for my own two little ones.   So to summarize, I have dropped a ton of money in here.    Imagine my delight when I recently got an emailed statement for my Babies R Us Rewards card telling me that for the first time ever my shopping trips (presumably) in the last year calendar had earned me a bonus reward!  "Yes!!  Score!  All that money I have spent in here and finally it pays *me* back in some tangible way!"  What is my reward amount I wonder?   Maybe a $20 gift card, a big fat rebate, some too-good-to-be-true percentage off coupon?  I wonder...  I opened the email to get the details.  Ladies and Gents; I was the proud recipient of a $1 coupon that expired in one month.  As my father always told me, "Now don't spend it all in one place!"   Uh yeah, I deleted the stupid $1 coupon email.  WTF?  REALLY Babies R Us, really?  So last week I needed to go and get another gift card for a co-worker, and this time when the cashier asked me if I had a Babies R Us Rewards Card I wanted to scan for points I just laughed bitterly.  She was very nice, and I guess that wasn't a very polite response on my part, but I couldn't help it, it was a reflex response.  C'mon BRU, if you are gonna offer rewards for people to shop in your store make them REAL rewards, not silly $1 off coupons.  Okay, I guess my rant is mostly over.  This is a decent store, it's clean, the staff is nice and you can *usually* get what you want when you want it (as long as it isn't nursery furniture) but I think their rewards system is a total joke.

Not a bad lunch.  Pros:   The food was flavorful, hot and cheap The shrimp chevice tostada was DELICIOUS   Cons: The location is too small and the line was literally all the way to the door and there is no convenient place for those waiting for their food to stand.  Very awkward. I didn't like the seasoning on the carne asada street tacos.  I wanted to taste the meat without some unexpected, red seasoning on it.  It was too spicy and when I order carne asada I usually expect it to come unseasoned, or at least without some weird red seasoning all over it.  (That's not what the carne asada street tacos I get in Mexico taste like; they are served unseasoned with shredded cabbage, a lime wedge and some pico de gallo.)  Anyway, aside from the super crowded place and the weird carne asada street taco, I did like it.  I'll be back for more of those delicious, shrimp cevice tostadas.

I don't know why, but when I get a migraine (sadly, that's sorta often) ice cream helps dull the pain.  I'm really not a huge ice cream fan, but like I said when my head is pounding, ice cream is a great non-narcotic pain releiver.    So I had a migraine this particular day and I came in to get a scoop of Daquri Ice and the young man behind the counter was just so friendly and helpful.  He really was awesome.  While I was there I decided to pick up a couple of pints for my freezer for later, and I am glad I did since I definitely needed them!

I called these guys anxious to get my newly replaced get my rear passenger window tinted to match the rest or the car before I left for a week long vacation to Mexico, in the car, the next day.    Not only did I not want my car to look goofy with one un-tinted window, when the rest of my windows are all very dark, but I also didn't want my grade school age son, who always sits on that side of the car, sitting in a blazing hot, un-tinted car seat.    Not only did they tell me to come right over and they'd do it, but they were able to match my existing tint almost perfectly and the whole rush job only cost me about $55.  They had a nice, air conditioned waiting room with free bottled waters, for me to relax in as I waited for them to finish my car and the whole process only took about 30 minutes.    I was very pleased!

The biggest and coolest Asian grocery store in the Valley.  Okay, okay, maybe not the Valley, but of all the Asian grocery stores that *I've* been to in the Valley.  And their prices are very reasonable so you can easily afford to be adventurous and try new things.  Not only do they have products from all the Asian countries, but they have products from many other countries too.  Canned goods, household items, bakery, frozen, fresh seafood and meats, a huge produce section. You name it, they probably have it.

We brought our kids for some old fashioned skate time.  My boyfriend wont/can't skate, so it was just me, and our 4 kids paying to skate and the skate rental.    They now mandate that you wear super uncomfortable plastic wrist guards, this wasn't a thing when I used to go to skating rinks when I was younger. My littlest needed a trainer and I inquired about one, but they didn't have one.  (Oh, to clarify, they've got about 20 of them, but none of them were available.  And the only way to get one was to lurk at the counter and see if someone turned one in and rent it really quick before someone else did.  Great system.)    That was fun trying to help a wiggly 5 year old get around on skates, while I'm also on skates, and wearing an lawsuit-guard, nanny state wrist binder on each hand.  Can't I have just signed a disclaimer...like the good old days?  Ugh.  Oh, and the impossible wrist guards, coupled with my wiggly 5 year old on roller skates and my inability to grasp her and steady myself caused ME to crash hard to the floor.  (Do they make a plastic and Velcro, whole-body hip guard for us old farts who crash to the ground too?)  So after several minutes of getting used to her roller skates I finally lead my little one out onto the rink (the older 3 kids were gone like shots out of a cannon) and we weren't out there more than a few minutes before we had to come back in because the DJ said they were doing some special event on the rink, and then we went back out.  Oops!  They were now doing *another thing* that required us to come back in...  It happened one more time, then I gave up.  My boyfriend patiently sat and watched us and then ordered food and drinks. (He's a saint.) The kids eventually got bored and went off to play video games with him and I was asked to wait for our pizza to be called,  I watched, and watched and watched. Nobody called us.  At some point a teenage counter employee took a pizza and placed it into a warming display case, but nobody called our order.  Finally my boyfriend comes back.  "Where's the food?"  "They haven't called us yet."  "WTF??"  He walks over there to inquire.  "Oh yeah, we called you but nobody responded."  B.S!!  I sat there at a table 15 feet away watching you, waiting eagerly to be called.  *mad face*  Anyway, all that drama aside, we ate, we drank our sodas and then heard the announcement that they were closing early due to some private parties so we had to leave soon.  We'd only been there a couple of hours and had no clue they were closing so early!  So all of the kids quickly queued up at the ticket counter to turn in their tickets earned from the use of overpriced tokens in games, generously bankrolled by dad, and we stood there and stood there....  The teenage guy working the counter was completely overwhelmed and it took him almost 30 minutes to take care of all of the kids that came at him all at once.    All of that time wasted waiting for a .3 cent plastic bracelet, an Army man, and a couple of Tootsie Rolls, that probably cost dad $10 in tokens.  We left shortly afterwards, about $100 poorer, but enriched with the 'priceless memories'...and one nasty hip bruise.   (And a .3 cent bracelet or two.)

How do you even review your local blood bank???  "They are much gentler drawing blood here than the waitress is over at IHOP.  She always bruises my arm."  "The donor chairs are much more comfortable than the lobby chairs at Jiffy Lube."  This is such a specialized service provider that it's hard to review it, but it's a good one.  They haven't hurt me or done me wrong.  So, it's where I repay my debt to society.  No, no, not like community service or some court mandated repayment thing... Five years ago I received almost 8 units of blood after a massive surgery, basically keeping me alive, so *this* is how I pay back my debt of gratitude.  (Plus, the chairs here are so much more comfy than the Jiffy Lube lobby chairs.)

I routinely order Jason's Deli sandwich and wrap trays for working lunches at my office.  Ordering from their online site is a cinch and delivery is always a few minutes early, or on time to the minute.  Their delivery drivers are also professional and friendly as well.    The food is always fresh and delicious each and every time, and it always comes with all the plates, napkins, utensils, ice, cups and other accoutrements needed to serve it too.  Among my personal favorite items from Jason's are their wraps, and in particular their vegetarian wrap with mushrooms, Asiago cheese, bell peppers and Romaine lettuce).  Their Chicken Alfredo pasta is just amazing for lunch on a cold day and another favorite item for a cold day is their Tomato Basil soup which is absolutely delicious and served with a side of soft bread.    Another big plus about catering from Jason's Deli for work lunches is that you accumulate 'Deli Dollars' with each order and over the course of a year's worth of office lunches I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars to pay for all the food for my teenage daughter's 15th birthday party.  Then by the next year I had accumulated enough Deli Dollars once again to cater the food my baby daughter's 1st birthday.  It was wonderful to be able to hold each birthday party for the girls and not have to worry at all about preparing the food.  I had Jason's Deli catered in today and the only thing wrong with today's lunch was that the pasta salad was very oily (which isn't normal for them) but aside from that I have absolutely no complaints about today's lunch delivery...  Rock on Jason's, rock on.

I came here recently for a special occasion dinner with my office staff and it was very nice.  The restaurant itself is well designed, with muted colors, dark woods and dimmed lighting.  The wait staff was neatly presented in crisp white shirts and clean, black service aprons.  We prearranged for a pre-printed dinner menu that was labeled as being for our party that night.  I thought that it was a nice touch, and I am well aware that it was also a clever cost containment measure since it also kept our staff from wildly ordering off of the regular Fleming's menu.  Our servers were all very gracious and attentive and took very good care of our party of about 25.  Our food was all brought out at the same time, which was no small feat on the kitchen's part.  Everyone seemed genuinely happy with their food, I didn't see anyone complaining about anything.    I ordered the petite filet, medium rare, and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The meat was cooked perfectly and was tender, moist and delicious.  There were various sides served 'family style' raging from buttered corn to asparagus, and they were all very good as well.  As a dessert I ordered crème brulee, and it was deliciously creamy with the perfectly sugar crust on top.  My only complaint about my food, and it is minor, was that the crème brulee wasn't the ice cold temperature that I usually prefer.  I like my crème brulee pre-fired so that it has time to cool off before I eat it.  I don't care for warm custard, but it's purely a personal preference and I still thought the dessert was fantastic.  The only other thing I would point out is that many people aren't fans of the a la carte menu system, it can be annoying, and ridiculously expensive, to order every side dish seperately from the main entree.     That said, this was still a great experience in a wonderful restaurant.  I highly recommend it for any special occasion dinner as long as your budget will allow it.

I too felt scammed after purchasing a $125 Living Social voucher to this company for a Porsche 911 driving experience for my husband's birthday.    These guys made just ONE race date for, wait for it, the exact same day the voucher expired in June!  (What a coincidence!) Well we signed up for that date online, as instructed, and then we waited for the day to arrive.   A few days prior they sent an email, not even a courtesy call to make sure you got it, letting everyone know that because it was "too hot" in June they were postponing the race day until 'sometime' in the Fall.  Unfortunately my husband's junk folder gobbled up that postponement email and he took the time off work and drove clear out to their abandoned looking track in the far West Valley the day of the scheduled race only to find that nobody was there, there was no note on the door, the parking lot was full of weeds and nobody was answering their phones at their corporate offices in Scottsdale either!!   Way to instill confidence in your company, folks.  Until he found that postponement email in his junk folder we were certain they'd simply gone out of business!  Also, can I just ask, weren't they **already** well aware that it is routinely hot in June in the Phoenix Metro area?  Seriously????  It wasn't even record heat, just normal June heat.    That flimsy excuse alone made it clear to us that this cancellation was pre-planned on their part.  Sell the vouchers and collect the customer's money NOW and then cancel the bogus race date and reschedule it, maybe, or so far out in the future the customers probably can't make it.  Oh, and make damn good and sure you push it out past the cancellation date on the voucher, that way they have no recourse through Living Social either!  Very clever scam, you guys...  Well, after a couple of months of waiting with no word from them on when the new race date was, my husband called and dealt with one of the rudest people ever, who brusquely cut him off and talked down to him all because my husband had the audacity to ask them for a specific date in the Fall when they were going to hold the replacement event so we could plan for it.  They were nothing but evasive about the date for the replacement race, so all we could do was wait and see.    They eventually decided to send an email about the replacement date in early November, and they only gave us about a week's advance notice of the race date on Saturday, November 9th.  As it turns out, it was the exact same date and time as our son's final Little League game, so we immediately replied to their email and explained the conflict and asked about a possible second date but they didn't reply.    Finally, the race day was the next day (and still no reply) so my husband called them and explained the problem and they said that was the one and only replacement date and if we couldn't make it our $125 voucher was forfeited...what they wanted to happen all along, I'm sure.    We asked them if we could give it to a friend to go in my husband's place and they begrudgingly agreed, as long as we signed the voucher over to him.  So my husband wrote a note right on the voucher saying that he was giving it to our friend and he signed it and we gave the friend all the paperwork.  But that was apparently not good enough for them, because when our friend showed up to redeem the voucher the next morning they tried to turn him away because he hadn't brought a signed letter WITH a photograph of my husband's drivers license.  (WTF?!?)  Lucky for our friend we were able to send a photo of a quickly written letter and my husband's license to him via Smart phone and they *finally* acquiesced and let him use the voucher.  Oh and our friend wasn't exactly impressed with the experience, he said it was too restrictive and you really weren't able to get the car to a decent speed.    So take it from me folks, doing business with these people is simply not worth the hassle and misrepresentation and the snotty, rude attitude.   Try another company that specializes in this kind of thing, I don't think these guys aren't worth the stress.  And yes, I reported them to Living Social too.

A very good, all beef hot dog!    Surprisingly good, but a hell of a long wait to get it unless you come early and miss the lunch crowd, and a slightly intimidating ordering process if you are a first timer.  I need to come try other things here, but so far I can vouch for the all beef hot dog.  Oh, and a free piece of salt water taffy at the register for dessert!  (Yas!!)

Stopped here today to get a Southern Style Chicken Sandwich for lunch and as I was sitting at the window waiting for my order the Manager opens the window and says "Do you like iced coffee?", "Why, yes I do" I answer, "Caramel flavor?" she checks?, yes again.  Apparently I was the lucky recipient of an extra iced coffee.  Sweet!  #WINNING!  #YOLO  #SWAGTASTICREVIEW  #ONFLEEK   Oh, and the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich was de-riggen-licious too.  (And since there were no Confederate flags printed on the 'Southern Style' packaging I had no guilt about eating it.  #EXTREMESARCASM)

For Wal-Mart's this one is among my favorites.    I can always find what I need and the stock is always replenished, and the prices are reasonable.  The store is clean, and the staff is all friendly and helpful.    You can also get in, get your stuff and check out in a reasonable time too, which is in STARK contrast to the God awful Wal-Mart that is closest to my house.

This is my gym.  It's expensive as hell, but worth it.  The workout and water facilities are top notch and they have several of everything, so there really isn't any wait, but what REALLY sets Lifetime apart in my book is the locker rooms.   Their locker rooms are fabulous and second to none.  They offer free, clean towels as you walk in and the locker rooms have numerous changing bays (and some private changing cubbies) with polished granite, stainless steel, stained wood surfaces everywhere.  All the lockers have built in locks, that lock with your membership card.  Although I'll add that I am apparently too retarded to understand *exactly* how to make the lock work with my membership card.  They also offer a side lounge with a flat panel tv and leather couches.  There is a separate room with all the toilet stalls, and for reasons I won't spell out here, the door between the locker room area and the toilets is a good thing.    Plus there are generously sized showers with self-serve, wall mounted body soap/shampoo, a wonderful, mentholated steam room, a digital scale and even a swimsuit water spinner.  There is even tanning bed access, if you're into that kind of thing.  I can't speak any more highly of the locker rooms at Lifetime, the only other gym that comes close is Mountainside, but they don't compare when it comes to other gym amenities.

I had to cancel my membership after a sudden loss of income due to a suicide in the family.  I explained my delicate situation to the employee working the front desk (Brandon) and he was extremely sympathetic and kind about the whole thing; offering his condolences, and at no point pressuring me to keep my membership.  Then I went to the aquatic center to also cancel our swim lessons for my daughter and the Aquatics Director, Drew, was understanding and kind about the whole thing as well.  He even offered to let me cancel our swim lessons effective immediately, so that I didn't have to pay for a new month's worth at the next billing cycle, but to allow my daughter to continue taking the classes through the remaining 3 weeks of my membership using the make-up classes that we had on our account.  That was definitely appreciated.   Perhaps someday when my circumstances change I can return as a member again.

I love QT.  All locations, not just this particular one.  Their prices are fair, they are spotless, bright, well stocked and the employees always greet you as you walk in.      Their drink station is amazing,  They always have the best selection of different drinks from coffees (hot and cold), milk shakes, slurpees, smoothies, sodas, herbal and iced teas, you name it.  I love this.  In fact, did you know that the coffee area has a whipped cream dispenser and flavored creamer dispenser?  (Awesome, right?)  Also, they have a great ready to eat food section too.  From wrapped hot sandwiches, tubes of varous meats rolling away in their heated deliciousness and salads and wraps, fresh fruit, pastries and donuts.  The selection is brilliant.  Anyway, this is my favorite convenience store hands down.  I will go out of my way to find a QT, they are so much better than all the others out there.

Delicious, hot, affordable and filling!   Pro Tip:  Opt for the dinner sized bowl and also buy a to go container too.  Then cram as much stuff as you can in your silver bowl before they cook it.  Then fill half of the to go container with rice and pour all your leftovers into the take out container when you are done eating.  Viola!  Ready made lunch for tomorrow.  :)

It's an Arbys.  The food is good, the prices are fair, and the employees are competent and friendly.  What really sticks out at this Arbys is the faded, mid 1980's decor and the over squishy booth cushions that threaten to suck you, butt first, into the lower bowels of the booth's framework!!  For crying out loud, I recently sat at a booth and sank down so low I looked like a 3 year old, barely able to see over the tabletop, and the next booth wasn't any better.  O_0  Fix that crap, STAT!

Mediocre, overpriced food and a terrible wait for two containers of pre-made sushi and a salad, to go.    Oh, and tip jars at the registers.  Tips jars for what exactly?  It's fast food.     On the plus side, if you don't count the well-worn signage, and the old faded décor it is very clean.  I almost forgot, for sheer entertainment purposes, make sure to check out the misspelled sign in the ladies room!  (Sorry guys, you are out of luck on this one!)

Delicious margaritas and stellar customer service on a Thursday night from our waitress.   I had finished my happy hour margarita and sat it down and literally no less than a minute later our waitress had scooped up my empty margarita glass and had replaced it with a fresh one.    Now THAT'S paying attention to your customers!  Color me impressed!!  (And drunk.  Color me drunk too.  I needed a ride home that night.)

I've had an account with Arizona Central Credit Union for years and I love them.  They have excellent customer service and low fees.  The couple of times I've had account issues, one stolen card and one unauthorized debit, they took care of the matter immediately and credited my account for the missing funds.  I used to have another checking account with a different Valley credit union, and they were dismal to deal with and cost me so much in missing money (they let my husband at that time who was NOT on my account, access my account and he took all the money in there each time.)  Anyway, I've never had a single issue with AZCCU.   Another big plus for AZCCU is, like other credit unions, I can make a deposit or withdrawl at any other credit union because they are all linked by something called shared branching.  That is very nice if I need to make a deposit to my account and I am miles away from a AZCCU branch.

I stopped here on Sunday to treat two very special men in my life to a Father's Day dinner, and the service was friendly, prompt and the food was delicious.    I had the chicken fried steak ($13.95) with mashed potatoes and white gravy and I ate all of it.  I never finish everything in one sitting at a restaurant but it was just that good.  My fellow diners had the meatloaf ($12.95) and the another also had the chicken fried steak and neither of them had any complaints either.  We all cleaned our plates.  Dinner for everyone was $51.42, before the tip.  We topped off our visit with slices of pie to go, and later that night my 4 year old and I destroyed my slice of Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  It was stupendous.  Good God, those people at Rock Springs know their pie like nobody's business.  I'm no kitchen novice but I only *wish* I could bake pies that delicious.

Stopped here again a couple of weeks ago on my way back down from Flagstaff.  This is becoming a normal stopping point on the I-17 for me.  It's just far enough away from Flagstaff that it gives you a great opportunity to stretch your legs or get a snack.  Anyway, this time I had my 2 littles; the 9 year old and the 4 year old, and they both wanted slices of the chocolate pie and I wanted a piece of the Jack Daniels Pecan Pie.  We got our pie to go and were back on the I-17 before my boyfriend, whom I'd been following down the mountain, had even realized we'd pulled off the road!  Back at home we had our pie, and it was glorious.  Of course my pie was delicious, no surprise there, that's why I always get it.  But this time I also snuck a taste of the kids chocolate pie...  Full disclosure: I am normally not a fan of chocolate pie.  I think I had one too many crappy chocolate pudding pies as a kid and it put me off of chocolate pie forever.    This chocolate pie on the other hand was amazing: the crust was buttery and flaky, and the chocolate filling was smooth and slightly sweet, but not cloyingly so, with a slightly dark chocolate aftertaste.  The whole pie was garnished with delicately sweetened whipped cream that added to the velvety creaminess of the chocolate filling.    I'm telling you, they knocked this one out of the park!  I'm still not a fan of chocolate pie, but I am a fan of THEIR chocolate pies.  I may be more than a fan....I may become a crazed stalker...

Okay, this is my hometown Mexican food restaurant.  I have eaten this food all my life and I grew up less than a block from the original owners, The Amabisca Family.  That said, it's not gourmet Mexican food, but it's good enough for me.    In fact it's good enough to make me crave it a few times a year when I drive back out to the homestead to check on my parents and the rest of the relatives.  Specifically I crave their shredded beef taco plate with sides of rice and beans.  Oh man, I dunno what it is about their oily, salty, shredded beef tacos with beans and rice, but I love them.  And they also have a very unusual hot sauce that they serve with their chips, that I *swear* has oregano in it (and I like it) but it's definitely an acquired taste.  And another thing they make here that is amazing is their Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  So damn good!  So, this is a decent little place for *Americanized* Mexican food, UNLESS of course you are a bone fide food snob, in which case don't bother because you'll probably just decide you hated it as you pull out of the parking lot, sneering at the little town of Buckeye as you screech away towards the I-10 cursing the Food Gods that somehow misdirected you here in the first place...

We stopped here for lunch with the baby on Saturday.   We were seated immediately and the server got us our drinks and some warm bread and butter right away.  Our server was very friendly (in fact just a little too sugary sweet) and she did her job well.  We ordered from the lunch menu.  I got the Miso Salmon and my husband ordered the cheese pizza.  Our food was out within 15 minutes and mine was delicious, but my husband said his pizza was just so-so and about the same quality as a cheese pizza from Sam's Club.  (OUCH!)  Anyway, our bill for two passion fruit iced teas, a lunch pizza, a lunch salmon and a slice of the pina colada cheesecake (to go) was $42, before gratuity.  The baby just ate off of my plate because she is too little for her own plate still.  I ate the pina colada cheesecake slice later that night and it was just okay.  It may just be me, but I think that their more exotic cheesecake flavors aren't nearly as good as the plain old vanilla bean cheesecake.  Maybe it's because the other ingredients in the more exotic cheesecake varieties detract from their perfect vanilla cheesecake recipe...?  I dunno what it is, but I've experienced this phenomenon more than once.  Sadly this time I thought it'd be different with the promising pina colada flavor, but it just didn't deliver.  It didn't taste very tropical, or very cheese-cakey.  I'll just remind myself to order the plain vanilla cheesecake next time and stop being drawn in by the tempting siren song of the exotic cheesecake flavors.

I went here over the weekend with my six year old son and 20 month old daughter.  Apparently my son saw something on one of his cartoons (Regular Show to be specific) that made it cool to visit an art museum, so he requested I take him.  Thank you, Cartoon Network!  I was a tiny bit apprehensive about how my toddler would do, but I packed them up and off we went!  Parking was ample and as we entered we were immediately greeted by a gracious ticket clerk who patiently explained the different exhibits that the children would probably most enjoy: The Firefly room, the Blob and the Miniature Room were the top picks.  He circled them all on the visitor map so we could easily find them.  Our cost for admission was $22 ($15 for me and $7 for my son.  My daughter was free.)  I'd also like to add that at no point did I get the impression from anyone that I wasn't welcome to visit with such wee kids.  I secretly feared I'd get a stern warning that they were to be closely supervised to avoid touching things, kept from crying and disturbing the other patrons, no sippy cups/bottle in the exhibits halls, etc., but I wasn't given any preemptive admonishments or warnings about keeping them controlled and/or silent.  Not that I'm the type to let my kids run free, screaming their heads off, but still, I hate it when someone warns me in advance about watching my kids.    So off we went to explore the museum, and I have to tell you that I am genuinely impressed!  I am embarrassed to admit that I haven't been there since I was a grade school kid on a field trip...  What can I say?  I have been pretty busy for the last 25 years raising kids, holding down a full time job, and just generally surviving.  But mark my words, I DO have culture (and NOT just the kind you treat with antibiotics) yet, sadly, getting to the Phoenix Art Museum had fallen too far down on my list of adult priorities.  Well not any longer my friends.  Not any longer.    Let's start with the exhibits we saw.  First we entered the Great Hall which was full of some really neat modern pieces, including the Firefly exhibit which BLEW my mind and left my toddler speechless; not that she really talks, but still...  At first my six year old was too scared to enter the pitch black firefly exhibit, but I finally grabbed his arm and dragged him in and suddenly he was entranced by the sight and wandered about the room with his arms outstretched exclaiming wildly about how awesome it was.  Let me give you a visitor tip, the Firefly Exhibit is tucked into a corner on the top floor off the Great Hall.  It is very easy to walk right by and it's not well labeled , but if you are near the exhibit with the suspended cube of burned timbers then you are in the right neck of the woods.    Downstairs we saw The Blob, which my son and daughter went nuts for.  I can't explain it except to compare it to the cartoon character 'Annoying Orange'...  It's pretty funny!  After that we darted outside into the grassy courtyard to soak up the sun and give my daughter a chance to get out her wiggles and have a sippy cup of milk.  The courtyard was a nice, open air place for the kids to romp.  It is also attached to a café that is entered from within the museum.    After that we stopped over at the kids hands-on art room, which surprisingly wasn't at all interesting to me and the wall art focused far too strongly on the relation of math principals and modern art but my son and daughter really liked the chance to color and touch stuff.  Then we scooted through the early Masters exhibits (at a muffled run) which *I* really liked and would have spent more time enjoying, but the baby's patience was starting to wear thin, so we quickly hit the Miniature Room which was very cool and highly detailed, and then beat a hasty retreat to the exit.  We got out of there just as the baby was about to have a nap-deprivation meltdown.  (Timing:  When you have a toddler it IS everything!)  In conclusion: The Phoenix Art Museum is a lot bigger than I remember it being back in the late 1970's and the exhibits are varied, beautiful and fascinating.  I highly suggest taking an afternoon and checking it out.  If you have a little one like me, you may want to find a babysitter, or time it after their nap, but make SURE you do check out the Firefly Room.  PS:  Wednesday nights and First Friday's are FREE to visit!  Yay for free

Oh, Lo-Lo's how I love thee...    I catered Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles for a surprise Halloween lunch for my staff this week and it was a huge hit.  I just told them I was catering lunch in, I didn't tell who was bringing the food.  After the food was set up and ready to go I emailed the staff and told them the food was ready and that it was Lo-Lo's.  You should have seen the steady stream of employees that started 'prairie dogging' over their cubicle walls and letting each other know what the big, surprise lunch announcement was!  It was hilarious how fast they scooted their normally slow asses to the conference room to be the first in line for Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles!!  Lo-Lo himself (Larry) came out and he made piping hot, fresh waffles to order as the employees all dined on the best fried chicken in all of Arizona, and some of the most delicious mac and cheese and read beans and rice I've ever tasted.    Ohmidog, their food is so damn good...  I was the office hero for the day and I couldn't have done with without Lo-Lo's.  Thank you, Larry!    You want to be the most popular person in your office?  Cater Lo-Lo's for your staff for lunch.  You will NOT be disappointed in the results.  ;)

I've been to Lo-Lo's (and catered another office luncheon) several times since my first review for them and it's always the same thing when I do patronize them; amazing, flavorful food cooked with love and served by gracious, friendly servers.    The last time I went to their Phoenix location they had a special on an appetizer of fried green tomatoes and my husband and I tried them and were so impressed with them, delicious!  I definitely suggest you order them if they are offering them when you go!

I went here on Saturday with my 2 rug rats, the baby, and the husband.  I hadn't been to Mary Coyle's since I was a kid and it was still in its original location on Thomas Road.   I was please to see they still had the mountain of ice cream that I fondly remembered from my childhood, but at the $75 price tag, there was no way MY kids were gonna get to repeat my same memory.  And while I know it wasn't $75 back then (inflation being what it is, and all) I'm still trying to figure out how my mom and dad, who were perpetually broke, swung the undoubtedly high cost back then...?   Anyway, I digress.  The pink and white decor was cute, but it seemed a tiny bit dingy around the edges in some places.  Example: The tables had very cute, colorful Gerbera daisy arrangements, but the glass vases weren't exactly sparkling clean...  The waitress' pink skirt had stains on it that I immediately noticed...needed washing.  That kind of thing.  Our waitress was very sweet, and quite attentive.  She gave us grownups pink paper menus and the kids got kiddie menus with crayons.  Paper menus normally don't bother me, but these adults menus were a bit wrinkled and I'm of the school of thought that if you are using paper menus you need to toss them out as soon as they show ANY wear.  They need to be crisp and smart looking.  You may save a nickle in printing costs, but it looks cheap overall.  So the food was delicious, I got a half soup and sandwich plate; my potato soup was fabulous (big chucks of perfectly cooked potatoes, green onion, bacon and cheddar cheese) and my Reuben sandwich was quite tasty, although a bit too 'saucey' and messy.  The kids each respectively had a hot dog and macaroni and cheese with a side of Poore Brother's Potato Chips, they ate all of it.  My husband had a French dip sub and ate the whole thing.   To finish our food we ordered the 9 scoop banana split, and the waitress had no issue with our request to substitute a couple of scoops of coffee ice cream in place of the vanilla.   (The boys had their little hearts set on trying the coffee ice cream!)   The ice cream was fabulous.  Just the perfect combination of sweet and creamy, with whipped cream, a cherry, fresh strawberry, pineapple and hot fudge toppings and roasted, chopped nuts (served on the side).  I was very pleased with this late lunch.  I will come back for sure, I do have a couple of small suggestions for the management though.  -Please toss out the paper menus more frequently.  -Do not reuse the disposable, plastic kids cups.  (My 6 year old received one that looked like it'd seen a few different meals and it was creepy.  Maybe it was just scratched up from being slipped inside another cup, maybe, but it looked like it was used.)  -The fluorescent lighting in the ladies room is horrendous.  It makes the ladies appear green and sickly when they stand under it and adjust their make up in the mirror.  This leaves us with an unpleasant feeling that makes you want to get out of the rest room as quick as possible.  Maybe that needs to be softened with an incandescent bulb, or dual vanity lights on either side of the mirror?  -The security camera glaring down at people in the dining room is a bit unsettling.  Is your location really that dangerous that you feel the need for such a conspicuous video camera?  I bet you can conceal that in a corner someplace and make the place seem more inviting overall.  Thanks for a great family lunch!

I brought my six year old son and 20 month old daughter here for a, much needed, sugary pick me up after I took them to the Phoenix Art Museum and we had a great time.  The place was still sporting Christmas décor in their traditional pink and black colors and it was very, very cute.     We had the same server that we had the last time we visited and she was just as sweet and efficient this visit.  We sat on the patio since the weather was so nice and we ordered a glass of lemonade for me, a chocolate milkshake for my son and a small banana sundae for us to share.    The sundae was wonderful and it came with a scoop each of vanilla, strawberry and chocolate ice cream, plus strawberry, pineapple and hot fudge toppings, and all smothered with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  An optional nut topping is served on the side for those with allergies.  Our total damage was about $17, including a tip.    This is a great little place and I love visiting with my kidlets!

We come here often, despite my stark lack of check in's because I suspect their restaurant walls are lead lined, or perhaps T-Mobile's crappy network doesn't reach 19th Avenue and Camelback?    Anyway, we do come here often.  I like their food, I like their prices and I like their service.  The food here is maybe a half a star less than the food at the other Viet place right up the street, but the service is a tad friendlier here and I have never, ever been approached for money by a panhandler in the parking lot at Da Vang, whereas I've never NOT been approached in the parking lot at the other place.    It's a simple as that, good food, great prices, friendly service and no gauntlet of panhandlers to brave in the parking lot.

Do you seek potions (retro game cartridges)?  Is your manna low (need an old system controller)?  Could you use spells to guide you on your journey (walk-throughs of various games)?  Then this is the merchant for you!  This tiny, wee mom & pop game store not only specializes in retro gaming platforms, but the gracious proprietor has achieved Wizard Level 10* in customer service!  You have a choice when you spend your fists full of sweaty, crumbled, nerd dollars.  You can go to the larger game stores where you better know EXACTLY what you want/need because they don't have much time or interest in helping address your questions, OR you can go to the little bitty mom and pop store where the wizard behind the counter will sweetly lead you to the right case of retro gear and she'll make sure that your dumb ass doesn't accidentally buy a SNES game for a NES platform, or a Sega controller for your first generation Playstation.  Oh, and just as a sideline, I noticed the prices here seemed lower too...that's extra manna in your pocket, Link.  Throw some love to this little place, I don't think you'll regret it.  *DISCLAIMER: Wizards don't have levels, actually.

I came here for my husband's office Christmas party and I had a wonderful time!  The Christmas party was held in the Adobe room and as we walked in to the grounds of Rawhide we were greeted by employees dresses in period Western costumes and a roaring fire pit.  There were festive Christmas lights and decorations lining the main street of Rawhide and it was a lovely sight!  We were directed to the location of our event and we entered the old fashioned salon style building to see a huge beautiful tree in the main lobby, and old western antiques and beautiful period art everywhere.  The antiques and theme artwork really lent an old west ambiance to the place.  We were served steaks, bbq chicken, baked potatoes, beans, salad and garlic bread in a pass-thru line and it was extremely efficient, plus the food was outstanding.  You could look into the open kitchen in the back and see the employees cooking the steaks and chicken over an open pit suspended grill.  It was neat to watch.  The dining room servers were all in western costumes and were friendly and efficient at clearing plates.  There were two cash bars set up and the friendly bartenders were serving perfectly mixed cocktails in addition to beer and wine.  This party had a DJ and he did a good job of keeping the party lively and MC'ing the event.  My only complaint was that his mic wasn't turned up quite loud enough for us to hear every speech given buy the managers of my husband's company because we were sitting in the back on the banquet hall.  Aside from that I have no complaints or observations, just that I had an outstanding time!!

This is where I bring my much loved XC70 when she's *really* feeling down.  Lately she's been seriously out of sorts, throwing me lots of side eye, some attitude and codes, more than a couple of check engine codes.  But no worries, the experts at Volvo of Tempe know what her moods mean and what I need to do to soothe her bad attitude.  They will run a check engine code for free and give me a detailed repair estimate and they even gave my girl a complimentary bath and vacuum when I took her in to be pampered!  I can't always afford the dealer service, but when I do spring for it, it's always going to be with Volvo of Tempe.

Love these guys, wonderful, customer service, low rates, reasonable fees.  I see no reason to keep using large, thieving corporate banks when awesome little credit unions like this exist.

I purchased my Volvo wagon here and I was very impressed by the laid back and friendly way I was treated.  At no point were they rude or pushy and the whole process was just pleasant.  In fact, it felt like I was dealing with an old friend through the whole process, they didn't come across as shady or insincere at all.  Very enjoyable experience, and the next time I need a car they will be the first place I contact.  These guys absolutely DESERVE my repeat business!  :)

You've gotta come here and get one of their baguettes.  They are the freshest, softest and most flavorful baguettes from anywhere in the whole Valley.  One of their fresh warm baguettes and a couple of tablespoons of soft, sweet cream butter and you have yourself the best breakfast in the world!  They also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.  It's all amazingly fresh and tasty, but we forewarned before you arrive that they are a cash only operation, so hit up your bank's ATM on the way, or pay the convenience fee to use the freestanding ATM inside of Lee's.

Just took 18 of my co-workers here for lunch.    The place is very cute, the music was appropriate and the food was delicious.  The only complaint is that some of our party didn't get their food until the rest of the party had been served and was halfway done eating, so the kitchen needs to better about timing large orders.     Otherwise it was a pleasant visit.  It cost me about 230.00 to feed 18 people with the lunch special.  Not too bad!  I think we'll be back.  :)

We celebrated a birthday here the other night, and celebrate we did...    The décor at Claim Jumper is big and rustic, but cozy, evocative of a Yukon lumber mill.  Given the name, that can't be a surprise, right?    The food portions are generously sized to match.  Think food for lumberjacks; delicious, hearty, meaty food for lumberjacks.    Do you have a lumber-sexual in your life?  Bring him here.  Feed him man sized hunks of meat and mighty forkfuls of mashed potatoes, all washed down with beer.    He'll thank you later.    After the kids are in bed.

Always a great burger.  They are hot, juicy and delicious.    They lost a star for having someone yelling order numbers over the intercom all lunch hour.  I've been here several times and never seen them do that.  It was annoyingly loud and distracting.  Oh well, the food is still fabulous.

I had a very nice experience at my first Suns game recently.  Sadly I have lived in Phoenix since 1975, you'd think I'd have been to a game sooner than 2013.  I am dissapoint too...    The action was face paced, the facility was clean and welcoming and the employees we encountered were all very friendly and accomodating.  The game and cheerleaders were very entertaining and overall I had a very nice time!    My only complaint was the high prices and long wait for drinks in the mezzanine level bar.   In fact the waitress forgot my drink, and I had to walk up to the bar and place the order myself.  (Oh well, that truly is a first world problem!)  PS:  Anyone else ever notice the the word SUNS on the basketball court floor is an ambigram and can be read from either side of the court?  Me neither!  You're welcome.

Beautiful hotel.  I got a 'DealChicken' deal for a night here and was super excited to check it out.  I am a bit of a hotel freak.  I love checking out new hotels.  I go for the boutique, antique and eclectic hotels, and I really know my way around a hotel room. (Innuendo fully intended for laughs.)  I really, really wanted to like the Valley Ho and happily, I wasn't disappointed.  Some of the highlights:  Awesome mid-century modern decor, with an unexpected pops of color here and there.  It's almost as if you expect to see a reincarnated member of the Rat Pack to come strutting over from the lounge with a Highball in his hand.    Beautiful bathrooms with nice finishing touches.  The whole bathroom is walled in with frosted glass walls and a sliding door.  The vanity and sink area was marble with a porcelain bowl sink and featured higher end toiletries, a hair dryer and generous supply of soft fluffy towels.  The toilet was hidden in its own water closet with a sliding door.  The tiled shower had a rain shower head, and the extra large, Kohler soaker tub had a blue mood light placed seductively above it and a handily placed white cotton bathrobe within arms reach.  Very inviting.  The beds were super soft Sealy mattresses and were smartly made with crisp cotton sheets and soft, white down duvets.  The only think I didn't like with the beds was the ill fitting blue suede platforms for the box springs. The platforms weren't spaced tightly enough to the box springs to keep from showing the ugly unfinished part of the platforms.  A very minor detail.  Another thing I didn't care for was the blinding fluorescent light bulb in the bedside lamp.  It was a terrawatt in strength, I'm sure...  (Softer bulb, please?)  The end of the room featured a double, sliding glass patio door and wall to wall black out curtains with sheer drapes that could both be swept back, creating huge passway between the room and the spacious private patio; which had a dual, padded lounge chair and a mid-sized patio table and an view of the well kept patio greenery and fence (first floor room).  The rest of the room was spacious and the only small drawbacks on the look of the room is that the mid sized, flat panel television set is placed on a large counter top in front of a HUGE expanse of stark, white block wall.  It makes the television look lonely and tiny against that huge white wall.  Maybe add some inexpensive, colorful art work on that back wall to jazz it up some?  The minibar is something else and had a lovely stock of hard alcohol, mixers, sodas, snacks and even some Valley Ho themed playing cards and a corkscrew, in case you forgot your own.  The prices seemed reasonable to me, but then I got raped for a $15 bottle of water (that's right $15) at some fancy pants hotel right off the Champs-Élysées in Paris.  (My butt STILL hurts over that.)     There was also a mini, pod style coffee maker and real half and half creamers in the fridge.  NICE TOUCH...extra star! (But please provide a few more creamers, 4 creamers is not quite enough...)  We ate our dinner at Cafe ZuZu and to be honest, I was underwhelmed about the food.  It was nice, but not worth what they were asking for it.  If it hadn't been for the strong pour on my mojito cocktail (and the 2 free cocktails coupon upon check-in) I would have been a LOT more disappointed in that dinner.  But I do have to say that we were given a complimentary dessert...some kind of a peanut butter mouse frosted in a velvety chocolate ganache and garnished with gold leaf, and it was simply delectable.  No other words to describe it.  We visited the pool after dinner.  It was very nice and completely deserted.  In fact I checked to make sure we weren't entering at the wrong hours since we were all alone, but no, it seems all the drunken pool party types were still out in Scottsdale bars getting hammer faced so they could REALLY party later that night.  We had it all to ourselves!  :)  My ONLY complaint was that the hot tub, which I was so looking forward to, was *just* lukewarm.  Bummer!  We consoled ourselves with a hot bubble bath for two, so the evening still ended well...  ;)  After we tucked in for the night I never heard a peep from the other guests, the walls are sound proof and I loved that.  Also, we didn't have some squeaky voiced house keeper banging on our door at the crack of 8:30 the next morning (I was hung over, okay??) saying "Housekeeping!  I clean your room?"  That is my biggest hotel-related pet peeve.  The front desk checked us out efficiently and pleasantly the next morning.  We misplaced our valet ticket but it was no problem, they called valet and asked for our car to be brought up anyway.  The valet attendants were very friendly and had our car ready to go within 3 minutes.    We pulled away and I was just a little sad...  It was such a nice stay I was sad it was already over.   We have to go back again soon!

I had to solve the problem of where to host my daughter's high school graduation party last May.  My house is too small to comfortably host the whole family for a party, and I definitely didn't want to clean it up so that I wouldn't feel like all my dirt was on display for the family either. (I've done that before and a pre-party cleaning frenzy is just too much stress for me.  I demand a spotless house when I know company is coming.)    My solution?  I scheduled the party for a Sunday afternoon and I rented a one bedroom (2 queen bed) casita at the Pointe Hilton for Saturday and Sunday night!  My husband, my two littlest kids and I checked in on Saturday to a beautifully clean and spacious casita with a full living room, dining area, half bath and a mini-kitchen downstairs and a bedroom, bathroom and patio upstairs.  The casita came with a covered carport too.  Now all we had to do was throw up some decorations, pick up the cake from Costco and catered party trays the next morning from the deli and relax.  Done and Done.  We spent Saturday just relaxing and swimming with our littlest kids.  Come Sunday we grabbed the food, tidied up our bedroom area and waited for the guests.  The party was a HUGE success and my daughter was able to spend the day visiting with her guests and they all got to go enjoy the water park attached to the resort.  The guests spent the day lounging around the casita, hanging out on the casita patio (seats 6 or more) and swimming. That evening I let my daughter stay the last night in the casita while my husband and I took our little kids home.    It was one of my best parties ever and I am so grateful to the Pointe Hilton for making it possible with such a beautiful and user friendly casita, and convenient (and fun) amenities like the water park and resort pools.

I come here all the time.    It is a model match to the old, defunct Fry's Food and Drug on Litchfield Park Road in Goodyear that I used to shop in with my mom back when I was in high school in the late 80's.  This is the last of the Fry's Food and Drug (that I am aware of) that still has this old school layout, and for some nostalgic reason I always gravitate towards coming here.  I know where each and everything is and what aisle it's in (all the aisles are even the same) and it's a Fry's so I already know the prices are fair.  Anyway, childhood nostalgia may not be their biggest selling point to their other customers, but at least for me it's a nice little step back to 25 years ago.  Now I have never had a problem with the lines at the registers being that bad or by not being able to get help when I needed it, so I can't vouch for that.  Is this Fry's newer and fancy?  Nope.  But you know what, it's for that EXACT reason that I like it so much.  With so much changing and modernization happening so fast all around us I think it's nice to stop the clock and take a step back and just revisit our old haunts, and this store does just that for me.

Had my wedding here in 2010.  We got engaged in December and thought we'd do a May wedding and looked at a few places, but as soon as we saw Ashley Manor I wanted to hold it there.  It was beautiful.  When I expressed my interest to the coordinator at Ashley Manor she told me that I could get a major discount if I opted to do our wedding earlier than the wedding 'season' at the end of the Spring, like we'd originally planned.  The discount was considerable if we could do the wedding on certain weekday dates in February and we were game, so our late May wedding suddenly became our mid-February wedding.  As you can imagine we were rushing to get things done!  Thank God for the Ashley Manor coordinators, they made it 100x easier than I could have ever imagined!  We opted for an all-inclusive package which (in 2010) was almost $10,000, again we got a nice discount because we chose a less popular time.  The package included facility rental, food and drink for 50 people (LUX Catering: three appetizers,  two entrees, one salad, one vegetable, one starch), basic bar service and a bartender, a DJ and Master of Ceremonies for 5 hours, a cake for 50 (Nancy Rae Cakes), ALL of the flowers for the whole event, a security guard, and a choice of linen colors for the tables and a coordinator to make sure the whole thing went smoothly.  The good things  -The place is very, very pretty, there are a couple of places here and there that could use some minor repairs and updating, but really, this place is pretty.    -Our flowers were amazing!  We ordered blue roses and white Easter lilies.  The effect was gorgeous, and they didn't spray paint the roses, but had them water dyed the exact same color of bright blue that I wanted.  I'm a florist's daughter, and I was impressed.  -The cake was beautiful and DELICIOUS.  We ordered a banana cake with strawberry filling and white buttercream icing, piped in a lacy-white spiderweb overlay.  Not only did Nancy Rae not bat an eye when we told her we wanted a 'Corpse Bride' themed cake, she went above and beyond in delivering one!  We had collectors edition Corpse Bride figurines for our cake toppers and the effect was beautiful, creepy and playful.   -They had no issues with us doing a candy buffet and happily provided a candy table in the castle turret opposite the cake turret.  We did an assortment of purple, black, blue and green candies and custom message fortune cookies in multi-tiered apothecary jars with blue butterflies and purple and blue dragonflies clinging to the sides, all with monogrammed, white Chinese take out boxes.  It was spectacular.  -Additionally, Ashley Manor's DJ was great.  Our ceremony ending song was New Order's-Ceremony and he timed the music to our exit perfectly, and he was actually excited when we told him that our 'Mr. & Mrs. Introduction' song should be the energetic trumpet opening to Oingo Boingo's-Dead Man's Party.  Our first dance was to Blue October's-Calling You and he nailed it.  He only failed us once by using some techno re-mix of Echo & The Bunnymen's-Lips Like Sugar for the cake cutting ceremony, not the original recording.  -The LUX Catering food was quite good and we enjoyed everything, and our bartender was friendly and accommodating.  (We brought in our own cases of wine).  The not so great things  -The coordinators were all very friendly, but they weren't consistent.  We worked with at least 3 different coordinators over the span of about 10 weeks and it was a bit confusing not knowing who was in charge of our file that particular day and having to reexplain the last discussion with the other coordinator to them each time we had a conversation.  The one MAJOR glitch was that we believed that one of the coordinators had offered us two additional appetizers, but the next coordinator would not honor it and claimed it wasn't documented, so we had to pay out of pocket in the last couple of weeks to cover the two extra appetizers.    -We hardly got any prep time before the wedding for photos because we were coming in on the heels of another wedding, because of that we only got a few photographs of the wedding party.  That made me very sad.  -Finally, at the end of the event almost NOBODY was still there from Ashley Manor staff for me to ask if there was anyone to help us clean up and pack our stuff.   I didn't know if we were supposed to leave our stuff and get it the next day, or what.  We weren't really told what to expect, and so there I was at midnight, in my gown, trying to pack up my stuff and get ready to leave.  Finally someone told us we could get it in the morning if we got there by 10 AM.  When we got there the next day, our stuff was packed up for us and ready to go, but sadly one of my apothecary jars from my candy buffet had been broken and the cake topper that we were supposed to freeze for our one year anniversary had been crammed into a too-small cake box and smooshed.   :(  Pics uploaded.

This place is the best!   I used Oasis Ortho for my daughter, Breanna's, braces and it was nothing but a positive experience for the 4+ years that her treatment took.  They did her initial exam and told me what all that she needed to have done, and she needed A LOT of work...her teeth were a mess.  Dr. Day sat down with me and explained everything.  He provided me with a written work up and copies of her x-rays.  I'm the kind of person who gets nervous when I think something is gonna be too expensive for my modest income, but he was really accommodating and worked with me on affordable (interest free) monthly payments for my portion of the balance after my dental insurance benefits covered half of it.  I'm not sure what braces normally cost, but if I remember right, we paid about $4200 total for her braces, that amount includes what my insurance covered too.  After my portion was paid in full they never, ever came back to me with some 'mystery expense' and asked me to pay another dime.  When I signed the treatment agreement with them they told me that my out of pocket portion for the braces was $2100 and they were 100% true to their word on that, despite the fact that my daughter's teeth were stubborn and needed a longer treatment plan to get aligned correctly.  I really appreciated them sticking to their word on that.  They day that we started the treatment and she got her braces they gave her a gift baggie with some dental goodies and a brand new, super nice electric toothbrush!  (And not a cheap $6 Spin Brush either, but like a $100 rechargeable Sonic toothbrush!!  I was very impressed.)  The front office staff was always friendly, polite and very flexible about scheduling her appointments when it worked best for my work and her school schedule.  And they always gave me a courtesy call and email confirmation to remind me of the next appointment date and time; they went above and beyond in all aspects.   The appointments always happened on time, or even early when we occasionally showed up early and they took her right in.  The front lobby was always spotless, comfortable and inviting and had a fun play area for the younger siblings, with cartoons, a wall mounted video game terminal and a couple of wall mounted Rube Goldberg-like toys interactive toys.   The patients always get a fruit flavored tropical slushy with a fun, tropical umbrella after their adjustments.  (Seriously...they have a slushy machine in the back!)  And a couple of times they even sent another slushy out for her little brother when they gave one to my daughter as she was leaving.  How sweet is that?   Dr. Day is very nice and the technicians we're "cool", as my teenage daughter calls them.  They do a GREAT job there.  They always listened to her feedback on how her teeth were feeling and they let her pick the color of her rubber adjustment bands, so she she could coordinate them with her outfit: pink and black, green and purple, orange and blue; you get the idea...   The technicians were also very cool when it came to fixing broken brackets and not charging us for it, which was very helpful since I think my daughter probably broke a dozen over the course of her treatment.  And as if all of this wasn't enough, a few weeks ago on the day that my daughter came for her very last appointment they gave her a farewell gift that included a bottle of sparkling apple cider, balloons, and a bag of goodies.  She felt so special.  :)    Dr. Day is running a great place here, with outstanding customer service and solid, respectable business practices.  I would suggest them to ANYONE needing braces and when I need braces for my 5 year old son, I'll definitely be back!  :)

I live way on the other side of the Valley so I stayed here the night of a big concert at the concert pavilion a few miles down the road.    My boyfriend and I were very impressed with the cleanliness and amenities of our one bedroom suite.  The bed was extremely cozy, the little kitchen was good for making coffee and heating up some pizza, the bathroom was well stocked and spotless, the living room was comfortable and inviting and we didn't hear and peep from the rooms around us or from the hallway.  Additionally the free hot breakfast was generous and delicious and a good end to a pleasant stay.  We'd definitely stay here again any time!

No, no, no.  Firstly, the facility is beautiful and everyone I encountered was friendly, if a little too overbearing. (I swear, our waiter was at our table every 3-5 minutes, interrupting our conversation to check on us and ask a question.  Enough with the check-ins already, give us some time to dine uninterrupted!)  Secondly, I sat down and my menu is sticky and wet and that set the tone for a less than stellar experience.  What I take away when I encounter a sticky, wet menu is that at some recent point someone wiped it down with a wet towel but they didn't get it fully clean. or dry, so they did a crap job overall; and I'm about to dine here. Yay.  Lastly, the food came and I was horribly disappointed.  I ordered the Lobster Alfredo with Shrimp and a 5" Petite Filet.   That's a lot of high end items on my fettuccini for $18.99 so I expected a pretty decent lunch.  Sadly it wasn't good at all.  The pasta wasn't hot and wasn't cold, it was...tepid?  The presence of lobster was non-existent in the weak flavored pasta sauce.  (Perhaps they waived a piece of lobster over the sauce as it was cooking? That's the only possible explanation.) The shrimp were on the ragged edge of being undercooked, too soft to the touch and still lightly translucent in places, a telltale sign of being underdone.  And finally, one half of my petite filet was nothing but sinewy tendons, leaving me all of 2.5" of meat for my lunch; that annoyed me because I'm a girl that likes her meat.  (TWSS!)   My 9 year old son ordered the kid's mac and cheese for $4.99 from the kid's menu and received...wait for it...a bowl of lukewarm Kraft mac and cheese and nothing more.  Not a small side of fruit, or fries, or anything else to lessen the insult that I just dropped $5 on a small bowl of mac and cheese that would cost me less than fifty cents to buy at the store and get enough to serve the whole family.  Ah, but I forget that I am paying for the ambience of this place: sticky menus, and incessant interruptions, and all!!  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries for $3.99 for my 4 year old daughter and her food was the only thing that was good about the whole dining experience!  And don't even get me started on the price of the games at this place.  The word exorbitant comes to mind.  Nah, my experience here was no good.  My dining partner's experience was no better, having ordered a Chinese Salad that came generously mixed with finely diced kale, when she despises kale and it wasn't listed as an ingredient in the salad on the menu.  She spoke to a manager and got her horrid salad removed from her bill.  I just sucked it up and paid my bill in full and felt queasy all day long after eating one of those undercooked shrimp.  :/

I love this restaurant, I come here often for work events and for lunch: their service is excellent and friendly, the food is delicious and the price is always right.  This place is as good, or better, than the other well known Teppan place over by Chandler Fashion Square Mall.  This last May, I needed a place for my daughter's high school graduation dinner for the whole extended family at 4 PM.  Unfortunately, the 4 PM time was not-negotiable since my daughter had to be at her high school and ready to walk in the ceremony at 6:15 sharp.  When I explained my quandary to the restaurant, not only did they offer to open a half hour early just for our dinner party, but they were accommodating in every other way and the service and food was stellar.  My dinner guests all raved about how good their food was afterwards.    Thank you, Kobe!

I went to this HUGE Goodwill on Grand Avenue this weekend.  It was raining all day and I was bored.  Since one of my favorite things to do, on the cheap, is to rummage though the second hand stores for interesting items and other cool buys, we dressed the baby, packed the diaper bag, and off we went to check out some crap that used to be owned by other people!!  Firstly let me say that this is like Goodwillzilla.  It's huge!  I heard it used to be a former Kmart location so that makes sense for the size of the building.    Sadly though, it's not exactly bursting at the seams with quality stuff.  This one is pretty well picked over and I saw very, very little that interested me.  Although I did find a nice (almost new) baby doll for my baby girl, and black skirt for myself.    I will also mention that I did accidentally go on a '50% off everything' weekend and that alone may have made it seem more picked over than normal...I'm not sure but the place seemed pretty cleaned out and the remaining stuff was more junky than used.  The employees I encountered were all friendly enough.    I will also mention that this Goodwill had an bigger than normal selection of clothes so, by logical deduction, it probably would be a pretty good stop to make on a dirt cheap clothing rummage day.

I wanted to move to Agritopia when my ex and I were looking for a big old house in east Gilbert.  I urged him to consider Agritopia.  I extolled the virtues of the charming neighborhoods, tree lined streets, real front porches, alley accessed garages, the centrally located elementary school for our son, the availability of fresh produce raised within the subdivision, and I went on and on but he wasn't having it.  I think he secretly suspected that I was trying to indoctrinate him into some new fangled 21st century commune or something.    Now I realize exactly what I did wrong.  I didn't force him to come get a meal at Joe's Farm Grill, which just happens to be within a stone's throw to Agritopia and also uses Agritopia's produce garden.  (Or maybe it's Joe's Farm Grill garden and Agritopia uses it?  I dunno, but I do know the two are somehow linked.)    If I had only dragged him into Joe's Farm Grill I could have sealed the deal, I'm sure of it.  Joe's is a really neat little place, surrounded by towering Tamarack trees that have been there forever.  The structure was originally the late 1950's to early 1960's ranch style family home (and former farm) of the same family that now owns Joe's.  Also the family has two other top-notch restaurants, Joe's Real BBQ and Liberty Grill.  The house has since been professionally and radically retrofitted into be a sleek, yet still somehow retro, restaurant, with bathrooms that are so fun and funky that you just have to go there and see for yourself what I mean.  (Trust me.)  The restaurant still retains the old front room of the original house, including the fire place, and it is now a dining room.  It's not hard at all to imagine Joe's family settled around their Christmas tree in their pajamas in the mid-1960's opening presents, completely oblivious to the fact that someday their front room would be a seating area for one of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley.  Yep, I said it: One of the best places to eat in the whole damn Valley; that is NO exaggeration.  The food here is amazing.  It's wildly flavorful, perfectly cooked, and deliciously paired with different sides and it's all reasonably priced to boot.  They know what they do here, and they do it perfectly.  My personal favorite here is the seared Ahi Tuna sandwich with a Wasabi dressing.  I can't even describe how good it is.  It's just a flat out flavor bomb.  (Tip: I will reiterate that the tuna is seared, so if you get it and are expecting a fully cooked tuna steak you will be confused and perhaps even disappointed; don't be, just eat it and savor the deliciousness of a perfectly seared tuna steak on a toasted bun with a wonderful Wasabi dressing and a zesty Asian slaw.)  It is my favorite sandwich from anywhere, ever.  I have also tasted their pizzas, burgers, hot dogs, shakes (come topped with a green cherry!) and French fries and all have been outstanding.  I really cannot find a single criticism for this place.  Oh wait, I just thought of one criticism; that there isn't a Joe's Farm Grill closer to my home, since my ex refused to let us buy a house there.   *pout*

I came here with my husband to get a new battery for our cordless drill and a saw blade that'd work for MDF paneling.  I was impressed with the cleanliness of the store and the overall helpfulness and cheerful attitude of the employees.  It was a big step up from the grubby, grimy home improvement place we normally use down on Thomas Road in east Phoenix.

SO disappointed.  My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:  We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.    What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!  So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade?   *raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!  So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)  The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.      I'll wait for you to come back...  *drumming fingers*  Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...  Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, "That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good."  So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*   Go on, I'll wait.  Again.  *taps foot*  Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?  Back to the review.  Again.    The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like "they ordered the wrong tomatoes", put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.  So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.  Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.  Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless.  The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say "Oh, I'm sorry."  Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?  Worthless.  In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.  I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much.

This is your basic public pool, the facilities are bare bones and the amenities non-existent.  No lockers, limited seating and very little shade in the heat of late afternoon.  There is a snack machine and a soda machine in the main building, but that's about it.  if you are coming to watch your child swim, I'd recommend bringing our own folding chair and a wide brimmed hat in case you can't find a shady spot.     That's the bad part, the good part is that their summer swim lessons are amazingly cheap at just $15 for 8 lessons in a two week, M-TH span, and you can take the swimming class blocks back-to-back if needed.  Our swim instructor was Harrison and our little daughter just adored him, we took two sets of swimming classes with him and he was patient with our wiggly three year old through the whole process.    The classes were limited in size to about 4 or 6 kids each.  Depending on the class level, the instructors worked with them on water comfort, dunking their heads, kicking their legs and using their arms, treading water and so forth.  They gradually worked their way up to jumping off of the diving board and swimming to the edge of the pool as the instructors helped them.  Finally, at the last class the instructors all gave each of their students a Popsicle and a small certificate.  If you are looking for budget friendly swimming classes next summer try the Madison Pool classes, you can find them through the City of Phoenix-Parks and Recreation website.

I came here a few weeks ago with my family to grab burgers and some fries for a quick dinner.  We used the drive thru and I ordered the  1/2 lb Lucky Burger with a side of green chilies and Swiss cheese.    It was well cooked, juicy and hot, but I didn't realize it would be served with so much mustard. Next time I'll just ask for no mustard as I think the mustard kinda overpowered the over flavors.  The green chilies and the Swiss cheese were wonderful options though.  (I have a soft spot for any burger place that offers either of those two as toppings.)     I also ordered some French fries with my burger and they were the perfectly cut, thick type of French fry that you think of when you get fries at a smaller burger establishment, not the skinny, homogenous looking creations you'll find at the large chain places.    Overall this was a good visit and I'll definitely be returning.

Sadly this Walmart is closest to my house, but it is a complete and utter craphole.  The employees are always very nice, but the parking lot is a battleground swarming with migrant workers, scattered trash and random bums coming up to you asking for money, the carts are a joke and I challenge you to find one that has even 3 non-wonky wheels, the store is a friggen mess and checking out???  Oh, dear sweet Jesus, I hope you have an hour to kill because that's how long it'll take you.  I've never seen more than 4 lines open at once, no matter how long the lines were.  Pathetic!  And no matter what, do not, I repeat DO NOT attempt to shop here on the 1st or the 15th of the month.  Just gonna have to trust me on that one...

Looking through the photos that were uploaded for this particular Crapmart you can't help but notice that some woman uploaded a photo of herself wearing gaudy, brightly colored make-up that looked like it'd been applied with a trowel.  And looking at her Yelp account you'll notice that she doesn't actually write reviews, she just uploads photos of herself in various ghetto poses to random businesses.    Have you ever noticed that on the side of all photographs Yelp always asks if the photo is: Very Helpful Helpful Not Helpful   Yeah, I looked at this photograph and it suddenly occured to me that it was actually VERY helpful in describing this particular WalMart.  In fact it should probably be THE storefront photo.  So I clicked VERY helpful, and that's when I noticed that at least 2 other people also thought the same thing and had voted that photograph very helpful.     There you go folks.  That photo says it all.

This is a nice store.  It is the smaller American test venture of the British grocery giant Tesco, who I believe is the UK equivalent of Kroger.  I routinely stop by here after work to pick up a few things before I head home to make dinner and the store is always clean, well stocked and everything is reasonably priced.  The employees I have met have all been very friendly and helpful.  Their house brand is quite high quality and I usually prefer them in both taste and pricing.  Also there are some harder to find items in their import section, which is nice if you occasionally indulge in dishes from overseas, particularly from the UK.  Where else in the Valley can you quickly find clotted cream, spotted dick (*giggle*) and Wheatabix cereal?  Of course the prices for the import items are slightly more than the regular domestic items, but that's to be expected.  They also have a reduced price, fresh food section which I really like because it's usually chock full of ready to eat, but on the verge of expiring, items that are both tasty and affordable.  Also, they sometimes distribute samples of the bakery items from the in-store bakery in the back.  I've noticed their baked goods are quite delicious.  Additionally, they have an admirable selection of import cheeses, cured meats, wines, fresh made hummus, salsas, olives, etc..  I think the perfect Summer dinner is a tray of sliced meats, cheeses, a fresh baguette, some buttery spread, olives, heirloom tomatoes, grapes, roasted nuts and maybe some fig jam.  Delicious and easy thanks to Fresh & Easy.  They send out a weekly mailer that always has a coupon of differing value on your overall purchase price, not just on an individual item.  I really like the $5 off of $25 coupons, but more often than not they send out the $3 off of $30 coupon, not a smoking deal, but if you are coming here anyway that week it pays to have the coupon with you and pocket the $3 savings, right??  My only complaint is about their convoluted, hot ass mess of a shopper's reward card program.  From what I can tell, it's more worthless than tits on a boar hog.  For that alone I am subtracting a point.  It has some bizarre equation of points accumulated with certain purchases.  (But not all purchases...?  I'm actually not sure, it's THAT confusing)  Those points are somehow linked back to some coupons you've *maybe* earned somewhere, which I have never seen offered nor have I been able to generate *any* point-of-sale reduction in price either, and I shop here quite frequently...  It doesn't make any sense, I suspect it's simply a marketing ploy to track our spending habits with the constantly moving target of the tantalizing promise of potential savings, someday...  I MUCH prefer shoppers rewards cards that give you an instant discount (on a artificially inflated price, naturally) or even better, NO rewards cards at all, just plain, old low prices.  Now THAT'S a novel concept.  ;)    Anyway, aside from the stupid shoppers card, all in all, because of its manageable size and fresh selection, this is a good store for a quick trip in and out.  If I need a huge cart full of groceries, this isn't the best store since their overall selection is smaller than say a Fry's, but still for a few must-have dinner or lunch items this is a great option.  And yes, aside from some kinks when they first opened with regards to rotating stock they really are Fresh & Easy.

Oh, Fresh and Easy I will be so sad if you shut down.  :(  I do love you and I love the ease that you offer me after a long day at work.  I can quickly run in, get my milk, a loaf of fresh French bread, some quick produce for tomorrow's lunch bag, and sometimes I'll even get a pre-prepared, preservative free entrée for dinner.  You make it quick and painless and I don't have to walk the length of 3 football fields from one end of the store to the other to hit the dairy, produce, baked goods and meat section.    Another thing I love about you is that you don't clutter up the aesthetics of the store, or add another hassle to my shopping experience by cleverly stationing racks of impulse buys at the check out prompting my son to beg for various sugary delights.    And the final thing I will miss is your mark down area.  While I have found that some items are still priced too high to be a real deal, the only place you lose a star, I've still scored amazing deals on fresh seafood, steaks, bakery items and so forth.  I will certainly miss that too.    Tesco, please reconsider shutting down these stores, there has to be a way to make this business model work.  I'm not sure what that missing secret to your business success is, but I certainly feel that Fresh and Easy is a pleasant enough shopping experience that there has to be some way to turn other shoppers onto it too.

I've been here twice.  Once late at night when I was pregnant and very sick with the flu and dehydrated.  And last night for a throbbing backache.    Anyway, both times it was a good experience.  From the front desk to the back of the office they were great;  The front desk asked for minimal paperwork to be filled out, they got me back immediately, everyone was really friendly and showed genuine concern, and they were all very efficient through the whole process.  I was in and out of there in less than an hour BOTH times.    The cost isn't bad either.  I paid $110 for an exam, a urine test and a script for antibiotics last night.  That wasn't too bad at all.  The first time I went they even called me on my cell a couple of days later to check on me and see if I was feeling better.  I thought that was really nice of them.  While the place is a 'tad' small, it is very clean.  It isn't brand spanking new, but it is well cared for and really not all that old.  I am impressed.  I will definitely be back a third time.  This beats all the other urgent care facilities I've ever had the unfortunate circumstance to use.  This one is a gem.  :)

This is the place to come for a super laid back date night. This is also the place to come for a relaxed and casual family dinner. And this is also the place to come for a girls/guys night out. Additionally it is also a good place for ranchers/farmers/construction workers/bikers to have a cold beer.  You get the drift.    This place is just casual, laid back and fun.  The food is good.  The drinks are good.  The music is good.  There are even fire pits scattered all around and you can buy the stuff to make S'mores.  It's just the perfect place to relax, and eat BBQ with your fingers and enjoy an adult beverage and let the littles run around and play and dance.  (Maybe watch them around the fire pits if they are *really* little.)  Go, go tonight.

We went here last night to pick up some Pho ingredients and I was impressed with the experience.  The prices were extremely reasonable and the employees are very friendly.  They have all the departments you'd expect in a standard grocery store: bakery, produce, fresh meat and seafood, a large live seafood area too, frozen foods, dairy, and dry goods and home sundries.  They also have a small, cafe with various Chinese take away options (you can also eat in), and an admirable selection of sake, import beers and wines.     Now while they have all the standard grocery store departments, this one is different in that they don't really carry any of the tried and true brands that Americans are so familiar with like Kraft, General Mills, etc..  Here you are faced with a dizzying array of imported, ready to eat items that run the gamut from extremely poorly labeled 'mystery items' to easily identifiable foods in bilingual packaging.  It's nice that everything is so reasonably priced here that you can easily afford to be adventurous and try out some different foods.   The only real drawbacks that I noticed in the store are that the aisle signage is all in Chinese, which isn't a problem if you happen to speak it, but makes it very tedious if you only want to find a few things.  In that case, you are pretty much forced to walk up and down each aisle in search of the items you need.  I guess doing that makes it more of an adventure, but I'm guessing it could be annoying if you are really pressed for time.  The store also seemed a bit cluttered and a bit dingy around the edges, but to be fair, it looks like every other Asian grocery store I've ever seen.  The employees we encountered were all very friendly and they seemed to go out of their way to smile at us and coo at our baby daughter.  At no point did I feel like the lone White girl who was way out of her element.  In the past I have ventured into certain ethnic establishments where I can just feel the proprietor and other shopper's eyes on me as they wonder what the hell I was thinking coming in there, which definitely is not a good feeling.  *In fact, it makes you feel about as welcomed as a turd in a punch bowl.      *Interestingly, that's the second time I've used that phrase on Yelp this week.  I'll let you fellow Yelpers wonder exactly where, what (and who) I was referring to in my last usage of that term...  ;-)

I ran in here to get some jasmine rice, beef Pho seasoning and a refill of Jubes Nata De Coco yesterday.  I was disappointed to discover that they only had coconut flavored Jubes, no mango or strawberry ones but that's okay, my toddler devoured them within minutes anyway.  They're DELICIOUS and so fun to eat!!  The store was more crowded than I had ever seen which is great for them.  Also my cashier was very friendly, and despite how crowded the store was, there was zero wait to check out.  The total damage for my stuff was about $16, which wasn't too bad for the size bag of jasmine rice that I got.    There was a vendor selling Chinese pancakes for (I think) 75 cents each, right at the front of the store, and I've never had one so I would have been curious to try one, but I was too pressed for time to wait and only noticed it as I was leaving.   Maybe I'll get a chance to try it next time!  PS:  And I finally noticed the signs over the store aisles are printed in English on one side and Chinese on the other side.  I definitely didn't notice that in my last review... (Doh!)

I came here for lunch the other day and I liked it.  I didnt think the food was as zippy and flavorful as it could've been, but it all seemed perfectly fresh.    (And yeah, in case you wondered, my yardstick for a freshnes assesment on a sushi joint is if I had to spend that night curled up in the fetal position on my bathroom floor, white as sheet and drained of all color, weakly clutching a wastebasket and praying for the sweet, blessed release of death.  And the good news is that DEFINITELY didn't happen.)  The food was cheap and I really appreciated that part of it as it's getting harder and harder to afford work lunches that consist of something more than a PB&J at my desk.  I think the most expensive item on the rotating sushi belt was about $3 a plate.    The service was friendly and prompt and I have no complaints there.  The only suggestion I'd make is to make sure to have your doors unlocked on the second that you advertise that you are open for business.  I walked up and tried the door at almost 5 minutes past 11:00 and it was still locked and I had to stand there like a fool waiting for someone to come and unlock it and let me in for lunch.  Overall not a big issue, just a minor observation.  Anyway, this was a unique experience for a very small outlay of money, and for me that is a recipe for a return visit!  ;-)

I held my company Christmas party here over the weekend and it was a wonderful experience.    From the moment I requested information on holiday parties back in September and was responded to immediately by the Sales Manager, Rebecca; to the moment I walked in for the actual party and was escorted to our private event room the whole experience was efficient, friendly and professional.  Our party went smoothly, the food was delicious, the cocktails (with the exception of the mojito, which seemed to be mixed in an 'unusual' way) were very good, and the servers assigned to us, Jordan and another young man (who's name I didn't catch), were very efficient and friendly.  I will not hesitate to hold another event here.    I was really very pleased.

I've been here several times with lackluster results.  Dirty dining area, poor customer service, slow service, etc..  Today I risked it again and ended up being so pissed I stormed out of there with my wilted, cold wrap in hand.  Never again.    I approached the counter and order a buffalo chicken wrap and asked what they had to drink aside from smoothies.  I didn't see the fountain drink machine where it used to sit in the lobby and I didn't feel like pounding down a calorie heavy smoothie as a drink along with my meal.   The employee said they had nothing BUT smoothies.  I said "Not even water?" and he said "No, we ran out of water bottles several days ago."  (Hold up, you guys ran out of water bottles several days ago and nobody has made any attempt to get any more since then?  In several days?  Even go to a local grocery store and buy a few cases...?)  So I order my wrap, with no drink, and the cashier tells me they'll bring my food out to me.  I say thanks and I tell him that I will be sitting in the outside seating.  (I really had to take a phone call and I didn't want to be rude to the inside dining room patrons by doing it there.) I sat outside and took my call and it lasted 20 minutes, in that time nobody brought a wrap out to me.   Finally I came inside and sat and waited another 10 minutes...  Eventually I got up and asked where my food was and the cashier walked into the back and in my line-of-sight asked the cooks where my buffalo chicken wrap was and I saw them point to the top of the kitchen shelf...he reached up and pulled down my wrap and sheepishly brought a cold, soggy wrap to me.  Nobody brought my wrap to me as promised!  Additionally, when they realized that someone hadn't received their food (or more like hadn't been "brought their wrap") they didn't even make an effort to keep calling that customer's name *occasionally* to try to locate that customer.  (Hint: Nobody drops $8 on a wrap at lunchtime and then just wanders away.)  No, they just shoved my wrap on a kitchen shelf and forgot about it for 30 minutes.  Grrr...  So at this point I'm late getting back to work, I'm thirsty and I'm furious.  I took my ridiculous cold, soggy wrap and left.  I get halfway to work and I open it at a red light to start eating it in my car and that's when I realized that they took the time to shove 2 different glossy, color printed promotional ads for Tropical Smoothie Café in there, but they didn't give me a single napkin ....incompetent donkeys!

My husband and kids brought me here for Mother's Day, and we started with delicious lunch at UnPhogettable and then made it over to the grocery store to pick up some Asian specialty items.    A few observations about the grocery store.    One is that the carts were nearly impossible to find.   My husband had to trek out to the parking lot to try and find me a cart while I waited inside the store, attempting to corral my wiggly three year old who strained against my iron grip so that she could run free in the maze of aisles and product displays.   Second the place was packed to the teeth.  I'm not sure if this is common here on a weekend or not, but it was wall to wall people and even finding parking was a challenge.  The sheer number of people made it difficult for me to navigate the extremely tightly packed aisles with my kids and my cart.  There was one aisle that was a hot mess of unpacked boxes in complete disarray, I couldn't get my cart down the aisle it so I just walked down it on foot to browse the items.  The crush of people also made for some very interesting people watching.  The highlight of the people watching was the older Asian lady that I watched as she, not so sneakily, ripped off a big chunk of Jackfruit from the cellophane wrapped Jackfruit display in the produce aisle and flipped the package over to conceal her wrongdoing.  She then proceeded to surreptitiously snack on her stolen fruit, dripping in her hand, as she pushed her cart around the produce aisle.  She was easily old enough to be my grandmother and utterly without shame in her act, I was pretty disgusted by her brazenness.  And FWIW, the Jackfruit was on sale for .99 a pound and the package she ripped open was probably two or three pounds, tops.    Thirdly, aside from the produce and the meat and seafood section, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the layout of the aisles in the store.  There was one aisle that I thought was the household products and beauty supplies, until I got midway down another aisle that was packed with cookies and candies and sauce mixes and I discovered another grouping of beauty supplies and incense in that aisle.  I'm not sure if maybe products were grouped by region of provenance or what...?  I couldn't find aisle markers to help me sort it out, so I just walked every aisle looking for what I needed.  The layout just didn't make any sense to me, period.  Lastly, the prices here seemed just a tad higher than they are at Ranch Market and Lee Lee's but they offer an automatic 10% discount at the register so it all washes out in the end.  I purchased at least 3 bags worth of items and all of it added up to just under $11.00 which I thought was a pretty good deal.  PS:  There was a stand just outside the store entrance and an employee was making honey cakes for.75 each..  While I was paying for the groceries my husband went over to the stand and got us 4 piping hot, honey cakes.  As I was loading my toddler in her car seat to leave my husband loaded the groceries in the back of the car and returned our cart to the store forgetting the bag of piping hot honey cakes in the cart!  We didn't realize it until we got all the way home.  My disappointment was obvious, my husband apologized profusely for his oversight!. (To whomever got our honey cakes, you're welcome!)

My new favorite Pho place in the Valley!    The restaurant was spotless and the service was impeccable.  The owner came by our table personally to apologize for our 5 minute wait for a table and he stayed behind to make small talk with my little girl about her Little Mermaid doll that she had with her.  I thought he was really friendly and gracious and he definitely made this the most friendly Vietnamese restaurant I've ever dined at in the Valley.  The food was extremely delicious.  I got the Bo Kho soup and it was fantastic; hot, meaty and flavorful.  My husband had a vegetarian stir fry and my son got the vegetarian Pho and they both loved their dishes as well.  My little daughter also really enjoyed her fried spring rolls and her fresh, young coconut drink that comes served in a glass, along with the coconut meat and a serving spoon.  This restaurant is a little farther from me than I would like, but I'll definitely try to make it a regular stop when I am over in this part of the Valley.

I came here on Saturday with my best friend.  We had a Groupon deal.  We were greeted right away and seated immediately.  The decor was pleasant enough, and our server (I didn't get her name) was REALLY good.  She took the time to explain the different dishes to us and helped me pick the right option.  They had a live guitarist who was quite good...she sang an assortment of popular songs to acoustic guitar.  We really enjoyed her music, her voice was soft and sweet, and it was mellow enough to enjoy and not have to shout at each other over the table.    We shared a chicken Satay as an appetizer, which was very yummy.  And for our main dishes and cocktails, my best friend LOVED her red curry, and her melon martini, and I really enjoyed my noodle dish with seafood and my alcoholic version of an Arnold Palmer cocktail.  The food was really, really delicious.     I'll go back FOR SURE.

I came here for Restaurant Week with my two girlfriends and we were served some of the most mouthwatering cuts of assorted roasted meats by some of the hottest Latin waiters I've ever laid eyes on...Holy smokes!!  0_0  You know what they say, come for the meat and stay for the meat.

I just had the most pleasant dental experience EVER here.  The entire office staff is efficient, gentle and super friendly.  I called last week, in pain, and explained that I had seen their reviews on Yelp and worked right down the way and could they see me?  And they squeezed me right in!  They also emailed me the paperwork to speed up the check in process and they even called me this morning with a cancellation and offered to take me even earlier today.  I am impressed with the ease of getting an appointment!     Also, when I walked in I liked that the office is clean and tastefully decorated with a good selection of reading materials, having both men and women's magazines.  (Not that I needed them though, because they whisked me straight back almost as soon as I sat down.)     The exam/treatment areas have TVs on the wall so you can distract yourself with what's on TV.  Today it was The Muppets pirate movie. (YAY, I LOVE THE MUPPETS!)  The dental assistant, Raquel, was super sweet and polite too.    The x-rays are taken in the chair and are shown to you instantaneously on a computer monitor placed on an exam table in front of the chair.  The dentist, Dr. Barela, was warm and friendly and never left me waiting for him to come see me.  He took the time to thoroughly explain everything on the x-rays and then he examined my teeth in detail and suggested a very reasonable course of treatment.  (Some dentists make me feel like they are suggesting such a radical treatment plan that I sometimes suspect that it's overkill just to make more money, but I didn't feel that here AT ALL!)  We both agreed that I needed just one filling and he asked if I'd like it done today...I was stunned.  A same day treatment, while I'm already here and ready to go?  Why yes, please, thank you!    He was ready to do the filling within minutes and he was super gentle and friendly.  He explained everything as he did the filling too, so I wasn't left there wondering what was going on the whole time.  Believe me, the whole process was PAINLESS.   While he was in there he also added some anti-sensitivity medicine to a couple of teeth that were a bit sensitive (but good otherwise) and he grinded down a high spot on a crown that I got a year ago that never did feel quite right.  I thought was was going above and beyond doing that, and I was impressed; really impressed!!  Folks, please believe me when I tell you I am a full blown, dental chicken after I had a root canal on a badly abscessed tooth when I was 19 that so painful and traumatic that other people could hear me screaming and sobbing clear out in the dentist's lobby. (Just the memory makes me ill...)  Dr. Barela had a tall order today to make me feel comfortable and not in fear or in pain and he did a wonderful job.   I am SO happy, he is now my new dentist!!  This place is great.  Oh, I almost forgot to mention that I needed to schedule a cleaning, and instead of the typical cleaning appointment that has to be scheduled weeks and weeks out, they actually had an appointment available for me next week at a time that actually works for me AND availability for my teenage daughter to her her teeth cleaned next week after school too.  They are very accommodating of your schedule and I really appreciated that flexibility.  This is a great dentist.  I couldn't recommend them any more highly!

I went today and had a cleaning here.  Again my treatment was gentle and all around awesome.  The warmth and genuine friendliness of the staff is the recurring theme here.  They are all just so darned nice!!  If you are looking for a dental office where you are treated like you really matter and almost like an old friend then this is THE place to call.  I swear, you WON'T regret it!

I received a bill for $28 in the mail from them and I couldn't figure out why...  I *thought* I'd paid for my filling in full on my first visit and my cleaning at my second visit was supposed to be free because of my insurance, so why was I getting a bill for $28??    I called and reached Cheryl at the front desk.  I explained to her that I got a bill and I wasn't sure why and within seconds she had pulled up my account history, it turns out that I overpaid for my filling and I had actually received a credit memo, not a bill!  :)   She said she was gonna have them generate a check and send it to me right away.  How awesome is that?  These guys really are the best at customer service!

I had to come try out the Central location of Postino's as I have only ever been to the Arcadia location.  I was not disappointed.  Not in the slightest!   The décor was beautiful and mood setting, the service was attentive and friendly, my wine, the Max Mann Riesling, was delicious and my soup and sandwich combination, the sausage and bean soup and prosciutto focaccia, was like a symphony in my mouth.   ^ In case you are wondering, that's like saying it was a party in my mouth, but classier.  Also, for all the old school Phoenicians, you'll understand when I say that I was able to sit there and magically transport myself back to the days when this was Katz Deli and I was eating another delicious sandwich in this very spot, about a million years ago.  I so easily visualized the old Katz deli counter right in front of me, it was kinda eerie..

Came here with my boyfriend.  As we were walking up we saw a couple sprawled, horizontally across each other, enthusiastically making out (dry humping) on the patio furniture in the almost empty, outdoor smoking area in full view of anyone that walked by.  We should have just left right then and there.  But no, we're hardy souls (and easily amused) so we ventured inside and were offered a seat at a high table that had a padded booth that runs the length of the South wall.  The problem with the booth seat was that it had a slight floor-bound tilt to it, so being in jeans I was in imminent danger of being dumped on my ass the entire time I was there.  I eventually turned sideways to brace myself on the stupid booth so I didn't shoot off the end, like a ski slope, and wind up in a crumpled heap underneath our high-top table.  Ridiculously awkward.  Our waitress was prompt, but our drinks were largely forgettable.  We opted not to order any food, despite the fact that they offered a 'Shannon Burger'.  I wasn't even tempted enough to stay with a burger that featured my name.  Eventually the doxy that was getting it on out on the patio, came sashaying into the bar area for more drinks, and she had that hardened look of a girl with daddy issues that'd been rode hard and hung up wet...sad.  She also had a familiarity in her interactions with the other waitresses and the bartender that made us both think she was somehow employed there or maybe a regular customer; not sure which, but we were sure by then it was time for us to leave.  The one redeeming thing I will mention about this place is that the décor was decent, staying in the Irish theme, and there are a TON of TV's showing different games, bar trivia, and one was even showing a movie so there is a distraction factor if watching drunken floozies isn't your style.

I love this Goodwill, it's clean and well organized and they really do make it nice to shop here.  The clothes are even color coordinated and in distinct, well organized sections.   Their half price events can't be beat for value and it's just the perfect place for the odd thing you find yourself needing now and again, or a good, cheap way to spend a weekend afternoon out of the Phoenix heat.  I scored an entire maternity wardrobe from this Goodwill for less than $50.  It was all nice, and gently used and would have cost me a few hundred dollars from the maternity store in the mall.  SCORE!  For the record not all Goodwills are the same.  There is another Goodwill at 32nd St and Thomas and it is an utter mess.  It smells like mildew and the clothes are falling off the racks, the aisles are jammed with merchandise in disarray and it's just an unpleasant place.  I refuse to go to that one when the 16th St. and Indian School location is so close and so much nicer.

This is a modest little place tucked into an unassuming Chandler strip mall.  Good food, low prices, generous portion sizes and exemplary, fast customer service are all reasons you should give it a try.    I had a Spicy Basil with chicken that was delicious.  My kids all had the Yellow Curry with chicken and they had no complaints about their food either.  Additionally, my 4 year old daughter spotted a strawberry milk the owner had in his refrigerator case (for himself, not a menu item) and she wanted to order it and I tried to explain to her that it wasn't on the menu but he insisted on giving it to her.  I thought that was very sweet.  Then as we were leaving he gave all of my kids little Thai fruit candies as we were leaving.  Try this little place, I think you'll be impressed!

I had dinner here with the husband a couple of weeks ago before we went to a Suns game.  We sat on the patio because the weather was brilliant.  The place is cute and the patio is really very pleasant.    I ordered a Zombie and a Painkiller cocktail (don't judge, I was rocking a migraine and desperately needed relief), and each one was nice and potent.  My husband just had iced tea.    I searched the menu for something with shrimp in it, but I was seriously left wanting in that department.  Instead I ordered a starter of lobster bisque and another starter of tuna ceviche.  The soup was hot and quite flavorful, but I would have liked a few more pieces of lobster meat.  The ceviche was extremely good and was served with flash fried wonton 'chips'.  I really liked it and my only criticism was that it was the lime juice was overpoweringly tangy and it could have benefitted from some avocado chunks to help cut down the tang a little bit.  My husband had the black bean burger which he said was really, really delicious.  All in all it was a good visit, and aside from our server not refilling our drinks in a very timely manner it was a good dinner out and I expect we'll be back.

Delicious margaritas in a beautiful setting with stellar customer service.    A margarita on the rocks with no salt is my go-to drink and it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of margaritas at different bars and restaurants all across the Valley and this one was THE BEST, hands down.    It was expertly mixed, with just the right amount of alcohol and citrus tanginess, served tall, on the rocks and garnished with slices of lemon and lime and most importantly NO salt.  You can ruin a margarita for me by ignoring my 'no salt' request, thankfully our server was paying close attention.  Rumor has it, there was food in front of me too, but it was secondary to that amazing margarita.  So for those nights where I prefer to drink my dinner (don't judge) this is the place.   Margaritas: Not *just* for breakfast anymore.

So we had dinner here last night; the service was slower than a herd of turtles stampeding through peanut butter, and I was even tempted to cancel our order and walk out, but we didn't.  We waited for our food and when it finally arrived it was very tasty, as is always the case at IHOP.  But the wait, oh holy cow that wait was something else...  I've been here numerous times in the past and never experienced a wait like that before.   They must've been training a new cook or something...  Also, annoyingly our waitress failed to mention that kids eat free between 4 and 8 PM and so not wanting to order a $4.00+ dinner for my toddler (who'd waste most of it by playing with it) I just had her eat off of my plate. We did order a kid's meal for our 6 year old son though.  It wasn't until we got to the register and we're told by the cashier told that kid's eat free every day between 4 and 8 PM, and that they'd take the cost of my son's dinner off of the bill.  That was nice to know after the fact, but it would have been VERY helpful to know that when we were ordering too.  That way I could have had more of my own food, instead of sacrificing about a quarter of it for my daughter to mash in her tiny fists and attempt to throw it on the floor. (I don't think she actually ate more than two tablespoons worth!)  My husband ordered the 'make your own omelet' deal with spinach and tomatoes and he absolutely loved it.  He raved about it afterwards.  Our son ordered a chocolate chip, smiley face pancake which he devoured, and I had the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, 2 bacon strips and hash browns combo dinner.  It was all very, very good.    I'll tell you what, people can make all the high-brow comments they want about how IHOP is so pedestrian and mundane, but damn, they do pancakes PERFECTLY.  I'm not a food elitist, but I certainly know yummy food when I see it.  Let's be honest, I'm not going there for the hipster vibe, or to check in on Foursquare and take pictures of my food with Instagram, or because it's some cutesy boutique-fair trade-vege-soy-atarian-blah-blah-hip place that all the critics are swooning over.  Nope, I go there because their pancakes are delicious and their prices are reasonable.  You should go there too.  PS:  Their new cook (if that's what the problem was last night) better get their act together ASAP.  When a die-hard IHOP fan is contemplating canceling their dinner order and leaving over the wait then you are *officially* taking too damn long to deliver the food!

These guys just replaced the cracked windshield on my Volvo.    They did an amazing job, going above and beyond, by replacing the broken clips on the trim piece on my A Pillar while they where there (clips broken during another windshield replacement by a certain unnamed glass company.)  They were efficient, friendly and on-time.  I would not hesitate to use them again in a heartbeat!

We got a little Usedbaru (Used Subaru, get it???) from these guys a few weeks ago and the whole experience was pleasant.    We never felt hounded, scammed or pressured and we love the ultra clean, little Outback Sport that my husband traded across for his Jeep Wrangler.    Very nice cay buying experience!

Fabulously strong (and well priced) margaritas, served in a no-nonsense, working class, punk/alt rock bar with occasional theme events and live bands, AND it's close enough for me to walk to/stumble home from??      Yes please!

Got my boyfriend a white rum cake with vanilla cream for his birthday.  While ordering it online they ask you to chose 2 colors for the cake decoration; I picked green and yellow.  I went to pick up the cake on the big day and as Lisa opened the box to show me the final product she said "Packers fan?"    Nailed it.     And the cake was yummy, by the way!

I use this pediatrician's office for all 4 of my kids, from a baby to teenager.  They are efficient, clean, friendly and accommodating.    We've been going here for 2+ years and over that span of time we have seen all 4 (5?) of the providers and we have to say that, hands down, Casey Miles is our favorite.  The other Doctors are all great, but Casey and my kids just seem to really connect.  A few times I've called Phoenix Children's Center receptionists and explained that my child was pretty ill and they've always found a way to squeeze us into the schedule at the last minute.  In fact, one time my 10 month old was so sick that she barfed all over the sick-kids waiting room without hardly a seconds warning.  It was ghastly, I felt awful about the mess, but they took it in stride and made me feel less like someone who's kid had just left a huge bio-hazzard in their waiting room, and more like a poor mommy who was under enormous stress with a sick baby.  In fact, that very same visit, Casey Miles decided she thought my baby was sick enough to go straight to Phoenix Children's Hospital and she called ahead to the PCH ER to help speed us though the waiting room.  (She was right too, my daughter was admitted to PCH for almost 9 days!)  Anyway, if you are looking for a good pediatrician in the Central Phoenix area these guys are top notch.  In fact, I have to go there again this very afternoon with a sick teenager...  *sigh*

This Goodwill is much better than many I've been to, in fact it may be my favorite one, and I really know my way around the Valley's second hand stores...  The store is clean and bright, the employees are very friendly, the aisles are organized and it doesn't smell like grandma's underwear drawer.    A big bonus for me is their $1 Thursdays: Everything with that day's colored tag is $1.  You can find some AWESOME stuff for just a buck.  SCORE!

I suffer from horrible, head splitting, pulse pounding migraines.  I am also a patient of Dr. Herrera at Complete Care Medicine *despite* the fact that I live in Central Phoenix...many, many miles away.  He has a wonderful bedside manner and he really listens to your concerns.  Because a low pressure system is moving across Arizona today (and low barometric pressure seems to be a trigger for my migraines) I could feel one start to pulse deep in my brain.  Attempting to cut it off at the pass, I quickly grabbed for the prescription strength migraine pain pills I always carry in my purse only to realize, much to my horror, that I was down to just one pill and that it was lunch time on a Friday and Dr. Herrera's office closes early on Fridays!  In desperation I called my pharmacy and asked if the pharmacy could initiate a refill request with the doctor, but they explained that because these pills are a controlled substance that they must be refilled by a written prescription, and can't be refilled electronically.    I quickly called Dr. Herrera's office and spoke to the appointment scheduler who was very sweet.  I explained my predicament to her and she made an appointment for me with Dr. Herrera for his soonest available opening and she also volunteered to go ask him if he would refill my migraine pain prescription in the meantime.  She told me she'd ask and call me right back if she was able to get him to approve it, but she warned me that because they closed early today the soonest I would be able to pick it up would probably be on Monday.  Well, not only did she keep her word and call me right back regarding the status of an emergency refill of my medicine, but she also told me that despite the fact that their office was going to close in 7 minutes, if I could make it over there within the next half an hour Dr. Herrera would stay behind after they closed just to wait for me so I could pick up my refill paperwork from him.  I drove over there as fast as my pounding head would allow me and made it in time to get my refill script from Dr. Herrera!    I am eternally grateful to both of them for going the extra mile for me today, migraines suck and clearly they understand that and sympathize. Thank you guys!

Hhhhmp.  I had a big fat gift certificate to use here and so I made an appointment for a salon cut and style and a pedicure.  What a let down.    Firstly let me say that the lady that cut my hair spent a few minutes examining my hair and asking me how I care for it and wear it, which was a good sign that she was gonna really listen to me and what kind of cut I needed and wanted.  Sadly it ended there.    We went from the hair wash station to the cutting chair where she asked me if she could take 2 to 3 inches off, and I said okay.  So she started cutting, and cutting and cutting and then she asked me to stand up because my hair is so long she needed to cut even more of it so it would clear the back of the hair.  Folks, believe me, she cut off far more than 2 to 3 inches.    Next thing I know the receptionist brings over a woman and introduces her as the technician's next appointment and then seats her about 5 feet away from us.  This must've put the stylist into a tizzy time wise because now she subtly complaining about how thick my hair is and how she's struggling to blow dry it all out and straighten it.  Ironically my hair is 90% already, except for a small wavy part in the very back. Then I heard her quickly say something about thinning it out in the back and the next thing I know she's thinning out huge sections of my hair in the back without even confirming that this is what I wanted!!  I didn't know what to think.  I asked her what was gonna happen when I tried to put my hair in a ponytail now and she assured me that I won't be able to tell, because she cut it all out of the center of my hair (?) but still, shouldn't she have asked me if it was okay first?  I assume she did it because my thick hair was taking too long to blow dry and she was pressed for time.     Anyway, she finished off the styling that she decided I wanted on my hair and turned me out if the chain and pointed me in the direction to go pay.  Never once did she ask me what style I wanted that day, she just basically cut my hair and blow dried it straight.  I had to go home and curl my hair the way I'd hope was included in my visit that day when I asked for a cut and style.  What a disappointment.  Then I went to get my pedicure.  The place was jam packed with ladies trying to get their nails done before Easter so I knew I was gonna be rushed in and out of there, whatever.    Well my pedicure went fine and dandy all the way up to the point that I pulled my feet out from under the UV drying light and looked down at them only to see that they were dull and flat with no shiny top coat at all.  I showed them to the guy that directs the customers to the different nail techs and he went and got the lady that did my toes (she was already working on someone else) and she said I probably just chose a flat color.    Huh?  What??  A flat color?  First off I only had the vaguest recollection of ever knowing that such a thing even exists, but secondly, shouldn't flat nail polish colors be in a different section, or clearly marked or something so this doesn't happens??  So she gave me a second coat of clear polish over the top really quick (which promptly wrinkled my flat nail polish and make it look worse) and I left out of there extremely disappointed in the whole experience.  I still have a huge balance on my gift certificate and I'm not sure what spa experience I want to try next.  I'm almost afraid of more disappointment.  :(

Okay, I went back to use up the balance on my gift certificate and this next visit was MUCH-O BETTER-O.    This time I got the same hair stylist and she took more time to ask me what I wanted done and explain what she was gonna so and to style my hair properly, not just rush me out of there as fast as she could.  I was a lot happier with the results this time.  A LOT.  I also got another pedicure with better results this time too.   They have redeemed themselves to me.  :)

Yesterday I came here with my teenage daughter for a dual pedicure.  We opted for the VIP Spa Pedicure at $42 each.    The pedicures were fine, but what I'm upset about was that my technician coated my big toenails in about 3 thick coats of nail polish and it was so thick that (even after sitting under the UV light at the salon for 5 minutes) 3 hours later when I put on my shoes to go out for the night, my polish squished off and was completely destroyed!    You can only imagine how devastated I was after paying $100 for both of us, after gratuity, to have a pedicure ruined like that 3 hours later...definitely unhappy.

I had to come here for for the first time the other day to make a mortgage payment on my rental house that would have been late if I had mailed it, like I normally do.    I was greeted at the door by an friendly employee who directed me to a teller for my transaction.  They also had what appeared to be a complimentary hot coffee station by the door as well.  That was a nice touch.  The line moved very quickly and when I got to the teller she politely greeted me and I explained that I needed to make my first ever, in-person mortgage payment because it was nearly past due and she said 'no problem' and was extremely efficient in handling my paperwork.  I think she was finished crediting my account within 90 seconds.  Yay!  Overall this was a pleasant experience, and aside from gagging from the strong smell of cigarette smoke wafting off the guy in line in front of me, I enjoyed the experience at this Wells Fargo.

My baby daughter goes here and I am very pleased with the level of interaction and care she receives.    When I was looking for a daycare for her I toured several, and even considered the same daycare that my 5 year old son had attended for the last 4 years right down the road (but had left a few months prior due to his recent attitude problems at that daycare).  I needed to know that my tiny, fragile, premature daughter would be in good hands.  I graded the daycare centers that I toured on the compassion I felt and level of competency I sensed from the daycare director, the interaction from the teachers and amenities I noted in the baby room, the cleanliness of the facility and the general sense I had of the place.  The weekly price wasn't my main concern, although it CERTAINLY wasn't a non-issue.    One daycare I looked at seemed nice (they even had a sign in the lobby stating that they watched children free of charge for interviewing parents, which I thought was sweet) but I didn't like the way the place smelled and the baby room seemed too small.  Another place didn't have an appropriate outdoor play place for the tots, and that wasn't okay with me, even though in every other sense they were a contender.  But when I toured Maxwell I was very impressed with the whole center.  The center was spacious, bright, colorful and had lots and lots of children's artwork decorating the walls.  Although my child is far too small for it, there is a RAD, two-story indoor play town with a slide and other neat things for the older kids for when it is too hot for them to safely play on the outside playground.  The director, Kristin, was knowledgeable and attentive to my questions.  The baby room teachers seemed sincere and down to earth, and the baby room itself was clean, bright and colorful.  I read though the parent handbook and the enrollment paperwork they offered, and somewhere in the explanation of what services they guaranteed to provide to your child on a daily basis was a promise that they would hug your child each day.  I thought that was neat.  (I mean, it's assumed that a daycare will be affectionate and caring towards your small child when you take them there, but how many of them actually promise you that your child will get a hug each day??)  Anyway, the rates and registration fees were competitive and everything else checked out with me so I enrolled my baby there.  Now, we've been going there almost a year, and to be honest there have been one or two times where I was annoyed at other parents for doing some (thoroughly) annoying things, like clogging up the circular driveway in front as they leisurely dropped off their child and chatted with other people in the hallway (as opposed to parking over in the parking lot if they wanted to take their sweet time in the daycare center and saving the driveway for the parents in a hurry), or even worse people parking behind me in the driveway when I already had someone parked in front of me and basically trapping my car as I waited for either one of them to move so I could get out (GRR!!).  But overall I am very, very happy.  My baby girl LOVES her morning and afternoon teachers, and has no separation issues at all when I drop her off because she is always so excited to see them and start playing.    And I can tell that they genuinely love her over there.  In fact, she had a small surgery that required a two night hospital stay not long after we started going to MPA and her teacher called to check on her condition after her surgery.  Then she got really sick earlier this year with RSV and spent two different stints at Phoenix Children's Hospital, of more than a week each stay, not only did MPA NOT charge me for the time she was away (believe it or not, some places actually would) but they also made her a get well card that had at least a dozen teachers signatures and messages for her written on there, and her morning teacher also came clear over to PCH to see her and give her hugs!  She was so happy to see her.  :)  That meant a lot to me.    Also, twice now my vacation time has fallen about 4 weeks before my bi-annual vacation credit was due and they still let me take the week off without a charge.  It was SO appreciated during these very tight times!  Anyway, this is a GREAT daycare center!  Love them! :)

Took my little here last night for her free birthday ice cream cone, because she's a member of the Baskin Robbins Birthday Club.    I sincerely don't understand the negative reviews!!  The place was spotlessly clean, the music wasn't too loud, and the teenage boy working behind the counter was friendly and even wished my daughter a happy birthday!  Perhaps my only criticism was that there isn't an option to add a tip for the counter employee on the receipt, and I never carry cash anymore, so I couldn't tip the friendly counter employee!  Yes, I would come back here in a heartbeat, in fact I plan on it. :)

Huge selection, friendly employees, great holiday items, lots of coupons and special deals,  Walgreens is the go-to store for middle of the night cold medications and the random gallon of milk and some bread.  They are consistently a 4 star store.

I hosted a pre-chemotherapy get together at Saddle Ranch Chop House for a girlfriend of mine that's facing down breast cancer last night and I was NOTHING but impressed with the level of service from everyone, the quality of the food, and professionalism from our server, Teresa.  From the manager that checked in on us last night to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, right down to the employee that took my initial phone call and made the reservation for my event a week ago.  Good work, guys!    Saddle Ranch took care of every detail for us and was very attentive to our needs last night; making sure that our table was set up and decorated with balloons before we arrived, to surprising our whole table (adults only) with a round of pink lemonade vodka shots and two towers of pink cotton candy for our table!    Really I could not be more pleased with them and wanted to thank them personally on Yelp for the excellent service at my friend's very important night out last night.    Thank you guys for making my friend's night special!

I'll admit it, I don't know much about the kind of Ramen that doesn't come in a small dehydrated square with a silver seasoning packet, but I really, really liked my food here!   The price seems a smidge high for what you are ordering, but we did get a crap-load of food for our money!  I ordered the traditional pork ramen and my husband got the spicier version with tofu and we both really liked our food.  Our daughter snacked on a bowl of soybeans and a strawberry icee boba drink and the occasional noodle she swiped from our bowls.    The place is cute with a slight hipster, college kids vibe, which means my husband and I were wildly out of place with our messy haired toddler and our frazzled thirty-something parent look.     (Okay, okay...forty-something.  You caught me.)  And being a crotchety old fart, I will also mention the only thing my husband and I didn't care for was the music blaring overhead, but that's okay since I don't suspect we are their primary demographic target, and our 1970's punk music probably won't go over too well with the hipster college set...amiright?  ;-)

Everyone should go to a drive in movie at least once in their lives, and Phoenix is damn lucky to still have one.  My family loves this place.  I saw Escape from New York here way back in 1981 with my parents.  And while my parents were transfixed on the action movie in front of them, my little brother and I were looking out the back window in utter amazement at the cartoon Heavy Metal playing across the drive in...hehehe...  (Boy, was THAT an eye opener for a couple of doe eyed kids who'd only seen G-Rated cartoons like Looney Toons up to that point!)  Anyway, this is THE place to go if you are taking babies or fidgety, wiggly, talkative little children to see a movie....that pretty much describes MY kids.  Mom and dad can watch a movie and tend to their chatty, wiggle-worms without disturbing the other patrons.  Another huge bonus is that you can bring in your own food from the outside so you can make it a very budget friendly night out and bring a $5 pizza and bottled water from home.  Although they do keep their admission prices extremely low, it's no secret that they hope to backfill that financial loss by purchases from the concession stand, so please do the theater management a huge favor and at least buy some popcorn.  ;)    We definitely WANT this drive in to stay in business, it's one the last ones in the country.  :)    And for those that worry incessantly that they'll be 'jacked' or shot at while going to the west side, please don't.  The west side may have some sketchy looking neighborhoods and a little more graffiti, but there are plenty of dodgy, crime infested holes in pockets of the east valley too.  Most of the people in old Glendale are just normal folk like you and me, raising kids, paying bills and clipping coupons to get by.  Cut them a break and try not to look down your nose at them or stereotype them too badly while you enjoy this gem of a drive in on the west side...  In fact, to do my part I'm taking my whole litter here this Saturday because it's cheap (and I'm broke) and little ones desperately want to see ParaNorman.  Should be fun!

We went here this weekend and had a good time.  We saw ParaNorman.  I do have a couple of new observations that I didn't mention in the first review though...  It'd be nice if the management would reconsider the golf cart that drives up and down the aisles selling glow sticks and assorted snacks during the movie.  I can certainly understand the desire for delivered snacks, but the glow sticks?  No.    I got stuck behind a family of six little kids that all started screaming for glow sticks as soon as the golf cart drove by them and I had to try and visually and mentally block out the glow stick swinging, screaming kids for probably 10 minutes as the dad arranged the purchase of the six glow sticks with the vendor.  It was annoying as hell and I missed that portion of the movie as I tried to ignore them.  Since these are double features, can't they wait and sell these things between the movies?  Or just sell them up at the concession stand?  Finally, I don't think the theater should sell tickets in the middle of the movie.  Sell them BEFORE each movie and maybe up to the first ten minutes after a movie starts, and then just make people wait to come in if they've arrived after that.  We had probably 5 cars pull in somewhere between 20 minutes and 45 minutes after the movie started and we were blinded by their headlights as they parked.  Annoying.   I love the drive in and I really don't like to deduct a star.  But these are very annoying things that the management should reexamine so that they can make sure that each patron has a wonderful, uninterrupted experience.

My husband and I each got a pedicure here on a date night a few weeks ago.  Is that weird?  I hope not.  I actually got the suggestion for this place for a 'His and Hers' Pedi from another Yelper.   See, we'd been working all week to remodel our house and we just needed a break mentally and physically so we made plans to get pedicures and a dinner out as a reward for all our hard work.  To my husband's relief there were many other guys in there getting pedicures that evening with their wives/girlfriend's so I guess we must've come to the right place for a unisex pedicure.    The ladies that worked on our feet were both competent and our feet were well pampered and groomed, but I have to mention that the woman that worked on my feet was just sour faced.  No attempt at friendliness at all.  :/  Oh well, my husband's nail tech was sweet so she made up the difference.  My husband kept saying that he wanted the same polish color that I was getting and he's such a joker that I think he probably would've done it if I hadn't put my foot down and threatened to rip up his man card for even suggesting it.  LOL!  Anyway, if you are looking for an unusual date night experience try coming here for a unisex pedicure, it *really* isn't as unheard of as you may think!

This place is a jam packed, hardcore candy warehouse.    It's not cutsey and it doesn't have playful little candy displays, but they have almost any candy you can imagine or remember from your days past.  Racks, bins and shelves stacked with taffies, Moonpies, chocolates galore, novelty candies, candy sticks, jelly beans, bubble gums, pinwheel suckers, malted candies, sugar free stuff, gummie thingies, wax lips, licorice whips, etc..     You having a candy bar at your wedding or party?  You are gonna wanna come here FIRST, just trust me on this.  The prices are fair and the staff is very nice and they offer a punch card to customers for repeat visits.  SCORE!    This *is* Candy Mecca and I honestly make a sacred pilgrimage here at least once a year.

I checked this place out with my teenage daughter this weekend.  It's big, bright, clean, the carts all looked serviceable and the produce, bakery, meat and seafood sections were amazing.  There was also another ethnic food deli (?) that was staffed with employees who were helping people with their selections.  I wasn't sure what everything was in there, but it looked like some Mexican cheeses and creams, some deli meats, and some other assorted ethnic deli take-and-eat items.  Anyway, it was really very cool.    The only three drawbacks for me was that the smell from the seafood section was quite strong, which is to be expected really when you offer a selection of seafood that big, but still, you've been warned that you get occasional wafts of a scent that can *only* be described as a 'hooker's crotch at high noon in July on Fisherman's Wharf'.  (Don't judge.  We all have our skeletons.)  The dry good aisles didn't have a large variety of different brand names.  To be clear, they have all the ITEMS that you need: cereal, cake mix, paper plates, laundry soap, soda, etc, but they may not have as wide of selection of different brands as you are used to at say, a WalMart or Fry's.  For instance I wanted some Jiffy Baking Mix, but they only carry Bisquick.  No big deal, really.  And finally, I got an 8" ready made flan from the refrigerated bakery case that looked pretty good ($5.99) but it was utterly tasteless and had a too-rubbery texture that I didn't like.  It was just overly sweet, with no vanilla, or caramel taste to it at all.  I've made FAR BETTER in my own kitchen.  Just skip the flan. ;)   Anyway, overall this was a pleasant experience and the prices were quite reasonable, I'll be back.  :)

So my best friend in the whole world (and another Yelper) was born on New Year's Day, and her daughter was also born the same day.  (What are the odds??)   They wanted an intimate get together to celebrate both of their recent birthdays and this restaurant was their choice.     Okay, no point in beating around the bush...I'll just come right out and say it; our waitress was friggen awful.  She left us high and dry for several minutes at a time and she completely forgot to bring me a high chair.  Finally after waiting for about 30 minutes for her to remember to bring me a high chair, another diner at our table went and found one since I was having trouble keeping my wiggly daughter sitting on my lap.    And I could make a big deal about the fact that we were seated for probably 30 minutes before she even took our orders, and probably about 25 more minutes before they brought us our appetizers, and that she never even once asked if we wanted to see a drink menu and I finally had to ask if they even offered cocktails and that finally prompted her to produce a drink menu about 20 minutes and another request later (20 minutes, I'm not kidding).    Since my husband doesn't drink and is my permanent designated driver, and we were celebrating, I got a pineapple mojito, minus the pineapple.  No, I didn't order my pineapple mojito without the pineapple, it just came that way.  So it was just a mojito flavored mojito.  Now, to be fair it was still a damn tasty mojito, but I don't think it had passed within 22' feet of a pineapple, EVER.  I'm just saying.'  Our waitress obviously didn't notice that when she got our order from the bartender either.  I just have to repeat it; she really isn't very good at what she does.  I'm sorry, I know that is harsh.  And despite the fact that I was in a party of three (yes, I knew the other diners, but we were all on separate checks) I still got hit with an automatic 18% gratuity for a large party.  WTF?  Really?! Ugh...     But then let's talk about the food.  When they finally decided to serve us food it was a mixed experience.  My baby daughter got a tempura plate and I think she really enjoyed it.  She ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed dipping her fried shrimp and veggies in the dipping sauce.  I tasted her food and it wasn't bad at all.  And the mushroom soup that comes as an appetizer with the teppan entrees is delicious.  I mean really, really good.  I don't know how they prepare it, but it was staggeringly good and I would've consumed a gallon of that stuff.  Also, the salad with orange ginger dressing was very cold and crisp and delicious too.    For dinner my husband ordered the vegetarian teppan and I ordered the combo teppan dinner with scallops and sirloin steak.  (Side note: I love scallops, but the last 3 times I had them prepared in a restaurant I had gotten violently ill.  I knew I was taking my chances with getting another bad batch, but I wanted scallops again so bad I decided to roll the dice.)  The good news?  I didn't get sick afterwards, these scallops were very fresh.  The bad news?  They were so fresh that they still had fresh little pieces of sand embedded all throughout them.  You never want to bite into a scallop and hear a crunch:  EVER.   Also my food was horribly over salted, and I do mean horribly.   I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to salt, but this was too much salt, even for me.  Also, my scallops were done cooking a full 15 minutes before my medium rare steak was done.  That kinda sucked as they could have easily been timed better by the chef.  Our chef was very friendly.  The fried rice that comes as a side with the teppan dinner was pretty good, but nowhere near as garlic-buttery-tastic and delicious as the chicken fried rice served at another unnamed teppan place that I routinely go to in Tempe...  The damage for our whole dinner and my drink was about $70, so it wasn't too bad in the grand scheme of fresh prepared teppan dinners.  I just wish the service had been better and the scallops hadn't been full of sand.   But you know what's most important? That my best friend and niece had a great birthday party.  And at the end of the night, despite the hiccups with the food and service, I think they did have a good time.  And THAT is *still* what matters most to me.  PS:  Sandy scallops=YUCK!

When you have a toddler AND a bathroom in the middle of a major renovation, it is highly advised to protect the open toilet drain from random objects being inserted into it by said toddler...  This weekend my husband soundly chewed me out because, according to him, in my haste to complete the long delayed bathroom project, I prematurely removed the wad of plastic grocery bags that he had shoved in the open floor drain to protect it from the aforementioned toddler.    After reinstalling our toilet we discovered that the toilet drain was now hopelessly clogged.    We tried plunging it. We tried snaking it. We even tried chemical main line drain cleaner.  Nada, zip, zilch.  It was blocked solid and bubbling up into the shower when we ran water into that drain.    CRAP!!! (Literally.)  In desperation I turned to Yelp for a plumber and here I found Ron and his company.  I called Ron at 7 AM today and left a message, explaining my issue and asking if there was any chance he could come by today since I was off work.  Not only did he call me right back, but he was on his way to my house within an hour and within 20 minutes had found the problem and fixed it!  Not only did he clear the main line obstruction, but he ALSO reinstalled my toilet for me as a favor! Folks, I could not be more impressed!  I will definitely be calling him again anytime I have a plumbing issue.  Heck, Ron even invited me to call him if I just have a plumbing question!  How many professionals offer that kind of service?  So, to sum it up:  Main line snaked and obstruction removed by the nicest plumber in Phoenix? $120 Discovering that the obstruction was *actually* a plastic grocery bag placed there by my husband?  PRICELESS. Bouquet of roses from embarrassed husband? $20

Ron came to help me with yet another plumbing problem today and this time he also walked me through the repair, step by step, so that I knew how to fix it myself next time.  I love that, because it means he's taking the time to really help his customer, not just solve their immediate issue at that particular moment.  Oh, and then I went to pay him and he tried to refuse any payment calling it a favor instead!  He really is too nice.  I insisted he let me pay him for his time though, he's totally worth every penny and more. From now on out he's my go-to guy for plumbing issues!   Call him if you need help with your plumbing, you can thank me later!

If you have to have a person all up in your girl bits to help you wax then you need that person to be Dannielli  at Suddenly Slimmer/Rio Wax Salon.  She is the undisputed Queen of Waxing, and I first 'met' her back in 2004 when she gave me my first proper waxing.    She truly knows her technique (she actually IS Brazilian), she knows her wax and she's sincere and friendly too.  It's like having your most trusted girlfriend helping you out with your girl bits when you go see her, there is no awkwardness and she just keeps the conversation flowing so well that you *almost* don't think about on what's going on with your Southern landscaping...    Simply put she is the best in all of Arizona at this kind of thing, and while she is probably not accepting new waxing clients (I know that because she told me last night), she is so good that it bears repeating from me that she remains the Queen of Waxing.

All About Serving just served my evasive ex husband who'd already dodged a different process server I'd served at least 3 times.  Their server was resourceful and clever in catching him and getting the papers served.  Not only did they get the job done for me in less than 24 hours, but they picked up the papers from me within an hour of my inital call, took online payments which speeds up the process (my last process server didn't and the delay sucked, a lot), they were courteous, professional and kept me informed of what was going on with my papers.    I'm VERY pleased.  I highly recommend them.  :)

I really owe Caketini this review, I am in remiss.  I've been here half a dozen times in the last year getting cupcakes (and a beautiful birthday cake for my oldest daughter) and I STILL haven't reviewed them yet, I suck.  Okay, okay....on to the review.  In case you don't know, Caketini's cupcakes are the bomb diggity.  Yup, that's a fact.  They may be hella expensive at just over $4 per cupcake, but I assure you they are worth it if you want to 'treat yo self'.  I've had several of their flavors and they are all amazing.  I also tried their carrot cake and it was downright sinful.  Anyway, my favorite Caketini cupcake flavor is their coconut cupcake.  It's light and velvety smooth, and buttery and coconuty and all around amazing.  I literally sit at my desk and day dream about those damn things.  So, I came here once more last Tuesday night to get myself a celebratory cupcake.  I was feeling pretty good about life; I'd just had a really positive job interview that afternoon and they'd already called me back for a second interview so I felt like my prospects on the job lead were good so I decided to treat myself to a $4 cupcake.    Me: Yes!  That interview went great!!  Treat yo self! Bank Account: Hmmm...as long as it's just one cupcake. Me: You're not the boss of me, bank account! Bank Account:  We'll see about THAT.  So, I listened to my stingy bank account and made my purchase of just one cupcake, and I lovingly cradled that beauty in its little Styrofoam case all the way out to my car.  My new coconut flavored best friend and I drove home and just as I was getting out of the car and about to go inside, and do unspeakable things to my beautiful cupcake, it somehow jumped from my hands and crashed to the driveway below!  Noooooo!!  Yep...it committed cupcake suicide.  I was devastated.  I had a moment of silence there on the driveway and scraped all of the body that I could up off of the concrete, and carried the remains inside and ate its mangled body in privacy.    (What's with the disgusted look??  I said I was INTERVIEWING for a job, I don't have the damn job yet...I can't afford to let this delicious $4 driveway-cupcake go to waste!!)  Moral of the story?  Caketini's cupcakes are so good they'll reduce you to eating off of the drive way too.    Proceed with caution on this addiction.

The food here was very good, but I'd suggest you open your patio for more seating as this place is a claustrophobics worst nightmare.  I seriously wished I'd taken my food to go.     And if you are running the register and a customer shows you a picture of a plate of delicious tacos from your own restaurant on your own restaurant's Yelp page on the Yelp mobile app and asks you if you know what kind of tacos they are don't give them an annoyed glare and say "How am I supposed to know?!?!"   Uh, you are supposed to be able to identify your menu items because you are running the register, and because your menu doesn't exactly give a lot of description to your different offerings, and because it's just good customer service?     I'll be trying this place again because everything was tasty the last time (for basically ordering the items blind) but if I get treated like an idiot for a simple inquiry again I definitely won't be back.

My husband and I just had the best dinner in a long time here.    The service was top notch.   Our host and server Derrick (I'm awful with names but I *think* that was he said his name was) was informative, attentive and extremely friendly.  He didn't even flinch when I took one look at the uber-busy dining room and asked if we could sit outside instead (I shy away from crowded places) and he went out of his way to take great care of us tonight.  He gave us great service, and I am very critical about service standards.  (I mystery shopped for several years, it's to be expected from me...lol!)  The food was wonderful and because we were both new to the dish of Pho, Derrick was very informative, instructing us on the proper way to season our soups and how it's eaten.  The spring rolls were very good, I got the seared tuna roll and my husband got the vegetarian Buddha roll.    And the ginger creme brulee we split for dessert was delicious!   The ginger flavor was really intriguing and the sugar crust was perfect.  Dinner with my husband made it extra special! :-)  The one and only drawback to this place is the stucktastic parking situation.  They really need to move to a bigger place where they'll have more parking.  It is hard to even get a spot here.    So, other than having to park across the street and walk over, we had a wonderful dinner and I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner.     Note to self:  I'll have to check it out for lunch sometime!

This is one of my favorite Chinese buffet places and it's pretty close to home so we come here fairly often.    I came here on Friday night with my husband and my toddler daughter.  We were charged about $22.50 for two adult dinners (baby is free) and a hot tea for my husband (just water for me and the baby.)  The host went out of his way to find a plastic spoon and fork for our little daughter...I thought that was nice of him.  Their service is very friendly, and in fact I have always been treated extremely well by the staff every time we've ever come.  Their service is so friendly and the food is so tasty that I actually rented out their private back room for my daughter's 16th birthday party last year.     The food was very good on this visit, and I really enjoyed the fried catfish, green beans, fried chicken, seafood delight, baked mussels and the Char Siu Bao (steamed pork buns).  They also have a nice sushi offering and a nice salad bar and dessert selection although I didn't have anything from those cases on this visit. Also, I've never tried it so I don't know how it is; but they also offer Mongolian BBQ too.    The only thing I would mention that was negative about this visit was that our table, while it appeared to be clean, was actually sticky.  I'm assuming it was wiped off with an already sticky rag.      Overall this is a good buffet.  I would suggest them, as long as they make sure the tabletops aren't sticky.

Came here on Tuesday and saw Gabbi for a Brazilian.  She did an EXCELLENT job.  She went above and beyond and took her time to double check and get everything so that once I got home, I didn't need to contort myself into some impossible, position in front of my mirror to tweeze anything she missed.  I booked a follow up with her before I left, I was that impressed.  Thank you, Gabbi!

I brought my littest Little here for a special treat after her recent doctor visit; she had to get immunizations in order to get ready for Kindergarten, and in my family shots *always* require post appointment ice cream....STAT.   I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries, lemonade, and a 'Dirt Cup' for us to share.  The chicken sandwich was hot, juicy and delicious.  The fries and their special fry sauce was really unique and yummy.  (We didn't leave a single fry survivor, we killed them all.)  And her frozen 'Dirt Cup' vanilla custard with gummy worms and chunks or Oreo cookie was creamy, smooth and perfect for curing post-shot frowns.  The restaurant was spotless and the employees that served us all displayed a high level of customer service and were extremely friendly and efficient.  We left there very impressed an will definitely return again soon!

I came here with my 2 brothers and my husband last week for an early birthday dinner.  All three of us have birthdays in the same week; clearly our parents mating habits were pretty predictable.  We were blown away at the decor, the food and the service.  OUTSTANDING!  Let me start with the decor, the place is fabulous and very well designed.  The displays are creepy and high quality, and the lighting is good.  The only possible suggestion I would add to the way the restaurant is laid out is for the management to consider creating walls to make the seating area a little less cavernous and open.  There needs to be a way to break up that huge, open feeling and make it cozy.  Anyway, I digress.  We were served by a young man named Eddie and he was the BEST server that I have had in years, possibly ever.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and super attentive, but not 'in our faces' and annoying. He is as well trained to what a 'good server' needs to do (and when) as the highest paid server in the most high falutin' restaurant in all of Fancy Land!!  Kudos to such an outstanding example of what a server should do, the management needs to reward him for being so awesometastic.  Okay, the food was ah-maaaaazing.  Now I was like the other reviewer who said they only had so-so expectations for the food, because it is a theme place and to be honest, you are *really* going for the experience in a theme place...kinda like how a certain unnamed HUGE Mexican themed restaurant in Denver was caught serving Alpo dog food (years ago) yet people still ate it and came there.  Yuck. They came for the experience, not the top notch food.    Man was I wrong about Monsterland; DEAD wrong.  The food was outstanding; I mean it.    We started our dinner with appetizers.  We got a Children of the Corn fritters, and a Casket of Chips.  Both were delicious.  The fritters were a pillowy light, hot fried fritter with of sweet potato and corn deliciousness.  And the Casket of Chips was a delicious, hot pile of homemade potato chips smothered with an assortment of yumminess; it was kinda dark so I couldn't see what the toppings were, just that my tongue was happy, and it was drizzled with a intriguing creamy sauce that we couldn't identify, but loved nevertheless.  I had a Swamp water cocktail and it was utterly fantastic.  It was a intoxicating blend of coconut, pineapple and rum all swirled together in a pretty blue potion that went down FAR too easily.     My entree was The Stake and it was fabulous.  The meat was oh-so tender and seasoned perfectly, and it had the PERFECT side-fat sear.  Ohmidog, so good; I swear to you, it is 8:30 in the morning and I am already wishing I could be eating another Stake right now!  It was served with roasted, seasoned veggies and I was pleased to see that they even included sweet potatoes in the roasted veggies.  You don't see that too often, they usually throw together a few yellow and green squash and maybe carrots, but not here, they went the extra vegetable-mile.  My younger brother and husband both had a Flying Saucer pizza on a herbed foccacia bread crust; I tasted it and it was delicious!  The cheese was gooey, melty deliciousness, the tomatoes slices were sweet and tender and the bread was perfectly seasoned and soft.  YUM-O!  My older brother had the HUGE Monsterland Burger and I didn't hear ANY complaints from him.  It's hard to talk when your mouth is crammed full of delicious burger...  We all shared a Gooey Eyeball creme brulee, and a coffee flavored Panna Cotta (forgot its spooky name ) for dessert and both were delicious.  My one teeny, tiny draw back was that the creme brulee was a little too dense for my tastes, but it still tasted wonderful.  Our server brought us some boxes to take what we couldn't finish and he gave us each a discount card for 15% off on future visits on wed & thurs..  (SCORE!!)    I'll add that when I got home my teenage daughter 'gleeped' my leftover steak and veggies as soon as I walked in, and she raved and raved about how yummy it was.  In fact, a couple of days ago she asked me to run over to Monsterland and pick her up a Stake.  I patiently explained to her that we live in downtown Phoenix and Monsterland is in downtown Mesa and there was NFW I was driving clear across town to get her a Stake at 9 PM at night.  (Now I may drive clear across town to get ME a Monsterland Stake... *wink* )   At some point I used the ladies room and it was spotless.  You could probably eat off the floor (Although I STILL wouldn't recommend it; figure of speech and all.)  I love this place.  I am picky as hell, I really am.  I love it here.  I want to go back RIGHT NOW.  Tomorrow is my birthday, I think I better warn my husband now where he's taking me for dinner tomorrow night...    *drool*  PS: This place *may* be too scary for some wee kids.  My 6 year old son would probably crap his Wonderoos and then run screaming for his tiny life.

Monsterland you make me sad and confused...  I called here on October 3rd about 1 PM to inquire about bringing 25 +/- of my software engineers here for lunch.  I was prepared to spend several hundred dollars on my corporate credit card to give my staff a nice pre-Halloween lunch.  I love this place and I love showing it off to new people.  Well, the phone rang and rang and rang and finally went to a voicemail that was full so I couldn't leave a message.  (WTF?  Nobody is answering the phone or checking the voicemails?)  So I got on their website and sent an email to the restaurant's 'contact us' email address asking if someone could please call me so I could make a reservation.  A few minutes later I got an email from an employee named Kristy Smith in Marketing who said that they were booked solid for parties for the WHOLE ENTIRE MONTH of October.    Call me a bit of skeptic, but how can a restaurant that is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays be booked solid for five days a week from 11 AM to close for the ENTIRE month of October?  I can definitely imagine that they're busy as all get out right now, but booked completely solid for a whole month?  Really?    To be fair she did say we could try to come and just squeeze in wherever we could be seated, but I'm of the mind that if you can find a way to fit 25 extra people in here or there, you can *probably* also find a way to push those tables and seats together into a group with little effort.  Being the person paying the check, it makes sense to want your group together, not shotgun blasted across the restaurant.  Otherwise it's just a confusing mess with a potentialy messed up check, and there is no group interaction...  So I replied and asked her if she meant booked solid for lunches, or dinners, or both?  And she replied that they were booked solid for BOTH.    O_o    Wow, seriously???  That's GREAT news for you guys!!!    Maybe seeing as how popular Monsterland is becoming (thanks in all part to Yelpers like me who extol the virtues of this restaurant to almost anyone who'll listen) you guys should (at least though the whole month of October) open an hour early, or maybe even consider being open 7 days a week this month, so you can accommodate all the extra business that wants to give you several hundred dollars at a time?  This is THE month that people are most likely looking for spooky dining, so I would think this is the best time to maximize your profit potential, no?  I was really, really looking forward to treating my staff to a fun, Halloween lunch and I foolishly even told them I would try to set it up this month before Halloween...  Now I feel like a weenie because I already got their hopes up and now I have to tell them that it isn't gonna happen after all.  Wonderful...   Monsterland, I really, TRULY am thrilled that you guys are getting more and more popular, but it sucks (like a starving vampire) that a huge fan like myself can't bring you 25 potential new fans AND spend a big old wad of money in your establishment this month.  :(

Came here the other day and got my bits waxed; dolphin smooth.  OMG...So nice.  My waxer, Bridget, was really cool and kept my mind off of the awkwardness of the process in general.    They use hard wax here and I'm not 100% sure I'm a hard wax fan *yet* but I'm sure it'll grow on me in time. At least it better, I bought a 6 wax, pre-paid package!  Oh, and the free panties after the waxing was the neatest thing ever!  (I mean these are seriously cute panties, not like the ugly, plain cotton, undersized free panties that Victoria's Secret sends you a coupon for occasionally.... These are EVEN CUTER than those!)  Like satin and lace, thongs and bikinis!  And yes, they even have plain cotton panties too.  What a neat after-waxing reward!  :)

Their banana tsoynami is amazing.  Seriously, I'm not 100% sure if there is crack in the banana tsoynami (is crack vegan?) but it's that addictive!    It's a little bit pricey, but who cares?!?  Yum!!

I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan (my husband is though), but their food is delicious and flavorful and a nice change of pace.  It can be a bit pricey, but I've discovered that if my husband and I each get a bowl and cups of lemonade we can keep it to about $20, which makes it much more wallet friendly for an impromptu weeknight dinner out.  Their curry bowl with fried tofu and noodles is one of my favorites, it's spicy, flavorful and piping hot.  Also their buffalo 'chicken' wings are fantastic, and very 'meaty' and spicy!   Tip: Avoid the pre-bottled sodas and drinks in the case, they are SILLY expensive.  Just get one of the cups for an in-house beverage (tea, lemonade, etc.) from the dispenser on the counter, they are very yummy and refillable.

I came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, after we left a different bar and grill where we witnessed two drunk patrons sloppily making out and dry humping each other on the outdoor patio furniture in the smoking area as we were walking up.  (Talk about a huge red flag about the standards of a place.)  Anyway, while were there drinking our ONE drink and plotting a quick escape we looked up on Yelp for a suitable replacement bar and grill and found this little gem just a few miles away.  What a huge difference!  Thank Glob we left that den of iniquity and headed over here.  We shared an order of Stuffed Green Chilies ($9) and their Southwest Chicken Ramen ($10.59) and both dishes were not only a nice break from the traditional bar fare, but also very tasty.  He had a beer and commented that he was pleased to see how many taps they had at the bar and I departed from my traditional margarita and had a Bloody Mary, which wasn't bad.  Our server was prompt and friendly and we had zero complaints about anything here.  We will definitely be returning here!!

How hard is it to get a 2 donut order right??    One chocolate glazed and one strawberry glazed donut.  That's IT.   Apparently pretty hard.

Yeah, this wasn't the highlight of my recent outings with my kids.  There was so much wrong that I'll just try to sum it up.    Firstly, I came here with my neighbor and husband and all our collective kids.  We arrived as they opened and we parked in the parking area right in front of the SkyPark.   And despite that when we left we discovered that we got a warning in the form of a parking map on our car window implying that we weren't supposed to park there if we were attending the church next door; what the heck??    We went in and I had to sign a waiver that basically said that if my kids kill themselves here on a broken spring, torn fabric, etc. even if it's clearly the fault or failure of SkyPark, that I won't hold them liable for anything, ever, period.  In fact, I'm fairly sure that if one of their employees had snapped and whipped out a machine gun and killed everyone I would have also signed away my rights to legal recourse for that event too.   It definitely not a litigious type, but when the establishment is going out of their way to say no matter how badly screwed up our equipment is, if something happens with our haphazard, poorly maintained equipment it's not on them I get very suspicious and it makes me hyper vigilant about everything.  Indeed I saw reason to be hyper vigilant too.  There was evidence that this place is poorly maintained and struggling, badly.  I saw torn spring guards, ripped trampolines, AC units dripping condensation into 55 gallon trash cans, caution tape draped across whole sections that were off limits, and evidence of general deferred maintenance everywhere.    I directed my kids to the least threating looking area: a foam pit in the back corner, and made a mental note not to come back here.  Then the kids announced they were hungry so I ventured to the almost bare concession stand in the back and asked about the pizza for $14 they advertised on the marquee above the concession stand.  The bored employee texting on his cell phone looked up long enough to tell me that I needed to just call Mama Mia Pizza in the shopping center and order one since that's where they order their pizzas from anyway.  Confused, I confirmed with him that the process to order a pizza for my family though the SkyPark concession stand was just to call Mamma Mia Pizza and order it myself?  Yep.  That's correct.   Okay, so I'll call Mamma Mia Pizza....  (Review continued at Mamma Mia Pizza)

I'm a big fan of the Brass Armadillo up on I-17 and for a long time I've wanted to check out this newer Brass Armadillo.  I wasn't disappointed.  It is just as big as the other Brass Armadillo and has about the same amount of merchandise ranging in price from extremely reasonable to "Ha, Ha, are they nuts?"    They have numerous booths with treasures ranging from antique toys, vinyl records, house wares, furniture, vintage clothing, and so forth.  I saw a few things I really liked, and if I had a bigger budget I would've bought them, but being on a financial diet I placated my primal urge to spend money and just bought a $5 set of pin up doll playing cards for my husband.   (Lucky dude.)  I will say that my general impression between the two stores is that the older Brass Armadillo on I-17 has a healthier inventory of antique furniture, but aside from that, the two are practically indistinguishable, so unless you are looking for furniture, if you live closer to this one then save yourself the drive to the other one.     PS:  Can I just add that the vendors who are selling couches and chairs who have a 'Do Not Sit' sign on the chair/couch need to rethink that since there is NFW that most people would by a chair or a couch that they couldn't at least sit on and test out in the store.  I mean seriously, either you are selling a functional (albeit antique) chair, OR you are selling a piece of broken furniture with collapsed springs, and you just don't want anyone to find out until after they've paid for it.  Which is it?

I hate writing bad reviews so I'm gonna touch on the positive before I touch on the negative.  The positives:  The restaurant is lovely, and nicely decorated.  We sat on the patio and it was also very pleasant out there too.  The cinnamon roll that my best friend got was delicious; soft, yeasty and just the right amount of frosting too; very well made.  The peach mimosas were fabulous, although at $7 each I thought they were too pricey.  The staff is gracious and accommodating, although perhaps not extremely attentive.  The negatives:  Since we had others joining us we were coming in three stages and the waiter knew that, but after our last diner arrived we sat there for several minutes waiting for our waiter to show back up and take our orders, but he had vanished so we finally had to flag down a busboy and ask for our waiter to return.  I ordered the pulled pork scramble for about $11 and it was sweet.  SWEET!  What the what??!  I picked at it trying to find a delicious, salty forkful of meaty pulled pork that *didn't* taste like it'd been slow roasted in pancake syrup and I couldn't find one edible bite.  I'm sorry, but sweet pork scrambled with eggs and cheese actually is a dismal combination.    The unsalted, rosemary roasted breakfast potatoes that came with my pork and scrambled eggs somehow managed to lack any zip or zing too.  I ate one bite of the potatoes and gave up.   This was also served with two flour tortillas which were soft and warm, but otherwise nondescript.  There was nothing of note on my whole plate and the pork and eggs was practically inedible in my opinion.  I sent my food back with about 4 bites taken out of it and sadly, the waiter didn't even think to question why I was basically sending a full plate of food back to the kitchen    Coffee is $2.25 and about as nondescript as coffee can be.  I mean seriously, it tasted like .50 a cup coffee, except it wasn't, it was $2.25.  Oh well...  So in retrospect, I paid about $26 for a breakfast that consisted of about 5 bites of food from my own plate, a cup of coffee, a mimosa and a bite of my friend's cinnamon roll.  Yep, I won't be back.

I thought long and hard last night about writing this review, decided today after looking at my car again that I needed to.  I came here yesterday for an oil change.  The price was $74.99 for a Mobile One oil change, and the attendant informed me that *of course* MY car would take a couple of extra quarts at almost $11.00 a quart and an oil filter isn't included in an oil change...that's $3.00 more.  So my out the door price was $112.97 after taxes.  That includes a car wash though, reasonable, right??  :/  So I come back an hour later and sit with the waiting patrons outside for my car to be finished.  Finally a Hispanic woman motions that my car is done, I come over, thank her and slip a $5 to her as a gratuity and strap my child in her car seat.  I jump in my seat and prepare to close the door and that's when I see it...the tweeter speaker for the driver's side door has been broken off and is dangling limply by the speaker wire!  (If I hadn't noticed this and pulled the door shut I would gave crushed it in the door hinges.)  So I call over an employee and point it out, all the while wondering why THEY didn't tell me when they handed my car back to me a few seconds ago?  A member of management arrives and says he will try to go fix it, so he takes the car to the back, and literally the ONLY instructions I gave him as he left was "Whatever you do to fix it make sure it doesn't come out looking ghetto."  Half and hour later a gentleman introduced himself as an owner and bought my daughter a Slurpee (that was very nice) and asked if my experience was good, and I told him what was going on...  He was shocked and walked me back to the service bay to see what was going on with my car.  This was where I was asked by someone "How long have you had this car?  Because someone tried to fix this before."  The answer is about a year.  But it shouldn't really matter if I bought it right off the assembly line or a day ago.  My speaker was in place and intact when I drove in here and shouldn't have been broken off, or 're-broken' according to you guys.  That's diverting responsibility for what just happened TODAY.  So as the owner left me with the repair techs on the service bay he told them "Make her happy."  Well, turns out they couldn't fix it, and that one, simple request I had of the first employee about not making any repair look ghetto???  They smeared milky white super glue all over my black speaker and rubber door trim in a botched attempt to reattach it!  It looks WORSE!    The instructions to me as I left was just to go online buy a new one and come back and they'd attach it.  They were certain new ones were only about $15 each.  We'll I checked, they are $38 before shipping and at this point I think Francis and Sons should buy me one and call me to come over there when they can replace it.    (Also, maybe talk to your car wash employees about being upfront with customers when they accidentally break stuff so problems like this can be handled professionally instead of discovered by an irate customer...?)

Well, these jackasses have since changed their name AND nobody from management ever contacted me to make this right either.    I ended up ordering a new tweeter speaker from a Volvo parts supply place and replacing it on my own, the tweeter speaker was just under $100 after shipping because I opted to get one that was a complete speaker, not just the plastic cover.  I did this after reading up and realizing that I would have to melt the tweeter speaker off of my old speaker cover and affix it and all the wiring to my new speaker cover.  (That's beyond my technical skillset.)  Oh, and all the fucking superglue that the hamfisted employee smeared all over my door frame and rubber door gasket in his horribly botched attempt to fix it?  I wasn't really able to get tall of that off, even with acetone, so thanks for the permanent super glue damage to my car.  It took me about an hour to figure out how to affix the new speaker and to razor scrape as much superglue as I could off of the car's surfaces and it still looks bad.  I'm furious.

We went here for a toddler-level 'hike' this weekend and I can't believe that in all my life of living in the Valley I haven't stopped here to enjoy this park.  I'm almost embarrassed to admit that!  In my defense, I have hiked up to Governor Hunt's white pyramid tomb that overlooks the Phoenix Zoo, which I *think* is still technically park of Papago Park...no?  But this time I was on the side of the park with the buttes and I've definitely never been on this side of the park before.  It was very pleasant and the brisk weather was great for outdoor exercise, and ensuring no snakes.  That no snakes thing is a BIG plus in my book.    The paved trails all seemed well maintained and stroller friendly.  The unpaved trails were even perfect for my large wheeled, jogging stroller, but no bueno for some tiny wheeled, umbrella stroller.  The sole picnic ramada area I saw at the base of the buttes was very large and well kept too.    I liked how clean the park was and how you can experience a very basic outdoor hike while still being in the city with a full cell signal.  In fact I saw someone rappelling down the side of the one of the buttes and numerous people enjoying the cool weather on the bikes; it's nice that people can do that right in the center of the Valley. All in all, it made it the perfect place to take my baby daughter for her first little 'hike' so she could wander around and pick up rocks and see the view of Phoenix, but if needed we were a mere 20 minutes from home.    The only complaint was that I didn't see any public restrooms at the entrance to the trail by the parking lot, just a water fountain.  By the time we were leaving all that water I drank back there on the trail had gone right though me, and I would have even welcomed a smelly porta-potty.   Oh, and I saw that some oatmeal brain had carefully bagged their dog's crap and then left the little bag of dog crap laying on the ground by the trailhead.  This was the ONLY litter I saw, by the way.   This begs the question of the person that left it, why even bag your dog's crap if you aren't then gonna throw it away in the trashcan a staggering 50 feet away??  Are you attempting to preserve the poop from disintegrating and decomposing in the natural elements by leaving it in that little baggie for all of posterity?    Or perhaps you have a butler that follows you around and picks up the little baggies of poop that you leave everywhere?    THAT must be it.  You are a lucky person to have such a clean up service...  Idiot.

I love WinCo.  The store is enormous, spotlessly clean, the prices are extremely low, the selection is amazing.  Their produce, meat, dairy and bakery sections are wonderful, and the final (huge) plus is that the staff is genuinely friendly and extremely outgoing.  Another interesting thing about WinCo is their huge bulk food section and food storage area.  Perfect for those of us that like to have a few things in deep storage...just in case of a zombie invasion.  The only thing I don't like about WinCo is that there isn't one nearer to the center of Phoenix.  I have to drive clear up to Bell Road and 7th Avenue to get to it and that is pretty far.  But let me assure you, it IS totally worth the drive!!    Now, I see that some folks are saying in their reviews that WinCo doesn't accept debit cards: THIS IS FALSE.  I just used my debit card here this last weekend...  CLARIFICATION FOR THOSE THAT ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE PAYMENT POLICY: They do NOT accept credit cards.  They *DO* accept debit cards.    Easy tip to tell the difference between the two different kinds of cards:   -If you sign for your purchase it is CREDIT. -If you enter a pin number it is DEBIT.     The more you know...

I came here again for groceries with my teenage daughter this weekend since I received a $10 off of a $50 purchase coupon in the mail.  (Yes!)  It's a bit of a drive for me to get up here since I live nearer downtown Phoenix, but I think it's worth the drive if I go once a month or so.  Firstly, I'll begin this review with perhaps my ONLY criticism of the store and that is that there isn't an apparent plastic bag recycling box at the front of the store like there are at so many other grocery stores.  I just assumed there would be one and was caught off guard when I walked up there with my used bags and I couldn't find one.  Oh well...    So, anyway I was once again, dazzled by the enormous selection of various goods.  Their selection in each department (including bulk goods) is so big that it's like a grocery store on steroids. And once again the prices were fabulous.  Also, a new thing for me this time was the presence of some very friendly employees stationed around the store offering samples of the different goods that the store had on sale that day.  My daughter and I sampled their whole wheat French bread and a garlic butter spread, a new type of cold cereal from Post, some toasted flat bread, some crab cakes, and finally some Progresso brand clam chowder.   It was nice.    The checkout process was efficient and the cashier was friendly and fast.  He applied my $10 off of $50 coupon, then he asked me how many of my own bags I had brought so that he could credit my grocery bill for it.  I don't know exactly how much credit you get for each reusable bag, but it's still awesome.  My daughter bagged our groceries and before I knew it we were ready to leave.  (And you say child labor like it's a bad thing...)    We got out of there with a cart STUFFED to the brim with fresh produce, tons of meat, four gallons of milk and a dozen yogurts, several loaves of bread, plus a bunch of name brand grocery items (including two big bags of cat and dog food) for just about $120.  In comparison, I estimate I would have spent about $150 for all that food at a competing grocery store.   Score!

What a beautiful, sexy restaurant!  I came here on Friday night with my three dear friends for a much needed, relaxing dinner out.  We decided to use the 20% Yelp discount voucher I received the night before at the Summer Splash and Dash event, and as soon as we were seated I gave our waiter, Chris, my Yelp discount card.  We ordered drinks and I was a little overwhelmed by the large cocktail menu.  Not overwhelmed in a bad way, but overwhelmed in a good way...it was enormous!  My friends all ordered their own drinks and we placed an appetizer orders: the "endless" caramel popcorn with Ancho chilies, and half orders each of the tater tots and the seasoned Kennebec French fries.  The tater tots and fries were both hot and delicious and came with tangy dipping sauce.  The caramel popcorn was intriguing with its slightly spicy end note.  We really enjoyed the popcorn, but sadly while the menu description implied it was a refillable menu item, it wasn't refilled when we depleted the bowl and so we only got a very small serving.  After finishing our first cocktails we all placed our dinner orders, I ordered the large order of the Kobe beef short ribs with the blue cheese grits, my girlfriends both ordered flatbread pizzas and a salad and our lone male companion ordered the lamb meatballs.  We also ordered additional cocktails to go with dinner and I took the chance to order a drink the waiter recommended called a Bermuda Triangle, which was cold, fruity, tangy and massively potent too.  (Wow!)  Our dinners all trickled out at different times and us three ladies at the table had all been served for a full 15 minutes before we eventually grabbed the closest waiter in the vicinity, Justin, and had him check on our companion's missing lamb meatballs.  Justin happily obliged our request and disappeared into the kitchen only to reappear with the lamb meatballs in less than 30 seconds.  How long they were sitting there waiting to be delivered to our table was anyone's guess.  Sadly our own waiter wasn't aware of this hitch because he never came near our table that whole time.  I knew there was a problem though when the people who came in a full 30 minutes after we were seated had been served their food (including an order of lamb meatballs) and the three of us ladies had all been served and our friend was still waiting for his entree!  After everyone finally had their food we all started to eat and I wasn't at all disappointed with my Kobe beef ribs!  They were so generously sized I could only eat one, however the grits were utterly unremarkable and I basically ignored them in favor of that massive, meaty rib.  I also tasted the lamb meatballs and they were fabulous, although the hot pink sour cream they were served with was a bit oddly colored.  Not long after we finished eating our waiter reappeared and he volunteered to clear our table and package the second, untouched Kobe beef rib for me.  We also placed dessert orders and chatted while we waited for dessert to appear.  Oddly our desserts, including my Panna Cotta and my friend's seasonable sorbets, were all served with forks.  I had to ask the waiter for spoon instead.  My Panna Cotta was a tad too soft for my liking, but the pool of foamy citrus sauce it was sitting in was very good and deliciously tangy, although to be quite honest I could have done without the flavorless, unidentifiable curls that topped the Panna Cotta.  Seriously, I couldn't even identify what they were, they were that tasteless.  We paid our tab and tipped our waiter on the pre-discount amount.  (It should be noted that we would have tipped him more, but leaving us to sit for 15 minutes as our dinners cooled and we politely waited for our companion's missing dinner entree was no bueno!)  So all in all this was a pleasant dining experience and I expect will venture back soon, but next time I'd love to have more follow up from our waiter and I'd hope that all the entrees all arrive around the same time too.

Rob is a carpet cleaning monster!!  He showed up to clean the 4,000 square feet of carpeting at my office at noon on Christmas Eve Eve (23rd) and he worked like a machine until the old, faded carpet looked brand spanking new!  It was hours and hours of hard work and he did it efficiently and with a smile!  The sludge that he pulled out of our office carpets was easily the most distressing thing I've seen in along time.  So gross!!  Rob left me with a bottle of cleaning solution for touch ups and even gave me a bottle of solution for the occasional accidents my two cats have at home too!  (Thank you!)  Later he called me to follow up on my satisfaction and offered to come back if anything wasn't perfect.  The price was absolutely reasonable and he didn't try any silly pricing games with me either.  I knew the price per square foot going in and the price stayed that way when I went to pay.    How many carpet cleaners can you say the same about?  That's what I thought...  If you need your carpets cleaned, I mean REALLY cleaned, not just kinda cleaned and you don't want any BS pricing games then you have to call Rob.  In fact, I plan on scheduling him to come clean my house carpets as soon as I finish some home improvement projects.  See you soon, Rob!

Had Rob clean the carpets at my house a few weeks ago; he did a stellar job and the carpets were spotless and beautiful afterwards!  Naturally my 2 kids immediately took this as a challenge to dirty them again as quickly as possible.  But that's besides the point.

Excellent work, and attention to detail.  They landscaped my entire yard from the boring builder landscaping that came with my house in the front yard; a kidney bean shaped piece of grass a couple of tiny trees and some rocks.  And they also took my dirt backyard and turned it into a tropical oasis, with a beautiful rock waterfall, flowering plants, trees, lush grass and pavers done in a cool circular pattern.  It's beautiful back there now and all my friends are insanely jealous of my mini tropical paradise.    I highly recommend them.  I'm taking off one star because my project was delayed by a 3 days because of a 3 day holiday weekend, but I guess that means that they actually give their employees holiday weekends off...so maybe that should actually be plus one star?  EDITED: After thinking about it for a few weeks, I decided to give back the star I originally subtracted for the 1 day delay on my project.  I decided it was pretty unreasonable for me to subtract a star over that.  Anyway, I would highly recommend them.  Excellent attention to detail and beautiful work!

So, working right down the street from this place I've been eyeballing it for weeks, waiting for a good time to strike...  Well, that time finally came and I stopped in here for a pre-holiday lunch just a few weeks ago.  I have to brag on them, the food is utterly delicious!  I ordered the Buffalo Chicken crepe for lunch, and a First Timer (Nutella with bananas) crepe for dessert.    (Yes, dessert with lunch.  It was almost Christmas and I was treating myself...  Don't judge!)    Firstly, let me say that the buffalo chicken crepe was light and airy while the chicken was spicy and savory.  It was complemented by julienned carrots and crumbled blue cheese, which perfected it.  The First Timer dessert crepe was like a warm hazelnut and chocolate banana party wrapped in a pillowy soft crepe; amazingly good.  Second, while it all tasted fabulous, the food *was* a bit on the high price for a lunch entree, especially considering that the crepes don't come with any kind of side so really all you get for your money is a delicious crepe.  Also it was a little bit slow in coming out, but still so yummy that I'll easily forgive the wait.  (Plus, as another reviewer perfectly stated, "It's not as though they are looking to dethrone McDonald's" so keep that in mind when you are waiting for your food...  Quality takes time, right?)  I edited this to add that as far as pricing goes a miniature, mixed green salad served as a side with the savory crepes (with a simple lemon and olive oil dressing) would easily make me feel the value for the price had been leveled out and would cost very little to provide.    I don't know if my waistline or my wallet can handle visiting the Crepe Bar too frequently, but I'll definitely make it a point to come by as often as the diet and the budget will allow it!

I came here for dessert after dinner at Hula's Modern Tiki (right across the parking lot) with my closest friends a couple of weeks ago.  It was super cozy and the guy they had working the register was friendly and very cool.  He even offered to snap a group photo of us in between helping his other customers.    We all got a serving of frozen yogurt and my best friend in the whole world said that mine looked like a toddler made it because I covered it in gummy bears, Cap'n Crunch cereal, candied sunflower seeds, and frosted Circus Animal cookies.   On the other hand she made a 'dignified', grownup mixture of chocolate chips, coconut and chopped nuts.    It is my belief that youth is wasted on the young, so in that vein I refuse to grow up...    Besides: gummy bears!!!!!    (FYI-I said that in the voice of 'Steve' the thought-translated monkey in 'Spaghetti with a Chance of Meatballs'!)

I came here on a whirlwind tour of Valley secondhand stores on Saturday.  It was a fun day; we stayed out of the rain (while still enjoying the drizzle), we got some really neat items, and we spent very little money in the process.  My husband, our baby girl and I stopped in here as we were headed home and I'm really glad we did.    While this Goodwill was also running a 50% off everything promotion, it was still well stocked with a respectable selection of merchandise and the employees were all working furiously to keep the aisles clear, and the shelves organized and re-stocked.    I was also able to score a BRAND NEW Vick's humidifier and a picture frame for under $5, out the door.  This wouldn't seem like a great find normally, but I had needed a new hot steam humidifier, and I always feel ripped off for paying about $20 for one at Walgreen's.  And the picture frame was a really fortuitous find because I just happened to need a picture frame that had four, vertical, 4x6 photo openings and a mat, all without any silly phrases (FAMILY, Sister=Best Friend, I luv my dogs, that kind of crap) painted on the frame itself.  Do you know how hard it is to find a frame like that, that meets those requirements? Pretty darned hard.  In fact, right before Christmas I spent about an hour online looking for just that kind of 4x6 frame and the only thing I found that was even remotely close was about $52 and the color was all wrong.  This was a very lucky find all for $2.  YAY!  Anyway, I had a good experience here.  It was one of the better ones.  PS:  They had a huge sofa sized painting of an overly dramatic starkly feminine face that looked almost like Pete Burns (from Dead or Alive) in full drag makeup.  It was utterly fabulous, and if I'd been in the mood for an 80's rock icon sofa painting, that sucker would have been MINE!  In fact, it might still be there.  HURRY!

I came here last Saturday with my best friend for a post Junior League rummage sale breakfast and we were impressed.    The décor is cute, you feel almost like you are in someones home, even if the traffic flow and set up the restaurant is somewhat perplexing at first.  Soon enough we figured out where and how to order.    For other first timers, apparently you grab a menu at the end of the line that runs right in front of the open kitchen, you chose what you want while in line and then place your order and pay at the end of the line.  Not a bad set up as it allows you to see right into the cooking stations and watch the chefs in action (which is both neat and reassuring at the same time) but, when you get to the end of the line and pay that is where you are expected to also add your gratuity, and I just don't like the idea of having to pay gratuity on a meal before I've even been served or tasted the food.    Am I the only one that feels that way?  I think setting it up like that almost encourages patrons to hold back on the gratuity because we have to bet on the law of averages and assume that the service will be mid-grade so that we're not over tipping and if the service was great the server loses because lots of people don't carry cash.  I'm definitely not gonna swipe my debit card again simply to pay an additional gratuity.  Tipping at the end of the meal represents a better snapshot of how the diners experience really was.  Okay, getting off my soapbox now...  So, I ordered the Mexican Benedict and it was very good; spicy, savory and filling.  The poached egg was laid atop a perfectly flavorful bed of chorizo and smothered in delicious Hollandaise sauce.  Sadly I didn't detect any tomato or cilantro in mine.  Perhaps it was cooked into the chorizo and that's why I couldn't taste it?  That's okay though.  Honestly, the only aspect of the meal I didn't like was the dense, cold sopes that the eggs were perched atop of; they were hard, flavorless and cold.  While I understand wanting to keep with the Mexican theme, I still think that an English muffin (or anything else) would have been a better option here.  Or maybe just heat up the sopes first, so that they're hot and soft?  My best friend ordered the Pain Perdue with whiskey caramel sauce.  Oh, dear sweet, 6 lb, 7 oz. baby Jesus, it was SO GOOD.  It had the perfect texture and sponginess and spice.  You could really taste the bananas and the whiskey sauce was the perfect complement to the French toast; amazing.  It was served with two pieces of breakfast meat (she chose bacon) and the bacon was just so-so.  Not really brilliant or detracting, just your average piece of bacon.    She had a caramel latte and I had a plain cup of coffee, she loved her coffee and I thought mine was just okay.  Again just average coffee.  Decent, but not exotic in any way.  The service was very good and we were brought our food within just a few minutes of taking our number and having a seat.  About halfway through our meal we were checked on to make sure we were doing well, we were, and then we spent the rest of the meal enjoying the food and the décor and making silent comments about the eclectic assortment of guests around us.  (When you've been best friends for over 25 years, you learn to have whole conversations with just a look.)     So while I did mention a couple of things that I thought could be improved upon (the cold sopes and the advance gratuity being the most important issues) I still had a great visit, and it was a nice breakfast out for both of us.  We will definitely be back.

Until last week I had no idea what a Gelati was.  I saw it mentioned in a few Yelp reviews, understood it to be a hybrid Italian ice meets frozen custard and was sold on the idea.  Then I noticed that I work just a couple of miles from here and I knew a Gelati was in my imminent future.  Well it happened, a mere two days after hearing about the mythological creature known as a Gelati I found myself driving over to Rita's and ordering one.  It was magnificent, but I'm getting ahead of myself and skipping over the fabulous favor offerings that you can combine in your Gelati...  First off you pick the type of frozen custard you want.  I saw vanilla and chocolate and I think there were other flavors too, probably lowfat ones...?  Plain old vanilla is my game.  (I like a simple and classic base flavor if I'm about to 'get funky' with the rest of my frozen treat, you know what I mean?)  Next you pick either one or two Italian Ice flavors to 'sandwich' the serving of frozen custard in the middle.  The Italian Ice favors varied from strawberry, mango, pineapple, cotton candy, and I think I even saw a marshmallow one too.  These Italian Ices are indeed as fresh and tasty as they sound.  I know this because I tried a couple of them...delicious!  I ended up choosing strawberry and pineapple as my Italian Ice combination.  There were real pieces of strawberry blended into the Italian Ice, it was stupendous!  The frozen custard tasted like someone had taken the creamy custard base of a creme brulee and churned it into frozen silken cream...  The silky, velvety creaminess of the frozen custard blended with the tangy, fruity zing of the Italian Ice was a magical combination was a thing of beauty.  PS: I think they mix up the Italian Ice offerings a bit, so the flavors you may see when you go will probably be different from the ones I saw.  And you WILL go, trust me...  ;)

Holy crap, that was good.  Had dinner here last night after a super fun time across the street playing video games, and we left duly impressed.    I had the seasonal Summer Salad with assorted greens, candied pepitas, feta, mango, strawberries, red onions and side of grilled chicken (extra), and my better half had the smoky beef tacos with a side of refried beans and freshly made chicharrónes, which he sweetly split with me.  Our food was fantastic, our server was friendly and efficient and the price was fair.  We will be back...soon.

The ordering process is a bit confusing and when we told them it was our very first visit and we needed help knowing the order process they still didn't make it very clear what all the options were.  Oh well, we eventually sorted it out.  And the other reviewer said that the menu board is poorly placed was SPOT ON.  As it is you have to stand back several feet to read it and then walk up to the counter to order.  It's awkward because right after you walk in the employees are asking you if they can help you, but if you are a 'first timer' then you are probably still standing 10 feet away looking straight upwards trying to decipher the menu and options.  It makes everything seem rushed and confusing.  I ordered the tortilla soup and it was lukewarm as soon as took one spoonful of it.  I had to go straight back and ask the cashier to please have someone put it in the oven and heat it up, and afterwards it was delivered back to our table by a sullen employee who seemed offended that I asked them to heat up my room temperature soup.  No apologies, nothing.  (Seriously, I don't think the flame was even on under the soup pan on their stove, it was that chilled.)    My husband's food looked better and was piping hot because they actually put it into their wood brick oven before he got it.  He liked his food a lot, I did NOT like mine at all.  To be completely honest, even if my soup had been served at a normal temperature it was bland, with very little definition or texture (aside from mush) and almost no zip.    We both LOVED their chips and salsa though.  Delicious!  Well probably be back to try them one more time as I really want these guys to succeed because I live right down the street and I love their concept, but if I get another room temperature bowl of soup it'll definitely be a MAJOR issue.

Holy salty food, Batman!  0_o  I had dinner here on Friday with my husband and toddler daughter.  It was packed, but not nearly as packed as the other restaurant that we attempted to visit and left because there wasn't enough space for us.  We waited in line for a few minutes and finally it was our turn to order.  I shouted my order to the employee on the other side of the counter; over the deafening din of other people who were talking and eating and all the kitchen noise.  It's very noisy when that place it busy!   I ordered 2 enchiladas with the 50/50 flour/corn tortillas and the short rib for the filling.  I chose green enchilada sauce and cheddar cheese as my topping with some Pico de Gallo and buttermilk dressing.  For my little I got her a carnita taco with a side order of the sautéed spinach and mushrooms and some of the same buttermilk dressing on her taco.  My husband ordered two enchiladas: one was spinach and mushroom filling and the other a cornbread filling.  He had the red sauce on his enchiladas.   At the register I added on a grapefruit margarita and a fountain drink for my husband.   We paid around $32 for everything.  The inside was packed, so we ate on the outside patio.  The patio was also very busy and every table was taken so we could only find seating at the counter that runs along the face of the patio wall.  It was difficult to keep a toddler perched high atop the barstool so that was a bit of a challenge, but the twilight temperature outside was really perfect so some of the hassle of sitting out there was worth it.      My grapefruit margarita was very tasty, but the food is a different story.  I like salt, I use a good deal of it in my normal cooking because as a Sonoran desert dweller we need it in our systems to survive, but I can hardly remember a time where I'd been to a restaurant and the food was so over-salted that I couldn't finish eating.  That was the case on this visit, my husband complained of the same thing, despite the fact that he was eating a completely different kind of enchilada than I was!  Our toddler only picked at her food too, I suspected it was also the sheer saltiness of it.  The buttermilk dressing on my enchiladas and my daughter's taco was outrageously salty, the green enchilada sauce across my food was crazy salty, the short rib filling was heavily salted and I think there was even salt in the Pico de Gallo too.  Seriously, whoever is in the kitchen at Gadzooks NEEDS to step away from the saltshaker, the saltiness of everything overpowered the different flavors of the dishes and it was over the top.    I'll try this place one more time and if that visit goes poorly then I'm done.  This is my second try to understand what everyone else sees in this place.  :/

Beautiful store, beautiful purses.    Holy ridiculous prices, Batman!  I must be a real cheap skate, or I am just not insane because I can't, for the life of me, understand paying that much for a purse or a wallet!  Even with the 50% off coupon on the already reduced factory outlet prices I thought the prices were laughable.  There is NFW I am paying $200 for a handbag and kidding myself that I somehow got a steal of a deal.    But if you are into the $200 purse scene then THIS is the store for you!

So I was enjoying a rare shopping day without the kids last weekend and I decided to stop in here for a quick lunch to go, and I'm so glad I did.  The restaurant was spotless and orderly and I encountered the sweetest employee working the register; unfortunately I didn't get her name.  She went out of her way to make my experience pleasant and I really thought she was super cool.    I ordered the 2 piece meal with a soft roll, two sides and a drink ($6.99 +tax).  I selected fried okra and corn nuggets as my sides.  I got a half and half mixture of strawberry and grape Fanta soda from the fountain drink dispenser.  (Don't judge.)  First off I'd like to know how it is that I've been on this Earth for 40 years yet I've never had corn nuggets before?  They were amazing deep fried, batter dipped nuggets of sweet corn...  Delicious!  I'd be back for those corn nuggets ALONE, but the fried chicken, the fried okra and the roll were also phenomenal too!  Fact: the soft roll didn't even make it home with me.  I'll add that my husband, who's a part time, half-assed vegetarian, scarfed down the extra piece of fried chicken that I saved for him too.  When I got home I discovered that *somehow* my two piece order magically morphed into a 3 piece order, allowing my husband an opportunity to taste this delicious chicken too... (Thank you! *wink*)    This chicken is crunchy, spicy and perfectly cooked; it's so good it'll make a half-hearted vegetarian fall off the wagon.   Also, it's worth mentioning that they offer chicken and waffle combination plates, and some of their other sides include dirty rice, rice and gravy, macaroni and cheese and so much more.  And yeah, in case you were wondering they also have seafood gumbo, and fried fish and shrimp too.  And their desserts?  Oh Dear Sweet Lord, they have pecan pie, and sweet potato pie and banana pudding and peach cobbler and even Red Velvet Cake!    Louisiana Fried Chicken, piping hot corn nuggets and banana pudding?!  Why are you even still sitting here reading this review??  Go!  Go now!!  So seriously folks, take a look at the other reviews for this place; you have at least 5 Yelp Elite accounts giving this place high reviews, that should speak for something right there.  If you love flavorful fried chicken and you haven't stopped here yet you really should.  Also, for the owners, if possible, I'd suggest considering adding a sign down on Thomas Road advertising your presence inside the strip mall.  The current over the door marquee sign isn't very easy to see from the main road unless you are heading westbound (you can't see it heading Eastbound) on Thomas and just happen to look up to your left at the *exact right* time.     Good luck!  I'd sincerely love to see you guys succeed so I can continue to enjoy your delicious food!

I came here on Friday night with the husband and my littlest to get a post dinner treat.  First off, parking is a nightmare here on Friday nights with all of the surrounding eateries competing for the limited spaces.  I witnessed a near fist fight as some little buttwad driving a Fiat raced into a parking space that was about to be occupied by a middle aged father with his family in the car.  (The dad showed great restraint in not decking the young punk who cut him off.)    Finally my husband found us a parking space in the rear and we walked around and went inside.  The store is small but super cute with very attractive artwork hanging from the walls (and offered for sale) and light alternative music playing overhead.   We were newbies to this kind of treat so we each modestly chose a small sized, original flavor milk ice.  I had chopped strawberries and caramel glazed over the one I shared with my little, and my husband got one with sliced almonds and no glaze.  Our total was a modest $8 and the very friendly cashier offered me a punch card for future visits.   We sat at an inside table to eat and we loved our treats; they were light and sweet but not too heavy or dense.  It really was shaved ice.  I'm intrigued at the different flavors like taro and green tea and the toppings like lychee fruit, rice pudding and mochi balls, and they also had a photo of something called a brick toast, which looked pretty tasty...I'll definitely be back here at another time to check out some of the other offerings and toppings.    I'm glad I finally got over to this place to check it out!

I'm kinda sad, I went all the way over here and ordered the 8 piece fried oyster combination and I neglected to get cocktail sauce with my oysters, which would have been the pièce de résistance for my delicious, hot and crispy fried oysters!  Instead I opted for malt vinegar...stupid me!  My oysters were cooked to perfection and my sides, fried okra and buttered corn, were delicious and hot too.  The 8 piece meal was a little over $15, but it didn't come with a drink, so it's a little bit pricey if you aren't even getting a drink, but aside from the drink issue the food is a decent value and the service was friendly.    I'd also like to mention that the restaurant was scrupulously clean and my to-go meal had a couple of Dentyne mini packs of peppermint gum thrown in, which I thought was a nice touch since NOBODY wants to have post-lunch oyster breath, amiright?

Impressive!    This little place is a modestly decorated, scrupulously clean fish taco joint with a fresh toppings bar and very, very friendly employees who really go out of their way to greet you and make sure you know what the offerings are.    I liked it.  Considering it's walking distance from my office I'll be back.

Sadly, it's time to update my review...downwards.    Got lunch here today and ordered the combo #2, which consisted of a small drink, one fish taco and shrimp salad that was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  I was thinking it was side salad sized, not entrée sized.  (I also thought all of the lunch combos came with 2 tacos, not just one.  *sigh*)  As far as the food goes, the fish taco was great, but the shrimp on the salad tasted *suspicious* so I tossed the whole salad out after a couple of bites rather than risk it.  I may still regret those bites that I took.  That remains to be seen...  The whole meal set me back over $9 and really all I got to eat was one fish taco and small lemonade.  Not so much with the value, eh?

I am SO glad they opened this new Goodwill, presumably to replace that older Goodwill on the other end of the very same shopping mall.  This one is brilliant.  It's clean, well organized and bursting at the seams with good stuff.    In fact this one had no less than 6 armoires in the furniture area when I went to check it out just a few days ago.  That's a lot of armoires to choose from!    This store just opened at the beginning of April so it still has that new secondhand store smell!    Go.  Go now!!

They say ignorance is bliss, and in this case I'd like to stay blissfully ignorant about the caloric content of the bombdiggity Pineapple Upside Down Pancakes and hot, crispy Chilaquiles Benedict and hashbrowns that I had here for breakfast when I had brunch with my best friend a few weeks ago, mmmmkay?  Thanks.

NO.   This order as you walk in, pay there (including a tip) and have the food delivered to your table concept is awful and confusing and no bueno.    The food at Red Devil is delicious, I'll state that for the record.    The standing there and deciding what your whole table wanted to eat and drink as people queue up behind you and out the door idea is awful!!  And to make matters worse, since the person running the food out to the table (are they a waiter? a food deliverer??) has no idea what you ordered at the register, so when you mention that you also placed a To Go order to take to someone at home, you can expect a lot of confusion between the food deliverer, the kitchen and the person at the cash register.  What a frigging mess.  :/  I'll stick with the old fashioned sit down Red Devil restaurants, thanks.

I did it, I broke my solemn vow...  I braved the self-absorbed yuppies and the tanned and coiffed mommies in $100 Lulu Lemon yoga pants who've never broken a genuine sweat in their lives (Bikram yoga doesn't count, bitches!) and I went into Whole Foods with my husband and toddler.  Previously I'd publically vowed that I wouldn't be caught dead in there.  Well, curiosity got the best of me and not surprisingly it was packed elbow to elbow with other curious shoppers.    But OH MY GLOB, it was dazzling!!   I was drawn in by the siren song of a bakery case filled with desserts too pretty to eat and prices high enough to deter you if you decided they were pretty enough to eat after all, and a salad and prepared foods section too varied and ginormous to describe, and a seafood and meats section across one wall, beckoning us with thick cut bacon, and exotic fishes and beautiful, marbled cuts of meat.  And the cheese section?  The mind boggles.  It was all too much!  I'm not exactly a bona fide gourmand so when the very helpful employee behind the seafood counter cheerfully offered me a free sample of the prepared seaweed salad I politely accepted it and took a tiny bite, immediately regretting it and wishing there was a discreet trash can where I could spit the green, slimy, masticated glob of seaweed out of my mouth.  I gritted my teeth and swallowed.  (And yes, in case you were wondering, it was EXACTLY like that kind of a swallow.)   Finally, I spied a package of small, bakery-made, vanilla Whoopie Pies over in the bakery area.  Unhealthy, fattening and uniquely American:  It speaks my language!  In addition to the Whoopie Pies we also picked up some French cookies from the bakery, two small boxes of pasta salads from the salad/cold food bar, and a bottle of house wine on special; a sour and dry Moscato, that tasted nothing like any Moscato I've ever had and I hated it, immensely.  Our total bill was about $50 for the 5 items, and we carried out our little grocery bag with $50 worth of groceries to our car.    Looking around the parking lot it appeared that we really were out of our element sporting a pro-life bumper sticker on one side of the back window, and the thrash Rivet band; Ministry bumper sticker on the other side, in a sea of Prius' with Obama '12 bumper stickers, and Subarus with World Wildlife Foundation stickers and ski racks.  Clearly, we are NOT their signature clientele.  Would I go back?  Probably.  This is definitely the place to get that hard to come by ingredient for a special recipe.  But I'd only venture back with a bigger wad of money and healthy dose of cynicism for the image Whole Food's target demographic exudes about their 'healthy' lifestyle in mind, body and spirit.    *snorts heartily*   Oh,  and remember those Whoopie Pies I bought at this veritable mecca of health food???   They ended up being the most unhealthy, butter dripping, sugary deliciousness I've eaten since I was a carefree little kid with a stomach of iron.  In fact they were SO disgustingly delicious and fattening that I could only tolerate a sliced off quarter of one per day, otherwise I literally felt greasy and queasy.  Bravo, Whole Foods, it appears we are not so dissimilar after all!

They were friendly, the place was spotless, we were in there in a flash and out just as soon as they realized we needed to be referred to the ER.    I'd definitely suggest this urgent care if you need one!

I held a happy hour for my co-workers here last month.   The appetizers were delicious; we ordered some nachos and a plate of onion strings.  We also got the BIG Lucky Strike Combo appetizer sampler, and that could have easily served eight people.  The platter included Buffalo Wings, mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce, sliders, tortilla chips with salsa, spinach dip and a queso dip.  While we only sat and drank, the activity selection was dazzling.  I saw video games, bowling, laser tag and something they call Gravity Ropes (an elevated roper ladder type of climbing structure).  It was late afternoon so there weren't too many patrons, but everyone looked like they were having a good time.  Overall we had a good visit, my only issue to bring up was that the volume of music blasting overhead was so loud that our group had to shout at each other just to communicate, which doesn't make for a very sociable outing.  Making the music louder doesn't automatically equate to a more fun environment; the two are not directly proportionate.    I'd suggest maybe turning down the speaker volume from an 11 to a 8.

I had a really nice dinner here last night with my husband and toddler daughter and neighbor, Trystan.  Our neighbor is actually from Cornwall and he was the one who brought us here to try the regional specialty of his home turf.  Obviously, he is a regular here.    Now I had been to the Cornish Pasty location in Tempe, but it had been a few years ago, so for all intents and purposes this was my first real, sit-down visit.    They let us sit where we wanted and we chose a nice spot out on the patio and they brought us a high chair and drink.  I got a glass of the house Riesling.  (It was delicious) and our waitress brought a small pewter plate of bread slices and a small dipping cup of tomato soup for our daughter.  I thought that was really thoughtful of her.  We ordered a side of chips with a spicy bean dip for the table, and everyone enjoyed that.  I also got to taste the cup of soup that Trystan ordered, a creamy potato, leek and Stilton cheese combination.  Honestly I wished I'd ordered a whole bowl of that soup for myself!  Amazing.  I ordered the Oggie pasty and it was a thing of beauty, deliciously browned and filled with a hearty, meat and root vegetable mixture.  It came with a flavorful sauce that I *think* was a red wine reduction.  My husband got the Cottage Pie and he said he really liked it.  And apparently it was hefty enough that he had enough leftovers to take for lunch today.    By the end of dinner we didn't have any room for dessert, which means we will just have to make an effort to come back and try their delicious sounding desserts; like sticky English toffee pudding!  Keep it up guys, I really liked what I saw last night; the food, service, ambiance, everything.  Spot on!

These guys did my yard and the end result was amazing!  Fast, super professional and fairly priced; I could not be happier with my yard.  They really are in a league of their own.    Also, it's worth noting that their filtered reviews are all 5 star reviews too.  It says a lot when every review you have is 5 stars.

This is what Heaven tastes like.  I have been waiting for this place to open for weeks...waiting with baited breath...like a vulture.  Today I looked across the parking lot from my daughter's daycare and saw that a local news van was parked right in front of the donut shop; FINALLY it was open!!  I made a beeline across the parking lot and barreled into a parking spot, and in the process of bursting through the front door I *think* I might have knocked over a little old lady (unfortunate collateral damage).    The interior is beautiful and contemporary.  The staff is falling over themselves to help you chose your selections and teach you about the custom made donut creation process, and everyone is eager to make your visit perfect.  They have cafe tables inside and out, and there is even an outdoor patio in the back where you can enjoy your donuts and coffee.  So I chose 2 dozen assorted donuts for my office staff, and I just ate the most amazing strawberry shortcake donut in the known universe.  (Perhaps there is a better donut somewhere in the Tadpole Galaxy, but NASA has yet to confirm that.)    This particular donut was ever so slightly crunchy on the outside, yet moist and warm on the inside and covered in the most addictive, sweet and tangy, gooey strawberry glaze and then sprinkled with a graham cracker topping.  Ohmigosh... It was the stuff dreams are made of.  I'm pretty sure it was dry humping my tongue while I heard angels trumpeting somewhere in the background...  Stop what you are doing and go. Go right now.

I see that Fractured Prune has two Yelp listings, so I'll review them both.    I went again this morning and got a donut with blackberry glaze and bacon crumbles and it was a thing of beauty.  Also, their bold coffee is like a delicious shot of caffeine right to the jugular vein.  YES!!  I haven't been this excited about a new business before, but once you try their donuts you'll understand why I am...

I came with my husband, who grew up almost across the street from this bar and restaurant, back when it was called The Desert Rose, a run-down old bar favored by bikers, both the weekend 'hobby biker', and the less family friendly, full-time kind of biker.   Many years ago this was a regular diner that serviced the numerous families and busloads of people passing through on US Highway 80, which was the road of choice for points south and southwest from the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  They could stop here for soup, sandwiches, pie and yes, even beer.  Eventually US 80 was replaced by bigger and faster highways and it became more of a scenic back road.  The diner's business traffic dwindled and it became less of a stopping point for traveling families and more of a destination for bikers on road rallies and scenic rides.  I also grew up not far from it over in the Town of Buckeye, so I was no stranger to this old bar and it's past.    So THAT was how it came to be that my husband and I visited about 8 PM one Saturday night almost a month ago, desperately hungry and dead tired after a long day of remodeling work at a house we own in Buckeye.  We left our toddler with grandma and grandpa and headed across the street to finally see the 'new' restaurant in Arlington.    What's nice about the Co-Op Grill is that their menu is clear and simple, leaning towards basic grill fare: steaks, burgers and chicken, baked potatoes, French fries, cowboy beans and green salads.  There are a few other offerings, but by and large this is the bulk of their menu.   I firmly believe that a restaurant should find a few things they are really good at and just do those things well.  The Co-Op Grill adheres to this adage and does these few menu items quite well.  My husband ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and an iced tea.  I ordered a petite steak with baked beans, garlic bread and salad and a margarita.  Turned out they ran out of beans earlier that night so the waitress offered me a baked potato as a substitute, which was just fine.   Also, that was the most delicious, softest garlic Texas Toast I've ever had.  Damn, it was mouth wateringly good.     My steak was also delicious and tender and flame grilled over the fire pit out back with just the right amount of charring on the sides.  It was damn near perfect, *except* for the fact that I ordered it medium rare and got it VERY rare, almost blue throughout the center of the steak.  But I was so hungry that I just devoured all the parts around the outer edges that were cooked through.  I simply left the raw center untouched, not wanting to wait to eat any longer or to be a pain in the ass and have them re-heat the remains of a half-eaten steak.  As a SOP the grill master should do a firmness test to make sure it's cooked correctly before they send it out to the customer though.  My margarita was also delicious, except I forgot to specify, and the waitress forgot to ask, no salt.  Yuck, I hate salted rims.  (Is it weird that I despise salt on my margaritas?  It probably is.)  My husband had no complaints about his chicken sandwich, French fries or his iced tea.  He devoured everything.  The ambiance here is nice in a very relaxed kind of way.  The tables are long picnic tables and you sit on simple benches, the condiments are housed in a repurposed Corona six-pack caddy and there is a tin bucket at the end of the table for a roll of paper towels; it's all very informal, which suits this location perfectly.  The tables are all clustered at the end of an old fashioned dance floor and elevated stage and there seems to be a second, smaller, bar on the opposite side of the dining room too.  Plus, there is covered patio seating all around the front and sides of the building.  There was a jukebox playing music halfway between the main bar and the dining room and it was a teeny tiny bit too loud for my tastes, since it was just filling a large wooden room with music that noisily reverberated off of the wooden dance floors, but the music choice wasn't offensive and a few little kids were entertaining themselves, and everyone else, by dancing on the dance floor and stage area as their families dined.  It was cute to see the children playing so happily, without scowls of disapproval, in such a casual, family environment.  The weather is glorious right now and this whole area is very scenic, so pick a Saturday to drive out to the far southwestern part of Maricopa county and see the old Gillespie Dam just a few miles South of the Co-Op Grill, and take the family on a mini road trip, then stop back to enjoy a delicious steak or burger while your kids dance like little fools to the juke box.  You won't regret it.

I came here for a lunch a few weeks ago with a co-worker.  We both ordered bento boxes and iced teas.    The food was prompt and delicious and the service was friendly and unobtrusive.  Lunch for two was about $25 before gratuity.   I was pleased to see how nicely they had converted this restaurant into a Japanese eatery from its former incarnation; the décor is simple and elegant.   I'd like to see this restaurant succeed, as this part of the Valley needs more Asian eateries.  I'll be returning soon to sample their ramen bowls!

Earlier this week somebody kicked up a rock on the freeway and broke my windshield so I sent out several requests for a windshield replacement windshield on Yelp 2 days ago.    Not only did these guys reply to my online quote request right away, they were the lowest cost for matching OEM glass and, they didn't reply to my online request with a request for me to call them back for the quote, or for me to send them my phone number so they could call ME.  (I hate that.)  Note to all merchants: An online quote should be just that, ONLINE.  I finally finished the online quote discussions with their owner, Matt, and decided to book the appointment with them, and when I did call Matt to schedule the work he was courteous and my appointment was scheduled for the same day.  The technician, Ryan, came to my house and he was on time, efficient and super professional.  Consider me a super satisfied customer.

I brought my 2 littles here for my daughter's 5th birthday dinner.  It was just them and mommy and I thought we'd do something different for dinner since it was a special day.  They loved it...LOVED IT.  The cheddar cheese was by far their favorite of the two fondue choices (the other was Swiss, mommy's favorite) and they actually ate their veggies and ham cubes without any fuss because they liked dipping them in the melted cheese so much.  This was a huge win.  Oh, and the owners heard me saying something about it being m daughter's birthday and they brought her out a little birthday dessert, which I thought was super thoughtful and sweet.  I appreciated that, especially since we were doing such a low key birthday celebration anyway...  That made it more special, definitely.  PS: When you come here check out the super creative wall art.  ;)

My boyfriend and I brought our dog here after hiking last weekend; we sat on the patio and they thoughtfully brought out a bowl of ice water and a couple of slices of bacon for our dog!  (She was in doggie heaven!)  Our server was friendly, prompt and efficient and our food and drinks were good and well priced.  I had the appetizer of friend chicken livers and okra, it was very tasty and the food was piping hot.  He had a burger with green chilies and a delicious potato salad. The patio was clean, the décor was nice and the music playing overhead was perfect, with just enough Irish jigs thrown in to keep true to the Irish bar theme.    We will absolutely be coming back here again with our dog and next time we will likely bring our kids and friends too!

I went to a *very* exclusive party over the weekend.    A fried chicken + donut party...in my mouth.  I could dig out a thesaurus and use numerous nifty adjectives to describe their perfectly cooked fried chicken and melt in your mouth donuts, but instead I'll just repeat what numerous other Yelpers have already said; the chicken and donuts are phenomenal.    You really have to find out what the hype is for yourself.  You can score you own mouth-party invitation by popping over to Welcome Chicken + Donuts for lunch today.  (Oh, and you're welcome.)

My guy and I came here for piping hot bowls of noodles when the weather was cooler and we weren't disappointed.  The bowls of noodles were huge and the beef in mine was tender and flavorful.  (He ordered chicken and I think mine was the better tasting option.)   The value was really good for the taste and quality of food you were served.  I really enjoyed my food, and if it weren't the middle of summer and hot and yucky outside, right now I'd be totally down for a hot bowl of their noodles.    Maybe the next time I'm sick in bed with a cold or flu I can convince a certain someone to get me a To-Go order of yummy hot noodle soup from here?    *waggles eyebrows at him*

I came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and his best friend, who are craft brew fans.  We drove over from the East Valley to check it out.  They seemed to like the beer.  I don't drink beer and so water was the only other option.  So I mostly just looked at them, looked at the other patrons, tried to identify all of the 8 bit renderings of video game legends in the paintings on the walls, sipped my water and listened to the 8 bit, midi music playing overhead on a continuous loop as it slowly drilled into my skull.  A couple of thoughts...  It is a little off the beaten path and in a mostly vacant (at least on the weekend) light industrial/office park so look for the sandwich board signs to guide you if you come.  There were a few other patrons so we were able to pinpoint the location by seeing the cluster of cars parked outside.  There is no food offered, yet, but apparently you can bring in your own, which is a huge plus.  Also, there are no video games, huge bummer, but apparently locals also bring in their own games on Fridays for use...?  I am a HUGE fan of video games, both old and new, and I would suggest we trek back out here at some point *if* the owners brought in some retro gaming systems.  Wouldn't be too hard: Pick up some cheap televisions at a secondhand store (Goodwill occasionally sells them for $1 on special) and get some retro game systems and games for the patrons to enjoy:  Right now a Nintendo 64, with games, can be had on eBay for less than $100.   eBay also has Sega Genesis, Atari and Nintendo NES platforms with games for sale for dirt cheap too.  Imagine happy patrons sitting around sipping their beers and playing the games of their youth: Super Mario World, Pac-Man, Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Castlevania, or Mortal Kombat 4.    Think about that, get back to me.  ;)

I enjoyed two cups of coffee and the front lobby ambience here this morning, for an hour, as I waited for my table and watched people who came in AFTER me get seated...before me.  (We'd requested a table for two, at the first available spot: inside, outside, at the bar....didn't care.)  We kept checking our text messages as we thought maybe we'd missed our text alert that our table was ready.  Nope, we hadn't missed anything.  Yet people were walking in and being taken right back because their party, by blind luck, happened to fit the correct size requirements for the table that was currently available.    I know I wasn't alone in my anger and confusion over why people who came in after me were being seated before me because I watched a steady stream of other waiting patrons walk up to check on what was going on with their table too.  This seating arrangement seems grossly unfair.  Did I mention that I did this for an hour before I finally got mad and left?  And the kicker?  When we finally told them to cancel our table and that we were leaving BOOM a table for 2 was suddenly available!  I was at the Snooze in downtown Denver two weeks ago where I enjoyed amazing food, stellar service and our party was seated in 15 minutes flat, with none of this seating stupidity.   Get your shit together, Snooze-Gilbert.  Honestly...

Came here for the second time ever the other day and the adorable waitress with tattoos and long, pretty hair walked up to me with a sweet smile and confirmed that I wanted a margarita on the rocks.  I was in utter disbelief that she remembered my drink order from the one other time I'd been in, a couple of weeks prior, but I guess somehow she did.  Plus the margarita was delicious, and perfectly mixed.  Very impressive service!

I'm not a huge soda drinker, but this is a cute custom mixed soda concept that offers games and a casual environment for just hanging out and enjoying yourself in a non-alcoholic setting.  It's easily missed because of it's location at the end of the strip mall, but it's definitely worth a peek.

'Princess Peach' you alcohol based temptress, you...    I could have easily sucked down several of those amazing, tangy citrus and peach based cocktails named in a nod to Mario Brothers, while I relived my youthful days of (still) sucking at video games.  But alas while I *didn't* count calories back in 1987, when I was a PYT at the joystick of '1943: Battle of Midway', shooting Japanese Zeros out of the sky; I do count calories now and I knew those cocktails were too delicious to be good for me.  I had to call it at just two of them.  On the bright side, I was good enough at 1943 last night to get my initials on the game's leaderboard.  Also on the flipside, I was too slow to do it correctly in time and now it just reads S.O. is in 5th place.  (Yes, yes, I do feel like a fool, thanks for asking.)    The games are rad, the drinks are amaze, the pounding techno-blend music was perfect, and they even had Monty Python's 'Life of Brian' playing on the big screen TVs behind the bar.    Most excellent.

I relish the dark, dank, sexy atmosphere here.  This is MY kind of place; Out of the sun, hiding under the glow of dim lightbulbs, soaking up the slight dank, dampness that comes with all 100 year old basements, sipping something slightly venomous and potent.  These craft cocktails are quite special: very strong, perhaps slightly bitter, but also maybe still sweet, with a twist of unique flavor that you can't quite put your finger on, but you swear you recognize.  The aftertaste of each one leaves you confused but wanting more, like a sudden passionate kiss in the dark from a lover that you've only just met.  If you do not like this kind of low light, spider-like, muffled world I would suggest that you stay across the street at noisy, bustling San Tan Brewery, under the bright, cheerful sun and misters, and leave us misunderstood 'Children of Inadequate Lighting' to our own whispering world.  Just kidding, visit The Ostrich.  Enjoy a break from the sun and the heat and all the noise up top.   Who knows?  Maybe you'll find you like it down here in the cool darkness with us...and these strong, unique craft cocktails...

I recently stopped here to have a quick dinner after a movie and I was very impressed with the speed our pizza was delivered (less than 5 minutes) and the freshness of the pizza ingredients.  The actual pizza was tasty, with a perfectly browned, thin crust and delicately placed, fresh toppings.  The end result was a delicious, piping hot slice of goodness.  Also, you should know that I'm not a pizza fan and will only eat it as a meal of last resort, or if my dining companions insist on pizza, so when I say that I genuinely liked this pizza that is high praise indeed coming from me...a bona fide pizza curmudgeon.

The food was good but a couple of ordering observations:  Ordering at the drive through was like an exhausting game of 20 questions and I was counting on the employee to guide me as it was my first visit with my kids, but I think the employee just made it more complicated: What entrée?  What type of beans?  What protein?  So one kid's meal? Right?  Oh, two?  Okay.  Quesadilla for both?  Oh, taco on one?  Beef taco or chicken? What kind of drink?  Extra hot sauce? An 4 oz or an 8 oz?  And on and on...  We took at least 3 or 4 minutes just to order for 4 people.  It shouldn't take that long.  And another small observation was that I didn't realize what my bowl contained since the exterior menu isn't detailed so it was really was a 'surprise me' meal.  Plus, when I asked what the drink options were the employee simply said "we serve Coke products" but that doesn't help me at all if I haven't committed all of Coke's products to memory, or worse, I assume that means that you serve ALL of Coke's products and so I can order a Grape Fanta?    Anyway, the food is piping hot and good, but there were definitely ordering kinks.  I'll be back, but this time I'm coming inside to order my food.

Huge, huge international market. Everything you could hope for is here: produce, meat, seafood, spices, baking, noodles, frozen, dairy, beverages, candies, plus, they have all the personal care items and sundries you'd find in a bigger store.  (Small appliances too!)  This one is far bigger than all of the other Asian stores in the Valley.  I came on the grand opening weekend and saw the Chinese dragon dance.  My little daughter really loved seeing the dragons.  While I was there I took advantage of their phenomenal prices on produce and import goods.  I stocked up on produce, shrimp chips, bags of Nata de coco, and Jackfruit.    Everything was great except (isn't there always a disclaimer?) there were really long lines to check out and apparently I didn't see the small sign above the register saying that I was in the express line, so once I'd unloaded all my items onto the register belt the cashier nastily snapped at me that I was in the wrong line. 0_o Honestly, her tone was so rude and caught me off guard so much, that I almost said "Whoa...forget it." and just left.  But no, I was nice and apologized, and moved my items back to my cart and stood in line, again, for another 30 minutes to check out in the correct line.

I had a yummy lunch a few weeks ago here.  In staying with my 'ordering my entrée off of the appetizer menu' tradition I ordered the Charcuterie Sampler with an assortment of meats like capicola, salami and Canadian bacon.  Some pimento cheese, and smoked gouda, some sweet bread and butter pickles, sweet pepper jam, mustard, and grilled focaccia.  My only complaint is that I would have liked a different cheese option to split with the Gouda.  (Maybe half Gouda, half something else...?  It was a lot of Gouda in one sitting.)  For my libation I enjoyed a spicy cocktail with jalapeno infused vodka and blueberries.  I can't remember all of the ingredients in this cocktail or what it was called, but I know it was slightly spicy and I enjoyed it enough to order two of them!  We noticed their 'Buy a Buddy a Beer' board and we really liked it.  We tend to frequent tap houses, bars and craft breweries (that probably speaks volumes about us) and we hadn't seen that feature anywhere else, yet, but we'd like to.  The architecture in here was also cool, in a repurposed industrial kind of way and I liked seeing the bones of the older building reused for this creative new space.  Keep up the good work!

I was here last weekend for the first time to watch a COPA America match with my boyfriend.  I ordered the grilled pear a prosciutto flatbread with four cheeses, grilled pear slices, arugula and candied hazelnuts, and in keeping with my pear theme I had a pear martini to wash it all down and I have to genuinely say that my whole dinner was genuinely delicious!  The patrons around us seemed to be having a nice time, the ambience was upscale and beautiful, and the service was timely and friendly.  I can say with confidence that we will return soon.
