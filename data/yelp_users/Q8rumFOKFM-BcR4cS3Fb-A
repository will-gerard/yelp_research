Byblos has great food.  It's a family owned business and sometimes a little quirky but not in a bad way!  The food is authentic and worth any amount of waiting (lunch they are quick, I've waited longer for dinner when they've been busy).  Definitely go for the tomato soup, it's VERY good.  Shwarma beef is also a recommendation, I've had it over 20 times.  Their hummus and tebouleh salad is also some of the best in town.  Lastly, the honey pudding simply cannot be put into words.  If you at all like anything custard/creamy/pudding-like, just order it and thank me later.

Whitey's has been around forever, and for good reason. This is the quintessential mom and pop quality auto repair shop you can count on. They have a very experienced staff, fair prices, and do the job right. I will drive the extra 15 miles to take my cars to Whitey's any day.

Great energy in this place.  I have only been for a massage so far, but it was really good.  Everyone in there is down to earth.  Looking forward to getting my hair done here soon.

It's hard to find perfectly executed Panang Curry, but Thai Basil is a consistent winner.  Occasionally their sauce is a little runnier than I prefer, but the flavor is always excellent.  I've tried a couple of other items on their menu as well, but I love the curry dish so much I rarely order anything else.  It's definitely worth the wait or call in for carry out.  Lunch pricing is reasonable too.  Only four stars because it's just too darn small in there and for the inconsistent sauce prep.  Overall a great place to get Thai food in Tempe.

Now that the original owners are back at this location, all is happy!  This is not a gourmet establishment but for what they serve (lunch deli), they do a great job and offer friendly service.  The seating is ample, they have both indoor and outdoor along a pond.  Their BLT is fantastic, never scrimping on the bacon.  Though it would be nice to have a food establishment be more creative in an office park, I realize the costs are likely prohibitive.

Worked with Jeff. He is amazingly professional and available (at least in my case) on short notice. He trouble shot a strange situation while re-keying our commercial property space with ease. Would recommend in a heart beat.

This is a great place to get Thai food in the Tempe area.  The owner is the sister of a long-standing favorite Thai restaurant of mine, Mint Thai (in Gilbert), and has a lot of the same great menu items.  Curry Noodles, Panang Curry, and sticky rice with coconut custard are awesome!! They have a great lunch menu with reasonable prices, I highly recommend to any Thai food lovers or first-timers.

Cork is one-of-a-kind for this side of town.  They are creatively serving small plates with usually mind-blowing combinations.  Their food is usually sourced locally and they use both creative/unusual meats as well as traditional meats for their proteins.  Small plate sizes let you try more! Their service is top notch, they have a great happy hour and a very large wine selection that they're happy to help you with if needed.  I have no complaints about Cork except I wish they were a little bit closer to my neighborhood (Ahwatukee).

My four stars are in light of the fact that it's a fast Hawaiian BBQ place.  Hawaiian BBQ is not a gourmet delight. It should be decent, yes.  This place did decent went I went in the other day, so they get four stars.  I appreciate the affordability, timeliness, quality of the meat preparation, and flavor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ambiance is lacking (and it's a bit warm inside) and they used canned pineapple instead of fresh. However, what I did have was tasty (pineapple chicken lunch plate), and it was handled with efficient and polite service.    Other reviews docking this place with low stars isn't fair when you consider it's a fast Hawaiian style restaurant. It just isn't something that should be rated the same as your favorite special occasion spot.

Ahwatukee's farmer's market has grown tremendously each year I've been going (Since 2007).  There are several local farmers, a lot of other food vendors (fish, grass fed beef, cheese, baked goods, canned products, some freshly prepared food) and a handful of craft vendors.   This is definitly a must-do for Sunday morning shopping for anyone living in the Ahwatukee/Tempe/Chandler/Gilbert area.

The food here is okay.  It's because of the food that I give them two stars instead of one.  First things first, on a superficial note, this place does not have a comfortable ambiance.  It's very stark and wide open (and not in a ultra cool modern sort of way like they're perhaps trying), perhaps nice when crowded, but it certainly wasn't when I stopped in with some friends for lunch.  But that could be explained due to the fact their A/C was off and the doors were wide open.  At first we thought it was fine because there was a breeze and we were told by hostess and waitress the A/C would be on soon.  Needless to say, we didn't see an A/C repairman come in until we were finished with our meal.  There was one other table visible in the restaurant during this timeframe, and it took forever for the food to come out.  The appetizer came  out quickly, but our server didn't have much knowledge and wasn't able to answer many questions about the types of cheeses included on the fruit and cheese platter.  She tried, but it is nice to have knowledgeable staff.  Once we were ready to leave, "management" came out, not sure of the names, but two men wound up apologizing for the A/C being broken and if there was anything they could do, to let us know.  Um, it's too late.  How about take at least a $2 soda off our tab?  Or maybe that and the appetizer.  If they would have done this, I'd feel better about returning.  But now, there's really no chance.  It's unfortunate they didn't think of this or something else, customers will never tell you they want something removed when it's for an inconvenience.  To top it off, the funniest part was when we were walking out the door, one of the managers said, "come back another time and we'll get you some free cold drinks!".  After reading the review on here from just yesterday, I'm laughing to myself.  We all thought, "yeah...we're going to come back and ask for free drinks because you TOLD us"..how about gift certificates or taking something off our tab now?  It's clear these are just false gestures of customer service, they have no intention to do anything if they're not offering something on-the-spot to handle the bad situation.  Just a word to the wise.    The food was "ok".  Sandwich and sliders were a bit greasy and didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  All in all, edible and not horrible, but combined with the experience -- just plain bad.

Never heard back from Paul on the original issue from May 2009.  Not sure if the restaurant is still being run this way...hopefully not.  Mill Ave is a great location for restaurants but I can't say I want to go back to this one.

I sadly walked in this place to "finally" check it out on their last day of business.  Despite closing, the service was awesome, upbeat and professional. Their prices are also quite good. While I waited for my espresso drink (very good by the way), I enjoyed the ambiance of the cafe.  I hope they re-open somewhere nearby -- possibly Elliot & McClintock they say.  It's nice to have more locally owned places around, especially ones with great doughnuts.  Not that I need to eat them regularly, but it's nice to know of a "mom & pop" selling them. Thank you Cherubini and please re-open.

Hillside spot is a much needed breath of fresh air in chain-ridden Ahwatukee.  I know there's some local mom and pops in the area but they all seem to be Italian.  Hillside is a top quality fast casual restaurant serving locally sourced and environmentally friendly products.  The service is always really friendly.  I've been coming here since they opened and I've seen them grow over the last few months.  I'm so glad they're here. It's a great place for breakfast, lunch or a quick dinner.  It's fun to sit at the bar and watch the kitchen at work. Their retail area is cute but doesn't offer a wide selection.  This doesn't bother me since I'd rather see more tables than retail space!  They offer a variety of sandwiches, salads, baked goods, and mesquite rotisserie chicken (yum!).  Indoor and outdoor seating is available.

This is great local coffee! I tried from Whole Foods, Casa Blend, and it was very fresh really delicious.  Much smoother than many other popular roasters in the Valley.

This is great Mexican food at an affordable price and a great downtown Phoenix location.  The green chili pork chilaquiles and lime oregano roasted chicken are phenomenal.  Everything else I've had is great too, but that's the best so far!  Also a plus, where else can you get homemade flour tortillas in fast casual setting?    I also appreciate the owner's hospitality. You can tell they put their heart into what they do by just placing your order or having a quick conversation about the food.  This is definitely a must-go location for eating in Phoenix.

You can count on being pleased with the results with Lucky Shot Photography. Meg is a pleasure to work with and has a great eye for composition.  She is also extremely patient and easy going. This makes for a happy experience during the photo shoot.  Once you get your photos you won't be disappointed!!

4 stars for location - love the waterfront spot. 2 stars because the food and drinks were not good. Drinks are watered down and despite how the website reads, it doesn't appear a mixologist was involved in making their menu.   Staff is courteous and normally this would make my ratings increase but the food was not good. Bruschetta, which seems simple enough, was barely toasted, though edible, just ok. Wings were flabby - neither grilled nor fried. Not good. Overall just not the level of food and drink I want to pay for when going out. Their prices are average so it's not like you're "getting what you pay for" by receiving this level of food and drink. I love the location, but sadly I probably won't return.

Relieved honest, reliable service from ASAP Plumbing. Free quick estimates also available when needed. Nick was able to come out on short notice when a project timeline changed - I can't thank them enough for making it work, especially since it made it a long day for them. He also recommended other good contractors and can schedule work for related work that plumbers don't do. This is very helpful if you need things like countertops and tile along with your plumbing needs.
