What a mistake. I ordered rolled tacos with guacamole and it looked like Kermit the frog  had diarrhea on my rolled tacos. You call that guacamole? It was so watery. Guacamole should resemble avocados.   The beans were disgusting as well. I'm from San Diego and I'm getting convinced I will never find good Mexican food in Arizona.

I'm a brand loyalty kind of guy. Toyota, Lego, Apple, Dyson, Southwest, and of course Disney.  This visit took the cake. We bought a woody and buzz lightyear two days ago but after using buzz for a day, one of his lights stopped working. Our 4 year old really wanted it fixed but I told him we'd have to go back and just exchange it. I didn't even try telling him it's the same because we al know with toys, it's just not the same.   Of course Disney knows that so when we arrived, and after participating in the magical opening of the store, the associate quickly took buzz to Geppetto's workshop in the back. In a flash buzz was repaired. They even magically erased the little scratches that he had endured over the last few days. But clearly it wasn't a new buzz. Geppetto just fixed the old one.   Thank you Disney for never missing the little magical details.

Absolutely delicious and an extremely excited/friendly staff! I always get greeted the moment I walk through the door. The gelato hits the spot and they always have some new/fun flavor of the season. I loved the Guinness flavor and irish whiskey flavor for St. Patricks day.
