Very poor customer service here, especially displayed by store manager Angela. Needed a paint for a job I'm doing, and when asking for it, she stopped me to take a phone call. I'm happy to have yoy answer the ringing phone, but don't leave me standing here in front of you to listen to your conversation. I'm the customer standing here ready to make a purchase. After enjoying her phone conversation, she informed me the color i need isn't on their current inventory list. She did however offer to sell me a large batch of a non matching paint. Thanks Angela, your a real help and joy to spend my work day with. I'll go to lowes next time

Food here is so good. I've tried a variety of things including the meatball and sausage sandwich. My favorites are the calzones and the grilled chicken sandwich. If you haven't been yet, try it and you'll soon be a regular

Had one of the best pizzas I've ever had here last week. The wood fired mushrooms are an excellent addition to their perfect margarita pizza. I'd recommend bianco town and country to anyone.

Possibly my favorite place in town. Salty sow checks all the boxes. Great food, service, happy hour, and nightly specials. Glen, Kendra, and Tony are fantastic bartenders. Not quite sure why there are any negative reviews. Their rewards program is the beez knees  $5 for every $50 spent!

Just had some ahi tuna sliders. Super bomb. Alexa was my bartender and was very friendly. Great place to grab a bite.

Definitely love this place. The beers and wines on tap are awesome! I've had the burger several times and think it's among the best around. Insanely cool titos Bloody Mary bar on the weekends. Sit at the bar with Michelle, she's the best!

This place is absolutely phenomenal. It only took 100x driving and walking by before we gave it a try, and I'm so happy we did. Antonia took care of us at the bar. We started with the meatballs which were totally on point! The sauce was some of the best I've ever had. Next we each had a slice of their meat lovers pizza, which had some of the best crust I've had on a pizza in AZ. This was also complimented by that amazing marinara sauce. I then ventured into a stromboli full of meat and cheese and baked with a flaky crust rolled in sesame seeds. This was my favorite item of the night!  We finished with the dark chocolate gelato. Very tasty. I highly recommend this place. Food service and ambience are best in the Scottsdale/shea restaurant area.

So glad to have found this place. We tried just about everything on the menu, and had great recommendations and service from our bartender Michael. I highly recommend the yellow curry, red Thai chicken and rice, potstickers, and pho.

Went here on Saturday afternoon. Stumbled upon it through the Groupon they were offering. Everything we had was great. Started with seared ahi tuna which was cooked to perfection abs had a trio of nice sauces to compliment the flavor, and the sesame garlic edamame which was also very good. For lunch I had the tavern burger with fries. Cooked to perfection and had a nice Chipotle aoli. My gf had the French dip which she said was amazing.  Highly recommend this spot!

I previously gave this location 3 stars, it just got downgraded. After spending several months at the Indian bend location and revisiting here today the flaws are too much. This is the LA fitness of mountainsides. Every piece of equipment I load up seems to be fair game to just take over without any consideration. This goes for training staff and other members. I'm happy to share, please follow gym etiquette.  Staff is equally unfriendly here. Mountainside is a great company, this is just a location gone wrong.

Just had a great meal on the patio at pedal haus.  Our server aubree recommended the wings, tempura bratwurst, and my favorite the beef carpaccio. Everything was great. Very spacious and comfortable patio, nice crowd, good music, killer vibe. Can't wait till my next visit!
