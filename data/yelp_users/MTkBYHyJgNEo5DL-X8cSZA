Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl "Lucille". Showed no effort in helping or listening to anyone. I did see her chuckle away every time she glanced at her phone. I assume her texting or Facebook was much more important than injured people seeking help. The gentleman sitting next to me has a broken finger and he's been sitting here since 11am ( 7 hours ago ). I'm heading to another hospital and giving this gentleman a ride to get seen.

Staff are very helpful. People that complain about waiting for help is understandable. They have 4 guys in the tv department and 10 customers including myself. Unless they know how to duplicate themselves to help everyone all at once, I say they are doing a great job. People need to chill out. I continue to come here because the staff are very knowledgable about their product. Keep it up Best Buy, please excuse the rest of the people that clearly have no patience.

Beware!!! I came in to close my account months ago and they never did. Then i was charged overdraft fees because of monthly service fees. I went back to ask why the account was not closed, they responded that It was my responsibility to check if it was closed. The second time I went in to close it, I asked more than once if it was a done deal. The gentleman said " it will be by the end of the business day". The account still was not closed. Third time I came back in, I demanded a manager. Finally, they closed it after I truly expressed my feelings of frustration ( I really tried hard not to make a scene ).I chose a new bank next door and they know me by my first name. At Wells Fargo the same guy helped me 3 different times and asked me if I had an account with them. Enough said.

My 3 yr old son started coughing, and gagging at the dinner table. Turns out he had a life threatening allergic reaction from his meal. He was struggling to breathe all the way to the hospital. If it wasn't for the fast, hard working staff here... I would've lost my son tonight. Thank you Gilbert Hospital.

Everyone has been talking about this place ever since I moved here 10 years ago. I finally gave in and went to Famous Dave's for dinner! I have to say it was okay, nothing impressive. Don't understand why everyone swears it the best. If the price was a little more fair for what they serve, then I would say its a pretty decent joint. Overall, i left disappointed. Enough said.

Great service. Have been here so many times and the service is just as good as the last time. Price is more than fair and the environment is very friendly.
