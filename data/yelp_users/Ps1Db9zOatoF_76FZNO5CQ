I am surprised I have not reviewed this theater.  I have been here for several performances by the Arizona Theater company.  The place is always spotless.  The attendants, many of whom I believe volunteer their time, are always knowledgeable about seating and other questions I have had.  And the real attraction to attending a play here is there are no bad seats in the house!

I was here for Breakfast Club. I have heard for years I really need to go here.  Well, my friends were right.  The food and service were really good and I had to leave early so I gave my cash to another Yelper and consequently did not have to deal with the cluster of paying in a large party with one check.  I had grilled chicken breast with eggs and beans.  The chicken was topped with a red sauce, grilled onions and some mild jalapenos.  The parking has gotten so bad they make employees park off the property so some have quit after several break ins to their cars.  In the evenings they have security but only in the lot. They have supposedly bought the property to the North and applied to expand the building and add parking.  Talking to long time Hispanic residents, the building was once a dance venue with live bands. The biggest hangups about this place are parking and getting seated.  It is not uncommon to wait almost an hour including weekday lunch times.

Whataburgers are rapidly disappearing around here which I think is too bad as I like their food.  And they have used the fast casual approach in their dining room decades before the label.  They have always been good at preparing it with your choice of toppings and you can get a side of gravy for your fries.  This particular morning I was driving a bit of a different route and wanted a breakfast sandwich of some sort for a snack.  I spotted this store and got a breakfast biscuit with sausage, egg and cheese.  It came out quickly and it was indeed a good snack.  Of particular note was the biscuit itself was not old or crunchy.  This one I rounded up from 3.5 just because.

This was my second trip to the garden and both times I got to enjoy lunch on Ullman Terrace.  Two highlights of this visit were the Chihuly exhibit and the concert given by Try Me Bicycle.  Later in the spring the annual butterfly exhibit is really great too.  Although pressed for time we managed to see and photograph almost all of the Chihuly glass exhibit.  Sometime I would like to go in early March which is normally the best time for the flowers to bloom.  There are around 2 miles of well maintained trails and lots of employees and volunteers eager to answer any questions or show you something new.  The plants and other stuff on display are well documented.

I've been here a handful of times over the years for dinner.  Had no clue they had a weekend brunch menu.  I think I was the only one that  ordered off the regular menu in our group.  Based on comments no one went away unhappy with their choices.  Our waitress had never worked opening shift before but did a great job.  The place is getting a little worn but it fits.  I am sure I'll end up here again.

I actually went here over a month ago but felt it worthy of saving for my 200th review.  If it wasn't for Yelp I this is one of the places I have eaten I never would have known about.  And it is sort of fun to tell your date your are going to eat in a mostly vacated strip mall just off the highway. :-)  I had been here previously for a Yelp event.  We arrived around 6 on a Saturday just as it was getting dark.  We got seated right away.  Even at that early hour the place was far from empty.  It seldom happens we are amongst the youngest folks in any venue so we happily take note.  As the evening went on the crowd got younger and the place was almost packed.  We got our waters and menus right away and then we sort of got forgotten for about 5 minutes or so before our waiter introduced himself and took our drink orders.  That would prove to be the only glitch in food or service the entire meal.  I had the PCG pasta and she had a black and blue burger.  I also had a salad with Blue cheese dressing.  Lately we seem to have been on a run of less than stellar blue cheese, both my dressing and the crumbles on her burger were good.  We both enjoyed our meal.  Usually we try some of each others food but I declined to take a bite of a well done burger, however she thought it was great.  I did sample the fries and they were pretty good.  The beer selection had a couple of selections I liked to choose from.  Excellent place for a nice dinner out.  Even if you get in to steaks the place is not over the top expensive.  It was quiet enough we no trouble talking.

I really had a hard time rating this.  The first Whole foods I went to was one of the few big showcase ones in Town Center in Las Vegas.  I happened to be shopping at Penzeys in the same shopping center and knew I had to pick up some veggies for the weekend somewhere.  I found the store to be cramped and crowded.  And the price, I understand why folks call this chain "Whole Paycheck".  What made this place 4 star was the quality of the vegetables I ate during the week and the friendly service from every employee I came in contact with.

I stopped in in May when I was going to buy spices down the street.  Haven't been to an Islands in a while.  Had a very good blue cheese burger.  The service was good.  I got there right after opening time so the place was almost empty to start and only got about 1/3 full by the time I left.

So 22 days, 3 visits. First was to go look at a pre-owned bike they had posted on Craigslist.  A week later I picked the bike up and this week I picked up a special order helmet visor and a couple of other items.  Everybody I have come in contact with had answers to my questions and were very pleasant.  I have two Honda dealers and several aftermarket motorcycle accessory/service shops closer to me.  Unless something changes in the future I will keep coming back.

Yes I am giving a chain restaurant a 4. On our way to a Thanksgiving dinner in Vail we had made plans to stop for breakfast in Casa Grande.  I voted for Cracker Barrel, one vote for IHOP and 3 votes for Denny's so that is where we went.  We stopped in with a party of 6 and were seated immediately.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full.  Our drink orders were taken and filled right away.  The 4 year old in our group got his breakfast first.  All the food came out quickly.  There were no problems with improperly cooked/cold/burnt/screwed up ordrers.  The few additional requests (I asked for butter for my grits)  we made were handled quickly and with a smile.  This is definitely one of the better Denny's I have been in and would not hesitate to make this a road stop again.

Met Rand H and Mike C and Jackie C here for lunch today.  For a chain they do a pretty good job of making sandwiches, salads and soups.  And in the American tradition almost anything you order is more than you really need.  But it is good and you keep eating! :)

I like many types of Asian food and I noticed Flo's while grabbing a burger next door at The Habit a few weeks previous.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and given a choice of a table or the bar.  Being just a few minutes after opening the place was empty.  I chose a high top in the bar area.  Was given a menu and my drink order was taken right away.  I must not eat out in bar areas often, that was the first time I had seen iced tea dispensed from a bar gun.  When my drink came my salad came with it and the waitress took my order. The food came out in a reasonable time.  My waitress checked on me several times. The food was good.  I will definitely be back.  Other than the decor the place reminded me of the now shuttered Zang Asian Bistro in Glendale that I went to often.  Right down to the dressing on the salad.  Flo's also has many more items on the menu.  I also like that they have lunch pricing, and I assume portions, on most of their menu items.

Yesterday morning I met up with fellow Yelper Aileen B here for brunch. It was a lovely day so we sat on the patio, as did the majority of the customers.  We had a really cool waitress.  A couple of times our coffee ran dry but other than that I enjoyed the service.  The small kitchen is hard pressed to keep up with a busy Saturday morning and we both thought it took a bit too long to get our food.  The staff emphasizes a non rushed atmosphere.and as we had planned on a time that we would not feel rushed for each of us to get to work it was not a major deal.  However, if you want to get in and out quick this may not be the place to go.  Because we moved to another table that was large enough to accommodate our food order we saw our meal go to another table for a few seconds before the server bringing it out found us.  We both enjoyed our food.  For taste and allergy reasons we did not share our main entrees but we did share the corned beef hash.  All of our foods arrived at the table hot and just how we had ordered them.  Pricing was in line with where it was and the food served.  For those of you with dogs there is a section of patio on the East end that is dog friendly.

Joined up with some folks here for happy hour before a movie on Thursday.  The spinach/artichoke dip appetizer was great and really could suffice for two of me for a dinner.  The was my first taste of Kiltlifter and I am a fan!  The address shows Pima Rd and I spent 15 minutes cruising the parking lot before I figured out it faces Hayden.

A bunch of folks I know really like this place.  Only being open M-F it is not someplace I could normally get to.  Last week I had a free day on my vacation and drove over. Glad I did!  The place was hopping about 11 with the early lunch crowd.  It was clear most of the customers were regulars as they were being addressed by name.  I had the grilled cheese on sourdough and a cup of cream of broccoli soup. At first I thought there was something wrong with the soup until I realized it was not loaded with salt and the main taste was the broccoli, what a concept! It is really a nice friendly place with great food.

I was complaining about the lack of detail the place who has done my brakes for about 15 years and my business landlord suggested I try this place.  My dealer had told me 18,000 miles ago I was in eminent danger of running out of brakes.  I made an appointment for first thing on a Saturday recently to have my brakes inspected fully thinking I was going to buy front pads.  They had a problem getting a full staff on time that day and even though I showed up right at the opening bell a couple of walk ins were already on the racks and it took 3/4 of an hour before I was taken to see my car.  Brakes had plenty of pad left.  They pointed out some items that may need work soon and 15 minutes later they had my car buttoned up and I was on my way down the road.  No charge.  I liked the way I was treated as well as the way they were treating the other customers in the waiting room.  I will indeed take my car here when I finally need brakes.

I have no special allegiance to any Home Depot in particular but most of the time for the last 8 years this has been the most convenient one for me.  While Home Depot will never equal the service and atmosphere of the better Ace Hardware locations there are just things they do better because of their size.  Typical of most of my visits all but one of the folks I dealt with were friendly and helpful.  Over the years the company has gotten better at insisting their employees treat customers as first priority to anything else they are doing.

I really need to bump up this rating.  I've been back several times, trying something different each time.  Sometimes medium spice nears my limit but all the food has been great.  Last time I was in it was pointed out they have a smaller portion lunch menu so I don't have to pig out in  the middle of the day.  The woman running the front end knows I don't take lemon in my iced tea.  I'll keep coming back.

This is one of those places friends have recommended for years.  I go to the gym on this corner, I eat breakfast next door, but I am just not in that area of town when I go out to lunch or dinner.  Recently I met up for lunch with a friend who works out of his house just up the street.  Thursday lunch was packed shortly after opening.  The whole time we were there there was no more than 2 or 3 open tables.  Service was attentive.  Chips and salsa came out quick, as did the food order.  I preferred the hotter of the two salsas.  I had a chicken taco and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. It was one of their lunch specials and pretty reasonably priced.  There were some more exciting things on the menu but what I had was well executed.  It may not be a full 4 but it is worthy of more than a 3-1/2 rounded down.  I would definitely go back.

For the second time in about a week I slept in and needed to find something to eat on the way.  Last time I got a donut and a bagel someplace else and was disappointed in the bagel.  I had not been in this Einsteins in over 10 years.  Not much has changed, a few more menu items.  I got an onion bagel with salmon schmear.  Much better!  These may not be the best bagels in the valley but are as good as it gets for this neighborhood.

Ok so Walmart is supposed to be Walmart no matter which Supercenter you go to.  First off of the five I have shopped at in the West Valley they have had 3 different floor plans.  So there is a difference in finding stuff.  I was getting tired of the experience at the one I used to shop at on the way home from work so I checked out 2 others.  This one is by far the best Supercenter I have ever been in.  I have to pass by two others and my apartment to get to this one.  The floors are clean, the parking lot is clean, it is well lit inside, there is plenty of aisle space, all of the shelves are stocked neat and orderly.  They even have produce that looks like you might want to eat it.  They always keep enough registers open to service the number of people in the store.   Everybody that works there is friendly and willing to help you lift, find, whatever.  I have now been going about once a week for 2 months and unless something changes this is MY Walmart.  I did ask a couple of the check out people why this store is so much more pleasant to shop in and one of them responded that the manager has a vision of what his store should be and makes sure the entire staff buys into it.  Yes it's Walmart but as long as they keep it up this store deserves the 4 I gave it.

Had lunch here with Rand H this past Wednesday.  Arriving before the lunch rush about 11:30 they worked with us old folks to find seating we would both be comfortable with.  The service stayed great throughout the meal.  Our server knew the answer to our questions.  Macayo's is not the only Arizona chain to have done well with Americanized Mexican food.  It is prepared well, tasty and presented well.  I would suggest if you order steamed veggies as one of your sides you ask for it in a separate dish as the water will drift in to your other items.

I had been needing a battery for quite some time for a portable phone in the shop.  This morning my fob for the car quit working.  After figuring out how to take it apart to get the battery number it started working better than it had in weeks.  I needed some help getting the correct phone battery.  After that I questioned the sales person about my car fob and she knew just what the problem was and charged me a whole dollar to resolder the battery tab.  They have an incredible assortment of specialized batteries in stock.  And friendly staff that knows their stuff.

I've had mostly good experiences here.  Mostly I go here for the Healthcare clinic for blood tests and ongoing maintenance for my hypertension.  All three of the PRNs I have met have been very thorough.  But they were also handy when I came down with strep last year.  The pharmacy is nice. If you are paying out of pocket for generics make sure to buy in to their discount plan. I've also bought some other health incidentals while in there.

I have been buying my work shoes here for several years since before the Red Wing store in downtown Glendale closed.  I now even have the same sales person at this store so he has been fitting most of my work shoes for about a dozen years.  It is a good thing I get a lot of service out of my work shoes as they do not come cheap.  Right now an American made basic work shoe is going for $162.  Just like the nearby New Balance store they do not carry a full line or a very deep stock.  This time they are shipping my shoes to work at no extra cost as they did not have my size in stock.

This first time I wandered in here a few years ago I was looking for a gift that was to be shipped out of state.  Without letting on she was the intended receiver I had asked whether women preferred flowers or chocolates.  Her answer was yellow and pink roses could always be given to friends.  So off to the mall I went, thinking I was probably getting perfume at some kiosk or something.  I wandered into Yankee Candle and they had a pink rose scent.  The receiver loves candles and when she got it a few days later she understood the connection to the generic question and enjoyed the candle.  I have been back several times since then to buy candles for my apt (they smell better than smoke) and for gifts.  They always seem to have something on sale, with their biggest sales in January and July.  Yesterday I purchased two large Pumpkin spice jar candles, the second being 1/2 off.  I have a problem with drafts when the A/C is running and by buying an Illuma-lid I can get several months out of each candle even burning them every night.

This did not start out well.  I showed up for breakfast only to find I had to cool my heels in the parking lot until they opened at 7.  And they actually opened at 7:04.  And even then they really were not ready to serve customers.  I got my coffee fairly quick, then my orange juice, then my bread (muffin) and finally about 7:30 my breakfast entree.  The waitress even apologized for the excessive wait time.  The food itself was ok.  I had chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, fruit and a muffin.  The muffin was applesauce something and was really good and huge.  The gravy was sort of thin.  None of the flavors stood out.  Being a little more expensive than some other breakfast spots I expected more taste.  That and being late/slow cost it a half star and in this case I chose to round down.

I had not been here since the aquarium was first built. We went out for an evening just to see the aquarium which is still $18 per adult after 5PM.  I had a coupon though from the Hickman's egg carton so it was 1/2 price.  Being that late in the day we pretty much had the place to ourselves and took our time viewing and reading about the different exhibits. I enjoyed my time there but I wouldn't go again unless I had a kid in the group to see it with different eyes.

I've been to both locations a couple of times now.  I have never gotten daring with my menu selection, ordering Pasta Tagliani each time. But I have sampled other's meals and a couple of deserts. The food over almost 20 years has always been consistent.  I have always had great service.

Some friends called while I was in the grocery store Saturday night and asked me to meet them there for dinner.  That changed my plans significantly for the evening.  Good thing I had not already picked up the salmon I was planning on.  Arriving about 6:30 you would never know there was a recession in progress.  Firebirds shares a lot with 3 other chain restaurants and I had to circle the lot a couple of times to find a spot.  Without reservations we were quoted 40 minutes which turned out to only be about 25.  Courtney, our waitress, was on top of her game.  She was right there with iced tea refills and knew the answer to every question we asked except one allergy related question and she was back quickly with that answer.  The folks next to us had a small child and she made sure the apps hit the table fast to keep the child, who was a perfect angel the whole time, busy and happy.  All of us were very happy with our food except for one minor thing.  I had ordered my blue cheese filet medium and it came medium rare which will quite often leaves the middle too chewy for my liking.  I pointed it out to the waitress and she immediately offered to take it back and cook it some more and in another minute the manager was there with the same offer.  As it worked out it was acceptable for a couple of reasons; it was a good piece of meat to begin with and because I had not yet finished my salad it got to sit a bit before I cut it open.  So I would not let them take it back.  They did insist on my taking a dessert to go and I got the creme brulee cheesecake which I used for a delicious lunch the next day.  Inexpensive this place isn't but it was an excellent dinner.  The service was great.  While they were quick to get stuff to the table I noticed they were not rushing couples that wanted to linger over coffee either.

I've stopped here a few times on my way to Vegas.    The alternative is to fight for a parking space at MCDonalds up the street and somehow fighting to park at McDonalds just feels wrong.  The building is different than most Burger kings and has what looks to be a nice shady patio for outdoor summer dining.   Just before 9AM they were out of biscuits.  And the restroom could use some attention.  I ended up taking a breakfast Ciabatta sandwich, which was pretty good, and a small decaf on the road with me.  The Seattle's Best version of decaf is no better than what it replaced and in the small version uses a cup that doesn't work well in my cup holders.  I'll probably stop here again in the future because it is convenient but I am still not very impressed.

I'm glad I ended up here a second time.  There was nothing really off with my red curry with chicken but I had ordered medium heat and what I got was about a 2 compared to the Thai places I frequent in Phoenix.  The second visit I started to order the chef special curry and the waiter inquired as to my normal favorite Thai dishes and suggested I should really try the Panang curry which I had never had.  So I did.  And this time medium heat was 4.5 which is certainly close enough to 5.  Just different chefs in the same kitchen will quite often vary more than a full point.  I still think I like the thinner gravy to soak the rice in of the red curry, but I like them both.

Christmas day.  Vegas Yelper Angela H and I were meeting for lunch.  We both like anything Asian and the first place we tried took 10 minutes to park only to find out it was an hour wait.  Mind you we are doing this in different cars coming from opposite directions and I only sort of know the area.  So I drove right by the place looking on the wrong side of the street.  We ended up meeting and leaving both cars at Walgreens as were were only 2 doors away.  There is a reason Asian restaurants are open on Christmas, Asians want to go out to eat.  The lobby was full but because there were only two of us instead of a family of 6 or more like most of the groups we were seated in less than 15 minutes.  We ordered potstickers, Kung Pao chicken and crispy noodles with shrimp.  The portions were large and with the exception of not much spicy heat in the Kung Pao they were very well prepared. After we were done eating Angela took home at least half of what was served.  Understandably it took the kitchen a while to get our orders up.  In spite of the place being packed with a waiting line most of the time we were there we never felt rushed.  And after all the food the bill was very reasonable.    Overall one of the better Chinese restaurants I have been to.

So I missed the Yelp UYE but 2 months later Smunch visited and I made it.  This time, as opposed to the UYE at the Scottsdale location, I did indeed have a chicken and waffle along with cheesy grits.  Good stuff!  This is one of those legendary downtown restaurants worth making the drive and maybe a bit of a wait for.

I am not really a big fan of pizza, even less so of mediocre ones. Right now my stomach is unhappy with me over my impulse choice for lunch.  The peperoni pizza I got was lukewarm, greasy and chewy.  Flavor wasn't too bad.  There is no inside seating, the one time one of my employees went over to get lunch for the crew she had to wait outside.  So it is take out or delivery only.  They (crew) did say they thought the subs were better than the pizza and both of them like pizza.  So how did I end up consuming a 12" pizza for lunch?  Every so often in the late morning one of their drivers comes through the complex offering pizzas for $6.00 (used to be $5).  That really is a pretty good price for a delivered one topping pizza.  Selling door to door like that I didn't even think about a tip and after eating the pizza I didn't feel bad about it.  You do have to admit it is a pretty good marketing scheme to hit up industrial areas just before lunch.  I think he only starts with 10-12 pies so they cannot get too cold before he is done.  I usually pass and will for quite a while yet now.

I've made this part of my regular lunch rotation and as such it has earned a fourth star.  The food at the salad bar is always fresh, most times they even have avocados.  The service is always efficient and friendly.  Only a couple of changes have occurred since I started going here.  The most notable just happened recently.  They changed some of the items on the $3.99 express lunch menu (you can still ask for the grilled cheese with bacon and tomatoes) and now if you want to add the salad and drink it bumps it to the same $9.99 as their regular lunch menu with salad and drink.  This gives you more options but at a cost.  Seems they were getting into fights with people who couldn't read the dine in only sign in large letters and wanted to pig on the salad bar and then get a to go box for the entree.  Even at $9.99 it still is a good lunch deal in my opinion.  One thing not advertised is if you are getting the salad bar you can choose not to get a side with your entree.  That works out well for somebody like me that cannot eat as much as I used to so I can have a decent sized salad, a bowl of soup and still have room for a bowl of ice cream.  Another trick: The ice cream bowls are really small to make a sundae so I grab a soup bowl. :)

Rand H sent me an email the other morning about meeting here for lunch.  It was close and I could make it so I joined him.  Over the years I have liked Olive Garden pretty much.  Right now they have a never ending salad and pasta special going on for $8.95.  I make red sauces at home so I tend to get white sauces when I go out.  This time my choice was Alfredo on spaghetti which came out just as expected.  Instead of getting a second bowl of pasta I chose to make the serving bowl of salad a single serving size and only had one bread stick.  We were greeted immediately upon entering and seated.  It didn't take long for our waitress to show and offer us a sample of wine which I had to turn down because I was going to spend the afternoon running machinery.  The service was good throughout the meal and the staff worked as a team when they needed to.  This was my first time at this location and I would certainly return.

There are several outposts of Lenny's around town.  This is the nicest one I have been to.  Getting there at the end of lunch hour it was quiet.  By the time I was done the place was packed again and people were waiting for tables to clear.  I don't think I have ever had a bad meal at Lenny's and my Mushroom Swiss burger and fries this trip were no exception

So the nose piece breaks on my glasses while working. My eyesight is so bad, even with 6x magnifiers I could not see exactly how it broke. I got through some had to do stuff with my glasses on a tilt and hopped on Yelp to find a repair place. This one had mostly good reviews so off I went. Certainly not on the best corner in town as it looks sort of dumpy and it can be hard to get in and out of because the little strip mall is so close to the corner. I walked in and handed the gentleman my glasses and he gave me a quote of $12 said he would have mine done in just a few minutes. True to his word, I was out of there in 3 minutes and the charge was $12.

So I finally had a meal in the funny looking building.  I quite often get coupons for this place and decided to check them out.  Got there right at opening (10:45).  Everything was out and ready.  Everything was neat and fresh.  One of the soups out was not on the online menu and the mushroom soup was missing.  The front end manager noticed my hesitancy in choosing a soup and made a comment and I told him I was looking for the mushroom soup and he said somebody forgot to order the heavy cream called for and the back end manager was out scouring stores looking for enough.  So I tried a pretty good vegetable beef..  Of course I built a big salad and also had a cold noodle salad and some potato salad and some corn bread.  The only thing I really did not care for was the pizza, but then again this isn't a pizza place.  About 1/2 way through my meal the manager brought over a bowl of mushroom soup from the back, still without the cream but quite tasty.  While this place should be a 3, that attention to customer service in a buffet got them a 4th star.  Everybody I came in contact with was pleasant.  Overall I think I prefer the salad bar at Sizzler because it does a better job of the hot area while being about equal on the salad part of it and they are just down the street from my shop.  But I just might make the drive again with another coupon.

Earlier in the week one of my customers from Wickenburg mentioned he had just come from lunch here and when he lived in town it was a regular stop for him.  So I Yelped it while he was here and found not a single bad review.  After a disappointing time at the MVD I needed to treat myself to something good.  Ambiance - OK so this is not a place to impress a date.  It's a bit, OK a big bit, dated.  But it is really clean.  A total of 11 tables and 3 of those could be moved and joined for a party of 10-12.  Most of the customers were regulars for a Friday lunch and 5 tables were in use.  The waitress (owner?) doesn't smile much but she is pleasant.  Service - After being asked my party size I was told to pick a table.  As soon as she had finished serving another table she brought over my service and a menu.  She gave me a couple of minutes and then came and took my order.  When my iced tea was running low she appeared at my table with a pitcher.  There is a quiet relaxed feeling to the whole place and if you go with that vibe you will find the service to be quite good and actually faster than it feels when checked with a watch afterward.  Food - This is the fourth star!  I had Chicken Apollo, chicken breast with sauteed spinach, feta cheese on fresh baked bread.  The bread as listed is pita but it is something different and better.  It came with a "small" Greek salad that took up a good portion of the dinner plate with basic iceberg, large chunks of tomato and cucumber and a couple of Greek olives topped with feta cheese and an oil/vinegar dressing. With iced tea and tax the bill was $8.93.  Definitely a place to put on the list for more visits to try other menu items.

The last time I was in this store was about 9 years ago when I bumped my RAM from 256 to 512.  This time I bumped it to 2gig and it was much less expensive.  I got helped both times by somebody who knew what they were doing and got what I needed on the first try.

Went here for the International UYE.  I have been meaning to try this place since before I was a Yelper. Glad I got the chance.  All of us knew there was one waiter and one cook in a tiny kitchen in advance so having the food come out as it was ready for each of us was not a problem and all of the dishes seemed properly done.  I wish more large groups and small restaurants would accept that as normal practice. As with any restaurant there were some items that were misses based on expectations.  Overall most of us liked what we had.  The owner ran the front of the house well while his wife/ co owner did all the cooking.  It was a very pleasant evening and the pace allowed us do quite a bit of chatting without feeling rushed.  There were also several good sized to go orders picked up while we were there.  I got the impression that they were not phoned in as it seemed folks stood around a bit waiting for their orders.

I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know it's un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasn't earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.  For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.  This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too.

Ok, so the take on this place for the last few years is: the food is great, it takes forever and the service sucks.  Well a few months back there was a management change and I am here to tell you it's all great now,  I was here last Saturday with the Smunch group.  Chef Elizabeth is active in both the kitchen and the front of the house.  The place was packed most of the time we were there and the two wait staff and the busser who also delivered food were running the whole time.  Our waiter knew the entire menu and what could be substituted/changed and what the price differential would be.  Chef Elizabeth visited our table several times and even took a picture of one of our tables and posted it on Twitter while we were still there.  I chose the white flannel hash and it was delicious. And the over easy eggs were perfect and the English muffin I chose was very good.  The only thing was some of the corned beef had a chewy bacon consistency to it.  I expect food cooked from scratch to take about 15-20 minutes depending on the size of the party and I was not disappointed.  The staff took care to see the young ones got food first when it was apparent which foods they were getting.  Even though it is an hour drive for me I am real tempted to go back again, soon.

I was treated to a guest pass here this past Saturday.  I guess I was expecting more.  However I found out just now the normal entrance fee is only $7 if you are not a member so I really should write this as a 3 1/2 .There are 5 rooms, roughly the size of the original UA5 theater that was the prior tenant in the building, one of which is usually under construction as a new exhibit.  Contemporary art is sometimes elusive to its end purpose and our group had those discussions as we went back and forth between the rooms.  The cartoon art area had an interactive section for kids.  As I write this review I am seeing it as a bump to 4 instead of rounding down to a 3.  If it is in your area after a breakfast or a trip to the farmers market it is worth a trip to visit and the money spent will help it to keep growing so you can go back again in a year or so and have much of it new.  And if you have kids it is really a must go to place.  They also have several programs going on that should be checked into.

A group of us went here Sunday after a Yelp event at Sea Life.  Parking is really bad.  We were told a 20 minute wait for a party of 8 and that was pretty much spot on.  Judging by the crowd outside I was surprised it was not longer.  Service was pretty quick except for one breakfast.  I had a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon with a side salad. The food is basic diner fare done right but nothing that will wow you.  I would say 3-1/2 stars but rounded up in this case. If I was in the area I would not hesitate to go here again.

Before Christmas my son and his girl friend came up from Tucson for a visit and to exchange baked goodies.  She had passed on she was in the mood for Chinese.  And being one woman and two men Chinese was of course the only option. :-)  Not knowing what their itinerary was I figured I would choose something in the Tempe area so their drive back would be shorter.  So I plugged that in to Yelp and up came Tott's with a good strong 4 after over 40 reviews.  Located in a shopping center on the Southeast corner of Guadalupe and McClintock it was easy to find.  It shares a building and patio area with Starbucks.  I was intending to pick a place with waiter service for this and did not realize it was fast-casual until too late to change the meeting.  Well fast-casual may be what it is set up for but with the owner(?) running around taking care of things you would think you were getting waited on most of the time.  First we shared a sampler platter and then I got Hong Kong stir fry, my son got Pad Thai and his girlfriend got Singapore noodles with shrimp.  He confirmed she wanted a hot dish as she was ordering it and she said she indeed got about as hot as she could stand.  I like the fact none of the dishes were swimming in sauce, so we could taste the individual items, which can happen at many Asian restaurants.  In fact I could have used a touch more and almost used one of the dipping sauces for the last bit of rice.  Much better, in my opinion, to add a little more if needed.  The whole meal came to under $40 including soft drinks and tea.  There are dozens of Asian restaurants in the valley that also do take out as a large chunk of their business.  For the most part they do a decent job and in my book rate in the 2.8-3.2 range.  This one I give a 3.6 rounded to 4.  The place is very clean.  They are willing to modify dishes.  The service is above average for a fast-casual restaurant.  I am glad my fellow Yelpers led me here.

I have been using this store for 17 years.  Several years back it moved a couple of doors down in the same strip mall.  At one time I had a mail box here too.  That was back in the day when it was a Mail Boxes Etc. store.  When UPS bought the franchise the surcharge went away to take stuff there so I started doing all my shipping here. The surcharge is now .20.  The owner and his employees have always been nice.  Many folks like me started not driving to UPS any more so in the last few years they have been much busier but I seldom have more than a couple of folks in front of me when I go in.  Their packing materials are pretty expensive but I usually recycle stuff that has come to me.

This isn't even where I started out to go for lunch today.  I was driving down the road and it caught my eye.  I have eaten from here several times but this is the first time I have been in one of their restaurants.  Even though I like their chicken it seems like the order gets screwed up about half the time and I don't go back for a while.  Like many fast food places the order seems to be correct most of the time when eating in.  I had a breast with macaroni and cheese and cole slaw.  It comes with a couple of tortillas (flour or corn).  I tried the salsa and spicy avocado from their salsa bar, neither was great but both edible.  I have had better Horchata but again it was ok.   For $8.20 total with drink I was happy.  The restaurant inside was clean and the staff friendly.  Being a beautiful day outside I would liked to have sat on the patio.  Here is where they lost a star, the tables looked liked they had not been cleaned in several days and the patio trash bin was way too full.  I am sure I will eat here again.

The question I just know is right on the top of your mind is where does Scott get those snazzy charcoal uniform clothes he wears every day.  Well, for about the past 15 years it has been at Collette's.  I started buying from them shortly after they opened this location.  Prior to that I used another place a little further away that stressed work uniforms rather than medical/school uniforms in their advertising.  That place went under so the next time I needed some shirts I tried Collete's and have been going ever since.  This is a family run place, almost everybody working there is related or long term friends in some way.  It is not uncommon to have kids running around.  In the same building is a machine shop and a Realtor that are also in the family.  They have added 3 other locations in the valley but this is still the main one.  They handle just about any kind of uniform (medical, school, trades) you can think of.  The do embroidery and alterations on site.  I didn't ask but I bet they can even do bowling shirts.  Over the years they have amassed a wide array of vendors.  They don't take checks but do take cash and credit cards.  Even though they have a ton of inventory most of their sales are special order and subject to the whims of their vendors.  Because I was dumb enough to order a new set of shorts when the rest of he country hadn't warmed up yet it took 3-1/2 weeks.  Expect to pay at the time of order.  Surprisingly heavy duty work clothes are not that expensive and some of the polo shirts, slacks and stuff doesn't have that industrial look to it.  Over the years this has just been a really laid back, comfortable place to do business with.

I have had several vehicles brakes done here.  The service manager, Lonnie, has been here 14 years.  As brake shops go there are no worse than most.  They are always friendly.  So why only two stars?  Attention to detail.  This appointment was for a wheel stud that Discount had stripped and so it was no charge to me.  I had stopped in a few days before to set the appointment and was assured to proper parts would be there.  They had the stud but just tossed on whatever lug nut they had which not only looks different than the original equipment, but when I go to sell the car and remount the wheel covers I will have to find a stock lug nut.  They quite often will quote a 5PM finish time and it winds up being 6 or 7.  It always seems like the vehicles need calipers or rotors by the second time the pads wear out.  If you keep your vehicles a long time like I do brakes are eventually free because everything you buy is lifetime warranty.  Because they are a known quantity I will most likely keep going back.

Way back when this used to be part of a used car lot.  Shortly after I moved to the area Staples took over the building and I have been coming here since.  Service varies depending on the folks working here at any given time.  This latest experience was very good.  I needed business cards and envelopes because of a move.  If I had just gotten the business cards they will print them while you wait and their prices have come down considerably over the last year.  Because my order was bundled with the envelopes I get to wait a couple of weeks.  And they now will ship it all to me at no extra charge.

For 17+ years I have been coming here when I need hardware stuff.  Almost every hard to find item I have brought in they have been able to get and most of it has been in stock.  It is nice to know, when I was married, I could send my wife in with a sample or a note and they could still fill the need.

I needed to find a pair of pajamas for an event tonight and ended up here.  This is not the most convenient Target for me but over the years I have found it to be the neatest and best stocked of the stores I can reasonably drive to.  I started out to just pick up a couple of things and almost did not get a cart then realized that would be dumb as I knew I would wander a bit.  I ended up with 4 items total.  It had been a while since I had been in this store, when I first got my apartment it seemed like I was here every week,  and I found everything still neat and well stocked.  In spite of the city of Glendale making "improvements" on Northern there appeared to be the normal amount of customers late on a Thursday.  When the cashier line all of a sudden got long two managers opened up registers to clear the line.  I go to Target when I want to get stuff that is a step up from what Walmart carries.  That may be only a perception on my part as I know they are considered direct competitors in the same market.  This one gets a 4 not because Target is a great shopping destination but because this particular location has continued to a better than average Target in terms of the shopping experience.

I've always bought cards at whatever store was handy.  Well I wanted a particular genre of cards that I couldn't find so I stepped out of my box and went in here. Glad I did! when I explained what I was looking for to the staff I was directed to one aisle and one of the staff went to check another area.  I found the perfect card!  I'll be back again.

My son got married this month and they chose Men's Wearhouse because it had locations everywhere people were coming from.  These folks know what they are doing.  The whole process of measuring, picking up and returning takes 3 visits.  They have their system down so well that the 3 visits can occur at 3 locations if need be without a hitch.  I happened to do all three here even though the wedding was in San Diego.  Every time I was in and out quickly.  Only needed a couple of adjustments when I tried the suit on at pickup.  None of the wedding party had any real issues even though we dealt with a total of about 6 stores.  The only thing I would change is making the return the second day ofter the event rather than the next day.

This place is definitely on my going to breakfast short list.  Not very often convenient for me but a very nice place.  Food is always good.  In addition to the daily specials they have a pretty good creamed chipped beef which is something you cannot find every where.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The place has that comfortable local feel to it you cannot get in a chain.

This is the reason I like shopping with a small local place.  I went in late in the afternoon with a leaky tire.  He confirmed my suspicion that I would need a new tube and proceeded to install it while we chatted about bicycles and small business climate.  Then he tried to charge me less than the service was worth, especially as I did not have to make a second trip back to pick up the tire.  They have been in business with the same owner for I think over 20 years, now in their 3rd location.  I have an issue with a seat post so I will be back in soon.

This place has been on my to try list since before I knew what Yelp is.  I made it my choice when I won a football bet last fall.  Yes, I know football season has been over for a while but diets, cash flow and life in general, on both sides, made this dinner wait.  Suffice it to say the company was worth the wait.  When we got there about 6:30 on Saturday the parking lot was packed and we were worried we would be stuck in the bar with our growling stomachs.  It turned out we were seated immediately although there were only a few tables open.  We started with a half order of onion rings.  These are hand made in house and served with a really good dipping sauce.  Both the rings and the sauce reminded me of Lenny's (which got rid of their sauce and started buying frozen onion rings) only one notch higher.  We were both thinking ribs in a BBQ joint and she got the baby backs and I got the St Louis style spare ribs.  She got the fall off the bone she wanted and I got the slightly chewy I wanted.  Of the sauces I preferred the cajun which was only mildly hot, however the ribs were good enough they really didn't need much sauce.  We both ordered different sides so we could try many of them.  We liked them all but my favorites were the cole slaw and the macaroni and cheese.  The only soso item was the dinner roll but even there they are smart enough to serve soft butter.  The service was attentive without being obtrusive the entire time.  Our waitress had the answers to all of our questions without having to go ask.  Sort of an anomaly in the North West valley, you can arrive here between 7:30 and 8:30 and the place will be sort of quiet between the Sun City folks and the later night crowd and be seated right away.

I came down sick on my last trip to Las Vegas. On my last evening there i decided soup would be a good thing and remembered this place was there. Not being a sushi fan I had never been here. But it seems just about every Asian cuisine has some sort of noodle soup. I was not disappointed. There were a few. I chose the beef stew version. It was really good. My only complaint is whole short ribs are hard to handle with chopsticks. Service hiccuped a bit as I had arrived just before shift change but it only took them a couple of minutes to figure out I was forgotten after my drink arrived. Good I arrived early as there was quite the wait by the time I was done.

It's inside the Venetian.  It's part of the Wolfgang Puck chain.  It's 25% more than a similar meal off the strip.  That being a given the service was excellent even though they were packed at lunch.  The roasted turkey on sourdough with chips was very good.  I also had a beer that at $8 was a bit over priced anywhere off the strip.  I had a seat with great people watching.  Normally I avoid strip places just because of the value factor but I would definitely lunch here again.  Interestingly what drew me in was the corned beef Reuben but I changed my mind based on I prefer sourdough to rye.

I have been in here several times.  I usually go in looking for one thing and they don't have exactly what I want but for some reason some other thing or things just reach out and jump into my arms I am the the new owner of "----".   Dirt cheap prices.  I think it is one of the better stores in the outlet center.  But then again I don't go looking for trendy stuff, which this store is heavy on the conservative side.

OK, I admit to being a kitchen toy (tool!) junkie.  Probably the 5th or 6th time I have been in this store over the years.  I swear I was only going to window shop this time but I found an insulated drink mug that would fit in my console and not interfere with the parking brake lever that I could not pass up. :-)

So I didn't discover baseball until the Diamondbacks.  Growing up I had the Santa Barbara Dodgers and their dilapidated stands and watching the MLB on TV was like watching grass grow.    Over the last several years I have attended several games and have enjoyed every one.  Well maybe not so much the ones we have lost :-)  I have taken several people new to the park and/or baseball and made the walk around the concourse.  It is always a fun upbeat place to go.  I bring my own water but most often buy a beer and a Diamondbacks dog to get me through the first innings.  A couple of times I have gotten to enjoy the fireworks launched from the parking garage across the street which are very intense for their duration.  I have never been to another MLB park and I am sure some others have more history but to me this is a first class venue to watch Major League Baseball and I look forward to many more visits.  Every interaction I have had with the staff has been first rate.

I love wandering through this place!  Over the years I have been here many times.  Haven't spent much time playing their slots.  Took my sister to a great dinner once at Noodles which is affordable and always has a line.    Some of the must sees:  Just off to the West of the check in area there is a garden which changes themes 3 or 4 times a year with animation ans water jets.  Just West a bit more is a patisserie with a huge chocolate fountain.  I happen to have always eaten just before but the wares are quite tempting, if you can find a place to settle and eat, all the way down the hall seems to fill up any time of day.  And cannot forget the water show out front, the trees have mostly grown up and that stretch of Las Vegas Blvd is a pleasure to walk, even in the summer.

I just didn't get it.  The people/service are great.  Maybe I ordered the wrong menu items for my taste buds but I wasn't that impressed with the food.  And the pork had a bunch of fat.  I had the cookie for mid afternoon snack and it was really good.  They certainly have plenty of fans, there was 20-30 people in line at lunch the whole time I was there.

I chose this restaurant mostly based on the location for ease of getting there from Fountain Hills for somebody who had not been to Arizona before and it's closeness to Sweet Republic.    To get the minor details out of the way.  I was reminded why I prefer tables to booths.  The seating was uncomfortable.  The only  other item was my chopsticks were so warped they were useless and I should have asked for another pair but instead gave up and used my fork.  We chose 3 entrees and all were good.  The serving size was appropriate for the target clientele.  If our group was 20 years younger we would have gone away hungry, as it was we ate about 90% of the food served.   Now what brings the 4th star is the service.  No heat orange chicken with red chile sauce on the side for me: no problem, Plum sauce on the side for the Mu Shu: no problem, Pictures of the group: no problem.  I have had this place bookmarked for some time and now I have been there it will remain on my list of places to go when I want a place to meet folks on the East side.

So Thomas gets bored, or whatever, and decides to do another Foodies event just for Yelpers.  Timing wise it crossed over in to the 5-8 pm time for their regular Foodies event.  The end result is a bunch of us get to enjoy his hospitality and some special items not on the regular menu.  I also got the chance to see some of my Yelp friends and meet a few more.  I started off with a Sam Adams summer ale and the first plate of delicious Hummus and bread came out, I had to stop at 3 if I was going to keep going.  Deb and Monica had a really tempting order of sweet potato fries that they kept ooing and aahing over but I resisted.  Then came a spinach salad with raspberries, walnuts, blue cheese and a vinaigrette of some sort. Then came the entree of grilled flat iron steak, mashed red skin potatoes and asparagus all covered over in a sauce.  To Chad's, our server, credit he described in great detail what was on the plates but I am lucky I remembered the main components.  I finished my gluttony off with a slice of cheesecake topped with some sort of sweet stuff.  I was sure I was going to need help getting to my car.  Thank you Thomas for throwing another really great UYE/foodie gathering!  (edited after learning some new things)

I finally had a Fez burger!  meh.  I went away less than amazed but it was my own fault.  I ordered what was popular rather than what I thought would appeal to my palate.  I had a Fez burger with a side of sweet potato fries.  Both the pears and the bbq sauce were sweet as was the cinnamon on the fries.  For me it was just too much sweet in one dinner.  What I will order next time is a different burger and I was informed I could order the sweet potato fries with just the dipping sauce without the sugar/cinnamon dusting.  And those fries are not the thin soggy ones I had had elsewhere, they are nice and crisp on the outside and stand up quite well on their own.  The burger came out a perfect medium and I did not ask to have it less the cilantro, which I don't care for, so I could have the burger in it's normal form.  I did take the cilantro off the second half.  I happen to like burgers on ciabatta bread so that was fine.   This visit was sort of spur of the moment.  I had found out where I was meeting folks for a couple of drinks that evening did not serve food and I decided food was in order first.  As I was driving across town on Indian School it didn't take me long to realize how close I would be to Fez!  I got there during the last 1/2 hour of happy hour and the parking lot was packed and I started wondering if I was going to be able to sit anywhere.  I was greeted by Thomas, the GM, almost immediately and he asked what kind of atmosphere I wanted and I explained I was just looking to grab a quick burger on the way to someplace.  He found me a spot in a quiet corner that was perfect.  I had my water right away and my server showed up quickly and took my order.  The wait for the food was reasonable, especially just finishing up happy hour.  My server stopped by on a regular basis and Thomas came by just as I was finishing to hear any comments I had.  I went away happy I had chosen Fez for dinner.

I was thirsty and wanted something cold and non alcoholic.  I had an excellent but sort of pricey iced mocha.  I am glad I am not easily tempted by some of the other treats I saw as I could easily have ordered a whole bag of stuff.

I went there a few weeks back for #pfn and it was a great way to start my vacation.  A bowl of balls and a couple of Peroni's were just the ticket.  Considering the size of our group the wait staff did an excellent job.  Because there were at least 6 dogs in our group we were out on the patio with them in what I think was the hottest evening to date this year.  I had never been to a place that welcomed customers dogs so openly and even in the heat the dogs seemed to appreciate it and I think I only heard 2 barks all night.  I liked the atmosphere and wouldn't mind the drive across town again some time.

Ok, the restaurant itself is a 3.5 but the Yelp group I was with brought it up a notch.  I was here for a UYE organized by Dolores G with a full table of 10 great people.  This was the first Dim Sum where I went away full.  Not sure if it was because I am getting more accustomed to the dishes served or the choices made by the folks I was with.  Being a slow eater I have trouble keeping up with the fast pace of Dim Sum.  I did not try a single item I really did not like, though a couple were a bit sweet for my normal taste.  It may well take another ten trips or so before I become actively involved in the food selection.  I finally bowed to pressure and tried the chicken feet, it really was like a tiny piece of fried chicken with little bones that the meat had to be sucked off of.    The service was pretty good although we had some communication problems.  I did not see the one iced tea ever get refilled.  And the carts were moving so fast it took a couple of tries to get more napkins.  The restaurant was clean and tidy except for the hallway to the restrooms which were clean.  The owner stopped by to see how we were doing.  And I now have a blind mouse on my headboard that has to rely on the eyes of the other animals there to "see" what is happening in the bed. :-)

Once each trip to Vegas I splurge for a really nice dinner.  Sometimes I get disappointed, not here,  I showed up just after opening and it wasn't very busy yet.  Not being a fan of prime rib I chose the Filet of beef Oscar ($25).  I always hesitate to order medium rare as many chefs under cook it and it takes a good piece of meat to pull it off.  My waitress convinced me it was ok to order it that way and I was very pleased with the result.  It included a salad, which I had with blue cheese dressing, and my choice of potato, I chose garlic mashed.  I also had a slice of one of the best pieces of cheesecake I have ever had (I think $7).  The only regret I have is the Kendall Jackson glass of wine, I should know better as I have never had a K-J wine I really liked.  A note: a "glass" of wine is really a third of a bottle carafe so it isn't really as expensive as it seems.  Not only was this a great meal, at $44 plus tax and tip it was relatively inexpensive for Vegas.  I noticed a good portion of the diners were locals.

I was first introduced to this mall by friends on a Black Friday a few years back.  Since then I have stopped in at least once a year.  For friends from Phoenix it is about twice as big as the outlets at Anthem and the yet to open Outlets at Westgate, and it is indoors!  While mostly geared towards clothing and accessories there are a few kitchen places and during the holiday season a couple of specialty food stores.  I won't go in to detail about how much money I have spent here over the years. :-)

I have tried 5 different Vietnamese restaurants in the recent past.  This one stands out in my mind as the best of them.  And none of them had any reason not to go back.  For one thing the setting in the old house is great.  And it has a shaded patio out front.  I had a chicken dish with rice which came to my table still at a full boil.  I would have liked to try the egg rolls but 6 in an order would have been a full meal in itself.  The party next to me had an order of spring rolls and egg rolls and their comments were good.  I went in the middle of lunch on a Friday and it was almost at capacity but I was seated right away and there was some delay (maybe 5 minutes) in taking my order but the food came out in a normal time.  As in many Asian restaurants it is a family operation with the son of the owners being my waiter.  Being just over a mile from work I will be back again.    Parking in downtown Glendale can be a hassle at times, less than a block away on the NE corner of 57th Ave. and Glenn Dr is a lot that only gets full during special events. In fact the downtown area is small enough I would park there to go almost anywhere in the area, but I don't mind walking.

I really wasn't in the mood for a buffet so I walked right past the one in the Excalibur on my way to see what Luxor had in the way of a coffee shop.  I wanted food cooked to order for me.  My food came out really fast.  I would be real surprised if any of it did not come from a warming tray.  The eggs were watery, the corned beef hash was dried out, I could only deal with part of the potatoes, the toast served wrapped in a basket was too cold even when it first got there to melt the butter.  The orange juice was really good and the decaf was ok.    The service was good and friendly.  The chairs were comfortable to lounge back in but not very comfortable to sit up to the table in.  Overall I was not really impressed paying $5 more plus tip for the same quality of food I could have gotten from the buffet.

I have been twice since I last wrote a review and can find no excuse for not adding the 4th star.  I went for a Yelp UYE dinner and had a half rack of St Louis ribs with cole slaw and mac and cheese.  Last night I was there in a party of four and had the Smokehouse burger.  That is one of the best $10 burgers I have ever had.  The bun doesn't really hold up well so if you put it down you will end up finishing it with a fork.  Around the table there were ribs, steak and pulled pork.  It was my choice of restaurant and everybody loved their food!  One of our party ordered a Mojito and was told they don't make those there but other than that the drinks were fine.  I have now sampled 3 of their desserts, I didn't care much for the peach cobbler but the banana cream and the chocolate over dose were really good.

One of those places I really meant to get to for a long time.  Got the chance the other evening for an after party. Only real negative: pretty much forced valet, complimentary other than the tip.  No trouble getting seated right about dinner time on a Thursday, they were busy our whole time there. Wile not right at our side the whole time I thought the service was pretty good, and pleasant.  I got a sample of my first choice of beer and glad I didn't go that route but the waitress listened to my comments and made a suggestion which was very good. I had a really good tasting cheeseburger with a side salad. Two of our party shared a pizza and I didn't hear any complaints.

More like a 3.7  I had the corned beef hash with eggs ($12.95), orange juice, decaf.  So the decaf sucked like it usually does.  The rest of my meal was fantastic.  I feel I did pretty good only leaving about half the bag of potatoes and half the biscuit.  This is not an inexpensive place to eat but both the quality and the quantity justify the expense.  If you have wheels in Vegas this is one of those places you have to try.  They also have a location inside the Imperial Palace.  I was seated immediately and the service had gaps in time but not bad for a 3/4 full restaurant.

It has been roughly 20 years since I last ate here.  Over the years Caesers has continued to expand and I did not realize until recently it was still here.  I do not remember the sushi bar out front but it could have been there.  Being a fan of teppan cooking there was no choice as to what part of the restaurant I would dine in.  Upon arrival I asked how long the wait would be without reservations as the last time I ate there they were pretty much mandatory.  I was informed they would seat me right away as there was nobody else coming soon to seat me with.  I must not wear the proper cologne or something as the last 4 times in a row I ended up at a teppan table by myself and part of the experience is the meeting of strangers.  They sat me at a table for 2 which is something I had never seen before in a teppan restaurant.  It would be really cool for an impressive date.  This was a Monday night of a 3 day weekend and it was really dead in there.  My chef, one of 3 I could see on duty, said that most week nights they do a lot of standing around waiting for a table to cook for.  I chose one of their Prix fixe dinners.  First was a bowl of miso soup (chicken soup optional), followed by a cucumber salad with crab meat.  The main course included shrimp, beef tenderloin, a chicken breast and vegetables.  Dessert was ice cream inside of some sort of rice cake, different texture and not too sweet.  The only item I didn't think was prepared to my liking was the fried rice which I thought a bit dry, almost crunchy.  The cost of this meal was $49 plus $6 to upgrade the white rice to fried rice which turned out to be a poor option choice.  I had a glass of Asahi  draft for $10.  For Vegas this was reasonably priced.  The service was excellent up to a point.  That point was when a party of 40 or so showed up and the restaurant went from being a little overstaffed to way understaffed.  As I was eating I noticed a flurry on the other side of the room as water glasses were being filled from water bottles and shortly thereafter the large party started arriving.  Normally I am sure they would not seat that many tables all at the same time with only 3 chefs so I hope they were all in a chatty mood as the last few tables were going to be a while before they saw a chef.  In that rush I sort of got forgotten, it took a while for my plate to be picked up and for the bill to come and another while before the bill got picked up and another wait for my change.  Waiting is sort of a funny thing, it gets blown out of proportion when you are by yourself, which I was. All of the waits I mentioned probably only added 10-15 minutes total to my dining experience and if I was with someone would have been almost unnoticeable..

So Saturday morning I decide to take the trek over to Scottsdale Old Town Farmers Market.  Started the morning off with a drive across Glendale/Lincoln, first time I had taken that route in daylight.  It was a perfect morning with temps in the 70s.  I do not function well with out food/coffee early in the morning and I took this trip as an excuse to try out another restaurant.  I arrived well before opening so I wandered around and got my bearings, arriving at the door promptly at 7AM.  I was the first customer in the door, entering from Indian School, and the place was deserted so I wandered around a bit when somebody came out.  I asked if I could eat on the patio and once she figured out which patio was ready I was told to pick a seat.  This sort of sounds like poor service but it really wasn't, every body was rushing around setting stuff up and total time elapsed was like 3 minutes.  I gather Scottsdale doesn't wake up early, even as I left at almost 8 there were still very few customers.   My server offered up drinks and handed me a menu and in the couple of minutes it took my orange juice to arrive I had made my choice.  Maybe too quick on my part, the menus only get reprinted a couple of times a year and there are items not listed which when I heard them recited to another table sounded enticing.  I had corned beef hash, scrambled eggs, sliced tomatos and and English muffin.  The eggs were nice and hot and not overcooked.  The corned beef hash may be the best I have had in Arizona.  My server checked up on me fairly often.  The restaurant is divided up with an indoor seating area/bar, two outside seating areas divided by the entrance to the parking lot and a meeting room, which I did not see inside, but you could sort of guess where it was by subtracting what you could see from the overall size of the place.  I would pick outside almost any time.  I would not hesitate to return here.  Both the food and the service were excellent.

Went there for dinner on Monday night.  Not real impressed.  The place is not much larger than a Golden Corral.  Being sort of cheap I usually stay at Excalibur and at least once each stay go to the buffet.  Last Christmas I decided to spend an extra $5 and try the buffet at the Luxor and was well rewarded.  So this year I opted to spend yet another $5 ($26.99 +tax) to see what it got me.  Last year at the Luxor was much better.  Very small salad bar. Limited cooked vegetables.  Several meat and starch dishes, almost all were cold or lukewarm.  Several of the seafood items (hot and cold) were soggy.  I did leave room for dessert and it was very good.  This place has all the pieces in place to be good and they just are not pulling it off well.  They have several seafood offerings, they use smaller warming trays so they get changed out more often which should keep food warm and not dried out.  I ate between the opening rush and the 7PM dinner rush so the place was only about 80% full and the lines were reasonable.  My server kept my plates cleared and my Iced tea full.  I did notice this trip the entire MGM family seems to be cutting back on quality and value compared to when I was there in July.

Somebody mentioned the liver and onions here were good.  Didn't take much after that for a small gathering to check it out. They were indeed good.  We also had a couple of shared appetizers. Loved the feel of the place. After the baseball game was over it got sort of quiet which surprised me on a Friday evening. The service was great the whole time. This is a place I wouldn't mind coming back to to try something else on the menu.

When I first came to town in 93 the Realtor showing me commercial rentals took me here for lunch.  And I got a bit of a history lesson of Southwest Phoenix.  I got part of the story about Garcia's becoming a chain and being sold and this one location being bought back.  As he used to own a home where Maryvale High School is I also got a history lesson on John F. Long (whom I later met as a customer) and the build up of the Maryvale neighborhood just to the West of here.  I enjoyed that meal.  Since then I have taken business acquaintances, relatives, dates and friends here.  I have yet to have anyone complain.  It's not so spicy as to turn people off.  The thin chips are always served warm.  They used to serve two salsas, now they only serve the mild except on request.  The food is consistent every time.  The only thing I have ever had I wasn't enamored with was the margarita I once had.  The service is always great except it is consistently hard to get the bill.  They can handle several 10-20 party groups at a time.  During dinner hours they quite often have strolling musicians.  This last time I stopped in for lunch and got the chimichunga lunch special for $8.00 which came with rice and beans and chips and salsa.  I was stuffed.  The food came quickly and was just as I expected.  When I got there about 11:15 there were still plenty of parking spaces, by the time I left at 12:00 the parking lot was packed.  I don't hardly ever give 5 stars and I am pretty sure I wouldn't on a one time visit here but how else can you rate a place you are willing to drive from wherever in the Valley for and not be worried about whether anybody with you will like it.

Marisa's ROTD reminded me I was there for the group hike that day and never reviewed the park.  A few years earlier I had walked on some of the easier parts of the trails and thought it was cool to have a place to hike in the city.  This time I knew I was going up Shaw Butte and as I drove up from the West it seemed that this hill that I drive by on a regular basis had become bigger than life.  I started a bit before the rest of the group and got to the top just before some of the main group and took a bunch of pictures at the top and several others along the way.  The visitor center was clean and staffed by several nice folks that had advice on the trails and hiking the desert in general.  It is now summer and I think I just may wait until fall to make this hike again. ;)

I have been in and out of Caesars many times over the years.  I can almost find my way around :-)  This was my first time I found the pool areas and gardens.  I took a whole bunch of photos I have yet to upload.  My favorite restaurant is Hyakumi.  There are lots of places within the building to take pictures.

This is one of 4 locations I have frequented over the years.  The one on Bell now being closed.  I have always liked the food, mostly going for breakfast but with the occasional lunch tossed in.  This trip around I got a Smokehouse grilled cheese sandwich which has ham, bacon, turkey, tomato, bbq sauce and some cheese.  I was stuffed.  The service was friendly as always.

I was sort of disappointed.  Last week I got a new LG enV3 from Verizon and intended to carry it in the same holster I had been using for my previous phone.  Well it only took me a week to put several scratches in it from grit that accumulated in the holster.  I NEEDED a new plan!  I really don't like standing around the Verizon store for an hour and paying too much to choose from a poor selection.  I looked at Amazon but the few reviews on accessories were poor and I really wanted to see how stuff worked.  My next idea was Walmart but they are not a Verizon reseller so I figured they would not have accessories for the Verizon specific LG phones.  So I Googled cell phone accessories and up popped Wireless Toyz.  Checking Yelp I found one 5 star review from Chrissy.  Their website states they deal with all the major carriers and the Verizon logo is clearly displayed.  No trouble finding the place.  When I walked in there were a family and two other folks in front of me, all but one of them were already being waited on.  As I am looking around the well stocked store for stuff for my phone I heard the guy rep telling the family they don't deal with Verizon because they are too expensive.  She was looking to add 2 new lines of unlimited usage to an existing 2 lines and move to Prescott. He was trying to sell her on switching to Sprint.  Have no idea where that went as I continued to move around the store.  Sure enough I found no Verizon specific phones and no accessories for them either.    So my turn comes around and I get the lady rep.  She happens to be using an LG enV2, my guess is Verizon.  I told her I was looking for something to protect my screen and she sorta of gives me the lost stare because they do not deal with Verizon.  I skipped even asking about a car charger because I knew that my warranty was void if I used a generic charger as some of them cause overheating of the battery.  On to the next question: I have a Jawbone II headset and many reviews mention switching to a Jabra earpiece.  Even though I forgot the brand name she reached in a drawer and pulled them out and indeed they were the newer universal model and they did fit but it was the only set she had ever seen and they were in an unmarked bag (probably rescued from a Jabra headset) and she could not sell them to me because she had no SKU.  By this time I had quite a line behind me and was batting zero when she remembers seeing one accessory to fit my phone on the back wall.  Turns out to be a Body Glove and after playing with it, is exactly what I was looking for.  So they get one star for existing and having a pleasant sales reps and one for having one of the items I was shopping for.  If you are shopping for hardware for one of the carriers they cover, I have never seen so much stuff in one place.  Otherwise find a different store.

So, three years and two more trips here later I need to update this review.  I did not go here with my Droid 2 but have been in a couple of times with my Bionic.  First trip in I was looking for the extended life battery and a case.  This was not to long after phones starting getting big and if I went the big battery my choice of cases was zero.  What they did have was an Otterbox Defender which sort of surprised me as it is a dedicated case system peculiar to a Verizon phone.  As to the battery, I got an external quick charge system that lives in my car door pouch.  In the two+ years that had passed at that time the owner had dedicated one of his stocking walls to Verizon products acknowledging their large share of the Phoenix marketplace.  And he had convinced the parent company to put a disclaimer about not all carriers listed are carried in all market areas.  After my transaction was done I introduced myself to the owner/franchisee and we talked for a bit.  He remembered my first review as he had contacted me shortly thereafter.  Last week I managed to break my Otterbox.  I knew it was under warranty but I had issues about the convenience of the size when I did not want to use the holster.  It had protected the phone well in a couple of drops.  What I asked about was a screen protector and a standard magnetic closure holster.  As usuall the salesman who helped me was friendly and knew what he had.  They had several choices of holsters and for $5 I got a screen protector installed for when I just wanted to put the phone in my pocket.  A good solid 3.5+.  And the owner of 2 stores is a nice guy that really is customer service oriented.  And if he doesn't have what you want in stock he can usually order it for you.

I was thinking this would be quicker than going to my normal one on Northern.  It may be a bit closer but getting back out of the parking lot on to Camelback West bound takes forever.  That's not the reason for the loss of a star.  I ordered one of my favorite burgers, a bacon guacamole six dollar burger.  I got it to go with a side salad and a small drink ($7.89 as a combo).  I should have known something wasn't quite right when my order was up faster than I could fill my drink at the fountain.  The meat was very well done and not very hot.  A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.  The bright spot in this was the staff.  I was greeted before I could get to the counter by everyone except the cook.  And on my way out I was thanked for coming in by the manager and two other staff.  Fast food is nice but if by getting really fast the quality goes away you haven't gained anything.  I may give them another chance but not much further away is another location that has always gotten it right.

I am glad the place I bought my bike closed down.  It pushed me in to finding a bike shop that actually stocked accessories and stuff and knows what service is all about instead of the bike shop that was on my way home.  I don't ride very many miles so most of my needs as of late have been tire fixes.  They are fast and reasonable.  And have answered my questions about other issues right away no matter whom I have talked to.  And they have business hours a working person can deal with.  I intend to keep coming back here!

This is the first time in many years I have stopped here.  I did at one point have some exceptional customer service the one time I needed help but overall I just don't care for this location as well as a couple of others.  Today the check out was more trouble than it needed to be and the person manning the self check was just sort of kicking back and not helping those who needed it and she only had one of the four check out points operational to cover.

There are times when you need a fried chicken fix and over the years KFC is the place I turn to most often.  I always get original recipe and usually mac and cheese and cole slaw.   I have been to this location a few times.  Here the entire kitchen is open and they always seem disorganized.  In the dining room one of the trash containers was full to the point stuff was spilling out on to the floor.  One patron had to call her friend on her cell to ask at the counter for toilet paper.  I am sure I will go here again in the future because there are the closest KFC to work but I am glad I don't need a greasy fried chicken fix often these days.

3.5 stars, this is one of the rare occasions I decided to round up instead of down.  After having a couple of Papusas at restaurant #3 on Central during the art walk I had been meaning to get back and try some more stuff.  So today I finally decide I am willing to make the drive over from Glendale and check the website and realize this location is really much closer.  I gave up the opportunity to try the buffet, which is only at the #3 location, for the convenience of the shorter drive.  This location is at the end of a strip mall in a part of town where English is not necessarily spoken or understood.  I walk in to the well lit and brightly painted restaurant and am greeted by the waitress, bus person, cashier.  It goes like this;  her:Hola Me: Hi her: Habla Espanol o Ingles? me: I don't speak Spanish her: (look of horror in her eyes as she realizes we will not communicate well) Are you taking out or eating here? (In Spanish) me: (the only word I understood was aqui) I am eating here and points to row of tables. her: Waves me to toward a row of tables, obviously inviting me to pick one.  She brings me a menu and points out the Papusas and I point to one of the entrees, not having read the descriptions, on the menu and ask of those things with the entrees are also Papusas and she informs me they are tortillas.  I ordered onion chicken ($9.95)and a medium Horchata ($1.75).  In El Salvador Horchata is made from Morro seed rather than rice which gives it a different flavor than the more common version found in Mexican places.  Let me assure you it is still a tasty drink.  I thought the chicken breast was a bit tough but it was quite tasty.  The meal comes with rice, beans and tortillas all of which are different than their Mexican counterparts.  The tortillas are the same biscuity type used to make Papusas and are really great at sopping up the juices from the onions and sauce.  I left full and happy.  I never heard a word of English spoken in the building but it did not provide any barriers to ordering/eating.  We each understood just enough of each others language to communicate.  When I went to pay the bill there was a manager in the door way to the kitchen and it was my guess she was bi-lingual and could have translated.  There was a steady usage of about 4-5 tables the whole time.    While Salvadoran food is not real common in the states it certainly rates an additional choice to add to the list of ethnic restaurant options.  And it is affordable.  There were several items on the menu without meat.  If you are gong to use an online menu the PDF version is much more accurate as to description but you will want to print it out as it is sideways on the monitor.

This review is only for eating lunch at the in store restaurant.  I got back from my rounds just in time for a customer from out of town to suggest we go to lunch.  He had been here several times and suggested it.  We placed our orders, he had the half chicken combo and I ordered the chicken fajita combo, then went and got our drinks.  I couldn't pass up the horchata which I think is one of the better ones around.  We selected a table and waited, and waited.  After what seemed like quite a while we went back to the counter and were told they were out of chicken fajitas for the day so they had just held up both our meals and not called out to us.  What???  Anyway I changed my order to enchiladas and we got our food fairly quickly after that.  My lunch ended up not coming with the tortillas or the salad that is supposed to come with the combos but I had plenty to eat as it was.  The enchiladas were filled with crema fresca and topped with green sauce and were ok and the beans were topped with cotija cheese.  At $4.99 each the meals were a good value, too bad about the service as I took off a star for it.

I cannot believe I have never checked in or reviewed this place before. For 18 years they have been taking care of my flat tires and I have been buying all of my tires here.  This being Arizona, land of the flat tire, I always get the road hazard warranty and both my son and I have come out ahead!

This place is CLOSED  R.I.P.  This place was right down the street from me in the Safeway shopping center.  The only sandwich I ever had there was one containing avocado.  The mashed avocado was really brown and bad tasting.  The overall sandwich was not that great and I didn't care for the potato salad.  I never went back.  Last night I stopped next door at GNC and the place was cleared out.

Apparently this place has reopened in Surprise.  And it is now reflected on their website, which it didn't before.  I still wouldn't go there because I didn't like the food but maybe I caught them on a bad day.

I think they have some of the best corned beef around.  I have been here several times. Sometimes the line can get a bit long.  My opinion is it is a definite step up from the food court.  They may not be the best Jewish deli around but they are one of the better places to get a sandwich in the West valley.  I was in there again yesterday and got a corned beef on sourdough with potato salad ($7.95).  They tend to push their fries which are ok but I like to try different stuff.  The potato salad was ok, but I saw several of the fruit cups and wish I had gotten on of them instead.  I had more on my plate than I could finish.

Was here for a Breakfast Club UYE.  What a wonderful setting for breakfast.  Not many menu choices but we all found something to eat and nobody had any complaints about how it came.  Our waitress was very nice.  After our meal several of us strolled around the farm grounds.

Other than the weirdness of the levels, this is how I think a mall should be. Vegas is a shop til you drop town, but most malls either cater to the budget conscious or the money is no object crowd.   Whether you are shopping for food, clothes, jewelry or some other things there are several price ranges represented.  Because of that, and parking is off of Spring Mountain instead of the strip it fronts, locals shop here as well as tourists.  Even to tourists it draws from all the three other corners.(Wynn/Encore, Venetian/Palazzo, Treasure Island).  Bonus points: Sur la Table is there:-)

I noticed I had a low tire on the way in to town so I looked for a Discount Tire and found one just down the street. In and out in less than two minutes. One of the reasons Discount had been getting all my tire business for many years.

For some reason I did not expect this place to be busy for lunch on a weekday. I was way wrong, arriving almost at 1 I still had a wait and almost an hour later as I left there was still a wait. After the food and the service I understand why. And my wait was only about 10 minutes, parties of more than 4 took longer but they are pretty good at turning tables. The only pause was after I ordered and finished my soup until my entree arrived which was still prompt considering how many customers they had. I had my go to, red curry with chicken, and I liked their take on it. On top of that I liked that the meal came with salad and a bowl of soup. And it was reasonably priced. Definitely would be a regular stop if I lived in the area.

I attended a CMYE here to watch the LV 51s (Toronto AAA affiliate).  After reading up in advance about the stadium being outdated, run down, etc. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a facility that was clean and in good repair.  Sure it is no Chase field but I found it to be a good venue to watch a game.  I noticed there was a group of folks tailgating before the game even though it was about as hot and humid as Vegas gets.  Food and drink was reasonably priced.  Restrooms were clean and not worn out.  I would definitely come here again.

So here it was July 4th and my intention was to do a buffet for lunch.  All the buffets I checked out had either long lines or higher holiday prices or both.  As I was wandering along the canal in the Venetian a couple of hostesses were handing out to go copies of the menu to try and get folks inside.  I wandered a bit more and came back.  I was led to the back of the street side bar/restaurant told I could walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The seats with the view were being utilized by couples but my seat wasn't bad.  Most of the menu is price fixed with 3 courses for lunch or 5 courses for dinner.  I chose a Caesar salad, chicken parmigiana, and it came with a small desert and coffee.  The food was really good and the service was excellent.

Yesterday I found myself at Switch for the second time in as many months.  I had been told by several people that happy hour/appetizers and brunch were their strong suits and after doing both I can agree they are certainly top notch although I have yet to try them for lunch or dinner.  Both times the food, service and drink specials were great and my companion both times wants to duplicate the patio at her own house.  I don't remember all the appetizers we sampled on our first trip but for brunch we shared a quiche and a Gallete and both were really good and we were stuffed, the $3 carafe of Bloody Marys certainly did nothing to ruin our mood.

I had a discount coupon as a guest in the hotel and decided to try them out for a breakfast.  My choice that morning was chicken fried steak and eggs ($8.99), a large orange juice ($3.49)and a cup of decaf.  When will I learn not to order scrambled eggs in a casino cafe, they came from a big pan of eggs.  The rest of the meal was just acceptable.  The service was sort of weird where nobody seemed to know what their job was in relation to the rest of the staff.  I wouldn't rule them out for another visit but I sure wouldn't go out of my way to go there again.

This was my second time going up.  The first was a few years back and we went up late in the evening.  It took 2 hours in line and when we got up there there was a storm blowing in and the fountains had been shut off and we were one of the last to get up.  Basically it was miserable.  This time I was out on the strip early in the day and went up just after they opened.  There was nobody in front of me for the elevator up and very few folks when I got up there.  I took lots of pictures and even figured out how to take video with my phone of the fountains at Bellagio which normally do not start until later in the day.  Definitely one of those things to do when in Vegas.

I have had this place bookmarked for my last three trip to Vegas and I finally got here.  It is hard to find in the dark, even harder to park as it is on the street at the end of an industrial complex.  It is right across to the East from Chinatown Mall which also has parking problems during prime eating hours.  My initial attraction to this place was from reviews by a few of my friends.  When I checked in I was impressed to find Misti, the Vegas CM, is the Duchess of this place.  I chose a Thai iced tea to drink.  Even in my limited experience it was only OK but not great.  It got better from there.  As an appetizer I ordered shrimp rolls ($5.95) which were 6 large shrimp in a roll and deep fried with a peanut sauce.  For my entree I chose Rad-na with chicken.  It was very good but I feel I cheated myself of some flavor by ordering it mild rather than 3 or 4 on the spice scale.  It is definitely a hole in the wall with basic decor.  The service was really great and the two young women were on top of their game while still being able to kid around with the regulars, it is a very comfortable place to visit.   While I was there both a sit down customer and a take out customer mentioned they had driven past the second location to go there because they did not like the food there as well.  I am sure by the comments that they are trying very hard to make them indistinguishable,  I very much enjoyed my dinner here.

This is a beautiful facility right on the West end of Tempe town lake. I have gone to two presentations by Childsplay this season and have liked both. Childsplay is theater geared towards grade school aged children to give them an early love of live theater.  I got my love of it working stage crew in junior high and high school. Both of the shows I attended were in the main theater. There are no bad seats in the house including the second balcony. In addition to Childsplay there are other arts presentations throughout the year.  Truely a first class facility!

I was supposed to meet up this night  with a fellow Yelper to go somewhere else and she got sick so I stayed in the casino and decided to eat here.  I really liked the Boston clam chowder and the side salad was pretty good too.  For my entree I had the shrimp scampi over linguini.  It is pretty good too but with the clam chowder and salad it really needs to be shared by 2 people.  The service was good up until the point the server "forgot" to include the discount coupon I had, which he acknowledged up front, and I made him go back and re-do the ticket which then took forever.  I would definitely go back for a light dinner of the soup and side salad.

I picked this place as a Sunday motorcycle ride destination based on a friend's description of a yummy sounding macaroni and cheese burger. It being Mothers day never crossed my mind. I'm going to cheat a little and copy my FB post from when I got home.  "My visit to San Tan brewery was mostly negative. There is motorcycle parking right by the door. I passed by a 60 minute wait because I was a party of one. Then I found out the only food available until 3PM was a $25 buffet. OK, Ill try it after taking over an hour to get there. These people had no clue how to run a buffet. There was food burned to the bottom of several chafing dishes and the guy at the carving station had no clue how to get slices or even chunks of meat from a spiral sliced ham. 12 food items and 4 dessert items. Not worth anything near $25. This was their second run at this, first was Easter. The place was packed though."  I will go out of my way to never be there for a special day again. That aside, my food was OK, my waitress was a sweetheart and my beer was really good. I have several friends who speak highly of the place so my intention is to go back in the fall and try the Marzen and the burger I couldn't get.

Really 3.5 stars rounded up.  I was there on a Friday evening for a birthday party.  We had a space reserved near the fire pit outside and other than using the restroom just inside the door I never saw the inside of the place.  The patio was large enough there were two parties going on and still several tables left, which being a beautiful evening most were in use.  We had brought a cake and they were nice enough to provide a knife and plates/forks for us.  Our waiter is where the 4th star was earned.  He never wrote anything down,  I did not hear that he screwed up any orders for our party of 15 or so.  He was very familiar with every item on the food and drink menu.  In addition to a coupleof beers I had a fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil panini ($10) which was very good and came with a bowl of chips.  .When it came time for us to go he already had the checks split.  Because of our party size there was a gratuity already added and I am willing to bet I wasn't the only one that added some more.  Two things that cost them 1/2 star. They were out of the only dark beer on the list.  That didn't bother me as I wanted a Pilsner anyway but there were at least 2 in our party that wanted the dark beer and had to settle for something else.  The parking sucks.  There are like 9 parking spots for a bar that could have close to 100 people including employees.  The parking spilled over into the business next door and down the side streets and behind another restaurant down the street.  I would hate to own a house close to here.

This place is amazing.  They change the whole garden every season and for some holidays.  It is always one of my first stops when I visit the strip.  If there is a drawback, it is the place is no longer much of a secret and it is packed.

I am a big fan of teppan grills. For many years my favorite in Vegas had been Mizuno's which closed down a few years back shortly after the kids took it over.  It had already started to decline somewhat in popularity amongst the locals.  I had tried a few in town and settled on Hyakumi, although a bit pricy, as the best of the bunch on the strip.  Well that is now closed too, Caesars is going to make a new restaurant concept in the place after over 25 years.  Based on a couple of my Yelp friends reviews I had bookmarked this place off the strip several years ago.  Well I was on an eating frenzy this trip and made it over here.  If you are not a fan of community table eating of any kind then find someplace else.  At least 90% of the time I have enjoyed my table companions and this was no exception.  The food and the show were great!  And reasonably priced for what it is, expect $50-90 depending on what you order with a single glass of beer or wine and tax+tip.  If you want an adult themed show go late to avoid the family crowd.  I got lucky and, even though it was early. there were no young kids at the tables so the young cook was playing to the 20 something ladies I was sharing the table with.  They stay open to 4AM to cater to the crowd that works on the strip.  This is a place worth staying sober to drive to and from or paying the taxi fare!

I came to visit in late December and it was sort of chilly.  As such, other than a few groups of school kids, I had the place almost to my self.  To take in the entire property and all it has to offer takes a good 3-4 hours and I am sure I still missed some stuff.  While in the gardens I got to spend some time with the curator and chat about vegetable gardening in a desert and she let me peek out back as see her little compost pile, almost as long as a football field!  She was excited about having just gotten a permit from the city to start growing vegetables for the cafe.  The permit required that that garden be kept out of he public area but I am sure photos will be on display somewhere after it is in production.  In addition to the gardens there are several indoor areas with lots of interactive stuff for people of all ages.  Areas focus on wildlife, water conservation, and lots of historical info on the area.  If you have kids in tow while visiting Vegas this is a must do side trip.

I wanted to go on a motorcycle ride and knew about where I wanted to stop for lunch so I yelped the Zip code for "lunch".  This was one of the places that showed up. Folks that have dined with me several times know I do not care for booths, I just don't like sinking into the average booth where quite often the table feels too high in relation to the seat. As I walked in the door the waitress at the back of the room held up her index finger asking if I was a party of one. I nodded my head and she pointed towards a booth. I could tell looking at her that asking for a different seating choice in her restaurant would not go well. To my pleasant surprise the booth had nice firm seats and the relationship of the table to the seat was very good. I had a lunch special which came with appetizers and was a very generous portion for the price. The service was good. I would certainly consider going back if I was again in the area.

That has got to be one of the coolest patios in town for a get together.  I was another of the Yelp group (and friends) in attendance last night for happy hour.  We had a long table reserved for us.  The bartender was also our waiter for the evening.  To my knowledge, with all of us moving around, I don't think he screwed up a single order of food or drink.  The manager, Matt, came by to check on us several times.  I arrived fairly early and before I was tempted to work my way through multiple baskets of the wonderful bread and pesto I ordered a serving of crab cakes.  They were quite good, certainly not enough volume to replace an entree.  I was offered several choices of pizza slices and accepted a bruscetta one which was delicious.  Of the many pizzas ordered I did not hear one person that was less than satisfied.  I do of sort regret not trying the white pizza but I was at that not full but no longer hungry point where I should, but don't always, stop.  We did cause one hiccup in the evening, many of us decided it was time to go at the same time and with all the separate bills to figure out at once it swamped the entire staff to the point a couple of people at the bar complained they couldn't get a drink.  Most of the night we ordered as individuals or pairs as we saw fit so we never overwhelmed the kitchen or the server.  I have yet to figure out why groups of people (non business) that are going to be there for a couple of hours anyway have to all order and get served at the same time.  We must have at least looked like we were well behaved, Matt invited us back.

This is my third time attending.  Each time has been with different folks which changes how the venue is seen.  I am sure this will not be my last.  Due to forecasted inclement weather many of the stalls were empty and the attendance was light.  Still had a good time though.

This was the first peak I successfully walked up in Arizona.  I was with a group of Yelpers of just about every physical condition and we all made it to the first summit.  I actually made it about halfway up the next smaller hill and at least half the group made it all the way to the end and back.  The views were worth it.  Considering how many people walk this trail it is maintained in really good shape.  The parking lot isn't big enough but that seems to be the case with every hill in the valley.  The wide street leading in to the park has enough parking to just about double the available.

I met some friends here for Saturday brunch.  It really wasn't that crowded but they were busy.  Inside is hard to configure for large groups and they don't take reservations.  We ended up with the large high top in the middle and it was just the right size.  Service was on spot the entire time.  We even had one person coming late, I think it drug out to about a half hour :), and we were not rushed into ordering.  We did end up not waiting to order.  I had the salmon cake Benedict and it was delicious.  I did not hear any complaints about the food from the table.  Forgot to take a picture until it was about 2/3 consumed. :(    Definitely a place I would return to.

When I was a little kid in Santa Barbara there were a couple of times the family went out for ice cream.  I say went out with tongue in cheek, I was raised in a household where kids were to be seen and not heard, and not seen often.  Back then it was quite a drive from the Mesa to McConnell's at Mission and State.  We were left in the car and were only told the only flavors were chocolate, vanilla and strawberry.  Even then I could tell the difference between good ice cream and the 19 cent/half gallon stuff we normally got at the store.  As I grew older I talked my grandmother into taking me there for special occasions.  Then I was introduced to ice cream parlor itself.  I was still only allowed to have two tasting spoons but I got to choose my own flavor.  I finally made it into high school and one summer a friend was dating one of the servers and I was trying to date (unsuccessfully, for about 4 yrs) her younger sister so we spent quite of bit of time at the ice cream parlor and found if you tasted about 6 flavors you basically got a free scoop of ice cream.  When the owner was in back making ice cream flirting/flavor spoon abuse was kept in check.  The owner was a really nice guy and would come up front to help serve when it got busy.  Later on I happened to live across from him and found out more as an adult how nice of a guy he really was.  To this day I judge ice cream by the rich creamy flavors in his case.  The years have gone by, there is now a corporate office downtown, the ice cream parlor has moved a couple of blocks away and McConnell's ice cream can be found in stores in the area. Tasting spoons have gotten a lot smaller.  In addition the the high milk fat flavors there are now lighter flavors and sorbets as folks try to eat better.  I had met Jan and Helen at a UYE a week prior and had already heard of Sweet Republic from the reviews.  While we eating we got into a round table discussion of how some businesses are identified by their owners as much as the product.  Case in point to start the discussion was Pizzaria Bianco and it spread to my business as well as Sweet Republic and others.    I took advantage of being on the East side of the valley for another UYE to stop in.  I was, of course, recognized and at the time I walked in was the only customer at the counter.   I got to try some flavors and made a choice which I took out and devoured on the bench outside.  Being by the door I could still hear remnants of conversation going on and everybody was treated like family.  So if you are in the East Valley and want great ice cream and other desserts along with great service from people who love what they are doing you need to stop in.  You might even get served up a memory too.  The next question is: why only 4 stars?  They lose a half star for being almost an hour away and another half star for being too health conscious.  My ideal of ice cream includes the rich heavy ice creams I grew up with and I just don't feel as guilty eating here. :-)  (edited 2/5/09)

So for 4 years I have made it a point to stop by here anytime I am on the East side.  Even went to the farmers market a couple of times when 59 Chev was running and have stopped at Whole foods at Tatum and Shea to pick up a pint or two.  Having missed their peach ice cream the last two summers I scheduled my day around making a special trip across town for ice cream.  I was not disappointed and the woman working the counter recognized me as a semi regular customer.  I guess I better bump them up to 5 stars if I am willing to spend more on gas than the double scoop of peaches and cream that I enjoyed on the patio.

Sunday brunch. Yep, it's expensive. You want to show off for a date, celebrate an important family or friend event, it would be worth every penny. The quality and atmosphere may be the absolute best buffet in the valley.

So I found myself in the next city over for a  UYE Tuesday night and needed to pick up some bread on the way home.  It didn't make any sense to drive to the Wal-Mart I usually go to 5 miles the other side of my place.  First off I tried to second guess how to get in the parking lot headed West on Bell and made 2 wrong left turns off Bell and back on and then ended up almost running over some poor folks in a hotel parking lot.  But I got there.  So I get inside and find it is one of the latest floor plans, pretty much like the one at 75th and Peoria which I was only in once, so I can't find anything.  This store has brown colored cement floors instead of white linoleum so even though there is plenty of lighting it looks darker.  And the aisles are a little narrower to begin with.  I get to the bread aisle and the only bread that has an empty spot on the 30+ feet of shelves is the one I want.  :-(  So I choose another similar bread and fill the rest of my list and find lines at each register.  Because this time all the items on my list were grocery items I cannot really comment on the rest of the store.  I am just glad the one I normally go to is a nicer experience.

Last evening was my second time eating here.  Both times I was there for the Sunnyslope art walk.  The first rime I had papusas and this time I had onion chicken and a horchata.  The chicken was fork tender.  I thought they were pretty good with service considering the crowds. I have had the pleasure of sitting with several Yelpers each time and I don't think any one of them ever complained about the taste of the food which is pretty good as Salvadoran food is not near as common as Mexican.

OK, I popped my Whole Foods cherry.  I did not understand this is a flagship location until after my visit and was totally blown away and found it to be easily twice the size I was expecting.  My plan was to get a cup of coffee and some pastries and then stroll Town Square where I had never been before.  Because I wanted to see everything it took me almost half an hour to get over to where the sell pastries and coffee.  They just don't have some prepared food items, within the store they have a whole food court.  And three different areas to eat.  Gazing at some of the fresh produce and meats I would definitely overspend my food budget if one of these was convenient to me.  The fresh baked pastries were very good but I got the standard house blend coffee and was unimpressed.

I have been to several UYE's but this was my first office hours so it almost makes it an OYE.  I got to meet several folks I had not met before and see others that I had.  The nice thing about Yelp events is for the most part they are filled with people who really want to be there rather than having to be there because of work or family or some other obligation.  Gabi is a wonderful hostess.  Not familiar with where I was going I made parking harder to find than I needed to.  I passed on the tequila as I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one, and I had to navigate home.  I had a great time.  Thanks Gabi for putting it together.

If I compare t what I grew up with in Santa Barbara it is a 2 but would not be in any way fair.  I got there over an hour before they opened so I had time to go for breakfast and walk around Old Town.  Got there right at 8 and the first stop was McClenden farms where I got zucchini and yellow crookneck that had been picked when they were supposed to and tomatoes and green onions.  I later saw some really nice bennings green tint at another booth but already had enough squash.  I got a couple jars of preserves at Terra Verde.  Terra Verde will be there only sporadically for the rest of the season.  A loaf of sourdough from Arizona Bread company.  And of course Sweet Republic.  I knew this is the time of year for Peach ice cream but in case I did not make it over for some reason I did not call ahead of time to make sure that was one of the flavors loaded on the truck.  As Helen started down the list I stopped her at peach.  :-)  I am planning on making the trek across the valley once more before the end of the season.  This coming Saturday is planned to be the first underground.

So Wednesday evening I needed milk and cat food. On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.  Chinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.  There was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.

When I first moved to Arizona in 1993 it was the first time in my life I had no outside influence on how I could wear my hair.  So I let it grow and kept it about halfway down my back which was something I could maintain by myself.  By the time I was 50 something it was getting to the point I didn't have enough hair left to pull that off gracefully and I wasn't about to be one of those folks I had seen with all 4 strands of remaining hair in a pony tail.  So in the summer of '04 I cut it off.  Then began my quest for a barber.  I am impatient about some things and standing/sitting in line is one of them.  I usually have help on Fridays so I can leave work and get a haircut and grab lunch.  Being able to go when others are at work lessens the wait.  I tried several places near work, moving further away each time and could not find anyone who understood what I wanted.  I don't speak Spanish and that was a problem quite often too.  Then a customer said he had been going to a Great Clips near him for several years and he was happy.  So I saw one near my apt. and even though it was a bit of a drive from work it also gave me an excuse to grab Chipotle for lunch.  :-)  I have been going there for about 3 years now.  I usually have Tammie cut my hair but it's not a big deal to have one of the other women do it, most of them have been there the whole time I have been going there.  I have only had one bad haircut and that stylist was not only grumpy I never saw her there again.  Location note:  Great Clips says it is 59 Ave at Thunderbird.  The building is really 59th Ave. and Eugie and the parking lot can be entered off of Eugie.

I do not drink a lot of coffee any more.  My friend Arlin B recommended this place and it is next door to the post office where I drop my Netflix rentals.  No matter when you go in the staff is very friendly and the place just smells good.  While I have had Kona coffees I prefer (notably of late at Hulas) I have chosen the Molokai blend here as my favorite.

So my driver was going to be in the area of 31st Ave and Indian School and I gave her an order to pick up at Haps.  Well Haps isn't there any more, the web site still shows the original East side location, and she mentioned she thought another bbq place had moved in where Tom's had closed up a while back.  She called and read the menu to me and said it looked like everything was still in place from when it was Tom's.  I ordered a large beef/pork combo sandwich and a side of beans.  Quote from their menu "We've been told many times more meat falls off our BBQ sandwich than most places put on theirs."  I've seen more meat on an Arby's regular roast beef and Arby's regular bun might even be bigger.  It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't as good as Tom's that used to occupy the building and no where near the level of Hap's or Honey Bears.  The beans had almost a burnt secondary taste to them.   They get 2 stars instead of one just because it was edible.  But I am still hungry.

Ever since El Paso closed down I have been looking for ribs I like as well.  I found them!    I was surprised the place was as quiet as it was early on a Saturday evening.  I was informed by my date that Cave Creek businesses suffer in the summer as many folks willing to drive that far out of Phoenix will drive the extra hour to Prescott and the cooler temps.  I had the ribs and my date had the brisket and we both chose beans and cole slaw.  She really liked the brisket but I thought it was a bit dry and we both needed to use sauce on it.  We really loved the ribs and beans! The cole slaw seemed a bit flat in taste but I think it would have been hard to stand up against the bold flavors of the rest of the dinner, in any case it was certainly fresh and had no off flavors.  Be careful of the iced tea machine.  The 3 labels are: unsweetened black, Sweet tea and Green tea.  We both made the assumption the green tea would be unsweetened only to find out it was very sweet.  The counter service was pleasant.  The place was clean.  The only restrooms were in an outside walkway and served the entire building.  I was surprised they close at 8 on the weekends.  I would like to go back in cooler weather and set out on the patio.

Usually when the cashier informs you the menu is out of date it means what you wanted to order is no longer available or the price went up.  Not so this time, they are still in the mode of adjusting to initial customer comments and the $9 omelet now includes one side AND a bread.  That brings the price point in line with what I consider a regular breakfast choice instead of a special occasion breakfast.  None of that would matter if the food wasn't good.  I had the western omelet with english muffin and bacon.  The bacon is cherry wood smoked and a perfect firm but not crispy.  The omelet had ham, peppers and grilled onions.  And the muffin came with real butter.  I almost forgot to take a picture before I dug in.  All of the food and coffee was good.  I got there at 6:01 and was greeted with a smile.  She did admit she has to work at being a morning person.  I had the entire place to myself until just before I left.  My food was out very quickly.  Thanks to Donny T's review I remembered to grab my table service before the food arrived.  I even found the place headed south without becoming a traffic hazard.  Scramble shares the building with Il Posto.  At the time of the morning I am about it isn't hard to get there and get to work.  Even though it is a ways away I am sure I will find my way back again.

While I have never stayed overnight here I have spent many hours in the building and had refreshments.  They keep this place clean and the staff is always very nice.  The first year it opened I took the time to visit the conference areas with their wide open halls and plantings just outside all the glass.  There are a couple of places upstairs where you can see some of the recycled beams from the prior buildings on the property.  MGM used everything they could from the old buildings in the building of City Center.

Last night I attended a comedy night in the lounge.  I enjoyed the comics although I think they might have been better in a different venue.    All of the employees I came in contact with were very pleasant and intent on providing a peasant environment too watch the show.   However there were tons of miscues.  Folks were either not getting their orders in a timely basis or, in the case of waters or drinks were getting double orders delivered.  Also folks who ordered food by the time of the first act did not get their orders until the 4th or 5th act.  I am not sure whether it was due to an in improper system or whether nobody was expecting a sold out crowd.  A few of things made it hard to enjoy the show:  The extra drama caused by the folks either not getting their orders in a timely basis, the music coming through the doors adjoining the lounge and the overhead lighting in the South end of the lounge being controlled by the music in another part of the restaurant.  Even still I may be tempted to go here again as I do enjoy a glass of wine and some jazz.

This corner (SW corner of 51st Ave and Peoria) has had a gas station on it for years.  Every few years it got a new coat of paint and a different brand name sign went up.  Nothing fancy, 3 rows of pumps, rest rooms in the corner of the lot, pay station/minimal snack bar in the center.  Last year they tore it out about the same time the city was making "improvements" to the intersection.  They even pulled the old fuel tanks and started from scratch.  Seeing as how my normal station was getting hard to get to (that "improvements" thing again) I was happy to see it was a Chevron station.  And on a direct path to work.  Some of the things that make it a less than optimal stop for fuel are compromises between what the city wanted for the public and the property owners right to make a profit.  The city took a right hand turn lane on the North and a Bus pull out on the East side of the property.  And they added landscape easements for aesthetics.  The property owners wanted a store and a car wash in addition to just selling fuel.  There is only like 3 parking spots not on the island or by the propane so store customers quite often park on the islands.  The turning radius' are based on no vehicles sticking out past either end of the pump islands.  Twice I have had to jump the curb and drive over the landscaping with my truck.  Hey, the city bought into it and approved the plans.  The car wash proved to be easier to navigate around the back than I thought, but only when the entrance is not blocked by a delivery truck or customer.  Which it often is.  Aside from the physical problems.  You get 10 cents a gallon off of your gas if you buy a car wash but the car wash is $2 more than my normal place so I need to buy 20 gallons to break even.  Quite often I cannot find a working scrubber/squeegee thing.  And what is with the TV's?  Half of which don't work anyway after the first couple of months.  I'd much rather have soft rock music like my preferred station has.  A few times I have gone in to buy coffee or snacks and the service at the counter has been fine and the inside of the building clean.

Rare for me I went twice before writing a review.  The first time I went I got their club sandwich which was ok but I wanted to try their Philly cheese steak which is their signature sandwich.  The place is still nice and shiney and the employees are constantly cleaning the place.  Their opening rush of business seems to have tapered off a bit but it was still fairly busy with dine in and take out orders.  Both times I was there about 7PM.  I already mentioned the MJ Club was ok.  The lemonade was really good.  The second time I was there I got the little lemon pie which looked small but was plenty for a dessert and really tasty.  I got the philly cheese steak and the insides with peppers, onions, mushrooms was really good.  It comes with a fork and knife but I forged ahead and ate it like a sandwich and ended up wearing part of it, again.  Where they failed was the bun,  it may have been fresh a couple of days before but not by the time I go to it.  The on table BBQ sauce helped and made for an interesting overall taste but the bread just killed it.  Price wise they are ok but with a drink I was up about $12 each time which is at the high end of what I consider fast food.

I am getting to this a bit late as I was there in December.  After strolling around the preserve for several hours I had worked up an appetite.  When I think of Wolfgang Puck I think of celebrity chefs restaurant's where I could no way afford to eat.  While not being cheap I found this place to be affordable.  I was also a little gun shy of a $13 burger having gone to the Burger Bar earlier in the week for a high priced ok burger.  My first impression was the bun was a little too heavy/dense.  Turns out there is good reason for the choice of bun, my medium burger had plenty of juices dripping from it to soak several of my fires in and did not break down.  And speaking of the meat, the flavor was the star of the the hamburger rather than just part of the deal.  The only complaint was: I was offered my choice of fries and something else filling but I would have liked the option of some greens or cole slaw.  The service is fast casual where you order at the counter and you are on your own for utensils and filling your drink and they bring you meal out to your table.  The building sets up high enough to have a view of the strip and would be a wonderful place to sit on the patio on a spring or fall evening and watch the strip come to life.

It's worth 4 stars for the bacon alone.    I had been meaning to stop by for some time and finally cleared all the meat out of my tiny freezer.  When I got there at 8 on Saturday with my cooler I was the only customer.  The butcher and assistant were very helpful and my bacon, chops, steak and roast were all cut to order.  I also got some hamburger.  Everything was sealed.  Even knowing grass fed beef cooks quicker I still over did my steak. :(  Unless you have incredible self control this place is like Costco when it comes to impulse buying and $100 and more is spent before you know it.  Because they currently only get one steer a week many of the popular beef cuts have a waiting list.  It was definitely worth the trip downtown and I will be back again.

If you want to get someplace on time and you want me to find it you need to allow for some getting lost time.  GPS was invented for guys like me and I don't happen to own one.  In addition to finding this place I had been asked to find another place as well for future reference.  So after 3 trips around Scottsdale Mall (which really needs one of those map thingies) I found the first place and off I went on foot for Bacon.  Using Google I had picked out exactly where the building should be and walked right past it and by the time I crossed the bridge I was getting worried.  So I went a ways down 5th and still didn't see it so I headed back the way I came knowing I had a couple of other options for breakfast.  The sign over the door is much easier to spot heading south.  Bacon shares an address with Devils Martini and in fact may be dual usage of the same space.  I know there were Devils Martini placards on the tables.  If they do share the same space it would explain why it looks more like a bar/lounge inside than a coffee shop.  In any event I walked past it the first time without looking close because the building and parking signs I saw first said Devils Martini.  I didn't think to ask the question so maybe somebody will fill this West Valley person in with the answer.  In any event the easiest way to find it is to look for Vidal Sasoon and Bacon is across the street.  I was greeted quickly walking in the door and I took a high top with a view out the window.  The person who seated me got my orange juice and soon Tori, my server, came to take my order.  I ordered the first thing I saw that included gravy and potatos.  I think it was called the Big Pig ($9.50, I could be wrong on the name) and when it came that is sure what I felt like (see picture).  3 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages, ham, potatoes with gravy, baked beans with more bacon, fruit cup and a large English muffin.  More like a breakfast for 2 and if I had had a phone number for somebody I saw shortly afterward I would have offered.  In total volume I managed to finish off about 3/4 of it.  Food.  I had no problems with the quality of any of it.  Overall it was very good.  The orange juice was about 1/2 ice cubes which was fine at the start but very watered down tasting by the end of the meal.  Subjective to my taste buds the German style sausages did not deliver, I thought they were too fatty/liquidy and lacked any real flavor.  Service.  Tori waited on me hand and foot without being intrusive.  I did not have my camera with me and she showed me how to make the one in my phone work.  Looking around all the customers seemed pleased to be there.  One of the nice things about eating in the first wave before the crowds arrive is nobody has had a chance to ruin the servers day so everybody is pleasant.

I tend to live my life around resolving problems, Either for myself or others.  I love to cook and being single that leads me to giving out samples of what I have made.  I have a collection of good reusable plastic and a collection made up of items provided by food purveyors.  Just by chance some of the stuff I give away has already been frozen in a more expensive container which often does not come back.  Growing up, when you give something in a reusable container, it comes back filled with something else.  Our throw away society has pretty much ended that and most of the containers never come back, even empty.  So I started out looking on line for containers which bought in bulk were cheap enough that I did not feel bad if they didn't come back.  My requirements were it had to withstand freezing and a microwave.  I remembered Bacon's review of some sort of restaurant supply which was open to the public and after looking at their website I still did not understand what they had so I stopped in today.  Walking in the door it was like stepping into a cooking wonderland!  They acknowledged me in seconds and let me roam until I had questions.  And when I did find what I was looking for and had questions, they had answers.  I walked out of there with a whole system of containers for about $40.  If it wasn't for my wallet I would be there every week for something.

Sometimes you visit a place just knowing you will regret your decision.  At least 10 years ago and probably closer to 15 I picked up ham sandwiches to go here.  I did not care for either the sandwiches or the value and just never went back.  This was at a time when Honey Baked Ham company was first trying to find something to sell the 8 months of the year folks were not buying what many, including me, view as over priced meats for holidays.  Fast forward to today and I decided to take advantage of a coupon I found on line for a complete lunch for $6 (normally $8-9).  First impression on entering the deli/store that was remodeled about 5 years ago was very good.  The place is inviting and spotless, with racks and coolers with stuff for sale and an eating area off to one side.  The eating areas has about a dozen 2 tops that can be chained to fit larger parties.  The sandwich I chose was delicious.  They have about 20 to chose from and they can be modified to some extent.  I opted for the additional cost garden salad which the corporate programmed cash registers would not allow for the special pricing but they made it work.  The salad ($2.27) is actually a field greens mix and the croutons and dressing were served on the side (bonus points).  If you are eating in the lunch is served on real plates with real silverware, I thought this was amazing for a place that sells so much stuff to go in plastic containers.  Service is order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Serve yourself drinks.  Two different people came by while I was eating to make sure I was not in need of anything.  After my meal I explored the racks of stuff for sale and found packages of bean soups to make, various mustard/mayo/dressing containers and other stuff including preserves that were made without HFCS.  I purchased some delicious peach preserves that at $4,69 were in the right price range for what they were.  During the off season you can get coupons for stuff on line and I intend to take advantage of them.  This is now an addition to my lunch rotation as even at normal prices I consider them a good value.

To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought "strip mall Mexican, need to check this out".    The place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.  The food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.  This is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos.

Finally made it to a Lo-Lo's!  Met up with some folks for the Yelp Breakfast Club's first meeting.  I had the Stupid Fries which were very good.  I will have to go another time to try the chicken and waffles which were receiving high marks from everyone else at the table.  Service was good.  We got there early enough on a Sunday so we didn't have to wait for seating.  They only seat complete parties and don't split checks so bring cash for a group.  They do provide a receipt identified by seating position.

According to the phone book there are currently 6 locations of this local chain.  This location started life as a Taco Bell and has been several Mexican fast food places since then.  The building has seen a lot of wear.   They have quite a wide menu including mini soft tacos for $.99.  I got my usual test platter of a shredded beef taco and a cheese enchilada ($6.50) and a medium Horchata ($2.00).  The taco was both greasy and tasty, the two seem to go hand in hand.  The cheese enchilada came on a corn tortilla and was light on the cheese.  I didn't care for their choice of enchilada sauce.  The beans and rice were ok, the rice had mixed vegetables in it.  The overall serving size was quite ample.  The Horchata was one of the better ones I have had.  Serving the eat in orders on real plates is a nice touch.  But it leads to a problem as their is no way to clear your own table after the first two customers have and the place was not bussed while I was there so by the time I left 1/2 the inside tables were full of dirty dishes.  The woman handling the front counter was mistake prone, she asked me what I wanted in my burrito as if I had ordered a #6 instead of a #4 and my order came to $9.19 and she gave me back $10.19 instead of $10.81 from my $20.  Not a big deal and I did not discover it until I reconciled my cash at the end of the day.  Some where along the line they added a covered patio in front and judging by the fact the inside was full at lunch with a couple of us customers on the patio it is a good thing they did.  Many of the customers were take out so it is a popular spot.  I did not see take out menus nor do they appear to have a website so you have to go there and look at the menu board.  Because they have all the normal stuff it would be real easy to send one person with a list who could convert the combination's to numbers. They have a salsa bar and chips available.  The food is overall equal in quality and value to several other places.  I would probably choose to get that same level at a place that was kept up a bit better.  Judging by the number of customers there I may be in the minority.

I need to bump this up a star.  Having been here a few times now it really is above average for what it is.  The food is always good, never get crunchy rice.  The service is always quick and friendly.  They go their beer and wine thing sorted out a long time ago.  The only thing I would change now is: I happen to prefer sitting in a chair than a booth and the last few times I have been in they have all 8 of the tables set up in pairs to seat 8.  If one of those pairs was split in to 2 4tops then I would seat at a table rather than a booth.

Based on where I live, this is my entrance to the recreation trails that run along the Arizona canal and creeks that have been modified to allow for recreation and water runoff.  I like being able to ride my bike away from traffic.  At times the paths have quite a few folks walking, jogging, riding and even the occasional horse or skater.  There is a 15mph speed limit for bikes in the park but it is largely ignored by the road riders.  The furthest I have gone on the ac/dc path is 24th street.  I actually rode on the paths for about 6 months before I discovered the underpasses on the opposite side of the canal I had been riding on.

Met Rand H for lunch here.  Had a good red curry with chicken. Medium heat was exactly what I was expecting.  Service was excellent.  Pricing was reasonable with the lunch menu we chose from.  I would certainly go back.

I thought the seat cushions were worn out and I was uncomfortable long before the show was over. If I wasn't uncomfortable it would have been a 3.  Other than that the place was clean, including the restrooms.  The popcorn tasted like it should (Thanks Gabi).  It certainly wasn't very crowded.  The phone book and all the search engines show the address as 15512 N. Pima.  But the company website and the advance purchase ticket show it as 15515 N. Northsight which is where it is physically at and, armed with that information, I had no trouble finding it at the NE corner of Northsight and Hayden.

Searching far and wide for a better than average lunch and I sure didn't find it here.  My family, mostly now residing towards the South East, assured me Popeyes would blow the socks off both KFC and Churches so I made the 8 mile drive to the nearest location.  The chicken was about the same as Churches, and dry.  The mac and cheese wasn't near as good as KFC.  They were out of fries, and several items I heard others request.  I could not find the label for root beer.  Almost half the tables were still dirty from the last user.  OK, we need some pluses here.  The lunch was like $6.  The biscuit was good.  There was no up charge for white meat.  Conclusion: If I was in the mood for inexpensive fried chicken and a Popeyes was the closest I would probably go there but I would not drive past one of their competitors to get to one.

This is the first time I have been here since it opened.  Glad to see they kept the patio space intact.  We split a couple of sandwiches (The Calvano with chips and the griddled cheese with field greens) and each had a beer (Main Ale, Hefeweizen).  All the food was good.  Service was decent.  I would definitely go back again, preferably when the weather made it possible to sit on the patio.  We happened to arrive early and I think we got some happy hour pricing on the the beers as the total for two was quite reasonable.

My brother and his wife were staying just up the road for a few days and invited me out for dinner, like I would ever turn down dinner. :)  So when I got to their hotel I brought up the monocle and saw a bunch of places in the Scottsdale waterfront and Southbridge.  The two that looked the most promising were Olive and Ivy and Culinary Dropout.  We found parking and decided to try CD.  Walking in we had a choice of an hour wait, the community tables or outside.  Even in 100° heat we chose outside and were rewarded by a cooled and shaded patio that was quiet enough to talk on.  We passed on the cheese platter and ordered entrees.  Two hits and an ok on the salmon plate.  I had the beef stroganof and even though I do better this was the best rendition I had ever purchased.  Service was good throughout the meal.  As we were catching up on 13 years of not seeing each other we were not pressed to leave even though there were people in line waiting on a Thursday evening.  Just as a note:  This was my first trip to a Sam Fox restaurant and even being a sort of chain it certainly would not stop me from trying another of his concepts.

Jim W was in town and that was all the reason needed to party, well at least have dinner.  Heather C and Ryan C also were able to show up.  This was my first visit here.  I arrived last and there were chips, guacamole (thanks Ryan) and several salsas already on the table.  About half way through the second basket of chips we placed our orders.  Most of the table got tacos and I got the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  I also ordered the Horchata which was very tasty with the addition of nuts and fruit but when done left a pile of stuff in the bottom.  The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.  Service was fine and she split the checks after she had already given us a single one.  We were dining fairly early but as the evening wore on it got pretty busy on a Thursday even with a major Haboob going on.  Definitely a place worth checking out!

As I thought, this place is really a 4.  I have been back a few times now and have discovered if I get there by 11:15 my food comes out pretty quick and I can take my time eating.  They still only have one waitress at lunch but I have never seen more than 1/3 of the tables occupied at one time going early so it works fine.

If you get excited by standing in line to get a number and then standing or sitting around again for your number to be called by a guy on the other side of a barred counter in places like the MVD you will absolutely fall in love with the place.  The rest of you will have to go for the food.  Which fortunately is quite good.  I had a red chile and bean burrito, enchilada style and it was very good.  Nice big chunks of tender beef, a little bit of heat, one of the best red chile meals I have had.  Only open from 11 to 6 Tuesday trough Friday with another sign that says to call for hours this place stays packed.  There are several tables to eat inside but most folks were take out and many took several bags of food with them which may be why things seem to move so slow.  Bring cash.

I am fine with drinking tap water but my machinery isn't.  This is where I currently go to get my water bottles filled.  Having been here once a week for the last six months or so I think I can say I am a regular customer.  Whether you get help loading your bottles in the car and filling the bottles depends on who is working and how many customers there are at the moment, they are generally pretty good about it.  In addition to water they also have Thrifty ice cream, shaved ice, coffee and some other snacks.  It is a nice clean store.

I've walked by here many times in my stays at The Orleans.  Not much of a sweets person and the place is ALWAYS packed.  When I was leaving on my last stay I noticed they had a coffee and pastry special and I hoped it would be better than what I would normally get on my way out of town at the gas station.  The coffee was only ok but the fresh pastries I got were very good!  Of course being fresh the icing was gooey and got all over me on my way down the road. :-)

After the UYE at Mr Tofu I mentioned I was interested in wandering around Chinatown Mall and Jade W suggested stopping by here, I didn't need to be asked twice about trying a good Boba place.  I had a fresh, as apposed to a powdered, Mango Boba. It was delicious.  This place is a tiny shop in an indoor shopping area.  In addition to having fresh Boba they have a variety of dried fruits for sale.

What a great place for happy hour! Still not cheap but very reasonable. For 3 of us the bill was $61 + tax/tip. That included a craft drink and a draft beer not on the happy hour menu. And we didn't go away hungry by any means. We had poutine, fried shrimp, crispy chicken livers (2), vegetables w/ hummus, crispy cheese curds, beef sliders, and 3 glasses of wine. Happy hour seating is limited and was pretty much packed while we were there. The facility is beautiful. The service was very good. I would like to go back for brunch, while not inexpensive it would be a good chance to experience a different part of the restaurant. As a majority of the seating seems to be outside, spring and fall would seem to be the best time to visit.

How to make an impression: When picking up your date for the evening (2nd date) and she asks where you are going, tell her you decided to check out a local hotel...... with her daughter and her family in the room.  I got some strange looks and her  SIL made a point of stating we most likely would not be back in time to watch a movie.  Lafitte's is most definitely a hotel restaurant.  In place are the omelet station and self serve stations for breakfast/brunch.  Although we thought we had arrived early for dinner (6PM) the place was slammed with two large dining parties and a large gathering in the lounge area and the banquet room full too.  The dining room/lounge area appeared to have only one waitress and she was frazzled but holding up pretty well.  She mentioned this was A) abnormal and B) the second night in a row like this.  When my dining partner was in the restroom another diner mentioned her and her husband had come for a quiet dinner as this place was always deserted.  When she did get to us to take our drink order she advised us to order everything before 2 large parties got their dinner order in or it would be a while.  Turned out it was a while anyway, our total dinner stay was right at 2 hours.  I had printed out a menu and on the way over we discussed what we might get and it turns out the actual menu is just enough different we changed our minds.  We ended up with an appetizer of 2 crab cakes and she got a shrimp Po'boy which came with fries and I got the chicken Florentine which came with a salad, garlic mashed potatoes and some sauteed vegetables.  We both decided the crab cakes had a nice ratio of crab to filler but we were not used to the seasonings.  Why a salad of mixed greens needs to have some bitter stuff in itI don't know but this was another one I have come across that did.  The blue cheese dressing was heavy on vinegar.  Neither of us had had a shrimp Po'boy before and we both decided we liked it.  We also both liked the chicken and I liked the mashed potatoes and vegetables although there was nothing spectacular about them.  The house Merlot I had made Franzia look like a $40 a bottle wine.  Of note, although I think it was because they were slammed.  My salad came out before the appetizer and the crab cakes, although we made it well known we were sharing, did not come with a plate to share with.  As we were getting up to leave the manager caught up with us and apologized for the less than stellar service.  That was nice of her but we really didn't  notice it that much because we were in a mood to sit and chat anyway. At no time did we feel rushed.   We both decided it would be a place worth returning to.  It's probably more a 3.5 but the evening was a pleasant one so I don't mind rounding up.

I first knew this property as the bank where you could park after hours to avoid the parking nightmare at Texaz grill.  Now they have their own parking problem and provide valet during busy hours.  Anticipating what turned out to be a non problem I parked in the underutilized lot on the Southwest corner of the intersection.  I LOVE the space.  Our group of ten was seated at a long table on the "patio".  This space can be open to the air or heated or cooled as necessary.  The main interior can be wide open or closed off from the patio.  The patio area also has a second bar that can serve when they are busy.  I had the Vigazz burger.  The burger was really good but I would hesitate to call it great.  The sweet potato fries I chose were perfectly cooked.  The Bloody Mary was OK and the iced tea was pretty weak.  I also had a chance to try the guacamole, I liked it but I thought it could be seasoned some more.   Most of us had portions that we either had to abandon or take home.   The service was great.  The bathroom seemed a little weird, They were clean enough, the sink was a modern sloped design but they had old style folding towel dispensers.  I would certainly go back here again.

One of these days I will learn to listen to my server.  Case in point, today I wanted to try the mac and cheese with a burger and my server suggested I try one of the versions other than plain.  Of course I didn't listen and while it was certainly OK there was not a bold cheesy taste.  After thinking about it I realized it wasn't designed to be bold by itself so that it could be a base for other things to be added, DUH!  Seeing as I have 9 check ins in 4 months it is obvious they are a regular in my lunch rotation.  It is a friendly place to go and most of the employees know me.  Quite often James, the GM, will wander around the customers and chat.  Once he even filled in as a server when one was sick, I think he needs to stick to his day job. :-)  If you see something on the chalkboard that looks interesting better get it then as it may disappear in a week or still be there in a month.  I have missed the opportunity to try a couple of items because I already "knew" what I wanted to have and should have been more flexible.  There is a patio in the back which is heated in the winter.  I have found it is easiest to park in the back and use the back door.

I came here today for a birthday get together for fellow Yelper Arana W.  Being a Saturday I was expecting the place to be slammed.  It was only about 1/3 full and it only took a few minutes to set up a table for 10.  In good weather there is additional seating on the patio.  This is a new building and I noticed the layout could be easily remodeled to a full service restaurant with a full bar and a private group dining room in place of the buffet serving area.  There were plenty of food choices and all I tried were good.  I have finally come to the conclusion that 2 plates of food plus dessert are all I can handle any more so I had my two plates of food and in that I had at least 20 different items in small portions.  I skipped the dessert trip (well I did try some of Arana's gelatos) because my next stop for the day was Sweet Republic.  Everybody had positive comments on the foods they had, including the desserts.  The service, both at the table and the serving area, was excellent.  We were there 2-1/2 hours and at no time did we feel rushed.  In fact they were still coming around refilling waters and drinks.  At $12.95 this is an excellent value and I am not sure why it wasn't packed as the casino itself was quite busy.  Lunch is only 11-3 and then they shut down and get ready for dinner, which I think starts at 5.    I very seldom think of a casino buffet as destination dining but this place sure comes close.

I've been meaning to try this place forever.  It is just a little to far from my shop to go for lunch.  Recently I was driving down I17 and wanted a burger for lunch and remembered about this place and got off sooner than I normally would.  I got a cheeseburger combo with onion rings which came with a nice dipping sauce.  Pretty good burger.  Even with all those bottled sodas I just had the fountain drink that came with the combo.  It's fast casual, order at the counter and they bring it to you.

It's over a week now since Yelp office hours met up with Short Leash Dogs at their Pop-Up location on W McDowell.  I can still taste the hot dog I had.  Beef hot dog w/ grilled onions, cheddar cheese and spicy mustard.  I have to say it was better than your average dog.  If you get a chance to catch up with these folks I suggest you do.  They not only make good dogs they are nice people to deal with.  They were even out of the trailer checking on customers as we were eating.

Went here for Dim Sum with the Breakfast  Club. Turns out we had just the right amount of folks for the largest of the tables.  I am still not that up on what is in everything but with two in our group that spoke Chinese we had no surprises.  There were some textures I didn't care for but nothing I disliked the taste of and I went away full without much of a dent in the wallet.    I really need to go back and explore the plaza more.  It looks sort of like they just wall off part of the food court to serve Dim Sum.

Went here for a Saturday Smunch.  They were packed but the service was still great.  As things slowed down about noon the owner came out and made the rounds of his guests.  I had the chicken fried steak, scrambled eggs, potatoes, skipped the toast and added a short stack of pancakes.  Way too much food for me but it was all good, very seldom do I get pancakes that are not doughy and overly filling (including my own kitchen), I really liked these.

An old friend from high school and I were meeting for breakfast.  This time of year is perfect for eating outdoors and this was in the area.  I had never heard of it but I posted what I was looking for in talk and this place came recommended.  Turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.  Open by 7AM on a Saturday, full wait service and a patio that wasn't pushed right up against the sidewalk.  Service and food were both excellent.  Even though it was atteched to a resort it wasn't unreasonably priced.

Went here with a group of folks for brunch.  We took advantage of spring in February and took over a couple of picnic tables in the front yard. Really nice relaxing atmosphere. Service was friendly, even after I spilled some of my coffee on myself and the floor. :)  I had a jelly turkey melt that had Jalapeno bacon jam in it. It was great. I did not hear a single complaint about anything that anybody else had either. I know modern day coffee shops are all about the different coffee based drinks but their base drip coffee is pretty good black.

Definitely one of the better buffets in the valley and possibly THE best on the West side.  I've been here twice now for lunch with Rand, Norm and Mike.  The food and service have always been good.  Because they have so many items, several go off the beaten path in entrees and desserts which means everybody should find something they like.

About time I ate here. Long before it opened the owner started a Facebook page and some of my friends liked it so I did too. So I got follow along as he put the place together and after he opened enhanced the outdoor seating. Nothing seemed to present a reason to go here. Last night that got fixed.  We arrived well before our reservation but without hesitation they were able to seat us. They were pretty much packed the whole time we were there. Service and food were slow like they were short servers which surprised me as a friend of mine's daughter worked there for a while and they would always staff for a full house so no server had too many tables but the complaint was: on a slow night they did not make much in tips. So the slow service and the noise level are what brought it down to below 4.5, but not by much.  Our server was actually very pleasant and knowledgeable. From all the hype I expected no flaws in the food or the presentation and that is what we got. For an appetizer we got the mac and cheese and we both decided it was filling enough we could have gone home at that point. But onward we went. I had the short ribs and my dining companion got the petite chicken and of course we shared back and forth. She took 1/2 her chicken home and I left about 4 bites of mashed potato on the plate. At this point we were stuffed to uncomfortable but several of the deserts looked good. Unfortunately they were sold out of peach cobbler and I like just about everything peach. We shared the chocolate bacon s'mores  and they were great.  Definitely a place I would return to and reccomend.

I was having brunch with friends this morning and mentioned I was going thrift store hunting for a couple of items afterwards and a couple of folks suggested I stop in here as it was on my intended path.  The folks were real friendly.  With the help of another Yelper that happened to be there I found pretty much one of the items I was looking for, my eyes/brain connection don't work as well as they used to. :-)  Everything in the store is spotless and seems to be in much better condition than you would find in a thrift store.  Prices seem to run in the 60-70% range of new based on the one item I had a perfect match to, and mine still has all of the accessories.  They have rather short operating hours but I will stop in whenever I am in the area at the right time as one of my big weaknesses is kitchen gadgets.

I went here a couple of weeks ago for a Smunch get together.  We had a group of about 10 spread across two tables.  This was sort of a basic breakfast/lunch place but a bit on the larger side and with lots of diners it had a good feel to it.  Service was great and they did not bat an eyelash at the few special requests made.  My first menu choice was eliminated because they did not have gravy that morning so I went with the potato pancakes.  Not impressed, they were very sweet owing to the onions chosen and were thin and burnt a bit around the edges.  The side of corned beef hash however was excellent, shaved corned beef mixed with their rosemary potatoes.  Being a half hour drive in the wrong direction I wouldn't go back on my own but I would certainly recommend it for a meeting place with somebody in the area.

I was here for The Breakfast Club.  Were were seated along the South window above the courtyard.  The dining room itself was really nice. Those in our group from the East Valley were delayed up to a half hour for road construction and they didn't bat an eyelash.  Service was spot on the whole time.  I had a prix fixe special of a chicken entree on fried gnocchi with Parmesan fries and a Tanzy salad.  It was all excellent.  Even in Scottsdale, if the salad had been $14 instead of included I thought it would be over priced.

Like Audrey I would have liked to give this place a 3.5.  I rounded up for a few reasons, including for the company at the time.  I like the layout of the place.  I loved the food.  I think it was a bit pricey, but that may be because I am used to getting stuffed, which I wasn't, for far less money.  While some may say the service was slow I would call it relaxed, nothing came quickly but there was no rush to get us out of there.  I think it is deliberate on their end to create a relaxed atmosphere, however turning tables slowly added to the high rent district they are in has a cost that has to be applied to the food.  Speaking of the food; I had the salmon hash but also tried several other dishes.  My plate was delicious but I would certainly consider the Red Velvet pancakes as they were the true definition of desert for breakfast.  And they serve a decaf which tastes like real coffee!  The true test of any review has to be whether I would return and/or recommend it to my friends.  Yes on both accounts but not often as, for me, it is priced as a special occasion place.

What a lovely place to stroll.  For the most part I can't afford to do more than window shop.  I have spent some time more than once on the "patio" of Fat Tuesdays drinking a margarita and watching the Atlantis show and I bought a birthday present cap at the now gone Ferrari store.

Was here last week for the Yelp Breakfast Club UYE.  Even though we were potentially a large group we were seated quickly and had good service throughout the meal.  My breakfast meatloaf hash ( a chunk of meatloaf on a bed of onions, mushrooms, cheese, potatoes and eggs with the whole thing smothered in brown gravy)  was not only good but the serving was huge.  Everybody else in the group had good things to say about their choices.  Splitting checks was not a problem for them.

I met some friends here for brunch which is a recent undertaking for these folks.  I liked the atmosphere.  The service was great.  Maybe a bit pricey but not out of line.  I ordered the crab cake Benedict and it was absolutely delicious!  I wish I had not been going to run machinery afterward as I would have liked to try their Bloody Mary bar.  I did get to try their sausage gravy, ordered by 5 of our party, and did not care for it but those that ordered it loved it.  I also got to sample the pancakes with strawberries and mascarpone and it was tasty but I thought the pancake was a little on the spongy side.  I had heard about the parking problems and parked at the shopping center just a couple of blocks away and walked over.  As it gets better known this will definitely be a hot spot for weekend brunches.

This is in Sun City.  They cook for people old enough to be my parents (I am old enough to live there). I really didn't expect much but it was convenient to where I was that morning. Service was laid back but attentive enough and pleasant. The hash browns were pretty much as I expected, some parts not cooked and other parts so crunchy they hurt my teeth. But I must say the traditional eggs Benedict was one of the best I have ever had. Perfect runny yolks with no clear under cooked white parts, a tasty hollandaise that had zero separation. They used ham rather than Canadian bacon but that did not detract at all. To do that well on a difficult dish I bet they are pretty good on some other dishes too. Based on my first visit they have moved up on my list for places for a Wednesday morning breakfast.

I was just finishing up my last customer stop for the day and mentioned I was going to lunch in the Metro Center area and he asked if I would mind some company.  We settled on here and he is somewhat a regular.  Getting there around 11:30 the lot was full and inside was pretty busy.  I always like to see a lot of people in a buffet so the food turns faster.  Speaking of the food, I had nothing I felt like not finishing.  The grill line was really long so I didn't try that but my customer says that is the best part.  I had several items from the sushi counter.  The ice cream was the proper consistency.  I may have just had the wrong things but nothing really stood out as having much flavor.  It gets the 4th star for being a good value at $6.99 for lunch.

I had occasion to go back this weekend to show a friend where it was hidden and there was a parking spot open so I we couldn't resist.  We had our bowls of ice cream on the patio on a great sunny afternoon.  The person who waited on us saw to it I got a punch card which for some reason I missed the first time around.  I have to give them another 1/2 star as the patio setting was perfect for a bowl of ice cream.

I've been going here for 4 months now. This is the first gym I've ever been in.  Everything is always clean and the employees pleasant.  Most of the time I go in about 4AM so my perception may be tainted by how quiet it is but there is a regular morning crowd and we all nod as we go in and out. I joined mostly to do cardio in a temperature regulated environment and that is working out much better than walking around the block for me.  Sometimes I will use the circuit of machines.  One time they failed to open and one time there was almost a whole row of broken machines but neither has turned into a regular problem.

I had the good fortune to attend opening day with Rand H, Norm R, Mike  C, Robyn N and Jeromy H.  AKA the buffet testers :-)    All of the Asian dishes I tasted were good as were the deserts.  I felt they fell short on the mac and cheese and the clam chowder.  Although I didn't have much I felt the selection of salad fixings were above normal.  I was quite impressed with the selection of sushi.  Our party has different ideas of what foods they judge a buffet by and there were very few items that fell short of properly prepared.  They had some opening day hiccups like being able to get the cash registers to work, getting all the menu items labeled and I think they should have a pile of napkins with the flatware so you can grab some.  I think it was one of the owners that saw me taking pictures and pointed out some shots I should take.  Our table was also visited by the owner of the building who is taking a highly visible interest in how things are being accepted by the customers.  If you are in to Chinese buffets this is one you should put on your list to try.

So midday on a Saturday after a UYE at Oink I meet my helper at the shop so she can do some data entry.  Push the button on the computer and nothing happens!  Using my phone I found Michael on Yelp (where else would I look?).  For some reason none of the reviews would show but a tip from a seasoned Yelper sounded good. If I had seen the reviews from 3 Yelpers with hardly any reviews I may have kept looking.  Well luck seemed to be on my side.  I called and he was open as advertised.  When I got there he plugged in a few cables, did some checking and then wired in a power supply he had there on the front counter.  Problem solved I needed a power supply.  When I said I would toss it in myself he made a point of saying I could buy a similar one at Frys for half the price.  Being a small business owner myself I bought it from him because of the quick and free diagnosis.  He even let me swap out the power supply right there on the counter as he was helping another customer.  Luck seemed to be with in spades as it turned out I needed to lengthen a wire and he happened to have just the right jumper laying around that he didn't even charge me for.    In less than 30 minutes I was out of there with a working computer.  Definitely a case where I saved money in the long run by going to somebody who knew what he was doing.  I'll go back again if I need to and plan on upgrading my 10 year old computer from him early next year.

I just flat love Sur La Table.  I noticed their absence from The Miracle Mile shops last summer and asked around my friends and found out this was where they had moved.  So I had to go check them out!  They have gone from an average sized store to the largest in the chain to now the smallest in the chain.  Inventory must be a real night mare here with no real stock room and hardly any walking room between the racks.  I hear they are still looking for a space to have a teaching kitchen, possibly out in the Summerlin area.  I resisted buying anything as I was on foot that day.

I started hearing about this place a few years ago.  However it is a bit of a drive from Glendale.  Last week I was querying some friends for an herb I needed to fill an old recipe.  One of them suggested Penzey's and after looking on line to see they carried it and knowing I was going to be in the East Valley today I made it a point to stop in.  I'm hooked!  I saw so many things that I had looked for elsewhere in the past and could never find.  This will now be the first place I head for for those items you just cannot find anywhere.

I am from Santa Barbara and had eaten several times at the original one.  Having been disappointed by some of the other hamburger chains that have come in here in the last few years with much fanfare from people that came from the same towns I was worried that a hamburger from my own home town might be a let down from either a taste or value stand point.  I need not have worried.  I took a friend with me and we each had a mushroom swiss  burger and I had onion rings and she had sweet potato fries.  We both liked the food.  2 burgers, 2 drinks, fries and onion rings were under $19 incl tax.  And being a lovely day we found a spot on the patio and camped out for over an hour.  The staff was friendly and close to being too attentive.  Parking sucks.  Even after the original opening hype they are still packed for a Sunday lunch so they must be doing something right.  I know I will return.

Was here for Smunch.  Let me get the one bad thing out of the way: the parking lot stinks.  While there are lots of fake meat options, which several in our party had, I went with stir fried vegetables and fried tofu on rice. It was really good.  Nobody in our group disliked their meal.  The people are really friendly and the service was good.  It is fast casual so you order at the counter.  Because it is not standard fare for most folks they can all answer questions about what ingredients are in each dish.

Rand H, Norm R, Mike C and I ended up here after trying to go to Fu-Fu and they chose not to open at 11.  The place was clean.  It was busy enough nothing that I tried seem to be getting stale in the tray.  The staff was busily cleaning the serving area and clearing plates in the dining room.  I liked having the food pretty much centrally located.  Norm even managed to find a set of chop sticks.

I was downtown for brunch this morning and the idea of a farmers market that was somewhat accessible to where I live sounded pretty good.  Unfortunately I arrived in the last half hour so the picking in fresh vegetables were sparse.  Armed with my Yelp tote I did pick up a banana squash and some tomatoes.  I liked being on the lawn and having plenty of parking.  In this, only their second week, they seemed pretty well organized.  Having just eaten I did not venture to the food trucks but I will plan my next visit hungry.  They are open 9-2 on Saturdays.  They operate on the grounds of a church on the SE corner of Central and Northern.

I had seen the signs up as I went by for a while not knowing it was an already established owner.  Then I saw Daren's review and decided to try the place.  It is sort of tucked in behind the pizza place which occupies most of the building.  The business name does not fully describe the wide variety of stuff available on the menu.  I arrived a few minutes early and the doors were wide open and everything was ready for business.  The counter person/server was very friendly.  I got the chicken Caesar pita sandwich with a salad and soda fountain.  Service is fast casual where you order at the counter and they bring it to you.  The restaurant is bright and airy and clean.  It was a lovely fall day outside so I chose to sit on the shaded patio.  I am going to nitpik a little because I cannot find much to fault; the Caesar dressing was a bit too vinegary for my taste and I would prefer more Feta on my salad.    I'll definitely be back to try some more stuff on the menu.

I've been to one other location of this local chain and liked it so when a friend and I went to the aquarium we planned on eating here. Friday night and the place was packed but we got seated right away. We even got a table right next to the shark tank! After our drinks came things slowed up a bit and it was a while before our orders were taken and almost forever before we got our food. I got a full rack of St Louis style ribs knowing I would have enough for leftovers and they were decent, a touch on the overdone side.  I got corn and macaroni and cheese as my sides and they were both good.

I decided I needed better walking shoes.  A few months ago I was talking with the branch manager of my bank who runs marathons and he said he bought his shoes here and after several pairs he was still happy with the shoes and the service.  When I walked in the place with packed with folks picking up packets for the race the next day.  Still I was greeted quickly and after some preliminary talk about what I was looking for Marcus took me back and brought out several pairs of shoes to try and based on my comments brought out a bunch more, some I tried twice.  After I had picked what I wanted they did not have my size in stock in the color scheme I wanted so he checked one of the other two stores inventory and had them sent over.  I expected that would take a few days so they were not making a special trip and I was good with that.  By the time I got home from grocery shopping I got a call they had already arrived from Tempe, seems the owner had a couple of other things to transfer and brought them over himself.  I went to pick them up the next day and Marcus was off.  I have been to stores where only the person you dealt with originally really knew what was going on.  Not here, within a minute of walking in the store I had my new shoes in my hand.  I just got back from my third 4 mile walk with these shoes and am still very happy with them.

So I wasn't sure where I wanted to eat lunch today and headed off this direction thinking I wanted a sit down hamburger.  I spotted the Coco's sign and I haven't been in one for years so I stopped here.  Not my normal part of town and I was unable to check in and found out later it used to be a JBs and even kept the old phone number so I guess Coco's bought out the JBs. chain seeing as the JB's website has been abandoned.  Was greeted and set at a table as soon as I walked in about 11:45.  Hostess brought my iced tea and a menu quickly.  Waitress was there soon and took my order.  I chose the San Fransisco sourdough burger (medium) and upgraded to a salad instead of the standard options.  Both the burger and the salad were really good and I was quite full.  While not an inexpensive lunch, about $11 before tax and tip, everything was fresh and prepared well.  The service was spot on.    One of the reasons I chose to head to the Desert Sky mall area was restaurants don't tend to have wait problems for lunch like many places near Metro Center (about the same driving distance from where I work.) and there were only a few other tables filled.  That is a plus when you need to get back to work.

One of the better Asian buffets I have been to.  Heightened by being in the company of Rand H, Robyn N, Norm R and Mike C.  This was stop one in my eating summer vacation from work.  Not one to eat sushi they had some deep fried items I actually liked.  Instead of the pretty common steam and refrigerated tables the platters are much smaller so the food is kept fresher.  A couple of items ran short but only for a minute or two.  They have several folks running around that know what needs to be done.  Really 4.5 stars but folks that know me know I seldom round up.

Talk about easy.  I had a couple of items in my car that I was going to drop off at a location nearer to me later in the day.  I had left my car in their parking lot while I attended the BCUYE and they were open when we were done. Pulled my car in, a young man walked out pushing a cart, I opened the tailgate and we put the items in his cart and I was done. He offered a receipt which I did not need.Total time: less than 2 minutes.

Met a friend here for lunch Saturday. For starters we shared a small roasted bell pepper hummus. She had a Falafel Pita and I had chicken tikka masala and we sampled each other's. We decided all the food we had was good. We had really good service, especially as we had a 2 hour lunch. We never felt hurried even as it got busy later on. The decor was nice, a mixture of different size tables that they were moving around to accommodate different size groups and some high tops and a community table. They have a nice patio but it was a bit chilly to eat out there in the shade. Just as we were leaving we noticed the lamp shades and bicycles hanging from the ceiling.

For my money the best of the 3 or 4 Asian buffets in this stretch of Indian School.  Recently remodeled.  Plenty of choices.  Most of the trays were the proper temperature.  I've been twice now and it was busy during the opening weeks but not so much the second trip which led to a few trays aging before getting empty.  I hope it develops the following in the neighborhood it deserves.

Enjoyed lunch here with Rand, Norm, Mike and Jose.  My grilled fish came out perfect.  I really enjoyed my black beans and rice but was surprised it had some bits of pork in it, vegetarians beware.  There is a white rice option.  Service was great and friendly.  We had 5 different dishes and everybody liked them so it would seem you could throw a dart at the menu and like whatever it landed on.

I've had this place bookmarked for a while on several friends recommendations  but it never seemed to fit my schedule. Then for Christmas I got a gift certificate so I really had to get here. Went for lunch on a weekday. Had a special sandwich that was sort of like a corned beef and cabbage meal on a roll. It was ok. The lemonade was a good take on that. I managed to steer clear of the bakery case. I would give this a 3-1/2 but the folks are so friendly I had to round up instead of down.

This was our destination for the May Smunch.  There was some mix up with our reservation but we were still able to get one of the only two tables that were expandable for a party of more than 4.  From that point on the service and food were great.  I had a crab cakes Benedict that was really good and came with fresh fruit and perfect hash browns that were made even better with a mixture of ketchup and Sriracha.

I was here with a group that took over the entire patio on a beautiful spring day for brunch.  They even had to bring out more chairs as our group grew to about 10. Most of us had breakfast, I had lunch and some had combinations of both. They supposedly don't do gluten free but the one in our party whom it mattered to they worked with to change some ingredients around.  This is not gourmet food.  But it is well cooked basic stuff, and easy on the pocket book. With a large group somebody is bound to have a food complaint, every plate was cleaned. All the staff we dealt with were pleasant.  So maybe the neighborhood is not where you would expect to find good food at a good price but I would not hesitate to go here again.

I finally went. It was a great time. Crowded, eclectic, food, art, people watching, free hugs. Given a chance, I would go again.

Went here totally by chance because another nearby place had a one hour wait. When we stepped in here we were told we would have over a 2 hour wait but.... if we could find space at the bar we could order dinner from there too. We looked at the bar just as two spots opened up and jumped at them.  From that point on everything was perfect. I had medallions of beef on a bed of truffle mac and cheese and my friend had a sort of savory bread pudding thing made with squash. I seldom get dessert but the Brie cheesecake sounded intriguing so we split it and it was fantastic.  Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgeable about the menu and helped us decide on our food/drink orders. Even though the place was full up there was none of the out of control pandemonium that sometimes occurs in places that are busy.  From a budget standpoint I would say plan on $50 person with an entree, a drink, a shared dessert and tip.

Review number 400.  A milestone review because of it's number but also a special review as it was not only one of the best Jewish deli sandwiches I have had but the last meal I may have in quite a while with one of my friends who is moving away and have shared many meals with.  Coming in at mid afternoon on a Sunday we were seated right away and our service remained top notch the entire time we we here.  Unlike most delis in the valley this is a full service restaurant and is priced a little higher.  We shared a chopped liver plate which came with bread, onions and some other stuff.  It was good.  She had brisket and I had pastrami and corned beef on challa bread, which she had suggested to me after our last Jewish deli outing. I had planned on Sweet Republic afterward and no way was that going to happen.  All of our food items were great!

I was here a couple of weeks back for Smunch.  It was during a bitter cold weekend so as cool as the patio looked there was only one bundled up couple.  The place was busy the whole time we were there and several people waiting for seating as we left.  But we, a party of 12, never felt rushed.  Service was very good.  The two waitresses knew the menu and had no problems splitting checks and answering questions.  I had the crabby omelet with DD hash and it was very good and I had trouble stuffing it all in.

I met up with some friends here for lunch on a Saturday.  This was my first trip to any of the Upward Projects facilities since the new parking lot across the street.  Made the overall visit much nicer.  I was able to park at Federal, brunch at 10 at Windsor, lunch at 11 at Federal Pizza and dessert at Churn at 12:30 with different groups without having to move my car or deal with valet.  I got to lunch at the tail end of the group as us stragglers came in the staff just kept rearranging tables. Service was great the whole time and the staff was fully prepared to answer questions and provide suggestions.  I had already decided on The Magnificent with a glass of 8th Street ale.  Both were very good.  So now I've been to everyplace but Postino and liked all of them.  I need to try the remaining one that was really the first of theirs in the neighborhood.

This is a really nice park.  I was here last week for a friend's 5k walk.  Everything is clean and well maintained.  In addition to the parking lot at the North end, entered from Camelback, there is street parking on the South and Southwest.  There are a few bbq areas and a children's play area.  Also a good sized field for games.

This is the largest entry spot into the North mountain park.  It is clean.  There are Rangers to help with trail and wildlife information.  The hike itself up Shaw Butte is on a maintenance road for the towers at the top.  It is pretty strenuous but being a road of sorts there is no congestion as hikers of different abilities pass and get passed.  The views of the West Valley are great and well worth the hike.

I had not been to the new location a block away from the old one.  I met Rand H here for lunch the other day.  He out ate me about 2-1 so I am not sure the never ending pasta bowl was that great of a deal for me.   With my one bowl of pasta I had a breadstick and the whole serving bowl of salad.  One thing about chains is they  are predictable and this was no exception.  The food was good but not exciting.  The one thing that can change from one location to another is the service and ours was excellent on this trip.  Even with the larger building this place was almost at capacity as we were leaving just after 12.

So I got past my fear of needles and decided to see what this giving blood thing was all about.  I've been 3 times now and will keep going back.  It really doesn't hurt but for a few seconds.  Most of the time they get you in and out pretty quick.  Everybody is really friendly and knowledgeable.  They understand that your experience there has a lot to do with repeat visits.  I did not know my blood type when I started.  Turns out I am O- which is a universal donor.  This is review 500 for me and I couldn't think of another business more worthy of it.  They do a wonderful job of helping people help others.

I have kept hearing about this place but was wary because some of the other burger transplants in the last few years have been mediocre in my opinion.  I had the little cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, mayonnaise and grilled onions and a little fries.  Really good, with one exception of there being to much salt on the fries.  If you want to sit outside make sure at least one of your party stays inside to hear your number called.

This was an unplanned Smunch venue as we gathered where we expected to find food trucks that were not there.  It was on several folks lists to try so off we went.  Walking in with a group of twelve we were able to secure 1/2 the patio.  Most of us had been to Gallo Blanco several times so we had some idea what to expect.  Otro is quieter.  General consensus was the food was just as good if not a bit better.  I think they have a bit more freedom with spices not being a hotel restaurant. I had the trio of enchiladas with rice and beans which were all excellent with the only exception of I didn't care for their interpretation of mole.  I had to take my rice and beans with me for lunch the next day.  Because we were starving by this point I had already eaten the enchilada with the verde sauce by the time I remembered to take a picture so I didn't post it because it looks funny.   Not everybody has found Otro yet so there was no trouble getting seated at midday on a Saturday.  Service was good the entire meal.

If you had mentioned to me a few years ago that a group of friends were having brunch at a Vegan restaurant I would have found a reason to be busy that day.  One thing the friends I have made directly and indirectly through Yelp is I have yet to meet all the foods I like.  I chose a chickpea burger and it was good as was the cole slaw I had with it.  In our party of 10 we tried almost everything on the menu and every plate was clean at the end.  I think the only thing that fell short was the eggplant "bacon".  This restaurant only seats a few over 20 and our party of 10 was a bit rough for them to get the food out all at once but we were not in a hurry and they were very friendly.  They are also a bakery with pies and donuts and such. I would go back again.

BMO Harris bought out M&I.  The services got pricier and not as good.  Their online business banking is at least a decade behind in terms of real time data, even the branch employees cannot see things in real time.  If it wasn't for the fact all the folks held over from M&I know me and I can ask questions and get help at the branch level I would have found another bank.

Went here with a group after hiking Shaw Butte.  With all the different beers and foods we tried and shared most all were hits.  The portions were ample.  Service was mostly good.  Our group was large enough to put a strain on the kitchen so it took a while for our food.  The room had a good feel to it.  There is a nice patio but we all decided it was too hot to sit out there in the sun.  There are umbrellas but there is always somebody left out in the sun.

OK.  This place has to make it in this somewhat jinxed location.  First a never ending stream of Mexican restaurants and the last tenant was a Hawaiian BBQ with decent but not striking food.  These folks have completely redone the space.  The sandwich and onion rings I had were excellent.  The folks running the place are friendly and efficient.  When you are placing the order they ask all sorts of questions to make sure it comes out the way you want it, not just the way they want to make it.  While the place was not crowded it was obvious several of the folks eating there or picking up to go orders were already regular customers.  There are lots of items on the menu and I will be back to try some more of them.

OK, my first one star review.  Not that I have never been anyplace worthy of the single star but I usually figure those places have enough problems without my one star review.  I have stopped here to grab a quick sandwich coming or going to Nevada several times.  I recognized the woman at the counter  as having waited on me before.  I was about 3 people back in line when I heard a gentleman ask her if the food item she was giving him was the same one just returned by another customer.  She acknowledged it was and he asked for a fresh one, which she promptly gave him.  I don't know the whole story, how long it was away from the counter if at all.  Heck for all I know it was a drive through customer that didn't have enough funds when they got to the window and they unbagged some or all of an order.  The exchange that I heard made me uncomfortable and I got out of line and got a bag of Cheetos in the store to munch on.

I was at the mall for some other things and being a holiday weekend they had sales going on everywhere so I went in to see if they had anything I just couldn't do without.  This store seems a little smaller than the one I have shopped several times in Las Vegas but the layout is sort of similar with the shoes in the back.  I dealt with two employees on the floor and both were friendly and knowledgeable.  I had found a pair of walking shorts on the wall that were just like a pair I had and wanted a backup for.  The sales associate found one for me, without me asking, on a sales rack that were almost identical.  So much for me just browsing.

I met up with the Vegas Yelp folks here for a UYE while I was in town.  This was only their second week venturing to the Westside. According to them, based on the growing customer base, they will continue to come on Wednesday evenings.  Shaved ice is traditionally flavored with fruit syrups but these folks have all sorts of different flavors and toppings and will even do two flavors in a serving.  Except when the weather turns cool I expect these folks to do well.  As a note I decided to keep to a couple of simple flavors and had coffee topped with diced strawberries.  It was very good and I heard nothing but good things about all the combinations the other folks tried.

I had been warned it gets busy so I went early, like 7AM on a Saturday.  By the time I left about 7:45 there were only a few inside tables left.  There is nobody snoozing in the place.  All the employees were cheerful and seeing to it the customers were taken care of.  I had their take on corned beef hash and eggs and it was good.  If it wasn't so far out of my normal path I would be a frequent visitor.

We were there for our monthly Smunch.  Only about half the folks who said they were coming showed up.  Their bad.  Somehow the restaurant had started following Smunch on Twitter so they knew we were coming.  They didn't know all the adults there were also Yelpers.  I think the front of the house was over staffed for anything less than a full house, which it never came close to.  Never having been to another America's location I had nothing to compare it too.  Two of our party are regulars at the 7th St and 7th Ave locations.  All of us liked the food and the service.  Fast casual is not a place I would normally tip but the service throughout was good enough all of us tipped on the way out.  I had the taco trio and a Cochata.  Very good stuff.  If you go in and start moving tables around for a group they will actually bring out larger chip bowls and a large serving of each of the 3 dips for the table to share rather than the small serving with one salsa that normally comes with an entree.  I am pretty sure we decided in order that the guacamole, then the spicier salsa then the mild salsa.  In fact the mild hardly got touched.  So maybe it is only a 3-1/2 but it was so much better than the previous reviews had led us to believe that I rounded up instead of down this time.

Many of my friends have recommended this place so I met up with a friend who lives in the area for lunch.  I, of course, was late.  We were given the quick tour of how the place works and were able to get one of the last remaining tables.  I ordered the Ahi tuna burger and the truffle fries.  I thought the tuna was done perfect but many folks would have say it was a bit too well done and my friend said it looked so rare she would not have touched it. She had a cheese burger, very well done, and fries and she liked it.  A word on the truffle fries, they were very good but the order is large enough they need to be shared.  I took over half the order home with me.  Every body on the staff we dealt with was friendly and knowledgeable.  They really fill up for a weekday lunch but it did not hurt the service quality or timing.

I seldom eat doughnuts as they are sweet and I don't do many sweets with any regularity. After my experience here I'll never be able to look a normal doughnut in the eyes again.  I found myself waiting for a customer to meet me in the parking lot and had heard several people say the doughnuts here were good, especially the bacon one.  I was totally unprepared for a custom fresh cooked doughnut.  I chose the Bacon Blast from the menu.  Then I got to watch them make my doughnut from scratch as it went in the fryer.  Then they dipped it in maple icing followed by a generous portion of thick cut bacon crumbles.  This was not a take back to the office doughnut, it was made to be eaten while still warm and soft and gooey.  And I did. :)  As an added bonus, at $1.25 it was reasonably priced.

My bedtime is about 8:30 so why was I shopping at 9:30 a half hour drive from home?  Because I rarely get to that part of town and I wanted ice cream.  Specifically Sweet Republic and McConnell's.  I did pick up an artichoke to balance things out.  Also I had just dined a few steps away at Grassroots.  I have now been to all three Whole Foods that are each about 1/2 hour drive from home.  No wonder I am impressed with this brand new store.  Looking around I see lots of cabinetry built by one of my customers.  Really nice to see the stuff built by my customers in its final environment.  Still not as big as my first Whole Foods at Town Center in Vegas but certainly a huge improvement over Tatum and Shea.  I wasn't looking for macarons that night but I spotted them and may find my way back just for some. ;)

Real Men Don't Eat Quiche.(1)  So fine, I'll just turn in my man card for a month.  Only served on Saturdays and the ingredients change according to availability.  This generous portion of quiche in bacon spinach form was enjoyed by 3 of the 6 people at our table.  It came with a bowl of diced melons.  Not to say it is the only good thing to eat here as everything ordered at the table disappeared quickly from our plates.  Including a shared stack of pancakes of which I had one.  But the quiche alone is enough reason to get there on a Saturday.  This was my first time at the new digs.  The small parking lot is saved by having street parking along the canal.  There are more tables here but on this Saturday late morning there was never more than a couple of empty tables at any given time.  With the layout large groups have to be broken up.  Service was spot on.  And the owner was visible in the dining room most of the time helping out where needed.  (1)Feirstein 1982)

Went here with a friend who had never been to a Habit.  The cashier was quite knowledgeable on the menu and what the differences were between the original store and this one.  We ordered a couple of cheeseburgers and a side of fries and one of onion rings.  The food was great.  We arrived early and by the time we left there was no inside seating left.  They have a large patio but that is not much help on a December evening.  They have enough floor space they could add a couple of small tables or high tops in the center but at peak it might interfere with folks getting to the condiment/soda station

Met up with some Yelpers here for a UYE.  A Saturday happy hour.  I was really surprised how few people were in the restaurant.  It really did not get busy until after happy hour was over.  With happy hour pricing on select drinks and appetizers it was quite affordable.  I had chicken wings and Brussels sprouts and shared a desert.  Everybody was happy with the food they got.  I had a couple of beers while some folks had wine or the drink of the day, which those who had it liked it.  Service was excellent the entire time.

I met fellow Yelpers here for a UYE.  Not an easy drive from Glendale on a Tuesday evening. But the time spent with friends was worth it. Parking is a problem here when they are busy and it was a packed house on this Tuesday evening. I forgot what beer I had, but I remember it was good!  I had the beer-braised 'n' Blue burger with onion rings.  Definitely high end stuff for bar food.  The only negative thing I noticed is we had a party of about a dozen and the place just doesn't work that well for large parties even though we had the largest table. Given the place was a packed bar the service could have been much worse.

Met some friends here for Smunch, my first trip to this outpost of the Vig.  Early on a Saturday parking was not an issue.  The patio with the outside bar was really nice on an early fall day.  The house itself just celebrated it's 100th birthday.  As usual the food at the Vig did not disappoint.  I had corned beef hash that lived atop a potato pancake.  The chunks of corned beef were tossed with peppers and onions that had a taste reminiscent of Ro-Tel, but not quite.  The two perfectly poached eggs were covered in a chipotle hollandaise sauce. Easily one of the best renditions of a corned beef hash I have had. The other six in our party were just as pleased with their food.  Service was great and the chef even spent a few moments at our table talking about some of the modifications we could ask for that were not noted on the menu, like he tries to keep a fresh can of bacon grease on the grill for those folks that want their food cooked in it.  He mentioned that after he overheard me talking about searing a medium rare filet in bacon grease in cast iron.

I've been to two parties here recently. I love the atmosphere.  Both times the wait staff knew what they were doing.  The beer list changes often but if you can even partially convey what you like you will find a beer that fits your taste being served to you.    I am somewhat less impressed with the food offerings. Good thing I went twice.  On my first visit I had the house burger and shared an order of garlic, herb and goat cheese tots.  Was not that impressed, especially at that price point.  If I was writing this review only on my first visit it would have been a 3.  On my second visit I shared a Spinach and Artichoke Grilled Cheese and a Green Chile Porker.  Both were much more imaginative and flavorful than the burger.

This was my first time at this location and was there with the ISCUYE.  I liked the layout of this one better than the one in Mesa. Cheryl B and I ordered the Pesto chicken and the Cajun chicken and swapped halves.  I think the Cajun (her choice) was a bit better but both were good.  For such a large group the service was very good. Parking turned out to be easy as there was space in the lot and on the streets.

So I lost my crawfish virginity. Decided I was glad I ordered shrimp, mainly because I liked the taste better.  I also split an order of crab.  A group is the best way to go here because that is the atmosphere created by everybody digging in with their hands and making a mess.  The food was great the service was great and they had Kiltlifter on tap. I not only want more of that shrimp, there are several other things I want to try on the menu.

I've been here a couple of times now for lunch.  I had been to the other location previously known as La Condesa once so I knew the food was going to be good.  And it certainly is.  Parking seems like it could be a hassle at times.  Another Yelper says they park at the school when it is not in session.  This time I noticed the back gate was open with an empty lot on the other side of the alley but my server could not tell me if it was ok to park there.  The salsa bar is always a delight and I try to limit myself to two per meal so I can keep track of what I am having.  Service both times has been OK but sort of an afterthought.  I will certainly keep this place in the lunch rotation.

It's probably not a 4 but it's got a cool factor that most places don't have.  The basis for all the buildings are shipping containers with a lot of modifications. Like much of Vegas it is an attempt to draw folks n to spend money at shops.  It was 110° the day my friend took me there to show it off so there was not much going on. My guess is it picks up in cooler temps.  It has play areas for the kids during the day and adults at night.  We picked up a couple of popsicles and rushed back to beat the parking meter.

As I was wandering through Fashion Square Mall I was hungry but it was hot out so I wanted something cool. I had never been to a Jamba Juice even though I live close to one.  I chose a drink based on the fact it had peaches in it.  Turned out it also had yellow vegetables which were no longer available so I was informed it would only be the fruits.  I asked if they had something green they could replace it with and she said they could throw in some kale.  Only a slight bitter of the kale came through and it was probably the healthiest thing I had on my whole trip to Vegas, and I liked it!

Met here for Smunch right about opening time.  Without even getting in to the food the feel of the place was great.  Spring was in the air and the doors were open to the patio with more seating out there.  Our service was great the whole time for a party of around 10.  We had a large enough group several items on the menu got tried.  I had the enchiladas and they let me have one of each.  They were both good.  Normally they serve it with both red and green sauce, next time I would ask for all red as I preferred it.  The salsas and guacamole were great.  The only thing lackluster to me was the beans.  Of those that had tacos it seemed like the fish came in last with shredded beef winning the day.  All of them were good, just in different degrees.  This is just a wonderful spot to gather on a spring day in Phoenix.

Stop number two on my eating summer vacation.  Joined by Arana W and Lisa E. With that company I could have forgotten all about being there to eat.  We shared an appetizer plate (Dad's grocery bag) while deciding what to have.  So we decided and our waiter came around and told us what the special was and I couldn't resist.  Turned out to be some the best grilled swordfish I had ever had, not sorry in the least I did not have the filet.  The service was as good as the food, excellent! Right from the start our waiter was there every time we needed him.  Wine samples, drink explanations, food questions.  Yes it is a mini Arizona chain, but the next level up, and certainly not for every day dining for my or most of my friends budgets.  And it certainly feels like a one of a kind.  But for me it was a rare weekday evening I was not constrained for time or mileage and really enjoyed it.

So I get this notice across Facebook that some of my friends want to go to the Sunday buffet here in about 2-1/2 hours. I really like Thai.   I had to call my help and tell her not to come in and went off to meet Monica, Rand and Norm.  What a lovely place to have lunch, or probably dinner too.  My favorite Thai dish is red curry with chicken and theirs is very good, with the heat level at medium which I like.  I tried several other dishes and liked every one.  The owners are super nice.  Keeping in mind this is a buffet, I know at least three of us tipped in the 18-25% range because of the quality of food and service and the value of the meal.

I had never been to a Yard House before. I was meeting a friend for dinner that worked across the street at the Forum Shops. We wandered along the way and picked this place to eat at. We were there during happy hour which I took advantage of for beer. I was set on having a steak so I ordered off the regular menu. My friend ordered several small plates off of the happy hour menu and I could see that was the way to go to try and sample a bunch of stuff at a reasonable price. I know it is a chain but I really liked the food and the service here.

I don't do heights or closed in spaces.  That out of the way, this ride was fantastic. I didn't have any panic at all.  I did stay back of the glass where it radiused out. I went early in the day.  There was no waiting and they were not even packing the cars in.  Got some beautiful pics of the area.

Went here for lunch with some friends that picked the restaurant.  They had been here before.  This was my first time at this location but had been to others on Sundays for football.  The whole atmosphere changes for weekday lunch.  I had the Black and Blue burger.  No choice in how it is cooked but it was juicy and quite tasty.  Food came out quickly and we were checked on frequently and our iced teas were kept filled.  If asked I would not hesitate to have a weekday lunch here again.

I've been a fan of the original store for years.  Lately I have been trying to watch what I eat so not much ice cream and had not yet visited this location.  Recently the stars aligned and I saw a post on their Facebook page about a special ice cream just for the weekend that was actually a recipe dreamed up by an employee and I was attending a brunch across the street on Saturday.  Habenero, bacon, avocado ice cream.  It even exceeded my high expectations.  I should point out I don't do a lot of heat, but the combination came out really good!  A couple more months and it will be time for fresh peach sourced from local farms.  I see another cheat day coming up. :)

Was here with friends for brunch. We had all sorts of different foods and I heard no complaints. My particular choice was a corned beef Reuben with a salad to replace the the fries. Quite often a switch like that gives you sort of a suggestion of a salad, this was a full on salad with a nice vinaigrette. And the sandwich was very good too. They had a nice selection of beers and any one of them was available in a 4oz glass by itself or in a flight. We had a party of 13 including 2 little ones and the service was very good. Definitely a place I would go back to.

I was meeting my friend Angela H for a late lunch and this was her suggestion.  And an excellent suggestion it turned out to be!  We chose to share small plates and our eyes wanted more than our stomachs had room for.  We had bacon jam, mac and cheese, gyro tacos and cheese fondue. It was all great! Early afternoon on a weekday it was busy but not packed.  Service was really good. We were catching up on stuff since we had last seen each other but we were never rushed to finish. I would definitely go here again.

This place is roughly a 45 minute drive each way. The first time I went was to meet up with friends after hearing about it. I've since been to a birthday party, twice just because I could convince somebody to meet me there and this last time all by myself. They have a large selection of beers, many of which are brewed on the premise. And to top it off they have really good food. I've sat on both patios and inside. The service is always friendly As long as it stays this way I'll keep making the drive.

Been here a few times now.  Being in groups I have gotten to try several different items.  All were OK most were very good.  Service has always been really good.  It stays busy, at least when I have been there, which leads to a good atmosphere.

Met some friends here for brunch. We got real lucky as we were a party of 12 and the big community high top had cleared just as we got there. The concept is fast casual and you move through the line pretty quick even on a busy Saturday. The black iced tea was OK. I had the Croque Madame. It looks deceptively small when plated but it was very filling and being made with 9 grain bread it made for a more relaxed eating pace, I loved it. I also got to try the breakfast wrap and it was good too. One of our party got an egg that was still clear and it was immediately cleared and a new plate brought out in short order. The owner/manager? came back twice to make sure their second try was acceptable. The servers were also the bussing staff and whatever else needed attention and it worked smoothly. The patio is dog friendly.

So we went to try the beer. They only have a few to choose from, not a problem. The variety is enough everybody found one to like.  The Wit I had was good enough to have a second. You can also get a flight. There are a few early video games and consoles spread out to play on that emphasize the 8-bit theme. They don't serve food but did not mind our group setting up a table with appetizers for our group. The place was spotless. The service was very friendly. If it wasn't so far out I wouldn't mind going another time to see what they have brewed.

Not a big pizza eater. I don't dislike it enough to go hungry if that is what is there. When I am eating pizza and I get to choose it will be a thin crust New York style. My friends, one from Chicago, said I had to try Malnati's deep dish pizza and it would change my whole outlook on pizza. It really didn't. I got to try the deep dish and the thin crust. I preferred the thin crust but, to me, still no wow factor.   I did get to order my favorite Italian dishes. A green salad and a bowl of pasta. Now we're talking! I got the small house salad and the Chicken Louie.The salad was fresh and the house house Red Wine Vinaigrette was good. The pasta was delicious. The 5 of us also shared a pizza cookie for desert. Speaking of sharing, people must eat more in Chicago.  I gave away 1/3 of my salad and still had plenty. I also gave up some samples of the pasta and still had enough for a really big lunch. Also nobody with the small deep dish pizzas were able to finish one. Suffice it to say you either bring a friend to share or plan on a carry out box.  You want to bring a friend or friends anyway. With a party of 5 we waited about 20 minutes for a table and then another 30-40 for the entrees. We got our drinks and salads/appetizers fairly quick. And dessert came about 10 minutes after we ordered it because it is baked as ordered too. All in all we were in the restaurant over 2-1/2 hours.  Service was really good.

So I'll probably not go here again. That has nothing to do with them, it's just not my kind of place. I've been conditioned over the years to see big plates of food. Not that I need them.  We went on Christmas eve and it was a pretty slow night for them.  From the moment we were greeted walking in the door to a short chat with one of the owners, Ray, on our way out the service was stellar. There was a long pause between the salad and the steak but we were busy talking anyway so it did not become awkward.  All of the food was well prepared and well plated. Very tasty stuff. And the bill was not out of line for the quality of service and food. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. I would have liked a little more light to read the menu, we ended up moving the candle around.

We were rather surprised when our group of 8 arrived and the place was not packed because of their 4-1/2 star rating. It did get busier as noon rolled around. Definitely a gem hidden in a strip mall. Within reason they will modify many of their dishes. Very good service. We had 8 different dishes and everybody loved what they ate. I had trouble finishing my red chicken enchilada entree as the portions were generous. We all found parking in front but there is a larger lot out back too.

This was actually my second time here. The first time was with a bunch of friends for lunch and it was really good. Yesterday Ashley S mentioned they were now open for breakfast so off I went. Got there just before 7 and were the first customers. Even though the forecast for the day was 117° it was still cool enough in the morning to enjoy the patio. I had a friend with me who had never been here. Because the breakfast menu was not yet on line I had to warn him I had no clue what I was dragging him in to. They have only been open for breakfast since Monday. Not to worry, I had Eggs Benedict and he had Huevos Rancheros and they were both great. Speaking of great, the coffee is excellent. I always drink mine black and my friend cut way back on his cream and sugar so he could get more coffee flavor. I really have enjoyed both of my visits here and being only a couple of miles away I am sure I will come again.

Looking for a place to meet up for lunch I had not been to. It had to be near the paths we were running to get stuff done. My friend had been here before and it sounded like a place we could eat quickly and get back on our separate ways. We got here just as they opened the doors at 11. The place was clean. The friendly owner took our orders and shortly our dogs came out. A really good dog on a fresh baked bun smothered in Mac and cheese and dog sauce garnish. With a choice of cole slaw or chips I thought the $5.95 price was real reasonable. It's good to have a different option in my hood.

Met up with some folks for a UYE. I had never had poke before but have had raw fish in other forms. I got the large size on a salad base with tuna, shrimp, salmon and avocado. For my dressing I chose spicy creamy. I could have done well with just a medium but I managed to eat the whole plate. It helped that it was very good. They actually serve it in the to go container so I imagine quite a few people don't finish it while there. I know at least two at our table got a bag to carry the container out in. Service was quick and friendly. Of course everything was spotless. There is a mixture of seating types. We took over an entire community table and grabbed an extra chair.

My friend Monica O just got ROTD for the original Chandler location. The name sounded familiar and sure enough I had been driving past the new Glendale location on a regular basis. Not a huge wing fan but I like them on occasion. I looked on line and saw they had a salad on their menu. Who can say no to a green salad with tasty chicken chunks? The flavor I chose, with a little help from behind the counter, was citrus chipotle. Excellent choice, a little sweet, a little spicy. The staff was upbeat and joking with the customers. It was lunch time and a line to the door and they didn't skip a beat. Plenty of parking. The restaurant was clean. Even though it is highly visible, several restaurants have failed here. I hope this one sticks.

Recently went here with the Breakfast Club for a UYE. Service was great the entire time. The restaurant was not that busy as we got there right as they opened for brunch. I think our group of 10 may have been the only table our server had at the time.  I shared with a friend the Fried Green tomato Benedict and a Dutch pancake which is sort of a pastry cup in this case filled with mashed potatoes, corn, fried chicken strips and topped with gravy.  Both were very good.  While not inexpensive or hugely filling the meals were reasonably priced for the quality and the overall atmosphere.
