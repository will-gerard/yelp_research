I'm not the type of person to grade on a curve  or give reviews for places like Denny's. It's either pretty good, or a pretty bad experience...  Caramba's has been a quick, consistent stop for years to get a good fix of moderately priced Mexican food. Well things have been slowly sliding downhill for the last couple years. It's getting a little run down. And, the owners are not very attentive anymore. The consistency is now completely out the window. The portion size is hit or miss. About 40% of the time I am very disappointed. Some part of the order is either wrong or not made properly. As long as I stick with things like taco's, cheese crisp, or salads where I can see everything I ordered when I pick it up. Things are somewhat ok.. I just ordered a fajita burrito and counted 7 layers of tortilla over the whole top of the wrap. all of the way across and 3 layers on the bottom. I kept hoping somewhere in there I was going to find some meat. Well there was very, very little. And at over $10 wet with guacamole. (which comes with it if you don't order enchilada sauce) it wasn't cheap. The way things are now with consistency. The quirky things like charging for soda refills, having to ask for napkins, and the bland salsa bar are annoying. Remembering how things were years ago, I keep wanting to give them another chance. But, it will be a long time before that happens again..

Excellent Latin restaurant near 43rd ave and Bell rd.. behind the Taco Bell  small family run Ecuadorian, Peruvian, and Columbian style Cafe. the Tamales are among the best I have had.. I had a combination plate with Carne Asada, whole beans, fried plantains, a sausage, a slice of deep fried pork belly with skin, a plantain fritter, a fried egg, rice, avocado, and aji relish. the whole beans were amazing.  the ahi chili relish hot and tasty. the steak had just the right amount of seasoning and flavor. A huge amount of food. Give Mi Comida a try. Your tummy will be happy.

Went to China King for a Dim Sum lunch today. I ordered, Tofu Skin rolls with sauce (my favorite), Siu Mai (Shumai), pan fried noodle, rice noodle roll with beef, and a type of shrimp dumpling. Everything was very good, fresh, and more then enough food for two people. I would suggest arriving pretty much right at 11am when they open.  that's when the carts are loaded and it will ensure hot, just out of the kitchen dumplings. Also if you do a little research online before you go. So that you know what to order. That helps a lot too. They don't have the laminated flash cards with english explanations for what each of the dumplings and dishes are. There are many dishes they can do that are not normally on the cart, Like the pan fried noodle. Or, Chinese doughnut with rice noodle. Order... Don't wait for the cart !!  I don't know of anywhere else in Phoenix that does Dim Sum like this. If you do let me know. And, if anyone knows where to get real soup dumplings (soup inside the dumpling) definitely pass that along too.. China King is worth a try..

Consistently good Korean food. One of the few places that does Stone Bowl Kalbi Dolsot Bibim Bap well.. the stone bowl is hot enough when the dish is made that it fries the rice along the bowl. the result is crunchy rice that you can scrape off of the hot bowl after eating the vegetables, and sweet rib meat. I'm sure it makes doing the dishes no fun. But, for the customer it's totally worth it.

I have to say Yen Sushi has disappointed me every time I've been there.   The Happy Hour is cheap with five dollar California Rolls and Sake bombers. Your going to need the Sake Bombers.. As far as the Sushi....  unfortunately, even five dollars is expensive for what you get.  The portions are large enough.  Trouble is, the quality of ingredients is what really suffers here.  Frozen low quality fish, overcooked low quality rice, poor kitchen prep, and even worse quality control..   I had a burnt spider roll that was completely inedible. One very small very burned soft shelled crab..  Overcooked, just like the rice that is used to make most of the sushi. can you say " cookie dough "  Those who really know the difference sushi grade rice can make..  will be just as disappointed as I am.  I've eaten here 10 to 15 times at least.  So, one would think I would've been satisfied on at least one visit.  I wasn't..

Incredible Flan.. if you know Cuban food it won't be hard to navigate the menu. If you don't.. share a Cuban sandwich with a friend. Watch the other tables to see what others are asking for. Especially the small plates.. when you see one you like, give it a try. After, a good conversation with your friend order a coffee and desert. Maybe, Cafe cubano and Flan. This restaurant is more Homestyle then Taxi stand. it represents everything a Cuban restaurant should. Sharing a good conversation and some good food. Did I mention they have really good Flan? it tastes sweet where it's supposed to and doesn't where it's not... worth a try

This place is what a bike shop is all about. they genuinely enjoy bicycles and bicycle people and that's because they are bike people.

I let the chef make the decisions and ordered Omakase.. the handling of the fish and attention to detail were promising quantity was adequate for the amount spent but not generous. bottom line overall it was pretty good but no where near as good as say Harumi.. However the one thing that really turned me off was that a single Sake Bomber with very very low quality sake ended up costing $12 during reverse Happy Hour. Yeah thats right better then $10 or more then double what I pay ever where else.. Yellowtail looked promising. But, there is no way I will be back after that..

Japanese fried skewers, Tempura, pressed box sushi, and rice..... An excellent ethnic dining experience not to be missed.  There might be another Kushi Age restaurant in maybe..  Los Angeles.  Other then that your not going to find anything like this here in the USA  Very traditional method of cooking various things in very hot oil that have been coated with freash made Panko flakes. In Japan a Kushi Age place would be very small and probably very old. At Yu Yu's you find the familiar feel of a Sushi restaurant.  Of course, the food is very different. items are served in small quantities of usually  two skewers for each item ordered. You can let the Chef make all of the decisions by ordering the chef's choice. All of the different types of chicken skewers were excellent with good quality chicken and expert prep. the various vegetables available were interesting and very fresh. Expertly cooked. A wide range of sauces and seasoned salts were also very good.. The skewers came out at a nice pace that lets you enjoy each flavor without having to rush for fear of some of the food getting cold.. They also do some sashimi, noodles, Katsu Don, and another thing very hard to find in the US..  Battera..  japanese pressed box sushi  Worth a try if you love Japanese food as much as I do !! experiment and put the time in to find what you like. You will be rewarded with a great experience and become a fan of skewers too..

A great local Sushi restaurant that deserves a try... I've never been disappointed, always good food for a good price. great care is taken with how the fish is handled and prepared. And they have a lot of ingenuity and experience in the kitchen.

Sushi Catcher has become a home away from home.. I always get a great meal for a great price.  The value is only exceeded by how welcome I feel every time I eat here. I don't hand out too many 5 star ratings.  Well, this wonderful family operated business deserves every one of them. I don't even look at a menu anymore. I just trust  KC and Sue to take very good care of me..

I'm very sorry to say Sushi Catcher has again changed owners. I've given this new staff a couple of chances and things went from bad to worse. ordered 3 rolls and when they came out one was the wrong one. I mentioned that I had ordered something different. The reply was interesting to say the least.  "You don't want" I remarked that I wasn't looking to get "something for nothing" and that he would not need to remake the roll.. This guy then stops making Sushi and goes and checks the ticket and charges me for the more expensive roll...  the extra $2-3 bucks is not that big of a deal. The lack of quality for the food was. The rice is of a much cheaper quality. It is also now very overcooked and mushy. He is not stingy with it thou. the ratio of rice to fish for the rolls has gone thru the roof. the portion of fish has gone down and the portion of rice has gone up. in fact the simple and small Salmon roll that used to be so delicious is now a pinwheel. a quick recap fish portions are now much smaller     the crab mix for the California rolls has changed the rice is now of a lower quality and is over cooked the Nori is no longer very fresh.. it is chewy and not crisp as it should be the skill set at the Sushi knife has dropped remarkably. .. I don't care how inexpensive it gets..  I will not be going back

Excellent Vietnamese food inside Lee Lee's market 75th & Cactus.. Peoria I used to drive the 45+ mins to eat at Phu Thanh in Mesa and loved their food. unfortunately that restaurant closed 6 months ago. Well the family has opened a new restaurant here in Peoria.    The best Pho I've found in Phoenix. They will make it any way you like. Rare beef on the side, steamed mung sprouts. extra noodle, Whatever condiments a true Pho lover would want. They will make it happen. The key is knowing what you want. and, not expecting someone to read your mind..  The herb pouch they use for the broth has the perfect blend of savory and sweet. One of the best things about their broth is how the flavor stays consistent all the way 'til your done. Truly a rare thing...  Banh Xeo is filled with fresh veggies and a few shrimp. Cut off some of this crispy crepe and add some fresh basil, cucumber, fish sauce, and roll it into an awesome lettuce wrap. This is good healthy eats !! Their Iced Coffee is top notch too.. They make all the various Vietnamese Sweet Bean, and tapioca desserts.  Trust me those are worth a try.. Pho Tan Thanh..  I look forward to rediscovering your extensive menu Soup Stew Noodle Broken Rice Meat Grills and wraps Pho Tan Thanh has it covered

Finally... Pizza in Phoenix that has good crust ! Best Pizza I've had in Phoenix for quite some time.  They make the pasta for the Ravioli and Lasagna in house. Good sauce. Good meatballs. Innovative take on Brushetta. Experienced staff. They will have a full bar available by the end of November. I look forward to exploring the menu.. Worth a try.

A family run Ramen shop serving handmade noodle with a good complex broth. The kitchen shows Ramen experience that I haven't seen in Phoenix before. They have Asahi Super Dry on tap and a good selection of sake.. it's the real deal and worth a try.
