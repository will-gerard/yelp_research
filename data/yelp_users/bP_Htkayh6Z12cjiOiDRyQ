Stephanie is an AMAZING hairstylist. Not only is she a total sweetheart, but she explains the whole process to you as she washes, cuts, and styles your hair. I had really long, unhealthy, heavy hair and just wanted to be free of it. I told Stephanie the length I wanted to get to, and instead of cutting 6 inches off right away, she went an inch at a time, showing me where the length was at with each cut, so I knew how much was being cut off at a time - juuuust in case I changed my mind about going as short as I originally planned. As they say, it is much easier to take away than it is to add, especially when it comes to hair, and I loved this approach.  I also expressed to her my desire to master the "beach wave" look with a flat iron. Stephanie went step by step with me and taught me how to use a flat iron to create beachy waves on my new 'do, explaining to me how I needed to hold the flat iron differently for different parts of my hair, and the best products to use to keep the look strong all day. I left there feeling SO happy with my new hairstyle. It feels so healthy and new, and the cut is just adorable! Thank you Stephanie! I will definitely be recommending you to others, and I will be back!!!

I spent $67 at the Valvoline on Cave Creek Road yesterday and I walked about completely frustrated and upset.   I've been to this location a few times for a quick oil change or free top-off, and every time it has been a positive experience...until yesterday.   I went into this location yesterday around 4:00. There was one free bay out of the three, and one woman and her 2 kids in the waiting room waiting for their car to be finished. I walked in, and one of the associates came in twice to talk to the woman, not once acknowledging me or asking if I had been helped. This happened a total of four times. Once the woman's car was finished, they came in, walked her out to her vehicle, and by then all bays were empty. There were about 5 employees in the bay areas and not one of them came into the waiting room to see if I had been helped. I was the only customer there. I received a phone call and stepped outside and ended up having to leave for a bit.   I called from home right after that to see what time they closed and if they were currently busy. They didn't close for about two hours but when I said I was going to come in for an oil change the guy on the other line sounded frustrated with a tone of "I guess we can get you in...", as if it was a huge inconvenience.   Turns out it would be this guy that I would end up talking to once I brought my car in. Drove it up onto the bay and they began doing the point inspection. The manager (I was told by the disgruntled employee doing the computer work that he was the manager) went to lift my hood and I hear him say something about my windshield wipers needing replaced. I just bought these windshield wipers 2 months ago, and knew for a fact they were not in bad shape.   The employee looks at me and says, "my manager says your windshield wipers are shot and you need new ones." I told him I just bought new ones, he looks at them himself and goes, "uh, yeah, you definitely don't need new ones...I'm a terrible salesman."  Then they proceed to tell me I have tail/brake lights that are out. I said I will get them fixed later to avoid more charges. Later on when I went home, a friend and I checked all of my lights, blinkers, etc. and they all work PERFECTLY FINE.   I then also made the mistake of actually paying $25 for a tire rotation. There are plenty of other places that will do it for free with a standard oil change. I knew it needed to be done but I regret not waiting to get it for free somewhere else or having a friend do it. Especially after I was completely ripped off here. I have a bad feeling that my tire rotation wasn't even completed.   Once they come into the waiting room and tell me my car is all ready, charge me and lead me out the door, I see an employee checking my tires with a curious look on his face. Before I get in my car he tells me to hold on a second. He then goes to the other employees and they start whispering about something and I ask if everything is okay. He then goes "when you start to drive, can you let me know if it feels funny? Like something is grinding on the front driver tire?"  I was absolutely furious at this point. It felt fine, and I told him that, but I will be having someone else look at it to see if there are any issues with my tires, and if there are I will surely be connecting the problem to this location. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had at a service shop. I was lied to multiple times about my lights and windshield wipers, and I feel like I was completely ripped off.

BRENNAN'S IS THE BEST! What an awesome place to come and chill with my dear friends. Not to mention the staff is the best. Jaki, Wayne, Kat - all of them!

I'm not sure why I keep going back to this location. The food is good, but it's not so great when it takes 45 minutes to get on a Tuesday night when my server only has 2 other tables. Then when we asked for the check it took another 20 minutes for that! Every single time I come here the service is either slow, or the servers are extremely passive and rude. I likely won't be coming back. The staff is lucky I am a server as well and believe in karma or else I would have left close to nothing for a tip.

Went in today to get two new tires after I found a nail on the side wall of one of my rear ones. Showed up at 5:15 and was out the door by 5:45.  Kyle was awesome and helped get me some tires that were better than the lower quality ones I was going to get for just six bucks more. So that was awesome. Overall a good, quick experience. Will definitely be back for a rotation, inspection, etc. when needed.

I had to get some keys copied for my office door and Wal-Mart couldn't copy the specific shape of key, and neither could Home Depot, so they recommended us to this place.   We walked in and I showed the guy at the front desk (I assume he is the owner) the key and said I would like 2 copies. The key says "do not duplicate" on it, and since Home Depot and Wal Mart didn't even bother to acknowledge that, I figured this guy would just ask what it was for, and once I told him an office door, all would be well. I had my boss' company credit card with me, as some sort of proof of where I worked or whatever, and was going to show him.   Before I could even open my mouth, the man started rudely asking me things like "how do I know you're even authorized to copy this key? How do I know where you work? I don't know who you are, I don't know who your boss is."  Each time I tried to tell him where I worked and that I had the company credit card, he interrupted me and was almost grilling me. Finally I showed him the card and all of a sudden he was nice. Took the key from me and copied it. Once he came back to cash me out he was all polite and had a total change of attitude. But I was so thrown off by his interrogation I wasn't sure what to do.  I paid for the copied keys and went on my way. My coworker that was with me noticed the same attitude and we both agreed as soon as we left the store that the man was extremely rude.   I probably wouldn't find myself back there for any other reason in the future, but if I need a key copied that Home Depot or Wal Mart can't do, I'll go somewhere besides this place, even if just to avoid the rude service.

I ordered delivery and it got to my house within an hour, like they quoted me. I was pretty excited because I had been craving Pad Thai for weeks. When I opened it up, it LOOKED delicious. I went to take a portion from the to-go container and put it onto my plate, but the noodles were so dry that the ENTIRE serving of Pad Thai noodles stayed together in one big clump. I tried a bite to see if maybe it wasn't as dry as it seemed, and boy was it dry. And flavorless! I took a couple of bites and threw it away. It was like eating paper. Waste of my money.

My review is based on the service. The food was fine, as it always has been. The service has been either so-so or bad every time I've gone, so I have taken the hint and will likely not be going back.  I went to meet a friend at Upper Crust last week, and we got there at about 8:00 p.m. It was a Tuesday and was empty in the lounge except for two people sitting at the bar, so we sat in a booth off to the side. It took a few minutes for someone to come over to us, which was no big deal, as I noticed the bartender was busy speaking to a customer about something, but did not see a server anywhere.   After a few minutes a server (I think his name was John? Jim? A tall, slender young guy), came up and greeted us asking us for our drink order. I was trying to decide on a glass of wine so he said he would be back with two waters that we asked for. We didn't see him again for about 6-7 minutes.   He came back with our waters, got my wine order, came back with the glass of wine, and said he would "be right back" to get our food order even though our menu's were closed and we were clearly ready to order. I would've understood if he had a busy section, but we were the only table sitting in the entire area. The restaurant side was empty as well.  After about 10 minutes he finally showed back up again to take our order. Once our food was ready he dropped it off but we did not see him again for another 25-30 minutes. The bartender obviously noted his absence as he came up to us to check on us saying he had no idea where our server is but wanted to make sure we were okay. Any interaction with him was sort of slow and tired on his part, and it was pretty awkward, especially when he came back to our table reeking of cigarettes.  I hate to pull the "I work in a restaurant" card because I know how annoying that can be, but from working in a restaurant for so long I guess I notice these things and they disappoint me, especially when I feel that everyone deserves a tip, but shouldn't feel entitled to it and should take at least some sort of pride in their job.

Just a heads up, their online ordering system may be having some issues, and if you don't create an account to order online, your order may never go through. It only takes 2 minutes to create an account, and it's worth it. After eating Jimmy John's religiously, I decided to try something new that I hadn't tried before - Capriotti's. I am a sucker for Italian-style sandwiches at all kind of shops like this, so I ordered the Grilled Italian sandwich. Delivery estimated time was 12:40, and my sandwich got here at about 1 p.m., so 20 minutes late, but hey, it got here, so I guess I can't complain too much. Even the smallest size is HUGE! Overall, the sandwich is good. Could use some lettuce, but there is a good amount of meat and cheese to make it good. I added mayo (weird, maybe?) to add some sauciness to it, and honestly, I'm glad I did. I feel like it would've been dry without it, even with the Italian oils. Would definitely try again!

Rude service. Got a warranty fix done and they fixed the problem and did the point inspection. I drove away and my car was making a funny noise. I lifted the hood to see that they didn't even put the air filter cover back on. As in, it wasn't even PLACED on, it was off to the side.

Writing my initial review from the lobby. I'm sitting on the bench inside waiting for a friend/waiting for a table. Stood by the host desk for a few minutes, no one came up. I've now been sitting here for 8 minutes and 4 employees have passed me. Not one has asked if I need something. Hopefully the burgers at this location is good.

I was going against the negative reviews, which I've learned tonight I should never do again. I literally just had food from Classic Crust delivered to my door 10 minutes ago  - yes, 10 minutes ago. I've been craving fettuccine Alfredo all day long and I was so excited to get this, but what I opened was a thing of dry noodles with MAYBE a tablespoon of Alfredo sauce. So basically I paid for dry noodles. I thought maybe I would find salvation in the Caesar salad but that was ruined ALSO, because it basically is drenched in the dressing so much that the lettuce is wilted. With two strikes on the board I thought maybe I would just have dessert for dinner I guess, and enjoy this zeppoli, since everyone talks so highly about them. I'm wondering if it's employees and owners that are writing the reviews because what I have in front of me right now is balls of chewy dough that's ridiculously difficult to eat. I'm very upset that I just wasted $25. And I'm still starving.

I give 5 stars for the shopping experience, since I always can find something, even if i wasn't looking for it, and it's always at a great price. However, my review is about the selling at this location. Three times I've brought in a bag of very nicely folded, practically brand new (some stuff actually brand new still with tags), style-appropriate clothing based on what they look for, and it's almost like they don't bother to even look through the bag. Last time it took them 5 minutes to return my huge bag to me, which had about 30 items in it. They claimed they wouldn't take the clothes because "although they were in great condition, they aren't the kind of styles they sell at Plato's Closet." Here's what's funny - about 90% of the items in that bag were PURCHASED AT THIS LOCATION. And as I look through the racks of clothing, some things I do come across make me think "this looks so worn it's about to fall apart!" Yet you see it on the sale rack. Hm. I am currently looking for a place to sell my basically new clothing that actually has logic behind their policy.

I just moved in 5 days ago, but so far I am LOVING it. Holy goodness what an upgrade from my last place. I have a Platinum 1x1 apartment and it is BEAUTIFUL. I absolutely love all of the windows and the layout. So far my experience is a pleasant one - it is a quiet complex and my parking spot is close to door, so that is a huge plus in comparison to my last place where I literally had to walk 10 minutes to my parking spot. Jillian in the office has been fantastic also!
