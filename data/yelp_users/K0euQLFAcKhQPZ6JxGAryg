Hmmm...interesting.  My first nightclub experience in Phoenix.  We were originally supposed to go to Oaxaca for Caribbean Night, but when we got there it was dead *crickets*.  Lots and lots of people here!  Being from NY, I'm used to a very diverse crowd in lounges/clubs so it was weird partying in a place with only one demographic... I love dance music so I dragged my friend over into that room, but we actually spent more time in the salsa/bachata room because it had great ambiance and was filled with so much energy.

I didn't expect to find a church when I moved out here.  I checked out a few Christian churches,  even some spiritual centers but nothing resonated with me.  I was born and raised Catholic, so because of that some Protestant churches just don't work for me.  Sorry, I'm just not into all that hooting and hollerin' (or the threats of hell and damnation)!  I'm also very spiritual (not necessarily religious), so I can be wary of religious zealots.  But I've always been open to trying new churches out; so when my classmate invited me to come to hers, I thought sure why not!  Well let me tell you, I was hooked from day one.  FCC is uplifting, delightful and there is lots of praise singing.  You can't help but join in!  It is a non-denominational, multicultural church.  The Sunday service is held at Saguaro High School at 10am.  Praise & worship singing goes on until about 10:30.  They also have bible study/service at 7pm on Wednesdays at their Phoenix location.  FCC is very welcoming and has such a cute way of welcoming new visitors.    Every so often, a new topic will be presented as part of a new series.  It will be discussed for several Sundays/Wednesdays in a row.  Afterwards, you can purchase the recordings in mp3/CD for safe-keeping.  The "Sex" series had just started when I began attending.  I was really impressed with how Pastor Moore handled the topic: he was very open, frank and respectful.  Any children present were ushered into another room, so adults could feel free to enjoy this topic.  I think it is a challenge for many Christians to follow God's word while traversing this terrain called "Earth".  I found this series extremely helpful to me and anyone wishing to maintain closeness to God.  Speaking of children, they have their own program on Sundays in another part of the building.  I think this is really beneficial for them, allowing them to grow in their own faith with their peers.  They have the opportunity to start developing relationships with like-minded individuals.  This year celebrates FCC's 15th anniversary so they just held a 3-day celebration.  And...I just officially took steps to become a member.  I begin membership classes next month!  Stop by and give it a go!

I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered a 10-inch pizza with breaded eggplant and artichokes.  It was soooo good!  This pizza definitely reminded me of home!  Shoutout to my Yelp friend Ebony W.  It was her check-in that sparked my curiosity to try this spot :)  Ooh and they have locations throughout the valley.  I will have to try the Scottsdale location next!

In just a few short days, I've fallen in love with this place.  I wanted to come here for a while so when I saw the Groupon, I jumped at the chance.  As a Caribbean girl, I love the down home feel and the generous portions (pero un peque√±o caro).  Also, everyone here is really nice!  I love Cuban food and am very familiar with it being from a neighboring island (Haiti).    Everything I've tried here so far has been really delicious!  So far I've had the Cho Cho (yeah for a veggie dish), Frituras de Frijoles Negros, Sangria soda, some nectars, Tres leche, Pudin de Pan con Chocolate, and of course Maduros Fritos!!!  I suggested the Chicharrones de Pollo for my friend who was unfamiliar with Cuban food and she loved it.  We came here two days in a row.... (sigh) I am slowly becoming addicted!!

Probably my favorite airport to date.  The employees are warm and welcoming.  There is never a crazy line at security.  On Thanksgiving there was no line at security!  Kudos just for that.  On the down side: restaurants close early, getting around the airport is super confusing, and chuck the annoying guys working outside the terminal.

I dig this place.  I have been here SO many times for falafel.  The employees are really friendly (sometimes flirty lol) and the food is so filling!  Great prices and great food.  They even sell henna here!  They regularly cater meetings/events at my school.  This was actually the first restaurant I frequented in the Tempe area.  Their yellow rice, hummus and guava juice are mmm mmm good!

Ok folks, I think we have a winner!  If you've read my other reviews, you would know that I've been on the hunt for a good Chinese restaurant since I moved to AZ from NY.  Golden Gate has a beautiful decor.  The owner Sue is so elegant and charming.  She's been in business for 24 years and very proud of that fact.  Can you blame her?  The options are plentiful.  This place is really a "have it your way" establishment.  You can substitute tofu instead of meat for virtually any dish and can substitute veggie fried rice instead of white for 50 cents.  A little pricey, but the food is fresh and they give plenty of it.   I have enough for leftovers.  I was able to add broccoli to my meal and they actually know how to fry tofu correctly!   They even slipped in a nice little bag of crispy wonton chips!  Thanks Yelpers for helping me find this place!

I am comparing this to my experience with the Scottsdale Quarter store and even the New York Roosevelt Field location.  My laptop had crashed and I had to set up an appointment for an apple store.  I had no idea there was another store closer to me in scottsdale because I had just moved to the area.  I waited at this location for hours before I was seen (yes I know they are busy), but it even took long to pick up my computer.  The Scottsdale Quarter got down to the reason why this kept happening (3 times) and wouldn't give up until they found out why.  It turned out to be an external component I was using.  The Genius reps were nice enough but the Chandler location never tried to find out why this kept happening and left me scratching my head.  In my experience, this location just didn't go above and beyond which is what I expect from apple stores.

Yes, Yes and Yes!  Went on a Friday around 12:30p for my favorite meal: brunch!  My brother had pancakes, eggs and sausage.  I had choc chip walnut pancakes with eggs and potatoes. YUM! We both enjoyed our meals very much.  Staff was super nice, great experience.  I guess I found my go to brunch spot in Scottsdale :)

I've now been to this place a total of 4 times since moving to the phoenix area.  I have even visited the other location in Mesa.  I seem to have a preference for this Scottsdale location.  It's more laid back and it still holds a special place in my heart as my first brunch spot in AZ.  On one visit, I had the florentine eggs benedict.  That was a bit runnier than I like, but it was still tasty.   On my last visit, I had the Four Peaks Fruity French Toast.  It was out of this world! I'll definitely get that again!  Like every single thing I've had here is good!  I love this place!

WOW! I had such an amazing experience here last night...  I had finished some shopping and recognized the name on the sign from a yelp review I had checked out just a few days earlier.  I wasn't sure if I was in a salad mood, but the scenario was way too serendipitous to pass up.  I was a little confused upon entering on where to start, but one of the servers showed me the ropes.  He was so sweet.  I loaded up on salad!  Wonderful selection of toppings.  After that I hit up the soup bar, pizza and desert only taking a little of each.  All of this for $11? Thank you God! I wish I could eat a lot because I would tear this place up!    The servers were really kind always checking to see if I was finding everything ok.  I haven't been this catered to in a buffet ever!  Abraham is such a sweetheart!  Be sure to tip before you leave, they work hard up in there!   I can't wait to take my NY friends here when they come visit!

A shoe lover's paradise! I cannot believe the amount of shoes they have here, even sneakers.  In some sizes the sneakers had to be stacked on top of each other!  Lots of boots on clearance since the summer is coming.  I liked the setup of the store and that there weren't many people there.  I didn't get a chance to look at the clothes because I was there strictly for shoes, but I'll definitely be back!

Love this place even more than before.  Best NR in Phoenix area (Been to the ones in Chandler and Phoenix proper).  Helpful staff, lots of clearance and lots of bras and shoes in my size.  Parking is not incredibly desirable as this is a popular shopping area.    I just signed up for the Nordstrom Debit Card which links to your checking account so that you can earn points towards rewards.  They even went back into my account to make sure I got credit for the points I previously earned before signing up.  I love the employees that walk around the store who you can use to check out.  Incredible solution to unnecessarily long holiday lines!

I am so happy there is a FedEx (Kinkos) location that stays open 24 hours in my area.  My laptop crashed and I needed to register for classes the very next morning (my classmates are sharks for those coveted lab spots)!  I arrived at 5:40am (3/5/2012) and was greeted by a very pleasant employee.  He made sure I was set up on the computer and good to go.  The internet ran a little slower than mine at home, but I was very thankful for their services.

This was my second visit to this location.  As stated in my quick tips, the lady I encountered working at the smoothie bar is not the friendliest.    LET'S BE CLEAR: The smoothies are YUMMY!.  I just don't like this location.  It is sub-par for what I've come to expect of Whole Foods.  And it doesn't help that the location on Mayo Blvd in Phoenix is incredible.  I will continue going there for the amazing customer service, variety of products and samples.

What can I say about Applebee's?  It's an American chain restaurant.  Food options are standard fare.  Their Spinach & Artichoke Dip is what had me coming here back in the day but now my palate has matured.  REALLY nice servers tho.  The Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae is the best thing I've had here; albeit overpriced in comparison to similar desserts around town.

Love this Sunflower.  The bodycare section is unreal!  They have some of my favorites like Devita, Himalaya and Goat Milk Soap.  They also have a large selection of supplements.  As much as I love Scottsdale, this Sunflower has that location beat due to size and variety.  Don't forget to check the clearance bin!

First time at this location.  Very cool laid back environment.  I LOVE that they did a gazillion free chocolate chip cookie runs throughout the restaurant while we were there!  And Sweet Tomatoes chocolate chip cookies are some of the best I've ever had.  My friends and I stayed quite a while here.  Great place to study and just chillax.  Really nice staff.  Make sure to check your weekly flyer for coupons!

Ooooo Boy! Had a lot of fun shopping here this past weekend.  People have no clue that Burlington has more than coats.  But that's A-OK cuz that leaves more for me! :D Lots & lots of things to pick thru.  Yummy accessories (shoes, sunnies and jewelry)! The only disappointment was the undergarments.  Ugh, they were a mess.  The bras were all out of order and not enough bras in my size *sad face*.  However, if you're a 40D, have at it!lol

I must send a special thank you to Mark for taking time out of his day to revive my stereo! A week prior to this, I was driving and it just stopped working. I thought I might need a new unit, so I decided to shop some prices. Based on SGTM's good reviews, I decided to stop in.  Mark took the time out to ask me a few questions about my unit, then went out to my car with me. He simply reset the unit and I was back in business!  :-)

I can't believe a place like this exists!  So cool!  I got a Fuzzy Navel shaved ice with Tropic creme. SO good! This shaved ice is indeed different.  It was so smooth!  My friends got the Orange Cruiser and Wavebender.  We all loved our treats! CASH ONLY tho - it's how they keep the prices low! :D

Much busier this year as compared to the last time I came 3 yrs ago. More vendors also. Some of the vendors can charge on the pricier end requiring 7+ more tickets. There should be more sample size portions for 5 tickets or less. I liked that they had more beverage stations this time, so you didn't have to walk to far to quench your thirst! One request: can we get more vegetarian/Vegan options! Weather was perfect, music was fun, had a great time.

{Actual Date of Visit: 12/25/2011}  I like the other yelper (below) chose Tottie's for Christmas dinner.  When I arrived, I was told it was a 20 min wait for takeout.  Seriously???  Just as I was told this, I saw others walk in and were immediately seated.  I was really hungry so I decided to eat there hoping my food would get to my belly quicker.  I sat at the bar and ordered my meal.  They were definitely understaffed.  I watched as one very dramatic patron complained about how long it was taking to get her food.   The food took a really long time, but  I was satiated with my appetizer of veggie spring rolls.  I had never had cold spring rolls but I enjoyed them.  The Szechwan Style Bean Curd was flavorful and the portion was generous. Unfortunately the experience wasn't enough to make me wanna run back and eat here.  Oh...and If you wrap my spring rolls up to go, wouldn't you think to wrap up the tasty peanut sauce that came with it??? Maybe it's just me...

I was dreading getting a replacement cartridge for my printer at $40 a pop.  I decided to suck it up and get the combo pack for $50.  When I arrived at the register, Cristina the store manager told me about a coupon I was eligible for that had just come out!  Saving me money is a quick and easy way to win me over!  I have been here a few times before and was treated pretty well also.  Keep up the good work!

In November, I was maid of honor in my best friends wedding. I hadn't tried on my dress in a few weeks, so I didn't realize I couldn't wear the strapless bra I had intended on wearing with it bc it would show. The day before I left for the Caribbean, I tried it on. Oopsies! It wasn't horrible, but it was a little loose. Wanting to prevent any "wardrobe malfunctions",  I called Phil (on a Mon at 9am) and asked if I could bring the dress in for slight tweaking in the bust area. After some "last minute" teasing, he told me I could bring it right over! He had it ready for me that afternoon! It fit perfectly! My previous visit, I had a vintage leather skirt altered at a great price. There were places quoting me up to $45 just to take it in!    Ladies & gentlemen, never underestimate the power of a good tailor! The seamstresses work very hard and the owners are friendly and patient in ensuring the perfect fit!

Really cool spot.  I can't say that I'm an avid consignment/vintage shopper, but I'd been hearing about this place since I moved to Scottsdale.  I went on a weekday afternoon.  The girls working were very helpful even though they were pretty busy.  I actually found a few really nice items with tags still on.  They have a lot of unique items.  Kind of a skimpy shoe selection, but lots of cute designer bags.  I will definitely be back.

I've been going to Bell Auto Service for about a year now and am very pleased.  It started with a Napa AutoCare Center Living Social voucher for $49 which included: 3 Oil Changes, Tire Rotation, 120-pt inspection, Battery & Charging System Check, & One Year Roadside Service Membership - (yeah all of that).  As a woman, you are always tentative to go to a new shop for fear of being taken advantage of.  Quite the contrary here!  It is a family owned shop and environment.  Everyone is helpful and friendly.  I think I've met everyone by now, lol.  On my 2nd oil change, they discovered I had a nail in my tire and recommended a spot up the block to plug up my tire.  More recently, my car was leaking oil, so I called to see if they could squeeze me in.  My schedule is really ugly, but they managed to fit me in to take a look to make sure it wasn't a dangerous situation.  When I arrived, Terry took a look and confirmed I was indeed leaking oil.  Since it was late in the day, he added some oil and fit me in early the next week.  Needless to say, they hooked me up!  I am so appreciative to Bell Auto Service for their good work.  They are a God-send for a student on a budget!

I love this place.  It's an inconspicuous little spot I found about 2 months ago while craving a burrito.  I gave it a shot and have been hooked ever since.  Egg, Potato & Cheese Burrito is everything!  It's even good WITHOUT the salsa choices that are available to add to your burrito.  Yes!

I'm sad to say that Super Burrito "fell off".  I've ordered twice here in the past few months and the food has not been good.  The burrito (Potato, Egg & Cheese) I'd been ordering for years was extremely greasy and undercooked.  Another time I ordered take out with my friend and the enchiladas were dry, lacked seasoning and the cheese wasn't even melted.  I felt so bad, I cooked up something for her at home.  I'm not sure if there is a new chef, but I am terribly disappointed in the recent changes.

I had a really good experience the other night at Pep Boys.  I stopped in to get new wipers for my car, since I noticed they had gone dull.  The gentlemen working there were just that.  One went out and checked my wipers, confirmed my suspicions, another chose new wipers for me, the other put them on and disposed of the old ones for me -  all in less than 10 minutes!  All I had to do was stand there and look pretty, lol.  AND they're open until 8pm on a weekday, unlike so many other things in Scottsdale that close early.  I can't vouch for major repairs, but I've never been waited on "hand and foot" at a Pep Boys store before!lol

Nothing but excellent customer service every time I come here.  A few months ago, an amazing young lady helped me with figuring out how to place a curtain rod over a set of blinds (a neat and professional way). There's actually a product online that has a piece you can attach to the headrail, but it wouldn't fit the type of headrail I have. With some ingenuity and her advice on what nuts to use, I figured out a sturdy way to add curtain rod brackets to the preexisting blind brackets without having to remove the blinds. Thank You!

{Actual Date of Visit: 12/14/2011}  I ordered the Hot & Spicy Bean Curd.  It was ok...  I'm still annoyed by the fact that decently priced combo specials in AZ are few and far between.  When I asked to substitute the white rice for fried rice, they told me I would have to make a side-order.  What is up with that out here?  Can't you just charge me extra? I KNOW for a fact that you have a big VAT of fried rice sitting in the back...Don't front like you make it fresh per order.  Anyway, I decided on the rice bowl size.  The meal was fine, just uneventful and a really small portion for almost $7.  Next...

The few items I've had on the menu are consistently good. The food is always fresh and finally a Chinese place in Phx that puts broccoli with your food! I don't have many issues with the bartender bc I usually order for pickup on the way home. He's always friendly to me and calls me by name. I could see how his personality could be off putting to some tho, so I suggest some of you who've had less then desirable experiences with him take your food to go. I think the food is worth it.  The other staff members are very pleasant and I always see customers having a good time when I go.  On an earlier visit, they messed up my order (chicken instead of tofu), but fixed it promptly. No problems since.

This place is so cool.  Great food, great energy, great servers!  Wonderful place to unwind after a week full of exams!  Long wait on a Friday night though.  We started off  with the Garlic Cheese Beer Bread - love, so good!  Our meals included the Garden Burger,  Four Peaks Cheeseburger  & Mushroom Swiss Burger.  They were ALL tasty!  I had never had hard cider before and really enjoyed it!  Cant wait to go back!

{Dates of Actual Visit: 3/9/12 & 3/14/12}  Good food, good service.  I'm a little late on my review as Blue Nile is now closed, but I came here twice before it closed down.  I'm a little disappointed that they are converting this to a middle eastern spot, but I guess it is redundant to have Ethiopian restaurants in such close proximity.  I learned that the owner has opened up a new restaurant Tsom, but I feel like each Ethi place offered something special.  The Veggie Combo and the Curry Chicken were good.  The Veggie Sambusas were tasty and the Vegan Coffee Cake was AMAZING!  How do they get it SO creamy?!  I would also like to thank the owner for his hospitality as my friend had to do a project on teff (the grain that injera is made from) and he allowed us to see how the Injera was made.  Thank you!

I can honestly say that I'm not the biggest ice cream fan.  I mean I like ice scream, but I can be a bit sometime-y with it.  But when I crave it, I crave it in a big way.  Cold Stone can be a bit much for me with all the toppings, but that's what makes it SO cool..  That being said, the servers at this location are the nicest around.  I've visited the two cold stone locations in Tempe many times because my friends LOVE ice cream.  Most times I don't order anything or I'll take a sample spoon of something and the servers are ALWAYS very sweet!  My favorite thing to order is a like it Sweet Cream with Snickers.  SO GOOD!  Also cool to know that this is the first location EVER OPENED in 1988!  How cool is that?

Our server James was incredible: cute, patient, attentive and funny.  I'm STILL thinking about that Passionfruit Lemonade...*smacking my lips*.  The Chipotle Bean Burger and Chicken Pita (forgot which one my friend got, but she didn't leave a crumb!) was yummy.  The potatoes had good seasoning but were a tad overdone.  Dessert was DELICIOUS!  That Turtle Cheesecake is superb!  They lost 1 point for the rude employee by the payout area who seemed annoyed when we asked for dressing and ketchup AND for that cleaning lady who started sweeping around us while we were eating.  I absolutely HATE that!

I have now been to Lalibela twice.  My first experience was tastier, but the food here is solid.  I took a 1st timer to ethiopian food (also gluten-free) and she really enjoyed her meal.  The lunch special sampler is a great deal and of course I love all the vegetarian options.  My favorite is the Tikil Gomen which I double up on!

Consistent Ethiopian food.  Always fresh and tasty.  For some reason Ethiopian food tends to be polarizing - either you love it or hate it.  But, I've taken several friends here and they all have loved it!  They have recently branched out by having their food sold at Whole Foods in Tempe. Nice to see food from the continent reach the masses.  I wish them continued success!

I had no idea that there was a Green Restaurant so close to me!  I must say that I prefer the location in Phoenix as far as decor even tho this is the original.  I took my meat eating friend and he loved his special.  As usual the food was great, but I decided to try something different this time and got a Chai Tiramisu Tsoynami.  Note: As I was warned by the server, it tastes nothing like Tiramisu (which is my favorite dessert), but I got it anyway.  It was interesting....it had crushed animal crackers and a taste of ginger.  It was fine but I wouldn't get it again.

If your business says you are open until 9:30pm, then you should be taking customers.  If not, lock your doors.  We arrived at 9:15pm and asked if food was being served as we could sense a hesitation in the greeting.  She went to "check".  Afterwards, another woman came out (the head honcho) and told us, "We can serve you, but you'd have to be out by 10:30 (with a straight face and looked us in the eye).  My friend looked at me to see what I was thinking.  I was already on my way out the door.    That was highly disrespectful.  There is a way to talk to people.  Just say your kitchen is closed.  I don't tolerate ANY level of disrespect from ANY establishment.  So maybe your business is doing THAT well that you feel you don't need new customers.  (I don't think any business is is in that position, especially nowadays).  I don't care what you're serving up in there, no thanks.  There are way too many places to eat...pause.

Probably the worst airport I've ever been to.  Super inconvenient.  If you need to go to another terminal, you have to walk a mile and a day to actually get to the shuttle to go to the other terminal.  Whoever designed this airport needs to go back to the drawing board.  Oh and the wi-fi is not the best either.  Depending on where you are in the airport, you barely get a signal *sigh*!  Strangely enough in the "city of sin", a lot of the eateries in the airport close at 7pm and 8pm on weekdays!  However if you like to gamble, there a plenty of slot machines in there to suit your vice!

I'm not a big mall person, but I can appreciate a nice one.  Fashion Square is very clean, and has nice architectural details.  I love the fact that although this mall has many high end shops, the sales associates are not pretentious.  When I first moved to Scottsdale, my brother and I went shopping here a few times and always had a good experience.  Parking is a little crazy, but I always manage to manifest a great parking spot. :)

Sigh....I was excited to come here after I saw the reviews including my yelp friends glowing reviews.  Unfortunately my experience was not the same.  We arrived and were promptly seated.    Strike 1#: The seating was filled with crumbs and wasn't cleaned off after the previous group of patrons.  No big deal, we brushed the crumbs off.  Strike #2: I really wanted a latte so I asked our waiter.  We don't have that, just plain coffee.  I was disappointed so I decided not to get anything else.  But he kept asking do you want the coffee after I already explained I didn't want plain coffee.  Why not suggest something else?  Strike #3: I asked to redeem the check in deal: He answered of course no problem!  After several minutes he returned and informed us that it could only be redeemed on the weekdays.  "Would you still like it?"  Uh...no my friends and I answered.  Strike 4#: We order our meals and my friend received her order of sweet potato fries.  After several more minutes of waiting the waiter returned to say, "I'm sorry we can't make the fritatta because the oven isn't working.  I just shook my head.  I proceded to order something else.    My friend sensing my growing frustration said "I have no problem not tipping." I responded to her that "not tipping" reflects more on the customer more than it does on the waitstaff.  She then suggested I speak to the manager.  I decided to take her advice and seek out a manager bc the whole experience just didn't sit well with me.  It turns out the first person I approached up front was the manager.  As soon as I asked if I could speak to the manager, his whole demeanor changed.  I said, " I'm a little concerned about the service I've received here today." After I explained my disappointment in the series of missteps, he simply responded, " I'm sorry the seating was dirty.... we're a busy restaurant and we run out of things."  I suspect the waiter had already "briefed him" as he became very defensive answering "I mean we have coffee".  No smile, no words of reassurance - nothing.  Wow.  I said, "ok" and walked back to the table.  When I returned to the table, I made my decision to leave.  I went back up to the manager to cancel my order and he said ok quicker than I could even get the words out of my mouth.  Then he proceded to come over to the table to ask if my friends wanted to cancel their orders also.  WOW.  I answered, "would you like them to?  I specifically stated that I would like to cancel MY order."  At this point I was elated that I had made the decision to leave.  It was obvious that he didn't want our business.  How obnoxious!  I regretted being kind enough to want to quickly cancel the order so as not to waste food!  (My friends were hungry and I would never expect them to leave just because I didn't like the service.  They acknowledged the service was bad, but were just so hungry they decided to stay.  I on the other hand am perfectly aware that I have MANY choices when it comes to dining so I opted to leave.)    My issue with the service overall was not that I couldn't get what I wanted.  It was the CURT RESPONSES given.  I have a history in the service industry in promotions and event planning along with several years in patient care in the healthcare arena (and am now currently a medical student).  I don't think it is unreasonable to get competent friendly waitstaff in a restaurant.  My waiter was very unhelpful and I suspect he was new as he was unfamiliar with details on the menu (and procedure).  It was just a very frustrating experience.  And the manager just made the whole experience worse.   There are plenty of places to dine in the Phoenix area, my favorites being in Scottsdale.  The service has always been very good and substitutions are suggested to ensure a great experience.  That's all I expect.

Uh...the reviews were so on point about this place.  I love the decor.  A bit old school with that exclusive country club feel.  The music was nostalgic: reminded me of growing up listening to my mom's favorite station Lite FM in NY (a mix of 70s and 80s lite pop).  Everything was delicious, can't wait to go back.  The omelettes and French toast are indeed wonderful...wow.

I've only been here for takeout a few times, but the staff is really friendly.  I've been looking for a place that makes good dosas and was so happy to find Udupi.  So happy they cater to vegetarians.  The Thiruneiveli Spinach Dosai is amazing!  I can't wait to try some other things!

The shoe dept.  Go there.....or maybe don't go there so I can keep all the cute shoes to myself!  Great customer service and I love that this Macy's is easily accesible from the outdoors so I don't have to go thru the mall like I have to at Fashion Square.  In and out!

Had such a good time here.  Our waiter Josh was cute and so much fun!  He can make a strong drink!!! The Gibbilini Bellini had me buzzed!!  We had the O'Riva Pizza (no olives) and the Chocolate Chip Pizza Cookie (yay).  The pizza was a lot bigger than I expected and was really good.  We will definitely be back!

The Big O Vedge is the best vegetarian sandwich I have ever had.  Like... for real.  It is extremely flavorful.  And...with their friendly servers, this location is my solidified favorite! :)

I learned of Lush several years ago when I received their products as a gift.  Soon thereafter,  I checked out the first store they opened up in Manhattan, but I must admit I never shopped there often because it was so damn pricey!    As I entered the doorway, I was greeted by an eagle named Phoenix as Lush celebrated their "charity pot" project to protect endangered animal species.   I entered further and was greeted right away by a sales associate who explained the event and demonstrated the cocoa butter laden lotion on my hand - yum.  I was then led over to another associate who helped me with the "caca" henna hair bars.  I know a lot about henna and I must say Kristen did a great job in explaining its use.  In addition to the henna, I picked up some heavenly cocoa butter bath bombs before being offered some vegan cake and TJ's sparkling lemonade! The cake was made by a winner of cupcake wars! More yum! The girls in here are so sweet and do a great job at being bubbly as well as charming you into buying product.  If you feel better when you leave a store happier than when you came in, then the employees are doing a great job...

This Fry's location is beautiful.  I can't believe how much effort was put into the decor...very impressive.  It is clean and streamlined.  Even though, I don't eat meat, my friend and I picked up some apricot rotisserie chicken and fried chicken for a gathering and it was a hit!  They also have a nice selection of desserts.

I REALLY wanted to love this place...but it did not go well.  I never noticed this restaurant although it is right next door to my favorite burrito spot (Super Burrito).  When I arrived they were plenty of people pulling into the drive thru.  Since I couldn't figure out what to order, I went inside.  The staff was cordial.  I decided to keep it simple and ordered a traditional burrito.  I was so excited!  I got home and bit into it and "crunch"!  I tried again..more crunch!  Broken egg shells in my burrito!   Needless to say I lost my appetite.  I called to let them know I was bringing the burrito back and no I didn't want anything else (they offered).  Although they were very apologetic, I'm just not sure I can bring myself back to trying something else.  D'lish was a D'isappointment :(  Maybe I'll give the new Tempe location a try *sigh*.

I've been coming here for several months thanks to the suggestion of you fellow yelpers! All I get is the breakfast burrito w no meat (potato, egg &cheese), so I can't speak to their other menu items.  The breakfast burrito is delicious. Rarely can I go a week without having one. It has the right amount of salt and spices and the tortilla is fresh and slightly flaky.  Prompt, friendly service.

Oh Yes! Had some yummy yummy samples of wine and wonderful service from our server!  The food went perfectly with the wine pairings because the dishes weren't overdone.  This way the wine remained "the standout".  The ambience is very "grown & sexy".  REPEAT!

I came to this location in Tempe after visiting the Picazzo's in Sedona.  I ordered the Puttanesca Pizza (no olives) with Garlic Butter Crust again because it really is THAT good!! I think the crust was even better this go 'round!  The Chocolate Chip Skillet with Coconut Vanilla Ice Cream is great and big enough to share!  We enjoyed sitting outside on the beautiful outdoor patio on such a beautiful day!

My mom and friend had such a great experience here buying my graduation flowers and corsage that they asked me to write a review. They went in last minute and the woman was so accommodating with their last minute request. My flowers were gorgeous and still looked great days later.

This is the 2nd time I've been to this CVS.  The staff is always pleasant.  This time I went in for passport photos.  I was in and out in less than 5 minutes.  Although I'm not always crazy about CVS' prices as a whole, I found a $2 off coupon online for the photos.  I'll be sure to check online for coupons more often.

In general, I find shipping things as a whole WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, but getting good service softens the blow!  I received really great service at this UPS from Taylor! He took his time to figure out the best shipping options for me to mail some items back home! Thanks!

I came with a group of five including 5 year old twins  We ordered a variety of things including egg rolls, spring rolls, vegetable pad thai, masala curry, pumpkin curry, and chow mein.  The pad thai was the worst I have ever had.  It was mushy and had a weird tomato base flavor.  How do you mess up pad thai?! I actually sent it back to order the chow mein to keep things simple. The waitresses on staff that evening seemed inexperienced.  I really did not like the food. The best thing we had was the masala curry.  Oh the kids loved the mocktails!  My cousins frequent this establishment often and they were also disappointed with the service. Maybe it was an "off" day, but I will not be back

I remember going to CPK years ago (in NY) and enjoying it.  But I must say I was really disappointed.  We ordered a Roasted Artichoke & Spinach Pizza, but it was just ok.  Maybe I'm just comparing it to Picazzo's AMAZING Puttanesca, but this was a fail.   It wasn't nasty, it just wasn't all that...  And we were starving so it should have been delicious.

Arrived just after happy hour (why is happy hour so early out here?)  I sat at the bar and ordered a white sangria, veggie slider and sweet potato fries.  Everything was really good and the presentation was elegant.  Nice modern feel to the spot (reminiscent of NY).  Kyle the bartender was great.  He brought me 3 different types of aioli to try with my fries.  Now that I know that the dining experience is good (had takeout last time), I'll come back more often.

As you can see from my check-ins, I have become a regular @ BOB.  They have greatly improved on their service (much appreciated)!  My friends and I have returned multiple times for their nachos and pizza! I also have ventured out and tried their Tree Huggin' Veg Head and Spinach Artichoke Calzone - all good.  Make sure you catch Happy Hour during the week to take advantage of their drink and appetizer specials! They have Wi-Fi and the music they play is also really good! SOLID! :)

Had a great time with friends tonight celebrating a fellow Capricorn's bday. I love Dave & Busters because I get to play!  YAY!  The Nascar Race Cars were SO much fun to play with friends!  Didn't eat dinner, (I had already eaten) but my friends said they enjoyed their food.  I had a Long Island Peach Tea at the table and the Copacabana Colada during game time.  Both were good, but they definitely are light with the alcohol in their drinks which is where they lost one star.  I rarely have two drinks in one night!  Wonderful, helpful staff!  Can't wait to come back to play some more and to experience the rooftop patio.

We went to Lucille's on 6/16/12 for a friend's birthday.  It has a great lively atmosphere.  My friend's uncle was playing live blues for the night!   We had a very large group so I am also posting the review for my meat eating friends also because there weren't many veggie options available besides sides.  My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was "ok".  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.  I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many "OKs" across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits.

Upscale version of YCs.  Better seasonings and sauces available (Yay for Curry!).  As a vegetarian it is harder to pack all the veggies in your TINY bowl here as compared to YCs though. The drink specials are AWESOME!

Wow, just had a really great experience here with Azher in the Personal Care department!  She was so helpful!  She spent a good amount of time with me talking about the products (I absolutely adore body products).  I actually found a new cleanser and sunscreen due to her advice!    I usually avoid Whole Foods because I find it to be too pricey, but I needed to pick up a tea that I knew I would find here.  When I walked in, the first thing I saw was yummy goat milk soaps in dozens of flavors.  If you don't know, goat milk soap is as nourishing as it gets!  I was able to compare this Whole Foods to the one in Tempe and am happy to report that this one is SO much better. There is NO comparison.  There were so many goodies here and the sample of chocolate mousse with blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and blackberry won me over!  People are so NICE around these parts!!!!!

Went to Vegas and couldn't leave without some falafel :)  I went to Amena because it got such amazing reviews! The woman at the front was incredibly hospitable!  We came on a Sunday night and practically had the place to ourselves -YAY!  I took a first-time-falafel-taster here.  I was very proud of him because he was very open to trying a vegetarian favorite of mine.  He ate 5 out of 8 falafel balls and killed the hummus, so it was a success!  The pita was so fresh!  We both adored the mint lemonade.  It was amazing and thank you so much for the refills!

I love that the food was freshly made and the place had a great "down home" feel.  The owners are also very welcoming, made us feel like family.  We ordered the Bean Enchiladas, Chicken Enchiladas & Chicken Gorditas.  All came with Rice & Beans.  We all enjoyed our meals.  Good prices also.

I am so happy I went to check out SWINA finally!  I was way overdue for a facial and my skin is still trying to get adjusted to this dry weather out here!  I had such a good experience with Corina, my esthetician.  What a sweetheart!.  She was knowledgeable and personable with a gentle touch.  I loved that I was offered a hand AND foot massage during my facial.  The product recommendations were on point and there were no pushy sales tactics.  My skin felt hydrated, moisturized and clean when I left.  Looking forward to my next facial :)

I like that this target is never busy whenever I go.  It is well lit, very clean and has helpful employees that are actually visible in the departments unlike Walmart.  Having said this, I don't go to Target often because their prices are usually higher than Walmart.  However in recent years, they have been lowering their prices.  Their selection of bodycare products is a standout.  I even found the recycled exfoliating gloves that completes my showering experience.  And also the borax I use for laundry and cleaning that I just couldn't seem to find anywhere.  Check out the cute accessories on clearance.

Ok, you know you love a place when you've been there twice in one week.  The first time I went I got the Fresh Island Green Salad and Fried Imperial Rolls.  The second time: the Curry Apple Tofu and the Fried Imperial Rolls.  (As you can tell I adore the rolls!)  What I love about this place is that they give a generous amount of food AND it's good!  A lot of veggie places go a little too far with the "portion control" lol!  The presentation is thoughtful and creative.  The man who takes your order is friendly and playful too.  This place definitely is an instant fave :)

Wow...I hate having to write a bad review.  It is so draining.  I should have known it would be a bad experience when I asked the older women who served us our food, if there was rice coming with the meal and she snapped "It's coming, I'm only one person!"  Then when she did drop off the rice, she slammed it on my keys causing it to almost tip over, "Here's your rice."  Wow....  I understand they were understaffed (and she wasn't a regular server), but if I didn't have a Groupon I would have left immediately.  I know when I'm not wanted.  That old lady is just nasty...God help her.  She rolled her eyes at us so many times that night as she would pass by, I'm surprised they didn't fall out of her head!  Apparently this was a busy day for Latitude Eight, but that doesn't excuse the extremely slow service, our numerous bill mix-ups, and the 1 Groupon per table rule.  You would think that they could've made a compromise for the fact that we were in the restaurant from 6 - 9pm (watching other patrons effortlessly flow in and out) waiting patiently for each course to come, plates to be cleared out and bills corrected.  I will admit that the fine print on the Groupons were an oversight on our part, but our waitress/owner? wouldn't budge.  She even went into detail about how she was losing money on Groupons.  That is not our issue.  The point of Groupon is to attract new clientele, in lieu of making of profit.  If you offered a deal at a fee that was too low, then that is a matter of your own financial management.  Don't take it out on customers with attitude and rigidity (especially if the service isn't good).  Finally after 7 minutes or so back and forth, another gentlemen agreed to let us use 2 of the 4 Groupons to apply to our bills.  We weren't pleased, but at least it was something.  It's been quite some time since I received service this bad.  I left the restaurant disgusted.  I had to convince my friend that it wasn't a "skin color" issue especially with that mean old lady!  I have dined in all type of restaurants all over the world (5 star at that) and have received excellent service,  so I'm not quick to pull that card.  And there is plenty of diversity in Chandler.  I hope it was worth it to treat us like crap.  There are plenty of Thai restaurants all around Phoenix including my favorite: Thai Spices.  As I wrote on the check, "God bless you!  I hope you find peace in your establishment."

Yes you can find a great deal on clothes & shoes.  But what makes me love TJ Maxx the most, is actually their food section. They have lots of gourmet treats including chocolates, baking mixes, oils, spices and even greens powders. My next favorite thing is their beauty section with body washes, hair styling aids, nail polish & makeup. If you see something you like, grab it bc it prob won't be there the next day. That's what happened to me!

Ugh...I had never been to a Waffle House, but my southern friends who frequent them a lot back home convinced me to try it out for a late night creep.  The food is just sub par and sits hard in your belly.  All I ordered was waffles and I wasn't impressed.  I do appreciate that they are open late, so I wont' "throw the baby out with the bathwater".  The cocoa was cool and the server was cute, sweet and attentive.  Fortunately for me, my taste buds are already spoiled with The Good Egg.  I'm so sorry I cheated on you baby!

Another rival to my "Good Egg"! The service is great, the food is yummy.  I'm stuck on my "Half & Half": 2 Protein Pancakes, 1 Egg scrambled your way and your choice of a 1/2 order of Idaho Hot Skillet.  There is realy no reason to get anything else...

I'm a Trader Joe's junkie.  I get most of my food from here.  I love the atmosphere, selection, samples and of course the friendly employees.  The only thing I don't like is the seasonal availability.  You fall in love with something then you gotta wait a year to see it again!  Back home I had 2 stores closeby to choose from and watched as they opened up two in Manhattan (finally!).  So of course I move here and one of my requirements was to live near one (or more)!  This location feels smaller than the one in Tempe, but much more streamlined.  Both are a bit out of the way for me,  but this one makes more sense since I do most of my shopping in Scottsdale.  There are less people shopping here (yay) and I feel like I can get in and out quicker.   The employees are always right there when you need them.  Bonus: It's right next door to The Vitamin Shoppe, so I can kill two birds with one stone (is that pc? ah well)! Next stop: the TJ's in Paradise Valley to compare.

Customer service is not the best at Best Buy in general.   They never have enough people available on the floor to assist you, but this had to be the worst customer service I've EVER experienced in a Best Buy.    When I entered, no one greeted me hello and I actually saw the employee look over at me.  (Mind you it's 7:30 on a thursday night - I swear I heard tumbleweed, that's how dead the store was.  So it wasn't like they were swamped.) Then I had to search for someone to assist me.  I found two guys talking in a corner.  As I approached them, they continued their conversation for a while instead of immediately addressing me.  Then they didn't say hello, they just stopped talking and looked at me.  (Oh I'm sorry for disrupting you both, I just assumed you were both working and were able to provide me with some assistance.)  I said hello and asked for what I was looking for.  They acted like my request was unheard of (an external mic for a mac).   One finally responded.  He looked around with me for a bit, mumbling that they didn't have anything.  Realizing he was inept, he referred me to another employee who actually was helpful (sorry I forgot your name- that extra star is for you!)  I wound up not getting the product there because I saw it cheaper online while at the store.

Our visit took place on a Monday afternoon. At first we were concerned bc our waitress came off a bit aloof and disinterested. I requested a sample of the tempeh bc my prior experiences with it were not good.  At that point, the manager showed up with the sample and she was super nice.  Afterwards, our waitress warmed up when she saw I was interested in ordering the cinnamon roll pancake lol. She actually wound up being extremely helpful. She made sure we didn't order too much food and saved us some money!  She confirmed my interest in the cinnamon roll pancake which was probably one of the best things I have EVER eaten! On the healthier end,  I was feeling rundown so the protein bowl was a great fit for this vegetarian: egg whites, tempeh, avocado,  basmati rice, queso fresco & kale. The orange juice was freshly squeezed with the perfect amount of sweetness. Overall a good experience. You lost a star and a half for cleaning (sweeping, shaking out things and spraying the window) while we were eating. Yuck, I really dislike that!

I really like this location much better than the one I previously visited in Mesa on Iron Ave. This location is well lit w natural lighting streaming in and it seems as if the food even tastes better. We enjoyed our meal and our waitress was very attentive. I plan to visit this location in the near future!

{Date of Visit: 9/7/12}  Typical Olive Garden fare, but an amazing staff.  We were in the area after visiting the Wildlife World Zoo and Aquarium.  We were starving and this was close by.  The best customer service I have EVER received at an Olive Garden.  Shout out to Eric for the wonderful drink suggestion and great personality!  And kudos to you all for working so well together and giving our new waitress a helping hand!

Quite possibly the nicest medical staff I have ever encountered.  Cheryl is the perfect greeter/hostess/receptionist.  She is pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient.  Everyone knows how challenging it is to pick a new dentist.  Speaking to her and you Yelpers :)  is how  I decided to choose Gentle Care Dental for my dental provider for my TDA Dental Plan.  My experience was phenomenal.  Flexible appointment times and no long wait once in the office.  I was given the option to complete my paperwork prior to my appointment so that saved time.  To begin, Raquel brought me into the examination room to review my x-rays and discuss any issues of concern.  After that I met with Dr. Barela who advised me on my teeth and confirmed that my crown that had come unattached (damn sticky candy) was in good shape and could be re-cemented.  Thank God, because I was scared at having to fork over a hefty chunk of change for a new one.  After that, I had my cleaning by the hygienist, Brenda.  She was indeed very "gentle" with my teeth and gums.  I thought it was cool that as part of my first appointment, they take measurements of your gums as a baseline and store that digitally.  In this way, they can more accurately access any gum deterioration.  Once Brenda was done,  Dr. Barela re-cemented my crown and spent a great deal of time with me discussing after-care and answering general questions I had about my teeth and dentistry.    Initially, I was looking for a holistic dentist, but my insurance didn't have coverage for any in the area.  It was nice to hear Dr. Barela's views on fluoride (pros/cons) and that he was open to my stance on daily care that doesn't necessarily involve fluoride.  He is open minded and I appreciate that.  I personally use Dr. Collins Restore fluoride-free toothpaste.  It was nice to know that Dr. Barela was familiar with it, its main ingredient Novamin (Calcium Sodium Phosphosilicate) and research studies involving its efficacy.  Nice!  I really look forward to going back in 6 months and I recommend that you try them out too. :)

I have had two experiences here.  They both were great.  I love that this store is in a little nook, so it is never crowded.  It is also very clean and bright.  They go above and beyond to help their customers.  Shout out to Nicole B. who spent a generous amount of time with me last week making sure I had everything transferred back onto my replacement phone.  She embodies the meaning of customer service: knowledgeable, patient, persistent and pleasant!

I went to Blue Martini last night and had such a great time.  Sundays is R&B/Soul night.  The live band Reminisce was AMAZING!  They took me back home to NYC with the live band lounge experience!  It was a good diverse crowd and everyone was enjoying the music!  I ordered the margherita flatbread, a caramel martini and the apple tart for dessert.  Everything was tasty.  They make the drinks kind of strong and appreciate the fact that they leave the shaker at the table with plenty more to consume!  The lounge itself is really sexy and I imagined coming here for a date night or perfect for hosting an intimate party.  I don't know about the other nights, but If you love live soul music, definitely come out on a Sunday night.

I've had a few shoes fixed here.  One had a peeled off sole that was glued back on.  The other two had to get new soles affixed.  Boris, the son is a really nice guy.  Fast turnover for repairs!!!  A little pricier than my spot back home but fair and they do good quality work!!!  Thanks yelpers for the recommendation! :)

Wow, really big supercenter!   I like this shopping center because they have many needed stores all in one area.  It made my "errand running" A LOT easier.  This Walmart has many things here that I can't find at my usual Walmart on Pima.  Only downside: it took me forever to find everything!

This is a huge upgrade from my experience at the Chandler location!  The people working here are so friendly and helpful.  They make sure you leave satisfied and no ridiculously long wait times (This is why I love all things Scottsdale).  I had a continuing issue with my laptop and was fed up.  Needless to say, they fixed the problem permanently!  Shoutout to Justin (my Q-boro homie), Adam the manager and Otthman(sorry for the spelling).  You guys are the bestest! :D

I purchased a Living Social Deal for 3 Works Washes several months back.  The wash itself is good and the workers do a great job.  My issue is that every time I went there they pushed some sort of service on me.  The first and second time it was a "limited time offer" for a detail.  The last time it was for my windshield that "desperately needed to be replaced".  This place is like that annoying dude on the street that keeps trying to "holla" and you keep trying to escape!  "Can I have your number? Can I have it?"  Ugh!  No thanks!  I'm not interested in all that and honestly that's what stopped me from going back.

Now let me preface this by saying I don't "do" laundromats.  I've been spoiled in that most of my life I've had a washer and dryer at my disposal.  (Being little and going with mom doesn't count!)  So sometimes when I get in there, it takes a minute for me to get acclimated.  But I'll go every once in a while for my comforters.  I went on a Saturday night (yes a Saturday night) so it wasn't busy at all.  The employee working there was pleasant and very helpful.  She helped me pick out the right size machine for my comforter (I didn't want to squish it in my machine at home - you can't get a good wash that way, plus you can ruin the machine!)  While I waited, I surfed the web using the free wifi.  My comforter came out pretty clean and the dryers dry fast like a NYC laundromat dryer, tee-hee.  I'll probably go back to wash my sleeping bag.

This place is pretty cool.  One stop shopping for all my ethnic goodies: Caribbean, Latin, Indian AND Middle Eastern!  The spices are so cheap!  They sell all types of cookware and cooking tools.  I nearly jumped up and down when I saw the isle full of Goya products, kola champagne and Indian body products.  Ahhh, felt like home!!! If they sold henna for hair here, it would be perfect!

I arrived EXHAUSTED after a long day at school, just looking for a place to chillax for a while.  I wasn't too crazy about my last experience at the Tottie's on Thomas Road, but I wanted to check this location out.  They got me when I saw "Try our Vegan ice cream" on their specials sign outside the doors!  Oh and I like that they have to-go menus outside, so you can figure out if you actually want to go inside.  Still in my med school scrubs (I appreciated that there was no "side eye" from the establishment for that - but hey I'm gonna be saving lives in a few years lol!), I decided to give it a go!  Whew! this place is gorgeous!  It was happy hour, so I figured let me sit at the bar.  Kenta was the perfect-gentleman-bartender.  He kept the talking to a minimum (I'm not into all that chitter-chatter from bartenders), was very professional and as a bonus: very easy on the eyes lol.  I also had the pleasure of meeting Tottie the owner.  What a sweetheart!  I enjoyed her down to earth welcoming nature!  She still even cooks!  I like that the drinks are listed in the drink menu from dry to sweeter.  SInce it was happy hour, the drinks were only $5!  I ordered an Orient Express (I don't really drink, but it was definitely one of those days).  Yummo!  It was a martini with thai coffee and creme something or other, lol.  I sipped on that until my meal arrived.  I ordered the Chiang Mai Noodles - Thai curry chicken, Thai basil and bamboo shoots with rice noodles (subbed veggies instead of chicken).  The rice noodles were thinner than I expected, but still tasty.  SO MUCH FOOD!  Kenta made sure to tell the kitchen to add extra broccoli -yay!  I have leftovers for 3 more meals (eating some as I type!)  Overall, I had a great experience.  I definitely felt better when I left compared to when I first walked in.

I came here for happy hour a few weeks ago.  I was exhausted and just wanted a place to chillax after a long day of school.  I like that they have menus outside, so that you can decide if you want to come in before "committing".  I was still in my medical scrubs, so I appreciated how there was "no funny business" about having to be shi-shi in such a gorgeous restaurant.  I truly enjoyed the decor.   I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Tottie who was so personable.  We chatted for a while.  The bartender was pleasant, accommodating and not bad on the eyes either :P  I ordered the Orient Express for only $5.  It was so good!  I love that the drink menu is categorized from dry to sweet.  For my meal, I ordered the Chiang Mai noodles without chicken.  It was good, but soupier than I expected.  It got thicker as it cooled down.  It had a nice flavor, but then again I love curry.  I did not expect it to be so much food!  I had leftovers for days!  Good food, gorgeous environment.  I definitely had a better experience here then at the location in South Scottsdale.  I could really see myself coming here for a birthday dinner.

By golly, I've found it!  After going to 4 Thai restaurants since I've moved to the Phoenix area (only 3 months ago), I've finally found my go-to spot!!! This place is close to school, clean, great food, great service and a great lunch special.  Also I'm a sucker for presentation and they go all out!  I had a great experience and they got me in and out on my short lunch break! YES!! :D

Omg! Jacob is amazing. He gave me some great advice on an old piercing that has given some irritation over the years. I was trying to get it repierced; instead he gave me something practical to try.  He is very professional and quite knowledgeable about the way the body works! I will be back to get my jewelry from here.

I called ahead to see what time they closed and found out the drive-thru stays open until 9pm which was a bonus.  When I arrived I ordered the Hummus Veggie Wrap and a smoothie.  The hummus wrap was unexpectedly spicy, nice surprise!  Since I couldn't decide on a smoothie, I decided to "make my own".  I mixed strawberry lemonade with peach & pineapple.  So good!  I loved the sandwich: chock full 'o veggies and spicy!  I wish there was a location in Scottsdale!

Nice staff, but definitely wasn't all that...Don't get me wrong, it was quick; but definitely not the most painless.  It did seem to last longer than some other waxes I've received.  I do appreciate them getting me in on the same day, that was definitely a plus.  They give very affordable Brazilians especially if you are a first time customer (50% off with coupon).   But she missed a spot o_O.  That is a pet peeve of mine so they lost 1 whole star from a solid 3 with that.  I guess I'm just super spoiled with my Brazilian Waxes from Bliss.

I just came back from my 80 min reflexology massage at Mary's.  I found a great deal off of Living Social ($25 for a $60 treatment!).  After being pleasantly greeted by Mary and her daughter, I filled out some paperwork.  My masseuse Jason took me into the room to begin.  After a 10 min foot soak and shoulder massage, I was led to the table for the rest of the treatment.  What was so cool about this treatment, was that it was a reflexology-massage combo.  Some reflexology places just do your hands and/or feet.    I never got rubbed, kneaded, patted, and rolled like that in my life! lol.  I don't think he missed a spot!  Ummm...I never realized how much I like my feet touched (TMI).  So 80 min or so later, when he was done, he was like "ok, finished!"  So what.. like now I have to go???  Like how do you do all that and just leave a girl hanging? I felt like I got kicked out of bed!  I did NOT want to leave.  Oh no, I can't be that girl!  I felt like I was in a drunken stupor.  It was amazingly delicious.  Jason has hands from God.   Anyway, I reluctantly got up and was led out of the room, where Mary had the "I told you so" look on her face.  She handed me a bottle of water (whew!) while we had a nice little chat about naturopathic medicine, chinese medicine and reflexology.  If I could, I would come here every week!  (Looking out for another Groupon/Living Social deal in my email inbox...)

Wow, the food was really really good.  I ordered the brunch special: breakfast quesadilla with tofu chorizo and pumpkin latte.  The food was seasoned so well.  Everyone in my group enjoyed their food.  Busy busy place, but worth the wait.  I will definitely be back!

Came here for takeout.  I was feent out (yes, I said feent out) for some Caribbean food (other than my own).  And the Caribbean restaurants are few and far between out here.  On top of that, I'm a veggie.  So I was excited when I learned of a spot that touts healthy Caribbean food.  As a Caribbean girl, I wanted to love this place, but... CONS: Curry Tofu was not as firm as I like, spicy but lacking seasoning to balance it out, only 3 slivers of plantain. PROS: Large serving sizes, clean, homey, friendly hosts, late hours, Caribbean map drawn on the wall :)  I will definitely give them another shot, as I know many people don't know how to cook tofu properly.  Since they are Guyanese, I'll give the vegetable roti a try next time.

Will definitely be coming back more often.  I've been looking for a cheap spot to wash my car since I moved here.  The coolest part is they let you use the vacuums after the wash for free!  All for $5!

OMG! Just one visit and I love this place already!  I love the down home authentic feel of the place.  So happy to find an "Olive Garden alternative".  We came for lunch and had a wonderful meal:  Eggplant Hoagie, Express Chicken Picatta & Badaboom Chicken.  The meal came with a basic salad and bread (no charge for extra bread & salad).  And the best part is the prices are so reasonable!  A great place to get lunch!

Yup it's confirmed... Rigatony's is definitely a 5!  We had the sweetest waitress Nancy.  This time we went for the Chicken Florentine, Eggplant Parmigiana & the Carb Smart Chicken Linguine.  Everything was delicious!  Just found out they have a punch card so I will definitely be making some use of that!

Thank you Tanda M. for reminding me to review this.  I went to the casino two weeks ago.  It was cool, but not as exciting as most casinos I've been to.  Usually the atmosphere is enough to make me want to stay awhile...

I can't believe how much fun I had here!  This was our second haunt of the night for a friend's birthday.  I love scary things so I led the way in my group and must say I got scared a few times!  I loved the costumes, the rooms, the special effects!  Some of the rooms get really hot so prepare yourself for that!  We went late (11:30p) so there wasn't much of a line.  Well worth the $25, wonderful job on this!  :-D

I love the decor of this place.  It is bright, airy and colorful...a warm welcoming environment.  And the decor matched the staff.  What wonderful customer service!  I was greeted very warmly.  I couldn't decide on a salad due to one of the ingredients it had that I typically don't like.  A second server went to get me a sample of said veggie and it turned out to be really good and fresh tasting!  My bartender explained to me that their produce is shipped fresh locally everyday.  I ordered the Farmer's Market Salad and the Kale-Aid.  The Salad was a little unexpected as the veggies are served tender, but it was tasty.  The Kale Aid was SO good!!!  I'm definitely coming back to dine in and luxuriate!

I've been to many movies here.  Friendly staff with yummy popcorn including my friend's fave: kettle corn!  You have got to try the Ultraluxe & D-Box theatres.  I love being able to sit in a movie theatre and have my food delivered to me!  Nice touch!  That's what makes this movie theatre special!

I had NO idea that a place called The Arrogant Butcher would feed me one of the best meals I've had in my life on 11/18/11.  I was giving my friend the side-eye when he suggested it.  Cuz I already know meat eaters look at us vegetarians crazy when we go someplace OBVIOUSLY meat-affiliated then want to complain, "There's nothing here for me to eat!"  But he insisted, so I went with it.  Umm...the Sweet Potato Tortelli is the BUSINESS!   Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts?  Who'd a thunk it?  Wow!  The combination of flavors and texture play...I could eat this all day...like for real-for real.   For dessert, we had yummy "hot chocolate" cake.  I left belly-full and grinning.  Just a few blocks from Stand Up Live, this was a great way to end a night of comedy!  The bonus:  they validate parking.

Came here last week for my classmate's birthday party.  We had a pretty large group, but they managed to get all of our food out in a reasonable time and even those he arrived later.  I ordered the mega veggie pizza.  I was really surprised at how good the pizza was!  A little pricey for their pizza sizes, so it was great that we could seamlessly use our Groupon deals!  Everyone enjoyed their food.  I would definitely eat here again.  Parking is horrible in this area, so it's great that they validate parking.

I purchased a Groupon for this establishment and I will admit as someone who is a colonic veteran, I don't think I will ever do that again.  I didn't like my first experience with another Groupon colonic purchase.  So when this went wrong, I knew it was time to cut my losses and fork over my pennies for a quality experience.  Now let me preface this by saying, I understand as a new business, problems can occur, "growing pains" so to speak, but how do you expect your business to expand with grave errors?  In addition, I never actually had the colonic procedure done.  Read below to see why.  Problem 1: Their phone system is out of the dark ages.  No one actually ever picks up the phone.  You have to leave a message and wait for them to call you back.  Now this can be days...So when I actually did get a call back, of course that was at 8am (when I was knocked out) so I had to play phone tag again.    Problem 2:  So after finally setting up my appointment for a week and a half from the date of the call, I was given NO instructions on how to prepare for the colonic.  Just "No food on the day of the colonic, but water is fine".  I have been getting colonics for YEARS.  Every time I am given information, even if they know I have had colonics in the past.  My friends who visited the establishment weeks before me asked ME how to prepare!  Problem 3: The day of I called to ask for directions because my GPS kept taking me to different addresses.  I thought the answering service and receptionist said 7th avenue instead of southern (weird huh?).  My error (I haven't even been living here a year yet), but a modern calling system or emergency number would be helpful in instances such as these.  I called twice with a half hour space in between.  Their answering service clearly states someone will get back to you within 30 minutes.  No one EVER called me back that day.  Problem 4:  They told me on the phone and in the message that they had recently moved so I decide to go to the old address to see if I can find out any other contact info.  The note on the door lists their new address which was right across the street.  Good job on that!  I get there and it's CLOSED.  Now mind you, by this time it's an hour after the time of my appointment.  I knocked on the door for several minutes, even on the door that has a sign on it.  I looked thru the windows: lights were off and boxes littered the floor.  Now in their defense, one could say, they could have interpreted my getting lost as a "no-show" , but this is when they could have called me like any other business when a client doesn't show up (keep i mind that there are two messages on record).  But I knew this meant they were never there to begin with!   So last night I received a call from the manager (4 days later).  She lets me know that their phone system crashed right around the time I was calling.  I won't judge the truthfulness in her statement, because honestly it doesn't matter.  She apologized and offered to extend the date of my Groupon since it had now expired.  She also stated that she would call those that were on staff that day to see why the doors would have been locked.   It could have been a family emergency (which I pray it wasn't).  Thanks but no thanks.  And thus this ends my pseudo-relationship with this business.  In my heart, I know I dodged a bullet.  If you are looking for convenience and professionalism, this is not the place.  I hope my friend Monet T. adds her review, so you can hear about her actual experience which she says was fine.  As for me, I'll pay my normal colonic prices because I value my body and my health.  It's worth more than a Groupon deal (which was refunded by the way).  Thanks Groupon!

I felt my carpets could use a good cleaning after the summer dust storms.  I had been keeping my eye out for some sort of deal.  I almost went with another local company who was offering a $29 deal, before I found Eco King on Amazon local.    Eco King's deal was $39 for carpet cleaning for 3 rooms.  I am very eco-friendly, so it is worth it to me to pay extra to avoid harmful chemicals.  But I must admit, I was curious if my carpets would actually be clean after these "natural enzymes" did their thing.  John the owner, was very flexible with my zany schedule.  When he arrived, he explained his process and how the pads on his machine worked.     Although the cleaning was not dramatic bc I keep a clean home ;),  I could immediately see that my carpets were indeed whiter!  But the biggest difference was the absence of the musty smell I had prior to the cleaning.  I was the most concerned about this, because I had a toilet leak a few weeks prior (yuck!).  SUCCESS!  It smelled fresh and clean when I walked in from outside!  John definitely did a better job than the carpet cleaning service I had previously used.   John is a straight shooter (an East coaster like myself) so he takes pride in his business.  This is apparent in his demeanor, but he is quite pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that he cares about using a process that reduces the amount of toxic load we all are exposed to.  He is truly a professional who believes in his business, his cleaning method and the quality of his work.

I visited Intimacy at the suggestion of my bestie who had gotten resized at the NYC location.  There aren't that many locations in the country, so I think that it's super cool that there is one right here in Scottsdale!    I am so glad I got resized.  Mary spent SO MUCH TIME with me helping me try on bras.  The method at Intimacy is 'holistic" in that they give you different bras to try on to establish a proper fit.  This is usually more accurate that the band-cup ratio.  I can't tell you how many times people used that system over my clothes and would put me at a cup or 2 cup sizes smaller than I am.  When I would show them the girls in all their glory,lol they would feel so silly!  Mary took one look and immediately knew what size I was!    As good as I am about wearing the right size bra, it turns out my band size was still too big.  I wore a 36 for most of my life until after college when I found out I was a 34.  Come to find out I am a 32 band!  Mind you my weight has not fluctuated much my entire life.  I thought 32 was for the teeny tiny girls but I feel the difference in support immediately.  The problem is they put everyone in a 36 because it seems like the standard but it's not!  So I ended up with a smaller band size and a bigger cup.  Intimacy's bras are PRICEY but of very good quality!  Sizing is free and you are NOT obligated to buy anything!   And if you see something you like but want to get it at a later date,  they can add it to your personalized wishlist.  Also I guess the return policy has been updated because I had no problem returning the bra that I saw cheaper online.  What's cool is they will price match a bra you find for cheaper price elsewhere!  Ladies most of you are wearing the WRONG SIZE BRA.  Who cares if you're a DD or a G or an A cup, it's no one's business but yours!!  Get sized properly so that your girls will be standing up at attention like they're supposed to!  *This has been a public service announcement sent around Yelpland to prevent double breast syndrome* :)

My friend and I stopped by on our way out of Phoenix Fashion week.  I ordered a calzone with lots of veggies.  Point off for not offering marinara sauce and the calzone was just ok.  I must say tho that the seasoned fries were tasty!  I just wasn't blown away by anything.  Be careful if you're dining in, it's smack dab in the middle of the casino, so the smoke will getcha!

I literally found Gemtime at the perfect moment. I was leaving Dunkin Donuts and just happened to look over and saw this little shop tucked away in the corner. The irony was that I had been carrying these two watches in the car for months that needed to be repaired. I had found a coupon for this place in the mall; but for some reason, I hadn't gone yet.   When I arrived in the shop, John had me pick out a band I liked and cut it to fit the watch. I actually like my watch better then before and wear it more often!  Had I not found Gemtime, I  would've had to ship the watch out to Kenneth Cole and go thru this long drawn out progress. Then, he held on to the other watch until he found the exact shade of red in patent leather to match.  Mind you, I searched for months online and went to several watch repair shops to find a match. He's really good and all of that work for a really great price.  Plus he's a really nice guy with a great rapport with his customers!  Thank you John for bringing my watches back to life!  :-)

I've been coming here for about a year now. It took me way too long to write a review! I found the center through Groupon and was hooked ever since. I enjoy the concept of community acupuncture as it makes it more affordable to get consistent treatments. Mayo is very personable. You can tell she cares about her clients. I've been getting acupuncture for many years now, but something abt Mayo's needling gets me into the parasympathetic state so quickly and deeply. I've recommended quite a few people here and will continue to do so!

My bestie had come into town and wanted to get her nails done.  When she offered to treat me also, how could I refuse?!  We had no idea where to go and found Pro Nails right here on Yelp.  The owner Julie was so personable!  They just opened the shop 5 months ago, so it's pretty new.  We arrived an hour before closing and they were very graciously accommodating.  I don't do manicures, so I opted for the deluxe spa pedicure.  About the same price as back home!  YUM! It was a wonderful treat!  My feet look brand new!  I love how CLEAN this place is!  The disposable tub liners really impressed my friends and I (we can be germaphobes).  Shayla did a good job on my feet and I will definitely be back!

{Actual Date of Visit: 12/9/2011}  Oh where do I begin?...I had a Living Social Deal for Limelight.  I was looking forward to coming here because the menu looked amazing.  We arrived on a Friday night around 8:15 pm.  Cute spot, modern decor.  It was surprising slow, but I was excited about my friends and I having more personalized attention!  I decided to order a Portobello Burger.  Guess what ladies and gentlemen? They ran out!  At first I thought the waitress was joking.  With a slight smirk on her face, she told me she wasn't.  Oooo, that didn't go over well with me at all.  A hungry NY vegetarian who can't get what she wants to eat on a Friday night.  Bad business.  (Sorry I'm spoiled in the restaurant department.)  My friends ordered while I tried to think of a new game plan.  One of my friends has food allergies, so when she began to ask about certain ingredients in the entrees.  Guess what again?  The waitress didn't know.  Huh? Do you really work here hon?   Noticing my frustration, my friend asked to speak to the manager to try to figure out some sort of accommodation for me; because besides the salads, there aren't many vegetarian options there.  The manager (Mike?) to his credit was extremely personable and figured out a way to make the Accurate Vegetarian Dipping Sticks into a falafel-like sandwich for me.  It wasn't what I was in the mood for,  but it actually came out pretty good!  Thank God for him, because that waitress would have earned him a 1 star review.    The friend with food allergies ordered the Caneohe Burger without the bun, it was a little burnt.  And my other friend loved her Pesterella Burger!  I don't eat meat, but It did look tasty.  All of us enjoyed the sweet potato fries.  The pineapple skinny cosmo was just ok and the first dessert, the chocolate chip cannoli was really not good at all.  It was pasty with a strange aftertaste.  I'm used to creamy goodness seeping out of a cannoli with a crisp shell.  So we decided to try again with the chocolate fudge filled cupcake.  It was fine.  I was so disappointed with my experience at Limelight because I really wanted to like the place, but there were way too many snafus. *sigh*

This is my second visit to Green.  The food is off the chain.  I love the decor!  Its framework is a garage.  This place is just as good as Red Bamboo (my fave vegan spot in NYC).  The first time I came to Green was in October.  I had the Spicy Buffalo Wings (they sure are spicy and SALTY!) and the Sweet and Sour bowl.  The bowl was very fresh, love the variety of veggies.  My friend had the Thai Peanut Bowl and loved it.  This time around I had the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich with the Thyme fries - amazing!  The Vimto is the TRUTH!  I seriously need to go back and try more things!

{Actual Date of Visit: 3/10/2012}  Oh! I took WAY too long to write a review for FuFu.  My experience here was probably the best sit down restaurant experience I've had in Phoenix!  My friend decided to get a Groupon to FuFu after I saw the good reviews on Yelp.  Caribbean AND African Cuisine?? SOLD!  I'm a Caribbean girl so I'm harder on Caribbean restaurants than any other type cuisine (You betta come correct!) and my experience in Phoenix with Caribbean restaurants has been sub-par!  My best friend is Nigerian,  so she checked out the place online and gave me the ok based on the pics, lol.  I loved learning about the owner's history: combining her African heritage with her experiences in Jamaica.  We arrived on a quiet Friday night.  I was worried about getting there so close to closing, but Esther (the owner) assured us it was ok to come.  Since I'm a vegetarian, I was concerned about what I would order when I arrived, but I decided to just go with it!  Esther suggested I get the Yassa with white rice and black eyed peas.  My friend got the Curry Chicken.  I was shocked at how good the Yassa was!  No tofu, nothing, just the Yassa sauce with the onions and peppers.  It was SO good.  I also ordered the Ginger Mint to drink and lots of plantains.  The plantains were so cheap- yay!  We ended the meal with the Brownie Cake & Ice Cream.  It was oh so good!  The African music videos they were playing were hot; we were dancing in our seats!  It was so cute how her hubby kept changing the videos once he saw how much we liked the music.  Esther explained that she was going to be having more social events to bring some "flava" to Phoenix (please do!) and invited us to an upcoming party.  Unfortunately it was around finals so we couldn't go.    I wish FuFu werent so far, but it really is worth the trip.  Great food, ambiance & service!  We plan on going back soon!!! :)

Thoroughly disappointed. My friend took me here as a belated bday brunch. The waitress got my order wrong, even though we had a lengthy discussion about it.  My food was lukewarm, as was my hot cocoa. They never brought us water.  Our waitress didn't ask us ONCE how everything was, but was quick to want to take away plates that we weren't even finished with. The worst part is it wasn't even busy! They didn't get ONE thing right, nor were they particularly friendly. I'll pass and stick with the Scottsdale location.

I brought my car here twice before, not sure why I haven't been back in so long! The prices are reasonable, the guys are super nice & do a great job! I love how they get into the conveyor area and make sure they get every spot scrubbed and dried. Much better than the washes at my previous spot. I'm officially a convert!  :-)

I didn't expect much for this spot being in the airport, but I was pleasantly surprised! I ordered the veggie burger with sweet potato fries.  The food was good and packaged nicely to go with all the fixins.  Furthermore, the portions are large and the employees are friendly.

We went a few weeks ago with a Groupon.  I ordered a Dosa that was about the size of my right arm!lol  That really surprised me!  Check plus for presentation!  It also came with a veggie soup.  BUT, I asked the waitress if I could have potatoes in the Dosa ALONG with the veggies.  She said yes, but when it came out it only had potato in it.  Womp, Womp.  My friends opted for the buffet.  Overall nothing was really amazing and it would have helped if the waitress would have informed us about the buffet being an option for the Groupon instead of us having to ask about it.  It would have saved us some time.

Great service, great food and nice spot.  I ordered the stuffed French toast with a side of eggs and kale and was surprised that a side of marinated tofu came with the meal.  That was the first time I ever saw tofu served as an alternative to say a sausage.  It was so good.  Wy-Knot 5 stars? You ran out of walnuts for the French toast!!!!  I love discovering new brunch spots and liked the owner Jackie down to earth nature.  Good job, I'll be back!

I went to the Street Eats Festival this past weekend with bestie and study buddy.  Luckily we arrived late and didn't have to pay an entrance or parking fee.  The lines were unnecessarily long and didn't move efficiently.  So happy I didn't purchase the 2 for $10 deal I saw on the Phoenix New Times Daily Deals prior to the event.  My friends got ice cream from Sweet Republic that they enjoyed.  The highlight of the day was the french fries from Superstition Farm! OMG!  They were delicious, especially with the Chipotle Aioli Sauce!

The best 99 cents store I've ever been to - in life.  Any 99 cents store that sells platanos (plantains) gets an A+ in my book.  Some of the things that they have here amaze me: organic produce, fine chocolates, electric tea lights, sea salt, sugar in the raw...I could go on and on. AND they stay open late! *thumbs up*

This place is the TRUTH!  I've been shopping @ Frederick's for years.  I visited the store in Arizona Mills a few months back, but it's a bit out of the way for me.  I just learned of this new outlet store yesterday (Black Friday).  This is their ONLY outlet store in the country, so consider yourselves lucky PHX-metro ladies!  They were offering lots of specials for Black Friday, but even their regular prices are clearance.  They have a "damaged" section that has items deeply discounted; some of which aren't even damaged!  Also, they have lots of bras for the over C- cup crowd and "uncommon" size girls (32-band) like myself.  I got a satin robe for $5 dollars, bras for $8 and some panties.  Nicky was a very helpful sales associate.  She helped me with the corsets of which I purchased 2!  I will definitely be back!

The only thing I ever get is the hot glazed donuts, so I can't speak to the quality of their other donuts.  Nor can I speak to the interior bc I only use the drive thru.  They always have hot donuts (the sign is always on), so you may have to wait a few minutes at times, what more do you need?

So this is the 3rd year of the Phoenix Caribbean carnival. This year the festivities were moved to the courtyard behind Seay's. The benefit to this was a good amount of shade, but the space was tiny. I went year 1, so I was hoping for a bit more by now. Honestly I was bored. I know we Caribbeans can't expect an Eastern Parkway (Brooklyn, NY) type parade or even that of Miami, but jeez it was dry! There was only one food vendor and the line was moving verrrrry slowly.  There should have at least been a "fast lane" for patties or festival (even though those weren't an option). The DJ was good enough, although he could add some kompa, zouk, punta, and latin to his playlist.  The Caribbean comprises of several countries.  I understand that Trinis run the show here in Phoenix (and put on a great carnival back home), but it might do the organizers some good to get some input from a variety of islanders out here.  Bottom line: more food, greater variety of food and snacks, local entertainment and some artisans selling Caribbean wares would be nice. Here's to hoping next year is more exciting!

I so appreciate this place! Very hard to find Caribbean/Latin (not Mexican) food in Phx that is reminiscent of those back home that are actually good!  The staff is really nice, orders are fulfilled quickly, and they stay open until 9p on weekdays!

(Wait =7 min) + (Inspection = 3 min) = 10 minutes total! I arrived at 6:45p on a Monday night. There were 2 cars getting worked on.  I've been at this location once before 2 years ago and I didn't have a long wait then either. The manager was super friendly after I'm sure was a long day. I will keep coming to this location.

Brand new location! Very clean and organized w friendly staff! In true 99 cent only fashion, they carry everything you could possibly be looking for in a dollar store. Picked up some butterfly shaped silicone ice cube trays!  :-)

I shadowed Dr. Myers for elective offsite hours during my last semester of naturopathic medical school. She is very personable, smart, and efficient with an excellent bedside manner.  That is a rare combination in a clinician.  I was particularly impressed by the way she was able to teach manipulation techniques and include relevant clinical "pearls" concurrently.    Observing her provided me with a great review of various facets of physical medicine (as well as anatomy) which are tested on naturopathic clinical boards.  I feel well prepared for that portion of the boards thanks to her.  In addition, she generously provided me with advice on how to ensure a successful career in the future.   Dr. Myers and her staff made me feel very welcome and respected which made coming there every week enjoyable.  I highly recommend shadowing Dr. Myers for anyone in the medical field.
