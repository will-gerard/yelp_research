I love Pruitt's!! I do like their East Valley location better than the one in Peoria though. At the East location, the salesman are friendly and you don't have to look far for one to help you, but they're not hovering over you like vultures. At the Peoria location they still have the same great prices, but once I picked out my dining room table, it seemed like the salesmen couldn't get me outta there fast enough when writing up my bill. But as for East Valley location...awesome furniture, prices, and people. I couch shopped for weeks and weeks going to Mor, Ashley, The Dump, Ikea, auctions, and rinky dink places and never found anything I really wanted, but I found it at Pruits in minutes.

Forget the gross fry bread at the fair. This place is amazing! I probably gain 5 lbs everytime I eat here, but it's totally worth it. The green chili shredded beef is awesome! Nice people, very clean, and somehow its inexpensive.

I booked her for my daughter's party, and she double-booked herself. Now I know the reason she asks YOU to call and confirm the day before your party. Then she made it seem as if I misunderstood her when our entire "booking" conversation was well documented by text messages. I don't think there is a way for me to misunderstand the words "my other client fell through, I'm available for your party". Luckily the lady she pawned me off on ended up being available and amazing. Look elsewhere.  UPDATE 5/28/12: I was going to leave my review as what it is - the truth. But now after receiving an email from this "business" owner asking me to change my review, and NOW accusing me of sending someone I don't even know to rate her badly, I had to update and confirm that I absolutely stand by my 1st review. The owner sent me an email a few months back asking me to give her a better review because her life was busy w/ work and school or something (I already deleted email). It was more of a "poor me" email, than an apology. I thought...you know what, I'm not even replying to this because I'm a mother, full-time student, and have a full-time day job and I make it work. No excuses. Plus, her follow-up comment makes it seem like she knew she was over-booked, but planned to send me to another face-painter...That couldn't have been the case because when I called to "confirm" her presence at my party, she had no clue who I even was!! I had to explain every little detail of when we talked and who I was before she gave me a # to another face-painter HOPING (not knowing) whether this other person would be booked or not. So don't act like you had it all planned out and under control.  After skimming through her other reviews this morning, I see that now she thinks that any bad review must be from me or one of my minions. Let me say I have absolutely no idea who the other 1-star commenter is. I am connected as a friend on Yelp with everyone I do know, and its sad that I have to defend that fact.  If you look at any of my other reviews, you will see I gave out 4 or 5 stars for every other company, and that is because they deserved it. Bottom line, a business is a business, you aren't the only person trying to make it through this hectic life in one piece, run your business well in the future, and stop harassing me about my honest reviews.

We love this place!! My daughter started taking Ballet/Jazz classes this year at 4 yrs old. I was nervous because this was her first time taking instruction from a teacher, but she is doing so well. I know that I have her teacher Ms. Marlo to thank for that. She is soooo good with children. All of the teachers I've seen have always had a smile on their face, and you can tell their students love them. Yes, some of the little ones are more "into" it than others and some are spinning in circles like one of the other reviewers mentioned, but my #1 priority was for my daughter to have a fun and stress-free time learning how to dance, and that she does! Other places I shopped around at seemed too serious and up-tight. And it is more affordable than a lot of places. Another plus is that fellow parents are very nice and nothing like the crazies on Dance Moms : )

Got my spray tan and I'm loving it! Looks natural. Jessica totally saved me from being a pasty, pregnant bridesmaid. Her office is really private and she's very sweet. Thanks Jessica!
