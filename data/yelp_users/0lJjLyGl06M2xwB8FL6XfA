So, this was my first time visiting McCormicks and I was really looking forward to it as I had heard so many great things about the food , service etc..   We arrived on a Wednesday evening and there were 6 of us. The restaurant was pretty packed but none the less our server was friendly and did his best (Steve) under the circumstances.        We ordered apps, salads, wine and entrees. I ordered the stuffed salmon and was expecting it to be amazing but it fell short. The outer parts were overcooked and the inside was raw! not to mention that the crab and brie filling wasn't even as tasty as it could've been. Everyone else seemed to love their food (filo wrapped halibut was a hit) so maybe I just got the bad food on an off day. I will say that the bar service and drinks were excellent.   Again our server was good but I am hesitant to visit this location again. Maybe I will try the Scottsdale location for better luck next time :)

Cibo has not only great food but wonderful ambiance inside and out- They serve clean and healthy food that is always tasty (mmm pizza)! It is located downtown in an old house that's been converted into the restaurant which gives it that old charm and private feel as you dine.    Stop by for lunch or dinner and sit on the patio for a lovely dining experience sure to please any palate. Great for date night too :)

SO this is my favorite local hangout, especially for Happy Hour M_F- they are good for many things... and before 9pm, its a family friendly place, in or outdoors!    Best happy hour in the East Valley by far and an amazing patio with live acoustic jams from 6-9pm. Then after 9, if you want to get a little crazy, they have an indoor DJ that spins house and a mix of 90's/80's.    I will say it can be a bit amateur after 10pm, but if you're hanging on the patio, its always a great time.     Make sure to order off of their 3.00 Munchie Menu for some cheap eats that are fabulous!!
