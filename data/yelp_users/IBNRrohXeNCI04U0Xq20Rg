These guys are awesome. They are super friendly and knowledgeable. It's kind of like if Cheers was a gun store instead of a bar. The more you get to know everyone the more you feel at home. I have never had a price problem, and they tend to have everything that other stores don't. Also, if you are a builder and a tinkerer this place is where you want to go, they actually have all of the little individual parts that you need when building or when you lost a part when building.

They are ok If you just need something delivered fast but don't want pizza. Other than that the food was not great and barely good.

I was happy I found this store. All the other Skateboard shops I found where way to expensive but this one had a larger variety and the two guys who worked there were really nice. All there shoes where also cheaper and they had styles I had not seen in a while.

I went to Fogo de Chao during their Meat Tornado event and, I was not prepared for the awesomeness. It was an amazing experience of meat, great waiters, and did I say meat? I made the mistake of going to the salad bar because I did not have enough room for all of the meats. I can't wait to go back to this place.

This store is so great. Unlike Best Buy their service is ultra fast and there is fun stuff to do in the store.

I have been here twice so far and still have not discovered everything that is in there. The interactive tour plus the room where you can play all the instruments are just a small part of the cool stuff there. The staff is really nice and knowledgeable about the instruments and history.   I finally went to the cafe that they have there and had a Butter Scotch rootbeer. I didn't even know that existed! The maker is called Dang! That's Good! and I agree.   Warning though, if you plan to go, go early because otherwise you won't see everything. It's pretty much a day trip.

After moving out her I hard a hard time trying to find a professional braider, and honestly it seems these people are the only ones here in AZ. The studio was kinda hard to find but the inside is really nice. The workers are very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice and friendly. The prices were also lower then anywhere else plus the quality was better.

The staff here is very nice and easy to talk to. Very understanding of students and situations to do with Financial Aid. Very nice community and surrounding area. Major discounts for ASU staff and students for the whole term of your lease. And 5 minutes from Tempe Market Place, 30 Minutes from the Air Port, and 10 minutes from ASU.

They are fast, they are nice, and they are low cost. I am about to use them for the 2nd time.

C2 has great staff, teachers, classes, prices, location, and inventory. My only issue is the range it costs a lot to shoot there unless you have a membership. And because of the way it's set-up there is not a lot of space and part of the lanes are short distance dedicated to  pistol only. Other than that, they are awesome and I highly recommend.

Slow delivery, that also never arrived. Not only did I not get a confirmation of delivery until an hour after I ordered. They then called ad asked if I lived somewhere I didn't (even though they have the address). After waiting so long and no hope for delivery, I just went out and got food.    I gave them two stars because grubhub was also a part of this stupidity.
