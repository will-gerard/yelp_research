I have two tattoos done by Evan Berry, one from 98 and one from 2001. An eastern and a western dragon on my shoulders. The work is amazing, I won't let anyone else put ink on me. These tattoos withstood the Iraq and Kuwait heat. I recommend Evan Berry and Crawling Squid for anyone.

I've been going to Butt Out  for a while now. I am happy to drive from Tatum & Bell to see these guys. I am always greeted warmly. The massive amount of 'juice' innovations behind the bar is staggering and may even be a little bit intimidating, until one of the employees asks a few questions and services up the perfect juice. Butt Out has good tech with in-house help. They have juice both from Indigo Vapor as well as 'house' juices, all of top quality. Free specialty coffee at the front and couches in the lounging area in the back next to the purified water. I have always enjoyed my get aways to Butt Out. I have referred a handful of friends and co-workers and all of them are very happy customers. Thank you Matt!

I walked in to the store and went straight to the juice bar where I was greeted by a pretty lady with a cute smile. I was trying a couple of the flavors out when someone asked me abut the itaste SVD mod and iclear30 I had on top and where to get replacement coils for it. I advised that I didn't see any there but I know that they can be found at a very affordable price at Butt Out in central Phoenix. The nice lady said that they did in fact carry them as well. I decided that I wanted a couple 18350 batteries and a few replacement coils. The pretty lady told me that I needed to go see "Bish" about the hardware. When I got "Bish's" attention I told him that I wanted 2 12ml bottles of juice, 2 18350 batteries and 5 replacement coils for the iclear30. This guy looked at me like I had just spouted out inflammatory comments about his mother. The look he gave me was utterly disrespectful. He proceeded to tell me how he runs a juice bar and doesn't deal in hardware and why would he have something like that. Then gave me another messed up look and turned around and walked away. I assume he was getting the juices that I asked for. Another patron standing behind me asked me if that really just happened, if this store owner had just treated me that way. The patron having confirmed that I wasn't just seeing things, I decided to just leave before I lost control per the disrespectful display. I will not be going back, none of my friends will be going here, none of my colleagues will be going here and I will make sure that everyone that asks my opinion hears my story. I guess that being a washed up nobody of a radio personality wasn't bad enough but now he thinks he gets to be a tool in person too. This store is a subsidiary of Pink Spot Vapors. I guess this is the kind of people they want working for them. For me? No thank you. I'll Pass and I think you should too.

I was going to Mill and heard about Butt Out opening a new store so I decided to check it out. An open space to lounge and nice artwork all about the shop, I found the place to be very inviting. I sat down and talked with the staff for a while about juice, mods, rebuilding, coils, etc. They seemed to know what they were talking about and were very friendly and ready to offer suggestions and help on the spot.   They have a massive selection of juice. While I was assured that it was okay to try all of them in one sitting I just cant imagine having enough time. I liked everything I tasted between their house juices and Indigo that they carry.  I felt at home. I didnt' feel like I was intruding or taking up space. To me the place was very inviting. I really enjoyed my experience at Butt Out Mill and  I think that anyone with an open mind would enjoy their rendezvous as well. I very highly recommend this establishment.
