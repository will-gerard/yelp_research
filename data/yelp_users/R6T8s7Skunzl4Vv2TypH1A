WOW! This is the best firehouse subs I've been too!!! Every staff member is super friendly!!! Also they kept checking in on me during my lunch to make sure I was okay and ask if I needed anything. Also Steve-O who works there is amazing! He gives the greatest customer service!!!

Everytime I go to this location I get the worst service. I walked in there last night around 7:30pm. I knew they closed at 8pm, but the guy was so frustrated that I came in to order my dinner. He was not welcoming and I almost told him to just forget it. He was making sandwiches for the employees and was annoyed I had to order two sandwiches for myself and interrupted him. I wanted one of my sandwiches toasted, he said he already turned off the toaster!!!!! Yes I get you are closing soon, but was pretty upset I couldn't get it toasted nor was he apologetic at all towards me. His attitude made me upset and had made me think twice about ever going back there. And this was not the first time I have had poor customer service!!!
