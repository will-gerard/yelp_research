Constantly making mistakes.  They filled my prescription with the wrong dose.  I didn't notice until I took it and felt funny.  I ended up in the ED with low blood pressure.  When j contacted them all they said was that they would give me the correct medication free.  When I wanted to file a formal written complaint I was told I would need to contact the corporate office.  This goes beyond that service but will be potential be fatal.

I have never had anything here that was not excellent. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is great. There is something for everyone and the food is not too spicy if you do not want it to be.

I drive 20 miles to come here.  I have had terrible vision my whole life, and I have seen many specialists.  They were able to get by vision from 20/800 to 20/50.  This is by far better than any other doctor has been able to correct my vision. Additionally I don't have vision insurance and they work with me and don't charge me for extra tests that are not necessary. I will come here as long as I live in Arizona.

Dr Cohen is a good doctor however you almost never get to see her.  Whenever I do get an appointment, she is consistently running at least an hour late.  The other nurse practitioners are novice providers at best, and will prescribe antibiotics for just about everything.  The office staff is rude.  To top it all off, they charge $25 to obtain MY OWN medical records.  Awful experience.  Also the office is located within a terrible neighborhood.

After posting this review I received a call from Dr Cohen's office every day until I blocked their number.  Craziness.

They are honest with fair prices.  My dog is scared of everyone, but somehow he trusts them to clip his nails.  My cat got an infection and the vet called personally to check on her.

This is my husband's absolute favorite place to get coffee.  It is also a great place to chill and/or get some work done.  I wish there were more.

I went here to get my gel manicure redone.  The lady used a NAIL FILE (not acetone or the small nail drill) to take off my gel.  She ended up filing down the entire nail on my thumb so that the under area was exposed.  It was painful and now I have to regrow my nail.

Most expensive fabric in the valley, minimal hours, rude staff, and located in an unsafe area.

Dr Saunders is great.  He listens and explains things well without being condescending.  Wait times on the phone are kind of long when trying to make an appointment, and that is why I'm giving  four stars instead of five.

Great food!  Friendly staff that is helpful.  With every dish you can choose the protein you want (chicken, beef, tofu, shrimp).  It has a relaxed friendly atmosphere and authentic feel.  Plus it is locally owned and operated.

They have a beautiful facility and knowledgeable staff that seem to truly enjoy their profession. I have never been to a dentist like this. I'm spoiled now.

They have pretty decent Thai food.  My favorite is the chow mien.  Additionally they are one of the few places around here that delivers quickly.  I also like being able to order online.

My nails look good, and the gel manicures are reasonably priced.  You must make an appointment.  I went in at 9 am on a Thursday and they were full.  I would have given five stars, but the technician was kind of rough.
