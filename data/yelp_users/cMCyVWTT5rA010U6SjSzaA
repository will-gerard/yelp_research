Terrible customer service. Reminded me of the "mean girls" from high school. I went there with my husband the other day (not for the first time) and even he noticed the employees' stuck up behavior. They were talking poorly of customers. I do not recommend this store. The Dobson location is way better. There is tolerable people there.

Very friendly salon. I stopped in real quick to get an eyebrow wax and the staff was attentive and genuine. The place is beautifully decorated. I will be returning for a facial.

Two thumbs up! I downloaded the yelp app in order to write this review. I have driven by the place hundreds of times but I finally stopped in today and it rocked! The staff was friendly and real. The food was Yummy with a capitol Y. I will definitely be returning for future lunches :)

Never again will I order pizza from Hungry Howies! They stole $70 from us and we didnt get any pizza!! The guy taking our order had no idea what he was doing. He talked so fast I couldn't understand him. He swiped both mine and my husbands cards and said they were both declined. Well our bank told us the money was there but HH was ran FIVE times. The manager said they didn't get paid so we didn't get dinner last night AND we are out $70 until the district manager resolves it with our bank. An hour of figuring things out on the phone last night and no pizza or refund. Its too band they are incompetent employees because I did loved the way their pizza tasted. Do not order Hungry Howies!

Culver's is a good quality fast food joint. The meals are better than most chains but they are not short of grease. The concrete mixers are what I go in for!

This is the best Mexican food I have ever had. Their chips and salsas are great! They serve three types at a time. Another big plus ia their service is FAST. After you order you blink and there is your food! My favorite place to eat :)

Mmmm. This is my favorite Asian cuisine! It is a small, independently owned business with a WONDERFUL menu, fairly priced, and friendly staff. They have the customer in mind :) I could eat here everyday. Good for happy hour drinks and appetizers

Yummy enchiladas. I like this restaurant. I prefer to take out though because the dining room doesnt have a comfortable ambience. Delicious, quick, Mexican food though.

So-so. It didn't stand out from other sub places. I wasn't impressed. I might return if there is absolutely no where else to go.
