Love this place! They offer a great twist on good local made hot dogs. Who needs a bun anyways? Try the the Igby, you can't go wrong.

The set up is sweet, but the service and food is lacking. I was served raw chicken with no silverware. Had to ask the server for water 3 times and still never received anything. Then to make matters worse, somehow they ended up charging me for an order of ribs that i never ordered. the server argued and pleaded with us until a friend wound up paying for it. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS DUMP!!!  Way to Mr. Fox.
