BEST LUNCH DEAL IN TOWN!!!!  In the past few weeks I have paid $10 for a regular sub at Jersey Mikes.  You pay almost $10 for a sub/chips/drink at Subway.  I had a sandwich, soup, and drink at Jason's Deli and it was almost $14 dollars.  Bamboo Club has delicious Asian fusion cuisine and their lunch special is absolutely the best deal that I can find.  For $9.95 you can get one of their lunch bundles which includes your choice of soup/salad, plus appetizer, plus entree.    I ordered the hot & sour soup, the pot stickers, and the orange chicken with fried rice.  If you think you've had orange chicken you haven't until you've had it here.  The food is excellent.  With an iced tea I paid under $13 not including tip for a really good lunch.  The place is clean, with great atmosphere, and a very good staff.  There is plenty of space with no wait.  If you work/live anywhere near Shea & 101 and you're not having lunch here regularly you need to start.    Downside is the dinner menu looks pretty pricey with dishes reaching the $30/ea range.    Enjoy.

This place served up one of the worst customer experiences I've ever seen a restaurant provide.  We went in and although the place had plenty of seating it took them almost 20 minutes to seat 8 people.  We told our waitress (who was really trying her hardest to keep up while her managers stood up at the bar and laughed) that we were in a hurry and put in our drink order.  After close to 15 minutes we finally got our drinks and ordered up 5 rolls.  Nothing special.  We finally got the first one almost 40 minutes after that.  Three of our party had to leave without eating.    The food was very average.  After that we asked for our check and again a long delay before we got our bill.  We asked to speak to the manager about this and he finally came over another 15 minutes later.  When we spoke to him about our experience he became extremely agitated and offered to pay for one of our rolls.  I told him thanks but no thanks and I would just pay the bill.  Then I informed him that this situation was obviously not our waitresses fault because the management was as bad as you'll find in this part of Scottsdale.    As we were leaving he told us that he never wanted us to come back again.    Absolutely AWFUL experience.

I joined this club for about 2 weeks and then switched back to my old club even though this one was about 2 miles from my house.  For the price there are nicer clubs.  The facility is old.  The cardio equipment is old.  There is no towel service.  There are no shower curtains on the shower stalls.  It is over-crowded with a lot of people who seem to be more interested in conversation than fitness.  The staff is isn't terrible but isn't friendly either.    Plenty of weight equipment and the locker area is large with plenty of decent sized lockers.    Overall this is a very average club in line with the old Ballys clubs.  Nothing special or unique.  For the money there are far better clubs with newer equipment, less crowding, more perks, and a lot less silicone and dynabol.

DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE....   My '99 Range Rover over-heated along Shea and I had it towed to Sun Devil Auto on Frank Lloyd Wright in Scottsdale on the recommendation of a friend.  It was clear to me the radiator had blown.  I called in and spoke to their service advisor and he told me they could get the new radiator and have it repaired that day.  I had it towed into them and as it was being placed on the truck I noticed that there was a lot of fluid underneath the truck and feared my engine may have been damaged.  I called back into the shop and spoke to the service advisor and he told me that it was nothing to worry about...it was probably from the hot water and steam washing the engine off.  Seemed reasonable to me.  I told him I did not want the repair if the engine was bad.  I did not hear from them until the repair was done and they told me it would be $776 for a radiator.  They told me over the phone that there was a little smoke coming from the tail pipe but the engine was "running strong" and it was not over-heating.  I went in and paid the outrageous charge and only then did they tell me that "there may be a possibility of needing a new engine down the road".  I drove my vehicle off the lot and I got less than 2 miles down the road when the truck over-heated again and this time the engine was making weird noises.  I pulled into another facility and they opened the hood.  The radiator lines were spraying water every where and 2 mechanics looked at it and told me that the head gaskets were likely blown and I'd need a new engine on this.   I ended up just buying a new car, however I only got $400 on my trade in.  Now I concede that the engine may have had problems prior to the repair but Sun Devil Auto SHOULD HAVE INFORMED ME OF THIS AND LET ME MAKE THE DECISION BEFORE SPENDING $776 ON A $400 CAR!!!  If the engine was not blown then it was their poor craftsmenship that caused the engine to over-heat again and blow the head gaskets.    I called up the Manager who was a very arrogant man and informed him of the situation and he told me that I signed an agreement that they were not responsible for any of this and then proceeded to tell me that they fully informed me of the problem and I had chosen to have the repair made.  My only recourse was to dispute the charge with Chase Bank and file complaints with the BBB and the Attorney Generals office.    DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE THERE.  Dishonest business and sales practices is what you'll get.

They finally wrote a letter in response to by BBB complaint that was littered with inaccuracy both in their account of the communication between us and in the way a professional repair facility is supposed to make repairs like this.    I have replied with documentation from witnesses at the scene to verify my communication to them and have supplied several websites and articles verifying that the procedure they informed the BBB was necessary is categorically false.    I am awaiting their reply.

I have received a letter from the BBB on this stating that Sun Devil Auto has refused to respond to their last letter containing the evidence I supplied regarding their fraudulent activity.    Know that when you take your vehicle to a Sun Devil Auto they WILL act unethically, rip you off, and ultimately ignore even the BBB.  Do you want to do business with a company that apparently doesn't care about its reputation let alone its customers?    Stay far far away.

Amazing pool area, complete with a sand beach pool area.  Great pool side service.  Food is excellent and the drinks are cold.  Staff is extremely friendly.  Rooms are very comfortable.  The only draw back is that it is a pricey place.  Expect to spend some money if you're going here.

Really liked this place.  The parking situation is a pain but the atmosphere, food, and pricing were great.  The live music was a bonus.  The appetizers were excellent.  The drink prices were reasonable.  Very friendly and helpful staff.
