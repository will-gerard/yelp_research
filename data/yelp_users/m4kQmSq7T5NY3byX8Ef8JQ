A stunning medium-size aviation museum.  I took a detour on the way from Durham to Ohio, and it was well worth it.  I spent an hour, but could have spent two.    The docents were great, and the facility is impressive.  It's a bit odd to get to- wander up the hill past the ANG base (with a couple of planes on display) and follow the signs.  You go through a security gate and there's not much signage, so be alert.  Once inside, there is a nice gift shop with many books, shirts, and trinkets.  Follow the signs for your tour.  First you'll see a replica Wright Flyer mounted at the altitude the original reached: only ten feet.  There are lovingly restored small planes and a Piedmont DC-3, and behind a wall is the biggest attraction: the "Miracle on the Hudson" A320.  The plane is remarkably intact, though damaged.  There is a raft used during the rescue, and many artifacts and stories about the event.  Check out the videos of survivors' stories, and the recovery and transport to the museum (almost as incredible as the event.)  Plenty of other interesting stuff here: F-4, F-14, Harrier, A-7, CH-46, and more.  Outside are a few more planes, sadly inaccessible behind fences.    The displays are well done, and well lit.  All the planes have interesting histories.  Well worth a visit, and a detour.

I've been here before and had more time to explore, and enjoyed it a lot.  This time we were in a rush, but the signage and people movers got us where we needed to be in time.  There are plenty of food and shopping options, the layout works well, and there was enough seating (though not many charging points at our gate- come on, people!)  I would definitely fly through here again.  USAir used to have a hub here, or rather America West; now both are part of American which is not my favorite, but this airport definitely is up there.

Madison is an amazing town for a foodie- just walking down State Street I found a huge variety of cuisines.  I had heard about this place from a friend, and Yelped it to see if there were any particular dishes to try since I've never had Nepali food.  In the end I just asked the waitress to describe the most traditional foods and took her advice.    The service was excellent.  It's a very small place, and it wasn't too busy when I got there, just before noon, but it filled up quickly.  It has a nice atmosphere.  I had the chicken sikar: stewed meat and vegetables, very good.  Tarkari as a side- a sort of vegetable stew, also good.  Roti flatbread, and daal (lentil soup?) also came with the meal.  I had chai to drink, which was very flavorful; have had it before, but this was better.  They were almost out of dessert but gave me half an order of lal mohan, a sweetened rice ball.   A bit out of my way, but I'll try to go back.

A great museum, in a town that seems full of them.    I went to the Wisconsin Historical Society as well, but it's more a research library than a museum.  Strangely, there doesn't seem to be any connection between the two places.  This one is comparable to the museum section of the Ohio Historical Center; the WHS seems like the archives and library portion of that institution.  When I went there was a special exhibit about toys, which was amusing but definitely more for kids.  There was also a small display of contemporary quilts.  The main floors hold the usual history and prehistory exhibits, well done with informative text and interesting artifacts.    There's a gift shop with a very good selection of books, local and general, as well as T-shirts and knickknacks.

A small, but excellent, museum, focused on Wisconsin's veterans but also giving an overview of U.S. military history.  Very nice exhibits, appropriate artifacts, a few planes and vehicles.  Just a really nice collection over all.  Oh, and free.  They appreciate donations, but weren't pushy about it.  That attitude makes me give even more, of course.

An outstanding place for lunch or brunch.  Friendly service (basically at the counter, though they bring your food out.)  Excellent bread, fresh ingredients, a cheery atmosphere that wasn't too cheery for a non-morning person...  I had a sandwich with salmon and avocado, I believe.  Quite good, as was the corn chowder, and the sweet potato latke we all shared.  Juice and lemonade were good, though not fresh-squeezed as I'd hoped.  We had a couple of pastries, too, and they were very good.

I've had plenty of Thai food, and was eager to try Laotian.  I was not disappointed.  I'm sure there's lots of crossover, so I can't say how authentic it is but it was darn good.  I had the mango curry with mock duck, which was incredible.  Full of flavor, just the right thickness to ooze over the rice.  I like spicy, and 2 stars just barely registered on my heat scale, but the flavors were so good I didn't care.  My friend had the curry squash, I believe, or some other veggie curry, which was good, not great.    The service was very good.  The prices were reasonable for the quality.  The place is cozy.  I hope to go back.

Didn't try the cupcakes, as I was told they were okay but kinda dry.  We did have a couple of other baked goods at our table: the fruit coffee cake muffin was good but, yes, a bit dry.  The cinnamon roll was really good.  There was a good assortment of cupcakes in the case, and a couple that appealed to me, but I wasn't in the mood for a lot of sweets (and the mound of frosting on top of each kinda put me off...)  The meal, on the other hand, was great.  Service was good; we had a big group, constantly growing, and they did a pretty good job of handling it. (We had called ahead to warn them.)  I had the huevos rancheros, recommended by friends and every bit as good as they said.  Tasty, good ingredients, accompanied by fresh fruit... Mm.  I also had a "bottomless" house-made lemonade, which was nice.    I'd certainly go back, and might someday try a cupcake.

The only thing saving this from one star is the sandwich I got.  It was their typical crunchy chicken sandwich, but it was actually pretty good- decent bun, good chicken, good veggies.  However... the rest of the experience was awful.  It was not fast food- they could not keep up with a small crowd.  There were three people in line ahead of me, and a half dozen waiting for their orders.  There is no seating since it's at the airport, and no really good place to stand- and since so many people were standing around, people approaching weren't sure where the line was.  Seriously, how does a McDonald's not know how to keep up, and how do they run out of so much on a Monday?  They kept running out of fries, and ours were barely cooked.  They were completely out of other items on their limited menu.  The girl who took my order was not friendly, and didn't know the menu, and screwed up my order.  I ordered a large fry with spicy mustard sauce for Sweetie, and a chicken sandwich combo for myself.  We did not get the large fry, but since they were out and I didn't want to wait longer I just gave Sweetie mine.  They are lucky she was not there with me, is all I have to say.  Every customer was grumbling; she would have told McDonald's exactly what they were doing wrong, and hurt some employees' feelings.  To be fair, it may have been more a management/efficiency issue, but no one seemed to know what they were doing.
