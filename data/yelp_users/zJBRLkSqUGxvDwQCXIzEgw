I love Kimpton Hotels so much that I wanted to spend my 35th birthday at a Kimpton!  Toward that end, I pulled up Kimpton's website and looked for a close-ish hotel perfect for celebrating.   With being just an hour plane ride away, Firesky was my pick for an Aries birthday celebration.  Here is a quick rundown of Firesky:  Staff - Super nice and accommodating, not fake nice either, everyone seemed genuine. :-)  Extra props to Jenni for the birthday sparkling wine, snacks and card!  Rooms - Comfy rooms, slightly dated in some ways (e.g. old marble floors) but I am ok with that because I respect the fact that Kimpton kept the original marble instead of just sending a natural stone to the landfill.  Location - Great location just a few blocks from the downtown Scottsdale restaurants and shops.  You could walk there or borrow one of Kimpton's bike, assuming its not blazing hot.   Pool - Make that pools, plural.  The pools and hot tubs were nice with plenty of options to be in the shade or sun.   The only catch is that there wasn't a hamper to place used towels so people would leave them on their chairs thus making you think the chair was taken.  Also, I think I saw a few crashers come off the street.  One of the pools has a sandy entrance and I saw a staff member come and bring a few kids sand toys which I thought was sweet.   Architecture/Decor - Hotel buildings themselves are a remodeled desert cool post-modern vibe.  The hotel lobby is just downright impressive with cathedral ceilings, an awesome fireplace and comfortable seating.  Here you can find coffee/tea in the morning, ice cold water in the afternoon and a hosted wine reception at night.   Parking - Lots of parking super close to the rooms.  If you're not a fan of stairs, be sure to get a ground level room since there is not an elevator.   Other Amenities - The restaurant on site was great (Taggia) and I loved the convenience of the gift shop for sodas, postcards and snacks.  Also, there is a bar if you are looking for a cocktail, glass a wine or mug of suds.  There were not any weddings for me to crash the weekend I was there so I can't speak to the banquet facilities. :-)  I didn't get to the spa either.  :-(

Service:  Sooo slow. Food:  Sooooooo amazingly delicious.  Yep, folks, so that is the punch line.  The service here was super slow but oh my, the food was sooo crazy good!  I was here earlier this month and I am still thinking about the delicious pasta dish I had here - more on that later.  Given the crazy good Italian food and friendly wait staff, I find myself overlooking the super slow service.   Bestie and I started with fried calamari.  The fried version isn't on the menu so you'll have to ask for it.  It was so lightly fried and perfectly cooked.  Note that the calamari listed on the menu is sauteed I think so if you want it fried, be sure to specify that.   From there we went for the date pizza "datteri pizze."  Dates, meh, not really my thing but when in the desert, eat dates.  Plus, I wanted to try something different.  Dates, goat cheese, bacon and rosemary makes one heck of a pizza.  This was really good and just when I thought it couldn't get any better . . .  Next came the chittara.  What is chittara you ask?  It is a square spaghetti like pasta that adorned with a rich and creamy smoked bacon, green peppercorns, egg-yolk parmesan sauce that will leave you in a state of pure bliss.  One bite and I closed my eyes and nearly slid off the booth under the table to some other world.  Yep, so good and I can't stop thinking about it.   Despite being love-struck with the chittara and stuffed from the carbs we closed our meal with a dessert (since it wsa my bday).  We had Taggia's version of a tiramisu which was tasty but not as special as our previous dishes.    Anyway, if I go back to Scottsdale I will definitely go back to Taggia for the chittara and probably get a few items to go too!

The delicious cuisine and wonderful service of Citizens Public House draws a diverse crowd - older couples in classic clothing, young adults in jeans and caps, match.com dates (yeah, I can spot them from a mile away) looking snazzy and friends gathering for a casual meal.  In other words, citizens has wide appeal for all ages and all occasions.   AJ was our waiter and was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. He recommended the chop salad (of course) and the scallops. My friend went surf and followed the scallop recommendation whereas I went turf and got the filet mignon. Both of our dishes were delicious.  The chopped salad was slightly unique and tasty but probably a little overrated at this point.   The downside to this popular restaurant is the noise level. I was here at 8pm on a Sunday night when the restaurant wasn't packed and it was s A little hard to hear my table met even though I have perfect hearing.

Ahhhh, the burger craze. New burger joints seem to be popping up on every corner and at some point the beef frenzy will subside and we'll be left with empty restaurants. However, I think Rehab has staying power that would even keep Linsey Lohan here!  The patty and condiment combinations aren't that unique but the ingredients are fresh and the sauces are good enough to eat with a spoon. In fact, I really think it is the sauces that make the burgers here. I ordered a classic cheddar cheese burger which I know sounds boring but it was a great choice as it highlighted the yumminess of the chipotle aioli sauce. As many other reviewers have said, the "sweet poTOTatos" (sweet potato tater tots) are good but for me, it was once again the sauce, this time the pineapple teriyaki that made the dish.  This rehab center has patio seating complete with a zillion umbrellas, fans and misters. But vampires need not worry, as there is a great interior too that is dim and cool. Also, despite being a super casual place, the bathrooms were neat and nice.

Bottom Line:  Really good craft brew coffee.  I passed Cartel Coffee Lab while on a short layover at PHX.  I noticed two things:  hip décor and a sign indicating that they serve some really good coffee.  Not needing another ounce of caffeine I decided to try Cartel Coffee Lab.  Although usually I just get a drip coffee I decided to get a mocha.  It had a very pure taste of coffee beans and cocoa beans.  It wasn't sweet which I liked.  It just tasted natural and genuine.   The upscale coffee definitely matched the cool vibe of the place including friendly employees and hip décor. After enjoying my highly caffeinated beverage I was ready to walk out on the tarmac and use my hands to push a Boeing 737 to the runway.  :-)

Beautiful vintage clothing accessories sourced from Israel and other European countries. The items here are unique and eye-catching and with that comes a fancy price tag. Service here is excellent. If you love genuine vintage items this is a must see while in Scottsdale.

The name "Hula" makes me think of greasy Hawaiian BBQ but I can promise you that you won't find any of that at this hopping Scottsdale eatery. My friend and I went for lunch and we were pleased that they had their own parking lot (albeit small) and we were surprised that the interior was classy (whereas we were expecting uber casual beachy). Service was prompt and friendly and it was only a matter of time before our lunches arrived - Caesar salad with shrimp rolls and a Polynesian chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  The Caesar dressing is amazing so I would recommend any of the Caesar salads here.  The Polynesian chicken sandwich was excellent but definitely a little messy so if you are at Hulas on a first date or lunch interview I would skip it.  :-).  For visitors from colder parts of the country, I can see where they would really enjoy the garage doors that roll up for access to the small outdoor patio and to welcome Sonoran breezes.  Not only is the food good here but the atmosphere is great too.  If you are fortunate enough to be there when the weather is ideal it's reminiscent of a San Diegan or Hawaiian ocean front burger stand.

Bottom Line:  Grumpy employees, slow service, greasy food and disgustingly dirty.  I was desperately hungry for lunch so decided to get a quesadilla at Lost Taquitos. In hindsight, I would have been just getting some snacks at the local magazine store.  I was able to order quickly but it took a long time for my food to come up which consistence of a steak quesadilla and some hot sauce.  Some vegetables with this would have been awesome.  I think it was supposed to come with pico de gallo.  Also, a smear of guac could have really livened this dish up.  Heck, some lettuce and tomatoes inside the quesadilla would have been good too.  There wasn't anywhere to sit which is probably ok since there are literally inches of dust hanging on the exposed sealing overhead.  I took my greasy quesadilla to go but not before heading past the adjacent restaurant to the soda machine which was Pepsi.  Bleh.
