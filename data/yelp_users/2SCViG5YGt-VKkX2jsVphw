We love this place.  Having lived in Chicago for over 30+ years, there were tons of places like this (old school bakeries, etc) in the midwest.  It's much more difficult to find in AZ.  From Jana's, we've purchased kolazckis, Polish sausage, paczkis, pierogies, sauerkraut, cookies....all were delicious.  The canolis are some of the best I've found anywhere.  It's obvious that the women who run this place are authentic - they're very friendly and helpful as well.  I could easily spend a fortune in here (and have on occasion!).  So glad we've found this place.  Beware - they tend to close up shop for a month in the summer.

This place is close to our house and we come here quite often in the summer when it's ridiculously hot outside.  We've never really had any problems and usually don't have to wait long for a lane, if at all.  We haven't experienced any problems with customer service - we've found that the bartender is particularly friendly.  The food is typical bowling alley food.  It's not bad, actually.  Sucks if you get stuck next to an unruly group of teens, but overall we enjoy going here.

Good food, good beer, good ambiance.   Unfortunately they won't be around much longer, so get there before Feb. 1.  Looks like the Glendale location will be the sole survivor...

We recently purchased a new home, and consequently, needed a lot of lamps.  We'd driven by this store many times without really paying much attention to it until now.  Upon going in, we realized that their prices are a bit higher.... if you're looking for just a lamp to get by, Home Depot or Target will probably do the job.  But for something that will last and is more of a quality, eye-catching addition to the room, Lamps Plus is the route to go.   Every time we've been in, the salespeople have been helpful and friendly.  One of the many (10+) lamps we bought was defective and couldn't be assembled.  I brought it back the next day (with the receipt) and had no problems exchanging it.  No problems to speak of on our end.

Recently moved to AZ from Chicago and found this place nearby.  Their attempt at Chicago hot dogs was pretty feeble at best... the dog was soggy (doubting that it was authentic Vienna Beef), they used the wrong pickles... the fries were hard and I couldn't finish them.  The pizza that the guys at the next table over were eating looked pretty sad.  And they're from Chicago and don't make Chicago deep dish pizza?  C'mon...  Dead silent in this place, one tv that was positioned so that nobody could see it, no soda fountain.... I had high hopes, but this place missed the mark.  For good Chicago hot dogs and better ambiance, I'll go to Taste of Chicago on Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird.

Very unique..... felt like I was in small town USA, considering the interior featured shiny pink booths, flashy 80s decor, and patrons wearing "Grandmas Gone Wild" sweatshirts.  I had the evening special:  baked ham with scalloped potatoes and applesauce - tasted just like a good ol' fashioned home cooked meal.  The shake I had for dessert was gigantic, and my wife enjoyed her pumpkin pie.  Anxious to try their breakfast after reading the other reviews now.  Wish I'd have known about this place sooner as I'll be moving out of the area soon...

Pushiest staff I've ever encountered.  My wife and I recently purchased a new home, and had LOTS of spaces to furnish.  We spent many weekends hitting up the furniture stores along Scottsdale Road, and before going in to Thomasville we looked at their online selection and were impressed.  So... we headed to the store.  We were used to the introductions upon entering furniture stores by the sales associates, followed by the occasional "how are you doing?" and "can I help you with anything"s.  But the salesman that greeted us here WOULDN'T LEAVE US ALONE.  He shadowed us as we walked throughout the entier store, commenting on EVERY SINGLE THING WE STOPPED TO LOOK AT.  My wife and I had ZERO opportunity to chat amongst ourselves during the entire 20-30 minutes we were in the store.  We consistently made eye contact with each other, trying to figure out how we were going to squirm away from this guy.  Finally, we escaped and needless to say, never went back or bought anything.  It's unfortunate, since their selection actually was good and we may have very well bought some major items from them.  Now, we just laugh every time we drive past the store and talk about the salesman in there that we'll never forget.

A year ago I'd have given them at least four stars.  The ambiance was great, cool decor, food was tasty and reasonable, service was friendly, and the beer selection was really good.  However, I've kinda given up on this place.  For the past YEAR, they've been saying that their kitchen would be open "soon."  For a good month, probably 6 weeks now, they've had a sign up outside that says their kitchen will be open "Really Soon."  Well... a year ain't "soon" folks.  Many times I drove up from old town Scottsdale to go enjoy a few beverages and a good meal there.  But as I said, I've given up on this place.  Not quite sure how they're staying afloat anymore.

We've liked everything we've tried here - the hot and sour soup is the best we've found anywhere.  We always wind up getting an order to take home.  Service has always been prompt, cocktail list and beer selection is good as well.  My wife and I are both partial to the seafood guoba as our favorite dish on the menu.  It's close and convenient, and a guaranteed good meal every visit.

Moved to AZ from Chicago about a year ago, and this is the closest I've found to a good Chicago hot dog.  They actually know how to make them, which is a step ahead of almost everyone else around here.  Their fries aren't bad either.  A bit pricey unless you catch one of their specials.  Good lunch place, plenty of tv's, friendly staff.  Nothing compared to authentic Chicago food, but again, the closest I've found out here so far.

Great spot to stop in for a weekday lunch, which I often do.  I'd say their food is a few steps above that of Zipps', their sister restaurant.  Their menu has many more options as well.  Good beer selection, friendly service, nice sports bar atmosphere.

Really like this place.  I usually stop in a couple times a month for lunch after I hit the gym next door.  It has a really home-y feel to it.  The service is friendly and always seems happy to have my business.  The bagel sandwiches are delicious, and the bagels especially taste fresh.  Great assortment, good menu, fair prices, good service - that's why I keep coming back!

One star is a gift.  This company manages our HOA in north Scottsdale, and they're horrible.  They are money-hungry suits that really don't care much about the community - except when the bushes get a bit too overgrown and they see the opportunity to collect a fine.  The community areas look like, well, garbage and they haven't done much about it.  Vacant properties abound, and they are left to sit in disrepair while they do nothing about them.  They love sending certified mail documents too.  Love our house, but I absolutely hate our HOA.

Fun place overall.  Looks like it's gonna be another western-style tourist trap, but it's actually a cool place.    Usually a decent selection of beers.  I've always enjoyed the food.  It's not cheap by any means - actually the prices are a bit steep.  Very basic menu - steaks, ribs, chicken, pork chops....not an ideal place for a vegetarian.  In my opinion, the steaks were some of the better ones I've had in town.  My wife always says hers is underdone, but mine have been great.  The appetizer portions are huge.  Meals come with bread & butter and beans.  Tried the ribs for the first time recently, and they were tasty.  I always save room for apple pie and ice cream for dessert.    Fun ambiance, good place to take out-of-town guests looking for a southwestern-y experience.  When it's nice outside, they'll have bands playing, people dancing, etc.  A fun night out.

We've gone on the Steamboat three or four times - it's a great go-to activity when we have out-of-town guests.  You can't beat the scenery, the food on the dinner cruises has been good, and we particularly enjoyed the two astronomy cruises we've taken.  Special shout out to Dr. Sky, who always delivers a great program.    Two strong suggestions:   1) It needs to state on the website that pets are not allowed on cruises with food.  We recently took a dinner cruise, and when ordering tickets, it stated that "well-behaved pets" are allowed.  We questioned whether or not our dog would be allowed on a cruise that served food and looked all over the website for something that stated he would not be.  Couldn't find anything and almost decided to take him.  Glad we didn't, as it stated above the ticket window that pets would not be allowed on food cruises.   2) The ticketing process is really flawed.  You would think you would be able to print your tickets online after you order.  Not the case.  Once you arrive for the cruise, you stand in a ridiculously long line to pick up your ticket.  This has delayed the cruise every time we've gone.  This is a seemingly easy fix, but nothing has been done.  Frustrating.  Otherwise, a top-notch experience.

Came in looking for envelopes for our wedding invitations.  They had a great selection of different papers, envelopes, and other fun items.  We found some envelopes that we liked, but we wanted to see if they had them in any different colors.  The salesperson told us to come back the following day to speak with Nancy about ordering some.  We did, and when we met Nancy she seemed irritated to have to meet with us.  She was dismissive, crass, and short with us... everything you would NOT want in a salesperson.  She said the envelopes did not come in a different color (though she didn't bother to check), suggested a smaller envelope, and when we told her our invites wouldn't fit in smaller envelope, she made it sound as if it were OUR fault (and told us, in a not-so-nice manner, to just trim our invitations down).  She absolutely did NOT go out of her way to help the customer. Needless to say, we had no interest in doing business with them after that and bought our envelopes elsewhere.  Nice store, nice selection, but they have one horrendous salesperson that knocked my rating down at least two stars.

When I moved in in 2010, I'd have probably given them a 4-star rating.  The location is great, the management (we called them the "Golden Girls") was friendly and knew me by name, and maintenance response times were quick and efficient.  Any issues I had were politely handled by the friendly, "motherly" ladies in the office.  They handed out bagged breakfasts on occasion in the mornings as you'd drive out of the complex, had popcorn popping in the office for residents, movie rentals available, and really went out of their way for the residents.  THAT version of the Cortesian gets at least a 4-star rating from me.  Then, Alliance took over in 2012.  The Cortesian went downhill FAST.  They canned all the office staff and replaced them with a bunch of young know-nothings.  Every time I went in there somebody new was working who had no idea who I was, etc.  Not very welcoming or home-y.  Random employees coming and going, no consistency.  Maintenance issue response times at least doubled.  I was used to getting things addressed by the old management within a day or so.... waiting a week became common.  The maitenance guy was nice - but there was only one, so they're WAY understaffed now.  Included utilities became a thing of the past.  While they renovated the laundry rooms, the new (and cheap) machines, along with the new credit card machine, are ALWAYS out of order.  Every weekend there were more machines NOT working than there were working.  Know how they clean the pools?  THEY DUMP BOTTLES OF CLOROX IN THEM.  I've seen them do it.  The fitness center was rehabbed but is consistently closed for who knows why.   I can't even count how many times I woke up to cold showers and the hot water not working.  A cold shower is always a great start to the day.  They re-painted the exterior of all the buildings, but told us less than a day beforehand to clear off our balconies, otherwise our items would be disposed.  Luckily I checked my junk mail to find that email, but I'm sure others found it too late.  Maitenance/rehab work has been going on forever with the swimming pools, and it starts at about 7 am (as does landscaping), so good luck trying to sleep in once in awhile.  The office staff also treated my wife extremely rudely when she tried to retrieve a fob for the laundry rooms, which I was none too pleased about.   Roaches, bugs.... I could go on and on.  It's amazing how the management and office staff ruined what was a nice place when I moved in.  I think the icing on the cake is their website, which depicts models and buildings not even associated with the Cortesian, and they call themselves a "renovated masterpiece" on it.  So add false advertising to the list.  Very glad to be out.

And now, upon moving out, they're hounding us for triple-digit  "move-out" costs despite us having a maid service clean the place from top to bottom upon moving out.  According to the lease they're supposed to advise the tenants of when the move out inspection will be so the tenant can be present, but they didn't with us.  When I called them out on it, they claimed we "gave up that right when we turned in our keys."  Both attorneys I spoke with said their claim and interpretation of the lease wouldn't hold up in court, and their assessed charges were illegitimate, but the cost to take them to court exceeded the amount they were charging so it wasn't really worth it.  CURRENT TENANTS:  DEMAND TO BE PRESENT AT YOUR MOVE-OUT WALK-THRU.    And their current property manager as of April 2013 is not pleasant to deal with.  She's more concerned with collecting money than working with tenants to solve problems... there are apartments north, south, east and west of this place...move into one of those, cause they can't get much worse than this place.

Was excited to try this place since I saw from their website that it had tons of sports memorobilia, and that the owner was from Chicago (where we are from).  And, it was within walking distance too.  Walked over there for dinner - it was, of course, ridiculously crowded.  Problem #1 - the hostess was completely clueless and overwhelmed.  We asked how long the wait would be, she said she was unsure.  We asked if we could put our name in, she again said she didn't know.  In the meantime, they're calling other parties names for seating, so we ask again.  The hostess gets a confused look on her face and ignores us.  So.... we just sat ourselves in the bar dining area.   Fifteen minutes later, a server decides to come over and ask us if we'd been helped.  She takes our drink order.  Two other servers come by and ask if we would like to order drinks, and we tell them we'd already had our drink order taken.  Throughout the course of our meal, I think four servers served us.  No clue who our actual server was.    I think this was in part because there was an ASU sports group (head coach?) in the restaurant sitting a few tables over.  It was amusing to watch the cheeseball of an owner spend the whole evening name-dropping and schmoozing with them.  Too bad it was at the expense of the other customers.    The food we ordered was actually good.  Kind of surprised that the burgers didn't come with fries, especially for over $10.  After we were done eating, it literally took almost a half hour for us to get our bill.  One of our four servers actually caught on and brought a bill and apologized for the sketchy service, but assumed we understood since the table behind us was "more important.  It is the new ASU head coach, you know."    We admired the memorobila collection as we walked out, listened to the owner do some more name-dropping about how he knew Bud Selig in the lobby, and left.  Despite the good food and impressive sports collection, we probably won't be back.  Too bad - was hoping for better.

No hesitations in recommending Dr. Staub.  I came to him with dire pain in my lower back, and with regular treatment I've been able to get it under control.  He's always been up front and honest regarding his course of treatment, and I've never felt as if I've been being "sold" something.  The bottom line is I feel much better and the pain is under control.  He's thorough in his assessments, personable with his patients, and very accessible as well.

Never a bad experience here.  Everything we've had has been good, including the service.  Good drink selection, tasty salads, flavorful pizza (and I'm usually not a thin-crust fan, coming from Chicago), and friendly service.  It's always seemed busy in there, which I guess is a good thing which shows that others think highly of them as well, but we've never had to wait long to be seated.  We'll be back again soon.

Took my wife here for her birthday - she'd been wanting to try it for awhile, and we'd never been - so I made a reservation and we went.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The ambiance was very nice, and our server was polite, attentive, and very helpful.  The house salad I started with tasted noticeably fresh and was generous in size.  My wife had a rotisserie chicken, which she really enjoyed.  I had their special for the evening, a lamb sirloin, and I was delicious.  Very flavorful, and the sides (broccoli and mashed potatoes) were tasty as well - and I'm not usually a fan of broccoli.  The evening was topped off by a birthday dessert of a banana/chocolate pie - again, delicious.  No complaints about the food, service, or ambiance.  Wish we would have found this place earlier, and we'll definitely be back.  It's risen to the top tier on our list of Scottsdale restaurants.  Highly recommended.

Our corgi has always had a positive experience here.  This place seems to be clean and safe, and the staff at the front counter is friendly and excited to see our dog.  Prices are reasonable, for the most part.  We typically buy a play session for each day as well.  Luckily we've never had to utilize the vet services, aside from a nail trim.  Our dog is very important to us, and we try not to board him if we don't have to.  But when we do, we feel comfortable leaving him here.

We've been here twice now, going back the second time hoping that it would be a better experience.  It wasn't, really.    The decor is very over-the-top.  Original, I guess, is one way to put it.  When we arrived, they were very busy.  Didn't seem like they were handling the many patrons who were waiting for a table all that well.  We were finally seated and ordered.  Service, overall, was spotty and a bit slow.  We ordered an appetizer, which never made it out.  We mentioned this when our meals were brought to us, and it was removed from our bill.  The meals themselves were pretty good - be prepared for tons and tons of rice (over half the plates of our main dishes were rice).  Wish there was more meat than rice, but the lamb loin that I had was pretty good.  My wife enjoyed her chicken (and heaping mounds of rice).    Probably the most unique item I had was the desert.  I have a sweet-tooth, and found their original Persian ice cream to be quite tasty.  It had a hint of rose petal infused with pistachio, and I really enjoyed it.  Though it's close by to us, I don't know if we'll be in a hurry to go back.

Paid my first visit to this venue, and as a degreed theatre professional having experienced theatre in cities across the country, Gammage leaves much to be desired.   This is in NO WAY a reflection of the performance we saw, which was pretty top-notch.  The venue is in bad need of a thorough renovation.  Dirty carpet, ugly salmon-colored paint, very limited bathroom space, ugly blinds all over, horrid lighting throughout the lobby (with all the money floating around AZ couldn't somebody spring for some chandeliers?).    If this is the best road-house AZ has to offer in terms of theatre...yikes.  My wife thought it looked and felt like a convention center.... to me it looked spaceship-y, or like one of those cookie-cutter baseball stadiums from the early 70's.  Maybe it was a "gem" back in the 60's, but it's time for a major renovation ASU.  There is potential here.

Man....the more I go here, the more I hate this venue.  The shows and performers are OUTSTANDING, but it is a true shame that this is the best venue that AZ has to showcase them in.  Phoenix is the 5th largest city in the US, and this is the best that they can do?  Embarrassing...  Aside from the pukey colored walls and a color scheme that was stolen from a 1980s couch, this pink spaceship seems more like a outdated convention center as opposed to a theatre.  It's truly an eyesore from the outside as well.  I love Frank Lloyd Wright and his architecture (having grown up in a midwestern town where his architecture was prevalent), but this definitely is NOT his best work.  Poor Frank would probably be disappointed in the dirty orange carpeting too.    How can they charge the ticket prices that they charge (which are fair, considering the high quality performances) and not provide adequate bathroom facilities?  The second act of the show starts, and for the first ten minutes of Act Two audience members are crawling over each other getting back to their seats because the bathroom lines were so dang long.  Come on Gammage!    Every time we see their lineup of shows, we're excited.... but we immediately think, "Do we really wanna deal with this horrid venue?"  Wish somebody would buy this place out, sink some money into it and make it the gem that it could be.

To preface my review... I'm a huge baseball fan that has visited a ton of parks, and grew up going to Wrigley Field in Chicago.  A bit spoiled to say the least.  I now find myself living in the desert and have adopted the Dbacks as my team (as long as they aren't playing the Cubs).    I like this park a lot.  Tickets are extremely reasonably priced.  I haven't had a seat with a bad view of the game.  I've sat in box seats, as well as the upper deck and everywhere in between.  It's clean, very family friendly (almost too much so!), lots of food and drink options, and on occasion we've had ushers come to our seats to take our food/drink order.  I've never had that anywhere else.  Scoreboard is very large but doesn't take away from the game.  The pool is kind of cheesy, but I guess it's a fun quirk that defines the park.    Parking is usually very plentiful and reasonably priced (we usually pay no more than $15 and on occasion have found street parking).    Four stars as opposed to five because: - when, on the rare occasion, the foodstands get busy they move VERY slowly and don't handle the crowds well. - this park is almost TOO commercialized.  The first time I went (when it was the "BOB" back in the early 2000s), the first thing I thought was that it felt like the game was being played inside of a shopping mall.  It still has that feel.   - some friends of ours that attend games with us have gotten food poisoning from the "All You Can Eat" food.   - the post-game neighborhood experience isn't much at all....but again, having lived in Wrigleyville for over 10 years, it's probably not a fair comparison.  Could be a plus or minus, I suppose.   Haven't ever attended a concert here, so I can't speak to that experience.  AZ in general doesn't handle crowds well, so I could see that being a mess.  As far as the overall baseball experience goes, it's pretty stellar.  Now if the Dbacks could only field a winning ballclub and put some butts in the seats....

Been here twice now, and both times have been a good experience.  Food was very good and presented nicely.  We especially liked the salmon appetizers.  My wife swears by the trout.  Good drink menu with tasty cocktails and a wide variety of wine options.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  Apple crostada for dessert was a great finish.  We'll be back!

Really liked this place.  The ambiance was terrific - especially unique for the Phoenix area.  A great change of pace from the repetitive strip mall eateries.  The pizza was great, which is more than I can say for a majority of the other pizza joints I've tried in the valley.  We had a vegan in our group, and they helped her craft a pizza that aligned with her diet preferences.   Food came out quickly, server was personable and helpful, and the prices were quite reasonable.  We'd return.

A classy, fun place to go for a nice change of pace.  I like cigars, and I enjoy a good drink (away from the douchebagg-y Old Town scene), and this place fits the bill well.  Great selection of cigars that are well-kept in a walk in humidor, great selection of beer as well as spirits.  I'm not a frequent whiskey drinker, so I can't speak to the fairness of those prices, but the smokes and beer are fairly priced in my opinion.  Friendly, helpful staff (in regards to both service and making a selection)....aside from the stench left on our clothes the next day, we enjoy this place thoroughly.

The best Mexican food we've found in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area since we moved here a few years ago.  Tried it initially based on a recommendation, and now El Encanto is where we take all of our out-of-town guests for a great meal paired with great ambiance.  My personal favorite is the pollo fundito.  Great flavor, great portion size.  I also really like the salsas that come out with the chips before the meal.  The first time I was there I wound up taking a container home.  We're always sure to get deep-fried ice-cream as a desert, too.    The pond in the center of the property is beautiful (except for the one instance we saw where a bunch of large geese all ganged up and attacked a small helpless duck...the wait staff did their best to save it).  Also, don't allow yourself to get seated in the back room of the restaurant.  No view of the pond, and a large loud clunky heater or a/c unit kills the ambiance.    We'll be back many more times I'm sure...

Came here for Valentine's Day with my wife - this was our second trip to this particular location.  Our service was great - the manager stopped over a few times to make sure everything was going well.  Very large wine menu, which my wife liked, beer options were a little skimpy (wish there were more local crafts to choose from).  We particularly liked the cheese spread for the bread and heard the couple behind us commenting on it as well.  The steaks, as always, were top-notch.  This is one steak you don't want/need to add any A1 sauce to, or anything else for that matter.  We both had NY strips...one of the best steaks I've had anywhere.  Cooked perfectly (as it should be, for the price).  As this is an a la carte ordering process, we ordered a side of asparagus, which was tasty as well.  The clam chowder I had before the meal was a hearty sized serving, and we finished off the meal with some carrot cake.  All in all, a great meal in a classy atmosphere.    Looks like they have a prime rib special on Sundays that we are anxious to try.

Once you actually manage to get inside, it's not a bad stadium.  Not outstanding, but not bad.    The absolute nightmare was the parking situation.  And it was a NIGHTMARE.  They have lots labeled every color of the rainbow (red, green, blue, etc) but how are we supposed to know who can park in them?  There are NO signs on the freeway for public parking - for those of us who aren't season ticket holders with a parking pass to one of these multi-colored lots.  It took us a good hour to find out where we could park...waiting in backed up traffic, driving around the mall being misguided by one attendant after another towards filled parking sections or sections that required a pass.  SO UNORGANIZED.  We called the stadium and they told us to go park in some high school and take a shuttle.  Seriously?  In the end, we settled for the Renaissance Hotel for (gulp) $20.  And then, after the parking nightmare ended and we walked for 20 minutes to the stadium, the wait to actually get into the stadium was just as bad.  I understand the need for security checks, but please staff them accordingly.  It was one gigantic glob of people, with zero sense of organization, trying to get through a handful of security checks.  That took at least another half hour.  No signage...nothing.    By the time we actually got to our seats after this nearly 90 minute debacle, we were in such a bad mood it was hard to enjoy the game we paid $80/ticket to watch.  Once again, Arizona proves that it cannot handle large crowds.    I think we'll watch the games on tv from now on.

Stopped in for lunch on a Monday afternoon - so I can't speak to a Friday or Saturday night experience - but my lunch experience was a positive one.  The bartender was friendly and chatty, and service was good.  I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, and it was very good.  Not too spicy, cooked well, and the sides were nice.  Obviously this place has a country, honky-tonk feel and I imagine it gets pretty kickin' on the weekends.  Prices were actually very reasonable, especially for Vegas, and most importantly the beer was cold (no Gilley's brand beer, though, and no Mickey sightings!).  Tons of souvenir items in their own souvenir shop too.

I've been here three times now, and have enjoyed every visit.  The portions are very generous, service has been friendly, and prices are reasonable.  With my gyros pita today (which was great), I added their homemade chips.  These were particularly tasty!  It's nice that this place is a bit "off-the-beaten-path," and not an absolute mob scene like the places down the street.  Quaint ambiance as well.  We will be back!

Got really sick after eating at this Taco Bell - up all night with an upset stomach after just two chicken soft tacos.  I generally like Taco Bell but won't be going back to this one (or any, any time soon).

This is a fantastic spring training facility. Clean, lots of food options (and usually any food trucks), updated, modern.... Night games are just as fun as the day games here, and we went to their Craft Beer night ($20 for five beers, not a bad deal at all!).  Parking is easy and only $5.  Always a great experience at this park.

Four goofy adults wanted to go out and do some go-karting, so we went on over to Crackerjax (had never been there before).  We went at about 8 p.m. on a Sunday night, and the place was pretty empty.  No lines, no wait, no screaming kids running around...perfect.  Prices were reasonable, employees (mostly high school or college kids) were friendly.  We had a blast on the go-karts, enjoyed a round of mini-golf, and played some of their arcade games.    Docking them a star for closing down the batting cages early. Place could really use some cosmetic repairs as well - the green on the mini-golf was all torn up, lighting was really poor on many of the holes (sometimes non-existent).    We'd come back, though, to blow off some steam on the go-karts again.

First time I stayed there.... so I can't compare it to what it "used to be," nor can I say that it's taken a "nose dive" or anything.  Based on my first and only experience staying there, I was impressed.  We stayed in the Palace Tower, and our room was very good sized.  Nice jetted tub in the bathroom, very comfortable bed, plenty of room to spread out.  Cool design theme too.  Just be careful that you do not even TOUCH the snack/convenience items on top of the fridge.  We accidentally knocked one down and had to immediately call the front desk so that we didn't get charged. But the room itself was very nice, and the price was reasonable.  Casino - well...it's a Vegas lobby casino.  We're not clubbers so we didn't check out any nightclubs (despite the fact that Justin Bieber happened to be in the house that night....lol).  Many restaurant choices, nice pool as well (though the drinks via the waitress cost a small fortune - one mixed drink and a water came out to $20).  Lines for check-in were a mile long, check out wasn't so bad.  Biggest word to wise is to be careful of all the little fine-print charges...the mandatory activity fee for internet and the fitness center, all of the beverages they tempt you with in the room fridge (which you can't use for your own stuff), etc...

I typically go to the McCormick Ranch or Scottsdale Road locations in Scottsdale, but  on occasion go to this location as it's close to my work.  The weight area seemed decent, but I was particularly struck by how outdated and dark the pool appeared - as compared to the other locations.  The pool plaster itself seemed dirty, rusty poles and dirty concrete around the pool, paint chipping off the ceiling... I just didn't get a clean, sanitary, slick feeling at all.  The guys locker room, particularly the showers, seemed very dingy and the lockers were quite small.  Considering this is Paradise Valley I was unpleasantly surprised.

So I've gotta lower my initial review by a star....I'm sick and tired of getting kicked out of the pool by the Aqua Fit class.  The pool is actually decent sized here, and the Aqua Fit classes are usually less than ten people.  I don't understand why they can't keep a lane or two open for those of us younger folks who would like to swim laps.  Ridiculous.  Also, as of spring 2014, there's nowhere to even buy a water in here.  Most LA Fitnesses have some kind of vending.  A bunch of juice bars/nutrition shops have come and gone inside of this LA Fitness....why don't you just simply put in a vending machine that sells water, protein shakes, etc?

The hall itself is terrific.  We thoroughly enjoyed the performance that we saw, and the musicians were top-notch.  The hall was clean, modern, sightlines were good (even from the balcony), acoustics were terrific.    My one big gripe is how awful the bar service was.  The lines were terribly long, and unbelievably slow.  There was a 20 minute intermission, and we left the balcony to get in line right at the beginning of it.  We never made it up to the bar to get a drink.  Um....?  Why not have a bar on the balcony level?  This was unacceptable, but yet another example of Phoenix's inability to handle large crowds.    However - I reiterate - the performance itself was terrific.

Just flew out of here for the first time, and it was a nice change of pace from the larger airports.  It's clean, well-organized, parking is close by (albeit pricey - $11/day).  There are a few restaurants and gift shops inside (though the Paradise Bakery is terribly slow and understaffed).  Seating by the gate areas was plentiful.  No ridiculous crowds.  I'll take it!

My parents were in town from Chicago and were looking for a good breakfast and coffee spot.  We'd already been to the Breakfast Club the previous morning, which was outstanding, so we went to Coco's for the sake of variety.  I'd been there a few times over a year ago and had good experiences, so I didn't hesitate to take them there on a Monday morning around 10ish.  We were seated and ordered, and after waiting 30 minutes for our food (and not receiving it) we began to worry, despite the clientele in the restaurant that Monday morning to be fairly sparse.   We watched another table walk out.  30 minutes became 40 minutes, and the server said our food would be right up.  We asked to speak to the manager, and a gruff, dirty looking man came to our table.  He never accepted the blame and in turn blamed the one server and one cook that were working, and uttered excuses like "we're still recovering from the Marathon two days ago".... what???  He never tried to right the wrongs or comp us anything, he just assured us our meals would be ready in a few minutes.  We noticed other tables complaining as well, and after giving them a few more undeserved minutes of our time, we walked out.  I made sure to let them know that I was embarassed for having taken my out of town guests there, and instead of offering apologies himself, the manager pointed to the server and demanded he apologize.  If I were that server, I'd have quit that day.    Horrible experience, they don't deserve your business and they won't get mine again.

Went in here for the first time recently, intending to use the appetizer/wine tasting Groupon.  Upon walking in, the hostess seemed inconvenienced and asked "Can I help you?"  Well,um, we'd like a table (duh).  Though there were some open, she said they were all "reserved," so we asked if we could sit at one of the many that were open outside.  She went and checked to see if they were available, then came back and said they weren't going to open the outside.   Hmmm... well that's a bad business decision.  People arriving and waiting for tables, all the tables inside are "reserved," there's plenty of tables available outside on a beautiful evening, yet they won't open that area.  We walked out and didn't think twice about it.

My wife and I loved this place!  The menu was outstanding - thoroughly impressed with the wide variety.  I had the New England Clam Bake - delicious lobster, clams and mussels... the clam chowder was delicious as well.  My wife had the ono, which she thoroughly enjoyed, too.  Highly recommend the oyster sampler as an appetizer.  We took home some bread pudding for a late night dessert too.  Service was great, lots of good recommendations from our waitress.  We went to Wildfish near Fashion Square not long ago, and I'd have to say we'd return to King's way before going back to Wildfish.  Much more reasonable, price-wise, as well.  No complaints - they made a great first impression on us!

A solid place for a quick breakfast in Vegas, especially if you're staying at Caesar's.  High prices, but again, you're in Vegas so would you expect anything different?  The lox were good - nothing fancy, but they did the job.  The oj was freshly squeezed - that was obvious - and it was very good.  Service was prompt and attentive, and the bread they served before our meal came was tasty.  For my wife and us, our bill was a bit over $70.... that's high for us for breakfast....but have I mentioned that you're in Vegas?

Great staff, very friendly..... very thorough and professional service, clean facilities and tv's on the ceiling to watch make the whole process more relaxing.  Despite being a newcomer to them and to the area, they know exactly who I am when I go in now.  A great change of pace from my previous dentist.

If I could give it a zero, I would.  We went there upon returning home from a Diamondbacks game, and the meathead bouncers wouldn't let us in because we were wearing Diamondbacks jerseys (1 of us) and Diamondbacks t-shirts (the rest of us).  So wait.... they advertise themselves as a sports bar (according to their Facebook page and here on Yelp), yet you can't wear sports apparel in there?  Now that makes great sense!  One of the girls in our group jokingly said to the meathead/bouncer that she'd give him $20 to let us in.  Of course that caught his interest.  When she explained to him that she was only joking and called him a jagoff, he entered a state of mass confusion (too much for Mr. Meathead Bouncer to comprehend).   We gladly took our business across the street to the Lodge while the bouncers scratched their heads, and the Lodge openly welcomed us and our Dbacks attire.  Since our conversation continued to revolve around AJ's outlandish and hypocritical policy, we walked by there again afterwards and asked for clarification, and to speak to a manager.  The "manager" turned out to be a Mega- Meathead/Douchebag, and he rambled a bunch of stuff off that didn't make much sense.  When they became physically aggressive towards our group we walked away.  We'll definitely be contacting management to let them know of our horrific experience with this "bar."

We've loved the classes we've taken there.  We started taking classes before our wedding over a year ago, and we got hooked.  We were able to work privately with one of the instructors to prepare for our wedding in addition to taking weekly ballroom classes.  As beginners, we didn't feel out of place, and the others in our classes were very friendly.    After taking a hiatus for a while, we returned to find the studio had been expanded and renovated.  There's so much more space now, and more class offerings at a variety of levels.  We started taking one of the swing courses, and the instructor is outstanding and makes the class enjoyable. It's affordable too.  Such a fun mid-week activity and social opportunity.  Glad we found this place.

All these high reviews, and rightfully so.  I've had some HORRID experiences with movers, so this was a breath of fresh air.  They were on time (a rarity these days), friendly, and moved quickly.  They even took the time to tighten up some lose joints on a desk to make sure it was sturdy.    Price was unbelievably reasonable, no hidden charges or surprises.  Would absolutely call these guys again.

Not a bad place.  Not bad at all, actually.  A nice alternative when their neighbor, Zipps, is jammed - or when you want a lower-key outing.  Somewhat of a hole-in-the-wall, but my wife and I were impressed with the food (considering it was a bar).  Drink selection isn't bad, and their service was friendly and prompt.  We'll be back in.

We recently purchased a new home, and being new to the area, found ABP on Yelp.  Bob came by and quoted us, and my wife and I chose him for our interior paint job.  Bob and his son (Bob) were personable, friendly, and honest right from the start.  They were able to get started on the job quickly - I believe it was the following week - and finished our 2800 sq. foot home in about 3 or 4 days.  And the job was thorough and professional, too - not just a quick coat of paint slapped on the walls.  He followed up with us a few weeks later when our floors were complete to come and touch up the baseboards, and we also had him paint our hallway cabinets which turned out great as well.  My wife commented on how friendly his crew was, so all things considered, we were very glad we chose ABP.  Thanks Bob and Bob!

Could be a fun location, and the "scenery" was awfully nice as well.  Since we weren't allowed to eat on the deck with our small dog (and I think they'd do a LOT more business if they were pet-friendly, considering their location), we had to order our food to go.  We ordered two sandwiches (a turkey sandwich and a catfish sandwich) which took almost a half hour to make.... wondering if they had to go out and catch the fish and turkey first.  Once we finally did get it, it was pretty good.    In observing the deck area, it seemed there was a lecherous older gentlemen coming on to many of the servers, who eventually managed to talk his way on to somebody's boat for an afternoon excursion.  Provided for some fun people-watching.    Overall, decent.....but it could be so much more.

We've eaten here twice now and have enjoyed it both times.  It's on the second floor of the Tropicana, and if you can get a seat on the outside it's fun to watch all the interesting people going up and down the hallway.    Service was polite and friendly, food has always been good.  On our most recent visit we had an appetizer comprised of meats and cheeses, which was pretty big for just the two of us.  For my entree I had the seafood taglioline, which was great.  A good amount of food, prepared well....our entrees didn't come out as quickly as we would've liked.  We never commented on it, but in the end, the server took a round of drinks of the bill because of it.  Guess he agreed.  A bit pricey, but hey, it's Vegas so it's not unexpected.  All things considered, we'd go back.

We're new to the neighborhood, and this place is quickly becoming our weekend hangout.  Not a whole lot of bars around here to choose from, but this has been our favorite.  Nice big bar with lots of room and tv's.  Friendly service.  Food is actually pretty good.  Seems like there's always a different crowd in there - one night it's a crazy party with confetti and squirt guns full of liquor, the next night it's completely mellow with candles burning.  Never know what to expect, but that's sorta cool.    I'd give them a fifth star if they'd 1) expand their draft beer selection, and 2) clean up the filthy bathrooms.

Been here a few times now, and have never really had any complaints.  The food always tastes fresh and flavorful, and I've never left feeling overly stuffed (like on the verge of passing out!) - which is a very good thing!  I've particularly liked the fish entrees (salmon and rainbow trout).  And the desserts are great - the perfect size to polish off a tasty meal.  We'll be back!

Well, so much for this guy.  Looks like he does great work, but we'll never find out.  Chatted with him on the phone, set up an appointment for him to come by and give us some bathroom remodeling ideas on the following Monday (Tuesday if his job ran long on Monday).  Monday came and went, Tuesday came and went..... never came by, never heard from him.  It takes 2-3 minutes max to make a call and say "I need to reschedule, something came up."  If he flaked out on the initial appt, what would happen if we actually hired him?

Disappointed.  Came to watch football here on a Sunday morning.  We entered to find sticky tables (that we had to wipe off ourselves), and a very sparse clientele.  We ordered food, which took a very long time to arrive despite the small crowd, and when it arrived it definitely wasn't anything special.   It was warm in there (was the ac on?), and service was sketchy.  Whenever we needed something, we had to track them down instead of them checking in on us.  Will probably find a new spot to watch the game.

Great service.  They truly live up to their name and are "good guys."  Dealt with Mike on each occasion - had him install some outdoor garage lights and landscape lighting at our new home, as well as fixing a few other minor electrical issues.  Mike was friendly, personable, and efficient.  The price was reasonable for what we were having done.  When he was unable to complete the work on day he said it would be done, he came out on a Sunday to finish the job.  Now that's commitment to customers.    They're popular, so they'll require some lead time.  But rightfully so.  We will certainly turn to them again if the situation requires.

If your idea of a fun night out is standing shoulder to shoulder watching a room full of douchebags and plastic women in a bar, then this is the place for you.  Will not go back.  Too loud, too packed, too fake.  Bartenders were more concerned about performing then pouring (some guy behind the bar was juggling, and then drinking liqour, from his SHOES...???), the meatheads in the bar were pre-occupied with shining up their sunglasses (that they wear "at night")....the entire vibe in this place is overwhelmingly douchey.  Overpriced, too.  At the bottom of my list for old town bars.

We recently hired Skywoods to complete two rooms in our new home, and we couldn't be happier with the results.  Steve and Caroline were friendly to deal with, efficient in their work, on schedule, and extremely talented artists as well as painters.  They did a faux finish in one of our office rooms, and a metallic effect in our half-bath.  For the final product that we received, the price was reasonable as well.  Highly recommended.

We had a problem with our outdoor landscape lighting.  Based on their Yelp reviews I gave them a call on a Saturday.  They scheduled an appt with us for the following Friday.  They were on time, successfully troubleshot and repaired the problem, and charged us a reasonable amount.  A hassle-free experience.  Wouldn't hesitate to call again.

Want to be clear - this review was for Cuoco Pazzo, NOT the tavern that replaced it... (they automatically changed the name, but didn't start a new review page)...I really miss Cuoco Pazzo and wish they wouldn't have closed...review below:  Been here three times now, and if this review were based strictly on the first two visits it would receive a full five stars.  The food was outstanding - we made sure to compliment the chef - the service was prompt and friendly, a great drink menu, and really nice ambiance.  I highly recommended this place to out-of-towners, or just to people who had never been there.    However, on my most recent (and third) visit, we noticed that this place had started to slip a bit.  It was very empty on a Saturday night - which probably isn't a good sign.  Despite how empty it was, the service was very slow and it took surprisingly long for simple items like a bowl of soup to arrive.  They'd done away with their cocktail list on their drink menu too.  The food, when it came, was still just as good, but it seems like they'd cut back  - and it showed.    Really rooting for this place since their food is so good and I had two really good experiences there.

Very good!  Nice atmosphere (we sat outside on a Saturday night....music inside was too loud), good food, good service.  I thought that their selection of beers was good, and their food was definitely a couple notches above most bar food offerings.  My steak, which I'm usually picky about, was cooked very well.  Disappointed I couldn't substitute mashed potatoes for baked, but the baked potato was good nonetheless.  We will keep this place in mind in the future.

We love this event.  What a terrific way to spend a Sunday afternoon, perusing the work of so many talented artists.  It's wonderfully organized and creates such a great "community" feel.  Such a great variety of vendors.    Shame on the Scottsdale Gallery Association for trying to stop this event.

We really expected problems based on all the previous reviews... and no I am not an Allegiant employee, etc.  We needed to get to Moline, IL for a wedding and the one flight out from Mesa, and the one flight back from the QC Airport in IL matched up perfectly to our timeline.  Yes, the booking process was annoying ($17 for an aisle seat, etc) but as long as you read the "fine print" and know what you're getting into it's not so bad.  Even after all the nickel and diming, the final price was still considerably cheaper than our alternatives.  Print your boarding pass in advance, don't overpack.... Our carry-ons were on the larger side and we were worried that they'd say something, but they didn't even really look at our bags.  The seats didn't recline on the plane, they charged for all beverages and snacks ($2 for pop or water, $6 for beers...not exorbitant), no fancy tv screens with ads and movies playing the whole time, no wi-fi...but this flight was cheap and got us to our destination and back safely and on-time.  That's all we needed.  Based on this experience, I'd fly them again.

Damn was this place good!  I'll take this over the former resident Oreganos (which made me sick) any day!  Beer brat was perfect, and the fries were delish.  We started with a hot pretzel which was tasty as well.  Great selection of beer, and we loved the outdoor ambiance.  Even though we were sitting outside on a chilly January evening (due to a ridiculously large party indoors... the only minus of the night), their many heat lamps kept us warm.  Will definitely be back.  Such a nice change of pace from the typical douchebaggy establishments of Scottsdale.

Off to a good start...hoping they stay open since others in the area keep shutting down (adios Nimbus).  Beer selection was good - especially enjoyed the Irish Red - and the ambiance was appealing.  Pizza was fair, as my search for acceptable pizza in the valley continues.  Wish there were other options besides pizza.  Overall a good experience - rooting for this place.

Wow!  What a nice surprise.  I'd been by this place numerous times, and it doesn't look like much from the outside (especially considering the two places it's sandwiched between).  But my wife and I were looking for something new to try, so we stopped in for dinner.  We noticed it was very busy on a random Tuesday evening - probably a good sign.  We also noticed everybody was genuinely friendly inside: the host, our waiter, the manager.... The decor was nice too.  And the food was outstanding.  I started with the butternut squash soup, which I usually am not a fan of but the server really sold it on us.  I was not disappointed at all - it was delicious.  Garnished with duck ravioli and full of flavor.  For my entree I had the scallops.  Again, lots of flavor, served over mashed potatoes and topped with fresh sprouts.  Delicious, and not overly filling either.  My wife really enjoyed her natural roasted chicken and wine.  With our entrees being so good, we took home some bread pudding for dessert.    Overall, very pleasantly surprised.  We'd intended to grab a quick bite, but this turned into an outstanding meal.  We will definitely return.  (And it takes a lot for me to give five stars!)....

Pleasantly surprised....I love Polish food and it's hard to find in the valley.  I took a recommendation and gave this place a shot.  The meal portions were good - you get a choice of 3 sides.  I had the Polish combo platter (unfortunately they were out of Polish sausage on our visit, which was a bummer).  The pierogies were very good, and while they cabbage rolls were decent, I have to say that they were rather small.  Had much better at Polish Fest.... and, of course, in Krakow.    Liked the fact that they had native Polish beers.  Their Black Boss Porter was very tasty.    Friendly service, clean environment....I'd go back.

Finally, it seems that this location is taking off.  It was amazing how dead it was when we visited the prior restaurant in this location, despite the good food.  However, Evo has amp'd up the atmosphere, maintained the good service, and produced some tasty food.  Thus, the place was hoppin' on a Friday evening and for a change, it was hard to find a parking spot in the lot on this visit.   So it was not the hard-to-find location that was the problem with the previous tenants...  Tony was our server, and he was excellent.  Very personable and helpful.  We started with the scallops, which were flavorful and good sized.  My wife enjoyed her chicken entree, and my lobster risotto, though it appeared small in size at first, was actually very filling and well prepared.  They had a pretty good selection of drinks, and we also liked the bread that accompanied our appetizers.     Nice ambiance, great makeover to the space, friendly service, and good food.  We'll be back!

Came here for the first time on a weeknight, not in a huge hurry to go back. Was one of those "we live nearby, still haven't been there" type of things.  Upon entering, we noticed it was very dark. zero lighting in the entryway, no host to greet or seat us....but one eventually came. Service was okay, no real complaints. Menu was decent...we both had the corned beef dinner and shared a shrimp flat bread.  I've had better, but this was certainly passable.  My biggest gripe, I think, is how dingy and depressing it feels. The entire place is virtually all painted black. No character, no calling card...liven this place up!  Lots of potential but they're missin' the boat!

Cool place....we're big fans of Fate Brewing just down the street, but came into SBC since they're open later.  Cool atmosphere, lots of space, though a bit tucked away off the road and hard to spot.    I tried two of their beers - their porter and a stout.  Both were very good, had lots of flavor and despite the stout being pretty strong, it didn't taste that way.  Soft pretzels were good (though Fate still takes the prize), and my wife enjoyed her hummus plate.  Friendly service as well.    I'd definitely return - seems they're off to a great start.

Went on a Tuesday night, and it was really empty. A place like this, especially during baseball playoffs, should be hopping. Not one person at the bar.   The young girl that was our server was pleasant, but never came back to check on us throughout the meal. I'd have liked a water refill and another beverage. Food was...blah. My wife asked for her chicken blackened, and they burn it.  My pig wing dinner wasn't anything special.  Portion sizes were decent.  Decor was pretty cool, and their setup was good. They need to do something unique, though. I could see a smoker or BBQ on the patio...but something is needed to pump this place up.  So many places have folded in this space...Haymaker needs to do something soon so that it doesn't follow their footsteps.
