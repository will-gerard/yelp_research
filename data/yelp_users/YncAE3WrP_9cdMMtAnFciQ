OK, for full disclosure, this is based on the food, which was delivered to my hotel room, not an actual dinning experience in this location.  Nevertheless, not a fan! From the get go there was a lot of confusion on their end whether or not they would deliver to my hotel. Well, if this establishment went to the trouble of placing a menu in my room, not just the lobby, but in my room, one would think they'd convey this to their employees. It seemingly took forever to decide where my hotel was and if they delivered there or not. Once it was established they would, we finally got to ordering.  I ordered a basic "Cheesy Beef" sandwich, along with an order of "Ranch Fries." Well the sandwich was tender and seemingly large enough, but seriously salty, which was a bit odd. The ranch fries were definitely a large portion as well, but nothing special. It was delivered in decent time, but here's the clincher, no fork, no napkin, no nothing! Come on folks, if you want into the delivery end of things, you need to provide the basics. They did not, plus the food itself was not very good! It wasn't horrendous, mind you, but I'll not order from them again.

This is a Fat Man's wet dream! Seriously, for a very reasonable price ALL YOU CAN EAT Filipino food! Heaven! Maybe not the best place to visit if you're trying to watch your waistline, but otherwise you can not go wrong here!  Everything you need, to include lechon, is in the food line, finished off with self serve rice. And like any good buffet, go back for as many trips as you like. Like I wrote though, if you have self control issues like I do, and you're on a diet, do NOT go here! Otherwise enjoy! It's truly a small piece of Filipino heaven.  My only complaints are limited seating and it's mainly a lunch place, so no late night grub runs can be made. Hence the 4 stars opposed to 5. It's really a 4.5 rating, though.   ALBUQUERQUE, we need a place like this!

Does one really think about sushi at 1100 a.m.? Well, that's when they open and that's when we popped in. So I don't think they were expecting a party of 10 that early, but they stepped up regardless! Kudos for that! And kudos to the young gal working our party, she did a bang-up job!   This place has a nice vibe! Great d√©cor, very clean and seemingly appropriate for their food genre. The sushi itself, spot on! Now for full disclosure, though I love sushi, I don't eat it enough to know the going prices. So six bucks per sushi selection (two pieces of sushi) seemed a bit steep to me. So needless to say/write, I didn't walk away full, but I did walk away satisfied, if that makes any sense.  I'd return, though, that's for certain! And if you have not tried them, you should!

Coworkers during this past weekend drug me here for lunch as some were in the mood for wings. I mean let's face it, aren't we all in the mood for wings from time to time? Save those evil Vegans, of course. Nevertheless, beins' I'm from out of town and never heard of this joint I agreed, and I was pleased!   Mind you, I opted out of the wing mode and opted in to a sandwich. I know, sacrilegious right? I chose JD Salinger's sandwich, Turkey in the Rye - Grilled marble rye bread, stacked with chopped turkey, Swiss cheese, tangy coleslaw, and honey mustard dressing. It rocked! And I did not regret my choice one bit!   We sat in the bar with so many TV screens to look at I was confused as to where I should focus! It was nice, though, good service from Amber, and a good vibe all around.   "I ordered a Scotch and soda, and told him not to mix it--I said it fast as hell, because if you hem and haw, they think you're under twenty-one and won't sell you any intoxicating liquor. I had trouble with him anyway, though. "I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but do you have some verification of your age? Your driver's license, perhaps?" I gave him this very cold stare, like he'd insulted the hell out of me, and asked him, "Do I look like I'm under twenty-one?"  "I'm sorry, sir, but we have our--"  No, unlike Holden Caulfield's attempt at ordering alcohol, we were in uniform, so I settled for an Arnold Palmer. However, if it were evening hours I think this place would satiate anyone's thirst. And for full disclosure, I did try one of my friend's wings, and it was pretty good! So next time around, I think I might dive in and try a plate full of some honey hot wings, and so should you!

For full disclosure, I have a weakness for anything pizza orientated, therefore, my opinion might be a bit skewed, and I've only tried one item from their menu, so take this review with a grain of salt, or oregano for that matter, but I loved this awesome little Mom & Pop place.  I was in town on business, but was hankerin' for something 'local' and non fast foody, if you will. So I whipped out my trusty phone and Yelped my way to this little gem. Nothing fancy, nothing awe inspiring by the looks of it, but still very clean and roomy! It indeed had that true neighborhood feel to it, and if I lived in said neighborhood, I assure you I'd try many more items from their menu.   So when perusing the busy menu, the calzone leaped out at me. I hadn't had a good calzone in eons, so why not I thought. So I ordered a simple calzone with sausage and tomatoes, and it did NOT disappoint! Baked to perfection with a golden brown crispy crust, you know, the carb lovers dream version. Piping hot out of the oven and she was a true work of art! Nice and flavorful, great texture and consistency. Very cheesy! I loved it! In fact, if I did live in the area I might not get around to too many other items on their menu as I'd keep going back to the tried and true. It was THAT good!   However, I assume their pizzas and subs are pretty good as well. I almost ordered a tasty looking meatball sub that was calling my name also, but the calzone won that battle. The employees seemed very friendly and I have a feeling I'll be returning on future trips quite often. And so should you!

YUP! I was already a fan based on their Calzone, but after trying their Meatball Sub, I'm sold! May I buy stock?   Big, flavorful, and the bread they use, OMG! Apparently they have it specially made for them daily and it is so fresh and soft. For a lack of a more original description, it seemingly "Melts in Your Mouth."  It was REALLY good! I ordered a full, which is really large enough for two and thankfully they cut it in half, which makes it easy to take the other half home with you. However, I cannot lie, it was so good I had to take a few bites of my other half, which was supposed to go home with me.   Now, if I'm being 100% honest here, it could have used a smidge more sauce, but now I'm just being anal! This place is where it's at!
