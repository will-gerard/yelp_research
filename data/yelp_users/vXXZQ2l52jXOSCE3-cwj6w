Not the best sports bar but nice patio. TVs too small for the size of the place. Avoid Sunday football, not well set up for breakfast or coffee.

Fail. Might be good for scooters but a total failure on bikes. Brought my mountain bike to them, and after three weeks had to call them to find out that it still wasn't tuned-up. They recommended more than $300 of extra work, and when I didn't get that, they utterly failed on the tune-up. I was returned (after my bike was lost) a dirty, un-lubed, mountain bike with flat tires. I'm guessing these other reviews are from friends of the owner (the killer flaw in all these review sites) because this business has no sense of customer service.

Fail not. As it is most of the time, the breakdown in my tune-up was mostly around communication with my experience with Urban Commuter. Once was was cleared up, good care was taken with my bike. It was returned to me clean and in tip-top condition, ready to romp on the mountain. Thanks Urban Commuter for a good customer service.

The fried calamari was as cold as the reception by our surly waitress, and the chopped Greek salad was as depressing as the actual Greek economy. If this place produced food as good as the decor I would return but it is not to be.  The employee eating next to us received far better and friendly service, and given his ample girth, that is something he's taken advantage many times. This place only pretends to be a restaurant.

What the hell is it with a host that isn't open to you picking a table of your liking, especially when the joint is near empty? This jerk was clearly put out that we would have the temerity to choose our table, which was required given that the spot lighting was so bright on certain table we could have effectively performed surgery. Would have sat on the nice patio with a fire going, but the lighting out there was again overblown.  Our ebullient waitress kept us there with her friendliness and steered us toward good appetizers and a light Chardonnay. Reluctantly, given my recent run of back luck with calamari, I ordered the app and bravely dove in. Hot and crispy but the sauce suffered. The marinara sauce we asked for was far better. Our Caprese salad was good, fresh.  If not for the gargoyle at the front I would have considered this a good experience.

Before I had the misfortune of eating at The Roadhouse I didn't think it was possible to screw up bacon. Bacon, I think we can all agree, is the greatest food ever. It makes everything it's paired with better. The Roadhouse served me soggy, odd tasting bacon that had me convinced that the name of the restaurant was The Roadkill Cafe. The coffee was flavored water. Our waitress ate her lunch just a few tables over while she served us. And even though French toast were on the menu, we were told we it was no longer available because not enough people order it. And they had just opened the doors. The Roadhouse is going for a "rough" look with the decor (kind of like Chipotle's), but it just looks un-finished and crappy.  Until Rick, I do not wish them luck. These people should not be in the restaurant business. They should clean out septic tanks or deal in scrap metal or something where quality, customer service and cleanliness aren't important. The over/under on the date of The Roadhouses's demise I put at June 10.
