I haven't yelped in a long time but my experience this morning was so great, that I have to. My boyfriend and I are house sitting this weekend in the neighborhood and so we wanted to find a local breakfast place this morning. I checked my Yelp app to see what was around and this showed up.  The staff was phenomenal. The inside is kinda small and was pretty loud (it was busy) so we sat outside. We interacted with three different staff members (1 who sat us inside, the waitress who would have been waiting on us had we kept our table inside and then our waitress when we moved to an outside table). All were friendly and had smiles on their faces. Genuine smiles.   The menu was wonderful and everything sounded great. The salsa is made fresh daily and it was to die for so if you can get something that comes with the salsa, do it.  One breakfast burrito, a side of sausage, eggs Benedict w/bacon and two cups of coffee was only $21. Great prices, great staff, amazing food.  Even though we live downtown Phoenix, we will be coming back to Wanda's!!

This restaurant is one of my top five in all of the Valley. I eat at FEZ usually about once a week I love it so much! There are so many great things that this restaurant offers to our community. FEZ has such a great mix of customers as well as a mixed staff.  The staff at this place is off the charts. Every staff member offers a personal touch in their own way and they always seem so happy! The people that work at FEZ are the ideal servers...you know, the ones that you think aren't real! The kinds that don't bother you ever 5 minutes to verify that you are doing okay, yet the kind that always makes sure your drinks are full. It's fantastic.  Now for the best part: The Food!! I have yet to try something at FEZ that I am not a fan of. I grew up always demanding the food I wanted, which always kept me from trying new things, thus made me an extremely picky eater. FEZ is one of the places that I am not afraid to try anything. The food is amazing, the drinks are strong, and the staff is fabulous. It really doesn't get much better than that does it? Oh yes, actually it does: they have monthly meal specials and a drink special every night of the week! You can't beat that!

This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. EVER. I am a giant fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts and the first time I went to The Yard - I was so excited. Conceptually, the design is stellar. However, I will not be returning. I called to set a reservation of 12 for my birthday this past Saturday. I was told they did not take reservations. Turns out, they do. I have had several friends that have been told they do not take reservations and another set of friends that say that they have actually made reservations. I found out upon my arrival, they do indeed take reservations. They need to get their story straight.  Anyway, we show up at 3:15pm and put our name on a list for 12. We were told 1 hour to 1.5 hour wait. No problem, we went to the bar. While at the bar, the staff was literally fumbling over one another and it was not even that busy. The entire bar (people we did not even know) were all complaining about the time it took to order one drink due to the lack of attention from the bar staff.   At 4:30, I go to check in with the hostesses. They had sat a different group at our table and said they would try to find us a new table. This was a result of their miscommunication as a staff. They were not able to clear a table for us right away to rectify their own mistake, so they sat us in a lounge area about 10 minutes later until they could find us a table. However, we would have to vacate the lounge area by 6pm because -wait for it - someone had a reservation for the lounge area at 6. My only prayer was that we certainly wouldn't still be waiting for a table at 6pm (nearly 3 hours later!).   The waitress for our lounge area was so incredibly rude that I cannot put it into words. I have never had that poor of an attitude from a staff member at any restaurant, especially Fox. After the biggest let down of giving our table away, I was hoping perhaps they would offer to buy us a pitcher of beer or some appetizers. We received one bowl of chips and one fondue dish...for the entire group. We had to wait over 15 minutes for one round of drinks (that we were charged full price for). It was not until the time was nearing 5:30pm that the manager seemed to get proactive about finding us a table. Fast forward to 5:45pm (2.5 hours after arriving) and there is no table that even seems to be in sight for us to be seated at and we are still receiving horrendous service. We decide to go down the street to Zipps where they could seat us immediately. Can you imagine how hungry we are? Arriving at 3:15pm ready to eat?  The manager noticed we were leaving and came over to try and get us to stay. I had been so incredibly respectful, nice and understanding throughout the entire process until I hit my breaking point as we were leaving. I explained that people literally spent money to fly in for this birthday because it was a very special birthday and we chose The Yard for a reason! However, the experience at the Yard ruined my birthday. Upon unloading on the manager, they took care of ONE of my $7 drinks (woohoo?) and he sent me on my way with a free brownie.   It truly seems as if they only hired for looks at this restaurant because everyone that we encountered may have been good looking, but seemingly had never worked in the restaurant/hospitality/service industry. I have never been so disappointed in a dining experience. The manager asked for my email address so that they could invite us back and give us a special experience. It took him four days to send that follow up email (I received it this morning...prompting this review). Any professional would have sent a sincere apology within 24 hours, which is typical business practice.   Is there a chance that my group was the exception to the rule? Possibly. However, I am not willing to return and find out. In fact, I will not be returning to any Fox concept for quite a while. Disappointment does not begin to describe my experience at The Yard. Possible patrons beware!
