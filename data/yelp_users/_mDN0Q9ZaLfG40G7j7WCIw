I would have to say that I have had the absolute worst experience at Video Paradise!! If I could give this place a 0 I would.   I took in my PS3 game to be cleaned because they advertize it, saying "we repair". I handed over my game to the first lady who put the game into the machine and ran it the first time and it came out with a lot of circular scratches all over the disc. She continued to put it in the machine 3 more times. Another worker came over and said let me try and told me that they seem to be having an issue with the machine. He then tried to cycle the disc through 2 more times. After the circular marks did not come out they called someone from the back named Dustin. This person tried cleaning it again a few more times. He then said "it does not seem to be cleaning it correctly because its a blu-ray". THEN WHY WOULD YOU PUT IT INTO THE MACHINE SO MANY TIMES IF YOU KNOW ITS NOT GOING TO WORK???  He handed the disc back to me telling me that its not working. I then told him, "what happens now if I take the game home and it does not work"? He said "well we can take it from that point".   I brought the game home and tried it in the PS3. The machine no longer recognizes the disc at all.   I called the store and was able to get Dustin on the phone. All that he would say is " I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU"!   So I took my disc into the store working fine and they ruined it. I will NEVER be returning to there.  I wouldn't have even cared if they would have even replaced the disc with a used one. But to blatantly say "I'M NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU" is so wrong. The worst experience ever!!!

Cafe Rio...First of all I would like to say that I do not typically leave reviews. Waaaaay overpriced for the amount of food that they give you! We paid $37 for 4 burritos and drinks. Could have had burritos at Los Fav's on Cooper & Ray for half the price! The girl making the food was trying to rush us when there wasn't anyone else in line. We asked for shredded beef & they said we would have to wait an additional 15 for it to be cooked. Shouldn't they have this type of food available and ready if it's on the menu? They could have at least dried off the trays before putting all of our food on em & serving us. Two employees were throwing water bottles at each other in the dining area where the customers eat. Very unprofessional!! Extremely dissatisfied!! We will never return here!!!
