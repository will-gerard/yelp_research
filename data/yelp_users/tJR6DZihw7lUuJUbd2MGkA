This place was so excellent in picking out my wife's engagement ring, wedding band & my wedding band as  well! I went in August when they were having an estate sale & was able to get a killer deal on the merchandise.   I worked with Wendy, she genuinely cared about what was going on with our engagement process & helped out so much!  I have recommended this place over & over again to my friends looking to become engaged & continue to recommend it because of the great service & pricing here.

This place was great! From the time I walked in, the barbers (all of them) greeted me! Kerry cut my hair and did a great job. She didn't take very long. The prices are not bad and the customers seem to have very good rapport with the employees!

This place is okay. Definitely for an older crowd. My wife and I went here with some friends for the first time about a month ago, and I was not impressed. The food was eh and the live music was eh, it was more entertaining to watch the older people just dancing to the music.

As long as I live in the area, I will take my guitars here for repair/servicing. The repair shop here is great and the store part is good as well. Great turnaround time on repairs!

My wife and I love this spot! Great drinks, delicious food! They no longer have live music, which is a bummer but other than that, it's great!

This was a perfect place to go for a breakfast meal with my wife. We loved to watch the planes & helicopters take off! Would recommend it to at least check it out!

I'm originally from Illinois so when I heard about this place, I was super excited. The food was delicious for sure, the catfish was amazing. The hot link dinner was good, wish there was more bread that came with it. The most disappointing part about this experience was the peach cobbler, all it was is a cup of peaches in the juice with cinnamon or between sugar. I wasn't very happy. Overall, good experience. Dessert was disappointing.

Pretty good place. The live music quality is pretty poor. However, the wings are delicious. Specifically the raspberry chipotle wings! Downside: No Moscow Mules.

The portions are great. Always have leftovers! I think that it is one of the best chinese restaurants i've been to in AZ. Definitely better than pei-way. If you are in the area. Do it.

Great food! We were greater quickly upon arriving. Once we ordered, the food do not take a very long time to arrive. Food presentation is great!  4 star because the fish pond at the front is very dirty and the koi fish in there, you can barely see.

This Starbucks is easily, the slowest one that we have been to. They seem to be full staffed however, at this very moment we have been waiting 15 minutes for our ONE drink. It's just not normal Starbucks time to wait this long.  Some staff changes likely need to change here in order to get things flowing well!

My wife and I came here for the first time today. We were greeted immediately which was awesome. There was no wait for us. We sat down and ordered drinks. Their hot chocolate is amazing! The crepes were presented very well and tasted delicious!   Why I gave this place 4 stars: we ordered within 10 minutes of arriving and didn't receive our food until about 45 minutes into our visit here. The server also forgot to bring us waters and we had to ask again, not a huge deal but still. With these notes: there were only, three servers working. Unsure of cook staffing.  Also, we ordered a side of bacon and received bacon that looked as if it was precooked bacon that you would buy, it was very thin and not very good.

Only been living here for a week and so far, I give this place a 5 star rating. The employees are very nice and the property itself is beautiful.   The one thing that, in my opinion keeps this away from 5 stars is the trees and their leaves that get my car pretty messy, that's a small thing so aside from that, I love my new home!

Unfortunately this complex underwent new management back in November/December of 2014. Alliance. And the new staff is pretty horrific. The office manger or assistant office manager spoke very rudely to my wife, spoke down to her like she was unintelligent.  They also screwed up our final rent bill, and final move out charges that we had to contact the corporate office.  Really hoping that they undergo some staff changes and it would be better!

It was awesome! Got to listen to some live music which my wife and I love! Nice simple Jazz music! Wish we could have had a cigar but no worries, no cigar no problem! We had a great time nonetheless

I have been coming to this place for about two years. The staff is so friendly and nice people. The sweetest, funniest owners. I love the $7 option for students. If you are in the area, and want an inexpensive, great haircut. Check it out!

Great time here! Loved the hot dogs! We got he crispy dog and something else! It was all so good! Only downside is that it was SO hot in the building.   Other than that, great food!

The food here was great! We always enjoy eating ph√≥ & hanging with friends! The service was not that great there however, the server was nice & recommended somethings for us there but it just took him a while to actually come to us, to take our order. Would definitely go again though!

The manager was very welcoming and greeted us soon as we walked in. He showed us the menu (150 choices) and gave us great pointers.   The wait was a little long but the manager brought everyone that was waiting for their food FREE macaroni salad which was delicious as well! This place is great and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me!
