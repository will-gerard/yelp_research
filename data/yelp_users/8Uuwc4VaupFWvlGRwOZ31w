AJ's is a fantastic supermarket. Don't buy your staples here as you will do better at the other chains. AJ's is strictly high-end meat, seafood,cheese, wine, deli, bakery.   The wine selection is the best you will find in any Phoenix metro area store and the beer selection is equally as good. if they don't have it, ask and in most cases they can get it for you. The meats and seafood in awesome. Prime cut USDA aged beef, quality seafood..however its pricey.   They also have cigars as well as a great flower shop. If I haven't planned for Valentines day AJ's is the one stop I make on my way home.

Great place to take a break on a different take on new Mexican cuisine instead of the constant sonoran style Mexican food were used to here in the valley.   The restaurant itself has an odd decor that will have you thinking more of LOST, or Gilligan's Island instead of the famous caverns. I believe it used to be a Polynesian restaurant back in the day, many moons ago.   The food is great here and the portions huge. They do have some Mexican beers on draft which is also great. My wife loves and swears by the Lobster enchiladas and my buddy and I spilt the Habenero burger. Thank god we split it as its by far the hottest burger this side of the Rio Grande.   Carlsbad does a really great chili both red and green and I haven't veered to far off the menu for other entrees.   I recommend it if your looking for great casual evening out with Friends or if your just driving by and in the mood for a great lunch.

La Fonda is my steady Mexican food joint in town. The best (Bar None) Chips and salsa in town..hands down. You will gorge yourself on the chips and salsa. The best red chili con carne. I never deviate from these two items..thats all I get. My wife likes the breakfast burrito, and a buddy swears by the albondigas soup.   The margs are tasty but get the premium tequila (Patron). A pitcher is what I recommend.  If your into looks then this restaurant is not for you. I wouldn't be surprised to see things running across the floor. Its not fancy, some would call it a sty, but its all good in my book.

We have been going to Alberto's for over a year and my wife and I love it. It's one of our favorite places as we enjoy good authentic Italian food. I took a work colleague there last night and we started the vewing by having a prosciutto wood fired pizza.   Call ahead and make sure Alberto keeps the oven on for you. Not starting your dining experience without sampling one his wood fired pizzas would be sacrilege.  My wife ordered a pasta dish and I went for the Oso Bunco. It's one of the best I have ever had and done to perfection. We enjoyed a wonderful bottle of Barolo and shared a Tartuffo for desert. This is as real as it gets.   The restaurant is owned and operated by Alberto who is from the old country. Next time in Cave Creek make sure to stop by and try it. Tell him Ed @ Anna sent you.

I've been to this restaurant several times in the past and thought the food and the service was much better. This time it was a dismal experience on all fronts. It took 90 minutes to get a table of 7 fully served. Was really the worst experience I have had at any restaurant in a while. The food was okay and I've had better here in the past.  Sam, if you're listening, I think you've taken your eye off the fries brother. Stop opening so many places and focus on what made you great..Great experience, great food, great value. The Greene House needs to go back to the basics.

Been to Padres twice now and I have enjoyed both times. Last time I went I took a colleague from work and we sat at the Bar. They have a really cute bartender who was super nice. My first time there I had the lazy enchilada's and wasn't overly impressed. The sauce was too mild for my liking. My wife had the carne adovada and I was a ready and willing to help her finish what she couldn't eat.   The last time I was there with my work colleague we shared some appetizers: the bacon wrapped scallops and the lobster quesadilla. Both were really stellar. To help wash this down we had some patron margaritas which I found to be very good. I wonder if they make their mix their as it was just right.  We ordered and both of us got burritos. I have to tell you that no matter what your political affiliation I strongly recommend the Obama burrito-yum. I also find their fried ice cream to the best around.  I enjoy the bar area and would recommend this place. If you're looking for hole in the wall sonoran style Mexican food this is not your place. The menu is diverse and borders on eclectic but not as eclectic as Barrio café. Definitely worth a stop, and Padres has been added to my Mexican-Latin rotation. The only improvement would be the chips. If they could make these to order it would be perfect.

Went back a few ago and it was awesome. try the chicken nachos. Never really enthralled with chicken on my nachos but our waitress talked it up and I'm glad we got them..also a great deal during happy hour.  Still serving some awesome margs. I stick with the Obama burrito and my wife loves the lobster quesi we never really vary out that zone.

The Mission: It's not Mexican, its Latin, related to be sure but also entirely different.  The Mission is located in Old Town Scottsdale, and is situated between the old Spanish style church and the black smith shop for you old school Scottsdale folk. If you're looking for a great place to take out of towners for some refined Latin style cooking, and a taste of Old Town Scottsdale this restaurant really can't be beat.  It's one of the few places that still do fresh Guacamole tableside that you can have mild, spicy or hot. I recommend the hot, as it's how I prepare my Guac at home. Mike the bartender is quickly gaining a following as a specialist in "spicy" margaritas, but make no mistake Mike is a true mixologist and takes his craft very seriously. Mike will usually have two frozen margaritas on tap at any given time and one version will usually be spicy. I've had the habanero, pear & ginger (yes that's right), watermelon and the spicy mango. All are awesome. Ask for a sample. Mike also has other cocktails and non frozen margs always on hand.  The chips and salsa are done in house the salsa is great and has a wonderful smokiness to it. If you want some additional dimension to your chips and salsa ask for the additional salsas that usually have on hand for the asking. It's worth asking for it as they are wonderfully prepared and add another flavor depth to your culinary experience.  However you will need ask specially for the ghost chilies salsa, and its hot, hot stuff comprade so please be careful. In India they use ghost chilies to keep elephants away if you catch my drift.   I really love the Sunday afternoon pork taco all you can eat special. They roast a couple of pigs on property and serve until the pig is gone. The pork shoulder and the carnitas will rock your world with fresh made little corn tortillas. Its "Delicioso" as Jimmy Dean would say. You can also order the pork as entrees if you're not there Sunday or just want an entrée; however the pork shoulder can't be beat as it explodes off the bone.   I had the Almegas Al Vapor which is Peruvian seafood soup. This blew me away and wonderfully balanced with a light creamy broth and very unique flavors. The soup is not over powered by the seafood and the whole bowl is nicely done and makes for a great tasting dish just to expand your culinary diversity. The other side order I have to recommend is the street corn. The corn is sweet, wonderfully spiced and makes for a wonderful addition to any meal.  While I haven't had them I hear the sweet potato fries are pretty stellar as well.  Two desserts that can't be missed are the pumpkin bread pudding and the espresso churros. The pumpkin bread pudding is made from scratch down to the caramel sauce. It's great even if you don't like bread pudding, try it. The other desert I really liked is the espresso churros with little chocolate milkshakes. It's a great dish for out of towners that may be a little reserved with food that they are not normally accustomed to.  The Mission is a small restaurant, so make sure to book reservations during the high season and most of all enjoy la dolce far niente.

My wife and I we're at Spphire Mrtini down the street and decided to go for dinner. We went to Oean Prime on a lark. We wound up sitting in the bar which was very comfortable and they serve the full menu.   Te bar had great ambiance with some good guitar and even people dancing at some point in the evening. We started off by ordering some cocktails. My wife had the Berry and Bbbles and I had the Mojitowhich had some berry action as well. The cocktails we're superb.   Our server Carrie was a doll and very attentive without being intrusive. We started off with the seafood tower. The quality of the oysters we're by far the best and the lobster was okay. In the future I would just order the oysters.   We also shared an order of the sweet Chili calamari which was excellent and I strongly recommend it.   For dinner I had the bone in fillet, and my wife had the Australian lobster tail. My steak was cooked to perfection and a light to eat. We also orderedhe jalapeno gratin potatoes and the truffle mac & cheese. The truffle mac and cheese was great. The Au gratin potatoes need more flavoring for my book.   Desert was equally delightful and we sampled the key lime pie and the sorbets.   All in all a great date night for any couple with a casual feeling. The design of the restaurant is fantastic and you can go wrong for dinner or just drinks. Plenty of flat panel TV's if you want to enjoy a game in the bar as well.

Finally made it to J&G Steak House located in the Phoenician resort in the former Mary Elaine's restaurant. J&G is brought to us by Michelin starred chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten of NYC. Upon arriving we entered the bar and liked what we saw. The bar is a fantastic environment with views overlooking the valley and a high-end modern design. Looking to impress the significant other I would definitely hit the bar. The crowd in this part of the restaurant seemed to be with it, as they were all dressed to the nines; especially the ladies.  But I wasn't there to gawk, I was there to pound some steak. We were quickly seated and a bus person  had some bread on the plates in seconds. That's where it stopped working like perfection. We were hanging out for 20 minutes before the waiter even approached the table. True to form with the rep Jean-Georges NYC restaurant of lousy service I might add. The service really didn't get much better from that point on. After placing the drink order we were waiting another 10-15 min before the first cocktail even arrived. I don't want to be rushed, but for god sakes get me a drink.  We finally ordered about an hour after being seated. My wife and I shared a Raw bar appetizer for two and a Caesar salad. The appetizer was very good and full of fresh fish and they did not skimp on the lobster. We were very pleased at this and looked at the price of $32/person as not being too bad for this type of place with the amount of lobster you get plus oysters etc. Next came the Caesar salad which was okay. They use the heart of romaine so it's a little pale in comparison to most Caesar preparations but not bad, just not something you're going to say "wow, what a great Caesar salad".  My wife ordered the pepper steak and I grabbed the 12oz Filet. We ordered a few sides as we always like to sample, and take home what we don't eat. We decided to try the mac and cheese, the steak fries, and the creamed spinach.  The meal arrived and we dug in. I have to say the filet was cooked to perfection. I would have like a little more crust on the steak but as far as steaks go it was nicely done,  and lived up to the rep of the owner. My wife also liked her pepper steak. They serve some very interesting sauces with the steaks so make sure to try all.  Unfortunately the sides were a big letdown. The mac & cheese was just a cut above Kraft. Nothing special, just cheese and mac. The creamed spinach had a unique taste but nothing special here either. I always hold creamed spinach up to the impossible to reach standard of Strip Steak in NYC and this version failed miserably. The fries were not bad. We had asked for them well done and they were great. Next was dessert. I ordered the sorbet and my wife ordered the raspberry soup. We both thoroughly enjoyed the dessert.   In retrospect the restaurant really needs to step up its service if it's going to hold its own with the likes of Mastros. Mastros has nothing to worry about in regards to J&G. The steak was superbly done, but the service and mediocre sides bring this hyped-up restaurant down in my book. If they had a 2.5 star I would give it that, but I will be forced to give it two even though the steak was great..

Uncle Louie's is the classic local bar and eatery. The restaurant services up excellent and pasta and pizza dishes and pours a strong drink. We usually sit at the bar and enjoy the game and always happy to see Louie and Marie.  For Phoenix the Italian food is great and you won't be disappointed. My wife sticks with the pasts which she loves and I usually go for the pizza. You won't be disappointed. The staff is young and the restaurant is new so that may be some of reasons for peoples comments on the service, but these are areas that will be worked out in time. Don't let it stop you from coming.  Its in North Scottsdale (I do mean North) so things die down at 9pm. if you coming oast that call and make sure their open.

I came across an article on Gallo Blanco and was intrigued by the write up that I wanted to go and try it. The chef is Doug Robson who was born in Mexico, and came to local fame as the original chef at La Grande Orange.   On a note of whimsy my wife and I decided to make the long haul from the North Desert Mountains down to that resurging downtown Phoenix area. Of course I'm always skeptical on the idea that down Phoenix is turning into a real downtown where people are on the streets after 5pm. However; one has to be careful using this measure as a sign that turnaround is happening as no one is on the streets on a hot September night.  Upon arriving at the address the navigation system lead us to, I recall thinking "this just doesn't look good". The building was one of those nondescript 8 story 1970's building with a  "Clarendon Hotel" sign and in another boxy red sign "Gallo Blanco". At the door to the Clarendon was a glowing orb that was reminiscent of something Spock may have had in his bedroom during "Pon Farr".  Summoning up the courage of the force, we got out and ventured into this quirky environment and I'm glad that we did. We entered through the hotel and the restaurant literally runs into the lobby although they are two very distinct and non related businesses. The restaurant itself reminded me of the scene in Seattle in the early 90's. It was youthful with a funky vibe going on and had Chicano art dotting the walls.   We decided to sit in the bar as it seemed to have a lively scene going on. Our waitress was a very hip and cool gal, from of all places, New Jersey by way of Colorado. My wide ordered the White Sangria and I asked our waitress what she recommended. When she said that they fresh squeeze all their juices, I immediately ordered a margarita. You used to be able to find a good margarita in this town, but now all you find is syrupy pre mixed crap. Well this, my friends, was a great and fabulously refreshing margarita. You just can't go wrong with fresh squeezed lime juice.  After tasting the margarita I noticed that they also had Augua Fresca's and I had a feeling these would be good as well. We ordered the Honey Dew fresca and Wow, what a refreshing drink and not to sweet. We ordered some appetizers, as we like to sample a lot of different flavors at new restaurant. We started with the guacamole.   They charge for chips and salsa but if you order the guac they bring chips and salsa. The guac was very good, but the chips left a little on the table. Of course I am a chip snob and only fresh made chips piping hot ever perk my interest. I found these a little flat. The salsas were okay with the tomatillo being good and the red salsa being a little spicy but nothing stellar. They were also served in squeeze bottles. Guess the economy has impacted everyone.  We decided to order one more app which was the "Chicarron de Queso", or for the laymen: "Fried Cheese". While this has nothing to do with Chicahrrones its fried Manchengo cheese and is really good, but extremely rich, which our waitress  did warn us about.  After that we each ordered the entire line up of Tacos (steak, pork, fish, vegetable, and shrimp). They are served street style with little fresh made corn tortillas.   The fish tacos were made with Alaskan Halibut and were delicious. The steak tacos had a wonderful flavor and the pork tacos created a "tacos al pastor" simulation that was devine with a fresh bit of pineapple to sweeten things up.  The shrimp taco didn't disappoint, and the vegetable tacos were the surprise of the night with a wonderful fresh and inviting flavor. We also ordered a Mexican ear of street corn. This is grilled and rolled in some mayo and Cojita cheese..yum yum yum.  At this point we were just too full for desert. The food has a wonderful freshness to it and I would definitely go back again. We have heard that the "Chilaquiles Verdes" are really good as well.  Dress casual, adopt an easy going attitude, and leave all pretense at home and you will have a wonderful dining experience here. It does give one hope that central Phoenix may indeed be making a small comeback after all.
