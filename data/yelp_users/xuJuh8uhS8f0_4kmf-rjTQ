I have loved this place since I first started coming here in 2008. Definitely the best Thai I have had in town and I will travel from the north valley for this  restaurant. Everyone I have taken here loves it. Pad Thai is delicious with chicken and shrimp. Curries are divine. Hubby loves their beef dishes. Soups are amazing. Love the corn fritters appetizer. Definitely a treat and different. Have not had a dish here that I did not like. Mango cheesecake is a must. Love this place. The outdoor seating is precious even though smack dab in central phx

This place was so dingy.  The skates looked disgusting like someone or something had been chewing on them.  The facility really needs an uplift.  The ice was really choppy too. Almost could not find the location and no parking at the front of venue, only on the side or back. This was just weird since the place is in large shopping center.

Very authentic yoga. It's so nice to not just rush through different positions like some other studios. Feel such a connection here and leave class spiritually and physically refreshed. So happy this place is so close to my home. The studio is a little stinky though. Wish the rooms opened up to outside for airflow. Not sure what a solution is because people have allergies so can't just throw on some incense or essential oils. Worth it though. This does not ever stop me from coming and is really only an issue when going to a class late in the evening.

Love this place. The sauce has a sweet taste and a little different from the norm. They have pretty good salads but let's face it. You come here for the carbs. Love their pizza and also the spaghetti with homemade meatballs. Such great service consistently. My husband and I love to come here and definitely do at least once a week. Also, the Apple serenata is life. Enjoy it!

Having a hubby that knows cars I am not usually tricked when I go to get work done on it even though they try so hard. The guys at Network Alignment were not like this. Really honest people. Assessed my current alignment and told me it's not horrible but not factory specs. I knew it was causing my tires to wear faster so I went ahead with the alignment. I will faithfully take my car here because of their honesty and fair prices.

I shouldn't be eating cupcakes with my summer ab plan. However these cakes are delicious! Always so fresh and light. I typically don't care for icing but I savor the icing on these cupcakes. If I am going to splurge on a treat there are few places I will go to and this place is one of them.

My husband and I love this restaurant. We are addicted to their cheese bread that comes with the meal. It is perfect and often it is what brings us to this restaurant...just thinking about that bread makes me salivate now as I type this.  Service is pretty good here. The food is not spectacular, but consistent and the bread is amazing. Really good deal for the prices as well. My favorite dish here is the broccolli and chicken pasta dish.

The family that owns this place are the sweetest. I usually stop here in the morning to grab a chai drink. So close to work. They have a good chicken noodle soup and the bagels are delicious. I just took off one star because I don't like the quality of ingredients in their breakfast sandwiches.

Really enjoy this place. Actually forgot about it for a while and then remembered how awesome it is and went back again last night. Red jade chicken is great. Like to get half in quesadilla form and the rest with the beans and rice. Love the jerk fried rice. Portions are huge. The snickerdoodle cookie given with the meal makes my day. A great place to grab food to go in north Phoenix.

This place used to be a good spot for breakfast/brunch about a year ago.  My fiancee and I would go almost every weekend.  However, the service started to decrease and honestly the food is not that great to make one want to continue going if the service is awful.  The waitresses are great.  However, to get a seat at this place you apparently need to be elderly.  We kept watching people get seated who arrived after us when finally we spoke to Tom the host, Tom said it would be a few minutes.  The wait continued for another fifteen minutes.  Finally we go inside and see an elderly couple come in.  Tom obviously knew these people, asked how their trip was and wrote their names on the 2nd page of lists.  Another younger guy was waiting and Tom puts his name on page 4 or 5 of the list.  After witnessing this we decided to spend our money elsewhere.  Oldies, this place is for you because Tom will pay preference.  If you are young, you apparently need to call ahead or wait until all of the oldies are seated and served.

I know this place is a chain restaurant and I usually avoid those but damn the food is too good to resist. We always receive fabulous service at this location even when the place is packed. Management is good about actually having adequate amounts of servers at all times. We have been here for many lunches and dinners. They are wonderful at either time. The lunch specials do make this place more affordable for all.  Whatever time you come just know it will be worth it.

If I could give them zero stars I would. I have never been so frustrated trying to reason and understand a place's policies. I called in to order a chicken shawerma sandwich with no pita. Essentially all of the things inside just no pita. I am currently grain free and feel a lot better without them. No substititions asked for or anything special. Just give me what is inside the sandwich without the bread for the same price. The response: we don't do that. Those containers are only for people who dine in. So I asked "If I ate a meal in and had food leftover you would give me that container but I can't receive it for a to go order?" To which the reply was yes and the employee attempted to convince me to order the plate meal and would not take my original order. The worst customer service. I will never eat there again.

I love this place. I love their fresh and fabulous salads and also their pastas. Have not tried the pizza but my husband really enjoys them. The heart healthy salad is one of my favorites. Their teas are also delicious. Always great service and have never been disappointed with the food at this location.

Love this place! Consistently amazing food and great service. ALL of the servers are amazing. My hubby and I love coming here for lunch.   The food is always amazing, freshly made, and great ingredients. This is a place where I can feel full from the food but not gross. Some of my favorites are: - jerk chicken hoagie (with bacon - takes it to another level of goodness) - avocado hoagie  - funky q pizza - enlightened spinach salad  Can't beat the prices of those hoagies, and especially can't beat the lunch specials ($5).

The quality of ingredients makes the difference here. Love their bacon egg and cheese croissant. I love that they sell Martinelli's Apple juice, which is one of the best unless you are making your own fresh Apple juice. I took off one star because they don't consistently open on time. They are supposed to open at 7am and one day at 7:15 it still was not open. This was not a fluke. Happened several times. I stopped going for a while because of this. However the sandwiches are so good that I have returned, just not as frequently. My review is based on breakfast. Never been for lunch.

The hubby and wife who run this place are most adorable and the food is delicious. The highlight for me here is the hummus. I am obsessed with it and actually will order the appetizer and then get some to go for the week. I won't get hummus from the grocery store anymore. So delicious. Their pita sandwiches are pretty good as well as the plates.

Service is not always great here but the food is consistently delicious. Love the veggie burger. Fresh made sauces and all organic make this place good for your body as well. Best time to go is for lunch. Service sadly decreases at dinner.

Happy hour here is one word: GLORIOUS!  The $5 wine and their gimlet make me smile. The spinach artichoke dip is way too delicious to be fair. Although my thighs say no, I can not avoid that dip. The nutella cheesecake completely rocks my world and brings me joy. The place is deceiving from the outside as it is tiny and in the parking lot of a strip mall. However, don't be deceived. Relax on the patio and enjoy all that 32 Shea has to offer.

I love this place so much. Serving sizes are perfect. Not too much that I feel disgusting but enough to be full.  Burgers are delicious! Yummy seasoned fries. The milkshakes are also amazing even though I can not often indulge. Yum yum

I had the worst waxing experience of my life at this salon.  I used to go to Jessica here but over the summer she stopped working there. When I returned back in town I went to get underarms and upper lip waxed. It was the most painful waxing I have ever had. I tried to explain how to put pressure after the removal to help but the woman I had did not know what she was doing at all. My underarms were in pain for several hours after getting waxed there. This never happened in the past 10 years that I have been getting waxed. Additionally, my face broke out due to the upper lip waxing being done incorrectly. I will never return here again and I warn all others to only go here if you have your one steady person that you can count on that works there and knows how to wax properly.

In my struggle to find decent Indian food in the north valley, this place is the best up here. Trust, I have tried many. The flavor profile is right. Service is pretty good and it's all vegetarian. I usually get the mutter pander, this is my favorite dish. It's delicious here. Also love their gulag jamun. Yum yum. The servings are great and I always have enough for leftovers.

I like this place and it is sad they are closing. Came here last week and tried it out. They have free shoe rental. The class is difficult and a great workout. It was hard but fun since dancing the entire time. The classes are only 45 minutes so it's perfect timing.

Thank you for being off the strip but neighborhood was a little sketch. Food here was above average but not superb.

This place is somewhere that I will not return. After seeing reviews here, I thought that going to this restaurant for the lunch buffet was a good idea. However, a good portion of the food was not palatable.   Dishes that were okay: - the rice - chicken biryani (cold but flavorful) - chicken tikka masala (some of this chicken was very overcooked, but at least palatable) - naan - gulab jabun (like a donut hole - delicious)  Dishes that were not decent: - appetizer (some donut looking thing) - paneer mutter masala (this is usually one of my favorite dishes, but was disgusting!) - fish (I don't know why I tried fish at a buffet, but not impressed) - curry chicken  I thought just the service would be bad, and it was. I was expecting that. Did not get a refill.  This was somewhat expected with the comments on here that I read before choosing this restaurant. I can totally accept poor service if the food tastes good.   Overall, I paid 14.09 for this meal, and did not even eat a full plate because unfortunately on the two plates I did have, not everything was worthy of being put into my body as it would taste so bad going down. I have been eating Indian food for over 10 years. I love it and this was such a sad food experience. After spending the past summer in Berkeley and thoroughly enjoying all of the fabulous Indian restaurants there, it is so disappointing that it so extremely difficult to find a decent Indian restaurant in the north Valley. The last time I enjoyed Indian food in Phoenix area was when I went to Tempe but that is too long of a journey from where I live now. The struggle to find decent Indian food in the North Valley continues, but I know that I will definitely not be going back to this place.

As someone who does not like to work out but trying to get my body together, Karve is perfect for me. I was never motivated with the gym. I took dance classes consistently growing up and loved the results they brought. I had great form and my body was in shape, and plus dancing is fun.   Karve brings the focus of ballet from your past with being in perfect form and alignment in your mind throughout the workout. When you do things correctly you get great results.  Beyond knowing that being consistent with this will show results rather quickly, all of the women at this studio are so kind and welcoming. Additionally, the instructors are also motivating and fun.  Even in pain from the workout you will find yourself laughing at some joke they have made. Additionally, they now have Zumba as well to add cardio to your workout regimen. This is such a fun class and one that for me does not have all of the focus that is necessary during a Karve class.   Even though I am sore today from the 9am class I will definitely be back tomorrow to feel the burn, smile, and laugh with the next workout. Love it!

Loved the food here! For once I was able to eat BBQ and not go into a food coma feeling disgusting with myself from heavy foods. This place has all non-hormone meat and local/organic produce. The food is not so heavy either. For instance the cole slaw has grape seed oil and kale in it instead of only cabbage, mayonnaise and other fatty ingredients. The slaw was light and refreshing. The BBQ beans had some black beans in there and the mac and cheese was not overloaded. Good quality ingredients gave a delicious meal that actually gave me energy instead of slowing me down. Yum!

Had a great class on a Saturday. A fun way to burn many many calories.  I was warmly greeted by Rachel and hubby as soon as I came in the door. The other clients were also welcoming and noticed it was my first time, offering assistance. The decor, music, equipment was perfect. This class was challenging but fun and I left smiling. Thank you RPM spin. I will be back for more.

So delicious! We had great service here and the food was quite amazing. I had the coconut curry soup and the lemongrass and ginger in it made for a very delicious and healing soup. I was having sinus issues when we went to eat here. My hubby loved his food as well and he is a picky one. We will be back.

This place is causing my demise. I had this great ab plan but then I stopped into Bosa Donuts and got 1 dozen donut holes. It's just a dollar and they were just donut holes, so not as bad as a regular sized donut? Right? The donut holes are addicting. Love them. This is my new problem - driving by Bosa Donuts without stopping for donut holes. They lost a star because they don't always have them. Sometimes they run out really early in the day - like noon - and won't make more.

Just finished a 90 minute massage with Matt and it was glorious. I have sensitive skin so I brought my own oil for him to use but it was such a lovely surprise to find that he uses coconut oil during the massage. I feel great and he worked out all of the kinks in my neck and back. This was a therapeutic massage that really focused on my trouble areas. Loved it and I'll be back :)
