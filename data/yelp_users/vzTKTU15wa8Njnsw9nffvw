A great local business that shows independent and classic films. A wine and beer bar with local selections that you can enjoy while watching films. My favorite is Four Peaks peach ale.  Film bar is also a great night spot on weekends. Eclectic DJs spin salsa, Bollywood, 60s soul and everything in between. I love introducing this spot to my friends and you will too!

This is a great neighborhood spot! Their bread is from Wild Flower A local bakery that delivers it fresh every morning. Everyone of their sandwiches comes in a delicious pocket. The Coco loco is a great after sandwich treat. It is like a mounds in a pocket. If you haven't gone you are missing out on this downtown Phoenix gem!

The decor alone put this place on my top restaurants list. The Edison light bulbs really class up this joint. We had great service, our server was attentive and gave great recommendations.   We did the tastings for two menu and were pleased. The house sliders were delicious and featured a quail egg on top. We each got a drink to accompany our meals, Papago Orange blossom is a light fruity beer with a smooth finish and an Odell IPA with subtle hop flavor.  The chicken dumplings and the fish and chips are tasty. I recommend both dishes.   We finished of our meal with a chocolate layer cake and mint chocolate chip ice cream that was a Sharon portion. Already  I plan on returning!

If I could give zero stars I would. I went to Jacksons to redeem a car detail I had previously purchased when it was still Danny's. I called ahead to try to schedule an appointment and was told it was a first come first serve basis.   When I to Jacksons I was up sold a package and was promised  if I wasn't happy I would be accommodated and it would take about three hours. I was hesitant and should not have agreed. Two hours after waiting I when to get lunch. I couldn't find my debt card but luckily I had cash. I ate quickly and went back to Jacksons.   I told the girl at the cashiers station my situation and it appeared they had not started the additional services and if we could cancel it. She tried to reach the detailers via radio and they did not answer. She went outside and I thought she went to talk to the detailers but she got on her cellphone. 15 minutes later she came back in I again asked if we could cancel the additional service. She stated she would have to get her manager.    Her manager tried to place the blame on me for waiting so long and I quote said " I am not trying to be an asshole but we did the service and you need to pay." I again explained the situation and I did my due diligence to stop it as soon as I learned my card was missing. Mind you they were not done with the service. The manager then promised he would personally look over the car to make sure it was done right.   Ten minutes later the detailers were done with the additional service. I was called again to the cashier to pay. I asked the cashier did the manager check the car to make sure it was done as he promise and he hadn't. After he inspected the car I had to wait an additional 15 minutes due. I ended up having to write a check and planned to return to pay when I found my card or could get cash. I returned the following week and they lost my check.    This is the worse customers service I have ever had. I left feeling frustrated and taken advantage of. Stay away!!!!

Valley bar gives you the feeling you are in a New York Venue but the Arizona themed drink menu reminds you otherwise. This new basement venue has that freshly cut wood smell and excellent decor. With two rooms, the lounge and the performance area.    We tried the lounge first and found a comfy booth to relax and sip our drinks till performance time. I ordered a Kate & Rueben, the drink was refreshing, a decent size and not overly priced.  I loved the variety of latin music playing which ranged from Salsa to Spanish Rock and Cumbia to Mambo. The lounge has a gaming area with darts, pin ball machines and a  game that resembled table bowling.  After finished our drinks we went to the performance area, note to all no glass in that area. I liked the how raw and intimate the room was. We went on opening night to see LA Orkesta formerly know as Sergio Mendoza and the Orkesta. It was a great way to kick off the opening of this venue  and I know I will be returning! I can't wait to see how this place evovles!
