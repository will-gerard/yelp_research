Came here for a weekend stay and I was not impressed, especially given it belongs to the Starwood chain.  The rooms were very small and you have absolutely NO privacy when using the bathroom.  The view overlooking the Zen garden was nice during the day, but at night you are subjected to the screeching of various drunks walking from the club back to their rooms.  A previous yelper mentioned attractive crowds...maybe if you are in your 40's looking to relive your 20's. However, for myself and my girlfriends (who are all in our mid-20's), we were not impressed.  Ladies, please realize when a two piece is no longer the best for your body, and men, the Dad bod will never be in.  All in all I would never stay here again. Only perk was being within walking distance of bars and clubs so we didn't have to worry about getting a cab.

Hands down the best ice cream shop I've been to! They have tons of unique ice cream flavors, soft macarons and top off your creation with a toasted marshmallow. The guy who helped us out (I forgot to get his name) was super friendly and more than happy to let us try any flavor we wanted. My husband and I will definitely be making this our regular dessert place.
