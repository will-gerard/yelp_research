Been here once. Got the Italian special & the European sub. Both were really good! I tried both & couldn't decode which one I liked better lol. The sandwiches are actually 2 sandwiches when you order the full sandwich so you get huge portions! Not bad at all for $7 & change. Lots of other European goodies that I had never seen. Sweets too. I tried the kinder country chocolate bar. The girl at the counter said it was Germany's most popular candy. I can tell why! Yummy!!!

Everything was bad. From the sticky Spanish rice, to the tap water, to the cold food (that was supposed to be hot), to the service.  Will not go again!

The best clothing alternation biz in north Phoenix by far. Stop in for the friendliest service, best alterations as well as men's suits & women's clothing. Randall, the owner, is always a pleasure to work with.
