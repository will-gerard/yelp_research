you cant really go wrong with pita jungle. There food is always fresh and good no matter what location you are going to. There are very different vibes based on the location though. tempe location is pretty hipster while the gilbert one is great to bring your kids too. I mean that makes sense right. The chandler location is on a lake which is nice for dates. So lets get to the food, and lets start with the hummus. All flavors are delicious. The jalepano cliantro is the best. For lunch sometimes I get the hummus with chicken its a great lunch! There portions are huge any pasta and salad your going to end up taking home. lentil fatoosh salad is AMAZING. I was actually nicknamed "the fatoosh" for a while because it was all I ate for a summer. anywaysssss after that the pasta salad is great! the 1000 beans is good. the lavash wraps are great I mean they are all pretty good. If you can get there for their happy hour its a great deal. small plates or tapas for around $2 a piece and they are great for the after work munchies. Beer selection is not that great though. hope you enjoy this place as much as I do!

I'm sad to see all of the poor ratings for A&P. They are my favorite nursery in Gilbert. Though they are smaller than most nurseries in the valley they are local and very very helpful. And every single plant I have bought from them is flourishing in my yard. If you want help I have always received get advice and tips! Keep up the good work!

Wowzers! This place was great! I have never gone before due to the long lines on the weekend but I happened to have this morning off and me and my husband decided to see what it was all about. We start with your basic coffee which was fine. I was your average joe. Then we both  ordered the breakfast sandwich and shared a side of biscuits and gravy. You cant have breakfast without biscuits and gravy right?? well let me tell those biscuits were MIND-BLOWINGLY good. We have tried almost all the breakfast spots in gilbert and these were by far the best. The breakfast sandwich was really great too. Very fresh tasting. Its a very very small place that is why there is always a line and the table are made for only 2 or 4 people so I wouldnt suggest this place for a large group. Super cute country decor and great pricing for what you get. Oh and the homefries were cooked to perfection. two thumbs up and 5 stars for me. but dont go on the weekend the line is crazy.

Flancers is great! My husband and I go here anytime we are having a craving for a delicious sandwich. We have 2 favorites and give each other the other half of our sandwiches. My favorite is the "its about thyme" chicken sandwich. Chicken, sauteed mushrooms and yummy yummy yummy basil mayo. It will blow your mind. My husbands favorite is the prickly pear sandwich. It has flavor unlike any other. A true AZ original. Its a smaller space so probably not great for large crowds but great for a dinner or lunch date with your friends or family.

Great lunch special with a good amount of food but the quality really isnt there. I have had the chow mein which was ok, the orange chicken was better but still not great. But if you are in a pinch and want cheap chinese this is the place.

Cheap Drinks, Great Atmosphere. When I was in my college years this was the place to be. Now I prefer this place for day drinks in the winter. At night it is pretty hard to find a seat. The food is pretty good too. I have had the hummus which is really good as a healthy bar snack. The fries are the best though! deeeeeelish!

wow this is truly the best pizza place in phx. If you can handle the long wait it is totally worth it. plus while your waiting there is a wine bar attached with great drinks and an english pub directly across from the resturaunt. make the trip you will not regret it!

i dream about their BBQ sauce.  im serious, straight into the viens please! damn, really my mouth is salavating while I am writing this. My favorite here is the baked potato and when im feeling really hungry I will have them top it with pulled pork. My fiance always gets the sampler platter which is a good amount of meat for what you pay for. expect a line everytime but there is always seating. the only downfall is there is no alcohol only soft drinks. It is a Gilbert staple and I recommend to anyone who is on the east side.

I am a FAN! love this place and have for a very long time. My favorites are the BBQ chicken pizza, fontina burger, garlic fries, pesto chicken sandwich and the Sonoran dog. SO good. Great outdoor seating. Beautiful scenery, greattttt for kids. good prices! and you get a free meal on your birthday. I will say try to go before or after typical lunch time on the weekends because the lines can get really long. The area outside is large and great if you have little ones that like to run around. After your meal, I suggest getting a coffee or a cupcake at the coffee shop that is right next door. Then walk around the farm area after. Its a nice escape from the busy world and soak in some quality time with your family. Enjoy yourself! I always do there.

Bergies is hands down the best coffee in Gilbert! Me and my husband are more than regulars. My favorite is there ice coffee and his is the Mocha. They are very friendly and just have this comfy local feel. They support local artist, teach lesson about roasting and really have an honest passion for coffee. The patio is beautiful and so relaxing. I see it as a mini escape from the hustle and bustle of life in a beautiful garden set up. We usually stop by on Saturdays to get our morning joe relax for a bit then head off to the Gilbert Farmers Market. This place is really amazing. I cant say enough good things about it.

The best Chinese you will find in the east valley! Our family orders almost every week. They are always consistent, fast and lots of flavor. Our family loves the combination lo mien, beef and broccoli, crab wonton. My husband loves the dumplings. Everyone's favorite is the sesame chicken. It is amazing! All our friends and family love it as well! Hands down the best!!

Just ok for me. Green Chili is ok, not great. The other mexican food plates are pretty basic. I feel like its missing a little bit of authenticity. Some of my other family members love it.

I normally never give any place a 5 star but this place deserves 10 stars!! It is a sweet hidden gem in the middle of Scottsdale. The service was outstanding, I never had an empty glass and everyone was so friendly. And the food... The food was outstanding. We started with the giao mozzarella so fresh and delicious but so simple. I was scared to have the rabbit gnocchi but I'm so glad I did. This is my new favorite Italian restaurant in the entire valley

This is only of my favorte places to go in gilbert. really yummy food and a great staff! There is not one bad kind of the bruschetta! My favorite is the prosciutto and fig. mmmmmm so good. They have a great happy hour but it ends at 5 :( but you get mini pitchers (probably 2.5 pints) for 5 dollars and they have a great beer selection. The tomato and moz app is amazing! The only fall back is there is no reservations unless you are in a large party and there is usually a pretty long wait (30 minutes) on the weekend. But if you can handle a little waiting time you will love it.

This is one of our favorite spots for breakfast in Gilbert. The service is always fast and friendly and its great for the kiddos. Our favorite is the Caramelized banana & pecan brioche French toast. IT IS BEYOND Delicious. They make they own jelly/jam and it is quite tasty. The Benedicts are yummy too! The music that they play is top notch and is a generally fun environment for all ages

this was my first experience with the conveyor belt type sushi. The sushi was not good at all. poor quality and tasteless. prices were very cheap which is probably why it was not tasty...

Really good! Shrimp tacos are great but really pricey... Highly recommend going during happy hour. Other wise your paying a lot for a little bit of food.  UPDATING MY REVIEW:  We have gone back a couple of times since this review and me and my husband really enjoy sitting up at the bar, watching a game and munching on that delicious bowl of chips and salsa.  The staff is super friendly and is starting to become one of our favorites downtown. But still we try to only go at happy hour, otherwise its really pricey.

Oh wilderness, we love you so! My husband and I have been patiently waiting for a brewery in Gilbert. and BOOM! here comes the Arizona Wilderness Brewing Co. Always super tasty beers, friendly staff, and the burgers... GOOD GOD those burgers. YummY YummY YummY! Did I mention I love the burgers? Its also a great place to watch a game as well. But come early because this place can get packed. Go order a yummy beer brewed with local ingredients and get burger!

What a fun place! This my friends is an experience. You pick your seafood, they bring it to you in a bag, you tear it apart and eat it. Chuck the rest in the bucket. Its great, really tasty and fun. If your squeamish about tearing apart your food and eyeballs and guts go for something a little on the beginner side. But all in all i would recommend this place to anyone. Its great for kids, loud, and your kids can color on the paper tables. Be sure to get there early because they do get busy.

Really good burgers. I like the Sam burger and my husband usually gets the Kobe burger. Loaded fries are amazing!!! Total gut bomb but worth it! It's a great place for the kiddos but also a great place to grab a beer with friends and watch a game.

Good was ok, a little too fried for me. Can get really pricey if your not at happy hour. But they do have a good happy hour with their oysters. It's probably the only place to get decent oysters downtown.

Didnt love this place. The "design" i got looked like I was a 65 year old woman heading of to vegas with my sequence cardigan... If i could pull that look off i wouldnt mind it butttttttt i cant. Also they convinced me to wax my eyebrows and ended up waxing my WHOLE FACE. which was completely unneccessary and weird. I am by no means a bearded lady so doing all that just made me break out like crazy. If you just going for a basic one color mani or pedi im sure its fine just be careful with the waxing and designs...

Pomo is great! Love the atmosphere, bar area, patio & wait staff. We ordered the Toto Sapore it was good, a little too meaty for me, but my husband liked it. We also ordered the Donna Rosa which was the shrimp pizza. We ordered it because it sounded interesting and it was REALLY GOOD! I have been back a couple other times and always enjoy myself.

Updating my review on Snooze. Previously we have a pretty poor experience. After writing my review the manager asked me if I would try it one more time and we did. Both of my boys are under the age of two so when we bring them its a true test of the restaurant as well as a test of my patience :) Snooze did great! They even catered to our need for special seating. When you have a kid in a high chair and another in a car seat things get tricky when it comes to that. Ramon made sure our experience was excellent and it was thanks to him. I ask the Ham benedict (which is what I got last time) and it was GREAT! the hollandaise was on point and super filling. My husband got the Chillaques Benedict and he LOVED it. like really loved it. I was only allowed one bite. And that one bit was really good. My 2 year son got the pancakes and he loved those as well. The kids meals are actually pretty big. It came with a pancake, hash browns and fruit. which was really great. I had the local iced brew coffee and that was really tasty. not too bitter which some cold brews can be that way. My husband had a mocha which is his staple coffee and liked it as well. We also sampled the gingerbread hot cocoa which was their special for the month and that was seriously good! It tasted like cinnamon toast crunch and the gingerbread man had a baby!! YUM YUM YUM. So im thinking our visit previous to this one today just must have been an off day. Which happens to everyone. Its a busy restaurant and you cant expect perfection which such high volume. I can now say this company takes pride in their staff, customers and food. We will definitely come back, but maybe not at breakfast rush hour on a weekend :) Cheers to you Snooze! And thank you for making our breakfast great today!

Wow, what a awesome spot. Super speakeasy vibe, and great cocktails. Its all under ground so if you're a little claustrophobic this may not be the place for you :) but i loved it. My husband I are big fans of Valley Bar which is an underground/speakeasy-ish bar in downtown phoenix and this is very similar. Its a very hip yet casual and welcoming place. Lighting is low, music is loud and the drinks are tasty. what more could you want? You take stairs to get down to the bar which is guarded by a door man. I felt like i was going to some elite/forbidden place which made me like it even more. The back story of this place is pretty cool too but i wont ruin it for you. I have been hoping downtown chandler would start to bring in some new, hip places into the area and this seems like a great step forward for the city. My husband had a whiskey ginger and Bullet was this well whiskey at the time which is pretty impressive. He said it was made just right. You can tell this place take a lot of pride in their cocktails and it shows. But take note, if your not a fan of loud areas you may want to reconsider because this place got really loud at times. Thanks for the yummy cocktails and fun atmosphere.
