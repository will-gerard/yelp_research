I was excited when I found out this place was right down from where I lived, that was short lived.  I ordered the Italian Beef.  I know there are a couple of places that make you pay extra for sweet peppers and giardiniera, so this didn't upset me too much, but the attitude of the cashier did and the fact that I paid the extra and did not get them did.  I got my food to go so I didn't realize the missing peppers until I got home. Also, it was the driest Italian beef I have ever eaten.  With other places nearby that you can get a really good Italian Beef sandwich, that cost a lot less, I'm not sure why this place always seems to be busy.      Now in their defense, I never complained about the mistake, so they never got the chance to fix it..  Also, maybe the cashier was having a bad day, it happens.  The overall experience has kept me from going back. Other friends have told me they don't like their Italian Beef, but that they do have good dogs.

Amazing service!! Bartender was hilarious, she was extremely  busy but managed to always have my drink full. I came in after a bad day at work and am having a blast. Looks like they have a Texas hold em game going.  Will definitely be making this a regular spot. Wonderful deep fried mushrooms. I have to come back when I am hungry to try the rest! !

The people here are absolutely wonderful. When my Siamese had to have surgery they knew I was very worried. They sent me a text every hour to let me know how she was doing and even sent me pictures of her. They went out of their way to make sure both Wasabi and I were comfortable and then continued to check on us after we went home. They really showed they cared.

I have now ordered food from them twice through Grubhub. The first time we ordered two build your own pasta dishes.  After waiting a long time we called and a very friendly woman told us there had been a mistake, the food arrived while I was still on the phone with her.  I was ready to be angry and expected the food to be wrong and cold, but it was perfect.  The plates were enough to feed four people.       We decided to try them again and this time we got their hamburger and Italian Beef sandwich.  It took an hour to get here, but again the food was hot and really good.  I was happy that they put the au jus  for my sandwich on the side and that they gave me enough. I think we will use them on a regular basis, but now know that we need to order the food a little early.  It really is worth the wait though.       After a third time of ordering from them, I have to say they are awesome.  I absolutely love their Italian beef sandwich.  I appreciate the fact that they don't charge extra to get sweet peppers and giardiniera.

I can not get over how friendly and helpful the gentleman who helped me was. I have a cat with special nutritional needs and walked into the store unsure of what I needed, he was nice enough to explain all the different brands that they had and gave me some amazing advice.  I am so glad I found this place.  I hate shopping, but I actually left the store in a great mood!  I wish every place was like this. I will be telling all my friends with furbabies to go and check this place out.

The service was friendly and fast. I was in a hurry and ordered my food Togo. I was able to order and head out within 10 minutes. I ordered the Gyro Combo, which was amazing. Tons of meat and fresh veggies. I think I just found my new regular lunch spot. I can see them becoming like Chicago Hamburger Company at lunch with lines out the door and many happy faces.

I have been here several times on a Saturday night and it keeps getting better!  I am shocked by the comments about the bartenders, because I have always found them to be beyond friendly and quick with a drink. They keep the bar clean and always have someone running around the floor to pick up empty glasses and make sure everyone is having a fun time. The prices are great and the drinks strong.  I wish they would change the door on the women's bathroom, but other than that I really like this place.
