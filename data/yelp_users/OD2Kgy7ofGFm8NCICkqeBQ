The worst thing about this place is that it's so far from my house.  Definitely my favorite Chinese place in the valley so far.  Reasonably priced, friendly people, excellent food with which they are very generous.  The orange chicken here is very good and very.. orangey.  It's one of those hole in the wall places that you wander in to by chance.  Really small place with only three or four tables.  So good that at least three people I know started delivering for them just so they could score a free meal every now and then.

Almost all of my shopping is done here.  They have "double ad day" on Wednesdays, where last week's sales overlap with the current sales.   Their prices are very reasonable to begin with.  Much cheaper than Whole Foods and even Trader Joe's, which I never go to any more.  The produce section here is great, everything is always fresh.  They even have bulk salad and baby spinach.  Speaking of bulk, they have a very wide selection including granolas, nuts, candy, snacks, dried fruit, etc.  They also have a good selection of meat, including bison.  At the store in Albuquerque they even had ostrich meat in the freezer, but I haven't looked for it here.  Depending on your habits, this may or may not be one stop shopping.  If you're really dedicated to your Crest toothpaste and Fritos, you should go elsewhere.  Chances are they have what you need, but with less synthetic ingredients.  By the way, I think "Seventh Generation" is a really terrible name for toilet paper.  I've only had one bad experience here.  I went on a Tuesday and they were out of literally about a third of what I needed.  Some of the bread was getting moldy and the produce was looking rather.. saggy.  I'll stick with Wednesdays.

Love this place!  It's a little expensive for me to eat regularly (I'm a cheapass), but I have yet to regret it.  The pizza and wings are great.  I recently had a calzone from there and it was delicious!   Decent delivery time and they have regular specials.  The establishment itself is decent.  I've been in there once or twice and it was uncomfortably busy, not to mention packed with indie hipster emo kids or whatever they're calling themselves now.

Dang! Stopped here quite randomly to grab some lunch and it was delicious. I had a carne asada torta and will definitely be back to check out the rest of the menu.

More than once I've found myself driving fifteen minutes out of my way just to eat here.  Their food is consistently delicious and generously portioned.  The place is clean (usually the opposite is true for good Chinese places) and they have a large fish take, as every respectable Asian establishment should.  Friendly family owned place and the people there speak English (??!!?),  Brilliant.  I would highly recommend the soup here.  Mmmm, hot and sour..  And it's cheap!  For about $20 you can get a big portion of whatever main dish, rice, fried wontons, an eggroll (the combo), an order of crab rangoon (they call them crab angels and they are AMAZING), and a large thingy of soup.  You can get your food as a combo, rice bowl, or a la carte.  And it's quick!  And conveniently located amongst the strip clubs and pawn shops of south Scottsdale.  Did I mention they deliver... for free?

I'm a frequent patron of T's.  They have been a constant drain on my income since I was 18 and lived across the street.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff that has been around for a few years.  They know what I like (whatever's cheap) and usually tell me what their specials are as soon as I come in.  There's also a good selection of beer for when I have a few extra dollars to spend on something fancy.

Oh, Gus's.  For the past 2 1/2 years I've lived within a couple miles of this place, so it's near inevitable that I eat here occasionally.  And honestly, it was okay the first couple times.  Except I finally had to ask them to please put the onions on my pizza BEFORE cooking it, and they grudgingly obliged.  The pizza tastes okay - sometimes.  They will bring you food at 3am when you are too drunk to get it yourself.  And there you have the nicest things I can think of to say about this place.  Service is always slow and sometimes bordering on curt.  Even if you go in to the drab establishment, it can sometimes take ten or more minutes to get a single slice.  Their pizza drips grease and will soak through the box.  The wings are mediocre.  I only eat here if it's 2am and my neighbor wants pizza.  Even then I can only handle one slice.

For some reason, every time I am craving ravioli and am willing to trek the massive two miles over here, it's a damn Sunday and this place is closed.  Ah well.  Everything I've eaten here has been delicious.  Pizza, calzones, sandwiches, ravioli, salad.. it's a real winner.  Another small, locally owned establishment that will have my business for as long as we're both around.

I'm going to go ahead and put it out there that I didn't even venture into the actual restaurant portion of this establishment, but rather camped out in the bar for happy hour.   So, consider this a happy hour/appetizer review, if you like.  They tried really, really hard to make this place feel festive, but succeeded only in making it look like a junkyard full of angry fruit salad.  If you're unfamiliar with that term, head on over to Urban Dictionary.  Go on.  I'll wait.  Are we all together again?  Good.  Let us proceed.  This place sucks.  Not even the free all-you-can-eat appetizers could keep me in here, and I am one cheap bastard.  The only thing they had going for them was the $2 Dos Equis during happy hour.   The appetizer selection was pretty shakey.  There were these things that I think were supposed to be beef enchiladas, a potato concoction, and chips and salsa.  The incognito enchiladas were... stretchy.. and bland.. and the potato thing was about the same, sans the stretchiness.  And how do you fuck up chips?  Seriously?  To top it off, the bartender was slow as shit.  I'll say one.. okay, two good things.  The happy hour is a good deal if you can stomach the food.  They also have a pretty neat lobster claw game where you can "win" a live lobster.  Might be worth going in there just to check it out.

Great little family owned place.  A good portion of the client√®le is actually Middle Eastern, so they've got to be doing something right.  The owner, Mike, is always around and very friendly, and usually hanging out in the market part of the building.  There's a hookah bar upstairs, but having an aversion to hookah, I've never ventured in.   The market is neat to look around in and a good place to go for some excellent fresh feta cheese or lamb.  On to the food.. it is fantastic and inexpensive.  You can get a falafel sandwich and fries for under $5, but that's about the cheapest meal on the menu.  The have a lunch buffet Monday - Friday from 11-3 for $10.  It's a very small buffet and at least half of it is cold food like salads and hummus.  About 75% of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating, but I always enjoy it.  As an added bonus, the last time I was there the guy who refilled my water was wearing one of those t-shirts with kittens on it.. their faces on the front, and their butts on the back.  I don't know if he was serious or not, but it was pretty amazing.

After all the hype about Long Wong's and The Most Amazing Wings, Like, Ever, this place was a sore disappointment.  I went for happy hour as they were advertising 2-for-1 appetizers, and I'd been craving some fried shrimp, only to discover that the 2-for-1 applied only to one particular menu item.  It was early when we got there, and the place was nearly empty.  We sat at a table for about ten minutes waiting for the bartender/waitress to take our order, but this never happened, and it certainly wasn't because we were hiding from her.  We ended up ordering our wings and drinks at the window. The fried shrimp was okay, but over cooked.   Were the wings good?  Sure.  FANTASTIC?  Not even.  The ranch was watered down to the point that it dripped off the wings and the carrot sticks were scrawny, floppy, and dry.  There's no way they had been cut any time in the last two days.  The place is decorated with crap found at Goodwill.  Not usually a bad thing, but is in this case.  There's a tiny stage in one corner, but I won't be back to see who plays it.  To top it off, a family with a gaggle of children came in before we left, and were given menus and served almost immediately.  Overall?  Mediocre bar food, mediocre happy hour prices, poor service and atmosphere.  Meh.

I'm happy to see that something worthwhile has replaced the dismal hole that was Sparky's.  The atmosphere is light and calm, the service is friendly, and the staff seems to enjoy what they do.  When I went, they said they were still perfecting their recipes, which means it should only get even better.  You order at the counter, grab a table, and they bring your food when it's ready.  Soda is self-serve.  I had ramen and spam, and it was my first time with spam.  It was good for what it was, but just not to my taste.  The rest of the soup was pretty good though.  The squid salad ($6 for a decent amount of it) was very good and the squid didn't have that weird rubbery texture it gets when it isn't quite fresh.  I got a mango-almond snow boba and it was amaaziing.  Seriously, try this.  The guy who made it even tried some and was impressed.  Definitely will go back here.  Maybe even later today because it's sounding pretty good right now.

Evermore Nevermore is a new locally owned retail/consignment shop breaking up the monotony in downtown Mesa.  There's a ton of one-of-a-kind alternative-esque.. well, everything.  Art, clothing, jewelry, accessories, collectibles, comic books, Steampunk goodies, zombie survival gear, mostly crafted by Arizonans.  They host a bunch of fun events like the Steampunk jewelry workshop, life drawing, and Crazy Guy Video Nights, and have free sketches by Oddity Commodity on 2nd Fridays.  The staff is friendly and also knowledgeable about what they carry, as it's all hand picked by them.  Probably the best thing ever to happen to Mesa.  If you're into local art and supporting small businesses (and who isn't?) and you haven't been here, you're seriously missing out.
