This place was not the best service.  Our orders came out at different times for a family of 4.  The chicken teriyaki was salty.  The sushi was just ok.  We sat outside and the waitress was very new.  She was kind but knew nothing about the menu and couldn't answer questions.  Way over priced meals.

Great wings!  Pizza is excellent too.  The delivery is fast.   Our family loves eating there.

One of my fav places to eat while downtown.  They have the best salsa and tacos!  I get the burrito bowls almost every time.

Best Pho in town!  We love the combo meat plate as well.  All the meat is so tender and taste amazing.  Don't forget to try the spring rolls too.

This place was so clean and professional.  Derek the owner worked on myself and my husband.  He was very patient and did a fantastic job!  I have been to some dingy places and this is by far top notch!  They are also very reasonable in price.  We will be back for more work soon!  Thanks!!
