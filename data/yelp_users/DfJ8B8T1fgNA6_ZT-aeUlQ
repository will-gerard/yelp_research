I've been going to Barb's for years. Just ask my hips... If you need a delicious birthday cake, rich, wonderful cupcakes, or large sugar cookies with the BEST icing on them , Barb's is for you! Their cookies (as well as some other yummies) are sold at AJ's but don't bother getting them there--go to the source where they're fresh. This place usually has a line around the holidays, because people order their holiday yummies from Barb's. ...and it's ALWAYS worth a wait on a busy day... Consistent, delish, wonderful baked items are always available at Barb's.... Worth the drive from anywhere!!!

The building, ambiance, and interior are gorgeous, warm and relaxing. It's a much cozier restaurant than the old Houston's on Camelback.  The menu is much the same, thankfully.  We started out with the grilled artichoke and it was good (it's not on the menu) but I think the grilled artichokes at Wally's and North are better. We had a party of 7, and 3 people ordered the French Dip Sandwich with fries. Their fries are killer (really thin and yummy), and everyone seemed pleased with the sandwich (at $17 or $18, I wouldn't think of it). Two in our party had the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad ($16) and I was tickled when I tasted it (still, a salad for $16...NOPE!). I ordered the Smoked Salmon starter as my entree ($12) and had a side of their braised red cabbage with goat cheese (to-die-for at any cost). The salmon was okay, but I personally think it needs to be smoked a little longer... All in all, it's a good restaurant with impeccable service.  Still, those prices seem a little steep to me....

It's a strange menu if, like my Mother, you come for a visit from a small town in the midwest. To us Phoenicians, it's a little bit of wonderful, if not a little bit strange of a menu. The food is wonderful, admittedly, I only eat the brucshetta (I know, I spelled it wrong) now because I LOVE it! There are several toppings to select, and they are all yummy!  The salads are very flavorful, but I'd rather eat bread with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or brie and apples, or hot artichoke spread...or...you get the picture. Double delight: you can walk across the parking lot and enter the back door of La Grand Orange and get fabulous Tammy Coe cakes and cupcakes, as well as big, yummy cookies and a variety of other delights. Go early or go late, or you won't find a parking place...or a table.

Wally's is one of our favorite places to eat lunch and dinner. It has a neighborhood feel to it, and the food is consistently delish! The owner, Wally, and his son's run the 2 restaurants and treat everyone that walks in the door like an old friend--which I love.  Their grilled artichokes are to die for, and the pot roast is a must, especially on cold days. The Danish ribs are the best that I've had in the Valley--they fall off the bone and have a devine flavor. Friday lunch special is fish tacos and they are absolutely wonderful! I can go on and on, but you must try this wonderful place yourself!

We;ve all seen the lines around the holidays when people are waiting to pick up their hams for a holiday dinner.  Well, they have cafe's as well, and their sandwiches, soups and salads are wonderful.  If you are looking for a great place for lunch, try it! It's delicious!

I've reviewed this on another post, but this one has a picture and probably getting more noticed. Seriously, this place has some of the best soup I've ever tasted. Today, I tried the white bean soup and it was perfectly wonderful! In addition, I had the classic turkey sandwich, which was on sourdough bread with swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato. Yummy! The turkey is real..meaning it isn't that watered down deli junk you see so many places.  In addition, they have a couple of freezers where you can buy ham bones (to make your own soups), soups, side dishes and turkeys and hams.  This place is REALLY good for soup/sandwiches and the people that work there are so friendly you'd think you were in the heartland!

Love, love, love this place--not only because they saved and renovated an old grocery store, but because their food ROCKS!  Sandwiches, salads, pizza and a few desserts (which I am NOT wild about once tasted, but they are pretty, if you know what I mean). I am sold on the Italia salad, as well as the Farmers salad, oh, and the Picnic salad. My hubby loves the sandwiches (because for some reason, he won't be caught eating a salad in public).  They have some good, inexpensive wines, also. I've never tried any of the beers there but it doesn't seem like it would go well with my salad.  The salads are good size, but not overwhelming. Try one, you'll LOVE it!

You know, I drive to Gilbert to eat a lot, and visit Liberty Market every month. The food is consistently wonderful and the people that work here are incredible.  Does it get any better than that?

Okay, we drive here from Scottsdale to eat lunch....it's fab!  Homemade EVERYTHING, including the bread they use on their sandwiches. I've been meaning to try the salads for a couple of years, but can't get past the delish sandwiches, which are consistently perfect! This place gets crowded (remember what they say about a good restaurant and a wait)  but is worth every minute of a wait. I only wish they would open a Scottsdale location, but driving to Gilbert is worth it to eat here.  The wait staff is very friendly and they get your food to you the second it comes up, so it's super fresh.  Try it, you'll love it!

I love this place. Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  Their pastrami is the best in the state, and their turkey that is used in sandwiches tastes real (as in NOT the watery deli stuff you find in most places). They did get rid of my favorite "sandwich",  the El Paso Wrap, but I've found they'll still make it for me when I get a craving for it. The chicken soups are delish and home made (and wonderful when you are sick with the flu or a cold).  Needless to say, their bagels are killer.  Frequently a line, but worth the wait, if you have the time.  Highly recommend this place!!

I hesitate to do this review, because you can't get into Randy's without a wait, especially during the "season". However, they have great breakfasts at very (as in cheap) prices, and everyone should know it! Randy's doesn't accept credit or debit cards,which is a good business practice, I'd say.  The food comes out so fast that you barely do your Yelp check-in, and voila! your food is at your table! The dinners, in my opinion, are only so-so, but lunches and breakfasts are good, fast, and cheap!

Now I remember why I didn't go back: mediocrity.  I'm not much for chains to begin with, but this place is so strange and I cannot fathom why anyone would wait in line to eat here (or, pick a location, because the menu's are the same). I tried to order the crabcake sandwich and asked the (not-so-nice-fake-smiling) waitress if the brioche had any seeds or nuts on it and she said "no". Sure enough, it came with sesame seeds slathered all over the bun (why or why are there sesame seeds on every friggin bun in this country?). I sent it back and the waitress came over and said "sorry, I didn't know...do you want me to bring it back?" I've never been asked such a stupid question....ever! My husband had the fish and chips and the fish was greasy, the fries were boring and the cole slaw was good.  Seriously, there are some great places to eat here, so why bother with a chicken on everything, nut on everything, corn on everything mediocre meal?

With a line already at the door, one knows Ted's serves up some mighty yummy dogs. In addition, their "white hots" are fab, as well as their burgers.  I'm not keen on their fries or onion rings, but that is just my personal taste...they are both fresh and the rings are home made. The flavor of Ted's hotdogs are unmatched.  Go!

Here is what we ordered:  Ham and Eggs and Steak and Eggs.   Both came with toast and fresh fruit.   I ordered the ham and eggs, and ordered my eggs "over well" and asked the waitress to have my yolks popped, because the sight of egg yolk running around my plate makes me ill. She had a little tude about "over hard" versus "over well", but I thought we had it settled...  My eggs came burned, with brown crispy crap all over them, and they were not hot. The toast came cold, with no butter or jam. The ham was okay, but "off the bone" is an exaggeration. The fresh fruit was good.   My husband's eggs and steak were not hot, and his toast came cold, with no butter or jam, as well.   He complained, and the waitress said she would bring new orders to us, at which time I told her to just forget it as far as my order went, because I was STARVING. She brought me a new order of eggs, and I said that I didn't want them, and off in a huff she went.   When my husband's (new) breakfast was delivered to the table, it was hot and everything was done correctly. However, no toast was present.   What bugs me about this place, besides the fact that we both were served cold food, is the attitude of the waitress.   Yeah, I get it, it's Scottsdale, but as a Scottsdale resident, I am embarrassed by the holier-than-thou attitude you get from some of the businesses here.   We hadn't been here in years, and now I know why.  Despite the long drive, we'll head back to Matt's Big Breakfast, which has THE freshest, most delicious breakfast in this area. And, no attitude...

Thanks, Yelpers, for reaquainting me with this establishment.! This is really good TexMex, very inexpensive, and you get tons of food for very little money.  I had the 2 item combo with a shredded beef taco (big, wonderful and filling) but didn't stop there, and ate the beef burrito too (oink, I am) ...and I managed to consume enough rice and beans and chips to blow myself into the next county (ok, I'll stop there)... Good food, great prices, and it's casual and quick.  Loved it!

You know, if this place ever remodels its patient wards, I'll give them 5 stars. The reality is, this is the best hospital experience I've ever had. I just don't like the patient rooms. The nursing staff is wonderful, friendly, and they work together with the doctors, nutritionists, and patients in a way that appears to be a well-executed symphony. Seriously. I was in awe and impressed. I felt well-cared for, safe and personally saw many of the staff go above and beyond. It was like the doctors talked to the nurses, the nurses talked to the patients, the nurses talked to the testing departments...it works like clockwork.

There is something to be said about an old "stand-by" where you know you'll get a fabulous breakfast, probably have to wait to get seated, and feel like you're back in the "old days" while there.  Such is breakfast at The Original Pancake House.  The owner always says "Hello" like you're a old friend, and he's frequently seen sitting down and chatting with patrons.  The breaksfasts here are always (think consistently) very good, and I can't think of a visit to this place where the food hasn't been wonderful. One caution: they don't take plastic so bring your cash! And, be prepared to wait to get seated.

First, let me say that I don't take any of my "good" clothes here.  I take my "good clothes" to J Dry Cleaner on Indian School Road and 48th Street. Or, Kachina Dry Cleaners on Indian School and 36th Street.  Second, let me say that I don't iron (let the justification drum roll)... Third, I have to wear a uniform (poly/wool blend, in Phoenix, thank you very much) and clean that uniform almost after each wear.  I take that uniform and "everyday" clothes to Seville.  By "everyday" clothes I mean jeans, shorts, and my husbands shirts that are cheap and frankly, gross Aloha shirts.  Those are the only clothes I will take to this dry cleaner, because if something happens, frankly, I don't care.  Sometimes, my pants/jeans/shorts are creased down the middle like I want them (and always request them to be done as such).  Sometimes, they're not.  Sometimes that uniform looks pretty good. Sometimes, it doesn't.  I've taken our cotton shirts/blouses in for laundry service, and they looked aweful... I use their coupons for $1.99 each item, which is the only reason I can justify using this cleaners. They're just not that good... But, then again, it saves me from ironing...

Absolutely, without a doubt, THE GROSSEST excuse for sushi I have ever attempted to consume... Please, God, remind me the next time that I'm in a hurry and craving sushi, to head to the freakin grocery store! The rice was oddly wet and smooshed down (I could barely detect that it was rice), the seaweed was mushy, wet and stringy, and my tempura shrimp roll was the size of a woman's fist.  The whole experience (if one could call it that) was deplorable... The woman did give me my money back after I took the slop up to the counter, but oh, my God, I can't get that foul taste out of my mouth.... What was I thinking?

Wow....reading these reviews is making me scratch my previously perfect-haired head and wondering what went wrong on my visit to Sassoon last week.  It's like waking up in the morning and thinking "I didn't REALLY do that, did I"? and then going to the mirror and immediately getting that sinking feeling that I made a really bad mistake...except this one is going to show for months.  I had been going to the Root and had perfect haircuts from Lauren, but had to cancel my appointment due to the Christmas rush and boy, do I regret it! In addition, I saw a gal while I was eating at Zingburger and she had the perfect haircut and perfect style for me. Rather that ask her if I could take some quick pictures with my phone camera, I decided to "go to the source" of her great haircut and style and booked an appointment with Tobias at Sassoon. BIG MISTAKE! My hair looks very choppy, and the sides are so thinned out that it feels like a good 50% of it is gone (onto the floor at Sassoon). The back is sorta cute but much shorter than I wanted and it doesn't blend at all with the sides. In fact, it looks like I have 3 haircuts plopped on my head and none of it makes sense.  I had my Mom go with me and she just looked at it and said "the back is kind of cute" and my husband didn't say ANYTHING...until an hour later when he said "I told you to leave your hair alone for a couple of weeks...it looked great and now...." I honestly think it was the worst haircut I've had in 30 years, and unfortunately, it cannot be "fixed" until it grows out (Hello! LIke in 3 MONTHS)... This I will say, I like the vibe of the salon itself. And, everyone was very nice. However, as a previous client of Sassoon, I remember the days when EVERYONE walked out of the door looking like a million bucks with classic styles and precision cuts. I didn't view that this visit.  A $92 haircut from the Sassoon's Assistant Salon Director should look a heck of a lot better than this... My friends that have seen my haircut all say the same thing: it doens't blend, it is choppy and it'll grow...

I would like to give kudos to the salon for contacting me and attempting to correct my hair. I was going to take them up on it, but have decided to go where I know I will get my haircut (back to The Root) but I do appreciate their trying to make good on a bad haircut.  Still, it's not for me and I will not return to Sassoon Salon.

I couldn't wait to get home and yelp this place. Five stars, too!  After a (raw chicken) bad experience some 13 years ago, I hadn't been to Bandera until tonight. WOW! It was a GREAT experience!!!  We started off with a grilled artichoke which was fabulous!  Both of us had the Texas Hill Country Ribs which came with cole slaw (not your ordinary cole slaw) and the most delish matchstick fries.  Unfortunately, I don't eat seeds and nuts (peanuts in the cole slaw...my husband loved it) but the very polite and wonderful server, Sarah, offered some other sides and I picked the braised red cabbage, which came with a little goat cheese on the top which was to die-for delish!! Home made wonderful braised red cabbage!  The entire meal was SUPERB! The service was phenomenal, and we were lucky enough to sit by the kitchen and see all of the dishes come out...they all looked YUMMY!  I am so happy that my neighbor suggested Bandera's ribs, and will go back frequently as you can tell this place is run as a tight ship. Everyone is polished, polite and efficient! The food is an experience in perfection, and the service tip top! Next time, I'll take some pictures (if I'm not too hungry)...  I don't think it's a shorts and jeans type of place but a dressy/casual type of place, if you know what I mean... REALLY EXCELLENT FOOD!

The interior of this restaurant doesn't look at all like I expected. No warm music, no tablecloths, no Italian paintings. In fact, it's pretty cold, a bit modern, and not all warm in the ambiance department.   The restaurant itself was empty besides the table by us, and the bar had several men sitting at it. Don't rush out and get your glam on,Girls, they're around my dearly-departed Dad's age .  The food? Very average.   The wine selection? Very small, and red's are not chilled to the temperature's that they should be.   My husband ordered the Shrimp Verde appetizer and the mussel's as his meal.  I ordered the stuffed shells.   My stuffed shells were good, in and of themselves, but the vodka sauce was so salty that I am not swelling up and so thirsty that I am guzzling water.   My husbands shrimp verde was pretty good. Nothing offensive about them. The mussel's were a little fishy, and although I generally love mussels, one was enough.   This place is quite a bit overpriced for what you get, in my opinion.   If you're an Italian, or an italian-food-lover, you may want to try somewhere else..

This will probably be the only 5 stars I will give to a restaurant in the Phoenix area, but who knows? Maybe I'll get lucky in 2011.  We've been going to Ruth's Chris for years and have always had impeccable service and absolute PERFECT food.  One thing I love about Ruth's Chris, every patron in the place is dressed appropriately....a difference I noticed from a recent visit to Flemings.  We go to Ruth's Chris about 4 times a year, and thank God they have "Seasonal" dinners available for $39.99 (or we wouldn't/couldn't afford it, especially with the amount of wine I drink). The menu to the seasonal special dinners is available on their web site and they are quite impressive with several choices available for salads, entrees, sides and a constant dessert (yes, you get dessert too).  Without a doubt, Ruth's Chris is my all-time favorite restaurant, and every employee in the place makes sure your visit is as important to them as it is to you.... I'm going to try to sneak in a few pictures next week but can't guarantee it as I am always so excited to taste the delish food that I forget!

Our annual New Year's Eve dinner at Ruth's Chris was again, perfect!  The filet was amazing, the sides were delish (they have a brussel sprout and bacon side which is yummy!) and the service impeccable.  LOVE this restaurant and LOVE the consistency of GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE!

This place looks abandoned and we should have left it at that, rather than actually eat here. We walked in and the only room that was lit and had people in it was the bar.  The menu looked okay but it was NOT a smoke or steakhouse from what the menu says. If it wasn't for the very nice waitress I would have sent my ribs back (and the mashed potatoes that I was talked into).  I had the "mayfair salad" which the menu states is their version of a caesar salad, and it was the only thing that was palatable. I could not cut the rack of ribs with a steak knife! Hello?! The mashed potatoes were like glue and tasteless.  My husband had the ribeye steak and said it was average, but he did like his baked potato (it's kind of hard to screw up a baked potato, isn't it?).  I will never return to this place, and in my opinion, you should'nt bother with it either.

The best breakfast burritos!  Granted, I've never ordered anything else, and it's only one of many items on their menu, but those breakfast burritos ROCK!  Add condiments/sauces of your choice, and you're starting your day right!  Very clean, very friendly and VERY inexpensive!  Try it! You'll like it!

After reading the Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place today (even though I had sworn off "chop shop manicures") and was pretty disappointed. Seriously, Girls, 5 stars?  I had a manicure and pedicure. Neither were satisfactory. The people that work there seemed okay, but the stares and laughs you endure were anything but relaxing.  The actual mani/pedi was sub-par, at best.  My fingernails are all different lengths. She did an okay job with the cuticles, but nothing special. My feet, well, let's just say I'll be ready for a pedicure in about a week. Personally, I still expect the basics when going to these strip-mall places: nails filed to the same length, cuticles pushed back and trimmed, and feet filed or smoothed.  The fact that someone can massage my feet and hands is unimportant to me if I can't get the basic service done properly. Sorry, but if you value the appearance of your digits, skip this place...

You know that sinking feeling? It's 113 degrees outside when your air conditioner has stopped working?   My husband was out of town, I don't know sqaut about an air conditioning, and I'm dreading the news that I have to buy a new one?   At the recommendation of a friend, I called Jim at Bumble Bee and he was able to fit me in that afternoon. THANK GOD!  I know that this is shocking, but there actually is a Heating and Air Conditioning Company in town that is ...ready? HONEST!  Jim tested my capacitor (my neighbor had checked for everything else, so Jim didn't have to do a lot of testing on the unit)  and the capacitor had failed. He replaced it and added some freon.  I was slightly surprised by my bill, which was $280, because my neighbor had told me that a capacitor is a relatively inexpensive part ($25-$50), but I do believe Jim to be honest and capable..and who wants to argue that when it's 113 degrees?   This is THE company to call for HONEST repair and sales!

Delish! This is a must-go restaurant!  The pit ham and smoked turkey are to die for delicious, as is the brisket!  Love the sides as well (try the cheesey potatoes) and the loaded baked potato is sinfully delish!  There is always a line (evidence of a good restaurant) but it's worth the wait!  I highly recommend Joe's Real BBQ!

You can smell this place several doors down in the mall.  You can smell this place on the street in Waikiki. The store is small (most are) and a little bit of heaven in the scent department.  But, that's not all.  Inside Lush, you'll find all kinds of wonderful treasures for your bath, shower, shampoo, face, skin and body.  Most of what they make and sell is natural (and it's all stated on the information card by the product) and they are mostly all wonderful things.  Believe it or not, I use their face moisturizer (I"m old so don't look for anti-aging activity) called "Skin's shangri la" and it is wonderful. I also use several other products for the bath and shower, as well as facial masks, lip conditioners, etc. and their bath bombs are THE BOMB! One of my favorite stores, since visiting England, I am so happy Lush is local now, so I don't have to order it, and I don't have to take orders and bring stuff back for people when I go to Hawaii.... Truly, a wonderful experience. I love Lush :)

Let me preface this review with a little history... I'm married to a chap from England.  I've been to England. And I eat. A lot. Not too memorable, if you get my drift.  Had I not seen a soon-to-be-opened Scottsdale location, I never would've tried this place. You know, British food and all (keep in mind my British husband who loves these things called mushy peas,  "Bubble and Squeak" and some sort of kidney pie). Ewwww...nuff said.  Well, out of curiosity, I looked up the menu, and off we were to the Tempe location.   It's VERY dark in here, and I imagine that on some cold, winter day, I'd like to spend a few hours in here drinking beer, listening to the awesome music they play and fiddling around with some of the menu items I haven't tried. And I know that when it's hot here, we all like to hide from the sun a little. But seriously, it's a little difficult to see the menu. And the food.   On my first visit, I had "The Porky" which has pork, potatoes, apples, onion and sage. It's served with this delicious red wine gravy. I should've stopped after I asked the waitress for a to-go box, but I couldn't stop eating. It was wonderful. As in AWESOME.  Today, I had the Lamb and Mint. It had lamb, rutabaga, onion and mint. Also, that wonderful red wine gravy. Killer good.   And by now, you're probably aware that all of these delights are contained in this "pocket" of dough, baked and neatly sliced in two when they serve it.  If you sit at the right-hand part of the bar, you can see the cooks prepare all of the food, and it's really quite an art.   The best thing is this: they have all different pasties for all different tastes...italian, mexican, vegetarian, greek and even an American Thanksgiving pasty with turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing and cranberry sauce.   Check out the menu and try this place. ! They have fabulous food, good music and lots of fun beers.   God save the Queen. And Cornish Pasties....

I cannot understand why I haven't visited this restaurant more...it's really good! Two of us went and both had the Double R Chopped Salad and both  agreed it was delicious! The greens were fresh, as were the veggies and meat.  My hubby had the butternut squash soup and it was fab! This is a great place for lunch, but if you're with a group of friends that want to talk, be forewarned: it's LOUD in here! Still, GREAT FOOD and reasonable prices....we'll definitely be back for more!

This place ROCKS! It's a little loud, but it's worth the visit.  Granted, I cannot pronounce half of the things on the menu, but the Jalapeno Cilantro hummus is to-die-for delish.  The Greek salad is awesome, as are the gyros.  I've never made it past the hummus, gyros and salad, but it is consistently great food and quick service.  Always busy, but isn't every good restaurant?  Go! It's yummy! This location is my favorite, as I think the one at Desert Ridge has slightly different tasting food (on the negative side of different tasting, that is).

D'Lish is DELISH!  I finally visited this darling establishment after reading my fellow Yelper's reviews, and I'm glad I did. The guys that work here are super friendly and super cute ( that is soooo inappropriate for me to say at this age)  and they can make a very nice latte and wonderful food! When you read that this is "fast food", don't be scared off that you are going to a chain-type establishment: this IS fast food that is freshly prepared and absolutely D'LISH!

My husband and I had just finished a delicious dinner at Culinary Dropout, and were walking to our car (which was parked in the Nordstrom parking lot). As we approached the PEDESTRIAN CROSSING, I hesitated to make sure that an approaching car had stopped. It had. We proceeded on the PEDESTRIAN CROSSING, and WHOA! A very long black stretch limo zoomed by without stopping, let alone slowing. Let's put it this way: if I continued on my way, I'd be roadkill... My hubby ran up to the driver and asked for his card, which he got. I called the company and explained what had happened, and guess what? The man on the phone said "without a limo number, you're going to have a hard time proving something that didn't happen".  REALLY? Now, if I were to hire a limo/driver some time, I would do so in order to be SAFE when I was out for the evening.  NOT THE CASE with this company, Folks!

Fresh pita bread. Ok gyro meat. Side salad with not-so-fresh lettuce and ingredients. I wasn't impressed at all, and in my not-so-humble opinion, Chicago Gyro's and Pita Jungle are far superior. This is not to say that it was bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about...

Wow, my childhood beckons... It's been a long time since I've been to a genuine meat market, and I'm so glad I made the visit to Hobe Meats. I purchased a living social deal for Hobe, and bought just shy of $98 worth of prime beef for $47, plus my certificate. We froze some of it, and ate some last night...delish! Let me tell you, Folks, it's a treat that is worth the price for prime beef! The cost of the filets (don't forget, this is Prime grade, not choice) was less than what is charged at AJ's, and the flavor is unbelievable! The gentleman that helped us was totally knowledgeable about meat, and the meat business, as well.  In addition to the Prime Beef selection, this meat market has lamb, pork and fish. They have a large selection of Choice beef, too!

I hesitate to do this review because it can get busy in here, and let's face it, who wants to wait when you feel like crapola? This urgent care I have made my "primary care" because it is staffed with ER doctors and you don't get the typical "physicians assistant" treatment.  In fact, when I first went on Labor Day of 2010, the doctor there sent me to the ER and correctly diagnosed me after a month of misdiagnosis by my now former Top Doctor!  Yesterday I went because I have a cold (no big deal) and an ear infection (big deal, I am a flight attendant and have to fly and that is a No-NO with an ear infection). There was a long wait (about an hour and a half) but once I got in to see the doctor, it was 15 minutes and I was out of there! Very clean, organized, and professional, and EVERYONE is very, very nice. Highly recommend this place, folks! Call in advance if you're concerned about the wait...and for God's sake, please cover your mouth when you cough and cover your nose when you sneeze!

I am so happy that I finally went to The Root for a haircut! I've been back several times and extremely happy with Lauren! She does an excellent job at cutting my hair (I don't color yet, but will go to her for that as well!).   She consistently cuts my hair with expertise and care, and there is never a hair out of place with a haircut from Lauren! I wear a "bob" haircut, and several salons have managed to really screw up the cut....NOT Lauren! She cuts it perfectly every time, and is a true master  (she also cuts many of my co-workers hair and they have perfect haircuts as well).   The salon itself is small, unpretentious and very welcoming. I love the fact that hair is all they do, and they do it very well. In addition, everything is clean and fresh and a very comfortable place to be.   I would highly recommend this salon, and especially Lauren, to anyone wanting a GREAT haircut!

Ok, I've gone here for the better part of 2 and a half years, and I wish that I had gone here exclusively for that time. Lauren cut and styled my hair today, and it is absolutely perfect! She had to "clean up" another one of my "let's try this salon" messes, and although my hair is short (enroute to a straight bob cut) she cut every strand of hair with PERFECTION! I "flipped" my hair in the car after my appointment, and EVERY HAIR LAYED PERFECTLY!  Woo hoo!  There is no place like The Root, and no one compares to Lauren when it comes to haircuts!  Plus, the salon is fresh and classy, yet unpretentious and warm.  I LOVE this place!

It's pretty good eating here. The salads, soups, entree's and pizza are consistently good and the atmosphere is lovely. Even though they use farmed-raised salmon in their salads and the entree, it is cooked in a way (and with sufficient spices) that it tastes pretty good and isn't fishy.  All of the salads are wonderful, and the pizza is pretty darned good. I love their tomato-basil soup and the sandwiches are yummy. Some of the desserts look better than they actually are, but the brownies are rich and wonderful and the cakes are pretty yummy, too.  Great place to eat when shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square. In fact, probably the best place to eat while shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square! My husband really doesn't like it when I drag him along because he thinks "it's a women's thing"....FYI.

There's no "deli turkey" here. Berthas roasts a turkey breast every day. Fresh ingredients, fabulous sandwiches and salads...lunch perfection! Go early, or go late, because it's a busy place!

Omg...I'm telling you, the  grilled artichoke at Wally's is the absolute BEST in TOWN!  In addtion, their Pot Roast is consistently one of my favorite dishes, and is so tasty I dream about it (sad, but true). Today, for the first time, I tried their French Dip Two Ways, and elected to have priome rib for the meat, instead of short ribs), and it is bar none the best french dip in this town (so far!?). Wally's french dip has a lot (and I mean A LOT) of prime rib, deep fried onion strings, swiss cheese on a soft, fresh roll. It comes with a side of fries, and you can choose the type of fries you want between regular, sweet potato or a mix! The atmosphere here is always perfect, friendly and the food is fab!

If my neighbors, Joe and Craig (like you care what their names are) hadn't discussed this place in my presence, I wouldn't be here today. I ordered the huevos rancheros, and my husband ordered the steak and eggs. He loved his breakfast so much that he barely spoke.  I loved my breakfast. And I mean, loved it.  Out of a sense of duty, i offered the hubby a bite, and luckily, he was too busy devouring his steak and eggs, thus declining.. My huevos rancheros had perfectly cooked (over well) eggs on top of corn tortillas. On top? A delicious pork green chili that was to-die-for delish. In addition, you get rice and beans, AND hash browns!  Yummy, yummy, yummy!  The place is darling, very comfortable and has very nice personnel that are will to please.  We've already been back, and it was just as good the second time as it was the first! This place is a winner!!!

Its cute and quaint.  Nice personnel.  I ordered pulled pork sandwich with spicy sauce and a side of mac and cheese, as suggested from my fellow yelpers, and I was a happy camper! Full, but happy! The pulled pork sandwhich is HUGE and loaded with tender, flavorful pulled pork. The mac and cheese was good,not great, and next time I'll try the beans as suggested by the nice young man at the counter. I'm going back, soon, to try the ribs, and will update then, but this place is a winner!

Move on over, Pei Wei, PF Changs and Totties Asian Fusion!  Ling and Louie's is on my radar!!  I think, in my humble opinion, that Asian food is rather difficult to find here with any quality. PF Chang's is okay. Sometimes, Pei Wei is pretty good, sometimes, not.  Tottie's Asian Fusion location at Scottsdale and Lincoln Road's is pretty good, but the original has slipped.   Ahhhh, just when I was going to give up, I see Ling and Louie's!   What a delight this was from the get-go! Friendly personnel, a wonderful menu with Thai, Chinese and Japanese flair and selections. And quality, delicious food. Really delicious...  The Black Orchid Ahi sashimi was fresh and fabulous.   The entree we decided on was their Surf and Turf, which is filet of beef, sliced with lots of fresh shrimp, mushrooms and onions on a sizzling platter. We ordered a side of fried rice, which wasn't anything to wrote home about, but satisfactory. The Surf and Turf was to-die-for FABULOUS!   Definitely try this yummy restaurant! You'll never go back to the other Asian places...

My husband went here for a haircut after reading the reviews here on Yelp, and we (I say we, because his haircuts rarely get my stamp of approval!) were very happy! He got a short (yeah!) haircut and it looks great!

After visiting a nearby cell phone company's store, we popped into Best Buy to take a look at their cell phones. You know, for a little comparison (because the gentleman at the company store didn't know squat!). Wow! The young man that helped us really knew his stuff! My husband needed to get rid of his Blackberry before RIM hits the history pages, and thankfully, we got a lot of information on several phones from the Best Buy guy  ( I wish I could remember his name...). He talked tech with my husband for a while, and narrowed the choices down to two phones.  We walked out with a new Samsung cell phone, a lot of knowledge, and totally satisfied.  Well done, Best Buy! Your people really know their products, and it shows! We'll be back!

Yum, yum and more yum!  I haven't been to NoRTH for a couple of years, and was reaquainted with this delightful establishment today.  There were 4 in our party and everyone had a delish lunch!  The grilled artichokes are fabulous, and the salads wonderful!  I had the pasta with butternut squash and brussell sprouts and it was delish!  Excellent service, consistently good food and a lovely experience!

Ok, I"m not saying I'm a wine-o or anything, but IF I were a wine-o, I'd be here all the time. Oh, yeah, I AM here all the time!  Seriously, this is THE BEST liquor/wine/beer store in the Valley.  The staff really knows their stuff, and consistently offers very good advice on wines that fit my palate. The only exception was one gentleman that told me that Cakebread doesn't sell their chardonnay retail (yes they do! They didn't used to, but they do now! Trust me! I DRINK it!).  Excellent prices, excellent inventory, excellent EVERYTHING! Don't waste your time going anywhere else...this place has it all (except Cakebread Chardonnay...you'll have to go to Bev Mo for that).

I've gone to Bliss on 3 occasions, all with Living Social or Groupons. Twice, I've gone to Michelle for manicures, and both were PERFECT! She's a doll, and excellent with all things nails. I had a wonderful facial with Kerry, and was beyond impressed. This spa is friendly and professional. I'm not a "spa girl " but will continue to visit because of the wonderful way they do everything!

After reading the reviews here on Yelp, I decided to try Shea Nails.  The salon IS very clean, uncluttered and soothing in appearance.  The manicurists do speak English, and don't talk about you (or someone else!) in another language, which is a nice change. However, the quality of my mani/pedi was very mediocre.  My nails were shortened (too much) and painted with a clear polish, which started peeling off the next day (it was all off that same day). My pedicure was very lame--one of my nails has a jagged edge (which tore off when I put my socks on) and there was very (as in VERY, VERY) little exfoliating of my feet.  The massage on my feet was nice, but really? If you don't do the nails properly, is there any reason to be there?  Won't go back....there are better salons that do quickie services....

Okay, once again I"m confused: after reading all of the reviews here I thought this place really had it going on. It didn't. And I'm sorry for that, but it was just a bit below average.  The restaurant is cute, and the service was amazing. The waitress was very polite, well-versed and attentive.  However, the food was blah. I had the buffalo shrimp salad and the greens were not fresh. My mother had the chicken salad sandwich and said it was "confusing" and "below average". My brother and nephew both had the philly cheesesteak and liked their sandwiches. My niece had the chicken noodle soup and my sister in law had the fish tacos (which smelled bad)...both didn't like their meals. My husband had the pot roast, which I tasted, and it was average but no where near the caliber of Wally's, which is pot roast paradise!  The prices were resonable, but the food so-so. I wouldn't go back with so many great restaurants here in the Valley, but I hope it improves as it is an independent and I like that in a restaurant...

The Grind. Zinburger. Delux... Those are some of the best burgers I've found here in the Valley.  Indulge isnt one of them. Not by a long shot.  The menu boasts natural, hormone free beef, and you can build your own burger with various buns, cheeses, sauces, meats and toppings. However, if the cook cannot deliver a burger ordered medium temperature, why bother with the bragging?  Seriously...both burgers were well done, dry and tasteless..  Skip this place and head towards Camelback Road in East Phoenix...the best burgers inthe valley are there, not here...

Absolutly the BEST breakfast ive had in the Phoenix area...so far. Off the bone ham, homemade hash browns, fresh eggs and fresh squeezed orange juice, wonderful french toast, and yummy omelettes are offered on their menu, as well as a host of other items.  There usually is a wait, but it's well worth it!  Fast, friendly servers make this a breakfast spot to visit!

Lucky Mesa. You have a Cornish Pasty Company!   Today, we visisted the Mesa location, and it's quite different than the Tempe locale. Quite nice, in fact. There are two large patio's and this location (Mesa) is huge!   My hubby, the Brit, ordered "Scotch Eggs" which is a hard-boiled egg, wrapped in sausage, and quickly deep-fried. It's served with a mustard sauce, and a little salad on the side. My hubby was in Heaven.   We both ordered a cup of soup and a pasty. I had the tomato and it was delish. My hubby's gave me dish-envy: Leek, potato and Stilton cheese...OMG! Try it!   I had my normal "Porky" Pasty, and my hubby had the "Lamb and Mint" pasty. Both were served with that yummy gravy on the side, and both were fabulous!!   I can't say enough about these restaurants. They are both consistently wonderful food, play awesome music, and are an overall PERFECT experience!

The best gyro's I've had here in the Phoenix area...and HUGE!  Very inexpensive (less than $7 for a gyro combo) and great flavor.  Try the greek salad and gyro combo--but be forewarned--their gyro's are very BIG!  It's a little slow in the kitchen but worth it if you're craving a gyro with fries or salad... Very casual, which is great if you're not up to getting dressed to go out to eat!

I used to be a Stabuck's addict. Seriously, addicted...no more...  I went to Dutch Brothers a short time after they opened in this location, and have only been to Starbuck's twice since (and only because there wasn't a Dutch Brothers around...  YUMMY coffee drinks and THE BEST customer service (barista's) around! You won't find donuts and egg dishes here but if you want amazing coffee drinks, go to Dutch Brothers!  My summertime drink is the Freeze which is perfect for summer coffee-drinking! And, the lattes in the winter are wonderful and very tasty! No bitter taste like the competition and absolutely wonderful service! Wish there were more around, but it's worth the drive!

I LOVED The Parlor.   I didn't love the very-full parking lot, but I guess when you have food this good, it's a given that parking may be an issue.  My friend and I both  had the carrot-ginger soup, which was excellent. I had the small cesear salad and my friend had the tuna melt and like it alot. Both excellent!  I am going to try the pizza some day soon (I try to NOT eat pizza, because I love it, and will eat it way too often) and will update at that time. The pizza menu looks wonderful, by the way.  Our  waiter was very nice, the food was served quickly, and the prices were average for a nice place such as this.  All in all, The Parlor is a winner!

I tried this place after reading all of the reviews here on yelp.  I'm glad I did.  The first thing I felt when I drove in the almost-vacant strip center is a sense that I had come to the wrong address. Alas, there it was... Walk inside: clean, comfortable, friendly service, and some of the freshest Mexican food I've eaten!  I had 3 tacos--grilled fish, carne asada and barbacoa.  Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of carne asada, but you all rave about it, so I tried it.  It was good, and very fresh.  After devouring my barbacoa taco, I was miffed as to why no raves on it?  It was absolutely fabulous. Fresh, tender and perfectly seasoned.  The grilled fish taco was really, really good, as well. Very fresh, slightly spicy seasoning and oh-so-yummy.  Did I mention how fresh the food is?  Remember to try the barbacoa..it was AWESOME!  And fresh!

After 3 botched (short) haircuts, I finally made it to the mall and inquired about a stylist that had been recommended to me. Her name is Emi, and unfortunately, she had left the salon a couple of days before my visit.   The girls behind the desk recommended another master stylist, Tammy, and I made the leap and booked an appointment for that afternoon.   Understand, my hair went from shoulder length last summer, to very short and badly cut, so I didn't have room for error.   Tammy was WONDERFUL! She cut my hair in a very short pixie (my husband was speechless) and it's been just over a month and my hair is growing out BEAUTIFULLY!! Who can say that? My hair looks just as good after a month of growth as it did the day I had it cut!!!   The whole experience was perfect, from the shampoo bowl to the cashier.   I have found a gold mine in Tammy and 2BU Salon and Spa.

Well, this is technically not for the salon itself, as it closed abruptly last week.   However, I found Tami, who is my go-to stylist, at Sundance Salon and Spa on Elliot at the Sheraton Four Points in Ahwatukee, and promptly had another perfect haircut today!   If you're a client of Tami's from Evolve/2BU, she's at Sundance Salon in Ahwatukee!!

I've been visiting quite a few frozen yogurt places in the past few months, and so far, this is the best. Not only are their flavors delish, the texture of their yogurt is creamy and wonderful. The toppings rock, as well. It's next to Sprinkles Cupcakes, and in my not-so-humble opinion, it's a better bet than the cupcakes next door.  I visited the Yogurtland in Waikiki this week and it was absolutely delish with local flavors that I bet we won't get here in Scottsdale (boo) but this is by far the best I've tasted in my area.

Really, really good food. Some similar items to Arrogant Butcher (both Fox Restaurants)... Once again, I had the pretzel fondue which consists of this yummy hot cheese in a little pot, accompanied by these absolutely to-die-for "pretzels" . These pretzels are NOT the box variety, but little baby loaves of pretzel bread, which I have now started day-dreaming about... In addition, I had the turkey pastrami sandwich (also on a pretzel bun) and it was perfectly wonderful.  My husband had the ribeye, which was sliced and had a delish blue cheesey sauce on the bottom. He loved it (I snagged a bite, it was mightly good!).  This is was weekend night, and the place was packed with beautiful young people all decked out (well,except for us, that is). The music was a little bit loud (like bar loud) for me, but the food will be calling me back...not to mention that fabulous pretzel bread...

Good Lord, do you have to make life any sweeter? This is a slice of cupcake heaven! Thanks to the reviews here, we took a road trip today and are so happy we did! We got a six pack (it used to mean something entirely different when I was young) and tried the Pink Cadillac, Carrot and Peanut Butter to start. The Pink Cadillac was wonderful, with a filling in it (frosting, filling, that is)and was just delish. The Peanut Butter was good, but every time, every place I get a peanut butter cupcake, I wish I wouldn't have...should've opted for the coconut one, after all.. Next I ate the Orangecream and it was fabulous! It was smooth and thankfully, lacked that overpowering orange flavor that some have. The Apple Pie was delish, and on the rich side (which is right where I want my cupcakes!)... My husband said his carrot cake cupcake was "better than any he's had at Caketini" . However, I still Caketini is better.... So far, I think it's a draw between the two as THE BEST. The (darling) young man in my picture frosting cupcakes is one of the owners, and was a nice as he could be. He told me they're opening a second location in Chandler in about 30 days, so we'll be going down there when it opens.  The Orangecream and Apple Pie were my faves...and they were perfect!! This place has it all, and is worth the drive to taste the heavenly flavors these young men bake up!  Note: If you're visiting the Phoenix area, and heading to Sprinkles, TURN AROUND! There are way better places to indulge!!!

If Culver's were on every other block, like some of the "other" fast food burger places, those "other" places wouldn't be in business.   Culvers has fresh made-to-order burgers and sandwiches which are very tasty, made with fresh ingredients and very affordable! Plus, the burgers taste delish! They remind me of burgers from my childhood, but I can't put my finger on where. Suffice it to say, they're really, really, good.   Their french fries are always hot and yummy, and although I haven't tasted their ice cream, it looks fab!  The personel are always cheerful and friendly, and they bring you your food minutes after ordering...to your table!   Trust me, skip Mickey D's and Burger Queen and go to Culvers!

I couldn't get in to my regular esthetician and called The European Wax Center because I had a flyer from the Val Pak that comes in the mail.  Wow! This place was impressive! They got me in that afternoon with Lynn, and I got a free wax ( I used it for my eyebrows) for my first visit.  The salon is very clean and contemporary in apprearance, but  there wasn't any snobbishness at all from any of the employees.  I was very impressed with the job that Lynn did on me: she waxed my brows perfectly (which isn't easy because my left brow is a completely different shape than my right and has a definite peak in the center), and did a perfect job waxing my upper lip and the back of my neck.  The prices are VERY reasonable and less than what I was paying!  I am hooked and look forward to my next visit!  I highly recommend this establishment for anyone needing to be waxed!

I have nice teeth, no cavities, no big gaps, nothing...just nice teeth.  So, when I refer people to Dr. Tricoli, they say "you don't have any problems with your teeth--why would I listen to you?" Because I have nice teeth.... And, a GREAT dentist! The office is clean, relaxing, and friendly.  The assistant is friendly and very thorough.  The receptionist, Christi, is a doll and very nice and accomodating. The dentist, Dr. Martin Tricoli is AWESOME! He is not a "product or procedure pusher" and is top notch in his skills.  He is friendly, fun (yes, I said fun) and professional.  He'll clean your teeth and fix up your problems (I can say that now that so many of my friends trusted me and went to him) and will not push you into anything you don't need....and I love that!

Delish burgers. Small menu, but I think that's a good thing. Very large burgers with a fabulous flavor. I hesitate to even write this, because it can be hard to get in to this place (it's pretty small to begin with) but if you are looking for a delicious burger (like you get in the midwest) try The Grind-you won't be disappointed! Go early or late for lunch...unless you don't mind a wait.

I cannot fathom why anyone thinks this is good thai.... nothing fresh about anything we ate, and in fact, I was sick (literally) after eating here. Guess I"m spoiled from eating authentic thai in Hawaii all the time, but this is a big thumbs down. Lukewarm spring rolls, a soup that was not close to hot, and miss-the-mark entree's...me no likey....

In the mooooooood for a little beef? How bout a big Zinburger? They're wonderful! Juicy, yummy and HUGE!  The shakes are fabulous as well and only because the burgers are so delish have I not tried a salad.  Busy, busy place and parking has gotten to be a pain at the Biltmore, but worth it...go early or late for lunch and (try to) avoid the crowds.  Excellent service, too! If you're not a huge eater, split the burger because seriously they are BIG! It's a great restaurant, and worth the dough....

Burger perfection!  BIG burger perfection! Split it with a friend or go when you're extremely hungry!   Great shakes, too!  Personally, I'm torn on "Best Burger" between this place and the Grind.  They're different, which is good.   Friendly staff and a clean, airy atmosphere add to the experience...  It's pricey, but you get a heck of a burger for the buck!

Rigatony's is my absolute FAVORITE Italian restaurant in the Valley.   Granted, I have only had their delish salad, bread, lasagne and baked rigatoni with sausage, but the place rocks it every single time we go down there.   The salad is fantastic, and the baked bread is always hot and fresh.   But the star of the show is their Baked Rigatoni with sausage. And I mean the star of the show! Layers of rigatoni, creamy bechamel sauce cradled with marinara and thinly sliced italian sausage topped with melted mozzerella cheese, all served piping hot. It's THE BEST I've ever eaten!   The only drawback is the lack of a second location in Scottsdale, but we'll continue to make the drive because it's that good.   The staff are always very nice, and the food is promptly served.  If you haven't tried Rigatony's, and you love Italian food, get in your car and go!! It's worth the drive from anywhere!

I wish that I didn't like this place so well...but I do :) Yummy, fresh, delish donuts like I used to have on Saturday mornings as a kid (my Dad would go to the now-defunct Dad's Bakery and get donuts and pastries on Saturday mornings). There is a wide variety available, and they are wonderful! In addition, they have great coffee drinks, as well.  After trying Bosa Donuts, you'll never visit a Dunkin Donuts again...

I am going to take an uneducated guess that ALL of the locations are delish...I just ate at this location today (and how did I NOT know there was one close to me?) and again had the Double R Chopped Salad...hold the corn and peppers, please.  This salad is very large for me (even my hubby can't eat a whole one) but it's so reasonably priced, who cares? It has the freshest greens, rare roast beef (that actually tastes like roast beef...), carrots, celery, jicama, red onions, marinated mushrooms, gorgonzola cheese with blue cheese dressing. It is FAB! This location is quieter than Arcadia, but it's set up a little differently and buffers some of the sound (?..I have no idea but it's a guess).  EVERYONE is very nice, smiles, and I believe, really cares that you have a great experience. Quite a departure from some places...and a nice departure, at that! I am vowing to try the (limited time) braised beef sandwhich very soon and update the review, but this place is rock solid delicious! Oh, by the way, the bread is WONDERFUL!

I can't get enough of Wildflower Bread Company! Can you tell? Did you know they use wild Alaskan salmon in their salads,etc?  Did you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes?  Always very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get!  I finally tried something a little different today: 1/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS! Every bite was pure deliciousness!  Although I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well!  This place ROCKS!

I've been waiting for 21 Cakes to open and today was the day! I got there a little late (1 p.m.) so there weren't too many cupcakes left (they were a huge success!)  but the bakers were busy in the kitchen baking more and frosting away! The Bubble Gum Cupcake has white cake with confetti throughout, topped with a fabulous bubble gum buttercream frosting (in pink and green, my favorite colors, no less! In addition, I bought the chocolate peanut butter which was (finally!) an absolutely delish chocolate/peanut butter cake topped with buttercream frosting.  WONDERFUL doesn't begin to describe the flavors!  These are not the huge variety of cupcake like Caketini, but normal-sized (good, I can eat more of them) and fresh beyond belief!

I am not feeling the love from the "Cupcake Love In" held today at the Valley Ho Hotel in Scottsdale. In fact, there were quite a few people waiting in line with us that were not feeling the love, either.   As it turns out, the event was sold out online on Thursday. The web site to the event did not indicate this yesterday, to the best of my knowledge ( I was on there to buy tee shirts). In addition, there were no signs at the Valley Ho indicating that the event was sold out and people were still attempting to buy tickets at noon (we stayed at the hotel and had breakfast at Cafe ZuZu, which was pretty darned good!).   In defense of the event planner, it was the first annual Cupcake Love In.   However, with the obvious popularity of cupcakes here in the Valley, one would think the planner(s)  would foresee the necessity of having a large enough venue to accomodate that popularity.

WOW! These are SUPERB ! I only wish they came in miniature size! We had an orange, s'mores, carrot, celebration and chocolate one that I cannot recall the name because I was in sugar heaven!  All of the cupcakes were super-fresh and absolutely delish!  Coming from Scottsdale, I am delighted to say that it's too far of a drive to do too often (thank GOD or I would be shopping for bigger pants!) but it was quite a wonderful experience!  The BEST cupcakes I have tasted (so far, and believe me, I'm a fanatic) in the Valley!  The storefront is at San Tan Village by Macy's and is very clean and the staff is very friendly.  If you like (or LOVE in my case) cupcakes, GO!  They bake cakes too, and they look delish in the pictures but didn't have any on the shelves.... YUMMY A+ PS I did take pictures before the gobbling began but the they didn't turn out ..

I wish I would've known about this little gem a long time ago.  Yesterday's lunch at Fuego Tacos was downright wonderful! I had the Purist Ground Beef taco and the Short Rib Barbacoa, and both were top-notch!  The flavors are fresh and fabulous, and very different than the traditional shredded cheese and lettuce that one tends to find. The restaurant itself is located in the now-deathly quiet Esplanade Center in Phoenix, right accross the street from the Biltmore Shopping Center.  And parking requires either a valet or a parking structure, which isn't my first choice when going to a restaurant, but with food this good, it's worth the effort! The service was excellent, and our waiter was very funny and entertaining, as well as providing very fast service.  I'm definitely going again, soon, and will try a burrito on my next visit!

I'm in hog heaven (literally)...  Finally, great BBQ in Scottsdale! I'm so excited!  This cute, funky place occupies the old Nellos location on First Avenue in Old Town and is nicely (but not overly) decorated in BBQ. It's comfortable, roomy and tasteful.  The menu is full of delicious BBQ/Southern items and from what we tasted, fabulous food!  We both had the brisket sandwich, which was A LOT of smoked, rubbed beef brisket on a simple white bun. The sandwich has cole slaw on the bottom and you can dress it with a small selection of Big Earl's sauces.  You pick a side, and I chose the collard greens which were fabulous. My husband had the beans as his side, and they were equally delish.  We had their banana pudding which comes with a chocolate whipped topping, and throughout this delightful dessert, you'll find banana's and Nilla wafers.  This is an independently-run restaurant, and an absolute delightful, delicious addition to Old Town Scottsdale.  Be hungry, as the portions are big and the taste, heaven!

Seriously, this place is the BEST BBQ I've eaten in the Phoenix area! We had the brisket plate and the meat had such a wonderful flavor and texture...we were surprised that no knife was needed.  Huge portions (we brought half home and ate it the next day and it was just as yummy) of delightful brisket that is hand-rubbed with delish spices and a side of beans with cornbread..... The chef brought out (he was so nice, and wanted us to try it) deep fried mac and cheese with bacon and it was fabulous (and I mean, FABULOUS). Everyone is so nice and the food is FANTASTIC!

Today is (or should I say, was) the first day of my "no eating cupcakes" diet.  However, the lure of "salted caramel" cupcakes was too much to bear, and I ended up trying TopIt Cupcakes. The storefront is really cute, and clean, and the people that work there are very nice! There is a little area on the wall where you can "top it" if you want to add to your cupcake toppings, as well ( I've never seen that before, but it's a great idea). Now, for the sugary details.  I only ordered 2 cupcakes today (down from the normal 6, but I cannot continue to eat like this and fit in my skinny jeans!). Although I have never had a good peanut butter cupcake (usually too greasy) I ordered a peanut butter and jelly cupcake, and of course, salted caramel. Both of the cupcakes were good in flavor, but the salted caramel could've used more sea salt (just a tad more, mind you).  The peanut butter and jelly (finally!) was my fave of the day. It was a white cupcake filled with grape jelly with peanut butter frosting (and, a little cookie on top). FINALLY, a cupcake store that got peanut butter right! Here's the negative on TopIt: Compared to Caketini (the best I've tasted so far) the cupcakes both were a little on the no-so-fresh-in-texture side. Not that the cupcakes were dry, but the tops were a little "crusty". I know...picky,picky, picky... I get that they don't use preservatives, and I am happy for that, but just a tad more on the fresh side would've snagged me for life...or the life of my skinny jeans... Also, these cupcakes are "normal" size, which I personally like better than the biggies at some of the other cupcake stores... Still, this place has a lot to offer in the cupcake world, and I'll definitely be back on Fridays for Cotton Candy, Malted Milk Ball and whatever I can stuff in my ever-growing tummy.

I LOVED this place! Lovely atmosphere, friendly service and killer food! We split the House Soft Pretzels (house made) and Provolone Fondue, and it was perfect (in face, we couldn't get enough!) and Turkey Pastrami Sandwich, which was on a (house made) pretzel bun with coleslaw, swiss and a delightful mustardy sauce.  Absolutely delish food! Can't wait to go back!  Try it--you'll LOVE it!

If you're a  Taco Bell lover,this isn't the Mexican food for you. However, if you love a little (or a lot) of heat and authentic Mexican food, which is carefully prepared, this is IT! My friend had the pork and I had machaca, and both were absolutely fabulous. You can taste the wonderful flavors in every bite, and can tell that great care was taken in preparing our lunches. In talking with the owner, it appears that there have been some service issues since this location opened in December, but apparently, those issues have been resolved.  The restaurant is very nicely decorated, and although they were somewhat busy, we had great service and a perfect meal.  If only Los Dos Molinos were in Scottsdale....

If you're in the market for a fabulous (and I mean FABULOUS) sandwhich, or a big, flavorful salad, you must go to Urban Picnic! If only this little storefront was a tad bigger! There are tables outside where you can sit and savor the wonderful sandwiches and salads from this delightful eatery, but be prepared to stand in line to order.  I had the turkey and stuffing sandwhich and it was huge and tasted wonderful! The roast beef with parmesean cheese and horseradish creme was awesome, and the BLT is a traditional sandwhich made with lots of yummy, thick-cut bacon. YUMMY!!!

I don't eat pancakes or waffles, so if you're on the hunt for those items, disregard this review.   However, if you eat eggs, there are better breakfast places in the Valley to go for breakfast. Trust me.   The last few times we visited Butters, I've made the mistake of ordering scrambled eggs. They literally looked like a scoop of wet, yellow poo. And I'm being nice here.  These so-called "scrambled eggs" didn't look like real eggs at all, and because of the "texture"  and "wetness" of them, I can't imagine what in the world I was eating (or trying to eat). I had them with one of their skillet breakfasts which had onions, bacon, mushrooms and potatoes, topped with this glop of yellow, wet "stuff".   After vomiting violently for over two hours, I've vowed never to return to try anything else at Butters, because seriously, there's way better places for breakfast that actually use eggs that have a yolk and egg white that is visible.   The only reason I"m giving this place 2 stars is because, like I said, people say the pancakes are good, and I'll have to take their word for it.   Sorry, Butters, but Matt's Big Breakfast, The Original Pancake House, Snooze, Scramble and a host of other breakfast hot spots have you beat. By far...

We ordered two BBQ Bacon and Cheddar but we changed the cheese to swiss and nixed the BBQ sauce. The personnel were very accomodating and polite, and I soooooooooo wanted to dig this place. They boast 100% Angus Beef, and have nice, pretty pictures on the wall of what looks to be like fast-food-burger heaven.  We were disappointed. The burgers were okay, but really had very little flavor. The fried onion strings on top of the burger were not even warm (neither were the fries) and the egg bun wasn't very fresh tasting (or feeling).  I'd rank this way  below Culvers Butterburgers, and a pinch below Fatburger, even with McDonalds.  Sorry, Smashburger, you just didn't do it for me...

In November, I visited this Smashburger, and did not have a good experience.  Today, I decided to give them another try (after all, I was at Tempe Marketplace and starving! ) and had a very different experience.  I had the mushroom/swiss burger with fries, and both were delicious.  The burger was juicy, hot and cooked to just the right temperature. The fries were hot and yummy, as well.  I stand corrected: Smashburger is damned good!

My only disappointment with The Habit is that it's so far away from me. Seriously.   I was in Tempe to get my hair cut, and had some time to kill, so I went into The Habit to check out their menu. I ended up ordering the mushroom/swiss burger, and was pleasantly surprised!   The mushrooms were fresh and sauteed when I ordered. The burger was pretty damned good for "fast food" (it's not the drive-thru variety--these are grilled to order, but it's not a gourmet burger establishment). The cheese was perfectly melted, and although the beef was a little over-done, it tasted amazing!   When one compares the quality of burgers from places like The Habit and Culvers, it makes you wonder how McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's stay in business.   They're adding locations in Paradise Valley and north Scottsdale, thankfully. For now, I"ll drive down to Tempe to cure the burger itch!

I've resisted visiting Burgers and Bottles, simply because it appeared to have no atmosphere.  And, it doesn't. Seriously, yellow walls? No window treatments (and the sun shines in and trust me, is bothersome) and a pretty sterile environment. Those are the cons. The pros: excellent burgers, wonderful seasoned fries, and very (as in so nice and helpful that you'd swear you were living in the '60's and visiting the set of Happy Days and eating at Al's Diner) personnel. I tried the Santa Fe burger and it was delish... Havarti cheese, green chilies, avocado relish, roasted red peppers and tomato that is served on a pretzel bun (which happens to be my favorite bread/bun in the whole world).  All the burgers come with fries, but you can substitute rings, fried pickles, bottle caps or fried green tomato. Cost with a soda about $11 and worth every penny!  All in all, this place is awesome, as for the atmosphere, I'm determined to convince whoever owns this burger paradise to convert it into something a little more conducive to eating burgers and drinking beer...a patio would be spectacular here!

I love Zoes!  Their coleslaw is to die for, and the housemade hummus is creamy and wonderful!  I've had nothing but delicious food here, and can't say enough about the freshness and flavor of all of the dishes I've tried. Their chicken salad tastes like the yummy chicken salad I've eaten in NYC, and the tuna salad (with mayo version) is wonderful!  So far, Zoes is consistently great food with very nice personnel!

Yes, I did swear off chop shops,  but when I complimented a friend last weekend on her pedicure, I was shocked when she told me her pretty toes (and fingers!) were the product of Pro Nails by Julie.  Ordinarily, I would've avoided this place, not only because it's in a pretty dead, tiny strip mall, but also because I was ready to pay big bucks again for a good manicure and pedicure. Guess what? I was amazed today! I got a pretty damned good pedi and mani at Pro Nails, and for $38 (I paid extra five dolla for a callus removal) I am pretty impressed with this place.  Of all of the "chop shop" nail places that I have been (and sworn off) this is a delightful surprise!  I'll be back, and you should go, too!

The first time I tried Pro Nails, I had a pretty good experience.   When I returned on April 7th, the place was bustling, and there were a lot more nail technicians working at Pro Nails.   The gal that did my mani/pedi was very nice. However, the quality just wasn't there.   My fingernails are different lengths, and my pedicure was very mediocre.   All in all, this was a typical "chop shop" experience.   When will I learn?

I've been going to another waxing chain for years. After my favorite waxing specialist left town, it's been difficult to find the level of expertise that I had. Today, I visited Urban Wax, and will be a regular! Jessica was so nice, and knowledgeable that I am sold on Urban Wax! Reasonably priced, friendly and a perfect waxing session sold me.

I'm basically a chain-hater (well, I dont hate them, but I try to avoid them). Capriottis is an exception. This delicious sandwich shop has some of the best sandwiches I've  had for the type of establishment that it is: a chain sandwich shop. The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous! The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste. You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well! Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh. Their personnel are very friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and it can be the best quick sandwich you've ever had...you just have to go!

After years of patronizing the "North Scottsdale Top Doc" dermatologist, I decided to try Dr. James Pehoushek at the recommendation of a friend.   When I looked up a little information here on yelp, I actually hesitated because the few reviews were not good. However, the negative reviews, for the most part, deal with the allergy division of this practice, not the dermatology area.   Dr. Pehoushek gave me a thorough skin cancer screening, and treated some problem areas. In addition, I have had some skin issues with my face and he discussed why I was having them, and prescribed some medication to clear it up.   What I like about this doctor and office: Very friendly, very competent, very thorough, NO ATTITUDE, and for once, I felt like I was going to an old-fashioned doctor.   Not only do I highly recommend Dr. Pehoushek, but chicken-me look forward to returning...

Remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old lady asking "where's the beef?" Well, ditto that... We split the green chili beef chimi and although it tasted pretty good, there were literally three small pieces of beef with virtually no green chilis. As Klohe Kardashian said at her sister's wedding, I give it six f'in months...unless they add some meat to those meals...

Rueben sliders..fab (and less than five bucks at happy hour) This is a big place, with lots of TV's and noise, but the atmosphere is nice, and the personnel, great! They have a great selection of beer, as well as wine (good wines, too) and great happy hour menu!

I wish there was a "chain" category. Cafe Zupas is now the second good chain restaurant I've been to!  I had the "Try 2 Combo", $7.99, and chose the Boston Crab Melt sandwhich and Thai Lobster Curry soup. Both were pretty darned good!  The menu looks great, as does the restaurant itself.  The personnel were very nice, accomodating and welcoming. One strange occurance was when I went to take a picture of their brownies, a lady that worked there told me they don't allow indoor photographs (wierd!).   All in all, I totally enjoyed my lunch and will be back.  Desert Ridge peeps...you're getting one soon..

Usually, when a storefront or restaurant has signage that it is "Under New Management" I run.  However, a growling stomach and a few minutes to kill before an appointment next door, I decided to try Z Pizza.  When I walked in the door, I saw a turn table, of sorts, with several pizza's in it, and was even more wary. I looked at the menu, and decided to order a couple of slices of pepperoni, and a drink.  Guess what? It was REALLY GOOD PIZZA!  The crust was super thin (which I love) and the cheese gooey and yummy!  There wasn't a lot of grease oozing from the slices, and the flavor was downright fabulous!  This place as "healthy" pizza (ordinarily, another red flag for me...I don't want healthy pizza!) in that their sauce is organic, and they use gluten-free whatever-it-is in their crust.  I would definitely go back for more!

Damn. If we truly are what we eat, I'm in trouble.  Anyone that reads my reviews knows I hold Matt's Big Breakfast at the top tier of breakfast places. Every time I go to Matt's I get friendly service and PERFECT breakfast...and they are the only place in the Valley that get's the 5 stars for breakfast (at least in my book).   That being said, we have been to Oink Cafe a few times and are impressed.   This is a bacon place. They have about 8 different kinds of bacon, and all are really yummy.   The Omelettes are pretty damned good, I have to say. The Country Potatoe's are really good, as well. The egg and meat (think bacon) dishes are very good.   So, if you can't make it to Matt's, come here. They're on to something, and it's very, very good.

Before I begin, let's put this in perspective, ok?  Dickey's is a chain, and I don't particularly care for chains.  Two years ago, we visited the Dickey's up on Shea, and had an immediate adversion to the place. The brisket was tough, the sides were mediocre, and the people that worked there looked like they could've cared less...about anything.  Today, I visited Dickey's for the second time, but in a new location, close to home.  I was starving, craving ham, and wanted to check it out, you know...in case I contracted a hangover some day and needed some immediate BBQ relief (this is kind of a joke). I had the 1 Meat Plate, with ham, and tried the BBQ beans and cole slaw for sides. Pretty good. Better than the other BBQ place I recently reviewed close to home.  Not as good as Joe's in Gilbert (no where near Joe's perfection) but pretty damned good.  The line is substantial since their opening a few days ago, and the place is small, but nice personnel that are eager to please, and pretty damned good BBQ... I'll be back...

Today was my second visit to Wag N Wash, and it was just as good as the first visit.   The people that work here are super- friendly and helpful. They'll explain the process to you, get your supplies, and show you the ropes.   The wash bins look like they are the type used in grooming salons,  and the dryer area has several areas to dry your pets after their shampoo's.   I haven't tried the groomer at Wag N Wash, but this place is a fun place to take your pets to have a little field trip and do it yourself.   In additon, they sell premium pet foods, supplements, toys, leashes and collars.  Plus, I'm saving a LOT of money!

Have you ever been to a restaurant, and then dreamed about repeating a wonderful experience? No? I must be sleep deprived. Or hungry...  I probably would never had tried this restaurant if it hadn't been for my friend that lives in Gilbert. We met for a little shopping and lunch, and decided to try TQLA.   The restaurant is nicely decorated, and the outside patio is super cute!   We split the steak fajitas, and OMG! they were so good!   The meat, I believe, is ribeye, and was very tender and flavorful. What makes it even better is that when the sizzling platter comes to your table, there is a little butter on top of the meat (YUM!). There was a little cup of something on the side that we thought was a flavored butter, and we just plopped it right on top, and it was really tasty (we think it may be an ancho butter, and it was really good).   The personnel are very nice and attentive, as well.   Anyway, I'm dreaming of those fajitas. Every night.

Milagro Grill was a total and wonderful, surprise!  When you drive into the strip center where it is located, you notice a rather large patio( which is covered), with several tables, sofa's and misters to cool you off.   Upon entering the restaurant, which is absolutely darling, you're greeted by a super-friendly hostess, and seated. Immediately, a very nice, and accomodating member of the wait staff will give you all the details of this offerings of this dynamite establishment.   We got there at 6:28 on a Saturday, and the waitress immediately told us there were two minutes until Happy Hour ended. We quickly looked at the Happy Hour menu, ordered four appetizers,and drinks.   WOW! The food is FANTASTIC!  We ordered the guacamole with salsa and freshly made chips, Steak Tacos, Short Rib Tacos and Camarones Dulces. ALL were absolutely DELICOUS! Although I wasn't wild about my Sangria, my husband tried a glass of red wine that he loved.   This has become my go-to restaurant for upscale Mexican food, and I love the fact that it's owned by a local family (Macayo's family), the food is wonderful, the restaurant is very relaxing and pretty, and the staff is extraordinarily accomodating.   See you there!

Addiction: America's Taco Shop pork, aka, pastor.   My husband loves the carne asada (I'm not a fan of carne asada, but this is pretty good nonetheless), but let me tell you, the pork is fantastic! I get the pork taco's, burrito, whatever form I can get!   It's very casual, inexpensive, and the staff is great!   Parking is a wee bit of a pain, because Arcadia Farms is in the hood and they hog the street parking, but it's worth a short walk to eat here...

I discovered So We Meat Again from a groupon, and am very happy I did!   Although I'm not much of a sausage lover, the bacon they smoke is pork PERFECTION!   When I returned to purchase more bacon, I tried a sandwich, and it was delish, as well! It gets a little busy around lunch time, and there aren't many tables, but the sandwiches are really good!   However, if you're a bacon lover, you must go and get some of their maple-smoked bacon...your kitchen will smell like maple bacon heaven, and the flavor of that bacon is absolutely pigglicious!!

Everything about The Stand is delicious. Everything.   Everything at The Stand is fresh...right down to the homemade lemonade.   The staff? Friendly, helpful, and welcoming.   I usually get The Standard with cheese (Two house-ground patties, fresh lettuce, tomato, onion and lettuce). Once in a while, I'll add Niman Ranch bacon to the mix.  The burgers are consistently delicious...every single time.  Yesterday, I tried the short rib tacos, only because it's so hot outside, and I didn't want a heavy meal. They were TO-DIE-FOR delish! BIG hunks of tender, perfectly seasoned short rib meat, and fresh onion, cilantro, pickled cabbage and cojita cheese. They were FABULOUS!!!   This place is small, and usually a little crowded, but don't let that deter you. It's definitely THE place to go for wonderful burgers, freshly made fries and the best tacos I've ever had...  My only suggestion? A single burger for the smaller appetite...

I've been to some of the best salons in this town, and had great hair cuts. On the other hand, I've been to some of the best salons in this town and had down right bad hair cuts.  I ordinarily would not venture into a chain salon, or a salon in a strip center with a grocery store. I know that sounds snobish, but it's true.  After a(nother) bad hair experience from a salon in Honolulu, I have tried and tried to get in to a classic stylist at yet another "top" salon here in Scottsdale, but the stylist I wanted isn't taking new clients.  After doing several hours worth of research here on yelp, and out of desperation (because I don't look good in hats), I tried Arizona Hair Company today, and got in with Susie.  She cleaned up my mess, and gave me a great haircut! I"m completely in shock (happy shock) and very satisfied with my hair cut!  I have short hair, and she did an awesome job! AND, my hair cut cost my $26! $26!!!!

Haircut number 2 from Susie today.  It's been just over 2 months since Susie cut my hair for the first time, and this haircut was also.....PERFECT! . Again, I'm shocked that I am getting an excellent haircut, consistently,  and for $26.    I'm sold on Susie at Arizona Hair Company!

I LOVE Foosia!   When Yelp reviewers say it's "Pei Wei meets Chipoltle",  they nailed it.   Although a bit intimidating on your first visit, the staff is more than happy to explain how it works, and they will let you try the sauces and recommend additions to your meal to help you navigate the ordering process.   The food is fresh, healthy and excellent!   Check it out! You'll love it!

We love Paul Martin's American Grill. The salmon grilled on a cedar plank is fabulous, and the short ribs are killer.  They have a wonderful deal on Monday nights (called Monday night wine dinner) and you get two organic salads, two entrees (any entree on the menu) and a bottle of wine (good selection) for $49!!  In addition, their Happy Hour is wonderful!  The staff is cordial and friendly (we like that in Scottsdale) AND they use local ingredients where they can.  What's not to love?

This establishment is in the building that was Salty Seniorita, but you would never know it. It's totally opened up on the inside, and attractively decorated in an industrial style motif. Some of the tables are held up with kegs as legs!  There are 30 beers on tap, and countless local beers offered. They even have WINE on tap! And, they offer Root Beer on tap for the kids.  The staff is very friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS! The menu has a little bit of everything from burgers, salads, sandwiches and dessert.   There's ample parking on the side and back of the building, which is refreshing for Old Town Scottsdale.  I'm taking a guess that during "the season" we won't be able to get a seat at the bar or a table, because it's that good.

We ventured into Drexyl last night after changing our minds about another restaurant. And, we're glad we did. The menu is awesome, with choices that range from appetizers, salads, sandwiches and burgers to entrées.   I ordered the halibut, which was served with charred bok choy, forbidden rice, shiitake mushrooms and a delicious coconut curry sauce. Every part of my dinner was divine.  My husband had the Pacific Coast Sole, which was served with lemon sauce and capers, fresh vegetables and petite potatoes. It was absolutely delicious, as well.  The room is open, comfortable and not pretentious. The managers were working the room and ensuring all the guests were pleased with their meals.   The prices are very fair considering the high quality of the food.   I highly recommend Drexyl. We feel like we found a real treasure, and will be back!
