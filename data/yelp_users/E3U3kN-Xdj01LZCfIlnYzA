Long story short, this is the best sushi place on this side of town.   I have been here probably 20 or so times and felt a review was long overdue. I come here for lunch almost every Friday as that's the only day of the week they do lunch. I have been here for dinner many times as well and it's very good. This review will discuss lunch.  Get here very close to 11:30 if you're coming on Friday for lunch. There are tons of regulars and the sushi bar will be filled in the first few minutes so it's ideal to get here right around 11:30.  When I come for lunch, I get the same thing every time. It's a variation of their sushi special, but instead of a cut roll, I just get some more nigiri. This is without a doubt, the best quality:price ratio in existence when it comes to sushi. 11 pieces of well-crafted, fresh nigiri, with thoughtful and delicious garnishes. I have also been there when the have live shrimp and it's well worth the splurge.   Service is always good. Overall, this is probably my favorite place to go for lunch, even if it's only open on Fridays.

TL:DR- Worst sushi meal of all time. $175+ per person for omakase. Nearly no sushi served. Ponzu spilled all over me. Got horrible food poisoning. Nothing on bill was comped despite our constant displeasure.  I went here for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely the worst and most disappointing omakase experience of my life. We called ahead for reservations and to confirm that Yasu would be able to serve omakase. We asked for seats at the bar, which they said couldn't be reserved, but would be accommodated on a first come first serve. No problem, we got there right when it opened.   We arrive at the restaurant and there is nobody there. We ask to be seated at the sushi bar like we talked about and the woman up front said that they were unable to accommodate. Huh? First come first serve and we are the first and only people here on a tuesday. Hostess says,"Sorry, some of Yasu's friends will be dining here tonight and we have reserved the bar for them." OK? We called 30 minutes before our reservation as we were leaving the house and they said it wouldn't be a problem if we showed up early. Apparently people willing to pay $200 per person on their Birthday are still treated as second-rate diners. Who knew? To finish off that thought, Yasu's friends who took up the first come first serve bar showed up an hour and a half after us and it was just two of them. Obviously enough to lock down the whole bar.   On to the food. One word- HORRIBLE. Absolutely the worst sushi meal that I have ever had. I have been to probably thousands of sushi meals and dined at many of the top sushi places in the US. I would rather have gone to a revolving sushi bar with smelly fish. At least you know what you're getting into from the start there. The fact that I paid over $550 for three people wasn't even my issue. The food was seriously disgusting and the service did not make up for it.  Having been to Yasu before, we asked if they could add the Yasu-style Salmon to our omakase order as it was one of our favorite. They said yes or Yasu would make something like it. 12 courses later, not a single piece of nigiri sushi had come out, despite our constant pleading. There was almost no sushi served except for two sashimi-style courses. All of the sushi was doused in so much sauce, it made me think I was at a revolving sushi bar restaurant and not at a high-end Japanese restaurant. In all cases, the sauces were incredibly overpowering. It made me think that the fish was not fresh as I can't imagine any other reason to hide the flavor of the fish that much.  Aside from the fact that almost no raw fish was served, the cooked dishes were not good. They served fried smelt fish that were completely bland and greasy. It was very frustrating as we kept asking our server for more nigiri/sashimi and he kept saying he would talk to Yasu. It never came. We were openly telling our waiter how disappointed in the food we were every time especially offensive dishes came out. Don't worry, nothing was taken off the bill.   Service was OK. One of the servers clearing my plate spilled an entire plate full of ponzu sauce in my lap on my brand new jeans that I got for my birthday. I wasn't joking about the amount of sauce on each dish. At least two cups of ponzu went into my lap after the plate was cleared.   Overall, my experience at Yasu was disgraceful at best. Every part of it was riddled with issues. Totally unacceptable at any price point, but absolutely deplorable for this price. Despite all our complaints, neither Yasu or anyone from management came out to talk to us. Nothing comped. No apologies. Absolutely the worst sushi meal of my life and quite possibly the worst meal of my life, period. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO LITERALLY ANY OTHER RESTAURANT ON THE PLANET. Icing on the cake: GOT HORRIBLE FOOD POISONING FROM THIS MEAL.

This is the best place to grab a steak in the greater Phoenix area. Service is top notch and food is spectacular. Only downside is that the menu is pretty stagnant. Typically nothing crazy in terms of specials, but what does it matter, you're going to get your favorite steak anyway.  Food:  Crab Cakes and Tuna Tartare are awesome for appetizers. Can't go wrong with either one.  Seafood Towers- They will make you a custom seafood tower with whatever chilled seafood you want on it. These are pretty expensive, but are really awesome if you don't mind ponying up the cash. Crab claws are pre-cracked and prepared so that the entire claw of meat comes out in one piece with zero effort. Have had shrimp, oysters, and king crab with the tower before and they are all great. Have dry ice steaming out of the top for a pretty cool presentation.  Steaks- I almost always get the bone-in filet. They cook their steaks exactly how you want them and are seasoned perfectly.  Sides- Lobster mashed potatoes, Black truffle gnocchi, and the mushrooms are all favorites. At this place, I highly doubt anything is sub-par.  MOST IMPORTANT --- Dessert- Get the butter cake. I don't care if you don't like cake, butter, sugar, or just dessert in general. It doesn't matter. It's the best dessert on the planet. I could honestly go just for this.   Overall, this is my favorite place to go to for a nice romantic dinner. Their service is over the top excellent. I have been here over a dozen times. The only time that I had a mildly bad experience (steak came out very undercooked) the general manager comped the steak and sent me a gift card to come back and have dinner for two on him. I believe his name was Jester. I really appreciated that. City Hall will have my business for life. Don't know how I didn't mention this until the end, but the have really excellent bartenders and make some of the best martinis and manhattans in town.

Figured this would be the best restaurant to write my first Yelp review. Came here for a birthday dinner with the family. To start off, they come pick you up in a limo and bring you in through the high roller entrance which I had no idea was even there. From there, you are escorted to the restaurant. Every single part of this meal/experience was perfection. We did the chef's tasting course and ate so many incredible things that it's tough to pick out my favorites, but I'll list a few:  The bread cart- seems like a weird thing to rave about. It's ridiculous. There are about 100 different types of breads and rolls. You pick which ones you want and they bring them out piping hot from the oven. Incredible.  Amuse Bouche(sp?)- This was a pre-meal compliments of the chef type deal. It was a round tin filled with caviar and king crab. I don't even like caviar, so yeah, it was that good.   Entrees- All very good, but I had a braised beef cheek that was off the chain.  Dessert Cart- Same idea as the bread cart. They bring out a cart with 50+ desserts on them and you pick whatever you want. Everything was delicious.  Overall, this place is probably one of the top 5 restaurants that I have ever been to, if not the best. Pricey, so maybe more of a special occasion type place unless you're ballin' then it doesn't really matter.

Came here for dinner while staying at Paris. Had to try it because I like watching most of the Gordon Ramsay shows on TV. The meal did not disappoint. It was kind of cool/funny that they bring out a cart with all the steak cuts on it for your viewing before you order. There were even little mirrors (think the kind the dentist uses) so you could view the cuts of meat from every angle. Thought that was kind of funny. Anyways, on to the meal.   Beef wellington- this is Ramsays go-to and is incredible. Just order it.  Sticky Toffee Pudding- same as above. Not normally something I would order, but it was so good.  Overall, a great restaurant in a city filled with great restaurants. Nothing to complain about, but the service was just OK for a restaurant of this caliber.

Updated review: I was initially very upset after my first visit to Piefection. There was some miscommunication about the availability for a certain type of pie. Cheryl reached out immediately and apologized for the experience. She offered one of the kindest gestures I have seen. The day before Thanksgiving, she delivered two Kentucky Derby pies to my house to make up for the previous visit. Huge thanks to Cheryl, you have made a lifelong customer!  On to the important stuff. The pies were the best that I have ever had. We got two Kentucky Derby pies and two Pecan pies. They were the hit of Thanksgiving and were absolutely delicious. The crust on the pies is perfectly light and flaky. These Kentucky Derby pies were better than the ones from Kentucky, and that's pretty darn impressive. Pecan pies were quite incredible as well. I can't say thank you to Cheryl enough, you really made my Thanksgiving! Absolutely fantastic pies and customer service. I am forever grateful and will surely be back many times.

Best fish tacos on the planet. If you're looking for your standard fried fish tacos, you won't find them here. Everything is grilled, healthy and light. So much flavor packed into these. Only downside is that it is virtually impossible to eat without making a huge mess. Get lots of napkins before you sit down.

Been here for both lunch and dinner. Great rolls, very unique in that they use forbidden rice, which is really good. Favorite is the H3 roll for sure. They tend to be a little heavy handed with the sauce, but still a solid sushi place.

This is our go-to Thai place around our house. They deliver, which is a plus. Have never dined in so I can't really comment on that, but it looks nice. Excellent food and good location.   Some of my favorite things on the menu:  Chicken pad thai- one of my favorite pad thais in the valley  Yellow Curry- very good as well  Word of caution- it seems their medium spice level is more like a hot. It is consistently more spicy than I anticipate.

Really confused as to how this place has such a great rating. I heard it was awarded one of the top new restaurants in the US. Can't understand that at all. Went here for dinner as I like both sushi and mexican food so I figured how could I go wrong.   Food: Started off with the traditional guacamole. It was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. They had a lump crab guacamole as well. In the highly unlikely event that I ever go back, I would try this.   Got an assortment of sushi rolls- Maya roll (tuna + crispy rice), apple salmon roll, rollo chingon (grilled shrimp + guacamole), and spicy crab roll. They also have a billionare roll which is $50 and has wagyu beef, but as I am admittedly not a billionaire, I have trouble believing the roll is worth it. After we order our sushi, this is where our meal takes a turn for the worse. Normally when you order sushi, they bring out your sushi as it is ready. Not the case here. We were starving and it was over an hour before they brought out any sushi. About an hour and twenty minutes after ordering, they bring out all of our sushi at once. With the exception of the rollo chingon (the fusion grilled shrimp and guacamole roll), everything was horrible. The sushi tasted like it had been sitting for quite a while. I honestly am not sure it would have tasted much better if it had been brought out immediately as it was so bad. Fish tasted very fishy and was just plain gross. The sushi was not overly expensive, but still wasn't worth it.   Service- On par with the food, the service was not good. We saw our server four times in the two hours we were there and my water was empty virtually the entire time. Most of my frustration has to do with the ticket times (1:20 for food to come out). It was made worse by the fact that I don't believe we saw our server in between when they brought out the guacamole and when they brought out our sushi over an hour later. No communication.  I must be missing something as there is no way I would be back to this place, but it seems most people rave about it. I am thoroughly confused.

Went here again after Jason P, the manager at Sumomaya, reached out and invited us to come give the place another shot. We were not disappointed. The first visit must have been some kind of fluke because both the food and service were absolutely on point here.   Food: Ceviche del dia- It had a nice acidity, tasted fresh, and was overall very good. Maya Roll- spicy tuna and crispy rice. The tuna was fresh and good quality and the crispy rice was well-balanced. It didn't taste like some crispy rice that I have had in the past where it was overly fried. We also had several nigiri sushi selections and all were fresh, high quality, and delicious.   Drinks: Thai Basil- Rum, lime, thai basil, and pineapple. Money Tamarind- Bulleit rye, tamarind, lime and ginger. Also money  Overall, very nice ambiance, food, drinks, and service. Seems like a great place to go for both happy hour and dinner. Huge thanks to Jason for this wonderful dinner.

This is our new go-to sushi spot in AZ. Not sure how it took so long to go here, but have probably been 5 times in the last month. If you're into rolls, they have some of the best I've had. After coming back from LA and getting hooked on omakase after being to some awesome sushi spots, we were searching for something to fill the void. This is it. Jay serves up the best omakase in AZ and the value is insane. Sit at the sushi bar and have Jay serve you up an omakase meal. You will not regret it.   In terms of the ambiance, I am pretty sure this used to be a Wendy's or Starbucks or something as there is still a drive-through. Doesn't matter. Inside is put together well and Jay told me he's moving to another spot across the parking lot in a few months. Speaking of parking, since it's not in the middle of old town, the parking is super easy and available without having to deal with the normal old town scottsdale drama.   I'm almost hesitant to write this review, as I want this place to stay a (somewhat) hidden gem. That said, Jay is one of the nicest guys in the world and serves up the best sushi in AZ. Whether it's sushi rolls or letting Jay treat you to omakase, this place is leaps and bounds better than anywhere else we have been in AZ for sushi and we go out for sushi basically every weekend. The fact that it is lacking the usual old town snobbery is just icing on the cake.

I have now been here for lunch a few times. Everything is very good,  which you come to expect when you visit an LGO place. I've only been for lunch,  but it never seems that crowded which is surprising. Service is quick and I'd definitely love to try dinner here.   Food:  Crispy Brussel sprouts: nice and crispy,  pairs great with tang of goat cheese and sweetness of apple gastrique. A  Sushi grade ahi tuna burger: seared well. Flavors were good with spice and avocado. Maybe I just prefer a seared ahi sandwich to be a steak,  but the texture of the seared ground tuna wasn't for me. B-  Last time I had the pan fried loup de mer and it was outstanding.   Overall, a great addition the to area. Would love to try dinner, but lunch has been great the three times I've been.

I have been to this location as well as the location in Pacific Beach. It is the best ice cream sandwich I have ever had. I got a brownie top with chocolate chip cookie bottom, filled with cookies and cream ice cream. When they ask you if you want it heated up, say yes! It makes the cookie/brownie warm like it just came out of the oven and the ice cream perfectly soft and a little melty. Great way to consume a days worth of calories in one sitting!

Summary - if you like Virtu, you will like this place.  Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Made a 6pm reservation, but it wasn't really necessary as restaurant was only half full. I have been to Virtu a half dozen times, so I was expecting a similar level of quality and was not disappointed.   Food:  Virtu octopus : I can report that it's just as flawless as at Virtu. Bitter arugula, flavorful chickpeas, perfectly charred octopus, and some good spice. This is a must-order, whether you like octopus or not. A+  Grilled mixed vegetables: Admittedly, this was more of my wife's choice than mine. That said, all the vegetables were prepared and seasoned perfectly. I believe there was eggplant, zucchini, squash, and a few others. There was a weird pickled something in there that we didn't care for, but other than that it was very solid. A  Pesto Spaghetti with Chicken: I added chicken to this dish, which was a solid choice. Basil pesto was fresh and light. Homemade spaghetti had great texture. Chicken was shredded and was easy to eat. A  I ordered a bourbon drink that was pretty good as well, but wasn't anything insanely stellar. Overall, service was pretty good and food was great. This is a very solid addition to downtown Gilbert. I will surely be back.
