I liked my therapist, and I enjoyed the therapy process.  However, they screwed up my billing.  I have spoken with them over A DOZEN times and received (no exxageration) over 75 phone calls from their third party billing vendor since first going in November last year.  Their office is entirely clueless, and despite receiving payment from the insurance company (which I had to handle and arrange because of Physiotherapy Associates incompetence), I still receive two to three phone calls a week.    Do not go here.  There are a lot of great therapist whose offices will not treat you like garbage.

Made the trip to Chars last Saturday for my first time.  Had an absolute riot!  We saw Larry Bailey, who plays there every Wednesday as well.  Really, really enjoyed it.  It was by no means traditional blues, more a mix of r&b and funk with some classics in there, but the band was rocking.  Great time, great place, I will be back.

I really don't understand how there can be this many positive reviews of this place.  The gyro was sub par, very little meat and the tzatziki was watery.  The chicken schawarma had an odd taste to it as well.  I would rate Gyro Express and the Hungry Monk wayyyy better and they are both within a mile of this place.  Save your cash, go anyplace else.

The best Gyro place in Scottsdale, or Arizona for that matter.  Awesome, awesome food.

Do you like Monsters?  Do you like good beer?  Do you like Burgers?  If so, this place is for you, heck even if you only like 1 out of 3 this place is for you.  Great, great food with an awesome staff in a fun environment.

I had their pot roast sub and it was pretty amazing.  If you're looking for a quick sub or pie that's good, this is your spot.

I wanted to update this review as I have used Insectek for about three years now.  I generally do monthly visits during the summer and quarterly during the rest of the year.  They are always flexible with their scheduling ( I like to make sure I'm home when they come by so I can get the interior done as well as the exterior) and their techs do a thorough job.  I will continue to recommend them to friends and family.

Fantastic, unique ambiance.  Nothing else quite like it.  We took our young daughter here and my wife and I split some wine.  My daughter loved checking out the birds, and we loved the nicely priced wine.    I will take out of state visitors here for sure, at least for a drink.

I am really surprised by the 3 1/2 stars.  The pizza here is as good as you'll find in Italy, and better than Pizzeria Bianco.  The atmosphere is similar to their old location, cozy, but not too quaint.  The wine list is accessible and great, with a number of unique and interesting choices.  Everything is home made, and absolutely fantastic.  This is in my opinion the best restaurant in Tempe, and one of the best in the Phoenix metro area.

They responded quickly to our request for a quote.  They showed up on time, did an excellent job, and their rate was fair.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to friends and family!

Great prices, nice atmosphere, and the food is fantastic.  This is the best Asian restaurant around by leaps and bounds.

This place is disgusting, poorly maintained, and just overall a horrible location.  The pool has been out of service for roughly six months.  The equipment, from free weights, ellipticals, and treadmills, is old and has about a 30% chance of being out of service.  The men's locker room generally has flies on the walls and the showers look like something out of a b horror movie.  I've tried to keep this as my backup gym, but at this point I think I'm better off just running outside.
