Before I knew anything about Roy's, we dined at the Kauai restaurant on our honeymoon years ago. Since then, we have frequented Roy's at this location maybe once a year or so, including a major wedding anniversary.   This place is not cheap--that's no surprise. Portions are not huge, but again, that's standard for this type of restaurant. I LOVE Roy's. It's a special occasion place for us (though their happy hour seems very enticing).   The appetizer sampler for 2 is oh-my-freakin-goodness amazing. It really does just leave you wanting more. And, though nothing too far out of the box, the butterfish is something I crave on a regular basis. So succulent, so delicious. Mouth is watering as I type.   On top of the lovely food, we have always had outstanding, personalized service. Especially if you have a specialty occasion, Roy's goes out of their way to take the experience to the next level. This location in the J.W. Marriott has an elegant atmosphere that lends itself towards after-dinner strolls in a sophisticated environment.   Oh, and did I mention that the martinis are well-made and scrumptious? (The 1988 is my absolute favorite!) Now I just need to check them out at the happy hour price!

Driving down Bell Road, looking for some eatery that was a litlte different than the standard chain nonsense, I stumbled on Thee Pitts Again...  I knew nothing about their DDD rep, etc. BBQ just sounded like a great take-out option for a Sunday afternoon.   Two, two-meat plates later, the hubs and I were happily stuffed on pulled pork, brisket and smoked turkey. Living many years in the South, I appreciate a good pulled pork and theirs did not disappoint! However, the pulled turkey was far BETTER than I ever would have expected! Both were excellent! The brisket was good too, but I've got my favorites solidified.  Sides were good, standard BBQ fare. Nothing to write home about, but definitely provide that comfort food "yum" factor.   Especially due to the extreme lack of good BBQ places on the West side, I recommend this place. A few too many tchotchke pigs inside for me to dine-in, but I'd get take-out again for sure!

I am usually a blackened tilapia and salsa verde shrimp taco girl w/black beans and a crap-ton (technical term) of salsa, but today's $1.50 Taco Tuesday called out to me in an I'm-too-lazy-to-cook-after-work moment. Plus, 2 tacos for $3?! Can't really beat that... though I'm adequately full after scarfing mine down, I stand by my regular choices.   For your own sake, don't order the classic taco as take-out. Within 5 min, the wrapping makes any crispiness soggy. No bueno...but edible.   Verdict: Taco Tuesday rocks, but eat it in-house while super fresh. Otherwise, I still love my standards and they are great, even as take-out. If you are nice, they will give you a slightly larger container or two for the salsa (the spiciest and chipotle ones are my faves).

I can't believe I've driven past here for years and didn't stop by 'til now. The exterior is non-assuming, but upon pulling up, I couldn't believe how packed it was! That's a good sign...  We shared the chorizo burrito and a ham, egg and cheese garlic bagel. Pork lovers unite. Including the one coffee that came with the bagel, this breakfast for two came to $10 total and we were definitely satiated.   The food and coffee are simple fare, but the bagel was amazing and soooo very fresh. In fact, they had so many bagel options to choose from that is was hard to decide! And freshest looking bagels I've seen in the area. (Beware vampires: the garlic bagel is almost overpoweringly strong, but I love garlic so no complaints here.)   Popular Sunday morning place, quick service, good prices, and, most of all, tasty food.

Bland, bland, bland...  I've been here multiple times for take out,  therefore should know better by now.  This time,  the Ma Po tofu (ordered extra spicy) had absolutely zero spice to it, minimal flavor and, other than the large pieces of broccoli around the perimeter,  was nearly vegetable-less. Basically a pile of tofu in bland brown sauce with unseasoned broccoli.  I'll have to use the leftovers to reinvent this dish as something more palatable.   The orange chicken my friend ordered was fine. Nothing to write home about.  The crab puffs should have been called cream cheese wontons with basic sweet and sour sauce. Bleck.    If there were better options in this area, this place would not get such good reviews. But compared to...nothing...it's an edible option for pseudo-Asian food. Maybe. If you really have the yen...

Minus the complimentary salsa trio (quartet, if you count the hot sauce), I'd probably knock Abuelo's down half a star, but I LOVED all of the salsas and our waiter was fantastic. We took a lonnng lunch and ordered the appetizer sampler of dips (all of which were fantastic) and shared a steak and shrimp fajitas for ONE. When the food came to the table I was shocked that the entree portion was truly intended for ONE. Needless to say, we stuffed ourselves, enjoyed a couple adult bevs and still left with two boxes of leftovers.   If we weren't sharing, I think the food would be a bit overpriced (especially for lunch), but it was a nice change and I'll be back.

For our first Ethiopian food experience, we opted for the Lalibela Exclusive - a HUGE sampler of most of their menu offerings. Did I mention how much food this was?! Definitely too much for 2 people (the menu does state for 3+), but we were greedy and indecisive and I thought this was a perfect choice.   We liked everything on the 18+ inch tray, but our favorites were the doro wat (chicken), key sega wat (beef), tikel gomen (cabbage), and misir wat (red lentils).   Their iced teas are yummy and service was informative and attentive! The sampler was pricey, but now that we know what we like we can order more cheaply.   Definitely worth the unique experience. We'll be back!

Oh, Chino Bandido--I do love your irreverent takee-outee. I've sampled most of your dishes and now have my favorites. I fill out my slip with Diablo Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans (extra Emerald sauce).   As much as I love you, your entrees have slipped over the last couple years. The Diablo chicken has been a bit over-fried the last few times and lacking seasoning. The Emerald chicken (white meat, not fried) has been more than a tad dry. I still love you, but shape up, please.   Jerk fried rice is consistent and, as always, yummy (especially with a little extra Emerald sauce mixed in!). The rock stars of the party are those mouthwatering black beans! I could stuff myself to the brim on those puppies.   This DD&D joint isn't just a novelty. It is unique, delicious food in a crappy strip mall environment. No frills, but firefighters also love it (you know that's a good sign!). I'll also always love the complimentary snickerdoodle with every meal.   I hope your entrees are just in a slump and will improve when the next cook takes over...

I love this market for Middle Eastern/Indian food supplies. Pickled turnips, cheap phyllo, spices galore! I'm in heaven. The pastries and pita for sale are equally delicious. I've yet to try the butcher, but will be back soon to hopefully get some high quality halal meat. The best part thus far--eating at the restaurant inside the grocery.  If there was a 4.5, they'd win it...simple cafe inside Baiz Market. I ordered entirely too much food to-go and was not disappointed by the price or taste!! Large hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli (entire package of house-made pita included) + falafel wrap and shawarma wrap = about $30 and is enough food to eat as leftovers for days.   Best of the best was the baba ghanoush. You can really taste the roasted/charred quality of the eggplant and it is balanced perfectly with the tahini. I love the slight chunkiness of the puree that really highlights and respects the ingredients. (Grade: A+++)  The falafel sandwich/wrap was also AMAZING! Great balance of pickles, tomatoes, tahini, etc. Cheaper than the other wraps (though all are super cheap given the quality ingredients, this is about $4) and the staff favorite. (Grade: A)  I asked the gal taking my order what her next fav wrap and followed her suggestion of the chicken shawarma. This was certainly good, but I'll definitely stick with the falafel. (Grade: B+)   Tabouli was also spectacular! I would have preferred a bit more lemon, but was pleasantly surprised that they didn't overload it with bulgar (huge pet peeve of mine). (Grade: A)   Lastly, the hummus is flavored more strongly with tahini than other hummus I've tried from M.E. restaurants, but texture is fantastic and I'm a fan! I'd say it's a standard hummus that won't blow your socks off, but is still certainly delicious. If you are new to hummus, this is the perfect intro. (Grade: A-)  All and all, everything was well worth the trip, money and calories. The large sides fill up an entire full-size to-go box.  I will be back for sure!!

While trying to find a good Camelback Corridor HH restaurant, I stumbled across Ticoz. Lovely patio seating--perfect for late Oct. In Phx and sampled the Taco Tuesday menu. Wanted to try all 5, but felt gluttonous so settled on the chicken tinga, crispy tilapia and carne asada. I typically shy from boring chicken, but the tinga was surprisingly my favorite! The other two were good, but could have used some contrasting flavors to elevate the flavor profile.  However, at $2 per taco, you can't beat it! The sangria was tamely tasty and refreshing, while the guachummus (?) app was equally yummy and unique. I've never met a salsa I didn't like and we even ordered seconds! Service was perfectly attentive, while unobtrusive. Not very crowded at 5:30 on a Tues., but the older gentleman carrying around a whip was quite the random conversation piece. I definitely recommend, especially for HH!

Since it's close, I'll admit the potential sin of a Taco Bell/KFC run or two. We all have our fast food indulgences.   My review is not so much about the food as it is the staff, service and overall management. This store is consistently SLOWWWW (ok, maybe I come here more than I should...). By slow, I mean that the in-store cashier has a line of 6-12 receipts lined up on the counter as they work to deliver food. I ordered a fresco bean burrito and fresco soft taco and waited 20+ minutes (yes, really) for my order.   I most certainly was not the only disgruntled one.   By now, I should have learned my lesson and known to avoid this place like the plague if you have any desire to enjoy the next 30 minutes of your life. I don't know about you, but sitting for that long inside or in the drive-thru for a simple order is just beyond ridiculous. If it happened just once, I'd let it slide. But this seems to always be the case. Hearing the other upset customers while I'm waiting just makes the experience that much worse. At least I'm not the only one...  I'm speculating, but I think it's a cheap management issue where they don't want to hire enough employees for cost, therefore they have poor service. (The signs in the windows about how they will charge extra for sauces and not honor certain standard coupons only reinforces my opinion. But again, just my opinion.) Go to another location.

I deliberated over where to celebrate my birthday dinner and I knew seafood was in order. Especially with the limited fresh options in Phoenix, Pappadeaux's was calling my name. I'd been here once before and really enjoyed it and appreciate how flavorful the creole-inspired dishes are!  We had the crispy fried alligator and shrimp and crawfish fondeaux to start. After living on the Gulf Coast, the alligator was not a "shock" to me as it is to some people and it was fun and tasty. The fondeaux was rich and yummy!   A brief flashback to my first Pappadeaux experience reminded me not to fill up too much on apps, since I ended up taking up most of my entree home. I did not listen to that little voice. We ordered our entrees -- Gulf Coast Redfish Pontchartrain for me and Pasta Mardi Gras for him -- including a cup of gumbo. Our friends ordered their entrees too, including the lobster bisque (YUM! The gumbo was good, but the bisque was GREAT!).   Sure enough...by the time our entrees arrived, I was full again!! Fail for me, because the food was all soooo very tasty! The waitress was amazing and willing to box everything up for us.   And the cherry on top?  Well, Pappadeaux's has a mean birthday brownie a la mode that was HUGE and delicious! Needless to say, I've got enough food for 2 days...  I definitely am a fan of this place, especially among Phoenix seafood options...and though there seems to always be a wait, the courtyard is lovely to hang out in while you wait for a table.

Do you have an experimental side? Do you like to travel, but can't find the time/money? Can you tolerate the smell of fish (for the first two minutes until you get used to it)?  If you answer yes to any of the above, then get your butt to Lee Lee's. Though I probably enjoy grocery stores more than most, upon entering, I'm transported to a world of culinary and cultural possibilities that revs up my gastronomical engines.   Cheap produce with amazing variety, great meat section (one of the only places I feel comfortable buying fresh fish in Phoenix), and just an all-around amazing experience for the ethnic food lover. C'mon now, each aisle being devoted to a region or country?? It's pretty freakin' amazing!   I could spend hours in Lee Lee's lusting after the food porn possibilities. You should too.

This place has a great menu, particularly for breakfast and brunch, that allows you to select from the standards or experiment with something more creative. Omelettes, scrambles, and the southwestern dishes have always been my go-tos, among which, the Old Pueblo (off the South by Southwest section of the menu) is my absolute fav!  Every location I've visited across the valley has great service, food, and ambiance. ANDDD...the Arizona hot sauce at each table is knock-your-socks-off good (try the organic chipotle habanero)!

Wow! I am sooo glad I stumbled across this place! Words cannot describe the excitement. I would have loved to try every single thing, but limited myself to a takeout order of three pupusas (revueltas, loroco, y espinacas y queso), three tamales of mixed variety, and "Salvadoran" guacamole---all for under $20. (No, it was not all for me. And, yes, I do in fact have leftovers from the generous portions!)  I see some other reviews referencing the wait time--it took about 15 minutes for my to-go order and everything was made completely FRESH! I am impressed that they can make such amazing food in that amount of time!   Each pupusa was delicious and flavorful and the tamales were so very unique, contrasting the traditional Mexican variety we get used to here in Phoenix . Even my husband, who doesn't even care for tamales, said these were the best he ever had! The masa, wrapped in banana leaves,  is pillow-ey--like polenta meets mashed potatoes meets heaven. I'm in love. Plus, I could slurp those black beans smoothie-style all day long.   This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem, not too far from Central Phoenix, and though there was a little bit of a language barrier for the novice, the staff was beyond friendly and welcoming-- like being invited into a family's home, with smiles from every corner.   In fact, while waiting for my order after paying, I began asking the gal her favorites that I should try next time. My Spanish and her English were broken and definitely not grammatically correct as we struck up the most genuine conversation I've had in a long time. In her own generosity, she brought me a small sampling of her favorite snack--it was delicious. I can't wait to return.  P.S. I picked up a couple palatas (pina y sandia). Though I haven't tried them yet, they look scrumptious for $1 each. Yum, yum, yum!

Buzzberry is an adorable neighborhood cafe with a wide array of menu items for all! I only wish it was closer to my house! Coffees, teas, all-fruit smoothies (I had the tropical escape and it was scrumptious!), breakfast, lunch and a nightly dinner specials....ooh AND beer/wine, drive-thru and 24 hr service.   Quite frankly, I don't know how they do it all!! (All-natural dog treats, too!)  Though I only had the smoothie, I will absolutely go back to check out their vast offerings. Service was fast and friendly. Free Wi-Fi was easy to connect. Great study/meeting place or neighborhood hangout!

"Flight commander" Dar was a great balloon pilot for our sunrise trip! Rainbow Ryder's took care of everything from beginning to end. On time. On the ball. It was even interesting to see how they figure out just the right launch point for our navigationless(ish) journey.   12 people in a woven basket, lifted and controlled via propane temperatures and breezes...crazy. We loved the peacefulness from above, while even dipping down low (intentionally) to look for wildlife.   After our pretty smooth landing (I was expecting more impact, but was pleasantly surprised), we had a nice continental breakfast with muffins, bagels and scones catered by Wildflower Bread Company. Very good! The champagne, orange juice and cranberry juice could be mixed or served solo as you prefer with comfortable opportunities for refills. Way to go, RR!

Hidden gem in a business area where few good restaurants exist. The Jordanian owners are always very nice and friendly. I love both vegetarian platters (mostly because I appreciate the variety of falafel, baba, hummus, and/or spanakopita), but when in a carnivorous mood, the basic gyro platter is also yummy, though nothing out of the ordinary. The grocery part of the store is fantastic if you're a foodie like me, always intrigued by items not found in the megamart. Affordable Mediterranean staples, like tahini, and decent produce prices too (though quality/availability is hit or miss).   Cons: Tabbouli could have more flavor (more lemon, less bulgar, maybe?), service can be slow if you are in a hurry during lunch.   Overall, worth a trip if you're in the mood for something more authentic in this area of suburban, crappy chain restaurants.

This was my second time eating here (third time visiting, considering that they turned us away one day when they had a private party...not their fault, but still irritating). The first--about 9 months ago--was slightly better than this one, but unfortunately, this trip was so terrible I will NOT be back. After living in Peru for a while, I wanted my husband to experience the food that I did.   We had an expiring "deal" coupon and immediately upon being seated, we were asked about it. The waitress was unpleasant from the beginning and the fact that we were using the deal they advertised seemed to be an inconvenience for her. Meanwhile, we had to sit directly in the sun at a table, instead of in a shaded booth because one of her children had sprawled out across the bench and has no desire to move. Her other toddler child had full run of the restaurant, sucking on cups and walking up to all the guests in the restaurant. COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL.   The anticuchos (heart) were the best thing we ordered, but the portions were significantly smaller than our first visit.   The chicken and rice soup and chicken salad were fine - not worth the non-deal price tag they charge. The cancha snack is good, but I don't come to a restaurant for the "corn nuts."  Hubby ordered the lomo saltado w/mixed meat. The waitress knew she brought the wrong type with steak only, but made no effort to correct the error. At this point, we were already fed up with the service and atmosphere. (Oh, we were seated under the AC duct which brought our food back down to fridge temps within minutes...)  MOST disappointing was my "Pescado A La Menier" - grilled fish with lemon, garlic, and white wine/butter sauce (usually $15). Fish was TINY, sauceless with a notable frozen flavor. The vegetables were frozen peas and carrots and the white rice was just that--white rice. I could have made a TV dinner that tasted better than this and provided more value. I was sooo disappointed, as I'd been looking forward to this all day, reading the menu prior to going hoping to pick out something really good.  The Inka Kola we ordered never came, but was still on the bill. The waitress made us feel like intruders the entire time. Another couple asked if they could order a menu item above the max allowed for the meal and just pay the difference. They were sternly told absolutely not. No customer service.   To their credit, I tried the ceviche on my first visit and it was good, but after seeing how all of the food quality has gotten worse and the service/prices are atrocious, I can't even trust that is still the case and will not be returning.

Ehh...I won't be back. Trendy isn't always bad, but Arrogant Butcher exemplifies trendiness while sacrificing the food + experience factor. With a large group, I had the cioppino ($25--which I was sooo excited about) and a martini (about $9). It was fine. No major complaints. However, it just wasn't worth it.   I definitely splurge on food more than I should, but Arrogant Butcher just left me feeling disappointed. Not because of anything specific, but a general sense of ennui.   Your money can be put to better use elsewhere...

Perfect spot to meet a friend or two for after work HH/dinner. Parking sucks (hence the seemingly odd valet)...or you can just park street-side in the neighborhood while you dine on some elevated American food.   I had the Cheddar Fondue and Porkwich, both of which were reasonably priced and succulent! I'm not a huge eater at one sitting, so there was definitely a large enough portion to take home for a midnight snack.   Just the right amount of menu items means I'm enticed to return and try their other entrees. The Country Vegetable Chopped salad sounds pretty dang tasty!

If you're here for the beer and live music, you are in the right place! (Check in for a free beer sample, too!)  To be fair, I have not eaten food here and have been multiple times in the evening (9-10 PM), but I love the beer selection and, more than anything, the excellent bands they have on stage.   Service is pretty good--waitresses are always friendly and don't mind if we hang out for a few hours with drinks (after all, that's kind of what the venue is hoping for, I'd think). Prices are average. Not super cheap, but not breaking the bank.   The outdoor patio is also great if you want some fresh air--and they have another bar out there so you don't have to keep running inside if you want another round! All and all, a good time.

Can we call it 4.5? Close to home and work, I LOVE Pita Jungle!   No matter what you order (newbie or Mediterranean pro)--it's affordable, plentiful and delicious! I've been for lunch, HH and dinner and I've never been disappointed.   Though I'm an omnivore, the vegetarian antipasto appetizer sampler is my fav and I could eat off this for multiple sittings (if you are there for HH and are going to order vegetarian tapas...you may actually SAVE money by just ordering the sampler app at  about $11).  Lastly, I usually find any main chicken course to be dull and am always skeptical. But the Wood-Fired Chicken is truly delish and I *may* possibly salivate at night for it...

Some familial vegetarians introduced me to this gem (I've no dietary preferences).  Short and sweet...it's extraordinary!  Vegan buffalo wings?!? My military man/carnivorous husband says (guardedly) that these are the best wings he's ever had! And I agree...  Not to mention the "Big WAC", Diablo Red Bowl, or Original "G " Spicy Po-Boy (Buffalo mock chicken).   My soul mourns the fact that Green is far from my house and not open on Sundays.  Those buffalo wings...seriously...they will blow your mind. I want them now!

The cute decor and great customer service set the Polish Room apart from other local nail salons. The staff is friendly and willing to listen to your requests. Even Ben, the owner, is at the store most of the time being friendly with guests and offering bottles of water, etc.   The prices are on par for the area, but the service really elevates this place. I never feel rushed and they have even stayed late without complaint when I unknowingly came in a little too close to closing time. The owner once said in passing that he'd rather have to turn people away if they are too busy than to sacrifice the service they provide to each guest. I respect that and will continue to go exclusively here!

Preface: I'd give this place 2.5 stars if that was an option.   I met the girls for happy hour. I didn't feel like a fussy house cocktail so I ordered my standard gin & soda. Too bad they had no specials for this very basic drink ($8, I think for a single). So I ended up paying a lot more than others with their whiskey lemonades or whatever-the-heck they ordered.   After seeing the array of HH dishes ordered by others, I settled on the Kennebac Potato Fries and Hickman Farms Deviled Eggs. Both were tasty, indulgent snacks. I loved the rosemary on the fries and the generousness of the yolk mixture in the eggs (fork and knife were essential for me and my clumsiness).   The sliders got good reviews as well, though I didn't try them.   Decor was enjoyable. Service could have been better, but we were sitting in the lounge area so maybe they weren't as focused on us (however, it is happy hour in a hotel...I'd think they'd be paying attention, especially during this peak time).  All and all--an okay experience, but I know I am not going out of my way to return--especially as a local. The happy hour just isn't that great of a deal (and I wish they had more food options! Not a great selection and the dinner entrees are $20+). The inconvenience of parking downtown and so-so service just adds to my Blue Hound apathy. I guess if you are downtown it's a fine option.

Especially for airport options, thank god for LGO at Sky Harbor! The delicious margherita pizza was a tad heavy on the mozz, but better to have too much than too little! The pizzeria chop is lovely as well, with a nice balance of healthy veggies and savory (not so healthy) elements. (Hubby and I shared everything and def feel satiated.) Service is quick and informative. As far as airport food goes, this exceeds expectations. Who wants fast food crap when you can wait 10 min for relish real food?   Oh...and $5 glasses of house wine are also a bargain at PHX!

My normal pho place was closed for renovations so I ordered take-out from Angelina's. Friendly enough staff and modern Americanized decor (the Bon Appetit sign was less a play to the French influence in V, rather a convenient purchase from Hobby Lobby...) Still, it seems to be a nice place to dine in and I may have to check out HH.   Ordered veggie crispy roll, pho tai and pad Thai...  Angelina's isn't bad...it just isn't as authentic, nor flavorful, as its other nearby counterparts. I'd rank my dishes as follows: 1) Veggie roll (just plain tasty, but not unique), 2) pho tai (this rare pho was fine, with lots of accoutrements that were its saving grace) 3) pad thai (I wouldn't order again; not bad, just not remarkable...especially for $13).  Don't let my two stars seem like a complete bashing. Angelina's is fine. It just didn't grab me like I'd had hoped. If you've never tried Vietnamese, this would probably be a great starting point...and I mean that in the best of ways!

We came looking to get out on a Sunday afternoon,  while still staying close to home. I was specifically looking for trivia and found out they have NTN (super yay!). Lots of TVs for the sports watchers. I loved the tablet trivia devices (you just have to ask for one).   We ordered the pork ribettes w/Asian sauce. They blew our minds, they were THAT good. Thick-cut, fall off the bone, just wow. I'll be back for those alone ($10). The $7 queso was "meh". Not bad, just not at all remarkable. Service was fine enough, but slow at the end, when you are looking for refills, more food orders, and finally closing out. When the place is fairly dead, there really isn't much of an excuse. (Sorry staff, but that was the main low point.)  Homey interior for a neighborhood bar (brick wall is a nice touch). I hope this place stays in business.  This area needs more non-chain establishments.  Download their app for deals and coupons or check in on Yelp for $5 off. I'll be back!!

Met the hubby for a work-day lunch break here, after another co-worker gave it great reviews. Their location may be difficult to find for someone who doesn't live/work in the area, but the food is worth the trip.   We shared the Kailua Pork (that everyone raves about) and the chicken stir-fry with rice, potato salad and cole slaw.  First of all, the owners were very nice and you could tell they truly care about what they do. They are recently transplanted from Hawaii, so their perspective, I believe, is authentic!   Both dishes were amazing, generously portioned and perfectly priced for lunch. The pork is beyond-tender. I especially loved the sauce for the stir-fry chicken (I believe they use the same sauce for beef, tofu, veggies, etc.). It has a little kick to it and lots of flavor which I love. All and all, both dishes were great and we even had enough for a small leftover meal.  I didn't notice the bento box sampler until after I'd ordered and I think I'll try that next time--a little of each of the sides and your choice of a sampler of proteins. Perfect for me!  All and all, great food, friendly owners (and this beats the pants off that L&L  Hawaiian place off Happy Valley), and good prices.

This is an awesome, quaint artsy restaurant nestled just slightly off the Historic Glendale strip with a casual vibe and truly delicious food.   We visited on a quiet night and had attentive service, since we were the only other guests other than a large family gathering in the center. The number of patrons, however, is no reflection on the food or experience.   We split two, two-taco plates for maximum sampling--chicken black mole, la santisma with shrimp, chicken tinga, and pork pibil...all of which were delicious. The la santisma, loaded with veggies and cheese was the overall winner (and was the one recommended by our waiter). Also, being a mole fan, I was excited to eat a REALLY good mole!   I only wish there was one closer, because I would eat here wayyyy to often. The salsa bar is out of this world if you are a salsa nut like myself. Sooo many options, all for the tasting. Ever had a delish jicama and cilantro salsa? How about the less common radish salsa, which was outstanding? Not to mention the other 10+ salsas on the bar, including a spicy guac. Many of these have quite the kick, so this may not be for the faint of heart.   Lastly, the house margarita was tasty and we both loved the mixed citrus, including lemons, limes, orange and grapefruit. This is not a "knock-you-on-your-a$$" bev, but probably the tastiest mixed drink I've had in a long time. So fresh, crisp and well-made for enjoyment.   I will be making the trip back again and again. Yum...
