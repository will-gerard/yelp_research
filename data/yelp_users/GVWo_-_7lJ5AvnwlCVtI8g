Service was bad food was just ok. The rolls were very poorly wrapped. The sushimi platter was not good. Bush league sushi restaurant. Won't be coming back.

I'm a guy and it's been hard to find a good place in Tempe to get a nice hair cut. Adam did a great job, he was a cool guy, and I got exactly what I was looking for. I'll be getting my hair cut here from now on. Two thumbs up.
