Just a few block south of my townhouse in Scottsdale so I have been eating here for some time now. This is literally a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a beaten down strip plaza and practically next to a laundromat. Strangely enough this lends to the authenticity and ambience of this mexican dive restaurant. I had to try the mole dish since I went to university in Puebla which is where the dish originated. It was pretty good. Over the years I have tried different dishes from the menu and although not everything was to my liking, I can't say it wasn't truly representative of typical Chilango meals found all around D.F. (el Distrito Federal, otherwise referred to as Mexico City). As the name suggests afterall, that is their speaciality.  [Chilango is a Mexican slang demonym for a person born in the Mexico City suburbs or its surrounding areas who moved there. Sometimes it has a negative connotation when used principally by someone from one of the 31 sovereign States of Mexico.]

The restaurant is a little distance from where I am in Scottsdale but was worth the drive. Not a fancy place but comparable to most Jamaican restaurants elsewhere. This isn't Haute Cuisine afterall. Hands down the best Oxtail I have had in Arizona. Ordered it with rice and peas. You get a choice of plantains or vegetables with the meal.The flavor is as good as anything you get in Brooklyn or Miami but a lot more meat on the bones. I washed it down with some jamaican Ginger Beer. I was so impressed that I order the Curry Goat and Jerk Chicken to go plus 2 beef patties and 2 jerk chicken patties. I'll be back.

Waited quite a while to get a table but what the heck, it was the Chinese New Year's Eve and patience is a virtue.  I tried around 10 different Dim Sum dishes and wanted to try more but wished I had gone with at least 2 or 3 other people as it does add up ($$$) plus my stomach can old handle so much. Almost everything I tried was delicious. I am not a big Congee (porridge) drinker so I wasn't too surprised that I didn't enjoy the one with preserved (black) eggs). The Chinese Brocolli with oyster sauce was good but I would have preffered that it was choy sum (my personal fave). The Spicy Salted Shrimps were decent but missing the "spicy" as in "hot/caliente".   The Shu Mai were delicious and so were the Ginger Beef Tripe. I have had better Dim Sum in New York, SFO, Vancouver  and L.A. but for Phoenix (well....Mesa),  this was pretty good. Next time I'll try to russel (?) up some friends to join me.

Well a few hundred yards away from my home I saw a sign at the intersection announcing a new Puerto Rican restaurant. I figured it was probably in that strip mall I have ignored for the past 25 years that I have lived in the neighbourhood. I was right. It is right behind the 7Eleven on the corner and the parking lot was almost completely filled.  So was the restaurant, with a late (2pm) lunch crowd who were almost all boriquas. This was indeed a hole-in-the-wall and when it comes to ethnic foods, thhis is exactly how I like it. When the place is too fancy (outside of a fancy neighbourhood), I always think they are trying to hide sub-standard meals behind expensive decour. Minimalist just as you would find on the Condado, Old San Juan or Rio Piedras. I ordered Tostones al mojo (Freid Green Plantains with a side of garlic sauce) , Yuca al Mojo de Ajo (Cassava sauteed in garlic), Pernil (roasted pork) served with a salad and arroz con gandules (yellow rice with pigeon peas) with a glass of Coquito Unleaded ) a tradicioonal coconut drink). I was not disappointed. The servings were abundant and everything was delicious. The shredded pork was tender and moist and the rice was just right. The Coquito Unleaded however, was diabetes in a glass over ice and that, can be fatal to a diabetic like myself but, since it was so tasty, I asked for a glass of water which I used to dilute it as I drank. I had no room left for the flan which I had hoped to try and ended up getting a carry out container for lots of left-overs. I am so glad to have discovered some caribbean food in the hood. Even if is not jamaican, it's close enough in seasonings and ingredients that it will suffice for me during those moments when I am in need of some comfort food.

Having tried the great food offered at Hot Pot, I decided to give this restaurant a try. I arrived for lunch on a saturday and was fortunate to be the only and maybe first customer for the day so I was able to actually chit-chat with the owner and meet her mother. This was definitely not a Jamaican restaurant and the big mural of Guyana, painted by a sister as well as the menu reflected the name of the restaurant. Beside the usual fare, there was roti and even a rice-bowl which probably alluded to size and nothing asian. My food was brought out by Salvador, the chilango chef who has obviously been trained by the owner's mom. I ordered the Ox-tail as well as the Brown Stew Chicken, both both rice & peas. I decided to get an order of curried goat as well as jerk chicken to go. The portions were impressive and I was already warned that the rice & peas varied according to the peas/beans they chose to use on a particular day. Today....it was great. The ox-tail was good although not as impressive as Hot Pot.  As for the brown stew chicken...well...that's always a staple on jamaican/caribbean menus and I have always avoided ordering it, just because there is nothing in the name that suggests anything exotic or special. I left, still wondering "What is Brown Stew Chicken?". Don't get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the meal. It tasted decent, like chicken should; served in a gravy/sauce which is probably the "stewed"  part of the name, and since I don't really have any references to compare it to,  suffice it to say, I would be comfortable whipping it up on my won after following any online recipe. Both meals were served with steamed & seasoned cabbage which was delicious. I have yet to try the other 2 dishes I purchased which I will eat later today. I was told that they will prepare jerk pork and the guyanese speciality, "Pepperpot" if given sufficient notice. I am looking forward to trying both.  Overall, I enjoyed my meals and plan on returning to sample all the items on the menu.
