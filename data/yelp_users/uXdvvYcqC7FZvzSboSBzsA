I've had a number of very poor customer service experiences with Alaska. I was making a connecting flight in Seattle to Bellingham (45 min flight from Seattle), however, my family had come down to Seattle for the day and we decided I would just miss my connection and drive back to Bellingham with them. WRONG. I called Alaska as a courtesy to tell them I wasn't going to be on the plane, and they told me my returning flights would be cancelled if I didn't make the connection (as in physically sit on the plane). I wasn't asking for a refund on the ticket, I was just saying my butt wasn't going to be in the seat on the Bellingham flight that I had already paid for. Customer service was incredibly rude and unhelpful. By the time I got off the phone with them it was too late to make the connection and I had to pay almost $300 extra to rebook the return flights. It was insane and illogical.   While this is not a reflection of the entire flight crew, twice I've encountered rude and demeaning flight attendants or ticket counter employees which has tainted my experience as a whole. I'll be sticking to southwest from here on out, a cheap flight is not worth the hassle and bad attitudes.

This salon is by far the best I've ever been to... And I have been to a lot of salons. I've never walked away so consistently happy with my cut and color, time and time again. David is a color genius, he's taken me from brunette to blonde flawlessly & was able to fix another salon's brassy color job. Haley does an awesome job on my cut every time. I've never been happier with a salon, you will not regret coming here!!

Love this place! Such a fun workout, it's over before you know it and you'll wish you could do it again. Ive been to at least 5 different instructors classes and have never been disappointed. I just wish I could make it here every day!!
