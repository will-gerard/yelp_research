If it weren't for the chips and salsa we probably would have starved. The size of the portion for the fajitas reminded me of the samples they dole out at SAMs clubs on Sundays to entice you to buy the real thing. The drinks called "swirls" came out plain... What a bunch of false advertising! AND don't ask for extra cheese, because they will charge you a dollar for about a spoon full! Total rip off! There's hardly any music in the place, felt like I was in a cafeteria... Clank clinkity clank!!

My experience at this Verizon location was quick, easy, and fun! Not the words I would normally associate with Verizon stores. I worked with a spunky dude named James! He was so helpful in getting me the right iPhone and accessories for my birthday! He was informative and not pushy at all! I would return to this location just to work with this extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly sales associate! Party on!

This was the most unorganized, hectic, and ridiculous experience I've ever had at a Rubio's, or at any eatery for that matter. I was picking up a catering order, which should have been ready at 11:30...With all of the confusion between the staff & the kitchen, in regards to multiple orders; it was obvious by noon that my order had not even been made yet. One of the employees was literally running back and forth, frantically delivering food to people's tables inside the restaurant. Meanwhile, a line of people piled out the door about 20 deep. The ice machine was out of ice for a good 15 minutes while I was waiting there for my order. This place was a mess. No system, no organization, and no communication between the staff in the front and the kitchen. I finally got my order, 50 minutes after it should have been ready. It's safe to say that I will never go back to this Rubio's & my office will most definitely not be making a huge catering order from them again, because they couldn't even get it right. With missing items, wrong items, and poorly put together burritos, let's just say it was a bad day for this poorly run Rubio's.

I dont know what's worse... Not being greeted by the grungy boring staff at the bar or paying $8 for 5 quarter size boneless wings...its safe to say i will not be returning to this once great location, as everything has gone downhill since my last visit here.   This is the biltmore for God's sake, you have an image of being a high class establishment in a well to do area. Guess that doesnt matter anymore considering every staff member i saw needed to take a shower and brush their hair.  And when you work at the bar its good to engage with the customers and maybe smile a lil bit.   Also we bought tickets for a movie that surprised everyone as being 3D, when that was not indicated on the tickets we bought. I hate 3D movies because they make me sick and my eyes dont adjust well which makes a lot of the movie hard to watch and out of focus. Also if you want to recline in your seat you might want to rethink that, because you wont be able to see the bottom half the screen because each row is separated by walls that are much too tall. Good luck to anyone who wants a mediocre experience with overly high prices. Never to return!

"There's plenty of idiots that work here."...those were the words of one of them in the flesh. This fellow proceeded to tell me that he couldn't put a new battery in my VW JETTA because the battery was buried under an electrical panel. He said it would take over an hour, even though a different gentleman the night before at the same location told me over the phone they could do it no problem. I called the VW dealership and their service rep literally laughed when I told him what the employee at Auto Zone had told me. So I proceeded to confidently show my "not so complicated battery" situation to Alex who didn't even respond with so much as an apology. In fact, he passed me on to another employee! And thank God! I got much needed assistance from Carlos, who appeared to be an assistant manager. He provided quick and helpful service regardless of Alexander's unwillingness to help me from what I suspect was an acute case of stupidity and laziness. Never going back to this location ever again.   PS this location is in an awful part of town.

Upon first entering the establishment my boyfriend and I noticed it had a rather run down interior that probably wouldn't meet health code with the visible water damage on the ceiling. The only thing to keep us company aside from Asian pop-music videos was the sweltering heat! We got our food to go, only to find out that most of it was too fatty to be edible. Needless to say $45 dollars later we were left with greasy fingers and empty tummies! Never going back!!

This place was great. I called ahead just to get some information, since this was my first time taking my car in for an oil change. Scotty was super helpful over the phone. When I arrived there was fresh coffee in there small but very clean waiting area. The staff was friendly and efficient. They changed my oil for the cheapest price around, I know because I called 6 other places in the area, and they fixed my headlight for free. I was in and out of there in 20 minutes! As a girl who doesn't have all the car smarts, these guys were so nice to take the time to explain everything to me and make me feel more knowledgeable and comfortable about my car and it's maintenance. I will definitely be coming back here in the future! Keep up the good work guys!

Best gym experience! And not just the first time, but every time! They have every piece of equipment you could ever be looking for, and they have such a large quantity that you'll never have to wait for a machine! They offer fitness classes as part of your membership, which is a huge plus. There's pools, basketball courts, rock climbing walls, and even a first class spa! I had my first massage there today and I was blown away! I feel fresh and ready to start the new year! If you're thinking about trying lifetime, I would highly recommend it!

The artists here are amazing, down to earth, and ready to work hard to get you the best and most unique tattoo. The environment is simple and fun, with lots of whimsical signs and amazing artwork to see. I brought my best friend in for her first tattoo and Nick did a great job. Very calm and polite, with impeccable skills and line work! I came back to Nick for my own tattoo! He helped me perfect my design and did an excellent job! The lines are flawless and clean! I couldn't be happier with my experience with Nick and Lady Luck Tattoo!! I would recommend these cats to anyone looking to get some bomb diggity fresh ink!!

It's party city... So you know what you're getting into before you walk through the door! Tons of selections for decorations... Themes for days... And more things then you ever knew you needed for a party! Its summer time so all the beachy, hula stuff is out. I was happy to see that at this location they keep their halloween section open for weirdos like me who always wanna look at crazy costume stuff! The staff was helpful and didn't even flinch when I asked for them to pull something down from the top shelf! There are still some nice kids who work at the party store these days! Yay! This will be my new party city location, as I have not always had such a good experience at the other stores! Party on people!

Good food as always with any jimmy johns... However this one has a history of being extremely slow with delivery. Took 45 mins to get my sandwich this time... So disappointing because they claim to be freaky fast... Guess thats only in the store!

The waitress was on point for how busy it was on a Friday night! However, the wings made my date and I sick! And as neat as the atmosphere there is, it looks like a mixture of every other bar in Scottsdale.

The staff is friendly and the space is clean. Monthly rates are cheap for the lowest level beds, which is all I use anyway. They give lil perks the longer you're there. Got a free spray tan for signing up, and every month since I get some sort of special offer. I think that's a nice way to reward loyal customers. I'm just looking for a cheap place to get some color, not trying to go crazy and bake myself to death, so this place offers exactly what I need. I know they offer a whole lot more, so I would definitely recommend this place!

I experienced my first painting with a twist adventure last night for girls night out! I mean just the idea of sipping on your own wine and getting creative with paint was a dream that turned into a reality for us! The staff was awesome...really funny and extremely helpful for those who weren't as artistically gifted as others! Props to whoever the dj was that night because they had us all jammin out and singing to our favorite tunes!   Great interactive environment! They kept it fun with little contest breaks to take ur eyes off your painting and refresh your creative mind.I got to swing dance in front of everyone with one of the artists, Jeff, and won a painting from their "prize wall"... After two hours of fun we had created fabulous paintings that we were all proud to take home! The only turn off was when the instructor wrapped up the evening with, "hey we're on yelp, go and write us a review!" As an active yelper I will leave the biz with this word of advice...Praise should be earned not asked for.
