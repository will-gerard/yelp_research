Great organization, rarely have to wait in lines, nice people and free wi-fi.  Out of the airports I fly into this is by far the best. Still only 4 stars because you may be great - but airports are still somewhat of a hassle!

Had an amazing dinner (7 course tasting menu with the enhanced wine paring).  Went with the tuna but my date substituted for the venison, both of which were excellent. The sommelier really knew what he was doing.  I think aside from the food being beyond wonderful, the best part was at the end my car was pulled up front, keys in the ignition with a thank you note on the dash and two bottles of water.   Really nice touch.  I don't think I'll ever go somewhere as delicious!

Just wanted to agree fully with Bill (the other reviewer) for his review regarding the event 'Beat the Heat Winterfest'.  I don't understand why this event wasn't canceled when it was so hot with no AC at the facility.  An incredibly disappointment.

Love Atlas. Creative, local food. Menu is always changing.  Only strange thing is the location. Its funny to take people there in the weird strip mall (you know, next to the weed and gun shop) and then have such an excellent experience.

I've gone to a lot of places before finding a salon I liked.  I tried everything Groupon and LivingSocial had to offer to find the perfect person to so my hair and its through this I came across Ami Salon.    Ashley does a great job, she's amiable and I've never had anything close to an unpleasant experience here.  Also a cut and highlight is at a completely reasonable cost.  I highly recommend this place as long as your not competing with me for an appointment!

Booked with very short notice a small move (well what I thought was small - likely closer to medium). Roger called very quickly to schedule and we got the move done on Saturday. Chris and Clinton were incredibly professional, efficient and pleasant to talk to - would highly recommend!

This is my favorite nail salon in Phoenix.  The staff is really great (owners usually working and very nice).  Semi private rooms for pedicures and this is the only place that can get my nails right.  I haven't been sneakily up-sold at other places that I used to go to which I really appreciate. And most weekends they have a masseuse who does neck and shoulder massages for a reasonable cost.    There's a discount too if you pay with cash.

Usually I would just drive on by since it's hidden in a strip mall with a gas station and a dry cleaner but oh I'm so happy we didn't. The menu keeps to the basics - a few benedict's, omelets and of course a breakfast burrito and in keeping it short they really do a delicious job on what they focus on. I love the cheese and herb omelet. The potatoes are well spiced. The nice thing about this place is portions are small so you don't leave breakfast hating yourself for the rest of the day.   Only drawback- there's only ~5 inside tables  but if you find yourself waiting, it'll be worth it.

Loved it.  Got right into my space, was handed a card reminding me of where I parked (its like they know me!) and was promptly taken to my terminal.  On return, didn't have to wait more than 5 min.  The driver was polite and friendly and for those times I just can't get a friend to take me, I'll definitely be parking here.

This was my first time and like most of the Fox restaurants, the food was delicious.  Had the quinona chicken salad, flourless chocolate cake (well a bite or two) and one of the non-alcoholic juice beverages.  Very pleased with the experience and great price point.

Extremely disappointed.  The desk staff wasn't friendly, didn't greet me when walking in and then I had to ask for a beverage (not offered).  The person doing my hair complained about life, the business, people of Arizona and most importantly failed to mention the $10 up-charge for using a curling iron.  Was really looking forward to something relaxing, representative of the advertising and it felt like a waste of time and money.  Since my appointment on April 16th (using a Groupon which was marked used on the 17th) this all might have changed but for the time I was there for my service this was an accurate description of my experience.

This is my all time favorite place in Old Town.  Great food (try the chopped salad for something light, or the short ribs if you had a good workout recently), creative drinks with super friendly bartenders and overall a good vibe.  This is my go-to place for visitors or work events.  Highly highly recommend.

Very much liked the experience here and what a great alternative to the resort pools.  Good music and good bartenders.    Scene is a bit young and Affliction/tap-out prone but not sure what else one would expect!  Still a great time.

Got the chicken caesar and the chicken came out pink. Grossed out about the whole thing and not like I have a reason to go back (its a bit out of the way) but now that's what I think of. Beer was alright, nothing special.

I was really looking forward to the opening and then was really disappointed even after giving it a couple tries.   The good thing is the beer list is one of the better ones in Arizona for the place (beer list at Papago is good but not my scene), that's the one good thing.   First try:  I got the kale salad with chicken. The kale was gritty (like it wasn't washed gritty) and not softened (I know its tough but usually you soften it for salad).  Felt like it was just taken out of the bag and put on a plate with some chicken out of the fridge (yah, chicken was cold). I mentioned something to the bartender who then tried to explain how kale worked to me and felt just really condescending/restaurant egoy (not a word but getting a point across). The good about  the food that day was the pretzel was good but that's hard to screw up.   The second time, went back for lunch.  Asked for a sporting event to be turned on and the bartender turned the channel, but then for her friends when the basketball game came on she turned it for them. Was a bit strange since she did it without asking.  Service was spotty and we had one drink and left.    I don't think I'll be returning, between the service and the so-so food, I wasn't as impressed as I really wanted to be.

Pros: Good hours. The amount of 'tech' in the office is appreciated as it seems to save time. Really liked Dr. Dombo. Listened, provided feedback and understood my concerns.    Cons: Its good to see multiple providers since its not certain you'd get the one you want so in rotating through them I found that the other provider was not someone I personally found comparable to work with during my pregnancy. She would refer to tests I hadn't completed (and not believe me or hear me when I said I didn't), she said I gained too much weight since my last appt (not realizing it had been more weeks than the standard number) and overall rather than giving me options, told stories from her residency about why I should do certain things rather than giving me pros and cons (i.e. someone died of the flu during her residency so one should definitely get a flu shot). I didn't feel treated with respect by her and at 33 weeks have switched providers. (After doing this I've heard at least one other story of this particular doctor being a challenge). Overall she doesn't seem very passionate about helping women and is going through the motions (I get it but I work a desk job, she's bringing life into the world).   Though I really liked Dr. Dombo I don't want to risk having to be with this other provider.

Showed up on time, friendly service and the windows look really great! Incredibly responsive (called yesterday and showed up today).  Highly recommend!

Not terribly impressed with the food (the pretzel is great but I've had the chicken burger and salad and it was eh). It's very loud and the service is spotty (we had terrible service at the bar and a great server at a table). Only going back for good releases but we'll definitly eat elsewhere.

The short of this is I don't think I would have been as successful or as confident breastfeeding without the help of Amey. She's kind, patient, a great communicator and teacher and has a strong network of resources available.   Amey came to my house when I started struggling with BF (as a recommendation from our doula and she was also my nurse at Banner Del Webb), gave me some tips on how to improve (it was really painful) and weighted my daughter to basically check if she was getting what she needed in the first place (she was!). Also mentioned that I might want to get her tongue and lip tie fixed which would help a great deal (we did, on another great recommendation).  My daughter is 4.5 months old and still EBF!   She's highly responsive (texts, emails etc) and also of note, can provide consolidated billing since lactation consultants are, thanks to ACA, covered by most insurers.
