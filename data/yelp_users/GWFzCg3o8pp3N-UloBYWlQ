What a whirlwind of a place.  I took the time to print and fill out the new patient forms from their website, only to find out the forms are current.  Awesome waste of my time.  The doctor spoke in medical terms I didn't understand, I had to keep asking her what she meant.  There are so many people coming and going, a literal turnstile of a place.  Which wouldn't be bad if it didn't feel like a turnstile of a place.  And the entrance door could use a treatment of WD-40.  That door open and closed dozens of times while I was in the waiting room - so loud and creaky.  Speaking of waiting.  I wasn't seen by the doctor until 45 minutes after my appointment time.

Clean place, friendly people, great prices (the top level pedi package is $45).  I described the design I wanted for the manicure, and the artist immediately knew what I was talking about and pulled up an image on her phone to show it to me (burberry).  She did a great job creating the look I wanted. I finally found my mani/pedi home. Bring cash for the tips.
