4 stars for tradition, 2 stars for food quality and 1 for service. The female bartender that took our lunch order had ZERO personality. They make you pay up front for your food. Every time I said "Thank-you" to the bartender, she replied with "No Problem". I'm glad it wasn't a problem. I'd recommend drinking here at night, but not eating.

I've been coming here for over 20 years only because the location in convenient. The service has never been worse, very slow. Upon arriving, you are subjected to high pressure sales techniques to upgrade service. Then the cashier(I think the owner) never cracks a smile or says thank-you. The other owner (maybe the husband of the cashier) treats the employees like slaves. The employees that actually do the washing are hardworking people, so I always tip heavily.  Otherwise I will probably continue to come here because it is convenient and I haven't found other good car wash options in Tempe.

I've been coming here for 26 years. The service is always great and the food can't be beat. This is old school Italian!

This is your home town cleaners.  The staff usually remembers my name and they are always friendly.  I haven't check around to compare prices, but the price that I pay always seems fair.  It is also in a super convenient location.

I was pleasantly surprised with my first visit to see Dr. Ahn.  I have had a couple of bad experiences with dentists, but I am here to stay.  Dr. Ahn was friendly and spent the entire appointment with me.  My last dentist recommended $4000 worth of work which I declined and started searching for a new provider.  One year later my teeth were fine and Dr. suggested "Keeping an eye" on a couple of trouble spots. It is a relief to find such an honest and caring dentist.

I've been using this shop for over 10 years. They are professional, fast and honest. There is frequent communication from the time you drop off your vehicle until you pick it up. I have referred several of my friends here and they have been pleased.

Everything here is great: customer service, parking, healthy brands, accessories, and more. Stop going to Petsmart now and start going there. You will not be disappointed.

This is a good little family Mexican restaurant. They had a Spanish radio station on in the background, the waitresses are friendly, low prices and the portions are big for the price. The atmosphere is very casual so if you're looking for a fancy place this is not it.

I like this Gym.  The building, including the pool area, is larger than other 24 Hour centers.  It does need a make-over.  The locker room is all original tile that was installed when the gym was built as a "Q" in the early 90's.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.

Being from out of town, we had to check this place out. I ignored the mediocre reviews and paid the price. The food was average at best. The two guys working couldn't care less if we there or not. Cash only! I noticed throughout Pittsburgh many "cash only" establishments. I understand avoiding taxes, but these places are also avoiding a lot if potential business. There are many better restaurants, believe the other reviewers that this dive is not special.

Best place in Tempe to get your Sun Devil gear, beer, cigarettes, fountain drinks and everything else that you may need. Perfect stop before a Sun Devil game!

I haven't been to this restaurant since they moved away from Mill Ave several years ago.  Everything was very fresh and good.  I think the owner was our waiter and he was genuinely gracious for our business.  We both had the homemade lentil soup and it was awesome.  The hummus was also very good.  We will go back very soon.

This has to be the best entertainment area in Arizona. Lots of bars, restaurants and shops. There seems to be more offerings for anyone under 40, if not under younger. Fun day or night, but wY different late night. Parking is easy.

This place is now called Jacksons. I would not recommend going here. They are understaffed and overworked. The quality of the car wash is very poor. I was yesterday and was so disappointed that I need to find a different car wash today for them to finish the job.

Good, fresh and affordable Vietnamese food.  Owner and chef, Jimmy, takes pride in his menu.  The waitresses and friendly, helpful and efficient.  I had soup and a coconut juice to drink.  I'll go back soon!

I actually live nearby and "hike" this mountain several times per week. It is designated as a desert preserve and is located in the heart of Downtown Tempe. It takes about 15 minutes of moderately difficult walking to get to the top. from this pinnacle you can see all of Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale. It is known locally as "A-Mountain", the "A" represents Arizona State University (ASU). It is a nice break for tourists and locals alike

Options in Terminal 3 are limited, but skip this one. Service was super slow and not very friendly. I ordered the chipotle bacon chicken sandwich & it wasn't very good. The chocolate chip cookie was pretty tasty

You can't beat this place for low prices and helpful salesmen. It is rare to find a locally owned independent store like this. I highly recommend!

Don't switch to Cox Business! Whatever savings they are promising you will be list 10 times over with correcting the mistakes made by the installers. Wait time on the customer support line is typically 25 minutes. Don't listen to the slick salesman, they will lie to get your business.

First, this place reeks of being a national-chain-franchise-type restaurant.  The staff is trying to be enthusiastic like they have been instructed, but it feels very fake.    Otherwise, the burgers are good.  As you have heard, the standard burger contains two patties, the smaller version has one.  The fresh-cut fries were excellent, maybe the best in Tempe.  We may go back, but probably won't go out of our way.

Employees are rude, slow and indifferent.  Good and drinks are expensive and poorly made. There are so many better choices on Mill, avoid this one.

I've been here many times and always enjoy consistently good food and service. The assortment of TV's is the best. Nice patio for people watching on Mill Ave

I've been here many times and the service gets worse. I sat at the bar for 10 minutes while 2 bartenders avoided eye contact before I finally yelled out for my drink order. These chicks don't give a crap about providing good service. Lauren, doesn't care at all about serving the patrons, the management should tell her that eye contact matters and the customers are ultimately providing her paycheck. Sad.

This is a nice clean and organize store. The employees were friendly and helpful. I use the dog wash, it cost $14.99 and they provide shampoo, towels and brushes. I would recommend the store for pet products as well.

I live and work in the area and I'm so glad that Orange Table is now in Tempe instead of Scottsdale. My favorite breakfast is the Green Flannel. It's sort of a corned beef hash on steroids. They have full table service and the staff is super friendly. The patrons are an even mix of ASU students, faculty, locals and tourists. You can go wrong with this restaurant!

I live nearby and decided to order for delivery. I used the Yelp app to order and it was easy. The delivery was faster than quoted and the food was piping hot. We ordered Jalapeno poppers...fantastic! and a meat combo type pizza that was extremely good. I've lived in the same house for 18 years and haven't found a "Go to" pizza delivery joint. Now I finally have one. Thank-you Zesty Zzeeks!

Just like in the Midwest. Great food and service. They even offer dog biscuits at the drive through window if you have your dogs in the car. Everyone is super friendly!

I approached this place with pessimism . Because how can we possibly have another breakfast joint in Downtown Tempe? Well, it is really good. I have a made to order sausage, peppers and cheese omelet with a side of bacon...frickin' awesome. My guest had Steak and Eggs....it was huge and also very good. I will be going back soon!

Great food truck experience. I stop by on Food truck Thursday's at ASU. The service was fast and friendly and the pizza was extremely good. I ordered the Spicy Sausage and it was done perfectly complete with the wood fired taste. BTW, they have a full blown wood burning oven within the food truck. They also offer reasonably priced waters and other beverages.

This is a great destination in downtown Tempe. The menu is limited but has amazingly tasty choices. Try the bacon wrapped dates! Also the wings are very good. Great beer selection! There is lots of bicycle parking in a parking structure for cars adjacent to the bar. It is located next to the AMC movie theater, so it's a great place to go before a film. The hostess and servers are fast and friendly. There is a large outdoor beer garden with plenty of seating and there are games like ping pong and bags.
