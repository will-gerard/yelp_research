Drove to this place from Litchfield Park 1 1/2 hr round trip good prices and great food made it worth it. As soon as you walk thru the door you feel like you've been sent through some sort of time warp back to Old Time Chicago. From the Deli style counters to the booths for dining in this is a great date spot. The staff was helpful and friendly which made me feel very welcome and at home.  The only negative because well nothing is perfect is that no one welcomed us as we came in and it was mildly awkward figuring out where to place a take out order. Yet that still dims in comparison to my experience. Shout out to @Fox10 news you hit it out of the park with this recommendation!

This place has the absolute best sushi and so many choices. Kinda expensive tho. Ignore the yelp menu prices as they are not accurate!!

Food is pretty fair but more inconsistent than good tasting their customer service/wait staff lacks a sense of urgency. Extremely poor in that category. Too many good Mexican food spots in Az/ west valley to waste ur $ here hoping to b served. Did I mention the terrible phone in order system it's ridiculOus if u even get them to answer pray they make ur order correct. Seriously move on if u think about coming to bibianos (lower case on purpose)

Bomboba is the BOMB simply put.. The Thai tea blended is my fave Ive had it many times. Although it does depend on who makes the drink for maximum goodness. Plus the frequent Bomboba drinker punch cards are an awesome incentive. Look forward to trying somethin new soon..

For as McDonald's goes this 1 taste great food always looks like the commercials well at late night. It's the only time I go but the people r awake willing and ready. The restaurant is still open after midnight not just the drive thru and importantly it's always clean. Rita 1 of the managers there is always bustling back and forth to serve the late/early dinner crowd. Only reason I didn't rate higher is well it's still McDonald's
