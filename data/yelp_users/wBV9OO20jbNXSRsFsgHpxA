Been here twice, once for lunch and today I tried their breakfast.   They have very friendly staff and fresh ingredients.  Salsas are on point and they provide free chips.  Quality spot

Really disappointed with this place recently.  I used to go to the one in Gilbert all the time when I lived/worked out there and was happy to find this location when I moved to Tempe, but the past 2-3 times I've gone I've been really let down.  Like other reviewers have noted, the staff here is far from friendly, but that doesn't play a role in my review.  The food always outweighs the service in a place like this, but my bacon breakfast burrito I ordered this morning had about 90% potatoes and was super greasy.  If it was my first time going there I would never give them another chance.  Having said that, after being let down the past few times I doubt I'm going to go back.  Maybe they changed cooks in the back or something but the food is nowhere near as good as it used to be

Stopped for lunch with a coworker and we were both very impressed.  I had the #6 with a fish taco, Carne Asada taco, and beans and rice.  Everything was on point.  Fresh and flavorful all around.  My bien

This place was recommended to me by a friend and I'm extremely grateful.  All of the breakfast and lunch dishes I've tried were delicious and very reasonably priced.  I believe it's family owned and the staff is always super friendly.    $5 breakfast sandwiches come with a side of hashbrowns and they have a huge bowl of fresh fruit for $5.  Also keep an eye out for their specials.  Basically everything here is good

I paid $10 for the worst and most expensive breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Microwaved eggs and a tiny amount of rubbery bacon wrapped in a terrible tortilla... not even the salsa was decent.  Flavor and texture of the burrito were awful, avoid this place for sure
