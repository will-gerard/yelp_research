I'll have to say, I've never been disappointed with anything I've ever gotten though I have to skip eating for the next few days to make up for it!  Not the healthiest stuff in the world!

To tell you the truth, I'm never disappointed here or the one in Phoenix.  Always a special treat to eat here.

Good place for a greasy burger.  It's loud, loud music and loud kitchen but it works.  Good atmosphere!

Place is nice, staff is nice but a bit rehearsed.  Always eager to take your trash.  Should come up with better system to bring your food out. Sandwich is kind of bland and not as tasty as places like Potbelly or even Quiznos though better than Subway.
