It takes a lot for me to leave a negative review. I also have had positive experiences at discount tire before this. About a week ago I purchased four new tires. When they were finished installing they told me to take this paper and go to a brake shop without even telling me what the issue was. I took it to the brake shop and they said they were told a stud had fallen through but the problem they stated to me was that 3 lug nuts were missing and one was the wrong size so they would have to charge me for doing that or I could go back to discount tire and tell them what the brake shop had said. So I returned and discount tire said they didn't have the parts in. I ended up getting the three lug nuts from the dealership for a small fee and they stated the wrong sized stud was torqued too tight and will probably break. They advised me to go back to discount tire to tell them this. Well today I got a flat tire on that same tire and took it to the Gilbert location. They sent me to a different brake shop because they stated they couldn't fix the tire without first fixing the stud. So now I am waiting for 2-3 hours to get the stud and tire fixed. I am shocked that a specialist in tires would not realize they missed putting 3 lug nuts on and I STILL don't understand why they would put on the wrong sized stud in the first place. This has caused me 2 weeks of stress and time and also money. I would caution anyone to avoid this particular discount tire.

I needed a move out clean kind of short notice and hired Wave House Cleaning. It was easy to schedule an appointment. On the day of, the cleaner was a bit behind but they called me in advance to let me know so no problems there. Jamie was professional, quick and thorough! Was my second time using this company and would use them again!

Not only is Reese one of the nicest people you will ever meet, she is an amazing hairstylist. I went to her originally a couple times when I was unhappy with my hair stylist at the time. She would always fix the cuts that person wasn't doing correctly. I hesitated to switch over because I didn't want to be disloyal, until I got a terrible haircut from my old hairstylist that has just now started to grow out and look good again. She is an amazing colorist. She has slowly gotten me back to an amazing blonde that I love and suits my skin type. She also is always the most concerned with getting and keeping your hair healthy and will be honest if she feels something will jeopardize the health of your hair. She is very considerate and will do anything to make sure her clients are happy. You can tell she is extremely talented as I constantly witness multiple other stylists come to her for advice. The only thing I would say that might be seen as a negative is that she seems to have a lot going on at once. Since she books her own appointments, and will always squeeze someone in for a touch up or if they aren't happy, she seems extremely busy most of the time and is multitasking. All I can say is I am finally loving my hair again! I highly recommend.
