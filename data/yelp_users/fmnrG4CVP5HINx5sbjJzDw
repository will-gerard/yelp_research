Food was not worth the price at all. We waited 25 mins for our bill to come. Our waitress had 2 tables. We watched as the managers went to multiple tables to check in who had just been sat. No one can over to us at all. Not worth the drive to get here at all.

I came in for lunch today (8/31) and had great service! The waitress was very attentive and the manager was very sweet.  The manager came over to see how everything was and made my children feel apart of our conversation. She asked them about their food and you could see how great that made them feel. It's nice to see a manger stop by and check in with all of the tables. I think this location should be very happy they have such a sweet manager who makes sure your customers are happy.

We have been coming to this Zipps for awhile now and never have had an issue. Tonight that all changed. The food was awful. The nachos were soggy. Normally  with nachos the chips have a bite to them. Tonight the chips were so soggy you had to eat them with a fork. A manager after hearing and seeing how the nachos were asked if they  went cooked enough?!? What? Not cooked enough I could not imagine if they were cooked any more. My kids ordered the pizza and quesadilla. The pizza was hard and the quesadilla was extremely greasy (see picture). Thinking next time we are feeling Zipps we will just go to Goldie's instead.

We had such a fun time celebrating my husbands birthday!  I did not think I would really like this type of thing but after going I can't wait to go again. We did the four tune teller and it was awesome. We completed the room with only a few minutes to spare. It made us think outside the box and really work together. I can't wait to go again and try out another room. The staff was amazing and made it so much fun!
