Certainly some of the best bbq I have ever eaten! Juicy, fresh, absolutely made with love. You can tell the cook loves what he does. The hospitality is fantastic and it's a great environment for all bbq lovers out there to bring the kids and get lost in the flavors of Chicago style bbq. Tom's rocks!

The food here is always delicious, hot and fresh. The service however, is hit or miss sometimes and today it was a miss. Cassie was a terrible server. 0 personality, 0 service, 0 cares. We sat for 10 minutes as we sat down without bread or drinks. Finally, got drinks and that was the only one you got for the meal. I asked two other servers for help with bread, drinks, salad, and to go boxes with our server Cassie no where to be found. Never cleaned the table and had piles of dishes at the end of our meal we had to work around. It's a shame because the atmosphere is nice, food is great but with service like that I would think twice about coming in next time.

This is a gem of eatery. Fresh southern style seafood with live music and great drinks. Went there on a Friday night and wasn't too crowded. The service was quick and responsive. Great acoustic live act playing that helped set the scene. Would definitely go back for sure.

Excellent excellent service. Extremely friendly and willing to help you. Never felt pressured or scamed, very upfront and wanting to make sure they get your car fixed then just taking your money. I got my full brake system redone and they did a fantastic job of getting everything switched out and complete within just a couple hours. They also gave me an estimate on some other things that could be fixed in the future that they service. Well worth the money. Certainly would recommend them for your basic car maintenance needs.
