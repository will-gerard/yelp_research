Okay, I love Houston's even though it's a chain. I travel about 90% of the time with my job and Houston's consistently has good food, clean restaurants and great service (I don't understand why all restaurants don't follow their service mantra...where every server takes care of every table...you never have a dirty dish sitting on your table or want for anything for more than 5 minutes.) It is safe to say I'm probably Houston's number one fan! (Just ask my friends who know Houston's is going to be my first suggestion as the place to go eat.) I frequent the 24th St & Camelback location in Phoenix the most. "T" the hostess is absolutely terrific. I ALWAYS feel special when I go in there. All of the food is good. I love the smoked salmon or spinach dip as an appetizer. And the Ahi Tuna salad, the French Dip and the  chopped chicken salad are incredible. I try and make it in to the restaurant on Thursdays for their Chicken Enchilada soup which rocks! Finally, their Sundae is the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make a choice between that and their key lime pie. I have a few complaints about Houstons, I don't like their tea or lemonade very much. Lemonade is too sour and the tea tastes artificial. I'm also bummed they don't have a blender in their bar for frozen margaritas. Perhaps it's because of the noise, not sure? The ambiance at the place is always relaxing. Portions seem to be getting smaller and prices have gone up (like everything else) so bring your wallet.

I really like the ambiance here for breakfast but the service is TERRIBLE and they are always out of staple items, like English Breakfast tea.   I had a morning business meeting breakfast here, paid the bill and tipped 20%. I asked for more tea and got charged again, okay, fair enough. I paid the additional bill but did not tip again on the $2.50, the waiter followed me outside and confronted me about why I didn't tip again on the second bill as I was standing with my client. Tacky.  Also, they need to step up the menu.  The menu is limited and not prepared very well, which is a shame, because it has a great Euro Cafe type of environment.

If you like hummus, then this is the place for you.  Super casual, Pita Jungle has a good mix of young and old patrons. On any given day you'll see students, executives and seniors. The ambiance is uber casual with concrete floors, upbeat music, and an outdoor patio. The servers are young and some look like they just came in from the pool! That doesn't mean the service is bad, exactly opposite. I have had good service every time I've gone in there. The menu is varied including hummus with chicken, lentil soup, pizzas, pita sandwiches, Greek salads and on and on. They also have a thirst quenching Arnold Palmer (lemonade and iced tea.) They are generous with their portions and are always cool with giving you a "to go" cup drink. (Almost a necessity in Arizona summer 100 degree temps!) Don't forget to try the baklava and pistachio ice cream for dessert..Yum! if you are looking for good food in a casual environment then this place is for you.

Dale and his family at Flooring America/Chandler run their business the way I wish all businesses were run.  We had a major remodel including both our bathrooms, entire flooring in our 2100 sq. ft. house, kitchen upgrades etc. Work included a full tile shower install in both MBR and guest bathrooms, tile in the kitchen island and back splash and tiling and hardwood for our floors.  That was about eight years ago.    The work and customer service was stellar then and it is stellar now.  (Wow, a  company with an awesome track record in Arizona...who knew?) We have had several repairs that needed to be done within the eight years and Dale and his family have been there promptly to take care of the situation and WITHOUT QUESTION.   Flooring America is a franchise, so I can't speak about the other locations.  I can tell you unequivocally that Dale's Flooring America in Chandler is top notch.  They will get our future work along with my highest recommendation.   So nice to find a company that goes above and beyond.  Thank you Dale and Family.

All three Havana Cafes are terrific! I mainly frequent the Chandler Blvd. location, although the Camelback location rocks too (Love the wait staff!). The food is wonderful. This is not Mexican food! Last I checked, Cuba is a country unto itself folks! Here's my suggested selections if you are a first timer: Frituras de Fritjoles Negros or as I call them black bean fritters. They are served with a delicious avocado type dip. The tamale is another favorite. My friends love Havana's Calypso Chips. Ok, this isn't Cuban food, but their french fries are also a delicious appetizer. I usually drink their passion fruit ice tea. For my main course, I love the Polla Cubano...chicken marinated with lime, orange, garlic and sauteed with onions! There is a lot of onions, I kick off most of them to enjoy the flavor and the sauce. The dish is served with black beans atop of white rice and plantans. My dining partner loves the Pollo Ajillo which is chicken pieces sauteed with garlic, mushrooms and tomatoes along with Ensalada de Palmito which is a salad with hearts of Palm and a lime and garlic dressing. I sometimes get the Ensalada de Sevilla salad beforehand which is lettuce, orange slices and Spanish onions and avocado with citrus vinaigrette. Usually to follow up for desert we have rice pudding or their awesome coconut flan dishes. The wait staff is terrific (they had a girl in the Chandler location that was terrible, but she's gone now. Might explain the review from Dottsy Z. complaining about slow service. ) Nice ambiance and they also serve a mean Mojito, so check it out!

If you're hungry, then the Black Forest Mill is for you. Just by its nature, German food is filling (think that feeling after your Thanksgiving meal!) I made the horrific mistake of ordering too much food the first time I went with friends. We ordered appetizers of potato pancakes and sausage and sauerkraut. I had saurbrauten which was incredible. The second time I was there I had goulash as my main entree, the goulash was way too salty. I would have loved it had they cut down on the salt. The red cabbage was so good and sweet as was the sauerkraut. I also enjoyed the cherry's jubilees crepe with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Unfortunately, the young woman that was serving us both times wasn't very good. It detracted from the meal and some folks weren't that anxious to go back.  If you can deal with a server that isn't very receptive and is consistently slow, you will be rewarded with some authentic German food (which I think is hard to find in Phoenix.) Prices seemed in line for what was offered and they had German music and dancing on the weekends. The bar was packed both times I was there. I'm guessing they have a good happy hour.

As a foodie, I was disappointed with my experience at J. Alexanders, primarily because of poor service. It really felt like our server (#71) was better suited for a Denny's then a restaurant competing in the high end restaurant space of Scottsdale.  We felt rushed, had very litte description of the food and little or no pleasant interaction.  We both felt like every time we asked about something or for something, we were annoying her.  The food was ok, but not great for the money.  I just kept thinking about Houston's across the street.  The restaurant ambiance is very nice.  I think this would be a great place for a drink or dessert out on the patio, but that's it.  My guest had been at the restaurant once before and had poor service that time as well.  It's a drag, because I wanted to like this restaurant, but for the money, foodies will probably not be that excited about the experience.

I had recently purchased a 2000 BMW 528i.  After buying the car I noticed a gas smell.  I immediately brought the car into a BMW dealer for analysis.  Not only did I have a gas leak, but the analysis came back with over $4000 in repairs.  I was in shock.   I had heard from several folks about Babbitt Motor Werks in Tempe.  One of the friends had told me he drove all the way from the West side in Phoenix because no other BMW shop was expert on BMW's like Babbitt Motor Werks.  Another friend told me they did stellar work and were realistic in their pricing.  I took the car into Babbitt, I spoke with Nathan the owner and Dane.  The service was far beyond what I had expected.  The work was indeed stellar as I was told. These guys know their business.  I had such a sense of relief after speaking with them.  They assured me that the things I needed done on my car were normal repairs based on the mileage.    After getting the car back you could tell right away that there were major improvements done.  Dane had detailed out all of the work that was completed and went over it with us line by line.  To say we were really happy with the work is an understatement.  Excellent work, fair/reasonable pricing and good quality customer service...that's all you can ask for from any company you do business with.  Five stars for Babbitt Motor Werks!

Gross food. Everything had been laying around for awhile. Go somewhere else.

Ok, I screwed up.  Set up a business meeting for four people at 7pm at Tommy V's without a reservation on St. Patty's day (I forgot about it, along with forgetting to wear anything green) and during Cactus league/spring training in Scottsdale, Arizona. (From bad to worse.)    What did the manager do at Tommy V's? He found me a great table on the awesome patio and was gracious about it.  Just for that wonderful accommodation alone would be enough...but hold up!  The food was excellent (the eggplant, wow!) the wine and beer selection was great (kick ass happy hour prices) and the service was outstanding (thanks Tyler.)    This was my first time here along with one of my four guests and we all really had a nice time...and don't forget it was a business meeting!  I am looking forward to going again if my experience ends up being like my last gig, it'll be worth it.

The food is delicious (comfort food,) the owners and their son are tremendously kind, and the restaurant is clean and comfortable.    Go to Beaver Choice to relax; this isn't Olive Garden folks, they're not looking to get you in and out in under an hour.  So if you're looking for fast food, go to Wendy's.
