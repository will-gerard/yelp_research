Got here last minute at 10:15 and asked if I could still get food. I was told they close at 9:00 and were only open till 10:30 on weekends. Either yelp has the hours wrong or they didn't want to serve a hungry customer. Won't be attempting to come back again.

Amazing little find in the middle of the neighborhood. I was having a rough day and was stranded with vehicle troubles. Decided to go eat while I wait and found Basil & Garlic Bistro. This is a truly authentic Italian restaurant with great food that was so fresh.  Must make a  trip back here.
