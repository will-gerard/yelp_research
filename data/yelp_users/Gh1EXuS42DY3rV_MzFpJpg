I have been riding by this place when visiting Safeway and finally decided to try it for breakfast after boycotting America's.  I was not disappointed.  The ham breakfast burrito I had was very filling.  My wife had the Chorizo breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint.  Most importantly we were greeted with a smile and warm welcome.  My second time here was the same.  I decided to try the Wednesday special, Arroz con Pollo and my wife had the chicken chimi.  We again were satisfied.  I hate to compare Chico's to a Filiberto's but it is similar in style but provides a better product and friendlier staff.  I am looking forward to spending happy hour here one day as it runs from 3 - 7pm and offers $2 imports and margarita specials.  If you have not checked Chico's out, just do it!  When there don't forget the salsa bar.  Thank you Chico's we will be back.

I liked it.  Aside from the loud business man behind us (keep your work at work or outside please).  The building is perfect for the Coronado hood and we were greeted with a smile and friendly hello.   I really enjoyed the Brie and Lavosh, very tasty.  My wife had the roasted chicken sandwich and Gorgonzola salad, I had a bite and it was delicious.  I enjoyed the Cafe burger and side salad, the burger was cooked to order and the balsamic vinaigrette was amazing.  Thank you Coronado Cafe, we will be back.  P.S.  Be prepared for a gravel drive, all you ladies in high heels.

Dive bar, most definitely.  This place rocks.  I was picturing something completely different, after driving by so many times, but found my self incredibly comfortable here.  Miss Lil was a great bartender and many would do good to see how she works behind the bar.   If you have an open mind and don't cause drama I would recommend giving the Royale a try.

Yes, glad I finally tried Mr. Bianco's famed sandwich spot.  Added bonus was that they now serve pizza next door, no more 2 hour wait.   The food is fresh and delicious.  Every dish is a culinary masterpiece and a palette pleas-er.  I would suggest the Mozzarella Sandwich (a Caprese on bread), but always check out the daily special.  Decent selection of craft beers and wine.  Just go and enjoy.

This place lived up to the hype.  I had the pleasure of eating their pizza at a friends house after a move, but have not actually gone in to view the menu.  My wife and I went during lunch and were impressed upon leaving.  The food was delicious and there was plenty of it on each dish we ordered.   We shared a pitcher and started with the artichoke dip, which was served with soft flat bread instead of mouth roof tearing crostinis, great dip.  I had the Italian sandwich, which I finished the following day for lunch at work, delicious again.  My wife had the lunch pizza slice, great quality and even greater price.  Nothing disappointed food wise.  The service was a little slow, but I believe they were astonished at the drop in business due to the end of spring training and did not know what to do with so many servers on.  This will not deter us from returning, see you soon Oregano's.

Another good dining experience.  Dianne was our server and did not disappoint.  We went in the middle of lunch (I don't know why) around 12:15, and despite 100 degree temp we sat on the patio at the bar.  It was warm, but the shade and misters helped.  We shared a "slice," which is 2 pieces, and some wings.  We usually prefer the wing of the wings over the drums, but did not have that option.  The wings were fantastic!  The medium sauce was the perfect heat.  We washed this down with a couple of cold beers and left again with a smile.  Thank you Oregano's.

This place was AWESOME!!!  My wife and I have been driving by this location for a couple years and finally decided to go in, I had a yearning for Ramen.  It did not disappoint.  We got there just before happy hour, which is always a bonus, but would still go outside of happy hour.  The menu is quite extensive, the bonus is they have Italian noodle dishes as well.  We have been told that this is authentic to Japan so I was impressed to see this in the valley, having been to many "Japanese" restaurants.  We decided to try many different dishes, and were equally impressed with all.  I had the TanTan-Men, a spicy Ramen with pork, delicious.  We shared some tuna sashimi, which was fresh and tasty (looked like real pink, no added color).  We also shared the Seafood Delight roll, which has tuna, 'krab' and is topped with a scallop, fantastic.  The last thing we ordered were the Spicy Korean Ribs, this was my least favorite, but still good.  Of course the Kirin (on draft) was flowing as well as the house Saki.  Overall the CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe impressed us to say the least.  We will be back to try more.  Thank you CherryBlossom, keep up the Great Work.

The "Dillo" is where it's at if you want a good meal and drink.  Plenty of TVs for sports and horse racing if that is your thing.  Excellent sports bar, friendly staff, good food, and did I mention the drinks?

Ono is Ono...I would have given 5 stars but "as good as it gets" is backyard/beach luau on the Islands.  For those of you that don't know Ono has many meanings, it can describe a delicious dish (that teriyaki plate was Ono) or your wanting of something (I am Ono for a beer right now).  My first experience of Ono was living on the west side driving back to CA and I saw it off of Dysart road next to my bank.  I went in and got just what I wanted for the trip to CA, a couple of spam musubi.  Now living in Phoenix I am glad to know that Ono is a hop and a skip away.  I have been there multiple times but am lazy on reviews.  If you are looking for a different lunch, or easy dinner, then you are in for a treat.  Plate lunch is what we call it, but plate dinner, or leftovers, works as well.  I would recommend to start off with the BBQ Plate Combo, it has a piece of teriyaki chicken, teriyaki beef, and a korean kalbi style short rib.  To top it off traditional plate lunch is also served with mac salad, a scoop of rice (sometimes two) and Ono likes to put some steamed cabbage on the bottom of the meat.  Get a side of Rooster Sauce (Sriracha) to dip your meat or rice in and you will look up with a smile.  My favorite is the Spam Musubi, a piece of spam, rice and sauce, wrapped in seaweed.  Different Ono's have different items, but plate lunch is a staple at all.  If you are a light eater you may want to split any plate lunch combo.  If you think you can do it and can't then score, you have dinner or a snack later.  Either way you will be happy.  I only wish they had brew to wash it down with, but good thing about plate lunch is it is just as good when you get it home as when it was put in the box.  Writing this made me Ono for Ono, mmmm.

What a great dining experience.  My wife and I celebrated our anniversary here recently and will return. We both enjoyed our meals, appetizers, beverages,  and dessert.  My wife enjoyed the scallops, delicious. I enjoyed the pork loin, fantastic.  The wine list was humongous,  and everything was reasonably priced.  Our server took good care of us which pushed this to a five star review. Remember that dining should be a great experience and in my "point of view" this' Point of View' checked all the boxes.

Woohoo is right!  This place is awesome.  If you are interested in great Vietnamese food try it out.  I will not lie, you will not be wowed by the level of service or the ambiance.  The food speaks for itself.  My wife and I have left each time with the cheapest lunch/dinner we have ever had and still were completely satisfied.  Everything on the menu is worth trying and comes to you fast and fresh.  The only draw back is no beer but hey plenty of that elsewhere.  To sum it up, no frills, great food, easy on the wallet.

Wings, Wings, Wings, and more Wings!  I have always been a fan of Native on Bell and am disappointed to see so many low star reviews.  The wings have never let me down and the beer is always cold.  Happy hour is the best time to enjoy discounted drinks and if you dine in on Tuesday enjoy discounted wings as well.  Sunday boasts the NFL ticket with many nice TVs to view your favorite team.   It would be nice to see it go back to the Bills bar that it used to be.  Keep staying strong Native on Bell!

Yay!  I'm a fan of the ballpark, not the D-Backs, Go Dodgers!  With that said, sorry everyone, I am a transplant and although AZ is now my home I can not stop cheering for my home teams.    Chase, Bank One, whatever you want to call it is a wonderful field.  The temperature is always right, the beer is always cold, and the concessions are pleasing.  I love this ballpark.  Even cheering for the visiting team I have always felt comfortable here.

I used to drive past this place daily and have always heard great things about their food.  I remember going there when it was Bobby McGee's.  They still have the club ambiance late night and it looks pretty popping if you are into that.  We just went for the food.  I was stoked after checking in to see that they offered a first Yelp check in for 10% off your check, score.  The food was great.  My wife had the rib platter, very tasty, juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious.  I had a Catfish Po'Boy along with a side of Mac n' Cheese, both were great.  They have plenty of drinks and a nice selection of beer on tap.  Thank you Bobby Q's, when I am in the need of BBQ I will be back.

North Valley Mexican excellence.  I have only been here one time that I was disappointed with the service, but one time compared to many other enjoyable times is forgivable.  Great food, excellent drinks and the bar is where it's at.  My favorite is the heart stopping Fundido.  Happy hour has 1/2 priced apps and BIG mugs to wash them down.  Chips and Salsa are in abundance and may fill you up before you enjoy your meal, so take it easy.  Great for a date night, family dinner/lunch, or a happy hour excursion.

Let me say this up front, my wife used to work @ St. Francis so we are fortunate to know the servers and staff, this always makes for a friendly environment.  I have never had any item that I did not enjoy, in fact I have a new appreciation for fresh ingredients after having the pleasure of dining here.  Chef Aaron can be compared to Picasso with a brush, or even Stephen King with a pen, except he perfects his ideas with kitchen utensils putting his work on plates.  Alex, Korbi and David serve great drinks.  Kayla and Dylan have both served us and are always attentive to their tables.  Brunch is excellent, I would recommend the Egg Sandwich or Eggs Benedict, and you can't go wrong with any of the baked goods.  Happy hour is fantastic, very good deals.  For lunch I would recommend the French Onion Burger, always cooked to what you order and one of the tastiest burgers I have had in the Valley.  The menu is seasonal so don't be afraid to try something new.  During your wait enjoy the building, the lines are amazing, and there is a mural from local artist Dose on the second floor.  Thank you St. Francis.

I'll be honest, at first try I thought "meh".  Second try "mmm".  Third try" YES"!  Every visit we have been greeted with a smile and asked how our day is going.  Top that off with speedy service and quality ingredients and you have a winner.   I recommend the milanesa de res and add an egg.  I have yet to try the tacos but Guero's is a tortas shop after all.

My wife suggested Switch for brunch on a Saturday morning.  We were quickly seated and beat the late rush, which always starts a meal right.  We were given good service, good drinks, and good food.  The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable inside, and has a nice outdoor area as well.  The ambiance is a little trendy, but it was not a deterrent.  Their brunch specials are exceptional and we left quite happy.  I had the chef special, a slow cooked pork sandwich, very tasty.  My wife enjoyed the crepes juevos rancheros, which were delicious.  We also shared a carafe of screwdriver, which tasted like it had fresh squeezed OJ, thumbs up.  I have been there once before and have never been disappointed in the food or service.    Thank you Switch, we will be back.

Pappadeaux has been my go to ever since I moved here.  I remember spending a night at their bar watching Kim blow the D-Back's lead in the World Series while eating some fried alligator.    Since then I have learned to appreciate food more and have become quite fond of Pappadeaux, especially during happy hour.  Pappadeaux's has never let me down in regards to food.  When you sit at the bar the service is sometimes, more often then not, lacking (hence the reason for only four stars).    You can't go wrong with the Oysters, and their Po' Boys are on point.  If you are there for dinner anything you order is sure to please, but maybe try the seafood platter.  Pretty sure we have sampled most of the menu, which does change.  If you have never had Alligator, try it!!  I can go on and on, but again I don't remember a menu item I did not like or would not recommend.  Me not being a dessert fan it is hard, but I would recommend the key lime pie.  Pappadeaux's you are a treat, thank you for the fresh product and refreshing drink.

If you are a smoker then this is the best bar in town.  I am a ex-smoker so the outdoor second hand did not bother me, but if you are picky then sit inside.  What did bother me was the service.  Our server seemed too cool and it took forever to get a drink order in let alone our tab when finished.  It is a shame that the service was lacking as this spot is super cool, and as my wife would say "cute."  The balcony and outdoor seating is perfect and I can see why there are people here consistently.  The food, and this is from a take out point of view, was blah.  We wanted the potato skins (which they were out of) so ended up taking home a Reuben.  The Reuben was put on 2 pieces of white bread, so weird.  The meat was OK but that bread just put me off.   Oh well, win some loose some.  Maybe I will give it another try when wanting a drink and some second hand smoke.  Either way, cool place for the college/hipster crowd, but just didn't work for me.

Please read Sarah W's Review.    If your in college or single and want a good place to hang out then San Felipe's is for you.  I bet the food would be much better when hanging out with friends after a few cold ones, but I thought the food was very blah.  Service was just as blah and mind you we went when there was no crowd.  Tacos, overpriced...shrimp cocktail, swimming in Clamato...nachos, OK, can't really mess up nachos.  Beer, good if the bartender would refill our glass.  That's that, all I have to say.

We used to live in the Melrose District off of 7th Ave and must be spoiled from 7th Ave's America's service.  7th St has only treated us right the first time we came in.  Since then there have been no greetings, just a long wait and "will this be for here or to go?"  This review has been a long time coming, with the hopes that service would improve, it has not.  One Sunday I waited 20 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos, mind you it was breakfast time and I was the second customer in line.  The only thing good about America's on 7th St is the food.  I would much rather ride my bike to 7th St, but will instead drive to 7th Ave for your food based on service alone.  I love the story behind America's and your product, but just because you have a strong following doesn't mean that service should not be present.

My wife and I moved to the neighborhood back in September but had visited the Tuck Shop before moving.  This is a true neighborhood restaurant.  You are always greeted with a friendly "Hello" when entering and "Have a good night" when leaving.  We try to visit at least once a week, and can honestly say that everyone we see receives the same treatment.  John and Laura are by far our favorites, but the entire staff is courteous and always willing to assist.  Oh yeah, the food...the food is fantastic!  We have tried almost every item on the menu, which is seasonal, and have not tried something we did not like.  The drinks, courtesy of Laura, are poured perfectly and always leave you with a smile.    My favorites would be the Shrimp Po' Boys, Flapjacks, and Brussel Sprouts.  My wife is a fan of the Dates.  Make sure to ask what the specials are, as they change nightly.  I don't have a favorite entree, except maybe the Ravioli (special entree), but you will not be disappointed with whatever you choose.  Enjoy!

Scramble is a refreshing change to counter service.  They offer a smile, good/fresh food, and they are all about supporting the local economy.  This does come with a price so don't expect a Denny's special.  I prefer the breakfast burrito, enough to keep me full until dinner, and my wife usually eats the Santa Fee Benedict.  Everything we have eaten here is delicious.  I would definitely recommend a side of bacon, thick and tasty.  Wash it all down with some OJ or a Iced Mocha and you should leave happy.  Perfect way to end a hike from North Mountain or start a long day after a late night.  Thank you Scramble.

Postino, you are a blessing to Central PHX.    I have always been impressed with the quality of food that is placed in front of me.  Of course the $5 drink specials are what brought me here, but it is not just the drink that keeps me coming back.  For any first timer you should try any of the Boards, but they are known for the Bruschetta board, you will not be disappointed (unless you don't like bruschetta).  Share a sandwich or salad, and make sure to ask what the soup of the day is, always worth a try.  Finish it off with the Salted Caramel Sundae, not a sweets fan but the saltiness is perfect.   Your building is beautiful and well thought out and I love the old school skate stickers that I spot randomly.  With so many reviews mine may be overlooked but for those of you reading that have been here you know that this is about as good as it gets.

My wife and I have been coming here for a while, this review is long over due.  If you are unfamiliar Gallo Blanco is located in the Clarendon, a nice stay-cation spot here in the Valley.   Our last visit was during Devour for Waste Not so we could enjoy some Pork Belly Tacos, they did not disappoint.  We started with the Chips and Guacamole, a must have whether it's your first time or not.  We also split many tacos, the Octopus, Ahi, and  Cochinita.  Our least favorite was the Ahi, which was weird because we are huge Ahi fans.   I would be safe to say that anything you order here should not disappoint.  Thank you Gallo Blanco for being a Gem in the heart of Phoenix.

The staff here wear shirts that say "Eat more Pho" and I agree.  This place has great food and has now become a weekend religion for my wife and I.  With so many options on the menu I can not pick a favorite, but the egg-rolls are a great starter, any Pho you pick is good, and the Banh Mi's have been great.  Fair warning, do not expect 5,4, or 3 star service, this place is about the food.  A tip for first timers, note your table number (located on the condiment tray) and pay at the counter.  If you don't finish your food there are self serve to go containers by cashier.  "Eat more Pho" Phoenix!

Hula's was my very first check in on Yelp, over a year ago.  It was not until recently that I even began writing reviews, now I'm addicted.  I used to live closer and we would go during Tiki Time.  I had a bad service experience and ceased coming until my wife talked me into going again.  It is what it is and I am happy to have gone back.  Hula's is one of the few places that offers "Poke" so this is one of the main reasons I am now a fan.  Their Poke is a different style then I am used to, but good none the less.  They also offer nice stiff drinks and have a nice selection.  I honestly have to say I have not been overly impressed with any entrees I have had, but definitely enjoy the appetizers.  This doesn't mean that I will not try more, I just have to find the right one.  I almost gave only 3 stars, but because of the Poke, drinks, and your outstanding building I upped it to 4.  I will be back and hungry for more Poke, thank you Hula's.

I will be honest, the first and second time I visited TMI I was extremely disappointed, mainly with the service.  My wife and I decided to give it another chance and we have since become fans.  They offer a good happy hour and the meals are enough to split between two people.   I would definitely recommend the "Artichoke Heaven" or "TMI Toast" as a starter.  Any sandwich you pick should not disappoint, my favorite's are "The Sheridan" and the "RB & C."  I would recommend the greens as your side, the dressing is delicious.    My favorite is that I can take it back to the old school and order a Mickey's wide mouth hand grenade as a beverage.  There beer list is quite extensive and they have many local brews on tap, along with other fine beverages.  Thank you TMI for turning my frown upside down.

Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose America's.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado America's rude service that I boycotted that particular location.    Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave.

Please take the advice of the other reviews for this company.    We are also renters and noticed a funny smell.  Long story short a water pipe broke under our house, a historical home mind you.  Parker and Sons came out first, my wife was amazed at their service, and they determined what was wrong.  Our property manager decided to get a second opinion and Faith entered the scene.    The first thing they did was tear up the kitchen tile, not covering any cabinets, so we are still cleaning dust.  The next thing they did was 2 months later, finally getting the "new" flooring back down.  The delay was blamed on back ordered flooring, which is understandable because our landlord picked vinyl flooring which probably isn't even made anymore because it belongs in a mobile home.  Then once the flooring was down they did not have replacing the base boards on "the paperwork."  We got to wait another week for this to be completed.  Delay after delay, excuse after excuse, not to mention a rude secretary/phone assistant, and we finally have a floor that looks like ____ (fill in the blank).  I can honestly say that every employee who came to the house were very nice, but that does not make up for all the wrong done by the company.  My review of the "management company" will soon be coming after our lease is up, in fear of our A/C breaking and not being fixed by the proper company until possibly October, or any other possible retaliation.  Do your homework Yelper's, it pains me to be a man of faith and see a company use the word Faith as smoke and mirrors for a rip off.

Really, $5 for a smashed burger and little flavor?  Can't say that I will be back, except for the fried pickles, maybe.    I guess there are certain burger joints that I don't understand, this is one of them.  I heard great things but was very disappointed.  The flavor of the burger just wasn't there.  I was not a fan of the fries, too much rosemary for me.  Again, the fried pickles were amazing and they serve beer, so that was a bonus.  Maybe it was just me, but still worth a try for those of you who have not ate here.

"Meh" is the perfect word for Stingray.    Always good quality sushi, but every time I go I can't help to think that I over payed.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and service is decent.  I guess I need to stick to only going during Happy Hour so that I can up my rating.

Wow, this place got bashed by others.  Everything that we experienced was great.  I had no appointment and stopped by on a Thursday morning.  Our Service Consultant, Derrick, explained that they were busy, but that he would help as best he could.  That he did.    We needed some warranty work done and Derrick wrote us up right away.  We were lucky enough to get a MINI loaner, without notice mind you.  When the work was finished, the following day, I received a courtesy call from Derrick.  Due to work I was unable to pick up my car until the next day, which was no issue at all.  Thank you Derrick, and thank you MINI of Tempe.  I hope our next visit is as accommodating.

Nobuo, WOW!  What a dining experience.  I have only had the opportunity to watch such fine sushi chefs on 'No Reservations' and the like, but I would imagine that Nobuo would compare in likes of a different sushi experience.  I was impressed with the food, presentation, taste, and the unique change from the common sashimi and other Japanese fare from other restaurants.  The fifth star is not present, unfortunately, due to service.  My wife and I went during restaurant week so the menu was limited, but very delicious to say the least.  I will have to go back to write a complete review on the food items.   To start the meal we were given a plate with four items, what I really enjoyed was the Kim Chi from that plate.  Our starters were yellow tail shooters and a plate of white fish (sorry I don't remember the name) topped with a hot oil, WOW to both starters.  For our entree my wife had the pork belly, tasty, but what blew us away was my entree of bass steamed in parchment paper.  These were all accompanied with draft Sapporo and refreshing Sake.  I am not the biggest dessert fan, but my wife did enjoy.  Thank you Nobuo we will be back, worth every penny!

My wife and I have been waiting to try out Fuego Tacos.  We finally did on a Wednesday afternoon, and bonus - Happy Hour was going on when we arrived (starts at 2pm).  We were not disappointed and Matt, our bartender, gave excellent service as well as taco recommendations.  We had the Pernil, Carne, Chicken Street, Fish, and Barbacoa (don't judge us, it boasts tacos and we wanted to sample them).  My favorite was the Carne Asada.  If your a fan of America's Carne, Fuego is giving them a run for the money.  The chips and salsa were great, home made chips mind you.  The runner up for our favorite taco was the Pernil.  Needless to say, we'll be back.  Thank you Matt and thank you Fuego, a gem in the now dismal Esplanade.    P.S.  Make sure to validate your parking before leaving Fuego.

This place is legit.  Fresh food, smiling faces, we left happy.  The stuffed Poblano was delicious.  I enjoyed the Torta as well, if you are looking for a good Torta come here.  You choose your meat on most of the dishes and again the ingredients were fresh, not common in a lot of Mexican Restaurants that we go to.    Give Pablano a try, I hope you enjoy.

My wife and I have been coming to Rice Paper since they opened.  We have never been disappointed with the food, sometimes the service, but that seems to have been handled as of lately.  Vietnamese restaurants get a bad wrap for being dirty or unkempt, Rice Paper breaks that mold and provides a clean, sleek and modern feel.  I would definitely recommend the wings with the fish sauce reduction, a different taste and probably some of the most flavorful nontraditional wings I've tasted.  You will not be disappointed with any of the Banh Mi's, and the Pho's are very tasty as well.  What they are famous for is in their name, spring rolls rolled in rice paper.  I enjoy the Spicy Asian and the Spider, but try them all, or a couple at a time.  The fried pork spring rolls are our favorite as well as the fire cracker shrimp.    Parking can be limited so if your going with a big party maybe think about carpooling.  Happy hour is seven days a week and ends at 6:30.  Give it a try and enjoy.

I have been going to Windsor since they opened.  I don't know why it is just now that I am writing this review.  This place does not, and never has, disappoint.  Just like Postinos they have the same drink special, $5 pitchers, special cocktails, and glass of wine before 5pm, but their menu is more extensive.  The menu is always changing, but some staples you will want to try are - Kale Salad (chopped or Caesar), Windsor Burger (if you get fries ask for the Gold Sauce for dipping), Ceviche, whichever platter they have in the starters, and the Pastrami Reuben.  When you are adding sides I would suggest the Jo's Church Potatoes (it is like hash browns mixed with mac and cheese), the Mac N' Cheese is great, and I am a fan of the Fried Okra.  Finish or start any of these with a pitcher, cocktail, or glass of wine and you will leave with a smile.  The Tape Wall is definitely worth checking out if you have never been here, it will bring back memories if you remember what tapes are.  Thank you Windsor.

Jamaican food is not my favorite, but after reading reviews and driving by many times my wife and I made it a point to try the Jerk Hut out.  I am glad we did.  The food reminded me of our recent trip to Jamaica, as did the building, parking lot and staff, complete "ya man no problem" vibe.  I enjoyed the oxtail with plantains on the side (not a huge fan of plantains either, but enjoyed and will order again).  My wife had the Jerk Chicken and after tasting it we were both in agreement that we would order it again.    The Jerk Hut is a nice change from the norm and should not be overlooked.

I am a fan of primarily sashimi, not rolls, but have heard good things about this place.  To quote a friend, "it is Chipotle style, but sushi rolls."  They were correct, except I have never been greeted by a friendly staff at Chipotle.  The opposite was true at How Do You Roll, we were greeted with a "Hello how are you today, is this your first time in?"  They walked us through all of our options and explained every combo we could make.  They have 6 standard rolls and an option to build your own.  They also have a small selection of alcohol to accompany your decision.  My wife and I had the "Slammin' Salmon" and "3 Alarm Roll" and were not disappointed.  We also had the calamari salad, which is the same as any other sushi joint in the valley.  I was surprised how impressed I was by the food and counter service.  I will definitely be back.    If you build your own roll on your first visit be prepared for them banging the gong.

I have been searching for a good Cheesesteak, and I have found it.  These guys are living my dream.  The owner and his wife started with a food truck and are now running a nice little spot.  They do so with a smile and friendly Hello when you come through the door.  Really glad they are close to the house and work.    P.S.  Park in back

This place was Whack!  I would rather go to Subway, it would actually be an improvement on service and flavor.    My wife and I went in and apparently they were doing a to go order so we waited about 3 minutes before even being acknowledged, by the way we were the only people in line.  After the 3 minutes we were finally asked what we wanted.  After ordering we noticed a very uncommunicative Manager trying to direct an employee, just a tip, if you want someone to do something you actually have to say it.   Upon check out the same Manager helped us and was still uncommunicative.  Very disappointing that the representative of the establishment doesn't say "thank you, sorry for the wait," or even "I hope you enjoy your meal."  Well if we had enjoyed the meal I may be giving another star, but we didn't.  Maybe it was an off day but we will not be back to test our luck.

Already a fan.  Astor House is the neighbor to Tuck Shop, but is open for breakfast, lunch and late night snacks.  They have three different menus for each time of the day and cocktails to accompany the menus.  It is great to be able to go to the friendly and welcoming environment, that Tuck always offers, during the day time.    For breakfast, I would recommend the Biscuits and Grillades, which is a slow cooked beef and gravy on top of a biscuit, DELICIOUS!  We also had the Pastelito, which is a pastry stuffed with meat, very tasty.  We shared the Apple Boxty, which was topped with Marscapone and did not disappoint.  If you need to wake up, try a glass of the Japanese Cold Brew.  Lunch and late night nibbles to be reviewed later.  P.S. They have a progressive Happy Hour starting at 3pm.  Parking is North of the restaurant across the street by the Musicians Union.

Food - Delicious.  Interior - Beautiful.  Everything else - Horrible.  I had high hopes for Sochu House and was prepared for some kinks based on the reviews.  After having my In-Laws come down for lunch on a Wednesday, kinks are definitely what we experienced .  We were sat at a wet table, thank you for wiping it clean but maybe have a dry cloth as well.  We ordered drinks, after waiting about 10 minutes, and waited another 15 minutes before another server checked on us to which we had to ask about our drinks.  We were then informed that 2 of the drinks ordered, Sapporo Draft, were unavailable.  I canceled the beer order.  Luckily we ordered our food at the same time we ordered our drinks.  Having Tapas on your menu is great, and when we order food and specifically ask to "start with..." I would expect that to be noted.  Instead our food was brought out at random.  We enjoyed the White Truffle Edamame, super tasty.  We also had the wings, spicy and tasty, along with the crispy wanton, very tasty and the sauces that accompanied them were great.  My Wife and her Father had the Pad Thai, I thought it was good, but they said it was spicy.  I enjoyed the lunch special but have since forgotten the name.  We also had the crispy fish salad.  All of the food was delicious and well worth every penny.  What put the cherry on top of a "bad service sundae" was when a glass of water was spilled in the lap of my Mother In-Law during clearing the table.  When something like this happens it is an accident and easily understood if a simple, sincere apology is given, and maybe even a Manager told about what happened, neither of these were done.  After this we receive our check with our canceled drinks still on the tab, this too had to be brought to our server's attention to be removed.  What kept this from being a total rant on bad service is because the Manager stopped us on our way out and asked why one of us had wet pants and whose fault it was.  Had this gone unnoticed I don't think that even the wonderful food could justify a one star rating.   She in turn refunded our bill, thank you.   I do hope that this is one of the last low star ratings Sochu receives.  The restaurant has great potential and a tasty menu to back it up.  Maybe this was a learning experience for us all.

They have done it again.  Great concept, great food, great building, great staff, and pricing is just right.    If you are looking to break the Corporate Food Chain monotony of 7th Ave and McDowell then Vovomeena is where to go.  Delicious local food and excellent coffee selections.  I can not pick a favorite on the menu, but can say that everything will be sure to not disappoint, so you are safe to close your eyes, point, and try it.

Wow Upward Projects, what can't you do?  Congratulations on your take over of Central Ave.  With Federal, Windsor, and Postino there are choices for all.  Federal's pizza is baked deliciousness.  Unique combinations on each pizza and excellent starters to choose from compliment the menu and my stomach.  Sandwiches are great and all can be washed down with a great selection of draft beer.  My wife prefers the wine coolers which are very tasty I must admit.    Take home a Chub and anything from the menu.  Enjoy discounted drinks before 5pm.  Take your date here for a nice dinner.  Enjoy the outdoor seating and people, car watch with good food and drink.  Any way you choose to do it you should not be disappointed.   Thank you Upward, and my apologies to Windsor and Postino for the transfer of my business for the time present, but we will be back.

A bright bloom in a beautiful garden.  Gertrude's was amazing.  My wife and I went for lunch and were pleasantly satisfied with the service, food, and the beautiful surroundings.  A tip for those who go, Gertrude's is conveniently located at the Garden Entrance.  Gertrude's offered a unique menu with many items to choose from.  We shared the pablano hummus plate that offered delicious pickled veggies to compliment the tasty hummus.  My wife enjoyed the pasta dish and I devoured half of the swine sandwich (the other half was enjoyed the following day at work).  I noticed a pork belly taco, which will be my next choice as there is no doubt we will be returning.   I almost forgot to mention the great beer selection, tap and bottle, as well as mixed drinks or whatever you choose from a full bar.  Whether you go for a dinner date, or an afternoon lunch I am sure you will enjoy.  Thank you Gertrude's.

Great local spot!  From a wonderful food truck comes a wonderful sit down.  I loved the beer selection and the food is excellent.  I suggest the fried pickles or corn dog to start off with, after that it's up to you.    Thank you Short Leash for being an example of the Phoenix pride, you are models of a great business plan and community leaders.

My wife and I waited to come in until the opening kinks were worked out, well worth the wait.  This place is beautiful, has great food, friendly service, and was an overall great dining experience.  It looks like they have a pretty good happy hour, we went for lunch.  I enjoyed the pig face dumplings, octopus and duck buns (don't worry they were individual).   The kim chi and homemade sriracha on the dumplings were delicious.  If you get the ramen make sure to ask your server about the broth, be prepared as it is a "clever" take on ramen and one you may not be used to, but still very tasty.  Last but not least don't park in G&D's parking lot, they will tow and that could ruin a good dining experience.  Thank you Clever Koi, we will be back (and probably often).

I have been hesitating on reviewing what I feel to be the best tacos in Phoenix.  The hesitation is in part that I want primos/huichos to be kept secret.  Enough of me being selfish, this spot is Lo Mejor! You can't go wrong with the carne or pastor but for a real tastebuds treat, treat yourself to the cecina.  Whoever dissed the tripas was wrong, not sure how they can be soft when they throw them on the grill right before your eyes.  Lengua is on point and so is the pollo.   I have been visiting this shop for well over a year and have never had anything I did not like.  My new go to is their burritos, so good.  So for some legit tacos, burritos, even some take home meat Primos is the place!
