Heinz products are a staple of the US pantry - even though the famous tomato ketchup is loaded with corn syrup - kids love it all the same.  Heinz "57" sauce, Salad cream (UK), Mayo and beans are all good too.

Ook.  Needs a remodel in a BAD way. Felt childish compared to Mandalay Bay and Luxor (on either side).  I bet kids would like the theme here.  Pro - less expensive than other strip hotels.

I just wanted to yelp that a few years back I ate at the Hamada in the Luxor and enjoyed it very much, but I hear they are now gone from there. Fresh fish, tasty maki and cutesy service (in kimono).  However, the next time I am in Vegas, I plan to try this branch of Hamada.

I love the Bellagio (I love Venetian, as well, but Bellagio to me is just terrific).  Classic design, top-notch restaurants (like Le Cirque), Great gaming areas, White-glove service. A great spa.  Yes, it costs a fortune - but to me - its worth it.  And those fountains - what fun!  I love it here!  Touristy bliss.

The venetian has (to me) the BEST pool on the strip. What a blast.  Please note that I never got to actually stay here - but I was at the ppol for a blessed and frying hot afternoon a few years back, and spent the rest of the evening in the cool-a/c-chilled casio at Venetian.  (I actually stayed at the Luxor that trip - see separate reviews)  Spring for a cabana - and you'll get great beverage service.  LOVE the Venetian's POOL!

I have stayed here twice - once in the Main pyramid - in a gorgeous suite with a hot tub, and another time in the Tower in a regular room.  needless to say - the suite was far nicer (and way more expensive).  I also attended a conference held in the meeting facilities and everything was well managed and well run.  We had plenty of food and cold drinks at break times.  I also ater in the sushi bar at the Luxor for one of my meals.  It was very good.  Oh - and I went to the spa which was just OK - will review separately.

Wow!  The decor alone is 5 star - and I was full after the bread selection.  (All homemade breads.)  Very, very RICH meal - and had I not gotten SICK as a dog afterward, I woulda given this place 5 stars.  Classic French Desserts were the best part.  Yes, it's expensive.  Yes, you're in Vegas.  Yes, it's over the top. We were treated like royalty and had a grand time.  My poor system just can't handle all that butter and cream.  Even the haricot verts salad was covered in a rich creamy dressing.  Lamb chops were EXPERTLY prepared and not over-salted.  Ah well, you only live once. - and you gotta come here at least once in your life.

I do not see the allure.  We got a big box of the mini sized brownies in a variety of flavors (100 - 120 a pop) and I tried the walnut.  Not great.  Kinda dry.  So I waited a bit and tried the original.  Just as dry and no walnuts.  Skip it.

So much fun to look around - so beautiful. I want to go at Christmas one year - so far I have been in the spring and summer.  Great for wedding photos - for the complete Vegas wedding experience. And it's all FREE!

What an impressive Castle.  I visited in 1988 and will never forget it.  We enjoyed our visit to Edinburgh and had some terrific Chinese and Italian Cuisine whilst there.

It never gets old - and it's FREE.  What can I possibly say that 111 others haven't?  My kid would love to watch these fountains and I feel blessed and lucky to have seen them 3 times in my life.  I love the Bellagio and these fountains (and mmusic) are great fun.

Viva Las Vegas - and all the old cliches apply. I love it here for 3-4 day stints about every 2-3 years.  I will never be a hard-core Vegas tourist, and I doubt if I will move here - but I enjoy visiting every few years and eating, drinking and indulging.  It's surprisingly good for families with kids - lots to do (think wave pools at the Venetian.)

Even though few people have ever heard of Astara (Biogenic Skincare) - this natural/holistic line - used in spas - is terrific.  Expensive but not crazy, and terrific products that really works.  It truly is like food for the skin.  Awesome!  Try the Golden Flame, Green Papaya and Blue Flam masques. I also swear by the antioxidant emulsion.  The products also happen to smell divine.  (All those essential oils and plant-derived ingredients make them smell so good.)
