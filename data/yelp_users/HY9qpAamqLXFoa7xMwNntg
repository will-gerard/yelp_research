i picked up a baja fish burrito from here the other day during the lunch rush and the line moved quickly as did my order through the line. while i was waiting i managed to snatch up a dq free blizzard coupon from their coupon wall which i have added to my jewish food stamp book.  i took my burrito to go as well as a couple of salsas and a to-go bag of chips (complimentary). got home and wolfed that bad boy down. short and fat little thing, but totally filling. the fish was good and they use cabage in their burritos which i love.   fresh, tasty, and filling. i'll be back. especially cuz they dropped a couple of coupons in my bag. incentives like that to come back are always good. and they have 1.99 margaritas. yum.

now that i live within walking distance of the paisley, it's become an addiction.  i would describe them as a catch all place for beer, wine, coffee, and food.  quite random inside actually, with all of the bikes and flags and the muddy fish tank (bleh, really guys?)...  lots of good wines and the beer selection is random and changes often...what i really come here for though is the food..lots of vegetarian options..my favorite would have to be the veggie burger...served panini style and made of brown rice and delicious veggies you seriously can't go wrong...their el greco sandwich is killer as well, if you're a meat eater, and it's served on this delicious toasted sourdough bagette.  their pasta salad is spot on too, i always get that as my side.  staff is friendly, your typical grand ave crowd can be seen here..randomness at it's finest...nice outdoor patio area, can't wait for the weather to cool down and enjoy some delicious brew and a tasty sandwich.

my car was a filthy mess and there was no way a clean freak 4.99 drive through wash would do the trick. i needed the works. melted sticky horchata running down my window and side of my car is no fun task to remove. nor is vacuuming up the mess of my backseat.  but for $25, los olivos had my car shining like new and smelling like potpurri.  my windows were sparkling clean, my carpets/floors were spotless, and my dash was so shiny i could barely see driving home. it took about 25 minutes for all of this.  i guess i could have done it myself and saved the 25 dollars but i didn't mind dropping the extra cash to pamper my lady.

i went here for the first time last night and had a blast...it was karaoke night and of course my drunk ass had to perform (we are the champions, by queen, in honor of the cardinals)...the crowd was smaller but decent, many new faces to me (really i don't go out to many lesbian bars)...  the drinks were decently priced (i've def had cheaper) and there are probably some nights where they have specials like $2 coronas which is easy on the wallet.  the bar is HUGE, with a big dance floor/stage area surronded by tables..the patio is big as well, with lots of tables and chairs, and the best part...a POOL TABLE!! so you can feel the burn of the smoke in your eye while shooting...i love it...

tried this place for the first time today, and i was impressed...  the place is a little hard to get into though, and i'm sure during a lunch rush it's crazy..  their pasta salad is one of the best i've ever had...bowtie noodles, my fav...loaded with green onions so be careful!  i got the bird is the word, which was delicious but lacking a good sauce inside...the pico de gallo was fresh and juicy as was the lettuce..and the wrap was so soft i could sleep on a bed of them...  super cute inside.

after my delicious first wrap, i went in here again and got the alota fajita with beef.  it was disgusting. i had two bites and spit the second one out. the beef was gritty and seasoned weird. the green peppers and onions were stringy and not nicely textured.  my salsa was watery and it had one huge tomato chunk it. the chips were STALE.  wtf, mate?

as a pet owner and dog groomer i come to ryans for nearly all of my pet and professional needs. cheap, wholesale prices, large selection, and friendly and helpful staff keep me coming back.  the warehouse is open from 8-4:30 m-f which is kind of a bummer because that is the average joe's work schedule and it might be hard for many people to get here during that time. luckily, i have days off during the week so visiting ryans is usually convenient for me. it's huge inside and you might get lost, but have a catalog handy and there are plenty of people walking around to help you find what you're looking for. you must purchase at least $25 worth of items from them each time you shop to keep the "cost low" for them. it's not very hard to do so it doesn't bother me much. they have everything for your pet you can imagine and all at reasonable prices. toys, clothes, leashes, brushes, shampoo, cologne, treats, all about 20% cheaper than your retail pet stores. you bring all your stuff to the front counter and the lady with foot long nails assists in checking you out. wam bam thank you ma'am.  ryans also has a blade/shear sharpening and grooming equipment repair part to it (the side on the right). i always bring all of my grooming stuff here for them to fix/sharpen and usually they can have it back to me in a day or two. they do a good job too. they also have lots of "left over" blades and shears that people left there that you can get at half the price of a new one. i got a pair of $70 shears for $30, and a $30 blade for $12. freaking sweet!  i love ryans pet supply and will continue to give them my business over any other chain pet supply store.

everyone has a comfort food so naughty santa wouldn't visit you for 5 years knowing you indulged...looks like i'll never be getting another christmas gift for as long as i live because i've tried nearly every one of rainbow donuts' tasty little morsels.  even if  i saw cockroaches crawling on the floor (which i didn't), i'd still eat their donuts. my favorite, by far, is the whipped cream glazed donut. i could eat 5 of them and not feel bad. their coffee is great too, and you could walk out of there with a couple donuts and a cup o joe for around 4 bucks. these are the best donuts you can get in town. so soft and chewy you wouldn't even know you ate 5 of them until you're keeled over with the sweetness stomach cramps.customer service was great, it's a family owned local joint, so it's def a place to respectably spend your moolah.  totally. worth it.

chihuly chihuly chihuly.   visited dbg for the first time for the chihuly event "agave on the rocks" and for 75 a person the event was done beautifully. well worth it. drinks were good, food was mediocre, but the atmosphere is what made the event. not too yuppy but still with plenty of trendy. the art is spectacular and it looks like the desert took acid and smoked a couple of joints. the area is large with lots to explore.  def a must-see.

Finally got around to checking out this place for lunch time on my day off - they close early so I rarely get to make it to these hip sandwich spots..  Despite the tiny menu of items, my friend and I managed to find two sandwhiches that sounded delicious.  Not sure what to expect for $8, I ordered the tuna and she got the tomato and mozzarella. we also picked up the tea/lemonade which brought us up to a little over $11 each. normally my cheap ass does not spend more than $5 for lunch (subway, anyone?) so my expectations were high from the second my card was swiped.  the sandwiches were made quickly and came packed up to go in a very cute bag. we grabbed a table outside and dug in. the bread that they oven bake is delicious and the sandwich was surprisingly big and filling. the tuna was made without mayo (which i prefer) and the tomato/mozzarella was fresh, juicy, and delicious.  the tea was refreshing and tart, just how i like it.  for $8, I'd expect at least a bag of kettle chips to go on the side, or something. i find it weird to eat a sandwich without a side, especially without some salt and vinegar chips. this place probably gets quite crowded during the break of lunch, but we went it wasn't too bad at 1:30pm. more seating would be nice, and hopefully they get some misters going for summer lunch patrons cuz you're right in the sun.

i love this place so much for the down home new york city corner look of it. it seriously looks like they picked this place up from manhattan and delivered it to phoenix.  yes, it's small and a little cramped inside. get it to go and let me gawk at all the amazing products lined up across their shelves. so many rare types of strange delicacies i can't believe it. lutefisk! i haven't tried it but i'm going to give it a go next time i'm in there.  although the place may look like a total bummer inside with it's computer-paper-print outs hanging all over the wall listing their food, you can't really deny the cheesiness (oh puns) of this place. they're very friendly inside and recommended i try the corned beef sandwich with melted swiss and mustard. the bread was so soft it nearly melted in my mouth and the corned beef was top notch and not extremely fatty. it was a perfect size as well, not too big and meaty but not too scrawny. packed a lotta punch. they use boars head meats, and you can't really go wrong there.  prices are very reasonable too, you can get out of their unscathed for a mere ten bucks. it's community seating inside so be prepared to go cozy.

One word - calpico.  i tend to judge restaurants based on their drinks, and this one totally won me over. at first, i was a little hesitant to try a beer mixed with yogurt, but my waiter assured me that it was all the rage in japan, and being the trend and culture whore that i am, i decided to give it a shot. very sweet, with a slight beer aftertaste and tang. definitely worth getting if you like beer, or even if you don't it's delicious.  as for the food, it was pretty good. i got the nagasaki sara udon special with seafood..my friends decided to devour all of the little creepy looking octopuses on my plate before i could even try one, which was ok with me, because honestly, they were scary looking.  a duck salad started us off with tender duck and a sweet honey-mustard like sauce. we also got 2 plates of sushi (caterpillar and spicy tuna) and both were delicious and well priced. miso soup was a little on the onion-y side.   the bread basket was delicious and a good start to our meal. our service was good, i had no qualms. def would go back, if anything for the calpico.

dear rhythm room,  i am so sorry that many great artists will be skipped over from playing in your gem of a venue due to the hipster ballroom that opened up and stole your indie spotlight. i will unfortunately have to patronize them due to my love for these buzzbands, but you  and your sweet, cheap draft beers, scuzzy bathrooms, random table & chair sets, awesome bartenders, dingy dark atmosphere, incredible sound and intimate stage presentation will forever hold a special place within me.  the best shows i've seen in phoenix have always been in your belly.  thank you, from the bottom of my burning indie heart.

starve yourself all day, get really baked, and then go to scotts and order one of their giant, mouth watering, tender sandwhiches.  the sandwhiches are generously loaded with so many different kinds of meat choices you're bound to find something that meets your needs. i'm a big corned beef eater, so i choose the pastrami, corned beef, and turkey sandwhich. my friend ordered the philly cheese.  both were terrific. the fries were crisp and delicious. the coleslaw was some of the best i've had. i also picked up some rugelach in every flavor- so sweet, soft, and delicious - try the chocolate raspberry, you can't go wrong.  we were the only ones in there on a saturday afternoon which was a little weird but made for an easy going dining experience. the interior is reminiscent of many jewish delis back east, with seinfeld playing on the tv and pictures of the owner's family filling the walls.  i'm a sandwhich whore and will definately be coming back for more.

ok, first of all, buffalo takes things based on current style/trends,so if you're turning in diesel jeans from 2 years ago, chances are you're not going to get anything for them, pal.  the best part about this store - and thrift stores in general - is scoring awesome items. i love that it has such a diverse selection of clothing with brands from everywhere..i have found so many awesome hoodies my closet is overstuffed! usually i'll bring in old clothes and swap for new ones to keep my style and look fresh - i love it, and i usually walk out of there paying no more than $20.   this store is a lot smaller than the tempe one, but still carries a pretty good selection due to its location in the hip/trendy part of phoenix..  went in there today, and got a brand new (still tagged) red DC reversable thermal hoodie for $20...which i saw at macys a month ago for $60. score!  thumbs up buffalo, your staff is cool and friendly and your clothes are hip.

really, I can't believe this place has received such high reviews from people.  my lady and i walked in, and were greeted rather rudely by a pretentious bitch at the front with a monotone "name please?", instead of a warm, friendly, french welcome to this rather charming looking place. we didn't have a reservation, which from the looks of how dead empty the place was, didn't seem like a problem. until the hostess whisked through her reservation list and explained she'd try to "fit us in". it was 6pm, the place had one other couple dining, and we were informed that the next party was arriving at 7:30. we weren't really looking to hang out. it would have be awfully lovely if yelpers would have informed of the need to MAKE RESERVATIONS before going in here, because if you don't, you're automatically a piece of shit according to the staff. sorry, i don't plan very much ahead. next time i will, and it won't be here.  anyways, after debating for a minute or two with herself, the hostess decided we could "squeeze in" and sat us right on top of the other couple inside the restaurant. she informed us that we could cork our own wine, for their low low price of 9 fucking dollars. in words only office space could adequately describe,"coup des tartes, what is it exactly that you do?".   the food was good, nothing spectacular for $25+ a plate. we got a salad with apples and nuts and bleu cheese, which was served warm. now this is the first warm salad i've had all of my life, and by no means am i some sort of wordly food expert, but i believe salad should be cold and crisp. not soggy and warm. yuck. the cordon bleu was tasty and filling, however, the wobbly table was an extreme annoyance when cutting through the chicken, but it was solved (with no thanks to the staff) by placing a jack-in-the-box gift card under the leg. i will admit, the mashed potatoes are some of the creamiest and best i've ever had. my lady got the pork tenderloin, which had a strange peppery-sweet pairing which i didn't particularly care for. we were broke for desert, so unfortunately we didn't get to try any tarts. you would think for a place that promotes itself as being so poise would get some fancier menus, other than a $.15 piece of cardstock copied in bulk at kinkos.  this place was rather disappointing. i honestly thought it would be way more comfy and welcoming inside but it really wasn't. it presents itself as being so high class and french and oh-la-la wee wee, but when it comes down to it, it's still located in a tiny shack of a house at 16th street and highland. maybe if it were located in the biltmore i'd give it a bit more cred.

i went in to exchange my BRAND NEW, STILL IN PACKAGE aquarium filter, and was told that without a receipt, I would not be able to exchange it.  this goes for all aquarium products over $10.  the manager was surprisingly rude, and didn't even attempt to save my business as i walked out of the door with my money that i will never spend at this pitiful excuse for a pet store.  CRAPPY!!!!!!!!

there are so many places around the valley that try to cater to the large chicago native population...but no other place brings me back to the good ol days of portillos greasy, juicy beef sandwhiches..and cheesey cheesey fries...and of course...the tamales! just how i remember them...  there is one person that complained how greasy the sandwhiches are -that's how theyre supposed to be! that's what makes tthem oh-so-delicious...  i live right down the street from this place and always like to splurge when i'm feeling in the mood for some good greasy grubby food. the guy that runs the place is always extremely friendly and i have never had a bad sandwhich here...

this place is lots of hype with no actual show.  i'm a big fan of the sushi happy hour, and if you are too, don't go here. their happy hour menu consists of like 5 rolls. which are you average run-of-the-mill sushi rolls, nothing special (spicy tuna, caterpillar, blah poo roll). they were extremely cheap though, something like 3 dollars for 8 pieces. and when they arrived at the table, i could see why. they're seriously no bigger than quarters. pathetic sushi, really. the drink specials were nothing to gawk about either, $1 off certain drinks. they have a very limited beer selection as well. i'd rather have walked next door to delux and gotten some good draft hefe, but i craved sushi.  zen32 disappoints.

this was hands down the best birthday cake i've ever had.  my girlfriend surprised me with it and was impressed with the crazy cake master skills tammie coe displayed while making it. she said she looked like a crazed scientist concocting a new potion, but kudos to tammie coe and her wild cake making skills. my gf went in there the day of my birthday, claimed she dropped my previous cake, and tammie whipped up a new one right away.  i loved the colors, not too feminine and not too masculine, somewhere right in the middle (like myself). the fondant was gorgeous, i loved the stripes and it tasted delicious (i had never had it before). the inside was filled with chocolate cake, white chocolate mousse, and raspberry - there couldn't have been a more delicious combination!  if you really want to impress someone special with a cake, tammie coe is surely the one to provide you with it.

PetSmart is the worst place to take your dog.  Their petshotel is disgusting..they leave your do in a steel kennel all by themselves and don't care to pay attention to your pup. One time they gave a dog the wrong medicine and had to pay thousands at the vet to get its stomach pumped. Do you really trust your dogs with these employees? They pay them crap wages and it shows in their service. They overcharge for your stay as most other private places will take better care of your dog for much cheaper - really all youre paying for is the name, and having a corporation behind it. Doggie day care is horrible too, dogs have been in there with fleas and they don't care to check them before they toss your dog in their with some random stranger's mangly mutt.  The dog grooming is even worse. I have heard many screams from upset pooches coming from the salon. Most of the groomers don't care about taking good care of your dog either, they just want to make money. And they will make money off your stupidity with their "Top Dog Care Package" which is $16 for a "oatmeal/hypoallergenic (*cough* bullshit)" shampoo and coniditioner, and a lame attempt at brushing your dogs teeth (do it yourself it's waste of money to get it done here).  Private salons and even vets offer their services at much cheaper prices and we all know that in this tough economy it's very important to save bucks wherever and whenever you can. Even worse than their overpriced grooms, they will call you every 8 WEEKS TO BOTHER YOU to bring your dog in. How annoying! I'll bring my dog in when I want to - harassing me over the phone will not get me to come in.    Their products are way overpriced - you can get many similar items at Ryans Pet Supply (14th and McDowell) for much cheaper.  Half the time they're out of something and can't even offer to tell you when they will be getting it, or direct you to something similar. I have seen dogs pee on the endcaps of shelves and employeees just stand around ignoring it.  Their Banfield vet is a joke. They wanted to charge me $180 to treat my cats ear infection. They are extremely overpriced and it's not personal whatsoever. They don't give a shit about your dog either.  Bottom line - go somewhere private. They will treat your dog a hundred times better and with more professional care.

whoever said it was the best damn chorizo is right. so good its only right that carolinas is located in so phx.   my friends and i went probably during the worst possible time for our first taste, during lunch hours (noon) and the place was PACKED. standing room only. we hoovered around people for a bit and managed to grab a table right when our food was up (which took about 15 minutes). the line to order was pretty quick though.  i got a deep fried red chile burrito and my friends got tacos, a tamale, and an oaxaca burrito (chorizo with beans, potatoes, and cheese). that oaxaca was the best damn burrito i've ever had and am sad i didn't order it myself. my deep fried burrito was steaming hot and hard to eat so a quarter of the way through i gave up and just used a fork. i like my meat shredded, not chunky, but these chunks were tender and NON-FATTY. yes, that's right, not a single piece of fat in mine. amazing. the tacos were a little soggy but delicious none-the-less, their tortillas are amazing. i didn't get to try the tamale but my friend said it was definitely a winner.   their fountain machine rocks. they have your usual mexican drinks on one side and pepsi products on the other. i got to mix in a little pepsi with my horchata and it is my new drink of choice.  carolinas is a must-eat for any mexican foodie.

carolinas, your enchiladas ruined it for me.  i can't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met. mole overload and non-existent chile. lacking any real taste to it whatsoever.  disappointed.

Go during the day...the dirty girls come out at night..unless of course, you're looking for that...  hands down the most classy club in phoenix. it's large and has just the right dimness to it..drink specials are good when you can come by them, and i've heard the food is decent..  as for the girls, it's a mix...you'd expect christie's to have the best of the best, but I saw a couple that looked extremely disinterested and unattractive...they have someone for your every type, as i saw a vast variety of girls (ethnicity, body, face, etc)...my main concern with the girls being that there are really no "edgy" girls there, as if they are not allowed...guess you have to keep that classy kind of look here, which is fine, but i can only handle so many blondes...  overall, i'd recommend this place if you're going to go to a strip club in the phoenix area...and if you hate it, bandaids is right down the street...

south mountain is THE place to go for great views and gorgeous trails.   ive never actually hiked the mountain, just driven up it. my friend and i have found a sick smoke spot, so listen up all you tokers to share in the most wonderful secret the mountain has to offer for the best sunset views- take central up the mountain and into the park and follow the signs towards the summit. when you get close to the top (its a long way up and a nifty drive) follow the signs to dobbins lookout. as soon as you get to dobbins lookout, park your car, and walk back down the road from which you came. walk down on the other side of the guard rail and it will take you to a secluded mountain drop off point where youre free to enjoy the most amazing view of phoenix you'll ever get. and a perfect place to smoke a beezy and take it all in.   south mountain makes living in AZ cool.

yeah, it might be a little eerie and kill bill-ish in there, but the food is fantastic. we were the only ones in there for a while so it was extra eerie..the service was alright. very ethnic and authentic chinese atmosphere, not so americanized.  the pot of tea was piping hot but especially delicious. the wonton chips were a good start. we went with the moo shoo pork and kung pao chicken, both pretty good. the crepes that the moo shoo pork came in were so soft and fluffy and the meat and seasonings were spot on. the kung pao chicken was a little water and not as spicy as i thought it was going to be. but it had peanuts, bamboo shoots, and my favorite chinese vegetable, water chestnuts...mmmm. the big bowl of rice we got was delicious as well.  and all for under $20. grubby good. especially for a city with lackluster chinese food.

i went here to workout with three of my friends who have pure fitness memberships hoping to get a free guest pass and was told that i either  a.) had to pay $10 to work out for one day  or  b.) take a tour with this overly-musculared douchey looking guy who would show me equipment, do my stats (really tell me how fat and out of shape i was), set up a program, and try to convince me to join the gym.  all i wanted to do was use the treadmill for an hour.  for lack of patience and humiliation, i opted for a and i didn't wipe my machine after my run.

this place is my absolute fav and anytime i'm near it i must stop in...  you can pack so much food into their bowls you seriously have lunch for work for the next three days.  the variety of food changes on a day-to-day basis, so sometimes when i go they don't have my favorite things (baby corn, water chestnuts), but i manage to cram 6 feet of food in my bowl anyways...  their sauce choices are very good and the staff working can usually help you with it as it may get a little confusing...be sure to add lots of chili sauce if you want it hot...  you can also get rice, won tons, soup, and a drink with your dinner..which is a great deal for $10.   if you're seriously stoned, go in. you won't be disappointed. and you won't be able to put your fork down long enough to talk to your friends about it either!!!

ASU students get free membership at the Y...challah! just had to because i'm jewish.  and don't in any way support christianity, but am more than willing to indulge in a free membership to their gym on ASU's dime...  the gym is your typical gym.  nothing special.  they have a nice amount of equipment and they keep the place clean.  the staff is really friendly.  they have a coffee/snack bar up front which i've never tried.  i've never done any of their classes either, or used anything besides the gym equipment.  but i looked around the place, they have a pool, handball courts, basketball court, and a track that goes outside and then comes back in which is pretty dope.    on my self guided tour i somehow ended up in the apartment area where they house all of the homeless people.  kind of scary, and really creepy. but they don't work out in the gym.  it's mostly a bunch of asu kids and downtowners.  nobody is staring you down cuz you're unfit or you're not lifting enough.  i like that.  so if you don't mind your occasional random bum pokin at you for change for booze, check out the y.

I came to Bikini Lounge with an open mind. I don't really visit many truly divey bars. creepy people well, creep me out. and I am a big believer in manners and some sort of bar respect.  the first time I came here, it was crowded, and I was meeting up with an old friend. conversating over a cheap pitcher of PBR amongst wanna-bes and bottom feeders, digging the funky music they were playing, made for a good evening.   the next time I came in, it was a totally different story. totally reeked of piss the second I walked in and over-crowded, "to catch a predator" show look-alike perverts loitering. fat greasy bum beast sitting at the bar, taking up two stools, not allowing me to get in and order. ten minutes of trying to get a brew, and we were out of there.  a mangy wild dog stood under a street light barking at us and my friend wigged out and we sheepishly made our way to the car. not a very good part of town either. be aware of kujo on 15th avenue!!!

mi patio has no patio. oxymoron?????   this would be a 5 star review minus the non-existent patio, which i believe is essential for sunday beer/margarita drinking. i've been here a few times and have never been disappointed. their food is good and cheap, and like all good and cheap mexican food, gives you the shits the next day. i ordered their appetizer sampler once, which was delicious and filled with lots of little tasty treats. their cheese enchiladas are gooey and delicious. everything comes with beans and rice. the beef tacos are shredded and come in crunchy shells, just how i like them. and the chips and salsa are never ending. mmmmmmmmm  their margaritas are delicious. i think it was like $10 for a big pitcher of them. they also have a variety of margaritas, not just plain ones (try strawberry, mmmm my fav, very tart), and a variety of other drinks as well. every time i've been in there drinking, they've given me and my friends a free shot. maybe so we drink more? who knows, but a free shot is a free shot.

MSB offers free pool all day on Sundays for college kids with ID. What a freaking deal!!! I can practice pool all day long in the air conditioned comfort of MSB. They have a ton of tables and the place was nearly dead empty when I went on Sunday. They rent out pool cues for a buck because people like to break them on the tables in frustration. So it's kind of a liability thing but I don't mind, I just paid NOTHING to shoot pool for as long as I want!  They have a ton of beers available as well, including my all time favorite, Newcastle, which was perfectly chilled and extremely refreshing and smooth. The guy up front was hella badass and made sure we always had a fresh Newcastle. I highly recommend this place.

so this place now serves sandwiches on their tasty bread. and for 6 bucks, you can get a sandwich, chips, and cookie. what a freaking deal!!!  they overload the sandwich with whatever meat you pick. like they pile that shit a mile high. i had to take some off cos i couldn't fit the damn thing in my mouth. i got the sunflower seed bread, which was some of the softest, most delicious bread i've ever had. TWO slices of cheese per half, and plenty of tasty chipotle sauce. i got an oatmeal raisin cookie which was huge and just soft enough.  if youre looking for a cheap, delicious, and filling sandhich - check this place out. they don't have many to choose from but you can never go wrong with classic turkey or tuna.

ive been working across the place for almost a year now and finally got a chance to sit down and have dinner. one of our customers once ordered us a bunch of pizza from here and i managed to grab a slice before it all ran out, and it remember it being fairly decent.  its very dark inside here, which sets a romantic mood. the decor is nice and everything looked well put together. the rolls were good and served with olive oil and parm. ice cold water, and our server was fast to greet us and get us started with a beer and a glass of wine. he showed us the specials for the day on the board, and we went with this chicken dish (forgot the name) to split (which he didnt end up charging us the $3 split plate fee for).  the dish arrived in a timely fashion with a side of penne pasta. it was 2 generous-sized chicken breasts stuffed with 3 different kinds of melted cheese served over this absolutely delicious sauce and spinach. i guess it could be similar to the french chicken cordon bleu and it absolutely blew coup des tarte's one (priced at $30, and only 1 breast) out of the water. if you love chicken, pasta, and cheese, you must try this. i just  wish i could remember what it was called.  we had a pricing problem which was easily adjusted by our server with no hassle.  all the servers in there are cute italian boys. the old woman seated at the table next to us drank way to much wine and was haphazardly flirting with our server.   can't wait to try more of their pasta, i will definitely be back!

Rio Salado is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my college career.  You would think that a school which is 100% focused upon online computer would have the best technology to provide its students with the best online learning experience. I have taken online classes through Arizona State University and Paradise Valley Community College and nothing compares to the numerous blackouts, server failures, and "page load errors" I encountered with this school.  I am a mac user and so are a million other people. it's not some rare, incompatible computer floating around in pawn shops and old computer stores in a dingy corner. many students are switching over to macs because they are more student friendly and tend to have a longer life and perform better than pc's. /end mac bias/ Rio Salado is extremely unfriendly to mac users.  The first thing they tell you is to download something other than Firefox or Safari, the two most popular browsers for Macs. They "prefer" internet explorer. And they tell us Mac'ers to download yet another web browser, Opera, to function properly on their servers. I hate Opera, and don't want to have to downlaod anything more than I need.  Even with Opera, I still get plenty of errors and have spoken with the technology help desk on at least 5 occasions in an 8 week course period. It is very frustrating when a system fails that your grade is dependent upon. I have to adjust my schedule around when Rio Salado Online is going to be functioning properly.  Also, I tried to take a Spanish class this semester, and the notice under the course description said that the software they use is not compatible with mac computers. How unfair is that?  Rio has been one of the worst learning experiences I have ever had.

There is no place/business I have visited more in Arizona than Arizona State University and I think I should give you my honest opinion on it as my 100th review and as I finish up my final year here and get ready to accept my diploma.  My first year at ASU, like most freshman, was spent at the dorms. What a crazy experience. I shared a room with my best friend in Palo Verde Main and we lucked out and didn't have to share a bathroom with any of the drunk, obnoxious, party bimbos that lived on our floor.  Don't forget about the douchebag wannabe jock dickheads on our floor too, that would be up until 4am screaming obscenities and running up and down the hall with underwear on their heads. PV Main is a freaking DUMP HOLE compared to the new resort-style dorms that these spoiled brats are living in now-a-days. Minus the people in my dorm, I enjoyed living in PV Main, due to the close proximity to my classes, grocery store downstairs, and abundance of parking. The bunk style beds were rather obnoxious, seeing as how being extremely intoxicated makes it ridiculously difficult to climb up to the bunk and then have a no-spin sleep. I moved my mattress to the floor when my roomie moved out.  I have generally had good professors while at ASU. My 2nd semester at school I had chosen my major, Women and Gender Studies, and my minor, Sociology. ASU also offers a certificate in LGBT Studies which I will be obtaining as well. In both fields I have learned more than I ever could have imagined and have grown incredibly as a person. I have met so many rad, intellectually stimulating, and down to earth people. Sometimes the larger classes (300+) can be a little overwhelming but as long as you pay attention and turn in assignments on time you're golden. Some of the classrooms are nicer than others but none were every disgustingly dirty. COOR lecture halls are great for naps during boring classes (CSE180) and the bottom level of Murdock is 100 times nicer than the top level. My favorite professors have been Michelle Vlahoulis in Women's Studies, Shelley Erickson in Women's/Justice Studies and Richard Fey in Sociology. Take any of their classes if you can. They're very inspiring and motivating, and actually care. Some of the gen ed classes can be rather mind-numbing but look up your professors on ratemyprofessor.com to get a good idea of what they're like. Most of the reviews are dead on.   The campus is huge, it's easy to get lost if you don't know you way around, but maps are abundant. The Memorial Union is huge and filled with yummy places to eat and a downstairs lounge with pool tables and a bowling alley. My favorite place to eat is the Extreme Pita on the first floor. Sometimes these places can get a little pricey but that's the price you pay for convenience. There are also lots of nooks and crannies to get comfortable in to study in the MU, as well as the library, which is full of books and great study spots, and usually pretty quiet. Out in front of the MU there is always something going on - sometimes bands playing, clubs promoting, free give-a-ways, United Blood Drives, and of course, my absolute favorite spectacle, the far-out religious lunatics carrying signs and shouting bible verses explaining why homosexuality is a sin.  And the rowdy students that gather round and have some [educated] fun with them.  They have a rec center on campus as well, with a work out room, pool, tennis and basketball courts, everything you would want in a rec center and then some. And it's free for ASU students! So screw paying $30 a month for a gym if you're a student. And it's pretty cheap for non-students to get in as well, if you have any friends that want to accompany you. Walking around campus can be a bit hectic, as this school is HUGE (3rd largest in the nation).  What makes it even more difficult is all of the bikers/skateboarders that zoom past you with no regards as to where you are walking. And everyone is either plugged into their ipod or cell phone so no one is paying attention to anyone else around them.    My biggest problem with ASU is what money-hungry whores the school officials are. Rising tuition, we all know about it. Parking costs. $380 to park in a giant lot a mile and a half away from campus? Seriously? They have a bus that takes you to campus but still! You have to arrive at least 30 minutes before you class to make sure you get there on time. What a hassle! Parking meters are difficult considering they are on a 60 minute limit and most classes exceed that amount of time. What gives? I've gotten more parking tickets than A's at this school.   Overall though, my ASU experience has been a pretty good one. I picked this school over NAU and UA because I wanted to stay in Phoenix and I liked the big campus and extreme variety of classes they offer. I wouldn't trade my experience and the knowledge I have gained over the past 4 years for anything in the world.   Go Devils!

dilly's has to be one of my favorite sandwich shops of all time. they have such a wide variety of choices that anyone who comes can pick something to suit their taste buds.   i always go for the blazin buffalo because i eat wing sauce on nearly everything. boars head meats on all their sandwiches which is great but jacks the price up quit a bit. a sandwich, drink, and a side was about $10. i went with the pasta salad as a side, which was nothing special, your average run of the mill pasta salad. my sandwich on this particular visit was lacking a sufficient amount of buffalo sauce and i neglected to ask for extra before i left, assuming that they wouldn't be stingy with it. the bread is good, they toast it so it tends to get soggy if you take it to go. the bread bowls are good too, i've had the clam chowder and chicken noodle and i recommend both.  service here is usually quite slow. even when it's not busy in there, like today around 2, i had to wait 10 minutes to get my sandwich and even saw some guy who was two people behind me get his order before me. when it's busy, you're going to be waiting even longer. they need to pick up the pace.

i'm not a vegan or a vegetarian, i thoroughly enjoy sinking my teeth into a thick juicy piece of medium-rare steak. and i love eggs in the morning and chicken tacos at 2am. i am also very hesistant to try anything the attempts to substitute for meat, because i think it's just psychologically strange. BUT ever since my friend turned me onto green about 2 years ago, i've had nearly everything on the menu. and never been disappointed or grossed out by anything.  my favorites: number one absolutely has to be the mexi-cali burger. i could eat these everyday. it has the flame-broiled taste of a real burger and even the bright red color of raw meat, but don't let it freak you out. it also comes with hummus, bright orange nacho cheese, and chipotle sauce. this burger is SPIIICCYYYY so beware. their fries are crispy and perfectly seasoned. also love their soy ice cream treats, soy-namis, my favorite being the raisin with captain crunch. their lime-ade, lemon-ade, and teas are always fresh and delicious. i also love the diablo red bowl which is another dish for spicy-lovers and comes with fresh roasted eggplant (yummmm) and tomatos.   their pita chips and hummus are to die for. they're crispy chips which i enjoy better than just a regular pita being served with hummus. and their buffalo wings are almost as good as the real thing.  green nails vegetarian and healthy mock ups of american food right on the head.

casey moore's is great for their happy hour - a few bucks off appetizers and all beer is 3 bucks. they have lots of beers on tap including my favorite, newcastle. i usually come here to grub after i get out of class.  the appetizers are great - fried zucchini, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings - all very tasty and delicious. their sandwiches are pretty good as well. at my last dining experience i ordered the fish and chips, which were rubbery and basically inedible. the waitress had them remade and they were alright.   the problem with casey moore's is the service. you seat yourself and then you wait 10-15 minutes for a waitress to approach you. last time i was there our server was gone half the time and it took about 25 minutes to even get our orders in. i think i've had ok service one time. and usually in the afternoon's its fairly slow so there is no excuse for bad service. i really don't get it. maybe it's because we always sit outside and the waitress's are running tables inside and outside, but i really doubt that caused my 25 minute food wait. it's just plain bad.

This was hands down, the best pizza I've ever had...I ordered a white pizza with the spicy pepperoni on it and it arrived looking like a beautiful piece of artwork..almost too pretty to eat, but i had to...we ate the whole thing, and downed a bottle of wine..we also had the banana crepe for dessert which you can't leave without having a bite....try their nut brown ale...very delicious, especially during the winter time...the place was jam-packed when we went in there but we got a seat at the bar and had our pizza and wine, which was absolutely fine with us..awesome place to take a date..

took my mom, grandma, and the mrs. here for the kickoff to my birthday weekend. my family doesn't experience much downtown (they're *gag* scottsdale) so i chose cibo as the perfect introduction to the wonderful cuisine and atmosphere cen pho offers.   went at 6pm on a friday night and the wait wasn't bad - maybe 15-20 minutes. it wasn't too crowded in there so we managed to huddle around the bar and have a drink and chat for a bit before we were seating. i had almost forgotten how absolutely charming this place was - you feel very at home inside, and it makes for a comfortable meal and dining experience.  although the service wasn't as good as i expected it to be - our waiter disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on us very often - it wasn't bad enough to the point of knocking the place down a star.   first up came the bread and olive oil, and when we asked for butter, we were denied because they didn't have any. what restaurant doesn't have butter? we ordered two salads to share - the house salad and the pear salad. both were superb. the large chunks of parmigiano  on the house salad were tasty as was the balsamic dressing - not too much and not too little - just right. we went with two pizzas, a red and a white. the capriciossa and the other one i forgot the name (it had fontina cheese and pepperoni, and it's not on the online menu). the white pizza was definitely  my favorite, as i am not a fan of pizza with a lot of toppings. i just can't get over how delicious these pizzas are - the crispy wood-fired crust and the cheesiest of cheeses - cooked to perfect. we couldn't leave without desert, and settled on the nutella and fresca. both were to die for; i prefered the fruitiness of the fresca to the somewhat overly sweet nutella.   oh how i heart your pizza, cibo. no need to try pizzeria bi-crappo, you treat me and my taste buds perfectly.

normally i do not venture to party outside of my central phoenix neighborhood. but i jumped at the opportunity to see faux punk, a daft punk dj cover crew, at axis-radius. saw the ad for it in the new times, and they included a write up to comment on how cool this daft punk replica was, and that they featured a space ship stage, daft punk-style helmets, laser lights, and used all the same touch equipment that the real punks use. with only a $5 dollar cover. sounded cool to me, so a few friends and i headed out to scottsdale for an unforgettable night of douchbagery.  upon arrival at axis radius, we found no parking and had to valet for $7. we got in line and were told there was a $10 cover. i told the door guy that the new times said it was $5, and he told me to show him. i was taken back, and joked to him as to why the hell i would carry a new times around with me to the bar. refusing to pay $10 to get in, we walked out of line and approached some important-looking security management people who let us in for $5. we got inside, at around midnight, figuring we were gonna be right on time to see faux punk start. they were nowhere in sight. both dj's downstairs were not playing daft punk, and i saw no spaceship stage.   i asked AT LEAST 5 security guards (there are like 50 of them in here to ensure no one gets their ed hardy shirts ripped off or their veneers knocked out) and bartenders and no one seemed to know who the fuck i was talking about, nor knew of the event really. if your club is hosting an event that you've been promoting all across the valley, don't you think you'd school your employees on what was going on? how did no one in that whole fuckin place have no clue what i was talking about?  we finally got ahold of a bottle girl walking around who told us that the faux punk DJs were UPSTAIRS performing, which was the VIP area. what. the. fuck. they finally came downstairs to perform about 20 minutes later, minus the spaceship stage and cool daft punk replica instruments. and their helmets were motorcycle helmets covered in duck tape.  drinks were way overpriced, two vodka drinks came out to $23. plus a $1 credit card usage charge.   i was afraid to leave my girlfriends side for fear one of the 10,000 single guys in the room would verbally rape her.  i don't know whose fault this whole mess was, but i'm going to blame all of the sources. axis radius for their lack of communication. the promotions company for being hella unclear. and the new times for dragging me to the epicenter of sausage fest 3000.

so the quest is finally over.  i have found my hangover breakfast spot.  although not hungover on this occasion, i believe that matt's will fit the bill for my greasy big breakfast need after a long night.  came in around 11am, because i can never seem to make it up before 10, and there was no wait and we were greeted and seated right away. started with a coffee which was SO good, some of the best diner/breakfast coffee i have ever had. i went with the salami and egg scramble with hashbrowns and sourdough toast, and my friend went with the chick and hog with bacon and home fries. the food came up pretty fast and i dug in.  fantastic.  the eggs were cooked perfectly and the salami was out of this world. the hashbrowns were a little greasy but i mixed everything together and it balanced out. a little tabasco sauce, and i had one bomb breakfast. i tried my friends bacon and it was phenomenal. crispy, thick, and peppery. delicious. their oj is like drinking straight out of an orange. the toast was great, and their jam was just the right amount of sweet. their portions are HUGE, i couldn't even finish my breakfast. my friend was as impressed as i was. it wasn't overwhelming loud inside like some small joints are known to be (like over easy...) and it wasn't crammed at all, even though the place looks incredibly tiny from the outside!  excellent service, stellar food, cool atmosphere, all for only $20 plus tip. i'm jumping on the matt's bandwagon.

this place is probably as authentic as you can get, i heard the owners are syrian and they are serious about their food.   the owner was bitching to me about the ridiculous charges on his aps bill while i was waiting for my gyros. he also gave me a tea in a glass while i waited plus an iced tea to go. very friendly and outgoing.   the place is cute inside, small but looks like it would hold more than you think. i love small businesses like this - it makes me feel better knowing my money is going to support a family owned small business rather than a sweatshop of a chain restaurant.   i ordered the gyros and DAMN that thing came LOADED, so i asked for an extra pita to make a second sandwich for lunch tomorrow. the pita was fried i think, it was crispy soft and hot and the gyros was some of the best i've ever had. not too dry and not too tenderly juicy. the tzatki sauce was superb but the sandwich could have done without the onions or tomatoes they load on it (easy to pick off).  seeing as how i work next to this place, i'm sure i'll be back to try more of their greek delights.

umm, so i was really stoked to try this place, and stopped by there one day after class. terrible parking situation, i had no idea where to park and didnt want to get towed. after driving around for 10 minutes trying to figure out which way was out and where i could park tow-free, i walked up and was extremely confused as to where the door to get in was. the one i tried to open was locked, and another one up front said use other door. it really bothers me when business are a.) difficult to find and b.) difficult to get in to.  three roots. FAIL.

ok, so i've never actually stayed in a room here, i only come to be a freeloader in their pool and indulge in their mojitos and guacamole, so my review is based on the aforementioned only. but my experiences at the clarendon pool as a guest have been less than satisfactory, worthy of a yelp review in hopes that they will get their act together.  my friends and i came to the pool one night around 10pm for a drink and a dip and were treated like shit by the bartender (who happens to be "family").  apparently she was closing down the bar and couldn't make us mojitos or any other mixed drink, only beer. and when i went to pay with a debit card, her comment was "oh, you just HAD to go and do this to me, didn't you?" what? pay for my drink? i wanted to chuck the beer in her face and tell her to have it back. my friends ended up not ordering from the wicked bitch of the clarendon and headed out to the pool drink-less.   the next time i was here the pool area was a freaking mess. there was not one chair or table that had been cleaned or spared from the disaster of the prior party that day. cups, plates, towels, scattered everywhere.  if i were an actual guest staying at the hotel, i would have been appalled.  but as a non-paying guest i felt as though i didn't really have a legitimate say in the condition of the pool, but i told the guy at the front desk anyways. he was a total jackass and blankly stared at me while i asked him kindly if he could clean up the pool. he told me he would send someone out to clean it up, but that never happened.    their guac is grand and usually their drinks are decent. the beer selection is limited and really needs a face lift. but basically, this place has gone downhill. in times of recession you should care 50 times more what your place looks like to stand out above the rest. obviously the clarendon doesn't. and they want to start charging people $10 a day to use their pool starting june 1st. HA. what a joke. clean up your act clarendon.

this place deserves five stars just for the convenience of being open until MIDNIGHT, when every other [too-cool trendy] places close at 8 or 9.   another amazing thing about unlimited is that they have four extremely comfy sofas in the back that i like to get lost in for hours. plus, outlets everywhere!!! i don't know how many other cenpho coffee shops i've been into that are lacking a proper amount of electrical plugs. it's really a hassle.   their coffee and teas are pretty good. i like that they have 20+ syrups to choose from to flavor your coffee. i usually get an iced with peanut butter and grape syrup. they have a good selection of pastries as well and the blueberry muffin is to die for. also offered is gelato, their mascarpone crunch is so creamy and tasty i just want to take a swim in a pool of it.  way to go unlimited. you are my coffee joint.

you know what makes this place so awesome? they sell gluten-free beer called redbridge(made by anheuser busch). you heard it right. beer without wheat or barley. sounds crazy but it's actually quite good - somewhere between a light blue moon and kiltlifter. and it's only $2 from 4-7 (along with all of their wine and beer).   very cute, quaint atmosphere in this shopping center filled with gems. the place is quite large with lots of seating and a view-while-they make it style kitchen. the possibilities are endless for their pizzas. i went with 2 apps (which were 1/2 off during happy hour) - the breaded ravioli and pesto sticks- and a pepperoni, jalepeno, and 3-cheese blend pizza on foccacia bread.   the guy at the register was super friendly and suggested i try that gluten free beer - i'll admit i was hesitant at first and i had faith he wouldn't lead me wrong. our pizza and apps were served to us when we sat down. everything was delicious. the breaded raviolis were my fav. i've never had a pizza on foccacia bread before but i'd order it again. it was the perfect size to split between my girlfriend and i and we walked out of there full and happy - and only $14 poorer. cheap good pizza and beer. go pie zanos.

so my girlfriend HATES chinese and I LOVE it. i of course am that one that suffers due to an insufficient intake of chinese food. BUT i did my gilfriend a huge favor and she in turn bought me dinner, and wanted to give this place a shot, mostly because we were tired and didn't want to go anywhere and they deliver (!!!!!!!!).   well, my extremely picky chinese-food hating girlfriend actually dug the meal. she ordered the lemon chicken (sauce on the side, extra lemon wedges) and white rice, and i got the szchewaun chicken combo with lo mein, fried rice, crab puff, and egg roll. my other friend who was with us went with the kung pao chicken combo. all three were equally amazing. well, I didn't too much care for the dry "lemon" chicken that my gf ordered, but she is hella picky and they made it just how she likes it so she was happy with hers. I was very satisfied with my spicy szchewaun chicken that came with zucchini, peppers, and water chestnuts, and was even more impressed by the delicious lo mein on the side. rice is rice, it was good.  great price and great food. definitely my go to chinese place now. and i'm even more excited that i'll be able to eat it more often now that they've satisfied a previous chinese food hater. yay siu wok!

i've seriously had hot pockets that tasted better than the pastie i got here last night. i ordered the royale, and i don't know if it was the mushrooms, or the seasoning they use on the burger, but something was off and it left a yucky taste in my mouth for hours after i ate it.  i am a very picky eater, and the pastes cannot be modified. most of them (90%) contain onions or some other strange vegetable that i don't like so it's really not a good place to go unless you like a ton of shit thrown in a pastie. i think it's too much sometimes. the mashed potatoes were dry and not very garlic-y whatsoever.  our waiter was an asshole. i ordered a black and tan with strongbow and a nut ale and he informed me that they wouldn't be good together. refusing to take some douchebag's advice, i ordered it anyways and it was delicious. he didn't care to check on our table at all throughout our meal, and no waters were brought to the table...halfway through we got switched to a very nice young lady. i didn't mind the set up of the bar, it was very english pub-like and actually enjoyed the atmosphere. the beer selection is impressive.  i was disappointed after all of the great yelp reviews, i was expected to be blown away by these delicious little tasty treats - unfortunately they just didn't get it right this time.

it makes me really sad to see so many poor reviews for this place because i had an excellent dining experience here and hope to have many more. to those who didn't enjoy their tanked fish visit, i'd suggest you give it another go.  my favorite thing about sushi is the happy hour and i appreciate any sushi place that offers a good deal on sushi. ALL DAY on tuesdays and thursdays tanked offers about 10 rolls on their happy hour - plus $5 "guppy bowls" (i'll explain this in a moment). plus half off sake and and other such spirits.   now this guppy bowl thing is served in a plastic fishbowl ice cold and consists of about 7 or 8 different drinks/liquors. they shove a big straw in the middle and dare you to finish it before all of your friends do. ONE of these had me buzzing. quite possibly the most amazing drink i've ever been served at a restaurant..the only thing it was lacking was fake fish floating in it. to start we picked the edamame, which we were told could be topped with spicy buffalo sauce. these were eye-watering and tongue burning hot, but delicious none-the-less. we ordered 6 different rolls - the las vegas, the cougar, spicy crab, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, philly, and the classic california roll. all were on happy hour except the las vegas ($13) and cougar ($14). i'd say the las vegas was definately the best, closely followed by the cougar, which was a mix of crab, shrimp, and something else, wrapped in cucumber (instead of soy paper). all of the other rolls were equally delicious, fresh, and perfectly sized. 3 of us split all of these rolls plus 3 guppy bowls and it was $25 each (including tip).  too bad this place isn't more centrally located (like in phoenix), but its worth the drive.

"tanked fish is now closed due to economic recession."  my excitement for cheap delicious sushi and guppy bowl goodness was deflated into a shriveling sack of sadness on this tuesday evening.  so in honor of tanked's unbeatable happy hour, sweet atmosphere, and splendid sushi, i shall say my final words and wave goodbye solemnly as yet another incredible phoenix restaurant goes under the table due to poor economic conditions caused by politicians running amuck and unchecked in washington. i've had enough guppy bowls from you to fill an aquarium. not to mention fish to fill it with.  may you and your delicious bowls of blue alcoholic wonderousness (i never knew quite what was in them) rest in peace.

I love this place. For several reasons.  It's an old house converted perfectly into a bar.  They use the space well and I always feel comfy, cozy, and welcome inside.  The artwork on the walls never ceases to amaze and inspire me.  They have a chalkboard above the beer cooler telling you the specials, as well as the musical stylings of the evening.  The lighting is good, not too dark, and there are tables and chairs to kick it with the homies and a small dance area for gettin down.  Their beer selection is incredible.  They carry many of my favorites (Xingu, Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout, Strongbow, 8th St Ale, Hebrew Messiah Bold) as well as a grip of others to test and try.  Last night I went with the 3 Philosophers brew, a dark ale with a bite as big as Plato, Socrates, and Comte's contributions to rational thought (9.8% alc/vol, they're not fucking around here).  I also tried the Raspberry Dark Brown Ale which was dark, smooth, and not overwhelming fruity like many lighter fruit beers can be.    Tuesday nights are Downtime at the Lost Leaf.  The musical stylings of the DJs during Downtime can best be described as low-key down tempo funk shui originality. Relax sit back and hand me a chilled out bone crunching bass-busting groove to soothe my nerves.  An accurate mix of hip hop, drum and bass, and electro.  You can feel the good vibes flowing throughout the bar when the DJ spins some Caspa mixtape shit. It's definitely a chilled atmosphere driven by the needle of the record.  On a side note, I want to apologize for my friend who puked in front of the bathroom a couple months ago. I took her outside for fresh air and apparently the DJs called her out hardcore for doing it.  She's a lightweight, not experienced in the exquisite alcoholicness of the brews you guys serve.    If you're from out of town, I highly recommend you check out the Lost Leaf.  You'll get the true, raw downtown urban vibe that Phoenix so exclusively offers.

It took my girlfriend nearly 9 months after hearing about my love for peanut butter to mention this place and take me here. how could she have forgotten? i could put peanut butter on anything and everything, even her toes and i'd lick it off. but you really aren't reading this to hear about my kinkiness, so i'll stick to writing about food.  we got the PB sampler which was probably the best idea, considering you can try 3 different kinds of PB with in, in generous amounts. it came on a plate loaded with pretzels, carrots, celery, and apples. delicious and healthy. we got the banana mocha, cookie dough, and raspberry white chocolate. all deliciously creamy almost to the point of orgasm..that's how good.  will def be coming back to try one of their crazy sandwhich combos.

it is so incredibly easy to get dance-happy wasted in this friday night boogie spot.  last night they offered $1 tootsie roll shots. i think we managed to get three in the mere 30 minutes they were offered. sometime after the third shot, my conversation with the bartender went something like this:  me: "um, can i get another shot, but not that tootsie roll thingy?" bartender: "no." me: "so that's the only shot for $1?" bartender: "yes." me: "you can't just give me something else? please?" bartender: "no." me: "ok. fine. another one." bartender: "no. that was only for 1/2 an hour." me: "what. the fuck."  are you the freaking shot nazi?   whatever, they have $2 cans of pbr that will get you piss-ass drunk. i think they're more alcoholic at homme than anywhere else. or maybe it was just all of those tootsie roll shots. the music is fantazmo, probably the best place to here electro house music. the dance floor gets a little thin during some points in the night, but buy the dj a pbr and he will play something rad like la roux's "in for the kill" (skream's let's get ravey remix) and people will make their way back on to get down.

Not one person has reviewed this Fry's on yelp? Serial?  This is my Fry's. You can usually catch me slumming it around in here late at night, cooling off in the beer aisle or debating for 10 minutes with myself on whether or not I want to get Friday the 13th or What Happens in Vegas out of the RedBox machine. Or I could be at the deli counter, getting some delicious Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  Even better yet, you can find me scoping out all the "manager special" deals where items are usually discounted up to 50% due to expiration approaching.  Usually I have an advertisement in my hands with the best deals this Fry's has to offer. Most of the time, it's the cheapest, cleanest, safest, and most reasonable place to grocery shop in the 85014-18 area code.    That said, I have two main concerns with this store: - that every time I go they seem to be out of the 6-pack of eggs, as well as a lot of their diary products. They are not very good about keeping "hot" items on their shelves stocked.   -their produce selection is very limited, and the prices are really nothing to jump overboard about. I go to Ranch Market or Whole Foods to get my produce on.  But I'm not gonna talk shit, and I refuse to grocery shop anywhere else really. Safeway, Albertsons - overpriced. Fresh and Easy, Sprouts, Sunflower - not much of a selection, and again, a little pricey. Fry's meets all of my grocery shopping needs, from toilet paper to tampons to spaghetti-o's.

I love Hungry Howies for a couple reasons-  cajun crust CHEAP fast hot wing sauce 3 cheesier bread   and of course, deliciousness.   this place gets my pizza ready in about 15 minutes...bad thing is they don't deliver past 24th street...  always very friendly, prompt, clean, and i have never been disappointed. you'll never eat another dominos pizza again!

*cut to scene* Friday night, lounging around discussing the lameness of the evening, ready to indulge in a new adventure. six pack of Newcastle sits untouched in fridge and bellys aching for fulfillment. yelp.com search reveals a local japanese eatery nearby.   enter, Hana.  first off, pre-game excitement for this BYOB, local, fresh sushi spot. Newcastle in hand, my friend and I strutted in here at around 8pm on a mildly warm Friday night. the place is jammed, and a couple parties stand around waiting for tables. great, a long wait. nope, two seats open at the bar. sat down, and our beer was immediately taken and put in a fridge to ensure it wouldn't lose any of it's remarkably smooth quality.  first beer is poured, and the excitement ensues. friendly and welcoming server devluges us in the specials, and unfortunately they were out of most of their fish as they have been for three weeks. toro and salmon were our options, so we went with a special for the night, the spider roll, and the vegas roll. also, edamame to start.  the food was superb. the edamame came spicy with a side of chili flakes and siracha for our never ending quest to burn the shit out of our mouths. a second round of newcastle was brought upon when our first was finished, and the sushi came shortly thereafter, looking like little pieces of art. both sets of rolls were enormous and came about 6 to a plate. the vegas roll was packed with cream cheese, avocado, and salmon. the special roll, the spider roll, was full of crispy soft shell crab and just enough spicy-ness for a much needed kick in the mouth. one dip in my wasabi/soy sauce concoction was more than enough.  our third and final beer was poured by an overly-anxious and over-stimulated, presumably newbie, bus boy. I had about 4 inches of head on my beer and my friend got hers spilled and nearly twice as much head.  he excellent waitress we had made up for this guys slips during the meal. the staff wished us a nice farewell on our way out, and I felt as though I had just left a very close friend's house.   I will definitely be back with more six packs and good friends to share this little diamond in the rough with.

I want so bad for BarSmith to be a hangout for my friends and I. It's right downtown, it's got two different dance floors, they play good music, it draws a [supposedly] hip crowd, and they have a rooftop bar.  Unfortunately, they fail on so many levels.   First off, to get to BarSmith, you have to walk past a sketch as hell nightclub full of dudes mean muggin you and chicks with skin tight, unattractively short dresses hollerin for attention.  oh yeah, and all of the bums lined up begging for change that harass you until you get to the door. When I walked in the door last night, the foul odor of vomit, piss, sweat, and farts nearly blew me back out. It was almost unbearable.  And the cliche hip hop music, with the DJ's hype man yelling "All the single ladies let me hear you!!!" so all of the guys knew which chicks were horny and available for the picking. Thankfully they separate the two parts of the bar, and we took the stairs to the top to find it completely packed with more obnoxious drunk people.  Electro music banging from the speakers and people were chatting it up. I made my way to the bar, only to discover ONE bartender, and NO MORE CHERRY VODKA. I was substituted SKYY vodka for the SAME PRICE as 3 Olives (?!@#@?#) and redbull brought two drinks to a total of 17 fucking dollars.  Who are you trying to be BarSmith? $8.50 for a redbull/skyy? And the bartender's pouring skills sucked because the drinks tasted awful and were way too weak, not even filled to the top.  And to top it all off, there was some creepy as fuck, drunk as fuck, 40-something year old heterosexual white male getting all up on mine and my friends shit, being a drunk fool, and security was nowhere to be seen. I saw a group of guys acknowledging and encouraging his stupid ass drunk behavior as well.  I've been to BarSmith a couple times before, and experienced the douchebagery of a lot of the guys that go here, whether it's discrimination based on sexuality/gender, or just them being plain macho jacked up assholes. It's like the Scottsdale Ed Hardy douche vibe in downtown pseudo-hipster form.  Really, really disappointing.

Wow, what a disappointment Bertha's turned out to be.  First off, they need to take the sign down from their old location, which I went to, and drove around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for the place.  Second, their online menu is not current. I went here because of the tasty-sounding Buffalo Chicken wrap which they no longer have. (The menu picture that someone posted on Yelp is way too tiny to read)  Third, they forgot my fruit salad ($3) which I didn't realize until I had drive all the way home. I called to inform them of their mishap and the woman on the phone was confused as to what they forgot. She kept asking me what I ordered and didn't understand that THEY FORGOT MY FRUIT SALAD. Ugh. Annoyed.  Fourth, my salami was served on a stale ciabatta, It was overloaded with goat cheese on one half and skimped on the other.  The amount of salami was skimpy as well.  Fifth, the sandwiches don't come with chips.  I am a firm believer that all sandwiches should come with a side, and I am grateful to places that include them in the price.  Sixth, the red velvet cupcakes were dry and the frosting was mediocre.  Not cream cheesy at all.  6 mishaps and Bertha's gets one star.   On a good note, their cookie that came with the sandwich was delicious, as was their passion tea.  Don't waste your time.

switch really impressed me the first time i went there for the yelp elite event. i decided to check it out on my own, and a friend and i came for happy hour one evening because she had a gift certificate here.  we sat out on their patio, which is kind of odd, because it's like half tables/half patio lounge-ish, and it's located at the "front" (well technically the back) of the restaurant so everyone has to walk through said patio area (which is rather narrow) to get into the restaurant. so you really don't have a cool view of anything from their patio, besides the people walking in. yawn.  anyways, they have these daily, ALL DAY LONG, $1.99 DRINK and FOOD specials. the waitress gave me a card listing them and what they are on certain days. i won't bore you with them all (Call and ask) but on saturday night when we went it was $1.99 COSMOS in 3 flavors and half off specialty drinks and drunk italian sodas because of the 4-6:30 happy hour. what a STEAL!!!!! if you are looking for a place to drink and eat before you start out your crazy evening, switch definitely would be my recommendation.  i got this mojito like drink that was HUGE and refreshingly delicious and only like $3. and 2 cosmos for $4. that's 3 PREMIUM drinks for $7 folks. unbeatable.  the food is amazing as well. there is something for everyone on their menu. i went for the mozzarella caprese, because i had tried a sample of it at the yelp event and dreamt about it nearly every night thereafter. it came with a cesar salad on the side, and i just want to say thank you switch for not feeding me fattening greasy fries and filling me up on the crisp, refreshing, deliciousness of a simple cesar salad. the sandwich...mind blowing. even better than i remember it. seriously. the best. mozzarella and tomato sandwich. around. i don't even want to try anything else on the menu ever, because i am so in love with this sandwich. i would have never thought a vegatarian option, let alone something that basic could leave my palette, my stomach, and my mind so completely satisfied.  mozzarella caprese, will you marry me? better yet, can i just rest my head in your delicate mozzarella, lettuce, and tomato bed?

I've been to Switch at least a dozen times since my first experience at the Yelp event.  Mostly for the $1.99 drink specials they offer and the outdoor patio.  The food is usually satisfying, even the $1.99 paninis they sometimes advertise.  Service has always been good, but not great.  However, I visited Switch last week with two of my friends after First Friday, and I don't even want to go back after the sub-par experience I had.  The waitress was HORRIBLE. Extremely unfriendly, rude, cold, impersonal, basically ignored us the whole time, took forever to get our drinks, and didn't spare a second to make sure we had everything (or ANYTHING for that matter) we needed. She seemed more concerned with closing the restaurant down then making sure her table was taken care of. as for the food, it didn't get any better really.  I went with the french dip which lacked any flavor or bite to it.  It was room temperature when it came out.  The cheese had gone from ooey-gooey melted to wax-like.  Luckily I swapped halves with my friend who got the buffalo chicken sandwich (decent).  We ordered the sunrise magaritas which you could tell were made with cheap ass tequila and WAY too much of it. make them smaller and use better tequila and i think you'd be better off.  but fo realz, what the hell Switch? You killed my buzz for the evening and ruined my first friday. I didn't even want to tip the waitress and my friends ended up leaving her a substantial sum of money she should use to buy some lithium. Lesson learned. I should have waited an hour for Moira.

Ok, so forget about going here to get new (well sort of) threads guys- NBE seems to be quite a little gem for finding those oddball things you never seem to know where to find. Looking for a zombie brain jello mold for your Halloween party? NBE has one!  How about a nightlight with Rosie the Riveter on it "We Can Do It!" for your funky smelling hippie feminist friend?  I bought one for myself!  Fake moustache to hide your identity while driving past the pesky speed cameras on the freeway? It wasn't you! NBE has them in a pack of 5 different styles including a jumbo 'stache and commie style!  Tiny Asian-made and Asian-size tweezers only used by the best nail techs in all of central phoenix! Complete with tiny Asian heart clip to keep them secure and safe. .99 at NBE!!!  Do I need to say more? Seriously, hair ties in every size shape and color, dirt cheap plugs in a variety of styles, and a cute counter girl that laughed at my unpatriotic 4th of July joke.  It's really worth the drive to Mesa (yes it still is a city).

i don't know what they put in their food, but in n out can cure even the worst of hangovers. i'm talking level 5, head hanging over the toilet, don't know whether to puke or poop, head pounding, can't get up, kind of hangover. i will get up (or make my girlfriend take me) to in n out to remedy the hangover that the previous nights debauchery has left me with.  the menu is so simple and that is the true joy of in n out. i don't need the fancy schmancy double pound bacon western burger or the jalepeno triple patty annhilator. all i need is a classic cheesburger and a side of fries. or if i'm feeling adventurous, i get my fries animal style, covered in cheese, grilled onions, and that delicious special sauce. i think it might be the sauce that cures me, cuz no other burger can remedy my hangovers. my girlfriend is a vegetarian and gets a grilled cheese animal style, which is stuffed to the brim with cheese, veggies, special sauce, and grilled onions. so good i forget that it doesn't have meat in it, and is instant gratification for my stomach and head.  always great customer service, drive thru can be long, but it's worth the wait. and in the 50+ times that i've been there, they've never messed up my order. great service, great food.

i did a double dip at thai hut in one week. i couldn't help myself. extremely generous portions (enough for two people) at reasonable prices, fast, efficient service, and just enough tacky asian feel to suck me in.  the coconut curry chicken was amazing. not too sweet either (as it can be made). came with a large plate of rice. pad ped with chicken could have be a notch spicier (ask for thai hot when you order so you can feel your intestines burn) but the red curry paste it came in was extremely tasty. this also came with rice.  my next visit (to go, ready in just 10 minutes) was an order of their spicy fried rice with chicken. it came with sliced peppers (hold the onions) and was just spicy enough for me. delicious.  best thai food in phoenix.

I stop here almost every morning on my way to work...the drive thru is extremely convenient and there is never a wait...which is surprising, because this is some of the best coffee i've ever had...  the staff is super friendly and the place is unique...to say the least!  i get an iced americano usually, and the sweet hawaiin flavors of the espresso are brough out by the raw sugar i add to it...way better than a starbucks americano for sure!!!

i just finished licking my fingers clean and almost ate the dressing-drenched paper that held my very first, and surely not last, lucky boy international burger.  crispy bun, tons of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and onions, and a perfectly tender, smokey burger. thick, perfectly salted, crunchy on the outside and soft and burning hot on the inside fries. thick and deliciously sweet chocolate and peanut butter shake.  gone. in less than 5 minutes.  place closes early, so unfortunately there will be no drunk trips through the dangerously narrow drive thru.

best gyros in phoenix.   for 8 bucks, you get a huge gyros sandwich filled with tasty tzatziki, onions and tomatos on the softest pita bread i've ever had, along with a huge side of crispy seasoned fries and a soft drink with free refils. my friend got the vegetarian falafel sandwich combo which they let her customize and get dolmadas and spanikopita as her sides. along with a delicious greek salad. the falafel wasn't dry and too crunchy, they were soft and perfectly crisp little morsels of greek deliciousness.  take my word. i'm from chicago and grew up with a greek family. i know my gyros.

after disappointingly discovering that matt's big breakfast is closed on mondays (l-a-m-e), my girlfriend and i headed off to over easy to grab a hearty breakfast.  we got there at 10:40 on a monday morning, and waited 15 minutes for a table. a group of business men, whom the hostess told us were the boss's "friends" barged in 10 minutes after us (before we were seated) and got seated before us. the whole time we were dining, we saw no interaction between the businessmen and any sort of "boss" in the establishment. and the whole time they were loud and obnoxious. i'd rather have sat next to a crying baby.  onto the food! they were out of what my girlfriend wanted, the mexican egg dish, which the waitress should have notified us about before we spent 10 minutes deliberating on what we were going to order. so we went with the wolfpack dish and the eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, and sourdough bread dish, as well as a side of corned hash, and 2 iced coffees.  the way they serve their iced coffee is unlike any i've ever had, and i wasn't THRILLED by it, but it wasn't the worst. a bit of mint and hint of caramel and really creamy. our entrees arrived on the smallest plates they had in the entire place, which made it a bitch to eat and i got food all over the table like a sloppy 3 year old. annoying. the corned beef hash was phenomenal, the best part of the whole meal. i can never find a place that cooks my scrambled eggs how i like them, and although these were a *little* on the overcooked side, at least they weren't undercooked and spongy like many places serve them. the bread was good, the hashbrowns good, and my girlfriend's wolf pack dish was ok as well. the bacon...yeah, it's smoked, and it tasted like it had been smoked with a coop of hens. very gamey, not my style whatsoever. and it wasn't extra crispy like i ordered it.  the place is very small and it gets quite loud in there. i would NOT recommend this place if you're hungover. i don't think i'll be back due to the crammed-ness of the place, the strange menu (which i could only find like 3 things i actually wanted to eat here, they have some weird options), and the a-ok service.

I've never had a worse experience at a restaurant than i had here..even mcdonalds would have been better. we came here as a last resort because the breakfast club was overcrowded, and ive heard they have great mimosa's and bloody marys which was exactly what we were looking for. i tend not to dine in scottsdale at these kind of places because of the overtanned, over-steroided, bejeweled-wearing, snotty environment.   first off, there was a long wait - we were offered a free round of drinks on the house because of this...the bartender was new, so when we ordered she neglected to tell us about the different kinds of mimosas and bloody marys they offer...and they are only $2 until 3pm which was a pretty slick deal. try the fallen angel bloody mary, it's made with chipoltle and jalepeno. delicious.  while we were waiting, a group of the typical scottsdale bitches and bros walked in and just decided to seat themselves like they owned the fuckin place, while we kindly sat and waited. and don't even get me started on how many dirty looks my girlfriend and i got while we were waiting...ugh.  we finally got seated after 30 mins of waiting, and our waitress was very friendly and apologetic about the whole situation. we ordered the breakfast sandwhich and steak and eggs. the food didn''t come out for 45 minutes. forty five fucking minutes! the table of bitches and bros even got served way before us. and the food was COLD, and my bacon was not how i ordered it. my girlfriend had them re-make her dish, which took like 15 minutes and they STILL left off my bacon. we got offered free shots, and had several people come up to us and offer their condolences. what the fuck ever, there is no excuse for shitty service like we received.   they ended up comping our food, but we still had to pay for drinks and dessert (the cookie with peanut butter was alright). the main bartender told us he was going to get us another drink on the house, and never came back with it. the manager/owner also claimed he would be back with a card for us, and never came back with that.  it was also SO FUCKING LOUD in there (there was a football game) and they had the volume turned up so high i couldnt even hear my girlfriend speak and she was sitting right next to me.   i was looking for a cure for my hangover with steak, eggs, and a bloody mary and this place just made it that much worse and ruined my first day of the new year.  HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

the restaurant is HUGE. like enormous. maybe it looked so large because it was so empty, but im not one for huge crowds or elbowing neighbors during dinner.  went here for lunch while waiting for our movie. sat at the sushi bar, where you get an awesome view of...slabs of raw fish. not cool. it would be more beneficial for a sushi bar to allow people to view the making of the sushi vs. looking at fish meat.   after looking at the menu we were completely in awe of how many different types of sushi they offer. they have a special section of the menu with pictures and descriptions of the latest menu additions which is helpful. they serve you complimentary edamame (cold) while you wait and decide. their cocktails looked spiffy, i was a bit disappointed that their calpico was non-alcoholic, but settled on a fav of mine, four peaks kiltlifter. we also ordered a cucumber mojito which was clean, crisp, and refreshing. it was served with large slices of cucumber inside it which were delicious to eat soaked in mojito.  we decided on the volcano roll (baked spicy tuna), lotus on fire roll (a specialty, baked lobster meat and jalepeno on top of a california roll), and a classic philly roll. all three were fantastic. the lotus roll was by far my favorite though, a very interesting piece of sushi i must say (check out the pic). the sauce it was served with was tasty and the jalepeno on top kicked that little sucker up a notch. anything hot and spicy im drawn to and i'd come back to kabuki just for this roll. the volcano rolls were delicious as well, i've never had baked spicy tuna, or really any kind of "hot" sushi. all were reasonably priced and although it wasn't happy hour, we didn't manage to spend more than $35 for 3 rolls and 2 drinks.   not bad for a chain japanese restaurant.

i needed a hip place to put together a study group at and everyone in that study group to think i was hella cool as a result. close to campus and totally a gem for those that don't know or haven't been. nice study area towards the back with the garage door open to allow for natural, eco-friendly air circulation.  the line gets backed up pretty bad because they only have like one or two people working there. and everyone in there knows those people, so they get to chatting instead of pouring my americano. and questioning my capability to handle a large (4 shot) americano. i'm a fucking college student, you could probably cut my coffee with cocaine and i wouldn't notice the difference.    a large americano was $3 and tasted like pure espresso bean bliss. i put cream in it, but really, it didn't need anything. it was perfect in all of its cartel special bean ways. my friend got a soy vanilla latte which i tried and it was perfectly balanced. usually there is either too much soy, or too much vanilla, but the cartel coffee crew knows how to correctly mix and pour coffee and additives.    while service may not be there strong point, cartel keeps the doors open by serving the best espresso in town with the most urban vibe inside.

before i knew of mama mia, i ordered dominos delivery. the day i had my very first mama mia pizza delivered to my house, i nearly creamed my chonies. never, ever, will i order another dominos, pizza hut, or little ceasars pizza ever again.  the pizzas are HUGE, the sauce isn't overwhelming, the cheese is perfectly melted, and the crusty is crispy and thin. love the size of the slices - large and in charge. my favorite pizza to get delivered. i picked up inside once and they were extremely friendly to me and had my pizza piping hot and ready. they even gave me 5 bucks off since they fucked up a previous order. rad.  delivery might take you a while, usually it runs about 40-50 minutes, so order early. its worth it.

let me start off by saying this place is extremely difficult to find/see on the side of the road. better signage would be lovely...or if someone trimmed those fucking trees in the front of the place so you could actually see it.  feeling rather down in the dumps with a cold today, i thought nothing would be better than a hearty cup of soup. after nearly missing it, i parked illegally at the contractor store and walked inside to a quaint little shop. the owner (janet) greeted me and suggested i try the chicken with orzo pasta. i got whole grain bread and a black iced tea.  the chicken orzo soup was probably the best version of chicken noodle soup i've ever had. the vegetables nearly melted in my mouth, and the chicken was shredded (just how i like it) and tender. the orzo noodles were the perfect pick for this delicious soup and added a nice twist to traditional chicken noodle. the bread was fresh, soft, and delicious and came neatly packaged in a bag with a side of butter and utensils wrapped in a napkin. very nice to-go presentation. the iced tea was fresh, cold, and delicious.  my only complaint...$2.50 for a 16oz iced tea? that's insanity.

kelly from landis cyclery is the shidoobie shizznit. first off, it's awesome that a chick can work so well with bikes.  she really knows her cycles.  she special ordered me a beautiful globe bike, the roll 1, and put it together for the urban assault i'm about to unleash in phoenix. she also hooked me up with a kryptonite mini lock, the best of its kind, and a couple of simple yet stylish bike lights.  thanks to her i'm rolling around on one of the coolest bikes in town. it's a handsome fella.   if you ever need your bike fixed or repaired, or looking into getting a new bike, or any bike parts, check out kelly at landis cyclery.

oh new years, your hangovers are a bitch.  looking to remedy the situation, a new years brunch seemed the likely choice. after a drive by matts revealed a hell of a wait (even at 1pm, my gawd) we ended up at maizie's by chance driving down central.  the place is super cute. we opted for outside, because well, i wanted to take advantage of being able to sit outside on january 1st, 2010 and enjoy a meal in honor of my friend in kansas city being frozen solid. brunch menu included some tasty options at 9 bucks each, and i opted for the hangover breakfast pasta. now at first glance, it might not seem like these would all go together: linguine, mushrooms, jalepenos, italian sausage, chipotle corn bread, tomatos, olive oil, topped with two over easy eggs. interesting...is it not? greasy, yes it was...very daring, but something as sloppy as this needs to be consumed to wipe out any hangover that came my way. bloody mary? check.  my friend got the blue burger which was stuffed with blue cheese and bacon. the side of buffalo sauce was lacking any real kick which killed it. the sweet potato fries were fantastic. and my breakfast pasta was delicious in all of its strange form. eggs and pasta can go together, yes.  the service was spotty, i've definitely had better, and expect better from a place like this. it's a great brunch/breakfast spot, and i'll be back when matt's wait is just too unbearable for my pounding headache.

I've gotten better haircuts at great clips for $20.    the girl had no idea what she was doing, and took 3 1/2 hours to cut mine and my friend's hair. and our hair is short. i have a mohawk. could it be that fucking difficult? apparently it was, because i walked out of there with a very uneven, too-symmetrical, crap cut.    the stylist lacked confidence and only after 3 hours of turtle-like speed cutting, did the instructor step in and finally finish my friend's hair.   if you need a basic haircut, go here. this place is a glorified super cuts.

this is my favorite coffee to get in tempe...wish they would put one in central phoenix, but then i'd probably be hella broke.  i love the look and style of the place and the cups - that has to be my favorite part about this place..the employees and the atmosphere are always great...never had a bad coffee from this place...and it's a great price too, about a dollar less than starbucks and you get more and better coffee...i wish they had an indoor area, but i guess that's what makes dutch bros, well, dutch bros!  try the annihilator, or the almond joy. those are my two favorites..  ps- usually you can pick up ASU's wi-fi signal sitting outside...

after spilling nyquil all over my wallet earlier in the day, i was determined to pick up a new one at some point..after leavining buffalo exchange empty-handed, i thought about going to urban and forking out 15$ for one, but decided to check out this sunset clothing exchange instead..and there i found it, for $4.75...a perfect KREW black wallet - slim and sexy.  thank you, sunset.  although i had another mission - shoes.  how hard can i be to find a pair of all black vans or black creative recreation shoes?  very hard, cos neither buffalo nor sunset had any...keep looking i guess? i refuse to fork out the retail price.  sunset is very well organized, and much cooler-looking and less chaotic than many second-hand stores i've been to. they had a pretty good selection of shoes, which were all lightly (and i emphasize that) worn..lots of their clothes had tags still on them, and higher prices of around 20 a piece. there were some cool jackets, along with a one-of-a-kind vintage only shirt rack...lots of name brands, popular ones, lots of skate clothes especially..  highly recommended. and the counter girl was cool and super cute. :D!

i've been in here twice, hoping to pick up a new toy, treat, or accessory for my prized pooch, but i never seem to leave with anything. i find the collars and leashes to be nothing more than ordinary, and if they happen to have something glitzy, it's marked up beyond belief. as are most of their treats and toys. i can purchase most of what they sell here at ryans pet supply for half the price.   they do have a large selection of natural and organic and all that "non-processed" healthy food/snacks for your dog, but i tried giving kinsey some all natural dog treats and she threw them up two minutes later. so much for trying to be trendy and organic.   i'm assuming it's gay-owned because of the assortment of rainbow stickers on the door, so i'll give them cool points for that. but i just can't get over how overpriced everything is, and what little they actually have to offer.

yogis is to sushi/japanese as panda express is to chinese.  i have been in here twice. the first time the service was alright, and the food was lackluster. the rolls were small and looked nothing like the ones plastered all over the wall. they were served in a styrofoam box. the second time i went in the food was even worse. the girls in the back were chatting while i waited up front for about 2 minutes to order. she was extremely unpleasant. it took them about 5 minutes to make my simple teryaki bowl which was filled with little, thin, fatty strips of dark meat and topped with [yuck] green onions. the sauce was alright. not even siracha could help this bowl.  disgusting.

finally, a place for single people to shop! i was so sick of buying foods in large quantities that went bad before i could consume it...i love their prepared meals that they have which are healthy and nicely prepared. the fruit and veggies are usually pretty fresh and at good prices. their hummus is amazing! i always pick up a package (red pepper).   i love that they send me coupons in the mail every month for $5 or $6 off, which is like getting a meal for free. and the store is laid out nicely, and is always very neat and tidy.  buuuuuutttt, the best part......their bean, rice and cheese burrito. which i scarfed down drunkenly last night. PERFECT.

the best dinner in phoenix. 100 stars. absolutely perfect. really, nothing to bitch about here.  as the yelp 5 star rating says, "woohoo, as good as it gets!!" this place is definitely worthy of every yelpers attention. i will be recommending this place to everyone - most notably for their exquisite dining concept called "sunday simple supper" - where you can get a 3 course meal (plus amuse bouche in between) for $35 a person. really, you can't pass it up. and the menu changes every sunday.  i chose this place as my birthday dinner celebration for the lady and i. as soon as we walked in, we were greeted by the owner and shown to our seats. the place has an open kitchen and fairly large dining area, with dark decor and as it started getting darker inside, the mood lighting settled in. our waiter was up right away to introduce himself and the sunday simple supper, with bottled water and delicious sourdough bread served first. after running through the *gasp* 8 PAGES of wines, my lady settled on a half bottle pinot grigio (which they were out of, but we were offered a similar, more expensive one at the out-of-stock wine's price by the owner). i picked their specialty cocktail of the night, a jalepeno margarita, which was the best margarita i've ever had. first taste was a beet salad on a spoon- wonderful and clean.  first course was a marinated heirloom tomato salad with shallots and basil. beautiful presentation and just as delicious as it looked. in between was a gespacho with pumpkin seed. never had gespacho before but i'd eat this every day.  second course i picked the pork shop bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with squash and whipped potatoes, and the lady had the halibut with vegetable rogout and ricotta gnocchi. the pork was absolutely de-fucking-licious. melted in your mouth. i didn't want it to be gone. cooked and seasoned to perfection. the halibut was tender and flavorful as well. two superb entrees. we were served a giant bowl filled with blue raspberry cotton candy, aptly called the "marge simpson". melt in your mouth good cotton candy. the make your own ice cream sundaes were fun and the ice cream was churned to perfection. an EXTRAORDINARY and complete meal.  i ate everything from start to finish and left no piece of food, er, standing. the flavor combinations were unique and everything had a perfect texture. the service was consistently excellent throughout the meal. our waiter sent us home with a NOCA treat, some sort of special small cookie cut like a piece of pie which i ate a day later. absolutely the best meal i have ever had. NOCA blew me out of the water. wonderful concept, wonderful service, and exquisite food.   NOCA rocks yelpers socks.

this place has had a total 360 make over a la "divine design" since the willow house departed and hob nobs took root. it's still the same house, it just looks like a really chic, modern, bookstore meets downtown urban cafe. with tons of light shining in to warm you up as the weather starts cooling down.  i've been here on two occasions and ordered food on both, as well as an iced americano and regular iced tea.  the first time we grabbed a table inside and my friend and i split the vito's favorite in a wrap. it was $8 of pure italian deliciousness. packed with lettuce, tomatoes, salami, ham, and much more. it was huge, a half was more than enough. the side of cole slaw had pepper in it which gave it kind of a kick that i've never experienced in a cole slaw before. the second time i went i had the greek wrap which wasn't as good as vito's favorite but still packed a kick ass greek punch.    the coffee is good, i was chatting with the [assumed] owner and he mentioned he gets the beans roasted especially for him from the cave creek coffee company. it was brought out to my table with cream and sugar and was perfectly bitter with a hint of sweet earthiness.  the iced tea was average, it's not brewed cup by cup but they charge you like they do.   they close at 9 during the week which sucks, because i procrastinate til it gets dark and then trip out into study mode, and have a hard time finding a good place to grab a bite, cup of coffee, and focus. i find it to be a laid back place to get work done and bust out that 10-15 page research paper you put off until the day before it was due. FOCUS. get off yelp, and get to work!!!!!  *note: for those who live north of mcdowell, you have to go one block south of mcdowell and use that to get around to 3rd ave which is a one way street going north.  the parking lot on the southwest corner is open to hob nobs customers as well as the parking lot directly behind it.

stopped by this funky looking place around 6pm on a weeknight and no wait. ive wanted to stop here many times before but have avoided the twistingly long lines i see when i pass this place around lunch time.  the people inside were very friendly and although quite a bit stuffy and small inside, i could dig it. they have a large enough outdoor area with misters and fans and a pick up window to get your food at.  my friend and i each got the 3 tacos and a fruit slushie. i chose pear, and she chose raspberry guava. both were delicious and refreshing. the sign outside said "flavor of the day - strawberry margarita", and i was a little excited that they had margaritas but alas - no liquor license, so no cool, crisp, refreshing corona to wash down my tacos with either.  the tacos are good size each, with plenty of delicious choices of meats/fillers to choose from. we both picked red beef, chicken, bean and cheese, and carne asada. the red beef was my favorite, with the carne asada a close second. skip the chicken, it tasted rather bland. the cabage was delicious and crisp and nice substitute for lettuce. each of our orders came with 3 salsas and 3 limes, absolutely essential for taco eating.  i really enjoy two hippie's burgers and love their tacos. can't wait to go back.

By far my favorite book store in Phoenix.  Every time I go in there I never leave without a book or two.  Their selection is constantly changing, and all of the books are in good shape and come at a great price (most are under $10).  They also have a large selection of DVDs and other misc items.  The staff is always friendly and helped me out by special ordering the GRE Princeton Review 2011 book.    The inside is charming, and is literally covered floor to ceiling in books.  You're sure to find something in there to meet your interests.

this place is tucked away in the middle of a neighborhood and really surprises you. it doesn't look like much from the outside, but step inside and you're transported into a cozy little space with charming comfort food.  i didn't actually sit down, i ordered take out because i didn't feel like getting all dressed up and would rather enjoy my fried chicken and mac and cheese in the comfort of my own home. the servers were friendly and brought my order up right away, 3 boxes tied together with a string. sure, it looks awesome, but the second i hit a speed bump a box fell over and fried chicken fell all over my car seat. yes, i still ate them.  got home, dug in, and damn, that was the best, crispiest, and juciest fried chicken i've ever had. same goes for the mac and cheese, with bread crumbs, crispy prosciutto, and lobster. lobster in mac and cheese?!?! i know it sounds insane but it was actually quite unexpectedly good. the white cheddar waffles that came with the fried chicken were soggy by the time i got home, which soooooo sucked because really that's what i was looking forward to most, and i couldn't even eat them they were that soggy and gross. but that's my own damn fault for ordering waffles to go.  i'll be back to actually sit down and enjoy a meal here. very cozy. love it.

this place is amazing - everything I could want in a bar (minus a dance floor, but if I wanna shake my ass I'll head to Charlies @ 2am for after hours...) often i find myself limited to self-proclaimed "gay bars" in the phoenix area, which are nothing more than glorified dump/dive bars..but here i can go in with my friends and have a good time without scrutiny.  great selection of beers, I experiment and try a new one every time i go..fin du monde is a favorite of mine, as well as boddingtons...i'm becoming quite the beer connaisseur...i don't drink wine, so i really couldn't tell you much about the wine list but i've looked at it and it seems quite impressive.  the bartenders are great, knowledgeable and friendly...they had a live dj last night which made it uber cool, otherwise they just have a playlist going, always filled with fucking amazing music that i swore they stole from me..  the atmosphere is great, comfortable, intimate, cozy. take a date here to get comfortable with them...  def one of my favorite bars in phoenix.

I have to give this place another 5 stars for offering the greatest beer combination known to man:   sammy smith oatmeal stout + strongbow.    oh, and the first friday dj that gave me sour times. kudos, sidebar.

so after driving around south phoenix for an hour on a sunday, in search of an open mexican dive joint to get a breakfast burrito, and extremely hungover and tired, i somehow ended up at fili b's.  they serve breakfast all day, which is quite an amazing thing.  i think that if i hadn't had spent so long searching for a joint that was open and starvingly had to stop here before hunger completely overwhelmed me, i would have just gone to a more familiar mexican drive-thru, like the one at 5th ave and camelback, or 40th st and indian - all which serve some pretty dank breakfast burritos.  but i ended up here, and the food was meh. it didn't really hit the spot like i was hoping it would have. too much cheese and the bacon wasn't cooked long enough and was fatty. my friends got chorizo burritos which were bland and extremely greasy. i usually try to avoid fili's and go to one of the sister/knockoff joints like rollbertos, eribertos, armandos, etc.

i recently obtained an 80's nishiki road bike from my mom that had been collected dust in her garage since the 80's. a good tune up and some new tires were in order for my vintage gem of a road bike.  i took it to hoodride first, via recommendation from a friend, and was charged $45 for new tubes and a tune up. what i got were new tubes that encountered a splinter within weeks and required a completely new tube. a tune up that was promised was negligent as the bike didn't seem to ride right and didn't even look clean.  so after a careful yelp search i happened upon trailheads, and brought my bike in to have them check it out. they put my bike up and checked it out to see what i needed to get it back in rideable shape. turns out there was a ton of gunk in my gears and the tires were not trued and the spokes were loose. they offered to replace both my tires and tubes with thorn-resistant ones. i brought the bike in around noon that day, opted for their "silver" tune up package, which they bunked a few bucks off of due to my debacle with hoodride. my bike was ready by 5pm that day.  after i picked it up, i noticed my chain was still rubbing and making a strange noise. i had a friend who specializes in road bikes look at it, and adjusted my gear shifters that solved the problem. kind of disappointed they didn't catch this, but overall, i was very satisfied with the service i received. and they make a mean cappucino.

on a never-ending quest for a delicious hangover cure breakfast, scramble seemed like a legit place to check out. unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing special here. even by the looks of the pictures people posted - i've seen and eaten better breakfast food. hell i've made better breakfast food.   yes, the place is super cool inside. plasma tv's are everywhere and i made the mistake of sitting on the side where all the tv's were playing childrens shows. yet i saw no children in the entire place. anyways, i'm not so sure about the pay first and seat yourself restaurant concept, as i feel like i paid the same for the food minus the service. and i don't like having to get up twice in a meal to get more syrup, or tabasco, or a refill.   the food, like i said, was average. like, really average. we went with the meat omelet with an english muffin and hashrbowns, and the peanut butter chip pancakes with a side of bacon. a coffee and an iced tea. the iced tea was horrible and the fountain machine was out of ice. we axed that and picked up another coffee, bold. good coffee. the bacon was chewy and had no flavor to it, and it was two measly pieces for $3. the pancakes were dry and overcooked. the hashbrowns were approached in a strange way by the scramble chefs- they had bacon in them. they came out in a circular lump. the omelet lacked any flavor and the eggs were of a spongy, hard texture. it was all unappetizing, and it looked as bad as it tasted.  really unimpressed. this space has potential to be cool. maybe i came on an off day where the chefs were hungover too. two stars for the coffee and atmosphere.

This is my new favorite local foodie spot.  Came in for Sunday brunch with my girlfriend and we ordered two of their specials, the salmon/rice/egg scramble and the blueberry pancakes with homemade whip cream and honey syrup.  Also got their "orangeade" and moroccan mint tea.  the salmon/egg/rice scramble was FANTASTIC. came with a side of spinach with this delicious dressing that we both devoured.  it totally hit the spot and was just the right temperature (i have a problem with things either being too hot or too hold when they're served).  i wish this was a regular item on their menu because i'd be in here every day.  the blueberry pancakes were wheat i think, which made them not as moist as regular pancakes, but the blueberries inside of them provide the perfect amount of juiciness.  Honey syrup was different but what really made the pancakes was the whipped cream.  My girlfriend commented on how it was "just like her grandma made it".  Always a good sign :)  Like most of the other reviewers said, service can be slow, but I didn't mind, as I wasn't in a mood for things to move too fast.  Can get a little hot in there, as it seems they don't have A/C, just fans and a swamp cooler, and the art on the walls could use some help.  But I love the simplicity and design of the place, and considering I moved just down the street, this will definitely be a regular spot of mine to hit up.  Can't wait to try all of their menu items!

quite a little charming place, this moira sushi....  dead empty when we went in for happy hour the other night, but this place wasn't built to hold large amounts of people. MAYBE 50 at most. nice sushi bar area and tables to look out the window. happy hour menu is quite large and well priced. most sushi is 5 or 6 bucks for 6 rolls. a few drinks/japanese beers on special. most of the beers i'd never heard of so i asked our server, gordon, what he'd recommend as i'm a huge fan of newcastle. he suggested i try the brazilian black beer xingu. my girlfriend ordered some fruity vodka drink, which she really enjoyed. my beer arrived with a frosty glass and it was delicious. not as smooth as newcastle, more like a gordon biersch marzen, but better.   as for entrees, we went with the rock shrimp, spicy yellow tail, and volcano rolls. edamame and cucumber salad for starting. both apps were right on. not spectacular but good. the rock shrimp was crispy shrimp with some sort of sweet and sour sauce, it was pretty good but not a roll...the wasabi was so soft and fresh i could taste it before it even hit my tongue. the spicy yellowtail was delicious and fresh. my favorite though was the volcano, with crab meat and some sort of crispy outter shell and volcano sauce on top. good sushi, i'm excited to come back and try more rolls.  the music they were playing during our dinner was badass. very hip and trendy place and i could see it being an amazing date spot if they had more business. excellent service from gordon. i'll definitely be back.

this is the food cart that run's out of charlies, the gay bar in phoenix.  charlie's always seems like a reasonable place to go for afterhours on friday and saturday nights, but i don't go to dance. i got to eat the supreme drunken binge snack offered in phoenix: the super mega nacho.  they load a snack box full of round yellow corn tortilla chips with gooey good nacho cheese, fresh carne asada, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and top it with a dumptruck's worth of jalepeno's.  their street tacos are only a dollar each and are bite-sized bits of mexican goodness. their quesadillas huge and generously loaded with either carne asada or chicken. everything is prepared from start to finish right in front of you. it's cash only and they even have sodas and water for you. you can either order inside the bar or outside around the corner (which i suggest, it's quicker) so you can get your drunk food fix without being caught in a gay cowboy bar by anyone that might suspect you're not all that straight..

great service, great food, and great outdoor seating made for a wonderful first time experience at this charming little restaurant.  you would think that sitting outside eating in the middle of august summertime in phoenix would be practically unbearable. local breeze made it tolerable and i don't think my overly-sweaty ass ever felt uncomfortable once during the whole dining experience. they had fans, a swamp cooler, and misters going and it made for a comfortable and charming outdoor dining venture.  we started off with the greek lavosh which was to die for. the cheese they melted on top of it will make any cheese lover weak in the knees. their mojiot lemonade was crisp and refreshing. ok selection of beers, certainly not the greatest but i picked out a favorite, kiltlifter, to go with my coca-cola ham sandwich. my girlfirned (Rachel O.) went with the atomic burger as we are both fans of spicy food and this burger comes topped with horseradish. it even made her face scrunch up and me quiver in my seat the moment it hit my tongue and you better believe i enjoyed every second of it. the coca cola ham was HUGE and both of us only managed to eat half of it. leftovers are always good.  service was spot on, and i enjoyed the decor and atmosphere despite what many people have complained about before. get over it, it's no longer pallete, move on, and enjoy the local breeze.

so this place is rather odd inside, a mix between classy and casual, with eclectic artwork all over the walls for local artists...it feels somewhat mediterranian but then the 4 dog self-portraits hanging on the walls kind of throws me off. meh.  like ameerah said before me, lots of business/hospital people in here but i was in my work garb so i felt somewhat normal. luckily i had an hour lunch because even though the place was maybe a quarter full it took about 15 minutes to get my wrap. but it was damn good.  i went with the china wrap, terryaki chicken, water chestnuts, cabbage, and rice in a spinach ORGANIC (!!!!) tortilla and a side of chips. i almost went with a breakfast wrap (southwestern sounded delish) because they're awesome and served ALL DAY, but i'm a hardxcore chinese fan so i opted for the china one. on the menu it said it was served hot, and they weren't joking either. mine was steaming hot, and after waiting for 15 minutes i had no choice but to dive in and burn off half my taste buds. it was totally worth it. big wraps and very filling. i could only eat half.   the lady up front was very kind and took good care of me. i'll definitely be back to try out some more of their wraps, and maybe just order ahead next time. great healthy, sandwich option addition to the central phoenix area, but with the same downfall as many others - it closes early, at 3pm, and it's not open on sundays.

My friends and I decided to drop in here on a Friday night to grub and chug before we hit up the bars. We arrived at about 9:30 to a ZERO MINUTE WAIT (pft, Pane wants me to wait 3 hrs? I'd rather spend that time running back and forth between Pane and the Parlor feeding all of the hungry patrons waiting to get in Pane, the Parlor's delicious pizza and pitchers of draft beer).  The inside is large and in charge. Dimly lit and very earthy inside. Big comfortable booth looking out the window to a view of Camelback that was obstructed by a giant wall with the beginnings of vines growing on it. Who wants to look at 20th street and Camelback anyways? +1 star for ambiance and overall look.   Service was attentive most of the time, and although he forgot to get our straws and slipped up on one of our drinks, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He was cool and recommended we try one of the "mashed" drinks and we went with Strawberry, but was accidentally delivered a kiwi one. It was one of the best mixed drinks I've ever had. Very fruity yet still very alcoholic. We went with a pitcher (!!!!) of Kiltlifter for 14bucks.  Not bad, we got 4 beers out of it. All of their beers are on draft and can come in the pitcher size.  They even serve PBR! +1 star for awesome drinks.  We went with 2 personal 8in pizzas.  I think it is a great concept to allow patrons to design their own pizza with toppings and cheeses.  We got a pepperoni one with parm and a house sausage one with feta and basil and spinach.  Both came out in a reasonable time and were crispy as hell.  Delicious! Both pizzas were cleared within 10 minutes.  The house sausage was spectacular and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting the Parlor.  Very good pizza for the price, much cheaper than a Cibo or Pane pizza and of comparable quality, minus the wait and snobby staff. +2 stars for price and pizza.  I see myself visiting the Parlor many times in the future.  Great beer, food, and atmosphere.  Service could be a little more attentive and personal but it was acceptable.  Phoenix has some amazing pizza in it's valley and can totally play with the big pizza boys of Chicago and New York. the Parlor can definitely hang.

the first time i went through clean freak car wash, i felt like i was 5 years old again going through the car wash in the backseat of my moms Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.  i was so giddy and excited i could barely contain myself. the bright blue roof and name "clean freak" were very alluring, as was the $4.99 price tag.  pulled up and the guy checking in cars was super friendly and gave me my clean freak car wash card, where your 8th wash is free!!! and it's the super premium one too!! they have 3 levels to choose from. i'm a cheap ass and went with the $5 one. the other 2 come with 3-day guarantees in case it rains. HA. rain??? what is that???  went through the car wash and it was so badass i filmed a video and posted it on youtube. ha. ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldaciwSaWmg )  the vacuums are FREEEEEEE!!!!!! amazing. best car wash value.

i couldn't be happier that central phoenix finally has an uber delicious and super rad drive through coffee spot. and i'm glad it's by the name of dutch bros, a staple in the ASU area for years.  one of my very first yelp reviews was for the one in tempe, where i proclaimed that if they put one in central phoenix, i'd be broke. well, two months after it opened, i've probably dropped an entire days pay in coffee. and you know what, i don't care. dutch bros deserves it. i actually want to tip them and look forward to the friendly dudes that work inside that know my name and what i like (iced quad annihilator).   they're fast, friendly, and easy on the wallet. if you join the dutch bros text message club, you get notified of super sweet deals like $2 double stamp tuesdays. 10 cups gets you a free one with their stamp card. and a 16oz drink is $3.50 incl tax, about a dollar less than most other places. their sometimes overly-sweet combinations are a little high on the calorie and sugar count, and they offer to substitute their high fat chocolate milk in their drinks with chocolate syrup, but it's just not the same. i'll splurge for dutch bros though. all of their drinks are great, i've never had one i didn't like. they also sell just muffin tops, which is frickin awesome because i hate the bottom of the muffin...so, if you're in the area, drop by for one of the most unique and tastey treats your inner coffee junkie will go crazy over. you'll be back for more. and more...and more. til your stamp card is full and you're dutched out.

finally! my good looks get me somewhere! free coffee the other day courtesy of the foxy chick working the stand solo that morning. oh the hectic life of a working college student, and i need a quad dutch bros to get me through those dry mornings.  not to mention tons of coupons in the mail and a text subscription scores you great deals like $2 tuesday and every time a new dutch bros opens, the drinks are 2 bucks too.   i guess capitalism has its perks.

I followed Michelle King here from the disaster of Urban Hair, where the receptionist effed up my appointment twice and aggravated my nerves with her fake nice bullshit. The staff at R Salon are great and of course, Michelle is the shit.  If you have short hair and are looking for something edgy and fashion forward, get Michelle to do your 'do.  Seriously.  She's phenomenal.  She knows the industry and her styles/cuts/colors prove this.  She's flexible in her times and reasonable in her prices.  I am a prick when it comes to my hair, but Michelle turns it out every time.  Also...R Salon has those DELISH!!! sourdough pretzels and RED VINES candy at the front desk for the customers, as well as refreshments that I can't help but indulge in every time I'm there.

after being forcefully relocated to my parents house in the nopho/sco area, i needed a safe place to comfortably grab a bevy every now and again.  enter: rainbow cactus.  call me a tranny chaser, but i freaking love this bar, and the diverse crowd inside. it's divey and dumpy yes, but no different then most gay bars in phoenix. although my margarita i ordered lacked a rim job, there were plenty of people lingering around the pool table who would have given it to me instead.  and the best part? an actual RAINBOW CACTUS inside, which i plugged into the wall before i peaced out for crusin' 7th.

I really hope this place can take off and become a new staple in the Phoenix dance music scene. It has all the potential to become a chic yet urban yet alternative nightclub to mix with anyone and everyone who is down to get a little freaky.  The place is dark, dungeon-esque, Dom room call me mistress and spank me kind of swanky.   Sanctum is not the biggest space for a dance club to bust out, but they made good use of what little space they have.  The bathrooms are feauture an "open" concept, where you don't have a door leading to either the mens or the womens (although they each have their own "designated area" with the urinals behind a wall, i wouldn't really consider it truly unisex) but it's a place to er..meet people... Rawr. Don't forget to wash your hands. There's some sofa room to the side of the bar where you can get in a conversation and check out the crazy artwork on the walls.  The dance floor is not the biggest and I've never seen it packed, but I'm not one to turn down an empty dance floor with a giant chandelier hanging above it.  Crazy flashing lights everywhere too...The drunk dancers dream.  The stadium-like benching to sit on is rather odd to me, but good use of space, and I'm sure there will be plenty of patrons slipping and falling to their drunken demise. behind this seating though, is where it gets really hot. the private nooks back there might get you into a bit of trouble..  Drinks are poured generously, thursday's it's no cover and 2-4-1 ALL NIGHT, and if you get there before 10 any other night you get in free.  The one thing Sanctum is missing is an after hours party...I know I could keep going til 4am.

FINALLY!!!!!!!  i had a 30 minute break during work this morning and on my drive down 7th ave i noticed two hippies breakfast joint was officially in business. walked in and the place is HUGE, and unlike their other locations they have places to sit down and eat inside, plus little stools all along the outside.  their menu is HUGE and they serve breakfast all day, plus burgers and chicken sandwiches and such.  their breakfast bowls can be made as burritos which is what i did. you can choose up to 6 add-ins including chorizo, bacon, green chile, an assortment of cheeses, garlic, onions, peppers, the list goes on...and it comes with a side of potatoes.  i think they're lacking (besides chorizo and sausage) some kind of shredded meat (like machaca) or chicken for their breakfast burritos..and good hot sauce (the ones on the tables were blah).   great friendly service and one free refill on your coffee. place is cash only, and the ATM takes forever. this place is going to be very successful in the future...breakfast all day and bomb breakfast at that.

urban beans how I do love thee.  the espresso shots are pulled to perfection and i've never had a bad drink out of the 20 or so i've had so far here. the pastries and sweet treats are delicious. the toffee is to die for. the muffins make me melt. the tabouli and hummus are delish. the bagels are fresh. the goat cheese torte made me lick the plate clean. their smash drinks are amazing and i'm partial to the s'mores one. better than dutch bros sweet coffee treats. hands down.  the best part is that everything in here is locally made and environmentally friendly.  from the cups which are made from corn and totally compostable to the friendly, down to earth staff that makes the place a truly great coffee spot. so many other coffee joints in the area want to claim they are local and environmentally friendly and blah blah blah, but really, the most they can lay claim to is that their coffee comes from somewhere in AZ. virginia, the owner, really prides herself on obtaining everything in the places from locales. with all the coffee options out there, make urban beans your first choice.

way overcharged me for an air filter, pestering sales people, mislead me on pricing, dangerous cacti where the customers sit and wait that get their pricklies stuck in my hand and arm, bitchy woman at the check out counter, overall, a horrible experience.

let me be the first to say...this place is amazing, and sherry is as good as it gets.  the location is perfect, and on a gorgeous day such as today, i was more than happy to relax and enjoy the total hair experience that sherry provided me. the place has a huge garage door to let in the beautiful spring breeze and makes for a calming, urban atmosphere. it's not stuffy or noisey or claustrophobic like many salons are. and after you're done getting your new 'do, you can walk right next door to postino and indulge in a glass....or bottle...of wine.    sherry gave me a great short, texturific cut for an unbeatable price. she even rinsed my hair after i cut it so i didn't have to go home and take a shower to rinse away the little hairs left in from the texturizing. i couldn't be happier.

For me, the best part of being a Yelper is discovering new, fabulous, local businesses that I can indulge in and spread the love about. It's even better when I accidentally stumble upon a coffee gold mine, like I did Dolce Espresso.  I unwittingly locked myself and my dog out of my house this morning and lucky for me I had a phone and a wallet to remedy the situation.  We walked down to Camelback and headed west from 12th street and right before 10th street on our way to check out Noble Beast and wait for a friend with a key, I came across this little coffee shop tucked away between a Psychic and Anne's Flower and Gift Shop.  When I walked in, the owner, Cesar, greeted me politely and shared with me his special light, dark, and medium roast coffee blend that comes from beans all over the world.  Perfectly roasted and just-right bitterly delicious.  I ordered an egg, spinach, and provolone sandwich on a bagel which was tasty and filling.  The place itself is pretty nifty and ready to cater to the urban Phoenix crowd. Plenty of tables and chairs along with a couple sofas and three plasma TV's makes this place an optimal choice for someone looking to grab a quick bite, sit down and enjoy a cup of smooth coffee, or relax and take advantage of their free WiFi.  The best part of it all?  Cesar keeps the place open til midnight during the week, and it's 24 hours all weekend.  So instead of stumbling drunk into Denny's after a dance-off with a gay cowboy at Charlie's, head to Dolce and choose from any of their delicious sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) and a beverage to sober up and shoot the shit about the night's crazy shenanigans.    This is exactly what central Phoenix needs.  Here's to great awakenings for this charming little coffee shop that's willing to do what no other business in the area wants to - stay open past 10pm.  And it's "family" owned to, so I'm proud to blow this place up.

came here for "brunch" (whatever that means, technically, i don't know) on a saturday around 1 and we had the whole place to ourselves. it's not very big, about 6 tables and a bar, but it adds to the local homey feel of it. the waitress was very welcoming and got us some coffee to start. toast seems to specialize in breakfast sandwiches which are served on ciabatta bread from a local bakery.  i went with a sandwich that is reminiscent of a mozzarella caprese, except with bacon and a hard egg on it.  order up within about 10 minutes and gone in about 5. the coffee was delicious, i'm [assuming] it is the same coffee they serve next door at drip.  the sandwich was to die for. the ciabatta bread was delicious.  bacon was thick, smokey, and crisp. it was exactly what i was looking for that day. sometimes i need a lighter alternative to matt's big breakfast and toast definitely hit the spot. all of their sandwiches are made with fresh, organic ingredients and the flavors shine through. i will definitely be back to try more of their tasty sandwiches.

so after getting a facebook notice from cenpho about stingray opening up last night, i couldn't pass up the opportunity to check out a new local sushi spot and sample what they have to offer. the promotion was a $10 donation to a charity and in return you get to sample their sushi and their drinks.  my girl and i get there at 8, an hour after the gala started, and the place is packed. it's quite big inside, with the restaurant being divided half into a bar/lounge and half into a sit down restaurant. the bright obnoxious orange paint on the walls kind of threw me off but the rest of the restaurant was pretty sleek. they had a huge fish tank in the bar area....with NO FISH in it..ummm..it's your grand opening...are the fish swimming their way here? the bathroom, while trying to be cool and urban in concept, failed miserably with a sink that splashed water all over the floor just begging for someone to slip, fall and sue the company.  onto the food, and the drinks. while i was told my $10 donation would provide me with samplings of sushi, the only sample i  got was 1 piece of a roll that a waitress brought out. after that 1 waitress with sushi, the food magically disappeared. the roll itself was decent, i don't remember what it was, but it had a delicious sauce on top and a piece of halibut. the rice on the sushi was not as sticky as i prefer, it almost crumbled in my mouth. there were plenty of drinks samplings going around though, as if liquoring me up would make me forget that you're not passing out any food. we got a complimentary specialty cocktail, i went for the raspberry rose drink since they ran out of their kiwi drink and my lady went with the dragonfruit drink. i liked the raspberry one better, although they were both a little too on the sweet side for my taste. good news though, they carry newcastle.  bottom line - on your opening night, be prepared. seriously you guys. you promised me sushi and samplings of appetizers and you didn't deliver. after this debacle, chances are i won't even come back. there are a handful of other sushi places that managed to impress me way more than you did stingray. lame.

simple, fresh, and delicious. all important things to consider when picking out a place to grub at after an ass kicking workout at the y.  maybe not the healthiest option, but at least we don't have to tip out a waiter or spend 15 minutes deliberating on what we want.  i've tried the red chili beef, green chili pork, oregano lime chicken, tacos al fresco, and one of their breakfast burritos. nothing disappointed.  their tortillas, named best of phoenix new times, are so soft they nearly melt in your mouth.  the oregano lime chicken is my fave, because you literally get half of a chicken, on the bones and all.  makes me feel animalistic. rawr.  portions are generous, they come with a side of rice, beans, and two tortillas. their auga fresca changes daily, and if you catch them serving watermelon be sure to get it.  it's delicious and refreshing.  i don't know if they make their salsa in house, but it's fantastic.  the space is interesting with an open-ish kitchen and a lab where they hand craft their tortillas.  there is a tv awkwardly placed in the corner which doesn't seem practical for this place.  their hours are really odd, so i'd call ahead to make sure they're open if you're hungry like a wolf.

a creme brulee truck? only in my wildest dreams! sometime in between january and now i dropped out of reality every tuesday and enjoy a cup of the most delicious creme brulee in phoenix when i visit Urban Beans for a coffee.  the sea salt and caramel is to die for and pairs perfectly with a cup of drip coffee from the UB. every week they rotate the flavors - i've tried lavender, cappucino, peanut butter, vanilla, nutella, but the sea salt one is by far my favorite. must check out this guy and his traveling truck for a sweet snack when you can!

i'll admit it, i like urban outfitters. what i like even more is not having to drive to scottsdale or tempe to shop there.  the one at cityscape is new and nice, and they have a lot of products. they have an awesome selection of misc items that keeps me in the store for about an hour. lots of cool little odds and ends. you can find a sweet gift for anyone in here, and it doesn't even have to be clothing.   yes, they're a little expensive. but if you have the money to spend, it's worth it. lots of hip wear for your urban afficiando.    staff was friendly and helpful. one of the few shopping places that's already open at cityscape offering affordable post modern wear; i dig it.

every time i find a hairstylist i like, that knows how to cut and texturize short hair, they move away from me. i'm starting to feel diseased.  i went and saw aubriel nearly a year ago, random, spur of the moment type thing after i got out of class. she did a fantastic job. it was $60 which was the reason i never came back, because i really don't think it's fair to have to pay that much for such short hair you know? guys get my same haircut for significantly less, and it's only because they have a dick between their legs.   well, i needed another haircut really bad and aubriel was the only one i could think of and that i trusted to give me a nice cut. i got 20% off for booking a "last minute" appointment, so the haircut was only $44. reasonable. the aveda products are great, they all smell fantastic, and i got a nice cleaned up haircut, plus everyone inside was amazing and friendly. i love the look of the salon with the high ceilings and giant windows, it makes me feel like i'm in NYC getting a celebrity style cut. way to go mood swings!

This place is very cute, quaint, and homely. good place to take the mom out to eat or the inlaws. or your grandma. lots of old ladies. not exactly for a business meeting for the men, or anyone who is socially outcast, really.  i met one of my professors here for lunch and it was perfect..service was good, and i loved my mini bottle of korbel. ice cold water with lemon. she got a salad and i devored the tuna sandwich with potato salad. that potato salad was quite possibly the best potato salad i've ever had. big chunks of potato and not too overwhelming with the dressing. the tuna was fresh and not fishy, the veggies on it were crisp, and the bread was soft and mushy. mmmm.
