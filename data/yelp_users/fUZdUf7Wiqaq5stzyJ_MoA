Where has this place been my whole life???!! Books, old school games, music, albums, instruments and much more for a decent price. All are in well condition as they are used products. They test all games before you buy. I wish they had one in west Phoenix!

Every Time I get something from where they cook food, the place is always clean and fresh food is always out. There's a lady by the name of Silvia that is incredibly nice, & keeps the spot extremely clean.

Clean place, the guy that did my pedicure was very nice & made sure I liked my pedi; Very modern and comfortable place to get your nails done   Found this place through yelp, and all the 3+ star reviews are very accurate!

This is the nearest location before heading to work, and the line is usually long around 730-8am. Other then that, the staff is extremely friendly, and they once offered my drink for free because they felt they took a long time to provide service. Drinks are made perfect!

I use to like this McDonald's but they started to close their 2nd drive thru at around 12 which makes the line extra long (20-30min) wait time. They don't except cards at certain time due to rebooting the system; with no sign.

My work ordered this for our month end dinner, and it's amazing. The sandwiches are huge and worth the price. I got a turkey bacon on focaccia bread. Literally the best sandwich I've ever had.
