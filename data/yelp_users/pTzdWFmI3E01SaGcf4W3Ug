Teriyaki chicken was nothing special. Curry chicken just wasn't good.  California rolls were huge. Almost too big really.  Maybe it was an off day, but I just wasn't really impressed. Won't be coming back here again.  However, decor was really nice, and the service was top notch as well :D

Saigon Pho has some of the best Vietnamese food I have ever had.   Their lemon grass chicken is spicy, but oh so good. Their Thai iced tea is not watered down like other places.   The staff here is quick on the order, patient, and super friendly.

Great hotdogs. Pretty simple toppings, but this place is def. more classic than adventurous.  Hotdog, fries, onion rings, all are good. Don't be discouraged by the lines, as it moves quickly. Be ready for your order, as they will take orders as fast as they can.

I moved recently to the area, and in my USPS address change confirmation mailing, there was a coupon for a free oil change at CBS.   I called ahead and Jim let me know the wait, and it was accurate. They were quite busy, and the location property isn't the busiest, so it was interesting watching them play car swap.   Oil change was done quickly. Everyone there was really nice. Don't expect any fancy sitting area though since office is tiny. However, the work was done fast.   Jim made it a point to let me know that all estimates and checks are free, which is always a nice bonus.

30 minutes for a pizza and wings. I walked in and he said 15.   They were arguing in the back as well. Very unprofessional and very loud and does not make me interested in coming back.   I would not have ordered food from here if it took this long.    Would not recommend at all. Especially for pick up on store.

I was really craving pizza one day at work, so I decided to try this pizza hut one more time. I ordered by 10am,they said pizza would be there by 10:40, but pizza wasn't there until 11:30.   Avoid this place if possible.

I'll keep this short and sweet.   Best arts theater in the valley. If you are any sort of film biff, this theater will have what you want before it goes to the mainstream theater or to filmbar.   Prices are the same as any other Harkins. Food is the same. Seats are the same. All in all this is a run of the mill theater.   However, independent and foreign movies is their forte here. If you want to see this movies as soon as you can in the valley, then you have to head to camelview.   Unfortunately, it is set to close sometime over the next year.

Price 5/5 - crazy cheap food here, and the quality does not suffer. Spend 30$ for 2 full entries, 2 appetizers, 1 small bowl (think panda bowl), and 1 drink. That includes a 20% tip.  Service 4/5 - The workers here were running around. Food came out very very quick (like... do they have the meat precooked in the back or something?), and other than feeling a bit rushed to initially order, service was top notch.   Food 4/5 - Food was not bad, but wasn't the best I have had. For the price you are paying, the food is more than enough, and very tasty. However, if you have had real chinese food (China King comes to mind), you will be a bit disappointed.  If you are in the area, and want some cheap food later at night, then Asian Cafe express is your place.

Came here for lunch. Masaman curry had tomatoes in it, so I ordered it without tomato (cause who has ever heard of masaman curry with tomato).  Order medium spice. It tasted bland. Dish had a lot of chicken, but barely any vegetables. I would have liked a better balance.  Soup was okay, as was the spring roll that came with the lunch special.  Peanuts in the masaman were raw. I had ordered extra peanuts, as I have had Masaman curry at a lot of places, and I love the cooked peanuts. The raw peanuts were a raw deal.  If you have time, head over a few miles to Chanpen Thai Cuisine. MUCH better quality food.  If you work nearby and need a quick bite to eat, the prices were reasonable and service was good. But there are better Thai places close by.

When I go to a sushi restaurant, I look to make sure they follow the rules below:  1- Must have fresh wasabi. The paste you mix with soy sauce to your desired level of brown is great and all, but real, fresh wasabi is much much better. It has a biting taste, and not something you want to dollop on your rolls. It opens your sinuses right up, but in an awesome way. Best thing about Hana? It was free, and it kept coming!  2 - Limited American roll selection. If you like your Las Vegas rolls, good for you. I however like my raw fish, and my simple sashimi, sushi, and rolls. Hana has a very purposeful menu that sticks to the good stuff.  3 - Decor. Hana is tiny. Probably seats 40 on a good day. Very clean and modern feel inside though. No obtrusive posters or ads, all food (dinner and sushi) are made right there behind the bar.   Price was, Hana is a bit on the higher side, but you are paying for the quality and the service. Service was wonderful.  I ended up getting the Miso Soup to start (delicious), squid salad, Alaska roll, and an oyster shooter (best part of my meal).  This place is BYOB, so there is that. They also asked me about any allergies at the very beginning of the meal, which was kinda great (and would be even awesomer for someone who actually has any allergies),  Overall, is this a place you go weekly? No, not unless you are made of money. However, special occasions, dates, celebrations with a small group of friends? For sure!

From the outside, this place is very nondescript. Located at the corner of a strip mall, it doesn't look like much from the outside. However, looks are quite deceiving.  I consider myself a bit of a foodie. Every week, I try and go out to a new restaurant to try. However, for your Thai food craving, look no further than Palee's Crown.  Their lunch specials are amazing. I usually get their cashew chicken, and it is amazing. Watch out for their spice level, as they do not joke here at all. Their food is super flavorful, and just the right amount of meat to vegetable ratio.  Service is always top notch. I have no complaints about this place at all.

Great food. This place is cozy, and had water, flat bread, and 3 sauces ready to go at our table when we sat down.  Staff was just the right amount of attentive. Price was quite reasonable for the amount of food we got.  Favorite Indian place I have gone to in Phoenix.

Posh is an experience every foodie should have at least once! The location has underground parking, reserved for the restaurant, so that is nice. As you walk in, it is exactly like you expect. Clean, sleek and modern. Lights on a 50%. Surrounded by top to bottom windows all around. That kinda place.  I don't expect to be back here any time soon, so I came prepared with a notebook to take notes. Server informed me that the daily menu is updated online, so I could relax a bit! It saved me a lot of hassle. http://goo.gl/0RSOmJ  They give you a list of the ingredients they have for the service that night. You cross off what you don't like, let them know of any allergies, and let them know how you like your meat cooked (if at all). Then, they get to work.  Chef Josh was amazing. Normally the manager or the Chef goes around and makes a half hearted attempt to engage in a 2 minute conversation about the food. Not this Chef! He spent a good 10 minutes talking to me another birthday gentleman beside me about his start in food, where he gets his produce, his annoyance with the price of rhubarb, and how the menu changes up to 60% each night, meaning that if you come on Thursday and then again on Saturday they probably won't have the same dishes at all. It was one of the most authentic manger coming to check to make sure everything is okay conversations I have ever had.  They have 5, 6, 7 course options, or the Chef Omakase (all courses). The portions are small, so don't shy away from the 7 or Omakase just because you don't eat a lot. The idea here is to enjoy the journey and taste wonderful food, not to stuff your face.  They start you off with a small soup and salad to whet your appetite. I had the Mushroom Polentina | Fennel | Kale | Bell Peppers. They brought out the Bread Course | Fennel Dill Roll | Cardamom Orange Butter as well to start.  Onto the courses! I started off with the uni (Uni Panna Cotta | Ponzu Soy | Cucumber Foam | Wasabi Oil | Fresno Chili | Trout Roe). It was the best thing I think I have ever had in my life. It was balanced, sweet, salty, spicy, creamy, tart, and overall umami. It was a great way to start the night! 5++/5  Flounder was next (California Flounder | Braised Spring Garlic | Radish Sprouts | Garlic Brodo). The simple flounder really let the rest of the dish take charge. These two dishes were the highlight of my night. 5/5  Quickish review of the rest of my courses. Arctic Char | Shishito Peppers | Sesame Velouté | Herbs - The charring on the peppers really complimented the char (hahahah). 4/5  Sunflower & Fennel Seed Crusted Swordfish | Charred Fennel | Red Wine Reduction - Not my favorite. Tasty, but it had a lot to live up to. 3/5  Kaua'i Shrimp | Roasted Parsnips | Orange Segments | Orange Soy Broth | Watercress - Tasty. This was a dish that tasted much better together than the pieces tasted apart. 4/5 Tomato Braised Baby Octopus | Cauliflower Mousse | Fiddlehead Ferns | Concasse Tomato - Good, but not my taste. 3/5  Veal Sweetbreads | Braised Belgium Endive | Pear Chutney| Herb Velouté - The temperature balance on this dish was on point. The cold pear chutney along with the warm veal sweetbreads was fantastic. 4.5/5  Braised Veal Breast | Caraway Seed Yoghurt | Broccoli | Crispy Leeks | White Wine Reduction - This dish was not a winner for me. The veal breast was drowning in the wine reduction, and was a bit too fatty for my taste. The winner here was the Caraway Seed Yoghurt. I really wish I had more than just a small dollop. -  3/5 (Yoghurt 4.5/5)  Kangaroo | Brussel Sprouts | Salsify Purée | Cherry Demi-Glace - This was interesting. I have never had Kangaroo, and never even thought of having it before. It was a bit tougher meat, but tasted kinda wild (or as one of my servers said kinda irony). I really wanted to taste the meat on its own, but the puree and demi-glace made it difficult. Big fan of brussel sprouts, so they couldn't go wrong there. I wasn't sure how they all worked together . 3.5/5  Prime New York | Wasabi Potato Purée | King Oyster Mushroom | Red WIne Demi-Glace - The wasabi potato puree really brought this dish together for me. The steak itself was perfectly cooked, and the dish was balanced nicely. 4/5  Short Ribs | Carrot Spätzle | Parsley Purée | Pickled Red Onion | Tomato Demi-Glace - This was another loser. It was good, but tasted like something I could have at home. Short ribs with a tomato sauce. Cooked to perfection here, but just wasn't working for me. 3/5  Cheese plate: Époisses de Bourgogne  Raclette  Rogue Creamery "Smokey Blue"   By the time I was at this cheese plate I was hitting a wall, so they were nice enough to pack it up for me! The bread was delicious, and the cheese... well the cheese was cheese. I am not a cheese expert. 4/5  Stupid 5000 character limit! I will "update" this review as soon as yelp lets me.

Finishing my first review up...   My favorite part! Dessert. It was my birthday, so I had all 4 desserts (I don't recall if this was a birthday only thing or what they do for everything).  Flan | Walnuts | Berries | Cognac Caramel Sauce - Tasty, but a bit too sweet. Not enough balance here for me. 3/5   Chocolate Sacher-Torte | Chocolate Cake Ice Cream | Chocolate Decor | Port Soaked Cherries. Tasty, but the tort was a lot to take in after a 3 hour eating session. 3/5  Kiwi | Honeycomb | House-Made Ricotta | Bee Pollen - This was my favorite dessert. Just the right amount of sweetness to go along with the savoryness. 5/5  Root Beer Bundino | Ginger Pastry Cream | Ginger Beer - I had requested a palate cleanser after the kangaroo, and this was what they brought me. It did the job! 4/5  Strawberry | Oats | Rhubarb | Shortcake | Strawberry Ice Cream | Rhubarb Sauce - Again, another great balance here. Not too sweet, not too savory, just the right mix. 5/5  To end off the night I got a frozen lemon curd lollipop, which was quite interesting. I've never had anything like it, but it was a great way to end the meal 4.5/5  Onto my least favorite part of the meal... the bill. You obviously see the $$$$. You are going to be paying for this meal. I will tell you though, that even though it is going to cost you, and all the food might not be exactly the best thing in the world, overall, you will have an experience like never before.

These hot dogs were amazing. They are not your run of the mill hot dog stand though.  The toppings are not the norm, and there is no normal bread bun. However, you must give this place a shot. The food is delicious, and makes you want to go back for seconds.

First off, the guy didn't listen. I was locked out of my car at the post office, and gave very exact directions from where the driver was coming from. He called me twice before he got there.  He did get there pretty quick. However, when he got there, he went in the wrong way into the parking lot, and then parked right behind me, blocking traffic. There was a parking spot right next to me, but this guy and his big truck seemed to be above it all.  Process took all of 5 minutes. The guy was a complete asshole. Wouldn't make eye contact the whole time, and he barely spoke above a whisper. If you add in his accent, I was barely able to understand him. He sat in the drivers seat of his car and made me wait right outside while he did paperwork. Again, still blocking traffic, as cars barely had enough room to squeeze around him  I never was able to get a quote out of them over the phone. However, they were the third locksmith placed I called, and I was just happy to get someone who was able to come unlock my car.  Do not recommend. I am sure there are much nicer companies out there who don't have assholes working for them.

Not my favorite buffett.  Sushi was bland and not many choices.  Steak was overcooked (I told him medium rare and it was almost well done). Mongolian grill was good.  The rest of the choices are your normal selection. It was quite busy, which in a buffett is a very good thing (food gets changed out faster).  You do pay before you go even sit down, so be aware.  Also, there is potatoe salad right by the pudding. Be careful, as I almost screwed that up.

I was up on this side of the valley, so I thought I would find some food. This place came up as the highest rated restaurant that was open with 5 miles, so I thought why not?   Located in a strip mall, it wasn't much to see from the outside. Once you went in, it looked like your run of the mill restaurant. Clean, but nothing really interesting to see.   I came in a little before lunch, so it took them a minute to come out from the back. I had a minute to browse their menu. Pretty normal Mediterranean selection.   Started off with the soup. I had the choice of lentil or chicken and potato, and I made the mistake of going with the latter. Chicken was tasty, and not fatty, but the broth was just a simple chicken broth. 3/5  As for the entree, I got the 7, 2 meat combo. Portion size was good. Onions on one side and tomatoes on the other. Lots of rice which filled me right up.  As for the meat, the chicken was juicy and delicious. The ground beef had just enough spice and was also quite tasty.   Overall, if you live or work around here I would recommend coming here. Not worth the travel outside the area though.

Service was okay. Took them a minute to realize I was there.  I ordered the Caterpillar roll. It was a little different than usually, put a sold 7/10.   Service wasn't as good though. I was sitting up at the bar, yet it took a while for them to realize I was empty on water.   Location is great downtown. I expected more, but overall it was just meh. Would not recommend.

Sushi was good.  Service was slow.  Not bad if you have some time to waste before a movie, but not really worth it if you are traveling specifically to come here. There are better locations for sushi nearby.

Small little place. Easy to miss from the road (look for P. Croissant's on the NW side of the road. It is located just north of the corner store P. Croissant's).  When you walk in, you will notice how tidy, clean and quaint everything is. Not ideal for huge parties though, but not sure who would bring a huge party to get crepes. Once you get up to the front and figure out what you want to purchase (which is a feat on its own considering their selection), you will be greeted by wonderful service. I have been here half a dozen times, about half to get take out, and the other half for to stay, and every time service has really been top notch.  While I was waiting for my food, I got a little sample of their granola. After our dine in, we got a little cookie as a thank you dessert. It is small touches like this which really bring customers back.  Outside their sweet (my favorite) and savory crepes, I really enjoyed their selection of beverages. I've had their chai, and their coffee, and both were wonderful.   The only thing I advise is that you come here with a few friends. This way, you can try more than one crepe because believe me when I say you will not be satisfied with only having 1 from their wonderful selection.

Ever since Palee's Crown has closed, I have been trying to find a replacement. I finally found it!  This place is very easy to miss, but you will be sorry you did!   Food - Amazing. Some of the best Thai food I have ever had in the valley  Price - Very fair for the food you get  Atmosphere - This place isn't that great to look at, but you aren't here to enjoy the art.  You will wait a bit for the food. I have only ordered out, but you can wait 20-25 minutes for your food. It is worth it, BUT, don't expect a quick lunch if you work around here unless you call in early

I don't even know where to start. I thought I was an expert on shaved ice places, but man, was I ever wrong. Bahama Bucks has always been my favorite place, but this takes it to a new level.  First off, the ambience. You walk in and everything is crisp and clean. Definitely a modern feel, with a bit of comic book/gamer twist. You have art for sale on the walls next to posters of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.   You choice from 3 different sizes, 9 different flavors, 18 different toppings, and 5 different glazes on top. If you have any questions, make sure to ask the staff as they were quite helpful! I know other reviewers have commented on the service being shotty, but maybe they hired new people as everyone there was super nice and accommodating.   I didn't really know what to expect when I got my order. I made sure to get a little piece of everything in my first spoonful. Let me tell you, you have never tasted anything like it. The consistency was super smooth, and the flavors just jump out of the bowl. It was the best dessert I have ever had in my life. ever. bar none.  I did get a chance to try their Thai Iced Tea with Boba. It was really good. Nothing super special, but a good complement to the entry. They have a good choice of milk teas and smoothies as well.  Do not forget to bring your loyalty stamp card as you will be back!  I had gone to Cherry Blossom a few dozen times, and was always to full to try Snoh. Now, I will be sure to always save some room!

One of the worse experiences I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Ever.  I got stranded last night at the Dutch Bros at Camelback and Central. I called my insurance (State Farm) and set up a tow truck to come pick me up. The eta was 9:12. This was about 7:42pm, so I had 90 minutes to wait. Whatever, not a big deal.  9:12 comes and goes. No tow truck (no call either). I call them up, and the dispatcher says their driver is right around the corner. This was the beginning of all the lies and misinformation.  9:45 comes around.  No truck. I call back, and the dispatcher tells me she is going to call the driver and get to the bottom of things. She tells me she will call me back in a few minutes. She actually is a women of her word, and lets me know it should be another 20 minutes. No real explanation given, but she furiously apologized.  20 minutes come and go. Nothing. Then, I get a call from the tow truck driver himself. He asks me if I am by the houses or the park. Looking around the intersection, I asked him where he was. He was at South Mountain and Central, instead of Camelback. Even though I know my insurance had the right address, and the dispatcher also had the right address, somehow the driver still was mistaken.  Whatever though. I am a patient man. The driver tells me he is gonna book it and should be  there by 10:45. Can you guess what happens next?  10:45 comes and goes. At around 11, I call dispatch and she tells me he is at Thomas and 7th Street. Okay, that isn't too bad. This is the beginning of the end right?  15 minutes pass. Nothing. I call back and dispatch tells me the truck broke down, but he fixed the issue and should be there in another 30.... okay then.   Finally around 11:30 I get a call, and I hear this curse ridden driver very angrily explain to me that he is on his way and isn't anything more than 15 minutes out.  Right before midnight, I see this tow truck drive like a bat out of hell. He passes straight by the Dutch (even though I have talked to him more than once and told him exactly where car was stranded). He pulls into the wrong turn, and then squeals his way into Dutch after having to reverse himself out of a jam.  He gets out of his truck, and starts to swear up a storm. There might have been an apology stuck in there, but who knows. He complains that he is working well after his shift is over, and that dispatch isn't even answering his calls. He has me text him the address of the shop I need him to drop the car off at, and finally loads up my car. I wish him a fond farewell, and finally make my way out of there.  3 hours late. Curse ridden. Rude. Unprofessional. Bold faced liars. I could have wrote this post out twice as long if I wanted to include every tiny thing...   If you had any choice in the matter, do not work with them. One of the worse experiences I have had with a company of any type in my existence.

Decor:  It is in a strip mall, and doesn't look like much on the outside. Inside is a bit better, but small. Nothing too fancy but also nothing too terrible.  Service:  Service was top notch. They were attentive enough when they needed to be, and left us alone when they needed to be.   Food:  Food was great for the price. Is this the best sushi you will ever have? No. Are their rolls creative and tasty? Yes. The burrito roll was amazing!  All in all, if you are on this sound of town and are looking for good sushi that is not gonna cost you and arm and a leg, then head over here.

Everyone is complaining about emission testing, and not reviewing the place.   I checked online. They said the wait time was 6 minutes. I waited 5. I got in and out quickly. The gentleman running the tests were kind and explained any questions I had.   I don't like testing every two years either, but those are the rules.   The signs aren't confusing. Just slow down, read, and move on with your life.

I've been around the valley, and this is my favorite place to get my hair cut. Why? Consistency.  I've had 4 or 5 different employees here cut my hair. All were super friendly, and all did the job wonderfully. I have never had a complaint.  They do have coupons that can bring your price down a bit, but for someone who needs to get their hair cut every 3 weeks, I needed a place where I could expect the same level of service each and every time.

Location: Same parking lot as Sprouts and Angry Crab. Only a few stores down from the latter.   Aesthetics: Not nearly as cramped as a Barber, but not as posh as a salon. Very open layout, and also very modern and clean. Nothing dark and dingy about this place.   Price: if you get your haircut once a month or more, this place will more than pay for itself. With the limited haircuts plan starting as low as 23$ a month, a trip every three weeks will have you about even with most other places. I try and go once a week to keep things nice and clean. They do have plans that include shampoo or beard or both as well.   Employees: When you walk in there is an ipad for you to sign into. More often than not, I am already greeted by the end of the short process. I have had 3-4 different stylists, and all have done a great job. I haven't had a bad cut from any of them (although it would be nice if they kept a file on what haircut we get each time EDIT - they do keep a record now so that is nice).   Overall: If you live nearby, or even drive by the 51 at all, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Their monthly packages are worthwhile for anyone who wants to stay sharp and clean a few times a month.

I ordered a large cheese pizza and natural mini chicken spring roll.  Spring Rolls - 3/5 - Nothing special. Pizza - 2/5 -  Greasy. Tasted okay. I've def had worse, but this is far from great. Value - 2/5 - 25$ for the above and a drink. Not very worth it.  Overall, I am glad they delivered, but I won't be trying them again.

The decor is wonderful. Honestly, it makes up for the lackluster Italian Ice.  As you can see from all the photos, there is a lot to see. It is very cute, but not too crowded inside. Old timey phones are everywhere.  Free Ms. Pac Man was a plus.  However, at the end of the day I came here for Italian Ice. I got half cherry and half lemon. Lemon was by far tastier, but overall I would stick to Bahama Bucks. It was watered down, and not quite what I expected.

I saw Captain America here. First thing you notice is the chairs. Big bright Red chairs. Motorized so you can lay all the way back. Do not fall asleep though (or do.... It that is your jam.). They are the most comfortable chairs you will ever have the pleasure in seeing a movie in.   Location was super clean, staff was super nice, and I skipped over the theater food.  Price was just about the same as other theaters, but you get to sit in these awesome chairs.  They validate your parking but it seems like it was only for 1 hour.The Centerpoint parking garage is right around the corner. Better than nothing!  Overall, I was happy with my experience, and will be back here again.

When I first discovered chicken and waffles, I had a whole new world of cuisine open up to me. WC+D was not quite that eye opening however.  The building doesn't look like much from the outside, and even once you come inside it doesn't blow you away. The outside patio is quite nice (and I assume they will be working on the outside of the building a bit more considering they haven't been open for long and still have an ad for the old business on their doors).  However, you come here for the food. I ended up getting a dozen wings with korean chili. These wings are not tiny wings like you get at other places, so half a dozen was more than enough for me (but I get dinner for later). The taste was wonderful. It was the right amount of spice and a little sweetness. The green onions were a good addition. However, as most wings are, these are super messy. However, having to lick off the extra sauce at the end was a nice bonus.  I ended up getting a chipotle limon sugar donut. It was okay. It wasn't bad, but it was nothing special. I really wanted to replicate the chicken and waffle taste palette, but screwed up with the sauce wings and non plain donut.

So, this is a walk in and sit down Dutch. It is 100% what you think it would be.   The location still has a drive thru for those in a rush, but if you have time walk on in. The modern design on the inside is filled with stainless steel and their Dutch blue windmills. TV monitors everywhere showing off their menu and specials, or even ESPN. They have low tables, high tops, bar seating, and a seating area outside with a fire pit in the middle.   Service is 100% what you would expect from a Dutch. Everyone was super nice and personable, and defined the Dutch Creed, especially the last bit about being "too happy to permit the presence of trouble".   If you have ever been to the West Valley Thunderbird location, then you know the clientele. Lots of teenagers, so if you have a phobia stay away (and find a therapist because that is debilitating).
