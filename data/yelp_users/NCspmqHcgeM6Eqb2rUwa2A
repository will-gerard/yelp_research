Though it may seem like a hole in the wall. I started coming to Litos when Ritos (Glendale) was not being consistent with the hours they had of operation. My family and I often get Green Chil Burritos which are flavored with enough spices. The meat is cut in just the right size so you taste it but so some little kid won't choke on it. I often come in now after getting or waiting for a haircut from the barber next door.

Went through Drive-Thru, "ERIKA" claims they had no tortillas, so I ordered a 4 Breakfast Jacks instead. They came with no ham, but BACON instead, and NO RECEIPT WAS GIVEN.. WAS CHARGED over $7 ! Since when does a Breakfast Jack go over $1.50 ??? If I had wanted a Breakfast Jack with bacon I would have asked for that instead. Clearly very upset and will not return to this Jack In The Box location, ever again.

I love that I got a suite at a great rate. The breakfast was the best with a kitchen area with plenty of space and how it had a wide selection of choices to choose from. The breakfast was the best thing about this place!  The only downside was that it only had one elevator, along with stairs, if I was in a wheelchair or on crutches, and this place was on fire those individuals would be in definite trouble. They did lack handicap parking spaces, but it was better then most locations and hotels I've stayed at.

Dance floor is very small but the crowd is mature and very friendly as opposed to a dance club were young knuckleheads get bent over small little things. Live band was awesome and played a variety.

Boooyaahhh! I ate it, so I will rate it! I am such a regular here that the staff refers to me by first name or with a big excited smile knowing I am back! Actually no not really, but everyone is super polite and it is clean! Talking about polite, Marie and Theresa are the two individuals who I prefer to deal with, out of anybody, working here, but if they are not there, anyone will do, but those two ladies are super awesome!  So before, there once use to be several Whataburgers locations closer to where I lived. That is no longer the case and I am a sad panda.  I always order a #2 (Double meat Whataburger), add cheese, extra pickles, extra onions and extra mustard on the bun! I feel those three things help perfectly clash with each other so I can fully savor the meat and the overall meal. The staff never even judges me or gripes about me wanting all the extra stuff.   The fries, always crisp and golden and not too salty, but enough salt to have with the "Fancy Ketchup" ! I always grab extra "fancy ketchup" here to take home with me.  Onion rings taste sooooooooooooooo good. Add some ranch for 30 some cents, and yep..    Inside, like I said, clean.. but they play 50s-60s music, and it is music I grew up listening to, so I like the ambiance!   What I like is that I can go in at the 3am and sit down and my food is cooked just as fresh as if I ordered it at 2pm! This place is open 24 hours so this place is legendary in my book. Yes, I said it, LEGENDARY!  Here are the downsides.  You have to eat the food right there and then, right away. Not one closer to me. If you Whatasize the Fries, it's the same size as the large fries! Don't do it!

I started coming here when the Water & Ice location at 7980 N. 51st Ave., Glendale, AZ, 85301 was no longer being consistent with the hours they were open. I love to get some Thrifty Ice Cream along with filling up the 5 gallon water jugs with pure clean water.

A few rules to follow before stepping inside.  1. BRING CASH!   2. They don't have a public restroom, so if you are in line, and you  want to do the potty dance, you will have to come back in line, which leads me to #3  3. COME EARLY, EVERYTHING IS FRESHLY MADE, but the place is ALWAYS PACKED. Even if the line goes quick, so do the items.   I strongly believe in supporting my local economy and independent business. I always walk in a do the famous gesture done by THE ROCK as I whiff up all the sweet smells. This is one of those spots I purchase my Mexican baked pastries from. Everything is made fresh and daily. They also have tortillas being made fresh and in front of you on a daily basis. The place is super clean, everyone wears gloves and picks up your pastries with the tonsils, and the ladies all have nets on their heads. I often had a tendency to stop here before work in the morning and pick up a box of goodies to share with my co-workers. What I like the most I think is the server always asks if I want my bread in a box or in a bag.   There are many items to choose from? What do I recommend? All of it. If this is your first time here though, some must items are:  1. A concha (any flavor/color) - There soft breads, good to eat with coffee. I've never had a hard concha here.  2. A cochito: It is similar to a gingerbread cookie in shape of a little pig.  3. An empanada: This is similar to a turn over. I recommend an empanada de piña (pineapple)  4. A gallata de bandera: This is a cookie of three colors. They call it a galleta de bandera because the Mexican Flag has three colors, and well, these cookies do too.   5. A fluta: These are similar to Connolly but they have fruit instead of cream inside. Get one de manzana (apple) or piña.   I hear they have churros here though I have never tried them, it is on my to do list next time I come. Why don't you ask, and try some, then let me know? Right?..   Anyways, there is so much to choose from that I recommend you try something different every time you stop by.

One of the local mom and pop shops I like to eat at when I'm under $6, often getting the Polish Dog Combo, which is a Chicago style Polish Dog with Fries. Bring Cash because they don't take debit. I like bring a packet of Cream Cheese to add to my Polish Dog, and a packet of ketchup for my fries. Inside has a lot of interesting local sports memorabilia to look at if you are in to that sort of thing.

ROCKSTARS like me, who like eating some BIG FAT GREASY DELICIOUS STEAMING PEPPERONI Pizza, dripping with some hot melted mozzarella cheese and an ice cold drink should stop and have a meal here! Every Wednesday I come in, order 2 slices of cheese pizza, a side salad and a small drink for about 5.50 ! I often add pepperoni, but for a dollar less you can eliminate the side salad. Who eats something healthy like a salad anyways when you are about to eat something that will bring your mouth full of flavorgasms of delight?  Rockstars always do something to set them apart! One thing you can do is try Manzanita Sol (Apple Soda) on the fountain drink, I can't think of any other places that has that, so it separates this place apart from the rest, also,  I don't mind a small cup since I always get free refills, why should I pay for a bigger one? Right?  If you are eating with friends, since all ROCKSTARS have friends, get a large Roma Supreme for under $20 ! That's the true way to go!   The guy Colby who works here, super cool dude.  Major props to him always!  ROCKSTARS DON'T  buy from a pizza chain, keep those Arizona dollars in state and get a pizza here!

I am completely baffled by why anyone would stick a "I am addicted to Pete's Fish & Chips" bumper sticker on their car. Though all my friends swear by it, the one is in Glendale is not all that great compared to the others, and I have visited the others. This family owned money laundering operation has been operated since 1947. Why do I say that?   #1.) They only take cash  #2.) They have ATM machines outside 6 of their 8 locations. They don't take your card but they got a machine to take your card. How much $$ is the bank paying the business to have those machines on site.   #3.) Aside from money laundering by ONLY taking cash, how much of it is being reported to the IRS??  My friends also said they happen to give people who have just got out of jail/prison a chance, which I am all for that, but you have no idea what type of blackmailing those owners or managers can do to get those individuals paroles revoked.  Remember in Bound by Honor when Miklo was going straight and the owner of the tire company was cutting his wages from his check for the owner's gambling debts?   Hm.. not accusing anyone of anything, I just can see through it. Enough about that.   I am surprised how long a line of cars down Glendale are lined up to buy Petes, mainly during Lent.. the place is packed.. but the food.. not so good. Why people prefer to waste money here is beyond me.   The piece of fish tastes like paper card board. It is a piece of square that has been filleted and deep frieds. Good luck finding the shrimp among all the bread. The fries, blah soggy and sometimes cold. Never freshly made.  It all lacks flavors. No salt in anything!  I assume the reason behind that is so that you purchase more Pete's sauce which consists of water downed ketchup mixed with Tapatio sauce. I'm like duh, you don't think some of us would not figure that one out? I paid extra for tarter sauce that I never received, and I was already home before I noticed.  Makes me wonder if the extra change I paid for, for the tartar sauce, was pocketed and never rang up. hmmm Anyways.   It's not the same Pete's Fish and Chips I grew up on. Though it is close to where I live,  Petes Fish and Chips needs to start taking it to another level before I return.

A Definate must try! The nice lady always remembers what I order, the "Shrimp Lo Mein"  The Egg Flower/drop soup is always fresh as opposed to buffets. What I love the best is the prices. A Friend and I can get stuffed on $20 !

1st time here? Try a rice bowl, #50 is AMAZING. I also suggest you save room for desert, the shaved snow is FANTASTIC!

If you like great view of the Phoenix Metropolitan area, this is the hike for you. If you are a beginner or never done this hike before, bring water and hydrate yourself before doing so. Get here early on weekends before 7am,  If hiking in the evening bring a small flashlight.   It gets crowded and not many people are prepared for this hike, and on more than one occasion,  I have had to help people down or encourage them to get to the top.  The views of the valley are very beautiful, in various spots and I always make a friend or two when hiking here. I like bringing oranges and granola bars to eat at the summit and watch the sunrise.   If you see the guy wearing a weight vest and carrying huge punching bag, that's me, say hello!

There are several close stores to my home, but I decide to drive 20+ minutes just to deal with "ROB L." :) I followed him from another store closer to mine, but it seems "Rob Levine" goes out of his way to help and take care of my needs as a phone and data user. If there is a line of customers for Rob, I don't mind waiting either as opposed to using another sales person.

My Best choice to purchase comics in Arizona no doubt about! Awesome family atmosphere.  Ken Brown and his staff are knowledgeable and often going out of there way to assist me. I appreciate that they offer discounts to students and military individuals, along with bagging and boarding every comic purchased from the new releases or back issue bins. They have a great selection of posters and collectibles as well for sale. I like the fact that they often get involved with the community to have activities like "Free Comic Book Day" or collecting food for food banks or packages to send to military overseas. This place is a finalist for Eisner (Think The Grammys for Comics) Shop of The Year Award just about every year. This constantly place exceeds my expectations.

I am not in this area often, but when I am I always make it a point to stop here no matter how busy the lines are. Fresh fruit with shaved Ice, I add Ice Cream with Lechera. I often try different combinations so I can't give an option to try out but it is great and worth the wait in line. The only thing I did not like was the lack of seats on the inside, they should always have tables outside.

Every time I am in a big city or town I make it a thing to stop at local comic book store. I stumbled on this one by surprise though but I was familiar with the name being that I often pick up variants and that Maximum from time to time gets their own variants for theirs stores.  So I walk in, WOW. I was greeted right away. I start looking and notice how everything is organized. I volunteered at local comic book store in the city I am from and I know how much work goes in to that store, so imagining the effort that is put in to Maximum Comics Book store was a little mind boggling. The clutter was non-existent which allowed me to navigate the store for my personal needs very easily.  I loved how they comics were bag and boarded and in alphabetical order . Did I say how everything was organized? Oh yes I did. I have been to other stores and in those spots, I have to go to different areas back and forth for things, but Maximum Comics did not do that to me!  Oh yeah, the place is clean and there were nice comfy couches I could sit on while I caught a breath at how amazing this place looks. The staff, like I said, they greeted me of the bat as I walked in, but they also treated me like I had been coming there for years. Not many comic book stores have customer service like that one! I mean being I already feel like somewhat of an outcast for being older and liking comic books and some stores I've been too has staff that continues to treat people this way, but this staff treated me as I was part of some secret society they were also a part of as well.  I'll make sure if I'm ever here again to stop by.

I went on a weekend night, arrived at 6:30pm, party of 2, and was told my wait was going to be 40 minutes. At 10:00pm I still was not seated. Jasmine and Dante lost the list and were seating other parties who had arrived around 9pm. At 9:45pm Dante asked for my name and said I was not on the list and got stuck at the end. I was furious at this point. I had to at least ask for water since these two individuals are not even trained in service hospitality.  Spoke with Todd. I hope management trains individuals to offer water or soda to people waiting for such a long period of time. So BWW loses a couple of $$ on water/soda but it keeps people from leaving and return customers. Real upset at the incompetence of Dante and Jasmine for losing a list. Even more upset that I am a regular on slow nights and was treated like this, who could NOT seem to try and seat for a party of 2 in under 2 hours, let alone almost 4. Totally unacceptable.

I came looking to eat a hot dog and I saw that Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhiches were on the menu. I've been looking for a Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhich as good as the ones I ate in Philadelphia, so I gave it a whirl. Yep, so far best Philly Cheesesteak Sandwhich I've ate outside oh Philadelphia. I gave a piece to my father and he enjoyed the taste as well.  This spot knows what they are doing. The place is quiet, very clean.
