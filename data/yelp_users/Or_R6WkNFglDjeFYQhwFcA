Just ordered a Chicken Pesto Pita with a greek salad for lunch as takeout...  Not sure what secret code you have to input to have the salad come with dressing, but it did make the bag lighter to carry. Luckly they made up for it with an inedible pita featuring burnt chicken, disgusting pesto, and the saddest tomatoes I've seen outside of a Veggie Tales movie.   I'm not sure if they've just completely given up since Pita Jungle is opening just down the street, but this place used to be much better. As it stands now it can't seem to get much worse.

I love this place so much. Dr. Patti is awesome, but her staff is just as great. They've been able to get me in for emergencies, always put my pets at ease and follows up to see how they are doing. Seriously, I can't recommend her clinic enough.
