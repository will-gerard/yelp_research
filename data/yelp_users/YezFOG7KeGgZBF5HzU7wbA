We had a good experience there unlike the others.  Service was very attentive and the food came in a reasonable amount of time.  Husband had the WESTERN BACON CHEESEBURGER and said it was good.  I had the TUNA MELT and thought it was very good.  The fries were the frozen kind, so they got cold fast.  Some restaurants you just can't expect a whole lot.  I give them a 4 as the service was good, food was good and we were out of there on $21 with tip.

Booo!    When a restaurant is super busy, very popular and has large crowds, it can mean two things - it's an awesome place to eat or you're going to have bad service and cold food.  For us it was the latter.    We were taken to the patio (dog friendly) to be seated. I don't own a dog and I find it repulsive to be sitting next to someone else's dog while I eat!  My chair was right by a the door to the patio.  We asked to be seated inside.    Waitress took our order and it was about 20-30 minutes before we were finally served.  I ordered an OMELET MY WAY and did not get it my way!  All there was on the plate was an omelet, no fruit and no side of bacon.  The bacon was in the omelet which I did not request.  A different waitress took it back to the kitchen and returned the plate with a side of bacon and hash browns (which I didn't ask for). My fruit with whipped cream also arrived and was the best part of the meal.  The hash browns were cold and the bacon was cold and leathery.  My whole meal and experience was screwed up.    Then Mister Manager himself said something about our waitress having personal problems with her father because she never returned to follow up on our meal or provide the bill.  If it was me, I would let her go home to deal with it and get another waitress to take care of the patron, instead he just kind of stood off to the side.  I'm not sure what his purpose was.  The bill was screwed up because they charged for items I didn't ask for and didn't charge me for items I got.    I don't think I'll be eating here anytime soon.   The second star is for my husband's breakfast which was good and correct.

Very, very good Mexican food.  The flavors were awesome.  The beef Tacos are soooo good and the mole sauce for the Enchilada was outstanding.  Probably the best Mexican food we've ever eaten.  Chips and Salsa were excellent too.  However, the service was something to be desired.  The hostess forgot about us at the bar so we had to follow up on being seated and our waitress was a cool and aloof and didn't follow up with tending our table very well.  The men waiters were on top of their game as we watched them tending others.  We had to call on the Bus Boy a couple of times to refresh our water glasses.  Would definitely go back for the food and hope for a different waiter/waitress.

Great place to get your grove on!  BLUE MARTINI LOUNGE is a super organized venue that knows how to make it fun and is reasonably priced going out to a nice club!  We felt like we were in Vegas.  It's a very large venue with dim lighting, different levels, and strobe lights. Happy Hour is from 4pm-8pm everyday.  So all the drinks which run about $12-14 were half off.  We split a martini at the end of the evening after Happy Hour and found that one martini shaker (drink) filled both our glasses (just a tip).  No cover charge either!  We arrived about 7:15pm and got a great seat facing the lower level bar.  The band sets up on a stage behind the bar - but you can see them anywhere in "the house."  There isn't a dance floor per se but there was plenty of room to dance around the tables, and everyone kind of filled up that space.  I like that I can keep an eye on my purse while I'm dancing.    By 9-9:30pm this place was packed and the band THE PARTY CRASHERS knew how to get the crowd going.  Everyone was dancing and having a great time.  My only suggestion to the band is not take such a looooong break between sets.  My gosh, 30 minutes is too long!  The background music is just a constant beat, no music otherwise I think folks would just keep on dancing.  Blue Martini has lots of events which is a great incentive to bring in the locals.  For example, Western Night (Mondays), Ladies Night and Little Black Dress event coming up in the summer.    The dress code was definitely nightclub attire.  Great looking people there!  We loved our first time experience there and would definitely go back!

This review is just for the buffet and to let you know that it is really, really good!  I think it's the best I've ever been to.  Huge variety - Chinese, Mexican, Italian, great salad bar, breads, soups, several meats at the carving station, breakfast foods, beautiful cheese-fruit-cracker display, and in the center is all about the desserts - Wow! Everything from pies, cheesecake, cookies, cute little presentable puddings and really good ice cream (about 12 flavors) Delicious.  We did the Sunday brunch this past weekend and it included crab legs, shrimp, oysters on the half shell and a little bit of sushi.    The price for Sunday brunch ($27/each) also includes Mimosas and Bloody Mary's - remember it's all you can eat and drink.  The buffet is much cheaper outside of Sunday brunch.  There is something for everybody and the service is great too.  Can't go wrong here.  You will waddle out of there.

A must see!!  Looking for something different to do with your honey than the typical movie theatre or bar hopping?  Go see Romantasy Cabaret.  For only $18 each you will be entertained for 3 hours!  Miss Lucy the MC was a wonderful host and very entertaining.  The show is nonstop with variety skits, naughtiness and lots of beautiful women and burlesque dancing.  The skits were a hoot and the burlesque dancers were beautiful and easy on the eyes.  This show deserves a better venue than Club Red, however. It sits at the end of a small strip mall.  We had to line up outside until they open the doors at 7:30pm.  Show starts at 8:30pm.  Recommend getting in line by 8pm if you want a seat in General Admission.  They have cocktail rounds for the GA but not every table had chairs - weird.  I can't imagine standing for the entire 3 hour show.  Cocktails run about $8-9 each and are served in plastic cups except the martinis which were very good by the way.  They had a hot dog stand out front which we thought was kind of tacky.  That's the only food available.  My husband and I absolutely loved the show but felt the venue was cheap and tacky.  You can wear jeans but most of the women were dressed in dresses or club wear.  It's all about showing off your own body too and letting your hair down!  Enjoy!

Very Good Food!  Thanks to other Yelpers we took a chance and made a last minute reservation on Open Table for that evening.    It happened to be Arizona Restaurant Week so we opted for the set menu of $33 which provided several choices of starters.  I had the STRAWBERRY BABY GREENS SALAD - Delish!  My husband had the RISSOTO WITH ARTICHOKES and he loved it.  For our entree's I had the CHICKEN FLORENTINE and my husband had the PORK SCALLOPINI.  For dessert I chose the SALTED CARAMEL GELATO and my husband chose the CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE.    Wow!  Everything was cooked very well and to our surprise the waiter served a couple of cannoli's with a little candle to celebrate our 5th wedding anniversary which I noted in the Open Table reservation.    It's a white tablecloth restaurant with an excellent wine list.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant as the prices are reasonable too.

As you can see from all the reviews, yes, Allegiant Air service and quality is pretty bad overall.  Read the fine print folks. Yes, there are charges for Carry On baggage and check-in baggage.   They also charge you for beverages and there are no hot drinks on Allegiant Air.  At some airports there are no coffee places either, only a cold drink vending machine and a snack vending machine.    You can avoid a seat assignment charge if you bypass that step when booking your flight and let them assign the seat especially if you don't have small children with you.  Somehow my husband and I always get to sit together with unassigned seats.   Some of the airports are small with no accommodations and are usually out of the city limits or off the beaten path.  So, if you decide to fly Allegiant Air, here are my recommendations:  1.  Get to know the surrounding area of the airport you are departing from, what are the amenities, hotels, restaurants and taxi services to get there - you may need them.  2.  Bring lots of snacks - peanut butter/jelly sandwiches for the kids, fruit, protein bars.  You may be stuck in the airport for hours - sometimes into the night.  3.  Bring an empty water bottle through security so you can keep filling it up at the water fountain without having to pay $2.00 for a drink each time at the vending machine.    4.  Bring a book, Kindle cause you may be reading a lot to kill time.   5. Make sure you put your phone cord charger in your purse or carryon to keep your phone charged. You don't want to use all your battery power entertaining yourself with your phone and then run out of battery power when it comes time to check in with the phone (bar code) - oh well!  6. Bring ear plugs to drown out noise, crying kids and loud talkers.  Lastly, if you fly Allegiant Air make sure you are prepared to spend the entire day traveling.  Since they only have ONE Flight a day there are no other flights to catch if they are delayed or canceled which happens quite frequently with them you will be stuck at the tiny airport in a tiny town in a tiny waiting room for a very long time.  Safe travels!

We didn't like it, and here's why:  We parked in the covered garage at the East Economy Lot.   There was no signage pointing to the Phx Sky Train from inside the Parking Garage.   Found the sinage when up the SLOOOWWW esclator to the deck to catch the train. The train only takes you to Terminal 4. Lasted about 3 minutes. You then have to walk down a long corridor that takes you insideTerminal 4. Very little sinage at the end of this corridor - we asked a stewardess and she pointed us to the elevators. Get on the elevators down one level and out of the terminal to the curb to catch the Airport Shuttle Bus - make sure you are on the correct side - this is what I hate about the Phoenix Airport. Take the Airport Shuttle Bus to your Terminal 2 or 3.  This took us about 20-30 minutes.  Another group was just as lost as we were and just as frustrated.    Why in God's creation would I pay EXTRA DOLLARS ($11/day covered parking) to park at the Airport to go through all this when I could pay less at some off airport shuttle/parking company and be dropped off right at the curb for the airport Terminal that I'm flying out of.    Sorry Phoenix Sky Harbor - maybe after you spend another $240 million to extend this train to ALL terminals will it be worth my while.
