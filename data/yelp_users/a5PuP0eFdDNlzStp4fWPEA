Great food, reasonable prices, great service! You should go! Calling in your order on a busy day is definitely the right way to go as this place gets packed at lunchtime!

Had a great experience today with Tim and Jonathan. They were very helpful, personable, and great to work with. I moved to Arizona with my truck and my clothes and bought my first house here. I have purchased ALL my furniture here. Good quality, great prices, and friendly staff. I highly recommend Mor to anyone!

We were headed to The Vig and decided to try this place out instead. Amazing little restaurant in an old house. Great atmosphere, amazing food, and fairly reasonable prices. We had the Mele Salad and the Diavola Pizza... SUPERB!! Service was a little slow for not being busy, but we will definitely be back. Definitely worth a shot!!

If I could do negative stars I would. 3 strikes you're out. 3rd time I come here and the service is SLOW, unprofessional and the lot are out of ice and tea. The worst McDonald's I've EVER been too. Got to 24th & Baseline instead!!!

My order got screwed up and I was overcharged. The kid that took the order was very apologetic and tried to fix it but the manager was not very attentive considering it was not busy. After all the confusion/errors she didn't even offer to comp part of the meal I ordered. This manager could use a refresher course on customer service and friendliness.

Food was decent, service was HORRIBLE. As we finished our meal, I put my knee on the booth seat. I'm in flip flops and shorts. The owner came and told me to remove my dirty feet from HIS seat. My feet weren't on the seat. He proceeded to argue with me and told me this was his place and to remove my feet because it was unhealthy. I'm not a dirty person, and to be called out publicly that way was rude and unprofessional.   I will NOT be back.

This place is right around the corner from my house. Thought I'd give it a shot. Restaurant was not that busy and there were three wait staff. Wait staff was very friendly, BUT service was very poor. Prices were also over priced for the portion sizes. Not a terrible place, but I've definitely had better.

Highly disappointed in my first experience at an Oreganos. We had a large group with a reservation when they opened. Service was slow, entrees took more than 90 minutes to come. My entree contained two over done sausages that resembled cardboard and tasted just as bad. To their credit, they did remove it from my bill when I sent the dish back. Definitely will need some convincing to come back and try again.
