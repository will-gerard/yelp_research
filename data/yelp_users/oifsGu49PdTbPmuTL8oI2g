Super cute place! We sat at the bar and ate lunch on a Thursday. It was really busy but the waitress could've been friendlier! The chicken salad sandwich with potato chips w

The California breakfast burrito was a perfect combination of pico potato cheese and steak. Perfect for a hangover. I will not order the carne Asada taco salad again because it was extremely salty. I think it's because I got carne Asada though so I may try a taco bowl again but get steak or chicken instead. Then if all that fails I will just go for the breakfast burrito. I just love all the toppings on the tAco salad, it has just a little bit of everything in a fried taco bowl shell. I will be back here!

I've been coming to the Q since I was 5 years old. I practiced gymnastics in the gym behind the Q and went there after practice for dinner with my dad for years. It was convenient, delicious, and the bartenders all knew us by name and always had my dads drink ready. I decided to revisit last night, I am now 22 so I wanted to have my first ever, dirty Shirley. I was looking forward to sharing my history with our waitress. We arrived and took a seat in a booth. Our waitress approached the table and asked us what we wanted to drink. We wanted beer so she asked us for our IDs, and my dad told her he didn't have his on him. She snapped back and said well there's no way I'm serving you without an ID, when he was clearly the oldest one at the table. FYI, anyone that looks under 30 is who you're lawfully supposed to card. If you're going to deny service to someone that is clearly over 30 your tip is going to be crap. Strike one lady. Our food didn't take long but both the fried fish and fries were almost cold and hard as if they had been sitting out. Definitely not fresh out of the fryer. My number one pet peeve is hot food coming out cold. Especially fish!!!! We asked for hot fries because ours were stone cold and then she charged me for the extra basket!!! You don't charge people extra because your food when out cold !!! What kind of customer service is that??? Strike 2 lady!! My boyfriend asked for water and she brought him a Dr. Pepper, so of course he drank it, God forbid we ask for anything else. She notices during our visit his drink is empty, and asks him to refill it, so he kindly said well I asked for water and you brought me this... She blamed it on the table next to her and laughed at herself as if she was trying to redeem herself. Strike 3!! The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because I know I could have a better experience with a different waitress. It was all her fault my experience sucked. I'll make sure to stay clear of her when I go there. I've never met a server so bitter and rude before. Good attitude, attentiveness, and care get you great tips in the service industry. I would know because I am a server now !!! This chick was not happy getting $2 on a $60 tab. I didn't have to heart to completely stiff her but I hope she thinks twice and tries a little harder to please her guests. Maybe her tips will improve!

The meatball sub is very good. The peppers are super sweet and the bread is nice and fluffy! The wings are an interesting shade of red but are delicious and mild is perfect, can't wait to bite into my cannoli! We will be back!

If you're looking for a great bagel place, this is a great option! I came here to do homework. It's nice and quiet, they have amazing coffee! They have quite a variety of flavors including sugar-free options and also dairy free options. The bagels are all homemade and they have a great variety of them as well as cream cheeses. There is even baked goods such as muffins cookies and breads to choose from! What I love best about this is their lunch option, teriyaki chicken! What bagel place have you gone to that has teriyaki chicken for lunch? The owners put a cultural spin on their bagel shop and I added Chinese food for lunch. It's the best of both worlds! I praise on their uniqueness and talk about it to everyone!!! I will continue to go to this bagel place to support their local business over any Starbucks or corporate bagel shop! Most of the people that go in are in and out for lunch or a coffee but I had no problem sitting there at a table and doing my homework for a couple hours nor did the owners mind it at all. In fact it's kind of my new hangout spot on my days off! Thankyou Bagel Gourmet!

Starts off with homemade chips and salsa. Margaritas on the rocks or blended, absolutely amazing. Anything you order is made fresh with quality ingredients and authentic recipes. The ambiance is perfect, the music performer completes this family owned gold mine. This is a must. We moved to north Phoenix and STILL make the drive to come enjoy this place. This family deserves a lot. They work hard and put out an amazing product and experience. We are glad to support their business and tell EVERYONE about it. Get the steak fajitas!!!

I love this place because it is family owned and there is not an ounce of greasiness in any of their food. Everything is prepared to perfection and is super authentic. I try to spread the word about this place because they are never too busy when I go, but this is a good mine for Chinese! The Egg Foo Young is to die for, the orange beef is perfectly fried with sweetness, the combination rice and Lo Mein we can't go without getting, and the BBQ pork won ton appetizer, and lettuce wraps are all amazing!!! So fresh tasting like you're at someone's house. I can't get over how good this place is !!! Thanks to my boyfriends family for introducing me!

Jordan is the best bartender here !!! We always get our food so fresh and so crispy!!! The beer we like is 1664, it's sort of like a better bud light, same crispness but more flavor. I showed this place to my inlaws and we've come here every weekend since! Can't get away...

My first experience at this location was flawless!!! I got to sample the yogurts before choosing, I wasn't rushed or bothered by anyone while choosing toppings, the cashier was super friendly and very genuine to each customer, not just me and my other female friend.  Ofcourse I was reasonable with the samples but it's a huge plus to be able to try them before loading up. The yogurt isn't cheap so you want your flavor to be something you like. I like how there is a huge assortment of flavors. There is something for everyone and all are fat free! Way less guilt and it's so smooth and creamy. There is a lot of topping but be careful because you pay for the weight and big chocolates and fruit are heavy, it adds up fast. I stick to lighter toppings. The cashier tonight was really sweet and made sure everyone was happy. I will definitely be back!!

This place deserves way better ratings. The food is amazing!!!! Yeah it may take a while but have some patience going out people!!!!!! The kitchens in these places aren't the biggest and they are always packed so expect to wait! It's worth it. The Guacamole appetizer, mama Mia Mexican salad, & steak salad are the best!!! Gotta finish with a pizzookie !! :)

I've been coming here for nearly 10 years and have never had any issues until recently. My first bad experience was them charging nearly $5 more than what they told me they would run my card for. And the last 2 times I've made an appointment, they haven't had me written down when I showed up I didn't have an appointment. So I've had to wait even though I made appointments. I won't be back. It's unfortunate that I've been coming here this long and get treated this way.

I absolutely love this place and its concept. I hope they open one in north Phoenix soon!!! So worth the drive to Tempe tho. Healthy breakfast and lunch, can't go wrong with a reasonable healthy option!! Thankyou Dlish for blowing drive thru healthy food out of the water!!!!

This place is a shit show! They literally sell buckets of alcohol to all the belligerent night owls in this tiny tiny establishment that is outside. It is 2 levels but super small, and sometimes they host block parties that get super crazy. That's the only reason I go here is to see sick djs. Otherwise I would not come. There's no bathrooms, people are over served, but the drinks aren't that expensive and there's a cool patio upstairs. It's just really really dirty and the crowd is annoying!

This place gets way too packed, has a fight or 2 break out every night I'm there, some of the employees are extremely rude and feel they are entitled to shove their way through the guests, rudely take chairs out from under you when preparing for the midnight madness (could have asked nicely to take my chair from under my ass), and also, when a lady is at the bar, you take her order first, not help 6 males first even though you see her waiting. Not good customer service at this place. Least favorite bar in old town. Music is way too loud to the point where your ears ring after leaving and that is not necessary. That level of the music is not enjoyable. The worst part about this place is how many people they let in. You can't even walk around so pick your spot and make sure you don't have to pee because you can't even get to the bathroom. Glad to not attend anymore nights here, only reason I did was to celebrate my friends bday.

I love this venue. Inside and outside, huge bar and tons of stations so you don't end up waiting long at all! Bathrooms inside are a huge plus! Most raves don't have bathrooms. VIP area could be better inside of off to the side so much, you can't hear the music as well because VIP is to the side... Other than that no complaints, I loved the show I went to and will definitely be watching out for more shows at this venue!
