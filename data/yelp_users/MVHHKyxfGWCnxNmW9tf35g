This place is chaotic, confusing, and the people who work here are just plain mean.  Hands down, it is the worst airport I have ever been to.

My friends and I had a great experience dining at Grimaldi's!  The atmosphere is perfect for dining in Old Town Scottsdale, the prices were reasonable, service was good, the salads were tasty, and the pizza was superb.  We only ordered a cheese pizza, but it was far better than most pizzas I have had.  The pizza has just the right amount of flavorful sauce and fresh cheese on a thin, crispy crust.

I have been to an Old Spaghetti Warehouse in Texas and loved it, so when my family and I went to Chandler Fashion Center it was a pleasant surprise to find an Old Spaghetti Factory there.   The food was absolutely delicious.  While greatly enjoyed everything we ordered, my favorite was the garlic cheese bread.  I have ordered cheese bread from other restaurants and found it to be too dry/crunchy, with either too much or too little cheese.  At the Old Spaghetti Factory the garlic cheese bread was fresh, fluffy, and had just the right amount of cheese and garlic.  The mizithra spaghetti was fabulous, too!  In addition to delectable food, the service was great.  Our waitress was nice and attentive but not overbearing.
