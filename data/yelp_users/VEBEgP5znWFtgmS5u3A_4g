Food was ok, nothing special, but the service wasn't good at all. After the server brought out food, he disappeared in the back and didn't come out till we were done. Never asked how the food was, never refilled our drinks. And then he brought the check, which was a piece of paper with a price written on it, $41.75. No individual prices, no breakdown of food prices, tax, anything. I'm not even sure we were charged the write price. Will never be back here again.

Great place to vaccinate your pets. Much cheaper than most vets. Buts it first come, first served. The trick is getting the paperwork early and filling it out before you get there.

Went to PF Changs yesterday. Hadn't been there in a couple years. Went for happy hour and got the Pork Dumplings, Calamari, Chicken Flatbread, and Egg Rolls for appetizers. And had Moo Goo Gai Pan. Everything tasted awesome. Not sure why I hadn't eaten there in so long.

I'm amazed at how friendly everyone here at Liberty Market is. Everytime I come here, the staff are all so happy and friendly. The Liberty Potatoes are the BEST potatoes I've ever tasted. The quesadilla is amazing also.

Great little sandwich shop. I had the Turkey, Bacon, & Avocado sandwich. It had a chipotle mayo that was very good.

First time eating Venezuelian food, it was great. We had the Arepas Sampler, which came with 5 different Arepas, the Pabellon, Queen of Queen, Domino, Peluda, and The Blonde. Great service too.

Love coming here for a pedicure. Everyone is always nice. They always do a great job, and pricing is great.

I never know what to tell the barber when I get a haircut. When I came to EMG, I showed him some pictures of hairstyles that I liked. He was able to take those pictures and give me an awesome haircut. I've definitely found a new hairstylist/barber.

Great service. We needed a new dishwasher rack. Stopped by APEX to see if they had it. We didn't know the part number, we only had the model number of our dishwasher. John looked up our dishwasher model and found the part number for the rack. Unfortunately they didn't have the rack, but John gave us the part number for the rack and told us other places to maybe find it. Great customer service. Will definitely go back next time I need an appliance part.

Got a flyer in the mail for the new Peppermint Crunch Shake. It costs $4.29, which seemed kind of expensive, but I love milkshakes and peppermint, so I thought I'd give it a try. Worst shake ever. It was very small, and was so runny, it was basically flavored milk with broken pieces of peppermint candy at the bottom. Total waste of money.
