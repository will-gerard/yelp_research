All I really have to say is wow, the staff here really know what they're doing. In an age when customer service has started to die out they still do things the way it should be. Customer always comes first and the customer is always right. Not that I had an experience where they had to say I was right in something but I get the feeling that they are that kind of place. If you're ever in the area you should stop by.

This is my favorite Starbucks. I get coffee here almost every morning and at night. The baristas know exactly what I am drinking and for the most part already has the cups marked once they see me. I really like the new store manager Drew, it seems that the energy of the store has picked up a little bit when he became the store manager. Mario and Kenneth are always fun talk to at night on the evening shift. In the morning Katie is always bubbly and ready to have a conversation as she is making your drink or taking orders from other customers through the drive thru.  I have been going to this Starbucks for approximately 7 years and while some of the staff may change from time to time it seems that they have the right formula when it comes to hiring new staff. Everyone at this Starbucks deserves recognition for being outstanding employees.

I have ate here now three times. The first time I ate here my wife told me I had to try it. I have passed by several times never even taking a notice at it because of the area that it was in. However I can tell you after walking into the store it's like you're in a completely different area. The staff there are very friendly, the food is awesome, the serving size is bigger than most sushi places, you would never know just how good this place is if you only judge a book by its cover. This has now become one of my favorite sushi places.  You should give it a try if you're ever in the area, I know I too fail short of not judging a book by its cover. I am so happy that my wife told me about this place.

I have been here several times and the food is always awesome. The service is great as well however no much for talkers. Most of the time I go I order there Volcano Roll and let me just say that no one makes it as good as they do. I will be going back for more soon.

My Family and I have been using Dr. Sonny since 2006. I can only say good things about our treatment. On several occasions my wife needed an immediate appointment and they were able to fit her in same day. Normally with doctors immediate is not in there vocabulary but not with Dr. Sonny. He seems to generally care about the well being of his clients. I would recommend people to see Dr. Sonny if ever asked for a referral.

I have been using Plumbing Medic on and off for about 5 years. Every time I call or refer them they are on the problem right away. Everyone I refer to them always appreciates there kindness and eagerness to help in anyway they can. Every experience i have had directly with them has always been pleasant. So if you want quick, honest, upfront, and clean plumbers Plumbing Medic is the company for you.

Always a pleasure to do business with. Wayne and Travis have helped me out on a lot of purchases and are always willing to explain how things work in great detail. Their prices are always better than fair and when compared to other pawn shops they beat them hands down on price and customer service. I have bought just about every type of ammo from them and what is real shocking is that when no one else has ammo they normally do. I have also bought several tools from them and have never had a problem. I am sure if I ever did have a problem they would make it right any way they could. I have recommended them to everyone I know looking for a gun not only because they are the cheapest on used guns but also because they tend to have the hard to find guns. I will continue to recommend all my friends to them and anyone looking for great customer service and good pricing.

I have had 13 vehicles wrapped by Cortez. I would say by far there quality far exceeds all other wrap companies. I will say that they may not be the cheapest but they are definitely worth the extra money to have it done right. When I was shopping for wrap companies I did notice that most of the cheaper shops do real poor work and use less than good materials. I have referred them to everyone I know and have never heard one bad thing about them.

They save the day again. Larry is the best! Every time I call which has been probably 5 or 6 for personal and business they are always ready to respond. I have even called at 11 pm at night and Larry answered the phone ready to service my AC unit. Showed up and fixed the issue on the spot. With all the horror stories you hear about AC companies I am extremely grateful to have found Quality Systems...

The initial view on this company would have been pleasant, However we received three quotes before choosing what company to go with. Major League was not the cheapest but I decided to give them a chance if they could come down a little on their price. Originally quoted $4400 and I asked them if they could come down to $4200 out the door. They agreed and we even shook hands on it. Everything up to this point was going great. After they had my commercial vehicle for a week, I got a call from them saying it was going to cost an additional $1400 due to additional damage that they claim they could not initially see. It seems odd that after they have my vehicle completely torn apart that they suddenly decide they need to increase their price. Not like I had much of a choice so of course I agreed. I mean they offered to charge me to put everything back together again but the was not really an option. So if you enjoy bait and switch techniques give this company your business.

Well after you negotiate with someone and both parties come to an agreed out the door price, then you shake hands your preliminary estimate goes out the window. The difference between a shady business and a honest business is admitting when you made a mistake and accepting the consequence of the mistake. It is never based on whether or not you make a mistake because that happens. It is how you handle the mistake and in this case you handled it not very well. People should know that you change your prices when you think your not making enough. When your completed work order was given back surprisingly enough it was exactly the same as the other quotes we received. So either you are saying that you use bait and switch techniques or your saying that your estimators do not know how to properly estimate repairs on a vehicle. Either way you have not made good, honest and reliable business choices when it comes to my experience with your company.

This will be the second time that I've ever left a one star review on a company. I can tell you one thing for sure owning several of my own companies that if any of my employees treated any of my customers in the way that I was treated when I was at the store they would be fired immediately. If you ever do go here stay away from the guy with huge gauges in his ears. This person apparently does not understand the meaning of respect or customer service. One thing I did notice is that it would seem if you are not chummy chummy with the employees there you did not receive good customer service or any acknowledgment whatsoever.  From the time I walked into the store I already knew that it wasn't going to be pleasant. Stood around for about 5 minutes looking at stuff before anyone acknowledged my presence. However a few other people walked in right after I did and they were immediately helped. They obviously we're friends with the employees of this store. In observation a business is no place for friends to be hanging out with employees. It is a place to conduct business not a place to be chummy chummy with your buddies from high school.  I have been to several other vape shops and actually this one came as a recommendation because they would probably have something that I needed that the normal shop I go to did not. None of the other shops I've been to treat any of their customers like this shops employees. I would not even recommend people I do not like to the store. If you're looking for a good vape shop go anywhere besides here.

This place is Awesome. I get all my vape supplies from them. Currently using the new Smok Cloud Beast on a RX200X. Which seems to be the best combo so far. Their prices are as fair as it gets and everyone knows their stuff. They don't try to get you to but a bunch of needless stuff however I tend to buy everything anyways. I generally like to vape their mix called butter bean and also strawberry delight. I will continue to go here and recommend all my friends.

I have eaten at Stacy's several times and I can honestly say that it is one of my favorite BBQ places. It might be a little rough on the outside but once I get inside I feel like they always try to make me feel real comfortable. Staff has always been there when needed to refill drinks and to ask if anything else is needed. This place rocks. Gotta give it a shot if your in the neighborhood.
