Very friendly, quick service and was able to use a Yelp deal for a discount. Went in for an oil change!

Cool selection and friendly customer service. Even if you're not able to sell anything, it's fun to spend time browsing.

I don't ever take the time to write Yelp reviews but figured I would offer up my experience to save others the trouble of a trip. My girlfriend and I love trying out local restaurants, so when we saw this place we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the service was bad, and the experience as a whole was unpleasant.  We found ourselves dining in on a Saturday night, and surprisingly, we were the only people save for two bar flies watching television, oh, and the owner outside with one of the servers sitting on a couch drinking and lounging about. It was strange. We had two different servers throughout the night and neither were anything to celebrate; in fact, the guy who you could argue as our main server was slow and didn't seem all that interested in helping us, nor did he seem aware that we had ordered a dessert with the other server after we finished our main dish. I typically forgive this kind of stuff and don't even remember it but we were the ONLY people eating so I kind of found it irritating.  I'm seeing others describe the owner as a nice guy, and I'm sure he is, but I couldn't help but find his antics oft-putting, such as when he touched my girlfriend's face at one point, jokingly asking if her Sprite was wine. It would've been charming if it didn't come off as unnecessary and creepy. He remained outside almost our entire 45 minute dinner with a rotating cast of servers who would go in and out of the restaurant to enjoy whatever the hell it was that they were doing out there. I don't want to claim he was drunk because I don't know for sure, but it did appear as though there were some drinks flowing.    The food was okay. I would've given this place a higher rating if not for the weird atmosphere, strange antics of the owner and workers, and oh yeah, the bad music selection (I enjoy R&B but they played the absolute cheesiest R&B the ENTIRE time). The creme brûlée was messy and unappealing to look at. There are better pizzas around town, like Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Grand Ave Pizza Company, Pizza People Pub and Pizza Heaven. I wouldn't recommend eating here.
