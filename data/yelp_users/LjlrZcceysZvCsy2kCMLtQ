By far, the worst Greek food that I have ever had.  Granted my experiences are based mostly in Chicago (as well as Greece, NYC, etc.) but still!  I ordered spicy hummus as an appetizer.  It was neither spicy nor that great of hummus.  It was the second course that made me realize that I was in for a bad meal.  My greek salad was an iceberg lettuce with some feta cheese on top.  It did not taste like a greek salad to me.  My entree, shrimp with vegetable skewers tasted really bland.    I did enjoy sitting al fresco facing the fountain.  It was the best part of the experience.

I came here for brunch.  Since I hadn't had a good meal in Phoenix yet, I was a little worried.  I worried for nothing-- the food was really good.  My eggs benedict was very tasty.  I would definitely come back.  The only criticism was that the tea selection was a little poor.  I would expect something better than Bigelow.
