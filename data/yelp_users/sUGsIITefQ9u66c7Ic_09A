My coworkers and I had a goodbye work luncheon for a colleague.  The food was delicious and the servers were attentive and nice.  The management was able to coordinate with us to provide a special print-out menu and a microphone for speeches.  I would highly reccommend this restaurant for workplace gatherings.     We will be back.

I went to this restaurant with a group of seven other coworkers.  It was at lunchtime, so the place was a little busy.  However, we waited about 10 minutes to be helped.  We weren't offered chopsticks, which surprised some coworkers, when we saw others using them.    I ordered the vegetable soup and was presented with a bowl of clear liquid with three vegetables, including a piece of broccoli, a mushroom, and a piece of iceberg lettuce.  It was disgusting, I wouldn't recommend ordering it.   When the food arrived, it arrived about 3 minutes apart, so other coworkers got to watch me eat (hah).  Two of my coworkers found the "house special" inedible.  Another of two my coworkers thought the Szechwan  chicken was bland, when it was supposed to be spicy.  However, 3 out of 8 coworkers (including myself) thought the meal was good and would come back.  So that is a 37.5% for Szechwan Palace.

I love this bar.  The waitstaff is friendly and helpful.  There have been times when I have been personally thanked by the management.  This bar is frequented by servers from the surrounding restaurants after they get off work.  That tells me that this bar is good to their customers.  Servers and restaurant staff like to support their industry, when the atmosphere and food is good.  The food is one of the best aspects of this bar.  The hummus is to die for, and their happy hour specials rock.  I also like the "stimulus menu", which offers similar food as the full menu, but cheaper prices and smaller portions.  The outdoor patio area is also nice for socializing.  They have misters, which almost make it bearable in the summer.  There is smoking allowed on the patio, which is helpful if you smoke.

Two weeks ago I was searching for a place to cut hair, so I turned to Yelp.  I made an appointment with Corinne at E's Urban hair.  I described to her how I wanted my hair, which was shoulder length.  Because I have curly hair, I was concerned that my hair cut would be similar to negative past experiences.  Guess what?  This experience was also negative and the stylist butchered my hair.  My hair is now a bob, because curly hair shrinks when it dries.  It was only shoulder length when it was wet.   She also lectured me throughout the cut on how to hydrate my hair properly.    Also, the "layer's" she put in my hair were uneven on either side of my face.  So I had to come home and even it out myself.  I was obviously upset because she cut 8 inches off my hair instead of the requested 4 inches.   At least she didn't charge me for the haircut.  But no, I won't be going back there.  Ever.

This Irish Pub is one of the best in the Phoenix, AZ area.  The bar staff is friendly and the atmosphere is really good.  Along the bar they have patches from different law enforcement agencies.  Because of the downtown location, there are often meetings and conferences for law enforcement agencies.  They donate a patch to this bar.  I have seen patches from all over the country, including federal agencies.      The food is typical bar fare, with an Irish theme (go figure).  Some of the food is delicious, like the burger.  However, the Cobb salad leaves in a little to be to be desired.   Overall this is one of my favorite pubs in the Phoenix area.  I would recommend it to anyone.

The staff are friendly and helpful.  They seemed really concerned when my cat got sick.  The doctor personally called me when my cat was in the hospital overnight because of kidney stones.  They did follow up calls as well.  Plus the doctor was named Sean Penn, though I don't think it was actually the actor.   The hours are wonderful.  I would recommend this business to anyone.

Do NOT shop here.  A simple question ends with the sales clerk chasing you and your family into the parking lot screaming at you. This morning my parents, boyfriend and I were shopping local businesses in the Melrose district.  I thought some of the items were a little pricey.  I asked a salesperson, (who may have been the owner) if he would "take 10 dollars" for a plaque with a funny saying. He replied in a terse voice "we don't haggle here.  We are firm but fair" I said "it was just a question" the sales clerk replies "you got your whole paycheck last week didn't you?  We want our whole paycheck here too".   I then say to my parents that I didn't need to be talked to like that and we should we leave.  I said to the clerk "it was just a question."  The clerk than says "Capital F to you." I take this as him saying to "F*** you" to me, and say it back.  I leave the store and he then yells at my 63 year old mother (who walks with a cane) "your daughter needs to be educated". As she is leaving the store the clerk follows us out to the parking lot shouting at us that "Capital F means Figs and Home and Garden".  He also accosts my boyfriend by saying that "they didn't bargain there and how dare we presume that the place was a flea market." I have never been chased into a parking lot by a clerk screaming at my family and me.  This man (perhaps the owner) was rude and threatening.  I like to support local businesses, but this man's behavior was appalling.  DO NOT SHOP HERE.

I turned to yelp to find a dry cleaners.  They were friendly, with lots of awards on the window.  That being said, I wasn't aware of the prices.  They did not quote the items I brought in, they just took them.  I paid 62 dollars for 6 items, including 20 dollars to clean a dress.  I am sure they did a good job, but I felt robbed with these astronomical prices.  If you want to take your items here be prepared to pay more to clean the items than you did to purchase them.

I took my Bridesmaids dress here to be altered.  I ended up paying only $55 dollars whereas my sister paid over 100 at a Bridal shop.    They were friendly, helpful, and did an excellent job!  I would return to get other items altered.
