Great place.  Perfect service. Can't wait to go back.  Pasta salad was delish.

My wife and I had the honor of having Gwen be the officiant at our wedding.   She was amazing, and spoke words the were lifted from our hearts.  Afterwards many people commented on how beautiful the ceremony was, especially what Gwen said.  She made us feel comfortable and relaxed (as much as we could) for the ceremony. We highly recommend her!   Ps - have her there for your rehearsal.  It really helped us a lot!

Wooooo hooo.  I love dairy queen, and this is my fave location.  I go here for the drive thru since it's pretty quick.  Even better, they saw my little dachshund with me and gave her a puppy bowl of ice cream :)  She ate it all and is happy.  My cookie dough blizzard was great.

I've used camelback moving for my last 5 moves.  They're reliable, friendly, punctual, and courteous.  I refer them to everyone.

In my experience this is by far the worst Danny's out there.  The only reason it doesn't get one star is because they are close to the mall. I only take my car here if I'm desperate.  The one off raintree is better.  This one aggressively up sells you. To make matters worse they left streaks and water marks on my car...obvious ones....and it was a VIP hand wash.  They also left coffee stains in the center console which means they didn't clean that.  Drivers side mirror water spots.  Even forgot to remove the chalk they put on the window.  It was here 45 minutes.  Seriously take some pride on your work.  I always tip well but I'm done with this location.  If you want your car to look like it was actually washed take it somewhere else.

Amazing job!  I contacted them on Monday based on the Yelp Reviews.  I was blown away with how good of a job they did.  They were fast, brought their own supplies, considerate, and even took out our garbage.  I highly recommend them.

awful.  awful. awful. awful. awful. I'm so sick of ontrac.  Consistently late.   A package was supposed to be delivered by 8pm. It's now 9pm still nothing.  I finally complained to amazon and asked them to exclude ontrac as a carrier from now on.  Drivers are late, throw packages, make excuses, or just dont show up.

Slowest.  Starbucks.   Ever.  Seriously.  I've gotten more free coffee from this than a support group meeting.  I'd rather pay and get it on time.  I like the employees but maybe speed it up

Don is awesome. He's the reason I come to this Taco Bell. Wish it was open later.  But don makes it worth the drive.  Best Taco Bell ever.

Just left. I wanted to eat another pizza it was that good.  The Biagga was fantastic. Probably the best prosciutto style pizza I've ever had.  Owner and staff were very friendly.   I will be back again.

I started looking at homes on my own, thinking I could do it. Wow, was i wrong.  I had worked with Tucker in the past on some different projects and I knew I could trust him.  I can say that Tucker has been a tremendous influence in helping me with finding the perfect home for myself and my family.  He was punctual, attentive, and willing to go the extra mile to make sure I was comfortable with my decision.  I would recommend him highly to anyone looking to buy a home.

One of my favorite places.  I order take out and delivery quite a bit. I also love that the patio is dog friendly.    The meat balls are far and away the best thing.  The Arthur ash pasta and meatballs is even better. I had a peach smoothie that was really good as well.    Only thing is I wish they had a steak option or something. But overall it's awesome!

Seriously the best brisket I've ever had. I've been to all the places in Texas, Memphis, and North Carolina.   This beats them hands down.  I don't like lines so I only go late on Fridays. They're all out of fatty brisket by then. Don't care.  Lean is fine and amazing.

Went with a group last night and was surprised we were able to get in.  The service was very.....awkward.  It must have been our servers first serving job as well.  I chalked this up to being new so I'm not deducting anything.    Ordered the butchers board and appreciated the explanation about the different meats and cheeses. The "mine" bleu cheese was the best.  Ordered the prime strip and it was excellent.  Substituted the mashed potatoes and they were good but my friend said hers were cold.  She also just likes to complain.    Banana cream pie was good.  Had a kick to it.     Will be back again.

This place is awesome! Went this morning after seeing the reviews and it was great.   Our new fave spot hands down.
