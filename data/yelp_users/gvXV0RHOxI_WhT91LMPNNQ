When headed east to climb on the weekends, we usually default to the excellent Farmhouse in Gilbert for breakfast. Thanks to a new fangled Blackberry, I tracked down a different option on Yelp and we ended up at the Feedbag in the heart of AJ.   The Feedbag lived up to its affordable raves, but as a breakfast snob it hardly cuts the mustard. It was like going to a local version of Denny's. Huge, old and bland.  We waited 20 minutes for a table - Ok. It was Sunday morning. But then it was another 20 minutes to get our food after we ordered. It's only scrambled eggs and potatoes!  The waitress described the homefries with cheese special as more of a potatoes au gratin with layers of potatoes, cheese, peppers and onions. I was really keen on cheesy potatoes. What I got was homefries with like one ounce of cheese on top. They were OK, but really not the au gratin goodness I was hoping for.  We had hoped to carb up before a day of climbing, but the portions were small. I guess that's why they're so affordable. Next time, we'll stick with the Farm.

Sitting near a table of older patrons at Hoosiers this weekend, I listened to them decipher the HDTV conversion in the way only seniors can. Did they need to get cable? Was a converter box free? One was paying for hers. One had a box and cable...   Of course I chuckled, but understood what they weren't saying. Why does something as easy as TV have to be so complicated- or expensive? I say the same thing about breakfast.  I guess that's why we were all at Hoosiers. Good, solid.breakfasts. Fast, friendly service. And all for under $10.

Am I enough of a Yelper to tell you my guilty pleasures? I love Kitchen Nightmares - that reality show with the angry British chef. It's part business case study, part peek behind the scenes of restaurant glamour. I know its tough running a restaurant, but can the people on the show really not see what's wrong??!!  So why do I think of Kitchen Nightmares when I sit at the bar of Fusion on a Saturday night? Not because it's a candidate for the show, but because it's the complete and total opposite. Fusion owners Matt and JenLynn Long have the essentials of the restaurant business down: great food, great service.   Fusion is the most humble restaurant in downtown Scottsdale. Tucked behind the too-cool-for-school W Hotel and Axis/Radius, this is the kind of neighborhood restaurant you'd expect in downtown Phoenix.  Walk in and JenLynn will greet you like an old friend - even if it's your first time. She'll help you pick out the perfect martini - a pomegranate, orange vodka blend for me that night - and make sure your entr√©e is just to order. A curtain separates the bar from the main dining where families and couples enjoy their meals.   Sometimes Fusion can be a expensive - $30-40 for dinner. But it's worth it for a dinner you'll remember like a dream - not a nightmare.

I used to say AZ 88s martinis were served in a time warp. You would finish one, feel fan-freakin'-tastic and order another. By the time it arrived at your table, the effects of the first one had hit and you were wasted.  At Monkey Pants, I have to say "Let's do the time warp again." I ordered a small vodka tonic with the intent of having just one drink, doing a little writing, a taking in the Monkey Pants lifestyle. I felt fan-freakin'-tastic after one. Enough to say, "sure give me another." By the time it arrived.... Well, you know the story. Thankfully, I'd also ordered the grilled ham and cheese. Yummers, and very good with the VT.

Why am I cursing Italy this week? I've made it through stints as a journalist, a political wonk, a gen x-er, and a northwest grunge girl and I've never succumb to the temptations of coffee. But this last vacation has me hooked on macchiattos - that tiny little cross breed of a cappuccino and an espresso.   And while I'm at it I should also curse the Yelp Office Hours because that's how I heard about Bunna Coffee. I never would have seen this friendly space tucked behind the DQ on Rural and Elliott otherwise. And I never would have been tempted back by Bunna's exchange rate affordable macchiato ($1.35 is about the same as 1 euro these days.)   The free wifi ensures I will come back to Bunna for some work away from work time, just like that spot of milk and foam turned a random "act like the locals" experiment into my latest craving.

I first went to Cartel over the summer and was impressed more with the concept then the execution. The bar was just inside the entrance, the loungey area nothing more than a couple of sofas. Plus I don't drink coffee and they didn't have much else.  Went back for the Yelp Office Hours this month and am a new fan. They've moved the bar to the center of the space and the open space makes all the difference. Also have quirky art around the walls, some nice tables and the same sofas which now seem more inviting.  Add free wi-fi and hot chocolate to this list of praises and I've found a new "escaping from work, but still working" place.

N.D. - I feel your pain because I was there last night too.  When I imagined Spain I thought of the wonderful discovery of the tapas concept when I went to Barcelona. Those quick, but delicious bites of food washed down with beer, cava or sangria.... Instead, I now imagine Spain as the longest dinner of the worst tapas, saved only by the company of good friends.   We also had four people serving us - each so eager to tell us about how they were closing for a week for a wonderful remodel. New lighting, new colors, yada, yada, yada.  True, Imagine Spain doesn't exactly conger up trips abroad when you walk through the door. But a new coat of paint and cozy lighting ignores the bigger issues here. The owners should be imagining a new kitchen and wait staff and a new menu.  There are serious kitchen problems with this restaurant. They could have been overlooked with good service and good food, but this restaurant fails on all accounts.   - Our clearly inexperienced waitress started the night telling us about the remodel - and how they were out of some of the tapas because they weren't restocking their kitchen. Great - would anything be fresh that night?  - It was clear no one was running the kitchen when it took a very long 20+ minutes for our soups and salads to come out.   - No bread refills in that time or check ins to explain why. Just frantic servers standing by the kitchen window.  - When our food did arrive, that's when the co-owner decided to chat us up. Hey, did they hear about their fantastic remodel? Could they make anything better? Trust me I had plenty to say. But I really wanted to eat my salad and I still wanted to give the food a chance to save the day.  - The first tapa out was our fish croquet. My hungry vegetarian friends dived in - only to bite into a ham croquet.  - My friends and I have all traveled or lived in Spain. These tapas were OK, but hardly traditional.  - The final tapa out was the muscles. I love muscles and thought the this dish could save the whole evening. I grabbed one, popped it into my mouth and can't even describe the confusion I had when I realized it was still frozen!  - Our clueless waitress didn't even seem stunned by this. She just took them away and took them off the bill.   All I can say to the owners is: Imagine This:  - a neon sign to tell people where you are on a dark night. - a new kitchen staff - with someone in charge who can run a line and time dishes. - step up and talk to your guests. Acknowledge problems before you bring them their food. Bring out bread, olives, drinks to fill the gap if the kitchen is behind. - hire experienced servers. It's all nice and good that you're family run. But if your family can't handle more than two tables without stressing out you'll never get more than two tables.

I was toying with the idea of going on the wagon for a few weeks when I met my friend at The Mission, but the Sophia Loren cocktail caught my eye. My friend was intrigued by the Mexican Painkiller, and I couldn't let her drink alone. And oh, I'm so glad I'm such a good friend.   The Sophia instantly made my list as one of the best cocktails I have ever had - fresh strawberries and mint muddled in rum and another liqueur I can't remember. Just sweet enough to be refreshing. And plenty strong enough to make any hour happy. This drink defines the word elixir. It is as intoxicatingly unforgettable as its namesake.

It's the little things that count. I was craving a chocolate something and the starbucks failed me. Walked across the street for a splurge on a cake donut and a little childhood nostalgia and was sad to settle for donut holes - no choco donuts available. Still, the gal gave me five for the price of four, they satisfied the craving and the nostalgia. Can't beat that with a stick starbucks.

Even though  the Daily Dose (aka the Double D), just opened, I've been there twice already. This is a new breakfast-and-more place from Matt and JenLynn Long. I'm a big fan of their other restaurant - Fusion - and of breakfast, so of course I was very excited when the doors finally opened in late October.  They have created a beautiful space right in the heart of the Downtown Scottsdale action. The patio looks out on the main drag and on my first visit we could have sat out there watching all the amazing women walking in the breast cancer 3-day walk.  Instead we ate inside which was quietly removed from the on-the-street action. The table tops of polished stones were like sitting next to a beach in Florida, and the games were on the bar TVs so my friend was happy.  Breakfast was excellent. I had an omlette made with three eggs - just the right size for me. I hate wasting those five egg monsters at other places. It came with a choice of "potatoes." I chose a hash made with squash and mushrooms.  It was similar to eating sweet potatoes. Breakfast also came with fresh fruit.   My friend appropriately had the Hangover Sandwich with turkey sausage, bacon, and jalape√±os. He wasn't head-over-heels about it,  but hey - he was hungover. All entrees seem to be in the $7.95-$9.95 price range with the seafood add ins like crab costing a little more.  On my second visit I stopped in mid-day for a snack and to check my email. Yes, this place has Wi-Fi!  Unfortunately, they don't really have a "snack" menu yet. I opted for Chips, Salsa & Guac ($4.95). it was a warm green salsa to die for, fresh guacamole, and a mound of chips. I wish I had other people to share with.  Daily Dose just got their liquor license and is opening for dinner as well. I suspect they will add happy hour and happy hour style apps very soon. When that happens, look for me and my computer in the corner.

Crackers & Co just opened in Tempe in the Costco center on Priest and Elliot. It was packed for lunch today - a mix of Mesa's version of Ladies who Lunch and business types.   Had the chicken tortilla soup. It was billed as "very spicy," but not so much. Still, very good and packed with chicken, broth and tortilla strips. You could tell its made fresh.  How I've never heard of the other two locations in Mesa, I don't know. Apparently it's famed for breakfast - my favorite meal. Looking forward to trying it this weekend!

When I first heard about Lobby's via Twitter my first reaction was "So Tempe's jumping in on the gourmet burger trend." I guess I should have known this is not the city for $12 burgs.  Lobby's serves up one of the best, most satisfying burgers I've tasted this side of the Rio Salado - and it comes with a soda and fries for just under $10. I don't know what Lobby puts in that meat. It tastes fantastic - especially with the Lobby Sauce - and fills you up. But even better, I'm never that "why did I eat the whole thing" stuffed when I finish.  Lobby's is conveniently close to my house for those random burger cravings. Did I say convenient. Maybe dangerous is a better word.

Does the Republic Ramen cure the common cold? According to a friend endearingly known as Asian Bob it does.  After a short weekend in Seattle, I came back with the sniffles. Two weeks later and I'm not sure if it's a flu or allergies. Either way, my congested sinuses left me sounding a little like Elmer Fudd. Enter Asian Bob and his spicy remedy to clear out the last of this seasonal sickness.  I hadn't heard of Republic Ramen + Noodles located next to the Phoenix Rock Gym on Dorsey & University. I was surprised at the mod and clean layout - a far cry from the pizza place that used to be here. The staff knew exactly what I needed and soon a huge bowl of ramen was sitting in front of me.  I loved that it was full of spicy broth. It wasn't the hottest thing I've ever eaten, but over the next 12 hours it worked its magic. The next morning I woke up with a clear head and normal voice.  Thanks Republic Ramen!
