Oh this place used to be so good!!!  I think it's under new management and since then, there is absolutely nothing special about this place.  I decided to take some coworkers out to lunch here one day, we wound up back at work having eaten Taco Bell.  First off it took the server 15 minutes to get us our menus.  Then it took another 10 minutes just to get glasses of water.  Finally after being there for a total of about 25 minutes I had to get up and ask the man standing at the front door if he could find someone to come over and take our order.  After asking him to find someone to take our order, a disgruntled server came over and took all six of our orders.  I explained to her that we were on a lunch break, and now barely had about 30 minutes to eat and get back to work.  She assured me that the food would be coming very quickly.  25 minutes later we received our food.  I was so upset I told her to forget it and to just bring us the bill for our drinks.  She offered to wrap up our food so that we could take it to go!  I explained to her that we intended on eating there, and were not planning on eating Mexican food in the car on our way back to work!  She replied, extremely rudely, "well I can't just let you have this food for free." I told her I didn't expect any free food and wasn't planning on eating there ever again.  My entire group wound up grabbing Taco Bell on the way back to work. I'm not sure if this place is under new management but, when I used to come here about six years ago, before the remodel, this place was amazing!  They used to have the best, most authentic Mexican food in the valley what a shame.  The man who I assumed was either the owner or the manager was completely useless.  The waitstaff seems to run this place now and they are extremely rude!  The attitude that I received from the server was such that I wouldn't touch their food with a 10 foot pole, as I have absolutely no guarantee that she didn't take my food back and spit in it. Before the remodel this place was so good!  They used to have the most authentic green corn tamales, calabasitas, and the red chili sauce was absolutely incredible!!!!  I am Hispanic, and I can say without a doubt I had a better lunch at Taco Bell with friendlier customer service.  I will never set foot in this restaurant again, and I will never ever recommend it. You can remodel a building, but it doesn't make a damn bit of difference if the food and the customer service is this terrible.

I've been going here since it was "off the grill" which closed up shop.  The owners were always nice and gave me so much food they had to tape the boxes up.  Well last week I spent 50 bucks (includes a generous tip) on a delivery and wound up on the toilet all night as well as vomiting into a Macy's bag.  Nothing quite like that extreme terror of which end is more important.  The sweet an sour chicken tasted "off" to me but I shrugged it off since I usually get orange chicken, I thought maybe sweet and sour wasn't my thing.  Man...never again.  Too bad, I used to enjoy this place but the service and quality of food has gone down.

Number 37.... Awesome!  Quaint place, small but inviting.  Clean and funny listening to the employees yell at each other in Vietnamese.  Decent wine and beer selection.  The pork on the 37 was AWESOME, and I'm not a huge pork fan.  Sliced thin, juicy and full of sesame ginger flavor.  Who can turn down an egg on a perfectly cooked scoop of white rice?!  The egg roll  was perfect and the shrimp....wow.  I'll be ack VERY SOON!  Wanted to try the boba but no time, I was on lunch break.

I love this place.  Ive been coming here since it was Bobby Mcgees, but now I can't go home after work without coming to my favorite spot to have "supper."  The very best thing about this place is not only the awesome food (in all these years I've NEVER had a bad meal) but the people who work here.  Ciara, Anthony and Jo are AMAZING.  You'd be hard pressed to find a spot like this where the minute you walk in, they are waiting for you and remember what you drink; it's like being at home, only better.  I suggest the smokehouse burger (heaven in your mouth) and the brisket and filet mignon, all incredible.  IF for some reason your meat isn't cooked as you like it, they make it right, no questions.  In the many years I've been coming here I have NEVER met a rude server/bartender.  Ciara knows her way around the bar and can handle it when ya three people deep with such sweet charm as she explains your "supper" options.  Anthony knows what you drink and if he's having a bad day you'll never know it.  Jo is just plain sweet but when it comes to her customers, you are top priority.  Word of advice, anyone can go down the street to Texas Roadhouse and watch a bunch of fools dancing on peanut shells and screaming at you over the horrible music, I come here because of the food, but mostly because of the incredible servers.  Don't screw them on their well deserved tips, they work VERY hard to please everyone here.  Belly up to the bar, or grab a cozy booth, either way you'll leave pleasantly full and happy.

I'm getting pretty close to not setting foot in here again.  Here's why: As a regular, I not only go there for the food, but because of the people.  I have known these servers and bartenders for years, right up until they get shopped and fired.  That's right folks, my meals are usually almost ALWAYS ruined by some idiot shopping a beloved server or bartender of mine and I have to sit there and listen to Joe Shmo ask moronic questions like (no joke) "can my daughter have a beer?  She's sixteen....what's the legal age to consume alcohol?"  Now as a former secret shopper myself for a LARGE company, here's a few words of advice, train your shoppers, a want ad in the newspaper is ridiculous.  If you care THAT much about customer service, let your customers be your shoppers, because I can spot these idiots when they walk in, and most of them LOVE the idea of judging a young person and making them sweat for their job.  Shame on you.  Secondly as a loyal customer, the way I was treated by your shoddy excuse of management when having an allergic reaction to peanuts in your dessert was appalling.  Here's my assessment as a former shopper:  1.) When I asked the wait staff if the chocolate dessert had peanuts in it, they seemed sure it did not, but nobody could be sure because it wasn't printed on the menu.  Upon having two bites of the dessert my mouth immediately swelled up and I had an allergic reaction.  Ciara and Toni were very concerned and attentive, offering water and even a concoction to help me purge the food if needed.  They both kept a watchful eye on me while making sure to not neglect other patrons. 2.) I asked to speak to a manager to merely suggest for the second time (this happened before with their banana dessert) that as an establishment, they should protect themselves by listing peanut ingredients on the menu.  The manager replied that usually when someone has an allergy they tell the server and then the server tells the kitchen, thus making me the customer feel like it was a failure on my part to notify and announce my allergy to the entire restaurant upon my arrival.  Sitting there astounded, I asked if I was indeed hearing what I was hearing, and she glossed over it, thanked me for the feedback, said they were going to reprint their menus at some point, offered to call "someone"I'm assuming an ambulance, and pat me on the back and left.  Really?  So here's the deal, the food is good, the servers and bartenders are the best.  Pretty much everyday they work in fear of losing their job, and I can't support that.  They remember what you drink, how you like your food prepared, your name, and that's not something you get in chain restaurants, but the regulars, the ones who you could count on to support the place, they've slowly disappeared, and I'm headed that way myself.  Unless you've been sitting at your spot, enjoying your meal only to have it RUINED by some jerk shopping your friend and one of many favorite bartenders or servers, you don't know what sick is.  Getting a job in today's economy is difficult enough, but these people treat the mostly 20 something employees like slave  workers who are fortunate to be breathing the bobby q air.  I can't fathom going in to work everyday wondering if it's my last.  Finally, when a regular has a concern like PUT PEANUTS ON YOUR MENU, it's not just for the patrons benefit, but your own, and you failed to see that, instead you shrugged me off and couldn't get out of my presence fast enough; I know when I'm being patronized, don't forget, I can shop you too, and you failed big time, as in you'd be fired.  Good customer service is what Pita Jungle did where they asked me for my phone number or email address to discuss further (turned out to be pine nuts that were most likely cross contaminated).  So in conclusion, when you look around and wonder where all the regular money was that you could always count on coming in every dY at the same time, it's probably at the Black Angus, one of your former regulars is now a regular there, people can go there and grab some food and a drink or two without witnessing the torture you inflict on you're employees.  Shame on you.

I have thought long and hard about reviewing this place. It pains me to review a place and give it such remarks as I will in the following. The only attribute to this place is a handful of doctors, not all, who are incredibly gifted, but I fear they are in it for the exorbitant amount of money they are receiving.  They are doing themselves a disservice by associating with a place like this.  On the other hand they are bringing what little integrity can be brought to this place, so it's a Catch-22.    My little Ruby was close to the end, I know that, and I knew that she was on borrowed time. What I was not expecting was to take her to this place on a Saturday night, but, be that as it may, the front desk girl was extremely nice and we were able to get her seen immediately which is unusual for this place as I have been there before. Within 15 to 20 minutes the female doctor came out and rushed through what was wrong with her. All I remember were words like kidney failure, organ failure, seizures, medications, etc. it is still a mystery to me how this all started so suddenly, and to this day that question has not been answered for me. This female doctor left after continually repeating The same terms followed by "do you understand?"  No I do not understand, and I never will. Another woman came out and said Ruby was to stay overnight so that they could stabilize her as she had just had a seizure and was low on oxygen.  I paid almost $3000 for her care in the end, only to ultimately have to put her down; we are just dollar signs to them.  I agreed to the money and to her staying overnight as this was my furbaby and money was no object, even though I was well aware I was being financially raped.  I asked if I could come back and say goodbye to her for the evening, a relatively harmless request but this Tech acted like it was something that was top-secret and she had to go ask the vet first.  My first tip to her would've been just be honest if there is surgery being performed I do not want to interrupt the sterile field I'm no idiot, so please don't treat me like one. I got to say good night to her and left the building.  The next day I came in and was told Ruby was okay with her oxygen levels and was ready to be released, but there was a whole list of aftercare and prescriptions she needed. This was on a Sunday and unfortunately I was still left at their mercy.  An extremely rude tech came in and expounded on the diet that Ruby was to follow, the prescriptions she was to start taking, and then mentioned that at this point it was considered hospice care.  HOSPICE CARE?!  I was floored! Angered. I asked her to explain what she meant by hospice care since nobody had mentioned this before I had shelled out so much money!  Again with attitude she repeated herself and basically stated that it was only a matter of time before Ruby was to die. And she was to do it at home unless we chose an alternative (keep her there for more tests) This had never been mentioned before and especially not since I had forked out the $1500 previously.   I took my dog home. She made it through the day BUT suffered tremendously. She couldn't breathe, she urinated all over herself. She couldn't stand, she barely ate, her blood pressure was high which she had never had a problem with before, and was now on medication for, she was not my dog and was completely out of it and it broke my heart.  That night she started whining, almost begging me for death. Once again we made the short treck to the emergency clinic with my limp dog in my arms and urine all over me I asked them to put her down. Of course this cost me another $260, which is normally $70 at my vet. I asked them to do this immediately and waited 15 minutes at least, until my mother went out in tears and asked the receptionist to get someone back here to put her down. The vet finally came back and this man was the only angel of mercy there. He sat down with me and asked me if I've ever done this before.  I told him yes many times, and begged him to please do this and get it over with to finally put her out of her misery. He administered the two shots and my dog died in my arms. He told me we could stay there as long as we needed to and to drive home safely, but the genuine care and concern in his eyes was not lost on me.  Had it not been for this place I would have euthanized my animal sooner. She suffered because of YOU and your greed.  You sent her to her death trying to soak me for more money, shame on you!  Take a good look at my profile picture which I have had for years, this is the sweet animal that you sent home to suffer, over medicate (she wasn't even ten pounds) and you call yourselves compassionate. The only one there that was compassionate was the doctor who kindly put my dog down Dr Corona?   People who come to you are understandably upset, not necessarily rich, and need things explained to them.  They are in shock, understand that, maybe your ratings will go up

This guy is amazing....just amazing.  Friendly, reasonable, prompt, the ultimate in customer service.  He came out to our house on a holiday to repair our phone.  I cannot recommend him enough.  The phone looks brand new, after having a mishap with a parking garage floor.  The shattered screen was gone and a new one replaced in less than 15 minutes.  Seriously folks, if you want someone who knows how to fix your iPhone, is customer service oriented, tech savvy and simply amazing, this is your guy.  Thanks Miles!

Sometimes when life is gloomy, the weather cold, or you're just tired of leftover holiday food, TMI is the cure.  The first time I tried Mindy's Mac and Cheese I knew I had to try everything on this menu.  Unfortunately I'm gluten and dairy sensitive, but this is one of those dishes that I willingly indulge in knowing full well what the consequences will be.  The sandwiches and salads are great, with a lot of locally grown ingredients.  The RB & C being one of my favorites.  Presentation is great, simple, nothing pretentious, and really meshes well with their ambiance.  Why four stars?  This place gets crowded!  It's hit or miss really, but when it's packed, it's packed.  In the summer the place is just too hot.  The building is a renovated house in a trendy, hip area, with tunes piped through to the outside patio to match the vibe.  Honestly if you don't mind a crowded space you'll love it.  For me, I would probably frequent more often if it weren't for the parking chaos.  Lucky residents in the neighborhood walk here to grab a cold one, or enjoy a nice crisp wine.  The beverage selection is by far one of the more unique in this city, with Red Robins and Chili's on every corner.  There are a lot of local brews and quite nicely selected wines that pair well with everything.  Overall, this place is one of my favorites with great meals, great beverages, good vibes and good company.  One final plus is that the owners are always around, and often walking through meticulously arranging settings, cleaning the bathroom, etc.  For neat-freaks like me, that says a lot!  One thing that would be great would be some more dairy and gluten-free options in the future for folks like me, who would love to pig out more without feeling so bad the next day!

Lynn, you are the BEST!  Let me tell you all about this business, and the owner Lynn.  First off, this man has integrity, honesty, good character, sense of humor, and knows his s;%#!  We had window units in the house forever.  Lynn gave a  competitive price and didn't jack us around on unnecessary items/expenses.  He was patient with my financial situation, did amazing work, was very knowledgable, and just flat out knows what he's doing.  If it weren't for yelp I wouldn't have found him.  My father is a contractor and immediately said, "this is the guy for us, he speaks like a tradesman, and knows what he's doing."  I can't say enough good things about Cool Guys!  If you want a new unit put in, want someone you can trust, this is the guy...period.  Thank you Lynn!  I'm actually cold already in the house, the electric bill is a fraction of what it was, and you did a fantastic job.  Highly Recommended A+++++

Every time I go in there, they are understaffed, out of ingredients, and I never get consistency with my smoothies.  Also the tip jar doesn't go to the employees, rather to a "charity."  Highly suspect.  Won't be going again unless they make some changes.

Fresh ingredients, awesome team and FANTASTIC pizza!  I can't understand for the life of me why the Chick-Fill-A is always more crowded.  Who would want greasy hormone chicken when you can have your own pie ready to go in a shorter time and with awesome fresh ingredients?!  I'm one loyal customer!
