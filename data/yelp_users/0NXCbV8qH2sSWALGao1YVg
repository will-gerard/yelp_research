This is the worst dealership, I am sure, in the entire world. My experience has been horrible from beginning to end.  Hold on tight, because this is hard to believe. I began my inquiry for a purchase on January 1st.  I started with a phone call..I explained to them that i was extremely limited on time because my father was dying and I was one of the hospice caretakers for him.  I wanted to get all of the preliminaries done over the phone, so I would not be at the actual dealership for hours.  They took all my info over the phone and assured me that the approval was done, so all I needed to do was come down and see the car they chose for me.  My situation was challenged in the sense that I was so upside down in my trade in.  So a vehicle had to be chosen with lots of rebate to bury the upside downess of my trade in. I walk in after my telephone approval and when I entered the dealership to see the salesman I spoke to on the phone.  It became a draw of short sticks and I was settled in with Bob Crandal  ( very nice, but clueless)  they did not have any of the information i gave to them on the phone, so we had to start the whole credit check, etc.  all over.  (my bad, I should have walked out)  I stayed and was there for 5 hours. They explained to me that I was approved (again) and they set me up with Barry one of the finance guys.  This guy used extremely foul language over and over again thinking he was funny. He was not. Barry explained to me that  I should come back the next day, because he was sure he could get me a better interest rate. I telephoned them the next day and explained AGAIN, that I was limited on time, so I asked if all was done and I could just come in and finish up. they said that they thought it was all done, but would call me back. Never heard from them.  In a strong effort to keep this review short...I will tell you that I finally got back into the dealership on January 10th, for another 7 hour visit, and drove off with my new Kia Sorrento with 3 miles on it.  I was happy and the financing was do able. Had the car for over a month and realized (after my father died) that I never received anything from a bank to tell me where to make my payment to.  I called dealership multiple times and left messages and  never received a phone call back. I finally reached someone after a week, and was told, they were happy that I called as the bank withdrew my loan as I was self employed.  Whatever...and meanwhile, I now have a thirty day late on my credit report as the payment was not made in time for my trade in...Ugh... They were gonna work a deal with another lender. Never heard back. Fiinally a week later I spoke with their finance manager and he explained that he had GOOD NEWS...they found a lender to take the loan.  I went in to sign more papers. They secured  a loan for 19% interest. I called back AGAIN several times and left many messages to find out what was going on with this new loan and to find out what I needed to do.  No response.  I took charge and called the owner of business Mark.  Another voice mail again.  I explained that I just wanted my trade in back and I was gonna take my business elsewhere. Finally, after several days,  I received a call saying that they agreed that they had done me wrong and agreed to return my trade in. Basically, I had this new Kia Sorrento for two months.  I went in to retrieve my trade in.  I was assured that it would be just a few minutes, to pick up trade in, retrieve my down payment money and be on my way. another 2 hours.  They lost my down payment checks, my license plate, etc.   I drove off with my old car that was barely driveable (in very good condition when I traded it in) I made it to the new dealership Riverview Toyota barely with my rough riding car with a torn up power steering because their was water in the power steering resevoir. Thank God Riverview Toyota was so wonderful.  I was in and out in 2 hours with my new Toyota with great interest rate and low payments.  It was effortless. I know this is a long review, and I have left out a ton of derragatory information as it is boring and honestly HARD TO BELIEVE... STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!  They are unorganized and have not a clue of what they are doing...I wanted to stay with KIA...but am happy to be a Toyota owner now.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I have never had to write a bad review, however, this one is necessary, especially as a local business owner.  Plez read to the bottom. I have wanted to go to this resturaunt for a long time.  I am involved in the arts, including the downtown Mesa artwalk.  I chose to go on this past artwalk night. I took a friend and my two grandchildren.  Our server was friendly and informative.  Even though they did not have a kids menu, they offered a few items not on the menu.  That was nice. My friend ordered a burger off the kids choice as well.  A few short minutes later, the server explained they were out of adult size burgers.  No problem.  She ordered a pasta dish off the menu and asked for the Alfredo to be placed on the side.  No problem is what the server said. Burgers for the kids arrived and they were huge..sort of like an adult burger.  Pasta was delivered mixed with Alfredo.  My friend explained she had requested it on the side.  The server removed the plate to fix, and he apologized.  He came back to explain that the chef was unable to put Alfredo on the side.  Really?  Omg... The Ceasar salad I had was very very good...one of the best in town for sure...my appetizer was very good, but extremely small portion for the price. Now here comes the worst part... My grandaughter went to use the restroom.  She was only in there for a minute when she came out holding her head with tears in her eyes.  She told me that the picture had fallen off the wall.  I felt her head and she had a very large bump forming already.  I went into the restroom to not only finding just any picture on the ground but a large canvas about 4' x 5' held up by a heavy wrought iron frame, hung on the wall by a single small nail.  This entire art piece was on the floor with the tiny nail left in the wall. I immediately told the server who said "I'm sorry."  I said that I should probably talk with the manager, so he introduced me to the owner, who was rude and uncaring.  He said that he would get ice, which he did.  A 3 pound bag of ice, and sent us on our way. We were so very disappointed in this entire situation.  I live downtown Mesa, so this would have been my dining and night spot..this visit, was ridiculous and I will never go back, and have and will continue to tell everyone I know of the experience. Sorry guy, you made a few poor choices in customer service and human care..

I am no going to get into details, but I did want to take the time to say that from beginning to end...this dealership and my salesman Kenny and finance manager Mike...were absolutely incredible. I had a really seriously bad experience with Mark Kia...and these folks pulled me out of it. My experience was the best I have ever had in all the experiences I have had purchasing a vehicle.  There have been many. I will recommend this dealership to every single person i EVER come in contact with. Thank you Riverview Toyota.  I love my Corolla.  You fit me into a car I did not ever think I would like.  You took notes on my needs and clearly knew what I didn't... thank you thank you...

I recant the above mentioned rave on Riverview Toyota.  Paperwork lost multiple times, things wrong with car (like gas cap is broken) have been waiting on that call for 3 weeks now.  (good thing it's good on gas and haven't needed to put gas in it)  Finally, I speak to the corporate Manager (after multiple calls not returned)  Funding has not occurred yet for some reason, so I took it into my own hands...I'll keep you updated when funding happens...so far there is NO service after the sale though...Damn!!!

I recently moved to the area, and this was one of the first places I checked out... In the past 3 months I have been here several times.. Service rocks!!! Friendly,informative, and very accommodating!   Sciracha/honey wings grilled are the bomb diggity!  Burgers and fries phenomenal!  Had their Caesar salad last week and it was great.. Everything is fresh and clean.  Food and establishment wise.. I've been when it's crazy busy and a little slower... Great service every time... They make the best old fashioned in the valley.. Bartenders are excellent at their craft!   Enjoy!
