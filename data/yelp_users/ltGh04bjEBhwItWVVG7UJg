What a fantastic part of both the downtown area and the local theater scene!  Herberger Theater Center has a lovely outdoor area, complete with fanciful sculptures and at least one arch (pictured) to welcome meanderers prior to a show.  After visiting the Will Call window, it's hard to miss the glorious chandelier (pictured) under the atrium.  A theater wouldn't be complete without a bar area for drinks and snacks and HTC has got you covered.  The word "Center" in the title is no accident.  This facility does not have just one theater, but a minimum of two, that I noticed.  The chairs are made of comfy, red velvet and there isn't a bad seat in the house.  Be sure to enjoy a show and support a local theater with local and national acts/shows ASAP.  You won't be disappointed!  :)

Five stars?  Oh, so close!  I've stopped in to Pane Bianco a couple of times and have enoyed the non-commercial sandwiches here.  And by "non-commercial", I mean the type my Italian Mom used to make when I was a kid.  On my first visit I had what amounted to the caprese sandwich (mozzarella, tomato & basil.)  PB is known for its mozzarella, so I wasn't surprised by its goodness, but I swear the sprig of basil must have been just picked that day...so flavorful and fragant.  It really made the sammy!  The price was about $8.50.  If I would have stopped there, PB would have have five stars.  On my second visit I had the Market Sandwich (mortadella, peach relish, pecorino and greens).  The mortadella seemed a bit flavorless.  It was sliced thin (which I love) but could have used an extra layer.  It just seemed as though the pecorino (perhaps due to the saltiness) and sweetness of the peach relish (a slight departure from the website description) overpowered the mortadella.  In fact, the sandwich was a bit on the dry side and could have used a bit more of the relish for moisture, especially in light of the fact this type of bread tends to be on the dry side.  The relish really shouldn't be any sweeter as, it too, runs the risk of overpowering the flavor of the meat.  If Chris Bianco can find a way to add greater volume to the relish without adding any additional sweetness, I'd give PB five stars!  Now, if only something can be done about the $11 price tag, this could be an "A+" sandwich!  Feel like getting experiemntal at home?  Be sure to grab a freshly baked loaf before you leave.  A bargain at just $3.  My only real disappointment is that PB isn't open on Sunday.  Hopefully, they'll expand once Lux moves from the space they occupy next door and Pane Bianco will have reason to expand both their space AND their hours of operation.  Who knows...maybe even offer some vino???  I still crave Pane Bianco and can't wait to go back,  I'm already salivating over the Soppressata with Aged Provolone & Roasted Peppers.  Hmm, maybe it'll be just like Mom used to make.

Niccoli's is a great little neighborhood deli. It offers meats, cheeses, desserts and a small selection of Italian staples to take home.  The woman (co-owner???) behind the counter is very sweet and I'm very happy to patronize (what appears to be) a family-owned local business.  Having said that, I'd love to see an expanded selection of fresh loaves of Italian bread.

Looking for a light lunch at Miracle Mile Delicatessen? Oy! You won't find it here!  I was stuffed fuller than the turkey on my challah ever could have been. The "special" is described as a 1/2 sandwich and (either side salad or) cup of soup. I had no idea it also came with French fries and a pickle wedge! The turkey was fresh and overflowing over the bread. Try it with a side of cranberry sauce for that "Thanksgiving" flair. The matzo ball soup was also tasty, with the flavor of homemade broth.  It had been quite a while since my last visit to Miracle Mile Delicatessen and the new decor gives it a lighter, airier feel than I remembered. But the service is just as fast  and the portions will leave you stuffed to the max!

I struck gold...twice!  Are you one of those people who has a fear of the dentist's chair? Well, this is the place for you!  I'm originally from out of state and refused to see a local dentist, opting to wait for visits "back home" where I could be seen by my favorite dentist to whom I've been very loyal. He was very skilled and we had a great rapport.  The day finally came when I couldn't wait for that trip back home due to the lifetime supply of plaque in my teeth. A friend recommended Dr. Choules' office because  of the reputation for getting patients out of the chair in time to get to work early in the morning. I had no idea what I'd also find was skilled, friendly, personable service to rival what I left behind back home.  Everyone --- from the front office to the hygienists to the dentists --- have provided professional, sensitive service with a smile. Melissa, in particular, has been a joy to have as my hygienist. We never seem to lack for things to chat about --- which is a challenge when you're having your teeth cleaned! You'll never feel nervous or uncomfortable in her care. She's the most thoughtful, gentle and considerate hygienist anyone could ask for. I hope someone's reading this and giving her a big, fat raise!  So, if you're shopping around for dental care, do yourself a favor and make an appointment here. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and the $50 take home bleaching kit offer with a Yelp check in can't be beat! :D

I succumbed to peer pressure!  Don't you hate it when you don't trust your own instincts?  OK, so Yelp is a great resource and so are friends' recommendations.  But when it comes right down to it, it's all a matter of opinion.  When it comes to Carolina's Mexican Food, mine differs from most.  I've mentioned in other reviews that I love the idea of a mom-n-pop place where local owners are doing their own thing, contributing to the local economy with jobs and paying their taxes.  Plus, this place makes their own tortilla shells. so that's a nice touch.  The food isn't especially memorable.  The machaca or chicken tacos are appropriately sized overall, but contain mostly just iceburg.  See for yourself with the posted pics.  The chicken was flavorless, but the machaca was a bit easier to discern.  Also, the size of the cheese quesadilla was fine, though proportionately had little cheese.  In the interest of safety, I would NOT recommend coming here at night alone.  If you must, be sure you're with a group of people and at least one or two of you have sobered after a night of drinking.  This place is OK for taking care of the munchies.  Just be sure you're careful to be safe in this less-than-stellar neighborhood.

Abysmal.  Was headed to Sky Harbor Airport.  Didn't arrive in quoted time.  No follow up call received.  When I called back for an ETA the additional wait time was longer than the first quote ... and they were already late!  Canceled and scrambled to make other arrangements to avoid missing my flight.  Not reliable and will never call on them again.  Would give "0" stars, if I could (something I've never done in any review.)

I have visited this location on many occasions and have been disappointed one too many times. I'd say that going through the drive-thru has caused me more misery than necessary. I'm sure they've gotten my order wrong a minimum of 75% of the time and today's order included pickle stacked on the top (meaning outside) of the sandwich. Also, while waiting at the drive-thru window one time I even had the employee chat me up a bit during a long wait for food. He had the nerve to complain that McDonald's required that he take a test and that he failed it. (Shocking!) Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs.

It had been about three or four years since I last visited Jay's Gyros and thought I'd check it out again, hoping to find a meal which wasn't as forgettable as my last. It was.   The people here have no sense of customer service. While it's a quick serve restaurant and I didn't plan on five star service, a mere "hello", "thank you" or a simple smile would have been nice. The person taking my order didn't know the correct pronunciation of the word "gyro".  Once my order was ready, it was placed on the counter and I only knew that because I barely heard a whisper of the announcement.  She couldn't speak up?!?  The facility is old and the furnishings dated. In fact, I think one of the interior pics posted here may also be outdated, as I don't recall the blue booth-style seats shown. Little effort has been made to spruce up the interior; not so much as blue paint on the walls which is common for Greek restaurants. There was one large screen TV with soccer on, but don't plan on catching a game here. The glare from the lights above would tick off any serious fan.   I ordered the chicken gyro (about $6) and Greek fries (about $2.50.) Both were made to order and served hot. They fries were OK, but the paper bowl they were served in had been soaked through with lemon juice, making for a messy dish. The pita was fine, but nothing to write home about. The fixin's (romaine, tomato and onion) were crisp, cool and plentiful, but I didn't care for the rectangular strips of chicken at all. They didn't look, smell, have the texture of or even taste like chicken. They seemed just like frozen, processed pieces of mystery meat they got from some mass distributor of restaurant food.   One other thing I don't understand is their odd hours. Greek restaurants don't often serve breakfast and have to rely on their lunch and dinner business. Jay's closes at 4:00pm, so it's either lunch or the special-less early bird special. Guess I'll have to use the Del Taco drive-thru next door. I think their mystery meat is available 24/7.

How can this place have nearly five stars?  The atmosphere is fine if you're looking for a casual, family friendly kind of restaurant.  The service was fast and cordial, but the pizza left so much to be desired.  We ordered two pizzas.  One was a thin crust "Deluxe Combo" (pictured) which was passable, but nothing to write home about.  The other was a "Pesto Bianca" with chicken added (pictured) which I almost sent back --- and I never send food back.  The crust was burnt to a non-edible char; my teeth literally could not bite into it.  The chicken (which I paid extra to have!!!) was dry beyond belief.  It had a texture that made me think it was day-old chicken tossed onto a grill to merely reheat was had previously been overdone.  I was surprised that someone in the back-of-house allowed this pizza to leave the kitchen.

I had high hopes for this place, but was a bit disappointed.  Upon arrival, I was greeted outdoors by a young man with a pleasant smile and who was kind enough to grab the door for me.  Sadly, it went downhill from there.  A woman saw me approach the counter to place my order.  She walked away and didn't return for several minutes.  No explanation.  No apology for the wait.  According to the menu, the Carnitas Burrito was supposed to come with Spanish rice, lettuce and tomato, but didn't.  There was nothing but meat inside.  The portion size and meat flavor were good, but it wasn't what I ordered.  It's like going to a burger joint to get a cheeseburger and not getting any cheese.  No one dies, but it's odd.  I will say the patio space is lovely for an evening outdoors.  This place has potential, but Customer Service and Quality Control both need improvement.

It's sad when the best part of a meal isn't even what a restaurant is known for,  I'll keep it short and SWEET.  The chicken was mediocre. The waffles were good. The grits were ok, as best as I could tell, given it was my first time eating grits. The ambiance wasn't great, but about what I expected, given the location. The location was scary. The service was functional. The best part of the meal was the SWEET tea served in a mason jar...and I do mean SWEET!  I can't say I'd want to go back, but might if others wanted to.  I would offer some other restaurant choices, if asked.

I was in a hurry one late afternoon and craving a salad. Luckily, Crazy Jim's was nearby to save me!   Housed in an older building, Crazy Jim's is in a so-so neighborhood, and while I felt comfortable walking from the back parking lot alone, I probably wouldn't do so after dark. It's a small place with wooden tables (carved with Crazy Jim's logo) situated rather close to one another. Luckily I was there late afternoon and didn't need to deal with a large lunch or dinner crowd.   I had the basic Greek salad with home made creamy Greek dressing. I'm often disappointed by salad dressing, but not this time...it was great! The portion size was large enough for an entree, but could suffice for two or more to share as a side. Many restaurants skimp on everything but iceberg, but this salad had several pieces of kalamata olives and the feta was piled high!   The highlight of the meal had to be the pita. Served warm and cut into quarters, it was probably the most flavorful I've ever had! Too bad I didn't ask for extra to go.   My server was fast, friendly and knowledgeable; so helpful with questions I posed about menu items. Speaking of which, since I've sampled so little of it, I'll be back to try the gyro pita and a few others I expect I will love!

Barrio Cafe serves up nontraditional Mexican.  Okay. So some have complained this place does not offer traditional Mexican food. If you are looking for Taco Bell or Del Taco style fixings consider going elsewhere. But if you're looking for a cool and new twist on Mexican flavors this could be your spot.  The service here was quick and attentive. The busboy was fast to bring a basket of bread and an amazing olive spread (pictured.)  The flavors of the spread were pungent enough to be memorable yet not overpowering.  A side salad (pictured) was included with my lunch. It had a flavorful mixture of Roquefort cheese, dried cranberries, spinach and salsa. It would have been perfection had it not been for the too-spicy balsamic vinaigrette dressing which nearly disguised all the other flavors.  The Torta de Filetito (pictured) was my entree. The first decision I had to make was how to tackle it. It was piled too high to eat as a sandwich, yet trying to slice through the crusty bread (even with a steak knife) proved to be nearly impossible.  The fillet mignon was flavorful, though could have been a bit more tender. It was also to have included chorizo though I found no sign anywhere...or could it have simply had no flavor and been mistaken for the chipotle wine sauce???  The portion size was more than ample though many pictures of the same entree on yelp.com display this entrée with french fries. I did not see french fries on the menu nor were they presented on the plate. Could this have been what the restaurant considers a "lunch portion" or was it nearly forgotten?  A few tweaks and this place could be a five-star restaurant, in my opinion. I realize that space is at a premium though I personally do not care for the unisex restrooms. (One of the two was out of order, but this is the norm here anyway.). I may try this place a second time someday and if I do I think I'd like to try their margaritas.

Contrary to some of the reviews I've seen posted, my experience with the wait staff was rather good. There were two servers in duty during lunch; both friendly and attentive. Maybe the tide has turned!  The Tomato Bisque was VERY flavorful and came with two small-ish pieces if Garlic Bread which were fine, but didn't wow me. I'd also give the Greek Salad two thumbs up. Many restaurants show no restraint with the dressing and drown it in overpowering grease. Carly's was light and just enough to coat the delicate greens. While I've never seen pickled onions on a Greek salad, I do love their full flavor.  But the stars of the salad were the Kalamata olives and green olives that were packed with pungent flavor.  The Prosciutto sandwich (prosciutto, fig paste, provolone and Gorgonzola) was nearly a five-star sandwich. The flavor of the fig paste was very good although contained almost too much fig and drowned the sandwich in sweetness. The Orzo was the most disappointing part of the meal; it was too bland to be at all memorable. I sure hope they give this side dish a bit more thought and bring it to life.  All in all I was happy with my Carly's Bistro experience. I hope to be back to visit sometime soon.

A stop on a (non-First) Friday afternoon to MJ Bread and Tammie Coe Cakes left me very satisfied!   Half the fun of visiting this shop is examining all the pretty cakes on display. While there were a few, there were fewer than I'd hoped for. I'd like to think they were so good they sold out before I arrived at 12 noon.   And, apparently timing is everything. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich on a croissant (pictured) and within minutes was told they were out of croissants. I was bummed. Low and behold, the woman at the counter quickly learned my sandwich had already been made and announced it was my "lucky day", taking the last of the croissants; tall with its multi-layers. The chicken salad filling was good, though nothing to write home about.   Temptation got the best of me, as I suspect it does others. I kept control settling for the mini portion of the chocolate cupcake (pictured). It was truly one of the best cakes I've tasted in a long time, though the orange (it's Halloween season) butter cream frosting was piled a little too high for my taste.   All in all, my visit was a pleasant one and I had a lovely outdoor lunch. I hope to be back soon for one (or more!) of their grab-n-go sliders.

When you walk to the door at Dick's Hideaway you're immediately greeted by the aroma of slow roasting pork wafting through the air. My mouth was watering before even being seated. This place is small and seating is limited, almost cramped...but I was happy that we were seated so quickly, given it was a busy Friday night. If you're lucky enough to have a seat at the bar you can watch all the action take place live.. However, if your a party of two, be forewarned that you could be seated at a very small table where both guests are literally staring at a wall.  Fortunately, the cramped seating and odd view are quickly forgotten when the food arrives. Both dishes were succulent and moist, not to mention full flavor. The server was friendly and was quick to bring over a couple of wine samples before having to make a final decision.  Another Yelper commented on the cold temperature within the restaurant. Granted it was about 113° on the day of our visit, but if there was air conditioning on in the restaurant I couldn't feel it. All in all, Dick's Hideaway is a terrific local gem. I'd like to go back and try their brunch at some point.

A visit to Corbin's Bar and Grill is worthwhile, even if driving out of the way to get there. The service was polite and attentive and it was a pleasure to see every square inch of this place (including the rest room) was spotless.  The applewood smoked bacon (flavor of the day)  Mac and Cheese was creamy, flavorful, crispy and golden on top. They use real cheese here, folks...none of that artificial manufactured stuff here!  The Peppercorn Burger (with grilled caramelized onions and Dijon mustard brandy sauce) was good and appealingly presented although the bun left something to be desired. The typical side dish offerings could be upgraded to the "00" Rings for an additional three dollars. The aïoli sauce as advertised in the full version of these onion rings would've been nice to have but were absent from the upgrade.  All in all, lunch at Corbin's was a good experience. I think I'll be back to try some of their other options like their salads and desserts.  Hopefully, they'll consider offering WiFi by then.

Let me just say the Orange Blossom cupcake was good, but the Rosewater butter cream frosting was out of this world!!!  The only thing I could think of when I took a bite was --- this ACTUALLY tastes like butter!  It wasn't until later, when I read the menu description, that I realized it was a Food Network Cupcake Wars winner.  I guess I don't watch enough TV.  Regardless, I'm very happy to know now.  Oh, and the Brownie is dense and moist...the way God and the Food Network intended.  :D

Dollar Tree can't be relied upon.  This is the third of their stores I visited. I needed a dozen balloons for a party and tried to purchase them about a week in advance. The first store had balloons, but no helium. The second store had helium, but no balloons. I was told the balloons and helium MUST be purchased at the same store. When I arrived at this location, I purchased a dozen balloons and was PROMISED by the Assistant Manager that he would make sure there was enough helium on hand to fill them the day of the party. He even took my name & phone number and wrote them down on a duplicate copy of my receipt as a reminder to himself.  Fast forward to the day of the party. I arrive and they have no helium and the Assistant Manager and copy of the receipt were nowhere to be found. INFURIATING!  I had a party to get to and no helium for the balloons!  Luckily, I was able to get helium at another location, after all. But what if none were available there, either? This is just proof that Customer Service, even at the management level, lacks at Dollar Tree.

St. Francis is stellar in my book and I think I'll be tempted to give it five stars next time. Looking for a cool, urban, unpretentious place to eat? Then you've found it!   My friend and I went on a Saturday night. Without a reservation, they were able to seat us immediately. This may even have been too fast, as I didn't have an opportunity to have my pre-dinner drink and I'm not one to drink during dinner. While I've read the patio is the place to be, there were no tables (not just "not available" but literally no tables!) which may have been a good thing. With temps hovering around 100 degrees at 8:00pm, the comfort of A/C has it's advantages!   The staff, everyone from the valet to the seating hostess to the server, were on their toes. All were attentive and friendly ... the type of service where you know the tip you gave was well earned.   My friend had the Pot Roast; probably a dish better suited for cooler temps, but delicious and satisfying, nonetheless.  He tells me his wine was also good.  (I'm not much of a wine person, so I can't comment confidently on that.)   I opted for the more season-friendly cool Chicken Salad Sandwich. It was a wonderful combination of flavors. My only concern was that the sandwich began to fall apart, making it difficult to eat neatly in public. It came with a choice of sides and I elected the sweet corn polenta. Oh Em Gee!!! If I didn't know it was polenta, I would've sworn it was Mom's whipped potatoes. Soooo creamy and yummy! And a steal as a standalone for just $3!   St. Francis's ambiance is great for both day or night and seems like the kind of place I'd like to revisit time and time again for anything from brunch to dinner. As the Governator once said, "I'll be back!" :D

As far as I'm concerned, Flo's Chinese Restaurant can expand their mini dynasty into MY neighborhood!  I'd heard largely good things about Flo's and decided to take it in, myself.  Surprise, surprise...it's in a strip mall, but a quaint one at that.  The interior is sorta (sub)urban-chic.  It's a mix of upscale and low-brow with linen table cloths and throwaway paper napkins.  Cool enough for adults, yet casual enough if you're bringing the kids.  I was fortunate in that unlike some other Yelpers, I had no trouble finding a parking spot and the decibel level was comfortable.  The hostess was smiley and seated me right away.  The server and busboy (or is that bus man???) were quick to have ice water, crispy won tons with duck sauce and a complimentary side salad (iceburg, romaine, carrot slivers) on the table within seconds.  It's evident they are aware the lunch crowd may not have time for a long wait.  I didn't go crazy, sticking to a couple of "safe" options ordering the orange chicken with steamed white rice and the Triple Chocolate Mousse.  The dessert was pretty, but just OK for flavor and texture.  However, I have to say the chicken was fantastic; moist without too much batter!  I've had orange chicken at many other restaurants before and have been served lumps of fried dough with an indiscernible amount of actual chicken.  Not the case at Flo's!  The portions were good and the prices very reasonable: just $7 for the lunchtime entree!  Next time I'll take advantage of the $5 special on a Saturday!

Looking for good Philadelphia street eats? Well, Forefathers Cheesesteaks & Fries is the place for you!  While Forefathers' is light on Philadelphia decor like the Liberty Bell, the sandwiches would give fan favorite Philly restaurants like Pat's, Geno's or Jim's a run for their money. And you don't have to be a Cheese Whiz fan. The gooey provolone on my sandwich left my mouth watering. The sweet potato fries were equally good. Be sure to sample the available dipping sauces like ranch, honey mustard, or (my fave) fries sauce.  The next time you're in the mood for cholesterol count busting goodness, be sure to check this place out. Even Ben Franklin wouldn't need his bifocal specs to see that Forefathers is worth a fry...oops, I mean, try.

I was pleasantly surprised by Crackers!  To drive by this place you'd never know what to expect inside. The exterior is rather nondescript, but once you step indoors you'll find that the decor has been updated since the facility was originally built. Albeit a bit dim inside, plus it's a bit strange to see the bar in one corner of the dining room, it makes for pleasant breakfast environment.  The service was polite and prompt and that California Eggs Benny (pictured) we're quite colorful, tasty and, I like to believe (due to the spinach,) healthy. I would definitely consider visiting this restaurant again.  My only criticisms are minor. The restroom was clean and neat although beginning to show its age due to outdated decor. I also didn't care much for the plastic tablecloths. I prefer solid (unprinted) cloth or no tablecloth at all. These, of course, are purely aesthetic and not major detractors.  Free WiFi would be nice for those of us who like to catch up on morning news via our smartphones.  Got a large family to feed for breakfast? Crackers maybe the place for you.

Like many of the recent post-ers, I visited recently to take advantage of an expiring Groupon. While only one couple was in the restaurant when I arrived, the wait for my takeout order was nearly 30 minutes.   My order was for the (1/2) Ground Beef Taco and the Lamb and Potatoes. While I announced, then clarified my order ... THEN watched the order taker clarify it for the cook, my order was still wrong. I didn't want to wait any longer, so I never said a word about it because I needed to leave. What I actually received was the Navajo Taco which includes whole pinto beans instead of ground beef. The shell tasted fine, but fell apart the moment I picked it up from the carryout container. The filling/topping ingredients were fine ... after I picked off the pinto beans which were about half the volume of the toppings. My friend tells me the Lamb and Potatoes was a bit bland and could have used flavor from hot sauce or, at least, salt and pepper.   An odd occurrence while I waited for the food to be prepared was the order taker offered to put lemonade in a restaurant-use-only glass, instead of a carry out cup. Basically, he wanted me to drink all the lemonade while I waited, instead of carry it out. Of course, I firmly, but politely, declined. He then went to the stock area to find the carryout cups. Was this all about avoiding the walk over to the stock area?!?! Why would I consume any beverages there only to carry the food away?   Let's just say Sacred Hogan has plenty of room for improvement. They MUST concentrate on correct order placement, speed of service, cleanliness (I never saw so much as a plastic glove), decor (only 3 wood Navajo carvings being blocked by other stuff exist) and ... oh, how about flavor?!?! I like seeing small mom-n-pop places thrive for many reasons. If SHNF doesn't step it up, (especially when some dishes run $20-$25) I think they'll have difficult times ahead.

I placed an order for two, didn't receive a single napkin and also received the wrong flavor of donuts. It was your typical poor fast food experience. I'm not encouraged to return for another visit.

This store may be small in area but has big bargains inside. Compared to sister store Marshall's, the square footage may be limited but they pack the store with plenty of merchandise in a variety of departments. Its size is similar to most traditional TJ Maxx stores and it's unfair to compare it to Marshall's (or more specifically Marshall's Mega Store) for quantity of items in stock. I've visited this location numerous times and I'm thrilled to have found so many fabulous bargains. I'd much rather shop at this TJ Maxx location then any disastrously disorganized and filthy Ross store.

I am sick and tired of one poor Walmart experience after another. I originally had high hopes for this location. The sad truth is that they have a far lesser selection compared to other stores. Plus I refuse to be locked into the store before it even closes one more time. Isn't this a fire hazard?!?!

It's tough to impress an Italian girl with Italian food. Babbo Italian Eatery left an impression and it was "molto bene!"   The ambiance at Babbo Italian Eatery was cool and urban. It's a dimly lit restaurant; one that's good by day, but I suspect better by night. They have a nice little patio which was a bit noisy (too noisy to hear my favorite band emanating through the speakers!) but that's to be expected at a busy CenPho intersection. I imagine even cool winter nights would be pleasant on the patio warmed by electric heaters. And for what it's worth (I think the ladies will back me on this one) I was very happy to notice the restroom was clean and attractive.   I ordered the Steak and Pesto Pasta (flank steak, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and pesto over penne and topped with shreds of Parmesan and basil.) It was colorful, flavorful and plentful...so much so I could only finish about half. It was slightly on the oily side, but that's par for the course with pesto. The meal also came with a nearly-warm herbed focaccia along with a "not-too-heavy" oil and "just-the-right-amount-of-kick" balsamic plate for dipping.   The service was fast and friendly; the server even chatting me up for a few minutes. He's leaving Arizona soon so I hope the other servers are just as personable on my future visits. For today's visit, Babbo Italian Eatery was "squisito"!

Fox got it right, again!  If you're looking for a cool, trendy, open/airy place to eat, Zinburger's an awesome spot!  On a recent trip, I had the Zinburger signature burger which was moist, tender and flavorful.  Even the soft, yet sturdy, bun was good!  The Sweet Potato Fries came with a yummy Yogurt Dipping Sauce; totally worth the extra $5!  To drink consider the well-poured Lemon Sipper (Skyy Vodka, Mint Leaves, Lemonade) to cool off on a hot, Phoenix day.  I ate indoors, but they have a wonderful, relaxing patio, too.  This place is great for lunch with girlfriends after a day of shopping, but equally as fitting for a Saturday night date.  Kids are welcome, but they'd probably be happier at Mickey D's down the street.

Excuse me, I didn't order this "doggie bag."  I'd always been a fan of Chick-Fil-A.  That is, until my recent visit.  I placed a drive thru order and waited my turn in line behind another vehicle ahead of me.  That vehicle had it's windows rolled down and two (cute!) dogs were in the back seat with their snouts peering out the window.  It seems the drive thru attendant couldn't resist their charms, reached out and allowed at least one of the dogs to lick the palm of her hand, undoubtedly smearing saliva.  When my turn at the window arrived, I was certain the drive thru attendant would first wash her hands before serving me, but that never occurred.  Please don't misunderstand.  I, myself, am a pet owner and love my furry friend.  In my own home I am always sure to wash my hands before touching food, utensils, kitchen surfaces, etc.  I was dumbfounded when I was expected to pay someone else for something I would not allow myself to do.  In the interest of full disclosure, the drive thru attendant did not prepare my food, but she did handle the packaging it came in which, in turn, I also needed to handle to have access to the food.  All I could think about was cross contamination.  Had I not been in a hurry, I would have brought this to the manager's attention instead of throwing away food which may have been very good under other circumstances.

I've unearthed hot dog Nirvana!  I've been Yelping on and off for about nine months and during that time never --- I say NEVER ---  have given five stars to any restaurant.  Much to my surprise and delight, I've found the perfect quick serve meal in the most unlikely of places: a food truck!  The local food trucks and specifically, Short Leash, have had their fair share of "ink" recently and I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me.  The long line in the hot Phoenix weather during last week's Food Truck Friday was long forgotten once I bit into a "Regular" (pictured) with "Lady" toppings.  The hot dog was cooked to perfection with it's slightly crispy casing and flavorful meatiness.  I had no idea it would be served on naan, but loved the soft, light freshness of it all.  And the toppings?  The Lady includes Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed Onions and fried Pickles ... all of which created a wonderful combination of flavors, though did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  I was so impressed with Short Leash that I made a point of visiting again THE VERY NEXT DAY!  This time it was The Chicken (pictured) with Aoki toppings (Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo) which blew me away.  Whoever came up with these flavor combinations is a genius!  And as for the staff, let me just say that they are genuinely THE nicest people around or deserve an Academy Award.  (And remember, they're working hard in the heat, ya know!)  Thank you, Short Leash, for doing it right.  I'll undoubtedly be back for more hot dogs --- and smiles.  But don't worry, I won't complain about the long line.  ;)

I've visited twice recently and was pleased both times.  To me, the atmosphere is more like a quaint, rustic French bistro with a modern flair than it is Mexican, but pleasing, nonetheless.  Pay attention to their hours of operation.  If I had, I would've saved myself a trip on a Sunday, when they're closed.  On one visit, there was only one customer in the restaurant, but that's likely to change once the movie theater upstairs (currently closed for renovations) reopens.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  In fact, if you're nice, the guy behind the bar may tell you a funny story about a trip he once made to a local movie theater!  My friend tells me the nachos (served warm) and salsa were very good and the Taco Salad was crisp and cool.  I opted for the Carne Asada burrito which was very flavorful with its brown sugar and "hot and sweet onion pepper relish".  Both entrees were large enough for leftovers to take home.  If you decide to stop in, be sure to treat yourself to the Empanadas (served in a pair.)  My only gripe is that the menu states they are made of "Flaky puff pastry" when mine seemed more like deep fried tacos.  Overall, I loved the dish.  Don't be fooled by what looks like Buffalo wing sauce topping.  It's actually a "Yucatan BBQ sauce" which makes this a terrific sweet and salty dish (a plus in my book).  If you're looking for traditional Mexican, you'll probably be disappointed, but if you're enthused by trying new and creative food, it'll be right up your alley.  Prices are fair to moderate, but worth it, especially when you factor in Happy Hour discounts.  They're even better with Groupon!  Tip: Parking is conveniently located steps away in the garage behind the facility.  Be sure to get "validated" before leaving the restaurant and your parking fee is waived!

An unclear menu and chalkboard signage, as well as lack of information from our server, lead to confusion.  Like most have said before, my friend and I were very pleased with the atmosphere at Tryst Café in terms of its decor and layout. However, information about specials on the menu and two separate chalkboards lead to confusion about what specials were available (given the day of the week and hour of the day.) When we inquired with our server, she didn't know and had to double check what was included, when specials were available and for what price. I'm not sure if she was new to this job or just insufficiently trained.  Fortunately, Tryst Café delivered in other ways. The drinks were sufficiently strong. My friend tells me her two glasses of Montpellier Cabernet Savignon (pictured) were delicious. My Tryst Pepino was fine, though was missing the mint garnish described on their menu.  The Humus Trio (pictured) was delicious and came with slices of fresh cucumber however, it did not come with the traditional side of pita bread which had to be ordered separately. The Steak Salad (pictured) was amazing and the chunks of meat were oh, so, tender and juicy!  I hope to revisit Tryst Café sometime soon. My only hope is that they clear up some of the confusion about what specials are available and appropriately train their staff to know what is actually included, when specials are available and for what price.

I was in a hurry today and found myself grabbing a quick bite at Joey's of Chicago.  And it's a good thing that it was on this particular occassion I was in a hurry because there was no line/no waiting.  Translation: the place was completely empty and I think I know why.  I rushed in and ordered the Italian Beef.  It was the special on the chalkboard near the front door and the first thing that caught my eye.  Since the lone employee had nothing else to do, she served as greeter, order taker, change maker, sandwich maker and server.  Friendly enough, she asked if I wanted the juice on the sandwich or the side.  I actually like flavorful, soggy bread so it suited me to have it on the bread.  It's probably no surprise but, if you don't, you're better off ordering it on the side for dipping, instead.  The beef, itself, wasn't prepared to order, but sat in a steamer or some such vessel.  It was served hot, but cooled too quickly.  The flavor was ok, but the meat had a few pieces of grizzle I had to tear away.  That's no fun if the food is already in your mouth!  The restaurant was largely clean.  The decor was obviously Chicago themed with a large mural (a large stick-on photo) of the Chicago skyline on one wall and several street signs of well-known Chicago streets pearched at booths.  Even so, I didn't feel like I was in Chicago; just another Phoenix restaurant likely to be out of business by the time the lease runs out.  5/9/2012 Update: This place has closed?  Yikes, do you suppose it was my comment?  :::Shrug:::

Province serves up "provincial" in an urban, contemporary setting.  I knew lunch would be something to remember when I entered the Westin Hotel lobby.  It may seem like a small thing and it was more of a lobby detail than restaurant detail, but the place smells AMAZING!  It's not the smell of food, but an aroma of clean-meets-floral-meets-subdued-men's-aftershave that made me stop in my tracks to take in the moment.  So, on to the restaurant.  The decor is refined-urban-contemporary and is nearly as inviting as the perfume in the lobby.  It's clean and comfortable without being pretentious.  Our server was friendly and advised us to expect South American flavors.  While he and the bus person were both very attentive, I did find it odd that we were never asked the typical "Is everything OK?" question, though everything was more than OK.  We started with a crudites which included a pair of warm mini-muffin shaped carbs of some sort (pardon my ignorance), three pieces of crunchy, flat bread sticks (which to me tasted like glorified Goldfish Crackers) and a mini ramekin of velvety chickpea and dill dip.  The dip was great, but I could have passed on the rest.  My friend started with the (pictured) Tortilla Soup (avocado, rotisserie roasted chicken) which I'm told was creamy and robust with flavor.  The chunks of chicken were meaty and moist.  We shared the (pictured) Heirloom Tomato & House Made Mozzarella Salad (pickled onions, cilantro almond dressing.)  This was almost too pretty to eat with its artfully arranged colors of heirloom tomatoes and the oh-so-flavorful pickled onions.  For the entree my friend ordered the (pictured) Spice Rubbed Grilled Shrimp Tacos (ancho aioli, pickled cabbage slaw, house corn tortillas) and am told the (what seemed to be braised) shrimp were very good.  I ordered the (pictured) Grilled Berkshire Pork Tenderloin (anson mills grits, brussel sprouts, adobado.)  I requested to substitute the brussel sprouts and was easily accommodated with a switch to a vegetable medley.  The pork was super moist, though just shy of evenly cooked.  The adobo sauce was flavorful, but not so overpowering that is took away from the flavor of the meat.  The grits were fine but I couldn't get enough of the mixed veggies (carrots, squash, onion, kale, etc.)  On the way out, the hostess chatted us up a bit and we learned the decorative moss wall is real...she mists it every day to keep it thriving.  The bartender thanked us for stopping by, even though we never had an opportunity to have a drink at the bar.  He tells us the pink chairs positioned at an angle are supposed to be inviting.  Between the inviting pink chairs where I haven't yet had a drink, the delicious food I couldn't get enough of and an outdoor patio with fire pit that looks like a great spot for day or night, I'll be back invited or not.  And if I arrive late and they're closed, at least I can still take in the scent of the lobby.

This is a small, yet very cute place. The ice cream is good and there are plenty of novelties. It would be great if they expanded their flavor selection. Moreover, a caddy to hold your cone while shuffling through your purse for your wallet or signing your receipt would be nice.

Wow, what an amazing pizza!  I give this place five stars for the pizza, itself. The Chicken Pesto Pizza was loaded with moist chunks of chicken breast smothered in a generous portion of pesto (pictured.) The crust was thin, yet, chewy, not crusty or dry. Yum!  The two flavors of Bruschetta (pictured) were fine, but nothing to write home about. It's not to be compared to that of a few other CenPho dining spots.  The salad (pictured) had a lovely presentation, but I didn't care for it. I'm not sure if it was the greens or the dressing, but it tasted a bit bitter to me.  Unlike some other reviews I read here, i had no issue with the service.  If it weren't for the salad and bruschetta, I'd have given Humble Pie five stars!

After a couple of visits to Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery, I think I've had my fill.  On my first visit with a group of friends, we were denied food because it was too close to the kitchen's closing time or something of that nature.  Frankly, given they were new to downtown Phoenix at the time and just beginning to build a clientele, so I was a bit surprised they turned away a party of about ten people.  No worries--we found another local place perfectly willing to accommodate us.  My more recent visit was just a couple of days ago; a party of two in the afternoon hours.  At first, the server seamed quick and attentive, but after serving drinks and entrees, disappeared.  We had to wait about 30 minutes after finishing our meals to get a carryout container, then she never brought the check.  So much for the service.  The food was mediocre.  I say that because my friend enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, my I didn't care for the Danny Boy's Shepherd's Pie at all.  The mashed potatoes had the texture of cardboard and the mystery meat had no flavor of beef.  I guess the two meals averaged out to "mediocre."  Of course, the absentee server might have known that if she bothered to check back with us.  I don't ask for much --- I really don't.  I never send my food back, but is dropping $50 on two entrees and two drinks in exchange for discernible food and a server who doesn't forget you exists too much to ask for?  :::Sigh:::   Oh, and I like to be able to hear the game on tv as much as anyone else, but PLEASE turn it down a notch so I can hear the person sitting two feet away from me speak.

I can't believe I was refused a glass of water here! And on a day where the temperature was 111°, no less. If I'm not mistaken, I believe Arizona has a law forbidding this. The guy behind the counter had the nerve to tell me they don't have water there. Really? I guess I'll be taking my yogurt craving business elsewhere. It didn't wow me, anyway.

Blink and you may miss the parking lot entrance! This QT is conveniently located but finding the entrance to the parking lot is easily missed if you don't enter from the  neighboring business's lot.

Newly opened in the old Vitamin T space, this place is as fun, if not more so, then there Camelback Esplanade location, with it more brightly colored palette. Be sure to try their empanadas. They're nontraditional, but are colorful, flavorful and oh so yummy!

This newly opened QT store is clean, modern and a great addition to the neighborhood. The concept is similar to existing QT stores although the layout has been refreshed. This location features parking, not only in front of the store, but the sides as well and offers two additional entrances on each side of the building not found in most other Phoenix area locations. Inside you'll find all your favorite QT staples as well as a full-service coffee and smoothie bar. And when you're ready to sit and sip on that coffee or enjoy a snack you'll find umbrella tables and chairs out front. The Thomas Road scenery isn't much to look at but it sure is convenient to have somewhere to sit. Now if they only had free Wi-Fi. :::Sigh:::

Looks like it's open for business! A small group of bellhops were waiting outside to assist customers as I drove passed today. If only I didn't live locally.  :::sigh:::  I'd love to try this place. Is it wrong to stay here if I don't really need to? ;)

This CVS location is now open for business. It's a newly constructed building, clean and bright. There is plenty of parking, but given the intersection/SEC of 7th Street and Indian School Road, expect plenty of traffic when entering or exiting the parking lot.  It's just the nature of being in this busy area.

This T.J. Maxx location SEEMS to be smaller than some of it's sister locations. In reality, it probably has the same square footage as the others, but the floor plan is a bit different. There is a decent merchandise selection and plenty of bargains! I do like stopping in from time to time.

On opening day, I anticipated a long wait. When I arrived in the late evening, the crowd was slim but the wait was still rather long; nearly 30 minutes in line waiting to order, waiting for the staff to cook food since they already ran out and sandwich assembly.  Having said that, I was very impressed with the staff. Several of them were very apologetic about the long wait. Even the manager approached me THREE times to apologize and thank me profusely for being so patient. One of the staff members gave me a free cookie and the manager threw in a free shake. I never expected one freebie, let alone two. I couldn't even eat it all! Nonetheless, I appreciated the gestures, especially on opening day when they had worked so hard to accommodate large crowds and the staff maintained a pleasant demeanor.  Oh, and yes, the food... the Pizza Sandwich was far more flavorful (and spicy) than I expected. I'll be back to sample other menu items and more of that friendly Potbelly service! :)

Unlike some of its other patrons, my experience at Daily Dose Midtown was positive. The service was fast and friendly (though the crowd was light) and the food was reasonably good. It's a clean, comfortable, inviting place to meet friends.  Plus, at bar, the HH price is nice.

Big crowds arrived to scoop up big bargains once HomeGoods' most recent offering made its debut in Phoenix. Located in the same strip mall as sister store, TJ Maxx, this facility (once occupied by Borders) is recently remodeled, clean and attractive. You'll find all the usual suspects: kitchen, bed, bath, living and garden accessories. Bring your pick-up truck. Once you begin to meander around, you're likely to want to bring home more than what's on your shopping list!

Gigi's has focused it's efforts on only the superficial.  Their marketing materials (signage, brochures, packaging, etc.) are slick and glossy.  That's appropriate for this type of business, but what about focusing on the core if what it's supposed to do --- making great cupcakes?  And having a wide selection from which to choose?  On the Sunday afternoon I stopped in, there where six cupcakes.  Not six varieties, but six ACTUAL cupcakes!  I can understand the need to avoid waste and shrinkage, but six???  They're made of flour and water!!!  How much can it cost to keep a variety on hand?  In terms of the product, the cake was just average and the frosting was too thick and sweet.  The good news?  It was pretty to look at and well-packaged.

It's here!  The French Bee is now located along the Camelback Corridor!  If you've visited this store before, you already know how much fun it is to spend an hour getting lost among all things Parisian.  The Kierland location is now closed (the floral facility is still open in Indian School Rd.). Somehow, this seems like the perfect location for TFB; centrally located, yet an upgrade to the Indian School strip mall.  Stop in and see for yourself how you can transform your chateau and see if you can score yourself a bit of popcorn near one of the registers.  Both activities are fun --- and tres chic!

I'm so glad to see QT at this location.  It's located on 32nd St (University Dr) just off I-10.  A couple of it's neighboring competitors have slipped in terms of cleanliness and safety.  If QT can maintain  the new property in it's pristine condition, it'll be a welcome change for this area.  Oh, and the floor plan is similar to the new-ish Thomas Rd & SR 51 store.  :)

Three little letters:  OMG!  This place is CRAZY good!  Sure, you can stop in to pick up one item to satisfy your sweet tooth.  But, why would you stop at one?  The desserts here look good and taste DEVINE!  I dare you to walk in and order one item.  Your eyes will be bulging, your taste buds salivating and your credit card set back a few bucks.  But the tastes and textures are well worth suffering from an expanded waistline, clogged arteries and an extra cavity..  Don't say I didn't warn you.

This new place is worth a try.  During their Grand Opening (not sure how long that lasts) many menu items are reduced to just $6.00.  Customize your Hot Bowl, Panini, Salad or Wrap with an abundance of fresh veggie options.  The space is sparsely decorated, but lends itself to a clean, neat appearance.  The staff is friendly and the service is quick.  I'm not sure if something has changed since the time other reviewers posted, but the portion sizes were ample, not small, as others felt.  I will say I expected the Steak Hot Bowl might include Asian style noodles, but they seemed more like spaghetti.  The Chicken Panini was good, but could have used a little more flavor...maybe something as simple as a little salt.  The quality of the meats was adequate for the quick serve price point, though I'd be happy to pay a little more to kick it up a notch.  Overall, I'm happy with Fresh Millions.  A few little tweaks and this concept can go from good to great!

Looking for AJ Nails?  You won't find it. This salon is under new management and has a new name. Most of the prior employees remain, so if you have a favorite be sure to ask for him or her.  Prices are competitive and the service is very good. Even if you're looking for a basic pedicure, you won't find a better one at the $20 price point. It includes a hot stone massage and it lasts more than a mere two seconds.  You'll definitely get your money's worth here!

Fired Pie locations seem to be popping up all over the place!  It was just a matter of time before one would appear in the University area.  Like other locations, this one offers a fast casual ambience, friendly service and a clean environment.  There are a handful of suggested toppings, but plenty to build your own.  How can you go wrong when it's exactly what you like?  They are only lacking free wifi.  Nevertheless, as Arnold said, "I'll be back"!
