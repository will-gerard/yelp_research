I wasn't assked but...let me tell you... I did not anticipate pizza south of the Mason-Dixon line to taste anything like a northern east coast walk through the city.  I was pleasantly shocked to find myself licking sauce off the lips of another patron in the Fuel Stop that afternoon I went.    It was really that good.  It was "lick the lips of another patron good".  Can pizza taste any better down here? Still...don't give up on a few of the other NYC pie makers quite yet.  But I will continue to make this one of my stops everytime I am in the Queen City.

You have to love this traditional 11:00am service. I was invited and am glad I came. People are welcoming.  I really liked hearing the worship here and you will too. They are trying to purchase a huge organ and I fully support it based on the beautiful playing that is happening now with their smaller one.

So here it was Lenten season and Friday.  I was starving and in a city not like New Orleans in its available seafood fare!  What to do?  Remember that the British are  known for one food contribution....Fish and chips!  So you get on your bike and speed over to the place you've heard you can have a pastie, a sausage roll, and a steak and kidney pie on a regular footie day.  And Fish and Chips and a Strongbow Ale on a post  Mardi Gras Friday night!    And this place reeks of British wanna-bes and malt vinegar.  I think I even saw the reflection of the Queen Vic in the pool or urine out back!

Perhaps I was possessed.  Perhaps I was having a moment of Hellenic pride.  Maybe I wanted to feel like I was on the island of Chios smelling the marina and humming along with all the traditional anthems.  Perhaps I was hoping to break a few plates after toasting a wonderful plate of desperately sought out seafood in the desert.  I am not sure what it was that night I simply had to have Greek food. I had a dream is more than an ABBA greek tribute.  But here is my reality...  Having recieved awesome directions not thanks to my Garmin which placed the restuarant to the right versus the left off 19th and Camelback, but from the owner's wife, I pulled into an empty Tuesday night parking lot about an hour and a half before closing.  Perhaps this was my very first mistake but with this economy, I realized that the place might have been hurting more than my yearning for horiatiki and tzatziki.  Still, the women's voice was alluring and authentic and promising.  Enter stage left, a host.  Truly, I thought  that I was part of an elaborate prop set for what would be a Greek tragedy.  The place is certainly capable visually of transporting you to Ellada.  The place was also as barren as an off season tourist trap near Plakka.  The two other people there seemed to be regulars.  I admit that I was VERY impressed with the menu.  Again promising.  I went ahead and ordered Ktopodi traditional and kalamarakia.  Homemade bread that was made the last time the restaurant was full appeared at the table with sweet butter that was also frozen at that same time.  A wine list featuring more Greek wines than anyplace else was also promising, but I knew I would have a long drive back and well, you know me and that speeding thing on Interstate 17...I digress...  After waiting for almost 25 minutes, I got one tentacle of  what must have been the world's smallest octopus and that octopus was suffering from anorexia.  It was camoflauged in a sea of fava bean paste to give it a fuller appearance.  It was dry and not tasty.  To be more clear... imagine a child's finger being grilled and placed in front of you after being dehydrated.  Yea.  That is what it was like.  The salad was fair.Meek, but fair.  Nothing to really yelp about.  The kalamarakia were horrid.  I think they were anything but fresh as they were laden in overly fried onions and sopping in oil with the breading stripping away.  I must have been desperate for the fruit of Poseiden to be enticed in any way to put a forkfull of this stuff in my mouth.  It was the absolute worse that I have ever experienced.  Hands down.    I am certain from the many posted accolades all over the walls of the place, that the GreekFest was indeed great.  But its day has come and gone and its legendary service and cuisine is all but a page of mythology.  I was extremely disappointed.  I am only giving two stars because the server was ok and the setting and music was so authentic.  I can only beg the Marvrides to consider a return themselves to their heritage of excellence that seems now so far away.

You will leave refreshed and properly taken care of when you come to see the experts at this no nonsense nails spot. You can know that your hands and feet will be positively clean and made more healthy. I recommend that you wait for Sam to handle your pedicure if like me you are hard on your feet or have dry skin. You'll get the massage of a lifetime included with the price. A mani-pedi is about $35 ti start. If you have callouses or need additional pampering, it's still very reasonable .   This place offers waxing too if you want to shape your brows or remove evidence of testosterone !

Quick service before a movie that is yummy and has something for all taste buds ! I tried the Thai Basil Rice with chicken and it was lovely. My friends raved about their noodles and Orange Chicken. The average meal was about $8 without a drink. I actually was upset that I did not have more appetite.  Better than normal fragranced rice and the noodles were perfectly seasoned, i found myself wanting to eat a little out of everyone else's plate. Come here before a show and you really wont ever want popcorn in a movie again!

I searched hi and lo and had only been able to make good on the very lo with regards to good Chinese food in the Valley.  I am VERY picky and I rate most Chinese food places based on the thickness of the membrane of their won-ton soup and the colour of their fried rice.  Having passed my non doughy and not yellow test ( yup people, some places give you frozen dumplings versus fresh and yellow "Spanish Rice" in a Chinese restaurant), I was able to look into the quality of their other food items. When you can deliver Mei Fun Singapore style noodles perfectly seasoned with no greasy residue, I feel you deserve that illusive fifth star.   Service was pleasant and there was a lot of foot traffic for take away items.  I also note that they offered iced Thai tea with cream.  My buddy got a plate of broccoli, tofu, and a wonderful  Kun Pao sauce.  Sorry, but I think he created it himself and they make everything to order just for food snobs such as we.  Hmmmm.  I am getting hungry. I think  I will go  there now.  Wonder if I should get their pepper steak.

Really thrilled that I finally made it out to this place after over a year of knowing about it.  I really was organly blown away by what is the coolest pizza themed joint anywhere.  I love organs and it was simply fantastic to hear all the songs on this instrument housed in the skeleton of the building.  The pizza itself was just okay to me, but they have Blue Bell ice cream to make up for that!  And of course... the great promise of your favorite contemporary song being played on the organ.  Family fun, birthday fun...its organzmic!

In da jungle, Da Pita Jungle, The hummus rules the nite! Ah ooooooo.... in the jungle The pita jungle... Dolmades were also tight... heh heh! OOOOHhhh ahhhh ooooh weh dumm di di day...(repeat).  So I am singing about the Jungle because after a baptism there is nothing better than emersing your flavor buds into the BEST cilantro -lime- jalepeno hummus around!      Ok...Maybe one thing better might be having the thickest tzatziki west of Athens and yummy beef wraps.    Our group had things ranging from spicy chicken pizza, to chicken salads of various sorts ( by the way... loads of chicken on the salads!) and spanikopita.  I wanted to give full marks but I felt that the service was a bit of a miss.  We had a large party and even though we asked for more roomy accommodations which were available... we were ignored blatently as they shoved all our orders onto a small space and pretended not to hear our request to add a table twice!!    Other than that, I noted that the server paid attention to refills very well and the service was certainly prompt.  They are assertive with posting the gratuity as the actual price on the initial bill....so if you don't look closely, you will have paid the tip twice. A- weema wak, a-weema wak  on that!

Started with a wedge just to pick something simple. Theirs is really good because their blue cheese is savory blue. Their root beer is smoothe too. I believe that I may  need to re-visit the place soon so that I can really say more about this that does not just sound stereotypical. What I recall is that I loved the food and that there were some service faux pas.  So, I want to give it another go.  Yelp lovers...bear with me.  I usually do not wait so long to follow up on my reviews that I start.  But I can confirm a really good wedge.

My first time here is due to some awesome friends (Jane and Mark) who were just gafawed that I had not been to this chain delight before.  I walked into this venue with expectations of old age pensioners hanging out and chatting long hours while dining on mediocre not so seasoned food.  Initially, I did see the mature patrons but upon closer evaluation, they were trendy enough to have ornate dishes placed in front of them which hardly represented anything you'd see at any nursing home I could have imagined ending up at!  But wait...there is more.   Our hostess ( cannot remember her real name but we renamed her Ms. Arizona because I erroneously guessed that she would be from Montana)....WAS Amazing.  She was quinticentual hospitality with her bright smile, suggestive selling, and quirky wit!  I'm going back there just for that!  Now I better mention the good.  I had hummus which was not as lemony as I anticipated per the description, but if that is important to you, squeeze some fresh lemon on and you're good to go.  As luck would have it, it was suggested that we try the Austrian Beef Soup; a special menu item which may not be available everyday.  What a GREAT bowl of cream based chowder like stewish yumminess!  I could have stopped there, but well, you know... I indulge.  So I had the Positano sandwhich with the best shredded potato cheese au gratin.  It was divine!  Two perfectly prepared peppered and prime cut, plump, pieces of pleasantly positioned beef pucks on a garlic pistol bread with goat cheese and a side of tomato drizzled with basil cream dressing.  I cannot even get these words out on this page without drooling and letting you all know that I will certainly be ordering this again!  There MUST be a way that I can fit this into my diet.  UUGGGHHH!  Don't let my angst stop you from going.  Full marks from me are hard to acquire but they've done it!

A very welcoming group of parishioners ensured that I knew where to go and that I did not feel weird in their world.  I just came to get my praise on and to fellowship and hear God's Word. I am a huge fan of any church that will give me a Saturday evening option,  and trust me... I took advantage of that option. I filled out the visitor's card and got immediate calls and emails regarding upcoming events and how to get connected in this environment.  I even got a personal call from Pastor Roger Storms.  I enjoy a contemporary service with newer praise and worship stylings and this 5 pm service on Saturdays has that.  If you like the more traditional service, there is one at 8am on Sundays.  And there are a few other services to cater to the needs of many.    I have to say that I am impressed and even when this place is about 20 miles from me, I will return...and perhaps make this my new family...

Dear Bean to whom I am romancing, I really do love you and I want to fully commit to you but... you left me out in the cold on the patio and you know that if we are going to have a relationship, you will need more space to accommodate me!  Sure you can make a mean taco salad, chicken salad, lavender lemonade, and grilled cheese, but sooner or later, your beauty will fade and I will need something of substance to hold us together.  Something more than your evil pastries and breads.  Something deeper than the red velvet cake cream that I secretly devoured during a stressful lunch break.  I know that I should have written you this love letter a while ago but don't hold it against me.  You allowed others to be the first to romance you and I felt some kind of way about it, I admit.  But, you know that I would cross all kinds of swerving traffic and find you between whichever building you decided to snuggle between.  Just consider making a wee bit more room for me or being open for longer.  If you care about me, you would do it.    Admittedly, your beans are good and you look cute in all those trimmings early in the morning.  I should not be so demanding but I know you to be able to deliver so, I insist.  I do like your peeps you allow to hang out with you. They always seem so nice.  They even remember me and my likes.  I really enjoyed that you cater to my every need too and deliver all on a silver platter.  Why am I with-holding the star? I want more types of beans and tea and I have yet to see you work out a Lemon Ice Box cake.  Once that happens....I will get you that golden gem you are waiting for.   Cheers!

If you have to go and check your kidney function at least be reassured that these professionals will take good care of you and be very thorough. Admittedly, I was scared to have to deal with this check up but, truly, the doctor was understanding, willing and ready to explain everything and seemed to instill well being.

And it was a very late night when I realized that if I did not eat something, I would not be able to truly enjoy a glass of wine.  A friend of mine said... I know a place... And you know that when you hear that it is a warning to be politically correct and not hurt the feelings of the person making what inevitably turns out to be a poor choice for your needs. But I followed and found myself in a place surrounded by cowboys of all kinds.  Normally this would have excited me a lot, but none were for me at all...mostly they were for my friend.  I endured the unfairness of the situation long enough to make it through to the back of the place where there was a "set-up" out of a back window where food was being prepared on grills outside. I turned my nose up and skinned my teeth and hummed along to the country music until I began to see the products being rendered one by one out of the window.  WHAT?! I gave in....I ordered a Steak quesadilla .  I have to say that it was hot , fast, fresh, fragrant, fattened, and filling.   Not sure that it was my hunger giving the initial rating,  I returned to the venue on a not so starving circumstance night...and was again impressed.  Plus there was some two- stepping going on! Moral of the story:  Don't judge food prepared in unconventional manners before you have the chance to try them twice with a smile on your lips!

By writing this I get that I am admitting to attending this venue at least once.  Truth be told, I love to drop in this  place and hear the old true Western and cowboy music done live by performers who are passionate to keep it real and alive!  IT makes me feel like a real American.  And it puts the flavor of good times without complications in your heart.  It is an old dependable friend waiting to give you a quick drink and a song to sing a long to.  It seems to always wait with open arms to offer you reflection time or a rowdy time with a few of your friends.  And somehow,  the touristy venue attendees all seem ready to get to know you.   Pull up a seat or notice the barstool girlie legs give all their Americana to the experience.  While I would not consider eating anything here....I would boldly drink my ginger ale out of a dirty glass here..

Why were we all pretending to be on the DL as we entered an unmarked establishment where we showed IDs but under very low lighting?  Why when seated in the luscious libation lobby were we offered flights in red or white sans tickets?  Why did the six of us soon discover there was also food to be had and then quickly ordered scandulous, savory, sausages, scented with selected herbs, and sliced to sizzle? Was I trying to recover from my long journey West with a journey in time?  Why was the clientel so well mannered this night and seemingly sophisticated?  Why must I attempt to secretly make a guest appearance there as often as possible? Why do I feel so good about the need to have soooo many wines available at my fingertips and under discerning scrutiny? Finally, I do not care why.  I just care that this place exists for me. And it delivers on many levels for me. And it is fabulously ours in Scottsdale... and I am happy to have found it. I will be back...and not alone.

So soon since swerving sinisterly southwestardly to seek stimulus in this sullen economic situation, I found the syrupy soaked security of a seemingly "regulars" secret scene to engage in mutual swelling!   My eyes were bigger than my stomach as each word on the menu left me wondering if they could truly deliver something more than the average diner when it comes to omelettes and pancakes.  Then I began to see what would become my breakfast dining goal for the next few years..." an apple pancake" more beautiful than any other.  But I did not allow that evil ice cream laden morsel to sway me.  Yes, I owe it to all my Yelp fans to remain objective and focused and what?!!  Did I just eat that Dutch Pancake "soufle"?  Did I really get lemons and confection sugar like the old country?  Was it the biggest rumour ever that I finished that ( and a side of canadian bacon) all by myself in less than 20 minutes?    Disclaimer:  I might have passed this place up on the road but, thank goodness my friend Henri knew where to stop and was able to look beyond the Motel 6 that is attached to the premises.  This attempt to remain incognito did not stop the line from peeling out of the door.  Nor did the fact that there is no way to pay with a credit card or debit card!  Thank goodness there is an ATM in there.    But if you decide to look past that, and focus on the awesome family like hospitality of the staff and the scrumptousness of the wafflisciousness of  whatever dish you decide to savour, you will become a hush hush admirerer who is not trying to make it harder to get in for food on Sunday!

This review is purely about the poor service experienced at this legendary location. I went with some friends looking for a special occasion meal there after reviewing all the GREAT reviews from my fellow Yelpers .  I actually insisted on re-routing the original route of our get together in favor of trying out this venue. UNFORTUNATELY... we walked into a very dark bar and asked about the happy hour drinks only.... $4 martinis were one option.  The bartender seemed overly confident that there was no better martini to be had and that for only $1 they could update  the drink as one friend with us was requesting it.  Moments after the order was placed, about 10 minutes... our bartender went missing and a bar-maid surfaced asking for our order. We told her that we had placed a while ago with the bartender and she dismissed that and said let me just take your order.  Confused and growing thirsty the friend with the special upgraded martini re-ordered.  But now that drink went up to the normal price versus the happy hour price.  She told us  that the bartender did not tell us the right price and that this was it...  Witnesses to this were shocked.  But the barmaid would not acknowledge that this was not ok and did not even offer to chat with our missing bartender.  She simply took an attitude and even asked our friend not to argue with her about the price since it did not matter what the other person quoted.    Taken aback, our friend asked to speak with George Frasher, the owner, and she said that she was too busy to get him and it would be a while.  That was enough to get our party of five to get up and leave.  The friend of ours did return and talk with the owner ultimately just so that he was aware of what went down.    George was ready to make him a martini and was gracious but it all left a bad taste in our mouths.   That experience denied us the opportunity to have a meal that from a food quality standpoint might have been otherwise good.     I do hope that a little time can pass and the staff can handle their customer service shortcomings so that I can return and update this review.

In a rush to get from point A to point B but still enjoy a nice lager or ale... I found myself on the front porch of the "Peaks" peeking at a beverage listing and selecting a pasta dish. Really what sold me on giving the forth star was that there was a very wide array of foods for a brewery house and the chicken rolls that we got while we were waiting for our entrees.  Divine.    It was a good night in the Valley and I can never complain when I am supplied Ace Pear Ale on tap!  A secret weapon that may have pushed that extra star out of me.

So it seems that since Anthony has left, all that was New York has also flown east.  I am confounded that while staying at a local hotel that promised delivery within 30 minutes due to their relationship with the new owners, somehow the sauce was missing from my pie an hour later.  No utensils were delivered and the salad was a costly mess.  Gus would say " Potay Ksana"...

I am not a big sandwhich person at all. I need to start by saying that. But... I really am glad I stumbled accidentally upon this gem. Soup and half sandwhich for $7 is a good deal made even better if the soup can be in a bread bowl!   How to resist?  I didn't.  I got the pumpernickle and swiss and ham combo that i have revered as a child with a soup made of creamy chicken broth. Why is lunchtime so short?!

I am so glad that my friend from South Philly reminded me that I needed to put in a few good words regarding Otto's Pizza.  I really thought I had done that right after I ate my two slices of peperoni and sausage with extra oregano!  Was I dreaming about the review I was gonna write because it transported me back to Center City Philly back in the early '80s when I was a wee lass looking for lunch while loitering just off Locust and Broad?  Surely, I would recall the lovely floppiness of this pizza and all its juiciness?  And I really don't care that there is hardly anywhere to sit to eat it because I practically consumed it with my senses the moment it was handed to me over the counter!  And why am I not giving this pizza a five star rating?  Not sure...but maybe I did in my imaginary previous Yelp.    I need to comment on the salads here too.  All nice and fresh and well portioned.  I know they make other things here too but, I clearly could not get past the great slices there to have even remembered to actually Yelp.  All is reasonable and homestyle.  You will NOT be disappointed!

Anytime I can get live Greek music and saganaki and ktopothes... I am compelled to brandish many stars! The people are sweet, the patio is fortunately positioned for good people watching, and the menu has something for even your pickiest of eaters!  Come here and be transported to Ellada via Mill.

I truly have tried to allow for room for improvement at this place because honestly the woman who must own this place is as sweet as can be.  I think her sons help run it at times and they are really nice too. BUT... personality does not a good Chinese restaurant make.  After various visits over the course of a year and a half, I find it hard to offer more than 2 stars.  My last visit sealed it for me as I was ridiculed by my friend whom I had earlier convinced to partake of Lil Szechuan's offerings. I have been banned from restaurant selection within the group as a result of my attempt to find more good than not here.    One thing I get here is the brown rice.  It is not really brown rice. It is white rice made to look brown by adding soy sauce.  It is good as a house special.  One of my girlfriends always gets the mu schu and swears its the best ever...I swear that she does not eat out much!  If you like won ton soup this one is just average...just nothing special at all about it. Yesterday, my friend ordered cashew shrimp in a "delicate white sauce". "The sum of its parts are not worth more", he murmured and tried to shovel a "no thank you portion" into his mouth while politely reminding me with his eyes that I had committed an epic fail.   Banished from my throne and unable to select food options for at least a month ( my own personal hell), I must bring a few more things up that need to be addressed here.  Never have a menu where its possible that the first three items that a person may ask for are "no longer available".  I ask that you always have coffee and tea available even if it is not immediately ready.  And don't play a squeaky radio with fuzzy reception from a back room against a competing television as diners are  baffling over their other senses of sight and smell.  So sorry. I need Tott's Asian Diner back FAST!!!!

History, atmosphere,lush  vegetation, savoury smells, great wine list, best tomatoes, clearly sophisticated but not pretentious, and hospitable service...What other tricks have they got to pull to get you to eat here?  If there were a way to splice me in half so that my other me could enjoy the rest of the menu that I did not eat...I would gladly do this.  The nearby mosque beckoned praises as the chimes filled the air and emphasized the near spiritual experience eating at Tricks unveiled.

Mr Jung must get tired of seeing me show up at his establishment but it really cannot be helped.  Ever since I found it, I cannot keep myself from thinking about some of the best Orange Shrimp, Singapore Noodles, and Hong Kong Noodles anywhere!  Is it really possible that this establishment within a stones throw of Pei Wei can hold its own and then some?!  I think this place is economical, and it freshly prepares most main entrees.  I might have to round up a few more people tonight and go for dinner.  I just wish we had Mr. Jung open up something here in the Copa!  To be clear...as soon as I can have a few more carbs, they will totally be spent over a plate at Totts! Cheers!

Temporarily we are TOTTless.  Sadness prevails the Valley and all is out of order.  We eagerly await the re-opening in a new location BUT...Hurry. We have begun relying on Pei Wei to fill the void!  *Sniff* ...  UPDATE: Tott's has signed a new lease! They will be relocating to the Northwest corner of McClintock and Ray. A date for the reopening has NOT been chosen yet...but I personally cannot wait!

TOTT's aka "Talk of the Town" Asian Diner has reopened after a little hibernation forced by a silly landlord that couldn't see what he / she was losing!  The new address is 4030 W. Ray Road, Suite 1 , Chandler, AZ 85226.  It is on the northwest corner of Ray Road and McClintock...and alas, again...a Starbucks is down two doors from it.  Should I even mention the Gamestop neighbor?  All I can say is that the grand re-opening was standing room only and the food is just as delicious as we left it!  This location is a bit smaller I feel from a seating aspect, and I anticipate it will feel that way for a bit while the family gets into place and the locals discover this place so be prepared to wait a little.  But isn't no M.S.G, high quality veggies and meats, pure veggie oil only, well trimmed meats and poultry to keep the fat content low, and the general care and expertise in preparation worth the wait?    I can only now celebrate the year of the rabbit! I'm a Tott's fan for life!

What a lovely way to spend the first Saturday of the decade...sitting sipping succulent saucers of sugary non-soda sustanance while staring silently at the sills saturated in satin stained suggestions. Still stalking the scenario, suddenly it seems our shouting shook a local without solicitation to solve our sight-seeing saga!  Sensational.   And the coffee and company are good too.

So, I was missing New York City...especially that really cool farmhouse restaurant called Friend of a Farmer....anyhooo...  I was driven to this jaunt by some caring and concerned friends.  Here is the play by play experience... We pulled up and were valet parked for free.  We walked in after 8pm on a Friday on a holiday weekend and were immediately seated.  The booths are fabulously placed and private somehow.  Menus distributed it took seconds for Alison to offer us their famous white sangria which I winced a bit at because they do not have red sangria at all.  But you know I still indulged.  Then moments later a very HOT guys whose name I did not manage to get but whose profile I did capture, placed our beverages in front of us.  Clinking glasses we realized that having to save to go out instead of going out EVERY day could really be okay.  The economy a concern, we still found the place reasonably priced.  I mean, the cost of the Sangria pitcher was about $20 and that pitcher well satisfied us. Then, due to what was explained to us as having to deal with some "interesting characters", and only after one of us went to the host to solicit some attention, Alison...our missing server resurfaced.  She was apologetic and lovely.  Fearing that she might never return, we dumped all that we wanted on her at once...  The sashimi tuna, the shrimp esceviche, the mac and cheese, the rotisserie chicken, the swordfish tacos, and the soft-shell crabs were all drool-teasers listed that we simply had to try!  We even hinted early that the desert of Destruction by Chocolate and Red Velvet and Key Lime Pie might be victims and the CSI team could be tipped off that it would have been us that done it!  Not quite sure that this place would be able to pull off good drinks and excellent food, I let my eyes wander around the space that was created.  I excused myself from my friends to continue my search on foot.  I found a perfect oasis outside in the form of a delightful outdoor dining room which we had refused the offer to sit in upon arrival...clearly not knowing how wonderfully appointed this space would be.  There was a lovely fireplace, good intimate lighting, defined areas of conversation, and what appeared to be very attentive service.  I went to the ladies room and found that there was great style continued in there and the room was immaculate... really.  Returning to the table, I was greeted by the appetizers.  All was lovely.  To begin, the escheviche was perfectly marinated.  The tuna was so nice and fresh.  I really had to ask Alison where the tuna came from?  It was confirmed that the seafood is daily sent in from California and that nothing really just sits there...  This gave me hope since I am such a seafood lover and Arizona really has few waterfront opportunities.    The main dishes arrived timely and exceeded expectations.  The rotisserie chicken was so tender, seasoned without being over-done, juicy, and afloat a lovely risotto.  I can still taste it 12 hours later!  YUM. The mac and cheese was a white one but for me it was nothing special...It will please those who want a grown up mac and cheese without actually having any kick or  additional flavor to sort out.  It was a little bland but smooth and would compliment another dish that was full of flavor... I am not gonna lie.  That soft-shell crab was almost as good as being in LaCombe, Louisiana for the Blue Crab Festival!    The  swordfish tacos were adequately portioned and flavorful.  You will not go wrong with this option, especially if you plan on having room for the deserts I mentioned.  And yes, we had them.  They came with a scoop of Haagen Daaz in some cases so we just HAD to order them.  Definitely give this place a try.  It is good for double dates...I think.  Ask the table next to you when you get there...  I did.

Who is Matt? Why is his breakfast so big? Why are there lines out the door on a regular basis? Why am I able to without hesitation give this place full marks?  I took Kristy to this place one cold Fiesta Bowl morning when Jonny decided he needed to sleep in rather than entertain his guests!  Somehow, I remembered that I needed to arrive around 8am if I would get a seat and parking and not starve at the door.  We walked right in!  This intimate kitchen setting stashed in the middle of downtown nowhere really is the BIG attraction in the area.  Wholesomely good with organic everything and home grown and home made this and that, I found myself ooohing and aaaahing before even opening my mouth to sample the tea and grapefruit juice!  EVERYONE's food seem to lure me in and I actually had a VERY hard time selecting just one item that I wanted for breakfast.  The menu is not big. But my eyes were as a re-contemplated the implications of not getting one item or selecting another option over another.  I landed somehow on the omelette!  Original n'est pas? I enjoyed everything about it.  Kristy got the pancakes and coffee and is still talking about how this was the next best thing to do if  you were denied a promised road trip by a hungover friend to Sedona!

Holler out to the Eisenbergs who insisted that I try this place.  The baked chicken wings are splendid as are the chips with three dips.  It 's hard to not be shaken by the shaken lemonade. Equally hard is to know that Sangria was ever made with anything other than white wine but this one is fantasticaly representing the fact that the place is built in the middle of an orange grove.  Try the avocado pizza with the prosciutto, the Rocket Man, the Fallen Agnel, and the Gladiator! You'll not go wrong.

Talk about working with what you have and pushing the envelope! I am not a fan of the location, and I wish it were a bit more Spanish  Meditteranean in its housing.  I wish that I could just shake that image. But for all that was missing in a Spanish breeze, there was nothing lacking in the red or white SANGRIA!  Choose white before 5pm and red after 7pm.  Then, get a real tortilla...the egg and potato kind...   Try their vegan offerings. My two friends tried several items and there was not one that we did not love.  The others who shared the long benched table outback with us were also smiling as they allowed themselves to be comfortable eating and drinking with strangers.  The place next door kept playing competing music, but when i could hear the spanish guitar music, it made me very  excited about the promise of the power of tiny dishes of tantilizing tidbits tingling my tongue teasingly.    Full marks because the service was equally sensational and appropriate.  Tapas as they should be...even when they need a new  Spanish designed house to be served from.

I came seeking Vonegut and found a new world artisan "not so peasant" market with lots of chimes to fill the air, retro-games for gifting, students huddled in trendy cliques talking about how they could alter the axis of the current culinary movement, and a fond attachment to Wildflower Bread Company.  Is there then any reason to return from whence I once oogled?  Not really.  I have indeed changed hands.

As it turns out, India Palace is closed on Sundays and as a result, we googled another alternative dining venue that would provide a good Yelping opportunity...Hence this review...  Full marks MUST be given to this place since the ambiance, the service, the fare, and the wine were not in any way lacking.  With a focus on dishes named for Greek cities but presented to the rest of the world, the menu had twists on classic Mediterranean favorites.  Upon arriving, you'll pass a dessert box that may alter your initial intention to have something savoury.  I advise you to simply save room because the additional view of the multitude of worldly wines welcome wavering wanting with wonderous whites and well balanced reds.  Wow.    I had  dish named Salonika Chicken which featured a beur- blanc with orange liquor sauce....WHAT?  Yum is what.  Creative and charmingly presented, I spent about 3 hours in this place remembering how to pass a Sunday afternoon with great conversation, super delicious food, and the best of company.  Don't we rush enough in this life?  I value that there was not a hint of hurry here while our server was attentive and happy and helpful.  Others in the restaurant were also very happy and huddled in conversation that was muted by some low playing music with a non Euro theme.  If this place piped in the music of Italy, France, and Germany...I think we would truly have to add another star!  I really LOVE it here and this will be my new hide-out... Ooooopsss!  now I've told all of you!  Oh well.  Something so good should be Yelped.  I think the placwe is charming mostly and just the excuse I needed to Euro-pose...and you know that I did!

I am so very over a few of my friends who have been aware of this place but who have been hiding it from me.  I will list names at the end of this post.  But the Vig is one heck of a place to take a date for sweet potato fries and good wine!  And atmosphere...  The Vig is like so many other places that try to trend out a wine loving crowd and you will note that there is wine for days!!!! I had the Chilean Pinot Noir by the glass.  Very nice and about $13.  I want to talk though about my favorite item in the Vig...the ladies room. Ladies, you know that this matters...  Space, sanitation, and scandal!  When I went there was no shortage of any of these.  I do wonder how it all turned out for Kelsy and James... Hold on...back to the venue...  The Vig is a mature, merlot of a place with lots of air to allow it to breathe as you inhale the masterful meals and mix and mingle with new found friends.    I don't like the parking scenario at the Vig.  I parked in the large parking lot across the street but only realized that this was the official allotted space when I somehow detected a very small arrow on a traffic cone that said "Vig Parking".  You have to be kidding me. Please use the appropriate marquee to let us know where you are, Vig...  Sheree, thanks.

A to the power of two for real Brought me to here for a deal Lovely service taverna set In or out left not one regret Found tacos of white corn Fish, beef,or pork torn  What salsa heats my heart inside "More chips!" My hungry heart cried I can't believe I've been deprived hence And the ambiance made crazy sense If my restrictions did not limit my hunga' I would've downed a chimmichanga'  I could see plates full of yumminess piled high How could i show up here on a diet, why? A bit pricier than the average taqueria spot There's so much love mixed in this hot pot I need to say that a fifth star is not illusive Just wish it had drinks more inclusive I'll return not just because its on Hardy at Mitchell But because it's food speaks my name, Mitchell....  Ok... so the rhyme is corny but the experience is not. Don't miss this gem tucked away in Tempe...just don't make it hard for me to be seated!

This place was soooo good in many ways but I really held back on one star because the connectivity was a bit wanton. I felt I had to work to be treated like I belonged there commenting on the food. The lack of a sommelier is a noticeable miss also since there is an extensive wine list but nothing but up sellers pushing the most expensive options without real pairing consideration.  We found a pretty nice South African wine called Excelsior which was a less expensive cabernet sauvignon which matured in  stages.  It really went well with the all the fish with initial fruity tones of fig and a peppered wood. Sophisticated if you wait a good 30 minutes.  I got the combo trio plus one that is not on the menu but available... butterfish to die for, seared ahi ahi, teriyaki salmon, and a lovely grilled fish ( cannot remember which it was but it sat royally atop a lovely prepared potato slice).  Impeccable sauces and vegetable pairings were just the right thing to set this place apart from other fish houses.    I could not help but also try a guiness chocolate cake special.  If it sticks around, definitely try it if you want to skip the souffle.  But who skips souffle unless they've had it every day for a month?!   I have to acknowledge my servers, Ben and Erin.  They really worked hard to try to answer questions and were attentive to my needs.  My only note for improvement has to do with setting the tone initially.  There was something lacking a bit to make the experience warm from the start.  Perhaps it seemed too rehearsed and not genuine.  It was all redeemed after it seems Erin relaxed and was herself and got to really participating in our dining experience versus just serving us.  Does that make sense? In other words, by the time we were leaving I felt like she really did care that I had a good experience.  Still, it was good and I will return.

This is my place of choice for pizza in Maricopa.   I really like the service, the fresh ingredients, and the deals that they constantly offer.  They know what oregano and gravy are about.  Spend a little more and get a good quality taste of Chicago style pizza...delivered to your door with a smile.  And no after - problems with your stomach!    I especially enjoy their white pizzas!

Say what little server girl?!  You don't have oregano?!  Really?!  Wow! Please learn that one of the members of the herb trinity in Italian food is just what I needed to add to the pie with pepperoni, sausage, and olives!  Getting past the shock of no oregano ( which by the way was upon second request from another server mysteriously available), I soon discovered the reality of boneless wings which do not taste like compounded paper product in tangy sauce!  I really enjoyed these and plan on having them again really soon sans ranch sauce.  This place is economical and I thought that my order was going to be full of errors because I could not believe how inexpensive the food was.  A pleasant surprise.  I really loved this about the place.  ALSO, these guys deliver in the Maricopa area and should be giving Dominos and Pizza Hut a good run for the customers...

Recently made a quick late night visit to this place after work on Friday.  Ordered small pepperoni pizza not having eaten anything else since lunch.  I asked for oregano again and again, the agent at the front did not know what it was!   Sadly, at 5am I was virtually vomiting viciously most of the day!  Then the next day, I was drained and dragging with a major headache and the runs.  The third day I was again reduced to wondering what made me eat at a place that did not know what oregano even is!  I think the use of food service gloves and genuine health precautions may have been compromised.  I am not happy and will never ever attend this venue again... no matter how hungry!!!

Still sickening. Really. I got sick twice here. I tried this place again because other friends of mine say that they really like it.  Apparently, they are not eating at the one in Maricopa.  I should know better when they still do not know what oregano is when I ask for it.  I recently also went to a Barro's in Mesa and I had not a problem.  It was fabulous!  So maybe it is JUST this one... I am just unlucky here?

And with the will power of a drunken sailor in a port-of-call full of bevvy opportunities, I found myself docked at a table with several friends one night after church, contemplating the levels of temptation a dieter would have to endure.  Having been successful at withstaining from all fats and sugars for over 28 days upon arrival to Grimaldi's, my power to resist was waning because of the smell of dough, red gravy, and fennel implanted sausage!   Great service added to the inability to resist this illegal per diet restriction meal, and I sat muted as my 8 friends ordered a variety of pizza's for the table.  All pies are thin crust and just floppy enough to pass the aHHthentic test. HOW DID I GET OUT  OF THERE NOT HAVING TAKEN ONE BITE?! HOW CAN I DO THE YELPING COMMUNITY A SERVICE WITHOUT ACTUALLY DINING? I know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I can tell you that I was one pizza sniffing chick that night.  I smelled everything!  I believe I smelled a salad also!  It was all so fresh and delightful and the way that I would have wanted pizza outside of the Mid-Atlantic region to look and smell.  Could the taste be far off?  I can't yet know.  Blame my doctor.  But I tell you... I will be looking at Grimaldi's with desire until this darn detox is over and I WILL  update this post with my taste bud test!  STAND BY...

Clean. Doesn't smell like chemicals are everywhere. I've visited some salons where you cannot breathe. Seats for the pedicure are comfy and nice. The attendants are pleasant and they are knowledgable. I am very ticklish and they handled me with care and respect.

We need 1/2 stars on Yelp cuz I want to do a few extra points for the fact that these guys are from Northeast Philly and are proud of it.  They put it down on Mill Ave daily and they are actually worth the stop here out West.  If you know how to order, you can get the perfect replica of the masterpiece that Philly is known for and be assured that it is the genuine article. Now if that makes sense... you might be the one to sling wiz on a perfectly good sandwich deserving All White American!  I like mine with fried onions, banana peppers, mustard, mayo, and a wee bit of ketchup too!  Plus they have Tastykakes every once in a while.

Nobody told me about ordering " double double animal style" but when I caught on to what the locals were doing, I jumped right in and have not been able to do it any other way at this nifty retro keeping it simple burger house!  Nobody makes burgers look like the menu picture...EXCEPT here!  It is a point of pride!   Can we talk for a moment about the fry guy !  How strong. How swift.  How forceful the spud-splitting slices slipping salined into the vats.  Fresh cut never looked or tasted so good. How can I return to the one who has served "over xx-trillion customers"?  And does that vendor count the customers they have disserviced?  I wonder.  But not for long.  I have to be re-jeuvenated as I pass out from brain freeze sipping my FABULOUS malt. By the way...you can get 7 up on tap here!  YUP! This is a must make a meal whenever you meander near MESA or thereabouts!

I won't say that the sausages are not tasty. I just feel some kind of way about paying so much for this . Very upsetting even knowing that the cost of food in the airport is in general outrageous. I am not feeling the value.

Let me tell the story of my home away from home.  I really must say that when I come to Arizona ( and that is a lot these days), I try VERY hard to get booked here.  Before I go into my reasons why, allow me to give a special shout out to Miley and her van named "Mitch"!    Ok...Seriously... The team here are always pleasant no matter what.  They understand hospitality and I can say something about that based on my past ( trust me on this one guys...in another life, I actually taught hotel agents).  The team here is professional, efficient, unassuming, and happy to be at work.  That alone without even talking about the rooms yet, makes me give full marks...    The rooms are well appointed, clean and spacious.  I have twice run into the room attendants who have both times been attentive to safety and hygiene.  They too were pleasant.    Most rooms have a nice flatscreened television, cordless phone, small fridge, coffee acuement, and comfortable beds that are raised up at least 3 feet off the floor.    When it comes to resolution of issues, they get top marks also.  Here is an example of why I say that.  I ordered a pizza from the cafe that they have and the individual pie did not come to me fully cooked.  Without hesitation or excuses, they replaced the pie.  Unfortunately, the next one was still not fully baked.  Once again they tried unsuccessfully having used another oven and tried a different method of baking.  Once again they replaced the pie and removed the item from my bill having been graciously embarrassed that their efforts failed and I was made to wait.  They later also told me the ( unsolicited) the reason they had failed with the preparation earlier.  Ownership...accountability...graciousness...empathy... Does Peter Drucker know that he can find a wow here?  ( Footnote:  In search of Wows is a book written in the eighties about service...)  Keep up the good work here guys.  The breakfast in the morning is fresh fruits, cereals, and Tazo Tea.  OR Starburst Coffee.  Included with your room rate.

Oapa!  Yumminess Greek Style!  Ya'sou Mr. Ted!  Your insistence on being authentic pays off! You might consider staying open later for all the "out-on-towners". But it is clear that there can be no substitute for fresh lamb, fresh veggies, and greek tzatziki!   Have you considered having Tahini available?  People, I lived in Greece and think that this place really rocks the gyro!  Not to mention that the service at the counter was with a smile even for the last order of the night!

Looking for the real deal? Champagne brunch with real California champagne ? This is it! While there are no oysters to be had, you will forgive them as they opted for a wonderful crepe bar with both sweet and savory options. They use Stafford champagne for the brunch which is a very tasty traditionally fermented champagne and believe me you can taste the difference . The style is thus more French and the most discerning  will appreciate your choice . For $100 for two people including tax  this will make for any special occasion . I think this is one of my top three Sunday brunch locations in AZ...look for the list coming soon.  Enjoy!

Ok, so Marnie M, a friend and fellow Yelper has been trying to get me to try this place out for months!  I finally had her deliver to my desk a chicken swarma with hummus platter which comes with a beverage for about $6.50 ( maybe a buck more if Marnie actually delivers it for you).  I have to say that my next lunch break out of the office will have to be accompanying "the Dutchess" to see her second family over at Munchies.  I might actually have to add a final star because what I got back was beautifully seasoned chicken to a melting point on a pita with a side of garlic/yogurt sauce that was better than most tzatziki I've had.  I am hearing that they do a Philly Cheesesteak too that makes Cordeleone's have a run for their money! Wait for my update!

GImme generous goops of glorious green guacomole, oh greedy gitchy guac gal!  So, I have passed this place often enough to recognize the commotion from outside the venue, and wonder what all the hub bub was about.  Clearly popular judging by the always seemingly crowded entryway ( not to mention the small sized venue that you might not get a seat at if you arent lucky), I finally left early enough for lunch with Marnie to try this place out.  On and on about the potato taco and even you would give in to Marnie's suggestion!  Glad I did.  But here is the warning.  Get the guy to give you the guacomole.  The older gal there is a bit stingy and barely drapes the tacos with this green gravy.  Loosen up lady!  Your stuff is a bit expensive and the guac is good enough for me to complain about not getting enough!  So let it flow!  I got the carnitas as well and all was groovy.   A Chipotle Grill alternative, I feel.    I will return.  When I do, guac-gal better be generous.  :-)

Indian food is often minimized by attempts to make it less exact and somehow more palatable by other cultures.  This is at the cost often of not allowing the original beauty of the cuisine to be savoured by all. In fact, my visit to the Indian Paradise was not without some sarcasm and pessimism on my part given that so many places in the area get it wrong when it comes to this genre.   Boy, was I wrong!  Don't let the fascade of the place fool you.  When you enter, it takes a few seconds to smell the fact that you are going to have the genuine article here.  If you go at lunch time, you can experience the buffet.  I went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was perfectly poised for a sunset dining experience. ALL the food...from the nan to the lamb curry, to the tea, to the samosas to the califlower....EVERYTHING was really good.  But I have to also add that there was a certain family-like atmosphere created by the staff and the service was unassuming yet intuitive.  I found that I did not want to leave.  I just wanted to stay here and talk and snack a little.  That's kind of hard to achieve in a strip mall restaurant yet, this did not feel like that. You should go for yourself and see if I was just way too nostalgic for good Indian or whether its really worth 4 stars.

The color scheme and music representative of Jamaica is amazing. Don't look for goat and only twice a month do you find oxtail stew, but... Trust me na... Dissayah sinting a fee real! For those of you for whom patois is not your first language, please note the following... you will feel like you are very much in an authentic Jamaican environment minus the accent.  This place is cute and trendy.  I have one complaint really and that has to do with the value of the meal.  I ordered jerk chicken and literally ate a piece of chicken breast and paid about $40 when I add the sweet potato pudding and sorrell...no alcohol. Yes. That means I was sober when I paid for that bit of protein.   So, if you really want some good Jamaican knosh...make friends with some real Jamaicans, mon! I also have to say that if you turn up early...even five minutes early...they will make you sweat it out in the hot Arizona sun. I am not sure why they dont let you wait inside, but... again...now you know. Be careful to find a place that is safe to park at.  I parked behind the establishment after making sure that the space was kosher because there is a movement in the area to ticket as many people as it takes to buy a meal at Breadfruit!

So, my number one Jewish girlfriend took me to this place that she just knew would make me feel at home.  She was trying to make up for a momentary lapse in judgement about what was the most important thing to do on May Day...Anyhooo... She is now fully pardoned!  Rumbi made me miss my momma when I got a whiff of their Caribbean Chicken and Shrimp entree.   This with a side of Rumbi fries made me want to forget that I was at a strip mall in the dessert and was instead at a get-a-way somewhere between Maui and Montego Bay!  Don't ask how that is possible. Ask instead how I managed to eat the rumbi rice down to the last grain without ever mentioning curry goat.  This island fusion blend made this island gal feel like she should have had her  mom open up a franchise and add a few more menu items.  Don't get me wrong; if you wanted to be in Hawaii, you know this place had it covered.  But a little more of the Caribbean could have been represented is all that I am saying.  So to remedy that, add curry!  Add echoveiche fish and plantains!  Perhaps some carrot juice....  Either way,  who needs Jack in the Box EVER when you have this festive fast food fix frankly?

I might have come to this place sooner if it were not so close to Tott's! But I am glad I finally tried it. It is very good and I can alleviate my friends from my Pita Jungle invites !  I want to go back and try the swarm as that I kept seeing others order. I had the gyro platter and was not disappointed . I am particularly picky withy Mediterranean fare having lived in Grece. I am not sure but I think this one is more Lebanese .

Maybe this rating is a bit harsh.  It wasn't that bad.  But, I also think that we have ALL been to more authentic pubs which were more comfortable, and offered better fare than this location.  I want to give a third star, but, I cannot because it would be misleading when you consider other places that I have given a three star rating.  After three visits, here is what I will say and why I am leaving it at two...:-(  1. If you decide to be daring and offer a stilton based boule for a starter...PLEASE ADD STILTON.  It cannot be cream cheese with a few crumbs of stilton because those who really love stilton are going to be ordering it JUST for that strong odor and taste.  Don't cheat. 2.  Two of the three times I visited, you were out of rice for your curry dish.  REALLY?  Poor planning.  And, it is VERY hard for me to give marks on an Irish Pub without tasting its curry.  Sadness. 3.  Service with a smile.  Not a snarl.  And although my heavily tattooed server was pleasant with us, she really must have been having a bad night on one of my visits where she had to basically ignore a small group having a birthday because she voiced that they were too " needy".  It's their birthday!  And they were born in May.  One should anticipate some neediness. 4.  I have to give you props for the mini yorkshire puddings but technically those are not irish.  They are northern England.  Hence the name?  But they are good. 5.  Fisherman's Chowder needs to be less gelatinous and more fishy.  You don't need to have corn starch added to the broth.  Was this done to once again spread this out and save on fish?  Not sure but it was not a winner.  It was just not right. 6.  The Steak and Mushroom Crock:  just ok.  Got it twice and found it very salty.  I keep wanting to give the place another go. Here's why.  I like that there is an attempt to have live music on the weekends.  And the spirit of the Irish sing a long is alive there.  So, if we can just get some of the food items worked out and some of the people to love their jobs... it could be better.  I just know it can.  Please?

This place gets extra points because of Tim ! They got throwed rolls, strawberry storm in mason jar, and peanuts on the floor. Once in a while, you gotta hit up the roadhouse and tie one on.  Oops! I forgot to mention that the food was also delightful! I asked for a roumalade to go with the fish and chips I ordered and they did not know what I meant but they were so helpful.  Turns out that they do have it but they just call it sauce.

For your $20 do not do with it what I did and fantasize about a buffet with variety, freshness, and flavor. What I had was probably the worse buffet ever. Service was odd , seating close quarters, and the food quality lacking! All I am saying is that I would rather have chicken nuggets from McDonald's than their pseudo orange chicken which was as red as a valentine's day heart. The meat carving station was pre-loaded with dried up meat and the available bread was stale! I can honestly say that this buffet was mediocre at best and it really had little appeal to me at all. True that wine and beer are included in the price tag, but don't allow that to lure you in. I even tried to enjoy the dessert  offerings and still I failed to be pleased here. This is less than mediocre. Better to spend a little more at the Harrah's Buffet and get better quality food.

Love this sports grill!  It is everything I want from a sports grill venue.  And what is that?  Loads of televisions to view any game, good fare for the most finnicky of pallets, diverse clientel with a bit of class, and knowledgeable hosts with friendly smiles and plenty of explanations and personality.  I really find it hard to say anything bad about this place. I wish they had some on the east coast as I prefer this to the clanky Champs chain.

Lured down the slightly  hidden path next to a typical Irish dining place by the promise posed by a photo rendering the logo of Cinzano, I was certain that I would be able to have a romantic meal with origins from the mama-mia land.  I was not disappointed by anything but the missing actual bottle of Cinzano!    The service is quite personal and yet uncumbersome.  The space is plainly lit and is no bigger than a small chapel on Capri, yet it is intimate and warm.    What I loved most is that the rumour being spread by a bartender over at Amsterdams about the freshness of the food, turned out to be true and a welcome aroma to hungry souls.  The gnocci, the carbonara, the soup.  You cannot make an error ordering from their carefully chosen menu items.  But you might be amazed that freshness tastes much different than what you have become used to at the many chain Italian restaurants you somehow keep patronizing.  Chow 4 anytime.  Ciao for now.

Nothing pretentious here. Just sushi meets sashimi meets sake meets Saba meets maguro. Some of the special rolls here seem to be ambitious but it's all presented freshly and in mouth watering splendor. Try the seafood dynamite and the tootsie rolls. I personally was not ready for the chimichanga roll but when in AZ, do as the Mexicans, n'est pas? I am not hating the Saturday special now running where all simple sushi is a dollar and all other rolls and such are further discounted! Good value in general and satisfying. If you'd prefer to go Hibachi style, this is a fun place to consider. It's clean, modest, charming, and quick.

Raw oysters on a buffet should scare me in the desert. But here...they have figured it out.  I was impressed with the quality at this buffet.  And you are indeed paying for it.  But still others have diappointed. The other item outstanding for me here was the amount of  dessert options they had alongside a comprehensive buffet.  There is something here for everyone.  Even the most picky of guests could be pleased with something. Make this a treat for when you have to entertain the mother in law!

Props for having the hippest late night sushi reverse happy hour open til 2am. After a show at the US Airways Center, walk down the road and have some quality sushi with some quality staff, jamming to quality old school pop music.  This place has plenty of attitude but also food to prove that they deserve to have more attitude.  Ask for Lisa when you are here.  She is great.  I promise to take piix next time, but, what you need to know is that thee hot saki is really good for being a house serving. They also keep you hydrated and wanting more and more fish.  Their seaweed salad is very good.  I had the volcano roll which was not very hot but you can ask for more heat.  The overall menu is satisfying.   I will be back.  A little earlier next time.

A great place to pose with friends. I've been for a number of events to this venue and each time, I have to respect the great service and detail that they deliver.  Whether it is for a Hispanic celebration or a Valley Leadership event, or charitable function, this venue pulls it all off without a hitch.

I tried to give full marks to Lolo's having heard all the hype. Realize that I am coming from Louisiana and also New York City where one can obtain the namesake specialty rather easily and in variations. Instead of telling you all the cliche things that you will need to know about Lolo's, I am going to tell you why ultimately I did not "drink the kool-aid on a  5 star rating.    Better pricing is the missing star.  I found the place to be on the expensive side for what you get.  It is perhaps a part of my relationship towards this home cooking that makes me feel this way.  But please note:  Service was great...but don't plan on being in and out for a quick lunch unless to do a to go order... Also, these waffles are wonderfully flavored.  I detected a nice hint of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon.  The chicken is nicely seasoned...nothing greasy about this batch.  I will also say that if you are not used to Kool-Aid, or if you are like me and used to be able to water that thing down until the original colour had faded by simply adding batches and batches of sugar to it.... You will be in for a diabetic shock! Here's what to do: Ask for a side glass of water and then inject some of the kool-aid into the water.  My favorite is grape drink!!!    I am hoping to get back to Lolo's to try their gizzards.  I had the basics on this trip and it is really worth the return trip.  Bring your friends and go and eat late there on Friday night!

Stop! In the name of all  island BBQs... I dared to stop by with a friend after spotting all the updates happening to this renovated showroom.  I will give 4 marks to the design aesthetic.   Lured in by the many tiki mugs on display which are show only, I was thrilled to see a menu containing a fusion of Hawaiian and Caribbean blends of culinary art.  I had a Jawaiian choice which included jonny cakes....something that I haven't had since my momma stopped making them for me!  These were a close rendition but I will not let my momma know.    I am pleased that the clientele lured to this place seems to be sophisticated and sober, something often missing in the neighborhood.

Within the newly opened Wild Horse Pass Casino lies a replica of this Scottsdale favorite.  With a menu that boasts a blend of blazing Bhudda's Delight, Broccoli and Beef, and Beijing Chicken Nachos, this place gets a "B+" rating from this Evil Jungle Princess!   I am still beaming from the bowl of broth bequeathed "Tom Kha Gai" and my lemon basted and battered crispy chicken leaves me breathless!  Better bet the least busy time to bask at the bar is early evening... Bye the by, the staff is very observant and attentive.

I want to be clear that I am picky about places with Asian influence as it is one of my absolute favourite kinds of foods. Long and Louie's takes the California fusion bistro concept way past the more famous rival PF Chang's! I want to say that I might be being stingy and unfair by not giving full marks but they probably deserve it. My two visits have both been satisfying.  I have to stress that I am very picky when it comes to Asianesque cuisine a it is my favourite food.  Ling and Louie put creative thought into the fusion bistro cafe concept and they indeed seem to "approach love and cooking with reckless abandon"!  I am a fan. I am probably not being fair to them by being a bit stingy with the fifth star, but... I am sure a few more visits and drunken chickens later and I can be swayed to loosen my clench.   I am a fan of their crab wonton. This classic is done tastefully and not just laden with cream cheese. You can actually identify the crab meat in them! And the sauces sweet with gingery tones. Yum. I went a ahead and also tries their signature rice dish...Uncle something... I don't remember Uncle's name but I'm crying for mercy with the blessing of this light and simply delicious offering . I'm glad they don't spoil this one by trying too many things with it: just good quality ingredients. I had a chicken and shrimp combo.

So, I hesistate to share this place with too many people in the Valley.  Yes...sometimes I don't want to watch films with all of you guys.  I want to be a little discrete and watch guily pleasure entertainment without judgement and ( for those who know me well) talking back to the screen! This convenient little venue usually is not sold out when other locations are even when I am not sure that there is another movie theatre in this direction for miles and miles.  It is clean and the people working there actually smile a lot. And tell jokes. And make good popcorn. So... I kind of go here whenever I have the choice to see a quick documentary ( nudge, nudge, wink, wink...)

Shame that it now seems that you will have to insist on defining good service for some of the agents here. The host we ordered from did not know enough to let us know that there is a price difference on the boneless wings versus the bone in wings . As a result she miss quoted our total bill. She did want to get paid before our order came out and I think that was because she realized that we did not get what we ordered! We spoke with Randon who was the manager and who easily rectified the scenario but despite his efforts, the whole experience was trying,  Also, be prepared to not receive any option of ranch or blue cheese with your wings. Apparently Pizza Hut powers that be don't feel that you need these with the wings and they will add an additional charge if you ask for this.   My pizza was ok. And when there is a ten dollar special you may be able to endure the additional entertainment in the drama of ordering.

Upon subsequent visits I have found Robbie Fox's to be consistent in several things... 1.  Sylvia, the server is amazing so ask for her to serve you.  The other servers are also nice, but Sylvia is personable, always ready with a smile and good at what she does... 2. Wren and Chris in the kitchen are putting out AMAZING food.  Not your average pub food.  I have officially tasted all things on the appetizer list and also a few of their other items and have not had a bad thing yet!  ALL is good.  I hesitate to recommend any one thing as they update the menu appropriately, but their garlic shrimp, seafood roll, and samosas are really good!!! Ugh! how can i not also recommend their salmon wrapped in philo dough and stuffed with spinach!  And what about the blue crab stuffed avocado???  YUM!  3. Are you kidding me? Michael the manager is so cool. And Robbie himself continues to lend authenticity to this super - after work location.  I really felt at home because they have introduced a "family" atmosphere there. Rachel, who works the door begins this process of transforming you from the heat of the AZ streets to the warmth of a true Irish Public House.  4.  The clientele, which I know the staff at Robbie Fox's can hardly do much about...is decidely mature, positive, cosmopolitan, and there is such good people watching here.  You might see me there a few times taking it all in!

My new favorite Karoake location. Emma the KDJ is awesome and the equipment is super! And the people who frequent the place seem serious about music and having a good time.  Don't ask me about the food. I only consumed music and liquid happiness . It may have influenced my judgement and maybe I am hence not qualified to really give an opinion.  But I I'm wrong about the Karaoke, what's the worse that could happen? You could go and being your own joyful spirit and rock it out the way you like it!  But I really enjoyed the tunes!

Delicious garlic cheese bread and toasted cheese raviolis!  Italian sodas with a souvenier glass may sound silly but I bought in because the contents were so good.  This is not pasta just thrown together in a plate for kids to be occupied and get basic nutrition.  This place is really good.  I actually think that for a spaghetti chain, they make a difference by taking extra care to present the dishes in a pleasant way and by selecting quality contents.  I am a fan of the themed space.  I sat in a trolley car and felt like a kid. To tell you what to specifically order is hard.  I had the option to make my own dish so, I can say that my meaty sauce selection was married with a penne and garlic.  You wanna talk about something good!  Right now...this is my fave spaghetti house.

This is sitting in the middle of Charlotte's Airport and it is the gem in this Queen City's crown. I was so happy to wait for my next flight with such a nice sushi option.  I really dug the ambience here with the piano being played right next to the venue.  The options were amazing but the service was STELLAR from a server named Jamie.  She did not miss a beat and I witnessed various customers openly letting her know how happy they were with her.  I also noticed that there was even one customer offering his business card to come work for his business!  I am giving this score mostly because the service was so good but also because the sushi itself was good. Go get you some!

Rich the magic man masterfully mixing the most mesmerizing manhattans, mai-tais, and mystical momentos of what will be a good evening for any manner of person.  I can only say that I only viewed the barrage of creativity displayed by all the mixologists on hand to stimulate our curiousity and to address our needs.  This place is not only offering an atmosphere that is warmed by its staff, it is offering a place that you can be guaranteed will appeal to all types of people because it is fantastically delicious! The menu is thoughtful.  No item seems misplaced and all is prepared matching seasonings with meats and veggies that are not always naturally paired.  I love the lamb meatballs with tzatziki sauce.  And who does ribs in a deep fried cherry BBQ sauce?  Where can you find a succulent lamb burger?  I mean these guys are even making their own ketchup.  You have to try the bread pudding too...don't play... it comes fondue style!    When I feel comfortable about the potential of a place to accommodate my discerning appetite, I usually ask about Cinzano and Campari.  I have often been disappointed, needless to say, by the absence of one or the other.  Rich actually one upped me.  He offered alternatively Compano Antica sweet vermouth.  I have never smelled such a great scent on a vermouth.  Wow.  I love it that we could speak the same language!  If you are looking for a traditional public house where you see the gang everyday after work, I think you'll be disappointed.  It is more of a special place to slip away with a new date, or a bunch of new friends, or to show off your town to loved ones visiting. It is special enough to add just the right flavour to Fifth Ave.  Cheers!

I want to believe that all the yogurt is fat free and sugar free...many are. All taste fabulous. I have an almost completed frequent froyo purchase card and must admit that I never put any of the many toppings on top of the yogurt! This is a hard to do as they have fresh fruit and candy and cereals and nuts and sauces!!!  The actual yogurt is quality. I have a few flavored as staple flavours for me. Lucky if you catch the sugar and fat free green apple one. I love very berry and euro tart too. If the prices were a little less, I think I'd try to eat it every day!

This place is hopping in the CLT and I'm about to tell you why! Since opening at the end of 2011 at the airport, flyers can bet in having a quality burger or salad before a long journey.  I enjoyed a greek salad option instead of a burger this time.  My friend got a turkey burger. Both were very good. I might say that the salad was the best I've had at an airport venue anywhere!!  I just cannot give 5 stars when the host forgets us and also forgets to give us eating utinsels for a long while. It was after 8pm and indeed the venue was packed but this should not mean that we go unnoticed for more than 20 minutes.  After all we were pretty noticable without being at the Burger Bar!  Really. Trust me. Believe me.

Finally, a reason to just have coffee in Maricopa without having to sit in a grocery store! Seven Cups is owned by two hard working brothers ( I spoke to Mohamed) who are keen to offer Columbian coffee in variations to make you divorce your Starbucks bride. I like to test coffee houses by how well their standard house decaf is.  This place surpasses my test. I haven't tried the crepes just yet but I am happy to report that the setting works here and the service is excellent.   The best compliment I can give is that I will return and make sure that it is more often than not, welcome to the Copa!

I was first introduced to Five Guys by some friends down in Jacksonville, FL.  I then ran into it again at the DCA airport while delayed for a flight home once and it helped me to be less crotchity towards the gate agents.  Then I realized that these Five Guys were all around me as I suddenly ran into one on Walnut Street in Philly and then another out near Lester,PA. The one on Mill Ave that recently opened echoes the same simple goodness that the others do.  Good burgers and fries.  I actually like them a little more than In and Out Burger but that could be because of my east coast bias.  I think I like most that it is like a burger you or I could make and serve with nothing too fancy.  A little pricey, I still don't mind because of the meat quality.  Mounds of fries are a signature.  I give them 4 of 5 because I do think they could do a few bargain deals on the price.

Thursday night is Ladies night and if you wear pearls and / or the colour purple, there is a treat in store for you!    Besides that bit of shameless advertising, I love Happy Hour every day and every hour menu!  I have to say, they have thought this one out. Very generous portions of seaweed salad and squid salad. I have to say that the miso is not free as it is in may place I go to, but it is very tasty and a meal in and of itself.  The sashimi is so fresh and the rolls are HUGE.  Service can be hit or miss here but mostly it is good and I have gone a lot.  You will love their version of the rainbow roll. Skip the calamari as it tends to be over done.

I don't know why there was a name change or why this place was empty when I visited during prime dinner hours. I can tell you that everything I ate was hot, fresh, appealing, and actually made me want to order another meal to go so I could experience it again at home.  This place should not be passed up.  It will become one of your favorites.   The portions are good value for the money.  The simple things are not laking focus.  My won ton soup was one of the best that i've had in the Valley.  There could be something done about the atmosphere, but if you have a group, this is a great place to bring the team to eat!

Since the place officially opened on November 15, 2012, Maricopians have been able to treck less further for cinema and some night life entertainment.  There is also bowling, lasertag, and a small arcade of family fun games.  This is a very much welcome and needed venue near the casino and hotel which have also recently undergone serious updating. The whole place actually has more of a resort place feel than it had before since the addtion of the Ultra Star Multi-tainment Center.  I want to point out specifically that they have Foos -ball here and that the tables are beautiful! I looked long and hard and without going all the way to Scottsdale, I could not find a decent Foos-Ball scenario anywhere.  There are at least 5 tables located on the adult only upper floor of the center in the Luxe bar.  The Luxe Lounge is trendy without being pretentious and is a safe and fun place to pose.  Great music and also good mooding spaces ( ask me and I will explain).  The place is new and they have had some growing pains early on with mis-prints on ticket seating, speediness of service, and also bathroom issues.  But overall, everyone in service seems nice, food quality in the venues has been good ( 4 out of 5 for me) and the theatre is clean and comfy. Keep it up!

I love this place.  Not simply Chipotle, but this one. The service is so good and it makes me feel so good to eat in there. They actually seem to care about you here.  Something not always consistent with every location of this brand.  I always get the same thing when I go and never get bored of it.  They seem to recognize me when I go there which is often on a Saturday afternoon if I am in that area.  Such friendly people.

Service when you need and want it.  That is one special thing about this new salon open in the heart of downtown Tempe.  Service is by appointment but you can have an appointment almost anytime!  You think that you have difficult hair issues or need special treatment? This Salon has expertise in European hair, African American hair types and techniques  and all will look amazing! Offering discounts to students, senior citizens, and regulars, something will be able to be worked out for you here.  I am rating a five star based on flexibility, expertise, awesome listening skills, and cleanliness.    Now let me tell you, I suffer from having dry hair that must ALWAYS be conditioned in this heat of the dessert. I don't wear weaves usually and I relax my tresses as needed. My service provider was Crystal and she handled me with care and we are working out a regiment that should help with the moisture issues I have sometimes.  I am writing this the day after a service here and my hair feels amazing and looks wonderful.  I will keep you all updated on the progress... Really...  You're gonna love that this salon offers a  lot of services at reasonable prices. They don't yet do manicures or pedicures just yet but they will soon.  They wax, offer paraphin treatments, color service and for a fraction of the price down the road off Mill. *************There is an available discount if you mention that you saw this business on YELP..... $10 off services of $40 or more and $50 off sew in weave service********. You can make appointments by calling 602.545.1007!!

"Hunan chicken is the number one seller here."  That was the beckon that was yelped at me by the manager.  It was easy enough to walk into this store front strip mall setting restuarant.  Nothing fancy but it did look clean.  And the menu on the wall had over 40 items to choose from.  And he had the fact that I really love Chinese food and that there is no place yet that i have found in a reasonable distance from Tempe Beach Park that offers a homestyle Chinese meal experience all in his favor.    I heeded the call. I got a wonton soup, eggroll, and Hunan Chicken as suggested. But OHHHH. The disappointment. To be clear.  This food knows how to take a picture.  Indeed I took several before digging in to share with you all.  Complete posing material, but not so wonderfully edible.    Sadness shook me with my first spoonful of soup.  Why did i refuse to believe the other elite member who rated this place with one star?   Why can I not resist the looks of a well disguised mutallated chicken in sauce?    I want to tell you that if you have had Chinese food just about anywhere else, you will not be pleased with this option.  No matter how sexy they can package it. Sorry.  Just don't waste your time and $10.

What an awesome addition to the PHX airport/ conveniently located in the high A gate section of terminal 4, this place covers three previous gates in space and has many of your favorite Four Peaks items.  I found the food to be as delicious as the outside locations and the service, though a little slow, was actually very friendly and hospitable.  You could see that there was indeed an effort to get it right and be speedy.  If you are going to eat here, be sure that you have at least an hour to spend.
