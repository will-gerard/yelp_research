Yum! I got the lo mein and it was delicious! The restaurant was packed, for good reason.  My only complaint was that the person I went with got her food 10 minutes before me.  I'm not sure if they forgot about my meal, or if it just took longer to make, but it was kind of weird.  Anyways, overall it was a good experience and I would come back.

This is a great little hole-in-the wall pho restaurant. I'm pretty picky about my pho, and this place hits the mark! They make an excellent broth and the service is very fast. One of my favorites!

Food was okay and service was WEIRD!! We had the most awkward server... It was embarrassing! However, the Tom yum was pretty good and so were the pumpkin and panang curries. We noticed that the rice is really sticky, probably because they used sticky rice instead of jasmine rice. Pretty strange for Thai food... But not bad with curry on top. We would come here again... but only with a groupon.

I've come here for breakfast before and haven't had a problem with food in the past.  I'm not sure what happened tonight, but I will never come here for dinner again.  My two friends and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, a tuna melt, and a soup.  Keep in mind, I NEVER send back food.  Tonight was the exception.  The soup was cold, so they brought us another one, which was fine. But both sandwiches were cold, and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The server apologized and said they would make us new sandwiches.  A few minutes later they brought out a new sandwich-- except it wasn't new! They were the same sandwiches they brought a few minutes earlier-- with our bite marks in them.  They put partially eaten food back on the grill.  Health code violation, maybe?? The server was very apologetic when we pointed it out, and although our sandwiches didn't taste bad, she said she would bring out new ones.  The tuna melt came out fine, but my grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeño was terrible!! It was mostly raw jalapeño with a little bit of cheese.  I took a few bites and gave up.  This-- coming from a girl who is almost always in the clean plate club!  The only redeeming factors tonight were are apologetic server and the bottle of wine we ordered.

If you want pho in Tempe go somewhere else! I ordered pho here and not only did it take 15 minutes to arrive--- I got the worst food poisoning I have had in years!!! I think they must have left the meat sitting out too long... Gross! Any of the pho places along Dobson are WAY better!

This place is awesome! It is hard to believe the restaurant is 100% vegan!! The food was SO delicious!  The service was also great!  We will be visiting this restaurant from now on, every time we visit Las Vegas.  We got several different dishes to share.  You can't go wrong with what you order!

This place is awesome! The food was delicious, the French fries came out hot and the service was fast and very attentive.  I split one of the yummy grilled cheese sandwiches and a salad.  It was better than I imagined!! We also loved sitting on the dog- friendly patio, overlooking South Mountain.  I'm excited that they have another sister restaurant in Tempe.  I'll definitely be back!

Debbi is a great teacher, and is extremely knowledgeable about Pilates!  I've taken several classes from her, including private mat classes, reformer classes, and barre classes, and they are all a wonderful workout.  She will modify classes for various levels-- from beginners to advanced.  Highly recommend!!
