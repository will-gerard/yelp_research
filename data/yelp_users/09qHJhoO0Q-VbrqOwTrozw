I don't get to downtown Scottsdale that often so when I go I try to hit some place new. Went here once a few months ago on the recommendation that this was the best cheesesteak around. Found it was just average and decided that maybe it was just an off day. It was slow and there was some issue with the cooks.  Found myself in Scottsdale at lunch time so I went back today at 12:10p - the height of lunch rush - the place was closed with mail on the floor. Next to the sign that says 'Open 24 Hours'. What a joke.  Avoid this if you want to get decent food and decent service.

Great pub with better than average food. Happy hours are a bargin and it seems overlooked for weekday lunch which makes it nicer for those that do go there. Check the live music they have weekend eves. New asian chicken salad on the menu was really good.

Saw this place reviewed somewhere else and had to go see for myself.  It is a little, unassuming place on the side of the Antique Mall on AZ ave. Appropriately decorated in Pittsburgh Stealer merchandise. The owners and staff have great personalities and really bring the place to life.   They had a new item that wasn't on the menu yet - The Wing Ding Willy - where hot wings meet hot dogs. On a sesame bun we find a hot link dog, bleu cheese crumbles, hot wing sauce, bacon, and some bleu cheese dressing. I was very good. One of the best hot dogs I've had. I will definitely be back to sample more of the menu.

I am a real fan of Pho and there are quite a few option in this area. I have seen this place next to LeeLee's for a while but never thought anything of it. The other night I needed something just for myself so i figured I would go in for a to-go order.  It was really quite good. Everything was fresh - especially the noodles - and the meat and broth were great tasting. One of the better places in the area. Looking forward to going back. Service was very friendly and fast  While the place had a funky smell upon entering - don't let that put you off. The food is excellent and watching them make the noodles fresh on the spot is an extra treat.

Was intrigued by the name and the rating they have. Drove by a few times but had never been in. Wished I had gone sooner.  The place is a no-nonsense, bare-bones wing shop. But they do it well. Very Well. They have 18 flavors to pick from and you can go with regular or boneless. I went with Honey-Habenaro wings and they were great. Big, meaty wings - fired up crisp under a sauce with just the right amount of kick. They do have an extreme version that i may have to try. Price was good for the food amount.  they do have a few other menu items in fried shrimp plate and some chicken sandwiches but not sure why you would want to have that instead of the amazing wings. I will definitely be back to try the ATL style and some other flavors

I was looking for something different for lunch and stumbled upon this place, hidden away a little off Mill Ave. Make a plan to go here.  Huge selection of sandwiches that can cater to anyone whether carnivore or vegetarian. The sauces are original and interesting and the house bread for the sandwiches was soft with a nice crunchy crust. Small dining area so may need to eat your sandwich somewhere else.  Only downside was they messed up the order a little and i think there should have  been more meat on my sandwich. Had the Madison Bumgarner and i thought it was a little skimpy for an $11 sandwich. Would definitely try again.
