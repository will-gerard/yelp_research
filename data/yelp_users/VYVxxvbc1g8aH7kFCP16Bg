I don't pretend to be an expert on Mexican food. But, oh man, isn't the food unnecessarily greasy here? I got a chicken burrito and the grease was dripping down my hands to my arms! Flies everywhere in March (!). . . Cannot possibly imagine coming here during the summer time. I'm from Tucson and I started to think Mexican food means something different to me. But seriously, what are you eating here in Phoenix?

I love fried chicken. I probably only visit Popeye's once a year, but every time I do, I order the biggest bucket and smell like fried chicken for the rest of the week.   My brother-in-law is coming to visit us from Spain and he specifically requests Popeye's. So consider ourselves lucky, for having a fried chicken heaven on earth.

I don't understand why it only gets a 3.5 star in general reviews because I have become a HUGE SWEET TOMATOES FAN of the Tempe location in a matter of 3 months.  Before I moved to Tempe, I knew about Sweet Tomatoes only because it was my vegan friend's shrine and she suggested a double date there one time. Well, at that time, I visualized this place as a buffet with unappetizing lettuce leafs and drippy salad dressing, like the salad bar in a university cafeteria that I never visited. Given that I was generally skeptical of my vegetarian friend's recommendation and particularly skeptical of how good soup-and-salad can possibly be, the idea of a double date there was ... kind of out of the question.  Now I have the good fortune of living really close to a Sweet Tomatoes. Now I want to go there all the time, whether it is a single, double, triple, quadruple, or quintuple dates!  Things I love about Sweet Tomatoes:  1) Seasonally changing menu. The menu features the freshest ingredients in season and the low price reflects that. Last month I experienced an Asian-inspired buffet, and this week is a potato-fest. I like surprises!  2) Amazing salads. I would have to spend 7~10 bucks on some bland, refrigerated boxed salad from places close to where I work. But why get that if I can build my own delicious salad, for almost the same price (plus other amazing goodies)? The dressing, by the way, is the reason why I don't attempt to make my own salad at home.   3) Warm, yummy cornbread and muffins. In restaurants serving good bread, I would finish a whole basket of complimentary bread before my entree. Yes, I am a carb snob and in desperate need of portion control when it comes to carbs. Here, I love the selection of mini-bite, fresh-out-of-the-oven cornbread, orange/cranberry muffins, chocolate brownies, and blueberry muffins. The are the perfect size, and give me a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.  4) Homemade soups. I love all the Sweet Tomatoe chicken soups: the clear-broth chunky chicken noodle soup, and the creamy chicken wild rice soup. I tried the curry lentil soup and I remember it made me very happy. The soup selection changes every time I go but I think the chunky chicken noodle soup is a staple.  5) Helpful, friendly staff. People are super friendly there. They would walk around and give out a plate of warm and gooey chocolate-chip cookies to tables where people almost finish with their meal. The staff not just smile to you, but also talk to you. Each food item is labeled clearly with a description of the ingredients, but apparently I can ask for recipes as well!  *A side note: the staff really care about food hygiene. I noticed one time the lady filling the salad bar had some mushrooms fell outside the tray. She didn't put them  back (even though there were literally on the verge of the salad tray) but threw them away. It is really basic, but I don't think all restaurants have trained their employees to do that.  6) Kid-friendly environment. I always lament the fact that kids don't eat their vegetables. To get them to eat veggies, you probably have to wrap a celery stick in bacon, put on a buttermilk batter, and deep fry it in butter. I think Sweet Tomatoes is helping to change our food culture. I am very proud of the kids I have seen at the Sweet Tomatoes who eat a hearty serving of vegetables before digging into the frozen yogurt!  Maybe I am writing an unnecessarily long review. But I think this place deserves more applause! True, it is not on your Micheline star guide, not the one-of-a-kind neighborhood gem, never featured on Man v. Food or Triple D, and surely not where you would call for an anniversary dinner reservation.   It is simple, fresh, lovely, inexpensive, and best of all, in moderation. This is where I would go for a weekend brunch when I don't want greasiness and excessiveness in my system.

Always a pleasant experience at sweet tomatoes. Super friendly staff. The line is a bit slow at times, but it may well be because everyone is armed with coupons!  On my lazy days, a soup and a salad to go from this place is god-sent.  I have to say the hot dish selection is not as good as it used to be, and the last time I tried the ice cream it tasted too watery for my liking. But for how little I paid, I am not complaining.

Review for its postal service only.  The smoke shop has a USPS window. It is a USPS contractor and unfortunately I found its practice seemed quite casual to me.  (1) CHARGED ME 50 CENTS MORE FOR PAYING CREDIT CARD... and the owner did not tell me the extra charge until I saw the receipt.  (2) The parcel was not stamped when I left the shop. In fact, it was placed on the chair inside the window. I didn't confront them right away because I was in a hurry. But USPS doesn't allow such practice as a matter of rule.  (3) I have paid more for postage here than at a real USPS location.   So I will try mail it elsewhere next time.

Husband is a self-proclaimed Korean BBQ addict because he had a Korean nanny growing up so he knows how to use chopsticks better than I do and always tries to recreate the childhood bulgogi recipe. BUT, he had NEVER had Korean BBQ, well, before Takamatsu.  We first visited Takamatsu in Chandler, AZ. Initially we were skeptical because the name sounds ambiguously Japanese and the menu includes a quite substantial sushi selection. But when we saw the numerous small plates of appetizers (various veggie kimchi, fish cake) that covered the table top, we started to realize this is serious business. We ordered short rib and spicy pork to grill on our table.  The portion was enormous; the marinade was heavenly; and the grilling was fun. The meal was so meaty (in a very good way) we had to box most of our grilled ribs and pork. Even the left-over was good. Husband made ramen noodles with the spicy pork.  Also, we strayed and got a side of sashimi. We ended up grilling the sashimi because 1) we were so full and 2) grilling was so much fun.  We came back the next weekend. This time in Tucson. The Tucson location is the original, so it is more upscale and spacious than the one in Chandler, and has a full-blown sushi bar. We got spicy BBQ pork and bulgogi beef. I also ordered a tofu seafood stew.  Spicy pork was outstanding; bulgogi dried up more quickly on the grill so it was not my favorite, but still good; the tofu stew was filling. Overall, we love this place.  I highly recommend venturing into the Korean BBQ land with a group of friends. It is good food, relatively inexpensive, tons of fun, and highly addicting.

Hands down the best place I've been for car repair. People at LaSueur are friendly, professional, and really knowledgeable. I have a second-hand tricked-out Mini Cooper S and we are in the process of de-modifying it to make it safer.  I don't know much about cars, and most times the mechanics didn't bother to explain to me the charges and the reason behind them (or at least they remained a mystery to us after we left the shop). So I feel an almost inherent distrust towards car shops.   A woman I met in the light rail park-and-ride garage who owns a gorgeous yellow mini recommended this place to me. We made an appointment with LaSueur to put on new wheels and balance it. My husband visited the place the day before the appointment and told me I would love this place -- he told me it feels very different.  Surely it is different, in a very good way! It's a true Mini's heaven. I don't think I have seen so many used Minis in such good conditions at a second-hand dealership.   But what really impresses me is the service I got on my baby car. The mechanics came out a number of times during the wheel change and explained to us what he would be doing every step along the way, and walked my husband through it. He also came out and asked for approval of an additional charge when he found out some beam must be replaced. In the end, we were given a diagram that compared how the car was balanced before and after. I've surely never seen this much data on my car anywhere else!  The car drives so much more smoothly after the balance and the new wheel. The balancing is only $75 (and they didn't charge me for putting on the wheels). I feel it is a seriously honest place where I can trust my car in good hands. My husband is thinking of bringing his VW R32 here from Tucson for balancing too.  LaSueur has won me over! We would do more work on my mini, and this would be the place for me to go!

Food is cheap and flavorful. I'm a huge fan of its coconut soup and green curry. When I lived in Tempe, the only time I ordered a takeout was from there. We enjoyed the food, and thought Thai food went well with the season finale of Game of Thrones. While we may not want to revisit the scene of the red wedding, we would order food from Thai Basil over and over again. My inlaws also like the food from here! You can select the spicy level, and a medium is tingling but not firey. A great place in the college town.

I've always enjoyed my trips to TJ's. The fearless flyer, the seasonal products, the whimsical packaging, and the typical TJ's sense of ease and humor always put me in a good place after a long day at work. I've developed a habit of picking up a few items that I couldn't even imagine would exist to try at home. Sometimes I was underwhelmed, other times, I was seriously wowed. Among my TJs favorites are: mini dark chocolate bars, soft-baked snicker doodles, frozen Indian entrees, triple ginger cookies, whole wheat naan bread, frozen macaroons, soy milk, multigrain crackers, juices, and various beauty products (!).   TJ never fails to put a smile on my face. I'm starting to follow the blog "What's Good at Trader Joe's?" and sending friends care packages of TJ's products. There's a lot of myth surrounding where are TJ's sources from. I'm not that much of a source police, but I rarely find products there with a long, complicated, and undecipherable list of ingredients that kept me on my toes. When the husband starts to make some dietary changes (go gluten-free and veggie-rich), we have found TJ's a good place to start because healthy food here doesn't taste gruesome and overly wholesome. With TJ's fantastic selection of healthy delicious choices, I've grown to experiment with bolder concepts and simpler ingredients. Gotta love my TJ's in my neighborhood!

THE SAME BAD THING HAPPENED TO ME!!! Driver completely forgot about picking us up at Luxor to catch our flight. We almost missed our flight because the driver's MIA. He refused to pick up the phone and lied to the operator that we were not there, whereas in fact we waited for more than an hour for him. When I confronted the driver later (whose phone number I happened to have because he misdialed me earlier for confusing my itinerary with another passenger!!!), he had to admit that he forgot about us totally and hanged up abruptly for "in the middle of driving." When I tried to get a refund at the ticket sales booth, the lady there was so aggressive that she actually walked out of the booth trying to hit me. Trying to get hold of the accounting office to get a refund was equally frustrating. I mean, I was already almost missing my flight and just want my money back, and they have made it impossibly hard.  All the 1 star reviewers (which should be 0 star anyway) share the experience that Ritz shuttle service is UNRELIABLE and stood the passenger up. Urrr...

Second time here. No reservation for Sat brunch. Surprised by no wait or line compared to the huge crowd in front of Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse next door.   Wonderful meal. Everyone's happy. Including my Chinese-food-only daddy.  Lunch menu is reasonably priced and super flavorful. Pleasantly surprised by the chicken skewer. Mesa burger, pork sandwich, swordfish sandwich, and shrimp taco are all yum. Even complimentary bread basket is really good.  Bobby Flay is legit.

I made a last-minute reservation for Black Friday dinner with the family based on the yelp reviews. It was a nice short drive from the Scottsdale Fashion Square. This place made me want to go to Italy! What a great place to eat and rest, especially after a long day of deals and sales!  -Decor: Homey bistro-style interior. -Food: Pasta was really really good. We got calamari pasta (Tagliatelle Con Calamari), ear pasta with sausage and rapini (Orecchiette Salsiccia E Broccolini), Cornish hen (Galletto Alla Rustica), prosciutto pasta (Tagliatelle Tiroles), lasagna, and pork chop. I only tried the pasta dishes, and they were all heavenly delicious. I still have dreams about the spicy tomato sauce in the calamari pasta and the olive oil sauce in the sausage rapini pasta.  -Service: very attentive. Got my glass of water no ice filled incessantly throughout the meal.  I don't think I want every day to be a Black Friday, but I want every day to be a good pasta day in Veneto. I've never been so impressed with pasta! Will be back.

Before I found out "Cibo" means "food" in Italian, I thought it was a Mexican restaurant, deceived by its extraordinarily cute exterior.   Cibo is, on the most part, a pizza place. The parking lot is full of very nice BMWs and Audis. So it must have done something right.  The pizzas at Cibo remind me a lot of those at La Grande Orange: gourmet toppings, thin sourdough crust, and fragrant cheese. We ordered three pizzas for the table, all tasted great, except that... they were awfully similar.   Granted, I probably shouldn't expect too much of a variety when we were having pizzas (for a birthday celebration), but I was hoping for something life-changing, like the slice of pizza I had in Rome. Well, Cibo is no food hauled from Rome for sure, but it is nonetheless a good place to chill and get solid food in central Phoenix.

Every time I go to Phoenix, I stop at this place. Like everyone else, I first learned about Chino Bandido thanks to Guy Fieri. But spoiled by wonderfully flavorful ethnic food that I was brought up with, I am hard to please. In fact, I think some of my yelp reviews might have angered the restaurant owners for not giving them the same raving reviews they expect (or wish for). But this is a place for us to be honest, and view the food scene with a critical eye.  I am Chinese, but I think so many fake Chinese restaurants have butchered the food and dump in tons of sugar, batter, and mystery oil to increase the appeal. So I was naturally skeptical when I walked in this place right before closing with my Mexican-food-loving fiance. He said the Mexican-Chinese combo could be the answer to our food love affair.  And man, this love affair is going to be long! I think Chino Bandido is really clever. It does several things really well. Their carnitas: divine. Their beans: heavenly smooth. Their jerk fried rice: I have never seen this combination but it works. Their emerald chicken: I get it every time. Their jade red chicken: the other person gets it every time. The snickerdoodle/volcano: some of the best desserts I've ever had in a restaurant-and they are free.  During my countless times there, I found there was sometimes inconsistency of quality in the chicken dishes. Sometimes the chicken was fresh, but other times it could be quite old, dried up, and left a funny after-taste in the mouth.  Regardless, I think it is a fun place with a character. With less then 10 bucks, I can happily stuff my face and then look forward to heating up the left-over for my next meal. I even asked for Chino Bandido's catering menu, hoping I can have them cater my wedding. Too bad I live in Tucson!  Frankly, I don't have too high a standard when it comes to dining out. But unfortunately, so many restaurants have failed my standard miserably. Chino Bandido is an unlikely place for my liking. It sits unassumingly in the corner, and boasts no specular interior design. It has no seasonal specials, and does not give out groupon promotions. But something there works for me and keeps bringing me back.   It takes care of its food, really well.

You gonna check out the Chino "flavor town," pork burrito is "dynamite," the combo platter is seriously THE "bad boy," and the cookies -- "oh my!" This place is everything Guy Fieri said it is and more. My favorite comfort food in Phoenix.

I am pleasantly surprised by the quality of Sushi Ken's raw fish.  My husband and I judge whether we will re-visit a Japanese restaurant by the quality of its sashimi. Sashimi is usually the first thing we order in a Japanese restaurant, and sadly, it also often ends up being the last thing we had in most Japanese restaurants. Although sometimes we have to put up with skimpy pieces, rough uneven cuts, and fishy aftertaste, the husband and I are in our unwavering quest for the sashimi we want to come back for.  Then we found Sushi Ken, with its beautiful, thick-cut sashimi, thawed to a soft, buttery texture, and no fishy taste. Plus, reasonable price too.   Because I have a soft spot for ramen noodles, I also ordered the combo of Tonkatsu noodle and beef curry for $11. The ramen is okey, probably not good enough for people from NYC or CA who are pampered by good Japanese restaurants. To me, it is satisfying because it is comfort food. I am forgiving as long as I can have one when I need one.   The beef curry is quite generous in portion given it's like 3 bucks extra in addition to the ramen if you get them in combo. Again, it is not outstanding, but good enough for me.  I think service was great during the time we were there. Most servers were Japanese and were very friendly. The menu has a large selection of food. To us, they did one thing, and the most important thing right--sashimi. We will be back, soon.

Sashimi is as outstanding as I remembered. The ramen and appetizer combo for $12 is a steal and leaves plenty for my lunch box. Got the junmai saki at the happy hour with a plate of gyoza. Nice and quiet on Wed dinner time. Love love the sushi chefs who always do an amazing job slicing those beautiful fishes!

Chompie's is a busy busy place. A 20-minute wait for table is not unusual. Although it is not my favorite New York deli (outside NYC of course), it is not too far off. Food is generous in portion, and tastes homemade. Everyone can find something they like from the very large menu selections. The baked goods are stacked near the entrance, and you can get old bagels for cheap. The dessert counter has some inviting items, like cannolis, but those are very pricey. Overall, if I want a hearty brunch with friends and don't mind the wait, Chompie's is on my list.

I am always quite paranoid about getting a cab to the airport after an episode of 30-minute delay (from a cab company I will not name here, but will never utilize its service again).   I decided to try my luck with VIP. I downloaded the App TaxiMagic, called VIP Taxi multiple times to make sure, and prayed a little before I went to bed.  Then, my cab arrived at 3:40 AM, 5 minutes earlier than scheduled. Driver was courteous and the car was clean. Needless to say, I was very happy with its punctuality!

I am a bit biased against Mexican food, as I am not a fan for greasy/cheesy food. I have had some horrendous experience with a lard-dripping chicken burrito before in a place-shall-not-be-named. But as a general preference, I like my Mexican food "light."  For lunch, this place is just madly busy. I was just 5 minute late and there were 20 people between me and the rest of the party. The chicken taco I got was light -- a good thing! Friends loved the bean and cheese burrito, and the bean is white bean -- another good thing! Overall, cute place, good food.

Some people love going to the coffee shop to relax (i.e. the mob at Starbucks).  I love going to Tempe Public Library to rewind.  It is bright, clean, and reasonably quiet. It has amazing book/magazine collections, lots of family-friendly programs, and helpful staff members.  The Connections Cafe inside serves really good scones. There is a $5 minimum for credit cards I think.  Although there was at one point in 2013 some technical problem with renewing books online and as a result I was wrongfully charged late fees for a couple times, I think for the most part Tempe Public Library a true blessing to the community here and offers wonderful resources.

The owner was very friendly and talkative. She asked me whether we learned about this place through yelp. Yeah she knew the answer.  We ordered pierogi and chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, with mushroom sauce, various side salads, and a plate of pan-friend thyme potato.   I knew nothing about pierogi and it tastes very much like Chinese dumplings to me -- but with a cheesy potatoey filling. So I took my husband words for it -- "great."   The chicken schnitzel cordon bleu actually reminded me of the KFC double down sandwich (http://www.kfc.com/doubledown/). No offense but I actually enjoyed KFC tremendously as a kid. The concept of Beaver Choice's chicken cordon bleu was quite similar to a double-down: breaded chicken steak with ham and cheese in the middle. It tastes good, slightly on the saltier side.  The side salads were refreshingly clean. I was quite impressed by the cole slaw because in my mind, cole slaw should be simple, not a greyish goo with mayo mixed in. Husband liked the tomato basil salad. The pan fried tomato was tasty too.  A couple notes:  1) It is moving to a new location in Mesa. Good for business I guess, but sad for me because I live right around the corner.  2) Menu is quite extensive. We definitely want to come back and try a couple more things. They know what they are doing. In fact, the background sound to our dining experience was the constant pounding of the meat from the kitchen. I surely didn't mind hearing that they made things fresh on the spot.  3) Food was surely tasty. The current location was small but very clean and bright (almost has a well-lit fast-food restaurant feel to it). It can get busy, thus crowded, very fast.  4) The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the price was a bit higher than I expected. I'm not saying I don't want to spend money on good food. I'm just saying we got another meal after this that night and we are not some serious big eaters.

Pretzel bread is buttery and fluffy. But that's probably it. Everything else is mediocre.  Slow service. Plain food. Lunch menu is small and uninteresting. But VERY busy for some reason around noon.  So make reservation and you can get yourself a spot among the Very Important-looking People.   But I don't get the hype.

My husband is really inflexible, so I wanted to have him learn some easy yoga poses. SoY has an intro class open to the public on Saturday morning called Sun Salutation, so we went to that class a couple times (now SoY caps free attendance at 3 classes). Although it does not "transform" your body, it teaches some basic breathing techniques, meditation, and yoga poses. I also went to a student-taught class one time, which I quite enjoyed.   I am always impressed by SoY's beautiful facility and feel instantly peaceful whenever I walk inside. SoY does a terrific job promoting and teaching yoga as a way of life and offers opportunities for people to explore before seriously committing to a membership. The class sizes are also quite small from what I have seen, and I have never felt it is trying hard to sell spots and cram people inside the classroom.   Too bad I no longer live in Tempe. Among the things I miss about Tempe, SoY is one of them.

Outstanding fish. On the more expensive side. Small menu. Good for happy hour but portion is a bit unsubstantial for a meal. Owners are Japanese. I stand by the quality of its food.

Breakfast is and has always been a big deal to me. The thought of a good breakfast makes me fall asleep happily and wake up feeling like a better person. Maybe 5 years ago, my dream was to open a breakfast shop, selling only simple breakfast food that I love to eat. I grew out of this dream when I became older and increasingly disillusioned by the "all-day breakfast": syrup-drenched pancakes, rock-hard bacon, or kitchen-sink omelette.   Then I came to Pesto Prima and realized someone has been carrying on my dream somewhere in this world. It has a small breakfast menu, with simple things as toast and smear and breakfast sandwich. How difficult can that be?   Yes, it is very hard to be deceptively simple. Bravo, Pesto Prima.

I love its Sunday buffet. It's not a skimpy buffet, and not on the cheap end (~$13/person for Sunday lunch). It has great food and tons of flavor. Meat lovers would get their money's worth there. The variety of fruits and desserts can easily satisfy anyone's sweet tooth (fair warning, Indian desserts are really really sugary). It's a great place to get a little "kick" in your taste buds.  During my last visit, I spotted Mango ice cream and Mango juice, which made me tremendously happy. That being said, I think the quality has gone down a bit. Namely the chicken/lamb curry dishes have more bones mixed in and less meat on the bone.  I am not a connoisseur of authentic Indian food. But the presence of lots of Indian families there offers a sign of assurance. I like this place and hope it can maintain its quality.

MOM is such a FABULOUS idea. I like to eat lots of veggies with my family, put my juicer to good use, and do good, all at the same time. For $10 donation, MOM helps me accomplish all the above.  My Chinese parents are huge consumers of fresh vegetables. They were so fascinated by the concept of MOM that we went to 3 locations during their 1-month stay, even though the choices were pretty much the same. The quality of the veggies, however, can vary greatly from week to week. One week, our veggies were overripe and borderlined going bad, but we handled them by cutting off the bad parts and freezing them immediately afterwards. But this Saturday, we got beautiful, perfectly fresh veggies: organic English cucumber, red and yellow peppers, squash, tomatoes, eggplants, and grapefruits. The veggies are so beautiful and I can give them out to our friends as gifts.   Thank you MOM for teaching us how NOT to waste.
