I love this place! The food is healthy, fresh, reasonably priced, and DELICIOUS. This place gets busy but they have a large community table for those dinning solo or with a friend. I went on a busy Sunday morning and was in and out in 30 minutes because of the community table. Waitress was friendly and helpful too! Also, the fresh juices are so refreshing and hydrating. My favorite item is the avocado toast, I could eat it everyday.

My burger tasted like a wet dog smells. The french fries came in a shopping cart.

I ordered delivery after a long day on campus and it cost $13 for a gyro, fries and a soda. I normally don't mind paying the extra cash for a delicious meal but the fries were room temperature by the time I got them and the gyro was just okay. This meal was not worth the money. I will not be returning to this place.

The food is so fresh and flavorful! I enjoyed everything that I ate which included: a salad, a glass of wine, and the Alfonso pizza. My friend and I even got a complimentary dessert and shots on the house. Nothing better then that!!!
