Let Me start by saying I am a sushi virgin, and many will say I still am. This is the only place I have ever had sushi. I did have a seared Ahi tuna at Scoma's in San Fran does that count? Moving on... Does it count if it's cooked?? I am told no. Anyway I loved 95% of what I ate here. Now we had a Philly roll, Spider roll, Tiger Eye roll, Texan (SPICY), and then eel and octopus. Everyone but me liked the eel and octopus. I couldn't get past the texture. But the other stuff was great with a little Wasabi yummy!  This is a little dive in a strip mall but it is clean and the staff is very friendly, funny and helpful.   Guess it's good enough for a Sushi virgin. Hard core sushi lovers may want to smack me.

The BBQ pork is fantastic but here's their best kept secret ....   CATFISH YUM!   This location serves Catfish fillets on Thursday and Friday. I wish it was everyday! They use a deliciously seasoned cornmeal NO flour! It is light and crisp and my fav! It is served with a great hot sauce and sweet moist dinner rolls. Fries and Cow-bro beans go great but you have your choice of sides. If you love a good catfish in cornmeal, I dare you to find any better in this town without making it yourself. I give Honey Bears 10 stars for their catfish **********. I grew up in the Midwest and we had catfish almost every Friday and this tastes just like home.   Trust you will not regret this fish!

I will give this Applebees location a 5 star and here's why. I used to work here and know the cooks and staff. I have inside information on how this location does things in relationship to other locations I had filled in at.   This location has better cooks and better management than some of the other locations. It shows in the food. Very seldom do I eat at this location and get a bad meal.   Best nights to go Friday or Saturday after 4pm. The best cooks are working then, these guys have been at this location for over 8 years and they know what they are doing.

Can you say discrimination? Why has Oregano's eluded the west valley??? We eat pizza too! I am a little miffed that you cannot find a good pie on the west-side.   Peter bluck piper, pizza slut, domino no's, Pucky Johns and a string of mom and pops that make Tombstone look gourmet! Streets of New York used to be a good pie but they are slipping bad! We do have La Piazza Forno which is delish but they are hard to get into.   Why I like the Oregano, I first came here on a blind date. Message, no matter how many times your friend says he would be perfect for you slap her face and run away! The best thing about this guy was that he suggested Oregano's for a Saturday lunch. I had never partaken in the deliciousness of Oregano's.   He ordered basket of fries, UFOs (no longer on the menu), & a pepperoni pizza. Big guy this was appetizers! I tried the fries they were tasty, the UFOs I fell in love cheese stuffed artichokes dipped in batter and deep fried oh yeah baby! Sadly I must morn their departure. Then the pie yummy and I just love the square cut reminds me of home. Illinois!   I had ordered the baked ziti one of my favs and now I don't recall his food order It was another kind of pasta. Let me just tell you the ziti was colossal! Humongous! I barely at a 4th of it, I see a doggy bag in my future. Not iron jaws geezus he ate a basket of fries, half a basket of UFO's and 3/4 of a Med Pepperoni pizza plus all of his pasta and the bread bowl!   I was scared to get close I thought he might eat me! I love the Iced tea to it is china mist passion fruit and it's fantastic.  I will definitely be back, On a side bar I never order the deep dish on a dine in. The deep dish Stuffed One-O is fabulous, call ahead and get it togo. I usually call about 1 and a half hours before I want it and get it hot and delicious!

Well let me just say I did not go here on my own. Dear sister raved and raved about it until I agreed to go with her. I will break it down like this, I thought there was to much on the menu yet nothing caught my eye maybe I just wasn't in the mood to have so many choices.   1. Our server was an ass! There was no one in the place yet he waited on us like they were full to capacity and he was the only server. He couldn't have been less concerned about serving us.   2. The tempura we ordered was very blah, nothing to write home about.   3. My sister went on and on about how good her dish was. Mine was way to spicy I asked for mild. So the manager offered to change it to something else. I ordered pad Thai no tofu again mild. How can you go wrong with Pad Thai. You can it was a glutenous mess. The noodles were so over cooked it was disgusting.   4. The decor was cute. That's the only good thing I can say.   I have not been back. My sister has but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth literally. You get 2 stars one for decor and one because my sister likes it.

For the love of god and all that is holy this is a feast! So one of my fellow yelpers recommended Scott's and today I was searching for somewhere to eat. Hmmm I decided on Scott's after looking at the pics. I thought holy cow that looks fantastic!   Beware objects are larger than they appear in the pictures! I ordered the Philly with fries. This samich was very good, the steak was tender and juicy the veggies grilled just right and the roll was perfection. I had to take away one star. Sorry Scott fans. The fries were under cooked. They are fat fries and need a little TLC mine were still very firm in the middle.   The portion is ginormous! I couldn't finish a 4th of it! This will be a splitter next time for sure!   I will be back soon!

I am surprised at the 3 star reviews. I have always had great food and great service here. I love the pot roast, it is served topped with fried onions YUM! I think the prices fall in line with the quality and the portions. I'm not sure where the Luby comment came from unless he is 18 or even younger. The crowd whenever I have eaten there has been a wide variety but usually a high concentration in the 26 or so to 40 range. This little gem doesn't disappoint. Good eats and good prices.

This place was recommended by a soon to be non-friend.   Portions were small, prices were big, taste was average, server was uninterested borderline annoyed, nothing to write home about. I won't be back. Nuf said!

Really? Seriously? Sarah L. is the L for Little Pompous? Where is your hood, North Snottsdale? Unbelievable. How can you review a restaurant you didn't even eat at??? from your review you just walked in had a beer, peered down your nose and left.   This is a great little spot tucked away unsuspectingly on Camelback road. They have a great happy hour, pool tables and a surprisingly great menu. I haven't been here in awhile because of the economy the way that it is. But they did have off track betting as well . Not sure if they still do.  The service is good the people are fun and friendly. I like bar food but you can get so much more here.   Some of my Fav's  The herb crusted beef tenderloin is outstanding great cut of meat cooked to perfection.  The Mediterranean stuffed chicken stuffed with artichokes, black olives and feta with a dill sauce and wild rice it is delish!  I am not a big fan of Pesto but their Penne pesto cream is yummy.  Also try the Thai Chicken skewers, Artichoke Croquettes, Louisiana Shrimp, or the Cracked Black pepper Calamari!   This is a restaurant/bar! It's a joint, a neighborhood hang out.   I hate to be rude but geez, you stick to your hood and I'll stick to mine. When you offer a review in the future you should start by saying I rarely go anywhere that doesn't require a 20.00 cover and has a coat check.

Really?! Who else finds it incredibly tacky that they added "As seen on food network" on their sign?   Me thinks that a visit from Guy has made your head big. I enjoyed the food here before Guy visited.   Now the service is rude, the prices are sky high and the food quality is down. I have given them the benefit of the doubt and eaten here a couple of times after the Guy visit. Every time it has gotten worse. I would much rather go to La Piazza Al Forno.   The meatballs were small and tasteless, the sauce was very sweet. The lasagna used to be really good here but the last 3 times it has gotten smaller and costs more and the flavor is disappearing with the portion size. Overall to pricey for what you get.   Again that sign is just plain old tacky and is enough of a reason to make me go elsewhere. In my opinion a stupid move. Maybe Gordon Ramsey should visit and give Giuseppe a much needed reality check!

Going down hill fast and signs of stopping! Sorry I have not reviewed this joint sooner. I have been going to Deemo's since they first opened at the Esplanade. The food and the service used to be fantastic! The Portabello mushroom burger was my fav! Now they can't get nothin right.   The last time I had the burger it was different they swear its the same meat and everything but my taste buds don't lie. This burger was awful, maybe even freezer burnt. The huge mushroom was the best part.   I tried the Philly cheese recently and um I really to prefer to have meat on my sandwich! This was the sorriest Philly steak ever! Barely to bites of meat all bread and not good bread either!   Their crab cakes are awesome but the last time I got those they were under cooked and had bits of shell in them YUCK!   Today I ordered eggs over medium and crisp bacon. I got eggs over easy and under cooked precooked bacon that was so thin you could see through! All this for 6.17! Plus tax! This is bad eggs and really bad bacon! YUCK!  Don't bother dropping in here for the free app unless you go for the crab cakes and then leave. Just not what they used to be and it just keeps getting worse.  Also on a side bar the service has gone way down hill to. The servers are not very bright here at least the ones I have come across over the past couple years.

Love the 2.95 jumbo happy hour Cheese burger!  I also enjoy the Tuna melt very much, this is the only place I will eat a tuna melt. Come to think of it I have never had one before this. Now I am a fan. Butter toasted sourdough surrounds this huge pile of yummy tuna with capers and such, don't forget the cheese. It is served with huge steak fries yummy.   The lettuce wedge is a great lunch, the serve the wedge with 2 tomato wedges two slices of cucmber, real bacon bits, fried leeks and lots of blue cheese. yeah it's good. taste it and see.  The clam chowder... hmmm shut the front door it's fantastic! The lobster bisque is delish too!  Happy our food is yummy drink specials are so so.  Happy Hour Monday - Friday 3:30pm to 6:30pm and Monday - Saturday 9pm to Close. Sometimes they will close at 10pm if it is slow.

There are sandwiches and then there are SAMICHEZ. I would walk a mile for miracle mile!   I'm not sure about the entire menu mind you so my review is based off of certain Items. For instance the Straw! juicy Pastrami piled high with melted Swiss cheese and hot sauerkraut on rye bread delish. Ok I must admit I was a Pastrami virgin before the mile. So I have nothing to base the deliciousness of this pastrami against. All I can tell you is it tastes great to me.   Now I am not a virgin when it comes to there Macaroni salad and that salad came to party! It's really good!   The deserts are great to I love the pecan pie! I cannot even call it pecan pie it is PEEECAN Pie, not to sweet just right scoop of vanilla ice cream sets this off! The cheesecake is yummy and the carrot cake well it is some of the best I have tasted in awhile.   Also this little known tid bit, they serve farmer brothers coffee! Which I find to be the best of the pre-ground coffee's out there. I prefer farmer brothers over Starbucks any day.   Check out the mile and try the pastrami.   PS I gotta knish once, yea once. I don't recommend it Bluck!

Bonjour ooo la la yummeee, If you like fresh made from scratch daily french pastries this is where the magic happens! Oh they also Cater!  I have been coming here since they first opened Catherine and her husband Pierre are Tre' sweet! They always have a tasty variety and they are very good at making suggestions that will satisfy whatever it is you have a taste for.   Excusez-moi Aileen B, It is a fresh croissant house made throughout the day and it's with black forrest ham and imported cheese, at the Esplanade you got off cheap for 8.00. Starbucks has a tiny turkey and swiss for 6 bucks and it's not on homemade anything.   I eat here at least once a week, love the baguettes. They also make olive bread which is Divine! Katharine makes the best scrambled eggs! I also love the salmon sanwich (yes that's french for sandwich lol) on a baguette.   My grandparents came to visit from Illinois. I brought them here for lunch. 1st because I love it and 2nd my grandfather is from Lens, France. He loved everything he had and said the baguette reminded him of his mothers. He also enjoyed speaking a little french with Pierre and Catherine. He is a little rusty in the french department.   Au Petit Four makes me proud to be 1/4th french. Au revoir, Bon appétit!

I have never stayed at in Embassy Suites before some relatives are in from out of state and are staying here. I am very impressed by the size of the rooms and how pretty the lobby area is. I would definitely consider staying at Embassy Suites in the future and also referring out of state guess to this particular Hotel.

I have been very disappointed in Avanti's lately. I used to love it. A friend and I each got groupons to go so I thought great can't beat half off. I hadn't eaten here in years. Nothing has changed it's dark and outdated. They need a Ramsey make over for sure.   The service was good although it was very difficult to understand our waiter he had an extremely thick accent.   The Caesar salad was very good. The veal parm which is my favorite of all time was not good. The veal was rubbery and the breading soggy. The pasta was way overcooked although the sauce was good.   The Tiramisu was soggy as well. The cake at the bottom was soaking wet. Yuck  If not for the groupon I would have sent this back. But half off an overpriced meal made me think I got what I paid for.   Well we had another groupon to use so we went back. The second time the service and atmosphere the same.   Me thinks there is a microwave doing heavy duty in the back. This time I had seafood risotto BLUCK! The Risotto was undercooked and had no flavor. The seafood tasted dirty and there was grit in my shrimp. This Risotto was a disaster! My friends vegetables were mush. It was worse than the first visit.   The worst part of both visits is that the restaurant was almost empty on a Sunday evening and the food was sub par it makes no sense to me.   The long and the short of it I wont be back. Avanti's has slipped to Olive Garden level with Macaroni Grill prices! WAY OVER PRICED.

Let me start by saying yummy! Barb's did a fantastic job on my birthday cake! My sister ordered me a 4 layer magical marble cake with Grand Marnier filling and Butter cream frosting! It was sooooo moist and flavorful! In my opinion and several of my guests it was a much better tasting cake then Tammy Coe. It is less expensive as well. I also received a Red Velvet cupcake. It was the best red velvet cupcake ever!

If you are looking for great prices on great furniture go here! The selections are huge, most stores don't have even half the selection of Pruitts. All of the sales people I have worked with here are friendly and very informative not pushy!   If you are looking for nice furniture at a great price go here!

I think Daren C. and I have the same taste buds! Now that I have mine back that is.... long story.   I went to have my dogs groomed in the area and the owner of the kennel said this joint has a great breakfast.  So I love to eat and I had an hour to kill so 40th street here I come. He was right this joint has a pretty tasty Bfast. I had this skillet with Eggs, Chorizo, onions, peppers and potatoes. It was huge! It was nummy nu mmy in my tummy. The best part is.......wait for it.........they had my favorite coffee ever! Farmer Brothers! I am not a coffee drinker and don't claim to be but I will drink a pot of that Farmer Brothers it is so good! Warning do not order the sausage gravy, it is not real gravy and they just toss sausage in it YUCK! Besides the gravy and one annoying waitress. This joint is cool with me. I took one star away because they need to clean a little better. All and all good food, good price, good portions and a good start to my day! Thanks

Let me start by saying apparently I have no friends in Phoenix...... No one told me of this gem until last weekend. I have been out here for 12 years!   I am not a big fan of Mexican food, unless it is done right. Yeah I've slummed it at the Taco Bell and took a step up to the Del Taco & of course I have been to Macayo's. I have to say I am in love with Carolina's!   I had the Machaca burrito with potato or should I say Pappas! To say I am a fan is an understatement. The tortilla's are the best I've ever had delicious! The machaca (shredded beef with chile's, tomatoes, onions & spices) was perfection. Not to spicy and lots of meat they don't hold back. It's so tender and juicy the best machaca I've ever had.   OK so confession time I had one on Saturday and was back for another today and bought a half dozen tortilla's! Yum!   They are closed on Sunday and this location closes early through the week. In regards to the Ghetto reviews, it may not be your side of town but if you think this is the ghetto you obviously have never been to the ghetto.   Both times I have been here no one has bothered me or approached me. Which is more than I can say for other parts of town. Damn near every car in the lot and across the street were under 5 years old and high end. BMW, Mercedes, Navigators and so on. No one is worried about having their expensive cars there.   About the decor, this is not a zagat sit down matradee type restaurant. This is a dive, a joint, a place to get great Mexican food on the fly. Yeah the spot needs paint, soap, water and decor. But I would rather not pay for that and get my cheap delicious Machaca burrito. I have eaten there and taken it to-go. I will be back!  Also the people were not rude to me they were busy as hell and very nice. I think some of the reviewers might want to come down from their ivory towers and enjoy some good food. Plain and simple.   Carolina's is delish, I will be back and hope to see my fellow yelpers there!

Just 2 words for you Italian Beef! If you are from the midwest and miss good Italian beef sammies GO HERE NOW!   I used to go to Niro's at least twice a week when I lived in Champaign, IL. Niro's opened in an old Rally's just 2 short blocks from my house. I became friendly with the owners. About a year later told them I was moving and they wouldn't be seeing me anymore. They asked where too & I said Phoenix and they said they were opening one in Phoenix not sure where. Well I found you again Niro!   Love the Italian beef it is what I am used to from Illinois thanx!

Not sure I WILL EVER GO BACK. I thought I was going to get that groovy dive or at least diner experience. Well yelpers, there was nothing groovy about my experience.   1st to our server, sorry to have bothered you by coming in as you were coming down off your Meth high. This woman was definately an addict of some sort. After repeating our order several times and her running to the manager to ask questions, we finally got some food.   2nd the food? Is this real food or a food substitute? I ordered 2 eggs over medium, a chicken breast instead of a steak, hashbrowns and toast. The eggs were sunny side up runny yuck. the chicken was rubbery with no flavor possible microwave victim. The hashbrowns were under cooked and the toast well buttered bread was more like it.   3rd back to the server and service or lack there of. The server drops the check and then disappears for about 10 minutes. The bill was like $4.09 clearly that's not right for 2 breakfasts with beverages. So we hunt her down to let her know that she made an error & we were under charged. She snatched the reciept and says "Oh you would have loved to have this check, huh?!" She then turned and rushed to get a new receipt. No thank you nothing, RUDE! She came back dropped the new check and then disappeared for over 15 minutes. This check was charging me for 3 eggs, I got 2 eggs. Then she charged me for the steak breakfast plus an ala carte chicken breast! 15.00 later I am searching for a manager. The manager wasn't doing much better in the service department. She basically said I lied and had 3 eggs, because the toothless wonder in the kitchen said he remember cooking 3 eggs. I said did he remember that he cooked them wrong too?!   Bad bad bad!  This place looked like fun and it's closed to my house. Since they closed the village inn by me I thought this might be a good replacement. I was wrong!

I can only speak on what I know to be true. : P If you like baby back ribs then El Paso BBQ is for you! I la la la la LOVE the BB-ribs. The portion is big they are tender juicy and fall off the bone. The cream corn is delish! I am not a fan of cream corn normally, they served it to me by mistake one night I tried it and was hooked! The mashed red potatoes have the skin on too yum. I have noticed a steep decline in the popularity of this location. When I first moved out to Phoenix 1996 they usually had a wait, but now you can get right in and it seems dead. I hope business picks up for them I would hate for this location to close it's up the street from me and I order car side to go.

****Miss you Big Wong****   My beloved Big Wongs is closed, Gina has packed up all of her culinary delights and retired. While I am happy for my friend and I do consider her a friend, I am sad that this gem is closed. I have enjoyed the deliciousness of Big Wongs for over 10 years, every time I would begin my take out order Gina would say Kersin how are you, 20 minutes for dumplings. I miss my Gina!   I sooooooo miss her Walnut shrimp w/ mayonnaise :(  By far the best EVER!  Her egg rolls were so fresh and not greasy, the veggies would crunch when you bite in.  Moo Shu pork OMG  Pan fried dumplings the sauce can not be beat  Mongolian beef was sublime!   If you never ate here you never ate great Cantonese!   Peter Wongs is owned by Gina's sister. The recipes are the same with a few exceptions. The walnuts in the mayonnaise Shrimp are not the same and they are not as good.

This a little hole in the wall in a strip mall. The restaurant is a little funky dive I wouldn't dine in. The dish I get is tasty. I have only had one item and I dearly love it the Lemongrass chicken it is delicious!   I always get mine togo.

Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.  The catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty.   It's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea.   If you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only.

Well I went to try the wall and feel like I got hit with it. I did not go for the dim sum. Not a huge fan of dim sum. We went to have something on the regular menu. The restaurant is huge. It was busy the entire time we were there. Many of the patrons were Asian which in my opinion is always a very good sign when dinning in an oriental restaurant. The staff is friendly and very attentive. I think we had 5 different people serving us.   I went to try the walnut shrimp with mayonnaise. Some call it crystal shrimp others mayonnaise shrimp. One of my fellow yelpers had mentioned it was her favorite here. So I had to try it out. Well it was ok, the walnuts were odd almost praline. The shrimp seemed on the verge of being undercooked and a couple of the shrimp were not cleaned well. That just stopped me in my tracks and I couldn't finish. I guess I have been spoiled by my beloved Gina (Big Wong) her walnut shrimp with mayonnaise was incredible!   We also tried the fried rice and was not impressed here either it was very bland no flavor at all. They served a mountain of it but it just didn't have any taste to it. The egg rolls were crisp yet greasy, they were small and the inside was mush almost liquefied. My friend experienced the same problem with her dish under seasoned.   It was a little like dinning in an Asian old folk's home; you know no salt everything bland, edible just not appetizing. : ) I really wanted to like this place. I will not be back.

EW, this place stinks! Literally I don't know what the funk that smell was but it gagged me at the door. I decided to check out the buffet. It looked a mess. Most dishes were overcooked. The Mongolian BBQ had raw beef, chicken, pork and fish sitting out in what I would call a salad bar. The meat looked old and the beef was starting to turn. It wasn't even covered yuck!   I decided I did not want to spend the night in the ER having my stomach pumped so I left. This is a scary place enter at you own risk.   My taste-buds were spared the torture, I went to Famous Sam's and had some wings!

Well burger fans I finally tried Lenny's! I know they have had some mixed reviews. I like this location! Everything is cooked to order. You can watch your food being prepared, it is a very small location. I started off ordering a cheese burger and fries. But after viewing the cook preparing the burger I opted for a double with bacon! The bacon is crisp and heated on the grill yahummmm! The fries were good nothing spectacular. But that burger was tasty!   Also they offer turkey hot dogs for those of you who cannot or do not eat beef or pork. This is a nice option. My best friend cannot eat beef or pork so this is great for her.   Only downside is the have no real seating here, but get it to go and you'll be A-ok!

My mom and I went in for lunch over the weekend and tried some new items. My mother had the meat balls and I tried the Cannoli.   Bravo! Romanelli's sent my taste buds into a frenzy over the weekend! My mother makes a mean Cannoli but I had to admit Romanelli's outdid her. Also the meatballs yummo! Not quite as good as my mothers but extremely close!   The short of it is if you like cannoli you will love Romanelli's! Do your taste buds a favor and enjoy one soon!   FYI they offer catering as well. Ask for Robert he will take care of you. Fuggedaboudit!  On another note: Surd I, the I must be for Insane. They have the best authentic meats and cheese's. I have tried cannoli all over this city. I don't know what cannoli you have been eating, but you wont find better in this city! Check your taste buds.

Let me just start by saying a YUM! The burger is flame broiled juicy and seasoned just right. I like mine with crispy bacon and cheese. The cheese is gooey and melted by the delicious greasyness of it all! The fries are fat and go great with the greasy, juicy yummyness!  If you want a tasty fat juicy burger go see Lenny! They also have a drive through at this location. Perfect on my way home.

I was drug here kicking and screaming by my hair!   Imagine you are out with your "friends" It's late OK very late or maybe early around 3am ish any way.. Your drunk and starving what do you do demand Waffle house or Jack in the Box!   No such luck with this bunch, they pulled in to Village Inn. I am not a happy drunk at this point. I finally come to terms with the fact that our designated driver will not drive me elsewhere and begin to review the menu.   I decide on a patty melt with onion rings. I am whining about my choice and just generally being a belligerent drunk wanting to boycott. Then the food came and quickly I might add.   Holy rye bread drenched in butter and grilled to perfection. This was a damn good patty melt. I wanted to order another! I have been back 3 times since sober to get it and it is good. The onion rings I get with it are decent too.   That is why they have a 5 star from me the deliciousness of that little patty melt they get 4 snaps in a circle!  Damn Patty is like a monkey on my back now, Just gotta get my fix!

I ate outside the box and did not get the wings! We had the tidbit platter with fried everything and it all pretty much tasted the same no flavor. Unless you dipped in a sauce.   I also ordered the burger and it looked disgusting! Why was my burger grey? What the hell is that about? I ordered med well and this did not look anything like beef gross! I sent it back and nibbled on my dates fish which was OK nothing to write home about.   All and All it was a big disappointment, I wont be back. Date said wings were good I'll take his word for it.

The spur burger is delicious I would recommend it to anybody very fresh and definitely juicy! The fries are delicious is well. We just happened to stumble across this place while walking through Old Town with some relatives from out of state. I will be back!

Donald S. just reminded me I had not reviewed the Village Tavern yet.  Eat at your own risk, I can only tell you my experience and you do with it what you like.   I la la la loved the food here, used to dine in regularly and happy hour often until.   Dun dun dun dun, one evening my girlfriends and I rendezvous at the Tavern for a little happy hour. It was not happy and we left in well under an hour. Just after being sat in the bar area we saw the biggest freakin rat. It would have made NY proud!   We packed it in and disappeared into the night never to return. :( Sad tale for a place I loved so much. It's like breaking up with someone you still have feelings for but you know it's the right thing to do.

Even though it's a chain not all chain's are bad.   I kept being taunted by my TV one day and thought I would try the Panda. Well I like the new Bejing Beef with lo mein noodles. It is pretty tasty, quick and convenient. The egg rolls I didn't really care for. But the pepper chicken is good.   This location stays busy so food is usually fresh and hot.

Slow service!!!!! Every time I go to this location it's slow! Most times the portions are skimpy! I have noticed that a few of the hispanic workers seem to give larger portions if the customer is also Hispanic. This is an observation after dozens of visits here my son loves Panda. The food is good however service stinks!

Hung a Loon is what is should be called!   I tried this place when I bought my house I was moving, tired, and hungry an interesting little man came to the door. He was carring with him a menu to the Hing Loon. It had pretty pictures of the fabulous feast that would await. I asked about the food and was assured it was delicious.   So I proceeded to call and speak to a woman who did not understand English very well (not uncommon for a mom and pop Chinese joint). After repeating my order several times and feeling confident that she had it down.  I sat back and waited for Beef chop suey, Teriyaki chicken, an egg roll and free crab puffs the special on the menu to be delivered. 45 minutes later it arrived and smelled great. I figured since I live 1/2 a mile from this place that 45 minutes could mean they are very busy or just very slow. After tasting the food I believe it was the latter of the two.   1st both dishes were swimming in sauce almost like soup. The chop suey touted brown oyster sauce it was white and it frightened me a little. I took the first bite and could not allow my stomach to be subjected to this kind of crime. I promptly spit it into my napkin.   The teriyaki chicken was very fatty and had a funny taste it was rubbery like that of an old bird. Egg roll I think not grease stick! My favorite was crab puffs! You bite in and get a puff of air not the creamy cheese and Crab as intended for a crab puff to be.   Don't do it! For the love of god and all that is holy I beg you! Do not punish your taste buds with this garbage served in cute Togo containers!

So gotta give these guy mucho kudos. My friend and I rode our bikes up to the store for tune ups. They made some adjustments and did a great job.   Corey and Randy let us test ride some new beach cruisers. We were hooked, we had to get them. We came back and they had the colors we wanted, adjusted them to give us each the perfect fit. Our bikes came with one year free tune ups as well. We got a discount for buying more than one bike. Also they gave us each free T-shirt. They have a 60 day layaway if you need it as well. Randy is great I would recommend these guys to anyone. I will post a picture of my new 3G beach cruiser later. I feel like a little girl again with my pedal brakes.

OK I know I am going to get flack for this but here goes. Are you freaking kidding me, no tarter?!?   On the advise of Abu whose taste buds have now come into question, I tried Pete's yesterday. I trekked out in what felt like 500 degree heat to the ATM. Because Pete has not stepped into the 21st century yet!   The whole time I am thinking if they are still in business after no tarter and no debit it must be good, right? Wrong. I have been tricked, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led a stray, run a muck. Just flat out deceived!   I ordered the deluxe seafood combo 2 pieces of fish, 7 shrimp, fries and a 32 oz drink. Which by the way did not have its price listed. I figured it couldn't be to much the regular combo has 1 less piece of fish and 3 less shrimp was only 5.95. Wrong again $9.45! Again thinking this fish must be outstanding!   I get it home and it was still piping hot and smelled wonderful! Again with the trickery. I started with a french fry and it wasn't completely done in the middle yuck! I then moved onto what Pete describes as shrimp, really there was shrimp in there? I never tasted it and only saw some small specks of white and red inside the gross grease laden dough! UGH I had to spit it out. Even my dog left it and she has been known to eat her own poop!   The only reason Pete's did not rate a 1 star from me is the square fish. Yes I said square, it is a square patty just like McDonald's only it does taste better than Mickey D's. I didn't care for the red sauce on my fish. The 1st piece I ate plain and the second piece I added my own tarter sauce and it was delicious. On a sidebar some of the other fries were edible and pretty tasty.   I have yet to find a joint that can top the catfish at Honey Bears but not for lack of trying.   Moral of this story, only get the fish and chips, make sure your chips are cooked and have tarter on the ready!  Also Lain gave me this tid bit of info... "Pete the owner was murdered as he slept, they used a hammer and bashed his head in, just some trivia for you..."  Yeah they bashed his head in over that shrimp and no tarter sauce!

**** Warning danger bring a fire extinguisher!**** Can you say FREAKING HOT!  I am all for a little spice in my food but holy GEEZUS!  OK for those of you that like hot hot hot I mean burn your face off then later your BUTT! You might enjoy this plethora of torture. Me not so much! My dumb-ass sister drug me and 4 other family members that were visiting from Illinois to this fire pit of hell!  We ordered 2 pitchers of Margarita's that were more like dinking lemonade. Yuck and they were way over priced 30.00 each Kick - ass pitcher my ass.   I asked our server "how hot is the green chili"? His response to me was "it's mild". I then proceeded to order the Machaca chimichanga with green chili sauce. I love a good Machaca Chimi.   We waited for our meal sipping the lemonade AKA Margarita, munching very salty chips. Mine without salsa because one bite of that left the tip of my tongue stinging!  The food arrived it was a huge portion; I thought there is a go box in my future. I took the first bite, more dough than anything as usual with a Chimi. The second bite brought my temperature up about 10 degrees. I continued thinking I must have gotten a seed or chunk of pepper. The third bite woohoo 3 alarm fire in my mouth! After sucking back an entire glass of water and several tortilla chips. I decided it was the green Chile sauce on top and began pushing it off and away from my Chimi. I go in for the middle of the Chimi where the Machaca is and no sauce. Hells bells are you kidding me that bite was the hottest of them all like I had found the scotch bonnet surprise!!!!!!!!!   I surrender! I cannot continue with the taste bud massacre. I think I am scarred for life. At this point my lips are burning, I am sweating, and I am devouring a bowl of chips trying to put out the inferno raging inside my mouth. My poor cousins are experiencing the same type of hell. All except for my cousin Jenny who has no tolerance for heat and got the most expensive cheese crisp in Phoenix 6.95. Its cheese and a tortilla people!   I stopped the server and said there is no possible way I can eat this it is entirely too hot. Is there anything on the menu other than the cheese crisp that is not hot? He brought me the menu; I found a garlic shrimp dish and ok sounds good for 13.95 I got 5 very large shrimp covered in melted cheese. They tasted like the following recipe place 5 large shrimp in a small casserole dish sprinkle with as little garlic powder as possible, add a hand full of cheese then put in the microwave until cheese melts. It was awful gag gag gag; it had no flavor at all I could even taste cheese.   Ok I will wrap this up as I now am rambling away. I am not a spice whimp I love Wasabi and lots of it, but this kind of hot is not for the average person who likes hot. I cannot tell you if the spicy dish was good because the heat ruined it for me and my family. My sister is the only one who liked it.   I will not be back, not worth the drive, the time, the money or the recovery!

Are you serious you thought Cannoli was soft and doughy ugh! It is supposed to be exactly the way they served it to you. Crispy golden brown on the outside and filled with sweet ricotta and chocolate chips, then dusted with a little powdered sugar.   Now I want a Cannoli! I will also take some tortellini alfredo cuz yeah it's damn good. I don't care for many Alfredo sauces other than my mother's or my own. But this one is Winner Winner Pasta dinner! The bread is good to.   I have had the Ziti, Chicken parm, and the Marsala. My favs from here are the Tortellini and the Marsala.   Then the Pizza, well lets just say delicious!

I love Capital Grille, I don't know how there is even one bad review. I have eaten here several times. I have always had excellent service and food. I love the shrimp cocktail, Calamari, and stuffed mushroom apps. The steak salad is great and the filet melts in your mouth. I tried the coconut cream pie and fell in love, it is amazing! It is pricey but so worth it. We usually go here for very special occasions.

YUM YUM YUM.... did I say YUM? Everything about this restaurant is fantastic. I love the decor, the outside patio is the best. The bar set up is great and I love that the have an open kitchen so you can see your food prepared. The chicken nachitos with extra guacamole YUMMY! The roasted chicken outstanding! I love the chipolte burger! The mac and cheese is definately something to write about don't miss out on the MAC! I also love that they serve the Passion fruit tea. This is very good food at a very good price. I have only had bad service once, I think our server was new or at least I hope she was. Otherwise she was just a ding bat that couldn't remember to come fill our drinks or bring the extras that we ordered. Don't keep this one a secret!

GREAT PRICE, GREAT PORTIONS, GREAT FOOD, & GREAT ATMOSPHERE!   Get there early and come hungry!   I love the Hog and Chick with the best bacon around! Recently tried the Chop and Chick OK I fell in love with Matt's all over again. WOOHOO that's a good pork chop. Try the griddlecakes as well they are outstanding.   I can't wait to try the lunches at Matt's but after a breakfast at Matt's I am full until Dinner.  Is it something about the name Eric?? Eric M you don't know what you are missing and Eric N are you sure you were at Matt's? You cannot get a better breakfast at any Denny's on any occasion! Matt's is actually cheaper than Denny's on certain Items and well lets face it most of what you get on Matt's menu you cannot come close to at Denny's.   The hog and chick is 2 eggs cooked with real butter to perfection, 2 slices thick cut pepper cured bacon, rosemary new potatoes with onions, thick cut wheat berry toast with homemade preserves! All for 6.50! With great Coffee & real cream 7.85.   The knock off Grand Slam at Denny's 2 eggs cooked with margarine not usually cooked correctly, 2 thin slices of regular bacon, shredded frozen potatoes (hash browns) usually not even brown, 2 slices of thin wheat toast with smuckers if your lucky for 5.99! With gross coffee & creamer 7.98!   I don't know about you but I prefer to pay 51cents more without coffee or .13 cents less with coffee oh and get real cream and possibly wait an hour to get a really tasty fresh like my grandma's breakfast, in a trendy spot that is bright, clean, and interesting! Than something I could heat up in a microwave and have some slob in a dirty uniform serve me in five minutes.   Also I feel the need to address the comment on the 8.00 pancakes that she thinks she can get at IHOP for 6.50. 1st I must also correct you Matt's griddlecakes are 6.00 not 8.00! Matt's griddlecakes are homemade not from a box, second they are lighter fluffier bigger and well let's face it just taste better than IHOP pancakes. 2nd Matt uses REAL MAPLE SYRUP.  So have your more expensive IHOP pancakes. By the way IHOP uses Maple flavored syrup not real maple syrup go ahead ask em. You cannot compare the two. Matt is in his own league. Top notch!  To all those who say the portions are small...I say your stomach's are to big.   To all those who say the prices are to high... I say if you cannot afford 9 to 13 dollars maximum with 15% tip, please visit the people making breakfast at home or find me a place that offers the same ingredients at the same quality for this lower price you speak off.  To all those who say I can make it at home... I say please do! So I can enjoy my Hog and Chick faster!   To all those who say the wait is too long....I say I'll good things come to those who wait, but great things come to those who wait outside MBB!  To all those who say Matt's is delicious.... I'll race you to the sign in and see you there!

I was over to Matt's again last week. I finally had a chance to try lunch here. OMG! This place should be called Matt's bad ass Butter Burger! Are you kidding me it is so amazingly delicious! I have been lucky I guess and have not had to wait to get into Matt's. But I would wait for one of these burgers any day! Katie food was OK are you nuts! First Watch can't even be compared to Matt's menu. UGH gimme a break!  Matt's ButterBurger is so freakin good I don't have words to describe the deliciousness of it all.

Well my fellow foodies, I have been to the promised land yet again. This time on a Saturday morning with 7 friends and 2 toddlers in tow. When we got there 2 couples were on the list ahead of us. We only had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes to be seated 6 of us were at the counter and 2 plus the toddlers were at a table.   Everyone loved the food, we had hog and chick, chop and chick, Waffles, Pancakes and the special 3 eggs scrambled with baby spinach, mushrooms and fontina cheese. Can you say delicious!   We were all very happy with our selections. Again the food gods must be smiling down upon me as I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table and my food has always been delicious!!!

Hi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!

Hey Abu what are you doing here?? Did you order my wings yet? What can I say about Rosie? Parking can be a pain, but after you park it's all good!  Gotta love this ol'girl! The wings are all drummies, oh yeah baby mommy likes! They are cooked well done so they are crispy and the have some beer based hot sauce that kicks your taste buds into high gear. I love the kettle chips too.   They have good drink specials and a full bar to choose from. I just love this little pub last time I was here I think Leprechauns took me home. : P

I like the Wei. I enjoy your kung pao shrimp, lettuce wraps, Pei Wei spicy chicken, and a recent fan of the lemon pepper shrimp.   I have not been able to find a decent Chinese take out by me. The west side is being dissed no pizza, no china-men, no fish. I need to open a restaurant clearly.   I find the dishes to be large, tasty, and relatively inexpensive. It's Chinese take out and next to the places I have tried in the area Pei Wei is a rock star!

I'm down wit the half moon, happy hour that is. The prices are right and the food was good. I like that you can tuck away if you want. I love the ample parking and the outside seating. It's clean and classy yet you could cut loose if ya wanted to. Some good eats are the Honey Chipotle boneless wings, sweet with a kick nice crunch to them as well. Also a must try is the Buffalo chicken dip scrumptious!  I was here in the evening last year with Cedric the entertainer. I have known him for years and he did the after party at the half moon. That was my first experience there. I like the half moon. Guys can hang at the bar or around the pool table. They have big screens everywhere and a dance floor for the ladies. Regular prices are a little high but happy hour fits my budget.   I am going there tomorrow for a little Happy time ya know. I would give 5 stars but the regular prices are a little steep for me. What can I say I guess I'm just a cheap skate or date. : ) Hey people we are in a recession!

I reserve my good as it gets for Shake and Shake...The holy grail of burgers! Now if they would just build one in AZ!   I love a good burger and as far as fast food this one is in my top 5 although it is the fresh cut fries that put In & Out in the top for me.   The list is as follows:   1 Steak N Shake: Mustard pickle onion only! No cheese, No tomato lettuce or MAYO UGH. You are ruining it by adding anything but the 1st three condiments. I am a purest.   2 In & Out: Light sauce add onions! Yum Well done French Fries please.   3 Whataburger: I love the A1 thick and hearty burger otherwise it's the double cheese with mustard and onion only.   4 Carls Jr: The superstar does me just fine! This would be my # 3 if they had good fries to go with that flame broiled burger but they have rockin onion rings!   5 Wendy and Burger King: They are in a tie for 5. I love the fresh never frozen burgers from Wendy's but the King had me at flame broiled. Although BK's Fries are NASTY and the onion rings have no onion in them WTF!?   I do enjoy the fresh toppings and delicious fries at In and Out. I also quite like to watch my food being prepared so I know there have been no shenanigan's!   If you really want to treat yourself get a double double with onion of course and then an order of fries well done. I add vinegar to my fries and they are out of this world delicious! Now go eat a burger I'm done talking to you.

This is the first Farmers market I have been to in Phoenix.   7 of my friends and I plus two 2 year old's decided to have a morning outing last Saturday. We met up at the Chris-town light rail and rode down to the Roosevelt stop. We walked over to Matt's Big Breakfast there were only 2 couples ahead of us so we waited about 10 minutes and were seated yeah 10 of us! After our delicious breakfast we walked to the market for a bit of shopping.   It was about 100 degrees out but you really couldn't tell. The market was completely covered by tents and they were running huge swamp coolers that were blowing very cold!   I bought some beautiful opal basil a huge bunch for 2 dollars! Another bunch of lemon basil same deal. I bought 2 great eggplant for a dollar each and they were delicious! The tomato oh my I got a couple green, a couple yellow, and a couple red all six were a little larger than a baseball for 6.50! I have not had a tomato that good since Illinois. I also bought some hand made dark chocolate, a pair of copper earrings, some orange blossom honey, and some vermouth olives (great for Martini's).   All in all it was a fun day with great friends and some great finds at the market! I will be back.

Shocking!!!! I am surprised at the bad Zoe reviews. Maybe it's what your ordering?   Well maybe not so shocked it is healthy food peeps! It's not slathered in something or deep fried it is fresh. For a chain I rather like Zoe's. I have a great palate and do not eat a lot of sauces and such I like to taste the food.   I enjoy the Mediterranean tuna with capers, calamata olives, and red onion. served on Zoe slaw. I am not a big fan of mayo so this oil based tuna is way better to me.   Other Yummy choices... The chicken kabobs ask for well done a little dried but brown and tasty with rice and a salad.  The tuna or chicken salads on 7 grain wheat is yummy, albeit a lttle plain I like it.  I love the spinach quesadilla and the yummy salsa with just a lil kick.  Try the chicken roll ups tasty with a lil salsa! The cake is delish!   Rock out with your chicken out Zoes I will see you tomorrow!

Sorry DOG. This used to be the spot for a great Chicago dog or a slider or an Italian beef or sausage. Back when Louie and Eddie a couple a wise guys from Chicago actually owned the joint!   The new owner is a tool! It reflects in the crappy food. This jag off is a whiner too. I'd like to smack him in the head with the soggy ass chi dog he served up. You can't skimp on the poppy bun either! This stugots is screwing up a good thing.  Like I said before selling the recipes to a new owner isn't always going to be a good thing. Here it is not.   RUN FORREST RUN! Nothing to eat here.

Warning Danger DO NOT ENTER! Gross! This place is nasty! If I could give it less than a star yea I would have.   While out running errands over the weekend I decided to be adventurous, & try a new place I had never tried. So I find myself driving down Indian School rd and see the Chinese buffet sign. I thought great because I was not sure what I wanted and with a buffet there are so many choices right? WRONG!   The choices were not many and the food was not good. The rice tasted like dirt. I had some mushrooms that were good. Everything was labeled wrong. They had fried chicken wings the size of my pinky. If these came off a chicken it must have been a chick. The egg foo young looked like scrambled eggs with mushrooms. This place is gross. We took one bite of everything on our plates and when nothing tasted good we left!   We told them your buffet is garbage and we left. BTW we did not pay for it either.

My people, my people, my people. Freddy's is a fraud! It is a knock off of the Midwest darling Steak and Shake and they ARE famous for steakburgers! It burns my buns that they copied Steak and Shake. If you have ever had both you know what I am talking about. It's like listening to your favorite song for years, and then some idiot does a remake and screws it up!  Little info on SNS: Steak n Shake was founded in 1934 in Normal, Illinois. Gus Belt, the founder of Steak n Shake, was a quality restaurateur who owned a restaurant/gas station called Shell's Chicken. Central Illinois had plenty of chicken and beer restaurants so Gus soon realized he needed to be unique and different. With a little help from his friends, he started Steak n Shake in February of 1934.   The Steak stood for STEAKBURGER™ sandwich. Gus would wait for the busiest time in his counter-only restaurant, wheel in a barrel of steaks (including round steak, sirloin steak, and T-bones) and grind the steaks into burgers right in front of the guests. Hence, the origin of the famous slogan "In Sight It Must Be Right."   The STEAKBURGER™ sandwich is still the finest burger served anywhere in the world-the finest of steaks ground into pucks, and through the art of grilling on a very hot grill, turned into a burger beyond comparison.   Freddy copied the idea from Gus. When Steak and Shake franchised and moved east stretching from Illinois to Pennsylvania down to Florida. That is when Freddy decided to begin moving west from Kansas. At the time Steak and Shake was only as far west as St. Louis, MO. Freddy uses the same signature colors red, black and white. SNS standard steak burger comes with mustard, a slice of onion, and 2 long slices of classic dill pickle. FFC serves it the same except the bun is different and the pickle is a spicy claussen type. SNS serves skinny fries with salt. FFC serves them with seasoned salt. SNS has hand dipped shakes. FFC does custard.   Now that steak and shake is making it's advancement further west, currently Dallas is the furthest, FFC will be toast!   I have eaten at FFC, and they do make a decent steakburger. I love steakburgers and this is as close to the original as you will find west of Dallas. However having tasted the original from SNS I cannot be as excited as other yelpers about this phony. In my opinion Freddy ruins the burger with those over powering pickles and the fries are to skinny to support seasoned salt it is over powering. I am not into custard so cannot remark on that.   I like In and Out better than Freddy's but not better than Steak N Shake. Also you cannot compare a Steakburger to and In and Out Burger.   For those Steak N Shake fans out there, if you order a steak burger from Freddys, don't get the pickles and ask for regular salt on your fries.   I can't wait for Steak N Shake to make it to Phoenix, I will be camped out at the front door!

New owner's rock Rosati's! This location was going to hell in a hand basket. The new owner's have successfully resuscitated it!   I had stopped going to Rosati's several years ago after repeated bad service, rude un - knowledgeable employee's, and lifeless products! Also I had inquired with the previous owner about doing a 400.00 catering order that I needed delivered by 11:15am. He told me they do not open until 11am so he wouldn't be able to do it! UGH what a stugots!   Anyway on to the new. I received a fax that the ownership had changed and I thought what the heck, I will give it a shot. Some co-workers decided they wanted in. GO figure isn't that always how it is.   I ordered the baked Mostaccioli lunch special it comes with a can of whatever Coke product you like. I added two meatballs. Plus a garlic bread stick. Total 7.50! Not bad at all I thought. Well it was a bargain and a half the dish is HUGE! It comes in a 9inch Togo pan! I shared with a co worker and still have tomorrow's lunch covered as well! The meatballs are very very good and I am damn picky about my meatball's. Just the right amount of marinara, noodles al dente, and covered in melted mozzarella! They got this dish right.   My coworkers got the meatball sandwich's, that sucker is huge too! Smothered in melted mozzarella with fries and a coke 5.70!   It was delish! I will be back. To try many other items, I will keep you posted. Almost forgot they have Eli's Cheesecake!!!!!! Note there is no dining in it is all carry out or delivery.   4 stars for the food quality, the 5th star is for the portion to price!  The menu is huge so check them out on-line. www.rosatisonthomas.com

Me Likey Wingy!  I have not been to this new location yet.   The old location was a pit. a hole, the ghetto of restaurants, this location was filthy funk nasty! But dammit the wings were outstanding!   There were plenty o night I would travel down 7th ave to McDowell to retrieve a dozen of these delectable delights! The fries are good too!   Now that they have moved I need to check out the new location. In it's place there has been erected yet another chain restaurant. Pei Wei and Starbucks together. WTF??? Can I get a Rice bowl and a Latte? : P

Peter Wongs is just one footstep behind Big Wongs and gaining momentum fast. Rumor has it that Gina (former owner of Big Wong's has been in the kitchen!   I must report that the egg roll's have evolved and are very similar to Gina's now. When I 1st visited Peter Wong's I was not impressed with the egg roll.   The walnut shrimp is much better than before the walnuts taste more like Gina's they were firm and sweet. The shrimp was large and plump with just the right amount of sauce.   Mongolian beef be still my heart, it was full of delicious firm onions and scallions and SPICY! Delish!   We also had the general tso chicken and it was tender and light with just the right amount of kick to it.   Kung Pao chicken was unusual...they added water chestnuts and the sauce was light but spicy. I really enjoyed it. It was very unexpected and quite good.   All in all I will be back! Best in the area, no one can take the place of my beloved Gina but Peter Wong's is on the right track for SURE!

Great food great price. Went to try La Piazza after seeing an episode of Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive in's, and Dives. Turns out La Piazza is less than a mile from my house! Bonus!   We went around 3:30pm since I am up at 4 am my dinner starts earlier than most. However the restaurant closes weekdays between 3pm and 5pm one thing that I didn't like. Oh well we window shopped in downtown Glendale and waited for them to reopen. When we returned at 5pm there was a line to get in. We were seated right away. Our waiter Michael was very friendly and told us of the specials. This night it was Spaghetti pie. He told us that they do not make the pie on a regular basis. It is made on a whim some days they have some they don't it is not on the menu. Let me just say YUMMMMMMMMY! It is HUGE! Spaghetti with bits of cheese throughout served with a very flavorful marinara sauce and it's delicious!   We had the veggie pizza as an appetizer and it was fantastic the crust was incredible. My friend had the Rigatoni Al Forno - Rigatoni noodles, grilled chicken, broccoli, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, garlic and olive oil topped with mozzarella!   Winner winner pasta dinner! If you have never eaten here go right now! Unless it's between 3pm and 5pm Monday through Friday. They are not always opened on Sundays either so call ahead. Also be aware that if there is more than one person at your table your food may come out seperately. They want you to get your food hot and fresh. So as soon as they have made it you get it.  I will definately return.

Let me take you on a journey through time, about 6 years ago I was introduced to this Cajun temptress! My brother called and said "I found a place with all you can eat lobster"! I said "WTF? Are you serious"? All you can eat LOBSTER! We immediately made plans to go. It was the beginning of summer just about dusk on a Friday. We arrived and entered the brick courtyard I call it. The had a live band playing really good happy jazz, they had fans and misters going. There's a fountain it's funky and fun so we didn't mind the wait to get in. We had some drinks and decided to try some appetizers. It was a large group of us mind you. We tried the alligator, mussels, oysters on the half & some seafood fondeaux. My fav is the gator. Yummy my niece who was 2 at the time ended up eating a full order of the alligator herself.   I think our table ate about 40 lobsters! We asked our server "what is the most anyone person has eaten at one time"? We thought 9 or 10 we were wrong 18 was the magic number. Holy melted butter batman that's a lot of crustacean for one person! I have never had a bad meal at Pappa's.   I don't really care for the fried selections at Pappa's. Main courses that is catfish, shrimp and other fish for example. The coating or breading or whatever you want to call it isn't very good to me.   Some of my fav's are as follows:   Fried Alligator (the breading is different)  Andouille sausage and seafood gumbo  The dirty rice!  Crawfish Etouffee  Shrimp Creole  The seafood grill  Pasta Mardi Gras!  Mahi Maribella  Steaks - yes I did say steaks normally I would not recommend ordering a steak at a seafood restaurant, do it here they are wonderful.  Banana pudding (served in a mason jar) Love it!  Sweet potato pecan pie YA-HUM!   The last time I was here I had the Mahi with broccoli and just let me say that was the best broccoli I had ever had! Ever! It was huge bright vibrant green and perfectly steamed and buttered! It was outstanding!   The have a great happy hour from 4 to 6:30 Mon - Fri.   You will pay a little more here but it is so worth it! I put the $ mark at 11 to 30 per person, depending on what you get. it is probably closer to 45 a person when you add in drinks and an appetizer. My recommendation go with a group of friends everyone order different items and share. You won't be disappointed.

After writing the review the other day I had a taste for Pappa's. So I went last night and YA-HUMMEE! I tried something new the Hudson platter and this baby did not disappoint! Perfectly grilled scallops, 2 succulent and sweet lobster tails, 4 huge shrimp brochette. If you are not familiar with shrimp brochette it is shrimp stuffed with Monterey jack cheese and a sliver of Jalapeno, wrapped in bacon and char -grilled. DELICIOUSNESS! It is served with the fabulous dirty rice and sauteed green beans all for are you ready for this wait for it 22.95!   I also indulged in sharing a little pecan sweet potato pie with Hagen daas vanilla ice cream and bourbon sauce. WOOHOO! FYI all deserts purchased until July 26th will have a portion of the proceeds go to a local food bank!   Dinner last night was sooo freakin good I may be back tonight! Bon Appetite

I love Costco! I am a Costco junkie. I get all kinds of stuff here and yes I have occasionally even bought clothes. Now in retrospect I think I have bought all of my swimsuits here for the last 6 years. Hey back off they carry speedo's for about 20 bucks now that's a deal!   I love the shrimp cocktail here I get that at least once a week you get like 30 beautiful shrimp for 10 bucks with sauce and lemon. The chicken salad is very good. I always get, french beans & hard salami as well. The prices for the cheeses are really good as well.   I get my puppies dog food here too! You can't beat the ready made food either. The roasted chicken is fantastic! The cuts of beef are amazing. Sometimes about half way through my shopping I will call the food court and order an everything pizza. Once I go to the checkout I let them know I ordered a pizza and they ring me up there and I go pick it up on my way out. Also the twist frozen yogurt is yummy! For 10 bucks that's a good pizza!   Do park in the back on the montebello side, or if it works for you take the light rail.

Well I have to give a shout out to my fellow yelper "Daren C."! Good lookin out on the Culver's. I had an opportunity to make this journey over the weekend and was not disappointed!   The butter burger is far superior to Freddy's Steakburger. I love the crinkle cut fries as well. This joint was packed on Saturday! I like that I can get grilled onions on my burger yum.   Culver's is A+ I would definitely recommend it!

OK yelpers here goes..... I AM IN LOVE WITH CHRISTOPHERS! Delish~!   I usually only eat at the high end froofy restaurants a couple times a year. 1 because prices are high and 2 the servings usually small and let us not forget the Ala cart menu's. Lets face it up scale dining has come to sauces as a side dish. Never the less I like to be adventurous and splurge now and then!   I really like the decor the ginormous front door is cool and it opens to a very elegant, hip and trendy kind of suave atmosphere. I'm diggin the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant too. The funky board listing the specials and the almost unisex bathroom. Be careful here that you choose the correct side. The sink is fun except when you reach under the trickles of water and find yourself bumping your hand against someone on the other side. Yeah it happened to me :P   I started with the Jasmin blackberry infused green tea. Yum! Mind you it is lunchtime so no liquor for me thanks. Although I maybe could have used just a sip or two today. I chose the butter poached lobster, arugula, pine nut and roasted fennel vinaigrette salad. WOW that was tasty and large enough to split with a friend so I did.  For the main course I selected the Smoked truffle infused filet Mignon! OH YEAH MOMMY LIKES~! OMG I know it is over used but OMG! This steak was so delectable I wanted another for desert. Is that wrong? It comes with your choice of 3 sauces to compliment it. I think a Bearnaise, I know a red wine reduction or a brandy peppercorn. I chose the brandy peppercorn, but this steak was so outstanding I didn't want to ruin it with my fork. Let alone a sauce. Do I ordered it on the side. I did try the sauce and it was heaven. So I used it to dip my veggie mix in. Heck ya I'm a little silly like that.   Lets just say if this was a meal eaten at home the plate would have been licked clean! By far hands down the best filet I have eaten to date. I am from the Midwest and we ate steak at least once a week. This steak was amazing, delectable, outstanding, stupendous and did I say good?   The service was spot on! Our server knew everything about the menu and described everything in great detail! Bravo!  Go now and eat it! Christopher I could kiss you! You get 10 steak knives up for that meal.  THANKS, your latest groupie~  PS. Diners leave your kids at home, this is no place for them ever! Go hire a sitter, if you can afford to eat here you can afford to pay someone to watch your screaming child so I don't have to. Cheesecake factory is around the corner and they love your kids. :)

A little Birdie told me I might be able to stuff my face here. Yeah the bird was right.   It sits in a strip mall on the SE corner of 7th ave and Missouri. They have a few tables and chairs inside. It is a store and deli but they serve up some good eats.   They have many healthy options here. My best friend cannot eat beef or pork. She like DD's because she can get chicken and turkey alternatives. Such as Turkey meat loaf, which I have to admit didn't sound good to me but I reluctantly tried it and it was good. I had this linguine with turkey sausage and peppers that was delish!   They have a black eyed pea salad that is very good, & I didn't even like Black eyed peas before! Also try the gumbo wow is it good.   You can go here and shop get lunch, cooking and baking supplies, even sign up for cooking lessons. Check it out great for lunch.

Based on the Yelp reviews I wanted to use this company. I spoke to Brenda on Thursday 06/02/2016 and scheduled an appointment for Monday 06/06/2016 between 8am-10am to look at my AC unit and duct work to see what work needs to be done.   She was very nice and explained that they should come early in the day because of the heat and having to go into my attic. I agreed and that worked better because my husband could take the morning off from work pretty easily.   So Monday is here and Flores Air Conditioning reps are not. At 10:15 am I received a call from Brenda telling me that she didn't have a rep to send out. BAD BAD BAD customer service! I told her my husband took the morning off to meet them. She said "I tried to call you on Friday to re-schedule you for Saturday; and I couldn't leave a message your voicemail was full". WRONG I do not have a voice mail set up! I told her "I didn't have a missed call from her".    I went on to ask "Why would you wait until 15 minutes AFTER the scheduled appointment window to call and say you had no one to send? You should have called promptly at 8am". Her response "I wanted to see if I might have someone before 10am but I don't" My response; "if you were aware on Friday that you wouldn't have anyone for Monday and you weren't able to reach me on Friday; you should have called back on Saturday or the very least Monday morning to advise us of the situation, that way we could decide how we wanted to proceed. However you didn't do that and my husband has missed a half a day of work for nothing!" This is not how I do business and if this is how it starts I will end this relationship RIGHT HERE!

BEWARE DANGER DANGER EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!  Great Cheryl really??!? You must work at this one. I am a fan of Jack don't get me wrong but this location is JACKED UP! Service sucks, food sucks, management sucks, cleanliness sucks. Wow this place really sucks!   1. They are always out of everything ranch, onions, ketchup, curly fries, coke. WTF Jack. Seriously when I was in high school and worked fast food when you ran out of something you ran to another location and got it!   2. Don't order the taco's! We all know that Jack makes deliciously greasy cheapo taco's. These at this location are always nasty soaked in grease. When you pick them up grease pours off. Yuck! Also sometimes you get lettuce sometimes you don't. Sometimes you get cheese sometimes you don't. I have even gotten one with cheese and lettuce the other with sauce only.   3. The workers are always dirty like they have been working all week in the same uniform without cleaning it.   4. Don't try to special order anything they will mess it up every time.   I am all for second chances and I have given this location about 22 chances since they are close to my office. But no more I will never go back to this one! Today was the topper, I ordered food and as I was ready to hand over my credit card I see a condom, it appeared to be used, laying on the side of the drive thru window. I pulled my credit card back and drove off!

Do all the cool kids hang out here? Yea they do!   Once again Carolina's has won my heart with her fantastic tortilla's, once you have one you will be disappointed with any other! Both locations I have visited offer stellar tortillas! Thanks for being consistent!   I had my usual Machaca (shredded beef with onions, chilies & spices) Burrito with Papas (potatoes) :P You gotta try one the beef is tender and juicy but not sloppy wet. It is seasoned to perfection with just a mild heat. The potatoes just add another dimension of deliciousness!  My friend had the chicken burrito I tried it but did care for it. The chicken is a mix of white and dark meat and it was on the dry side. She put a ton of hot sauce on it. Also she said she thought it may be better mixed with beans and cheese.   I will see you soon Carolina!

Move over Starbucks meet your competition! While the prices are about the same and lower, Dutch has a better roast and not a bunch of hoopla!   This location is a small stand with double drive thru! You are in and out fast! I like the lids way better too. You don't spill and you don't need a stopper either. If you're sick of bucks and the burnt beans go see Dutch!   Yumm!

Well here we are again visiting another lovely chain restaurant. I like to eat at subway when it is done right. This location is very clean, so is the staff if you know what I mean. They are friendly and courteous quick too.   The ingredients at this location are very fresh, I cannot say the same for some of the other locations.   I will give this one the thumbs up go ahead eat fresh lol!

There is a new DD in town on Bethany Home and the I-17. It is on the north east corner of Bethany and the black canyon frontage road. It is a drive thru as well. Did you know they have hot sandwiches as well.   Check it out, the store is very nice, the workers very friendly and helpful. They open at 4 am! Tell all your friends in the area it is kind of hidden behind the gas station. It is in the complex with the big lots!

They have some really great flat bread sandwiches! They should advertise it. I had the ham and cheese flat bread sandwich yummy!   My friend had the egg white and turkey sausage flat bread and said it was delish. Who knew they had these healthy options at DD. I sure didn't I used to go for the munchkins. Now I am going for the flat bread sammies! Their iced tea is pretty good too! I know many people rave about the coffee. I personally have never had it. Just not a big coffee drinker.   Any who check out the DD this one rocks!

Yay I'm a fan of this sandwich!   Italiano sandwich - Genoa salami, ham, capicola, tomatoes, pepperoncini, provolone & Romano topped with fresh mozzarella, romaine lettuce and Italian vinaigrette served on fresh baked foccacia. This sandwich is delicious the foccacia was peppered the mozzarella is very fresh, this sandwich itself gets 5 stars! So freakin good! There is something delicious happening here. The salt and pepper of the meats and cheese blend just right. THIS SAMMY WILL MAKE YA SLAP YA MAMMY! Split it with a co-worker for lunch oh yay!

Well I don't know Rand but I know Glenn to be a pretty good judge of food until now. Maybe we went on days with different cooks or something. I was very disappointed.   My friend and I could not agree on a place to eat so we thought what the heck check out the new Buffet. Looks the same as the old country Buffet only darker, about every other light bulb was out. Just the feel of this place was off to me. We arrive about 20 minutes after they opened, yet the majority of the items on the Buffet appeared to have been there overnight.   Almost every item I tried was overcooked. Way over cooked. I tried the following:   Egg roll...Yuck!!!!!!  Crab Ragoon....more like a hollow wonton  Beef and broccoli....really how do you mess this up? With bad broccoli!  Spicy chicken..Lets just say I don't think it was chicken  General Tsao chicken.....was just sweet no spice and soggy...bluck  Mongolian stir fry.....ok but not worth the trip  Mushrooms....decent  Fried potatoes...good  Fried rice...crusty no flavor  Fried Fish....good  Fried shrimp...doughy with the vein  some pork dish....don't remember  Rib tips...dried up and no flavor  Wings....of a pigeon maybe  California roll....no flavor, fell apart, and was dry.  Wasabi....no, green paste WTF?  Chinese donut.....Yummy   The seafood was scary looking. I ended up eating fried fish that they had just brought out & fried potatoes and the only reason they have a star is because they have a very good Chinese donut!   I know a Buffet sounds good sometimes but do yourself a favor & drive past this joint! Head to 15th ave and camelback just a few blocks away and visit Peter Wongs! For more details check out my Wong review!

Now before you rush to judgment let me explain....   After reading many stellar reviews, I thought how can I go wrong. Well everyone can have an off night. This was an evening of highs and lows that led me to the 2 star review. If I go back someone else is paying, lets just start right there.   I met some friends for dinner, excited by the reviews and the chance to try a new menu we decided on The Vig Uptown. We arrived to a crowded lot but no bother they have complimentary valet parking! Very nice. It was however a little confusing on how to get in and no one directed us. It wasn't until the massive door like something out of Willy Wonka's opened that we figured out how to get in. The interior is very trendy and artistically pleasing. The indoor outdoor patio is a nice touch. The booths are huge enough room for at least 6 adults. So far you have me at 5 stars.   Our server a little mousy thing finally came trotting over to ask us for a drink order and referred us to the drink menu. Stating we have several house specials. My friend and I both fairly savvy when it comes to liquor, spot an item that we are unfamiliar with. So we inquire about the Queen's English which boasts a pimm's no 1 cup. We are told she thinks it has cucumber in it but shes not sure. She goes to the bar and returns with the following answer "it's a liquor". Not quite the answer we were wanting so we just order something else. Red Beer, Stella and Vodka martini dirty. ; )   Side bar my thinking is if the Queen's English is on your specials menu you would like to know what is in it, so that you may better serve your guests. But that's just me. Now we are at 4 stars.   We ordered the onion rings and traditional wings. The onion rings were very good but I would have like to have been given something to dip in besides ketchup. BLUCK. The traditional wings were far from traditional but they were delicious.   On to the entrees, I decided to have the The Uptown Steak Sandwich...charbroiled, sliced bistro tenderloin, with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, arugula, roasted red peppers, Swiss cheese and horseradish mayo on a sub roll. Are you freaking kidding me that sounds amazing, I've gotta have it. Oh and the bonus sweet potato fries....heck yeah! The fries were some of the best I have ever had. Bravo! The sandwich fell short. The bread was very heavy, dry and thick. The horseradish mayo was missing in action, the amount was so small you couldn't taste it. The Tenderloin was spot on however, the mushrooms we few and far between. I ended up dumping everything out of the roll.   I tried my friends Persian Chicken kabob and it had no flavor. She didn't like it either.   I wish our server had been more attentive. I can't tell you who she was she never told us her name. She seemed very inexperienced and we had to wait awhile for water after stopping her as she went by.   All in all not good. I really wish these restaurants would quit focusing on a size 2 female servers and start focusing on a server that has experience and knows their job! The girls are pretty but I am not there to check out servers. I want to check out the food and the service.   PS this place is very loud and more of a bar atmosphere, not a place for kids. I saw a few women with babies well under a year old. THIS IS NOT A KID FRIENDLY RESTAURANT.

Here we are again over a year later, a friend insisted on coming here. I tried to tell her but she wouldn't listen. I told her I am not going to the Vig again, she said she was buying and she had her heart set on going. I figured it has been a long time and maybe I got them on an off night. So we went.  Then it was down hill from there. 15 minutes for our ditsy size 0 server to arrive. She was more concerned with texting and flirting with another table of three guys, to be concerned with us. This is the 2nd time I have gotten an idiot server here and I have only been here twice. I will revisit the server after I speak on the food.   The food took forever & they were not very busy, 27 minutes! For a Tandoori Shrimp salad , that they forgot to put shrimp on & the Frenchy well I think this sandwich would definitely offend the French. There was very little meat and it was way over cooked. Then it was another 10 minutes for my friend to get her shrimp!   Back to the server..... Wouldn't you notice when bringing the food to the table that a Shrimp salad had no shrimp?! I mean she took the order, she entered the order and she delivered the order. When we told her um excuse me isn't this salad supposed to have grilled shrimp? She replied " oh yea, it's not under the lettuce?" then she left and came back after 10 minutes with the shrimp. No apology nothing!  Vig quit thinking you are the only game in town, I will not be back even if someone else pays!  The only good thing here in my opinion is the building. Step up your service and your food quality and you would be great!

Well I like to give a place at least two visits before I complete a review unless something is outstanding.   I really enjoyed the food and the service was great. The space was nicely decorated as well.  Sadly I went with a friend on Saturday and they had closed the previous Monday. So Zing is no more.

Not sure how to rate this place. I tried to order breakfast based on other people in my office. I ran into a little snag, the menu I have for them doesn't list their phone number. Only a web address! Get this the website is down under construction! How do you print menu's with no phone number and only a web address that is under construction? I could not find a number on the web either. Before coming here I called the Tempe location they didn't know the number either nor did they care to try and get it for me they hung up! Bad business. So as of right now I cannot rate the food only the sucky service. I doubt I will be trying the food after this fiasco!

If you are looking for a taste-bud treat go to Capriotti's! I have to tell you I don't like cranberry sauce. However the Bobbie changed my mind! Shredded turkey topped with mayo and a very generously seasoned stuffing and then cranberry sauce! It is so freaking GOOD!   I have been using Capriotti's for quite a while for catering in my office. I have tried several different sammies from Capriotti's. Among my favorites. The Bobbie, The Slaw B Jo, The Italian & the Tuna. The Slaw B Jo is shredded roast beef, slaw, provolone cheese and Russian dressing. I like it lite on the dressing. This used to be my favorite until I tasted the Bobbie.   I am with Devon I wish they had one in the north west. Let's see one would fit right around 43rd ave and Bethany hint hint!   Bye the way get a large cut it in half, eat one half now and save the other for later. They are huge and it is a better deal that way.   Anyway they make a very tasty sub. Like I said they do catering too!

Let me start by saying this.....Get here and get the fish tacos!   The fish is very lightly breaded Swai and it's perfectly seasoned with a nice crunch to the outside and a very tender flaky inside. The torilla is flour not corn and it's served with a Chipotle mayo and cabbage. You can get grilled onions and Jalapenos on the side no additional charge and it's delish! I really enjoy the mild salsa served with them. They are on the small side 3 or 4 bites tops so order 3 or 4 of these gems!  I am trying to work my way through the entire menu however I love the fish taco's so much I have just been adding things here and there or bringing a friend with me to try what they get. :)  I have had their Quesadilla's the cheese is good, the Qusadilla with Carne Asada is really good the pork is on the sweet side which I enjoyed. It may not be for everyone. The Quesadilla's are very large and cheesy!  I did venture out and try the Molote (masa fritter with potao and chorizo) It was not real spicy which I had expected it to be with Chorizo but I really liked it. The texture was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside the topping was black bean and oaxaca cheese.   This is a great little dive!

The service at this location has always been fast and friendly.   These are awesome big ole greasy burgers! GO EAT ONE!  Side bar (Debbie S) Post your review once not on every location that you have never been too that is just plain RUDE!

Zupas officially opens today! I was invited to their VIP catering event a few days ago and was able to get a sneak peek.   The soups are very good; I tasted all of them! My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!  I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.  The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!  The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly.   They also cater which is a big plus!

UM Yum!!!!   Sandra Dee's was parked outside of my office today. The advertisment sent by our complex via email was very unassuming. It simply stated Sandra Dee's Catering with a picture of a truck and a short list of menu items. Benigets, coffee, biscuits and gravey Chicken and waffles. I thought hmmm not everyone can do biscuits and gravy justice maybe I'll check it out.   Then I looked them up on Yelp and found that Sandra Dee is from Louisianna! Jack pot! It's against the law to be from Louisianna and not know how to cook B N G! Well at least it should be. So now fueled with this new information I am on a mission to hit up this food truck!  Wow the flavor! A few bites of biscuit were dry however the generous serving of very flavorful gravy moistened it right up! I will definately keep my eye out for more goodies from Miss Sandra Dee! I think the Dee is for Deelish!  Might have to go back for a Beniget!

The owner of this location is very nice, the cakes are delish! The cakes are fun and come in so many flavors and different sizes they have something for everyone.   A+ in my book!   Just confused about Shirley S thinking the store only being open until 4pm on Sunday isnt satisfactory for Monday through Friday working folks to get cake. :/   The hours seem fine to me! Carry on and let the Bundting begin!

Well well well look who came to town! We have been waiting for you, ya little vixen!  Steak N Shake is famous for Steakburgers! In sight it must be right!   Just a minute SNS fans this is not your typical SNS this is the adult version. You are not being waited on by a server at this location. This is the new Steak N Shake Signature!   Some of you will be sad to learn that you cannot get Chili Mac or Chili 5 ways boo hiss! However with this limited menu you still get what SNS is famous for Steakburgers and the revved up gourmet versions as well. The Shakes and chili are also on this menu.   So if you a craving a steakburger and fries and a shake come here and eat them!

OK folks I'm seriously getting irritated with the one and 2 stars because this location doesn't have the full menu.   All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250,000 to open the new "Signature" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger, Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same, you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934, Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!  I've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!

The food here is very good. I had the Al Pastor for the first time this weekend and it did not disappoint! The grilled onion, cactus and jalapeno combo inside my burrito yes please! with beans and cheese! Very tasty not spicy! $6.00 and it was 2 meals for me, these burros are big!  I'm a huge fan of their Carne Asada as well.   I am sad to report that they are moving from 43rd ave and Camelback to 50th ave and Bethany Home. 5060  W Bethany Home Ste#1 Glendale, AZ 85301 to be exact. Still not far from my house though! I will continue to get their bangin Burritos!   ******Important info****** They are a CASH ONLY establishment! They are mostly Spanish speaking employees there have been times I have been there and no one speaks English. So be prepared to order in Spanish.  So in short brush up on your Española, put 10 bucks in your pocket and go get a great meal!

Ok folks great Chinese food here!!!! They have a really good walnut shrimp aka crystal shrimp aka mayonnaise shrimp aka honey walnut shrimp. Lots of aliases for one dish! Not as good as Gina's from Big Wong moment of silence........... but very close! I definitely recommend ordering off the Chinese menu! The French style filet is sublime! The filet is tender and delicious! The beef chow fun doesn't disappoint either delish! The Singapore rice noodle is sooooooooooooo good.                                                     I highly recommend going here be adventurous try the Chinese menu the dishes are way better!

I have this friend from New York........ So I go to the shack, no one waiting the place is empty at 2:30 on a Friday. I'm a virgin; I let them know this. Were they anxious to give me suggestions or explain the offerings at all: NOPE! The employees couldn't be less interested in selling anything. In fact the mood was as if I was bothering them. I certainly missed out on some workweek hijinks from the very personal conversations that were taking place. Off to a shaky start, pun intended. Whenever I inquired how is this burger or how is that shake; the standard it's good was replied. I decide to be a purest and go for an original Shackburger, cooked Medium. Fries and the Salted Caramel shake.   While waiting for you food I noticed the décor which is fun and trendy. There is a fixin's bar with ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, salt and pepper you get the idea. I grab the things I want and have a seat.   $5.29 The burger a single patty seemed about 3 to 4 ounces, prepared correctly but NO flavor. I added salt and pepper it was less bland. It is very small for the price. The bun was nice and soft it actually had more flavor than the beef.   $2.99 The fries, let my preface this with I love crinkle cut fries, these were not my fav. In my opinion they weren't even as good as Del Taco's. I don't use much salt but these were in dire need of salting! They were on the hard side as well perhaps over cooked a bit. Which again I normally like but these fell flat. Nothing exciting, small portion and over priced.   $5.29 The shake was the worst part of my meal, it was so sweet I could not drink it! It tasted like a third of this very small cup was pure caramel. I thought if I mix it up more it will get better and that didn't help, it was unbearable I had to throw it out. The price on this very small shake about 12 to 16 ounces maybe? Um no thank you! I'll go across the street to Dairy Queen and get a better shake.   So in closing for almost $15.00, I had a kids meal in a fancy space. Sorry Shake Shack I wont be back.   For a sit down burger joint I will continue with my fav Steak N Shake, Twice the food for 2 3rds the price! Flavorful Original Double Steakburger, Large fry, Large Hand dipped shake under $10.00 Delish!

I have eaten here a few times now and have not been dissapointed!  Brunch Croque Mansieur! OO LA LA OMG! Heaven on a plate, the bechamel is so good and the ham is a little sweet, the tomato really balances the dish. I ordered the Poached egg on top it was perfect!   The Gumbo is delish the smokey sausage and the head on shrimp set this chicken gumbo up. It's one of the best gumbo's I've ever eaten. I really reminds me of our trip to New Orleans. Only thing missing was a piece of French bread to get every drop out of my bowl!  My mother had the Cuban po boy it wasn't what I expected from a Po boy but very good.   The grilled watermelon salad is amazing! The wedge was equally delicious! We had Beniets and Cafe Au lait yummmmmmmmm!  The shrimp and cheesy grits were so creamy and flavorful will definately have this dish again. I think a little larger portion and again a piece of bread or a bisquit to go with it.   I really love how they revitalized the old Beefeaters! It is a really great space and what Beckett has done here definately turns heads. It is a fun rustic kinda sexy open space.   The only draw back in my opinion is we were pestered by a few fly's that should be addressed and I would like to see the shrimp and grits be a larger portion. Other than that Bravo! I will be back!
