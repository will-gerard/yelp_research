I had a great time at the Phoenix Zoo this past weekend. I'm originally from the Pacific Northwest, which has good zoos full of cold weather animals. The Phoenix Zoo is full of hot weather animals (makes sense), but it really nicely laid out and has a ton to do. We had free passes that day, so we skipped the line and didn't have to pay, which probably colors my view a bit, but we walked around for 4 hours and saw almost every exhibit and habitat that we could, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The Lions and the Rhino were amazing...The Jaguar was beautiful, and just paced around his area, like he was stalking prey. There is a cool baboon exhibit, and so many other animals that you can see, from Bighorn Rams to the Komodo Dragon. The coolest area is this wide open space with the giraffes, and it also has longhorns and ostriches. It's a huge space, and you can really see the animals run around be more natural. The elephant and turtles are pretty cool too.   In other news, I had a kindred spirit moment at the otter habitat. True story:  I've always felt like my spirit animal is an otter (yeah, I said it), and when I went to see the otters, there was one outside laying on a log. After I'd been standing there a minute, he perked up, looked back at me and walked away into his little house thing. A few seconds later, TWO otters came out of the rocks and they came outside and swam around, ultimately ending up at a patch of grass right in front of the railing I was looking over, and both were staring at me. The guy next to me said "wow, I've never seen them do this. I've been coming here regularly for more than a year and they always just hang out on the log". I wasn't the only one that noticed the fact that the otters were clearly excited that I was there...Definitely one of my top animal/human moments so far in my life.  After the otter experience it was bound to be a 5 star day, but I also got to ride a camel...Yes, I rode a camel.  In short, the Phoenix Zoo is great. I've lived her almost two years and had never been. If you've yet to go, do it soon, and say hi to the otters for me.

"Hey, honey...Do we need 614 pounds of pickles? They're a good price..."  This is a common conversation you'll overhear while shopping at Costco. It's a wonderful place.   In just two hours I can get an eye exam, eat a hot dog, buy things I don't need in mass quantities, have a custom cake made, purchase a car (and new tires and fill it up with gas) and plan a vacation.  For anyone who's never been, I'm not kidding about any of the above. $55 annually buys you access to a world you've never seen. I remember going to Coscto with my parents as a kid. Back then, there was a hot dog cart out front, and they didn't offer anything inside other than bulk food and a few odds and ends.   Now you walk in and it's sensory overload. There are 350 TVs, samples everywhere, and it takes a long time to walk around and see everything. It's a good way to burn off the hot dog you're guaranteed to eat, so you can still fit into the jeans your guaranteed to buy (you know, because they're such a good price).  Also, if you buy too much for a regular cart, you can shop with a pallet cart. It's the ultimate bad ass move to shop with one of those. I haven't graduated to that level yet...   Costco is an experience, for sure. And I love it.

Had a really nice Thanksgiving dinner here. It was awesome that they were open for one, and the food and service were very good. I had the filet, my wife had the prefix Thanksgiving dinner, and we each had a couple of drinks. I finished the meal off with some amazing Creme Brûlée.   It's not the absolute best steak I've ever had, nor are they the best sides, but it's a really, really solid meal, and the drinks were impeccable. I personally feel like their 500 degree plates take a medium rare steak and turn it into near medium when you're about halfway through it. I almost wished I'd ordered it rare or rare+.  All told, I'd rather go to Flemings or City Hall, but Ruth's Chris is also a very good option, and you won't be disappointed in your meal.

While I've been to both Houston's and Bandera multiple times, last night was my first visit to Hillstone, the umbrella responsible for all of them.   Let's just say I'll be hard pressed to go anywhere but Hillstone from now on.   There was a wait, so we started on the outdoor patio for a drink. The outdoor space is really amazing. Cool lights, unique furniture and overall a great ambiance. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan rocks, and the drink was perfect...So often Manhattans are "over Vermouthed", this one was the perfect blend and let the Whiskey speak for itself...Even the ice cubes looked cool.   The restaurant is large, spacious and has a cool design. It's very Frank Lloyd Wright esque. We sat at a booth toward the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen and prep bar. Service was prompt and friendly, as I've come to expect at any Hillstone restaurant.  As for the food, it was delicious. As a table, we ordered the Hawaiian rib eye x2 (ridiculous, mine was a perfect medium rare and delicious), the French Dip and the Prime rib. All meals were well received, even the salads were delicious. The menu is really similar to Houston's (read: nearly identical), so you know what you're getting into.  It's not cheap, but it's absolutely worth it. Hillstone is on my list for a return trip, ASAP.

The service from AccuTemp from start to finish was amazing. Around 6pm I got a hold of their after hours dispatch, and by 8pm the tech had arrived, left, and the issue was fixed. Given that it was after hours and a holiday weekend, the price was also very fair.   I'd definitely recommend AccuTemp to anyone with an A/C issue. Fast, fair, and honest, with great service to go along with it.

A little surprised by all of the great reviews here, as I was very underwhelmed. Maybe I was in on a bad day? Came for lunch, and found the chinese food to be mediocre at best. The Orange chicken I had was really bad, so dry it kind of broke apart and separated when I would cut it. I also tried the sesame chicken, mongolian beef and sweet and sour pork. Some of the flavors were okay, but all of the meat felt like it was overcooked. Maybe that was just the constant reheating from a buffet style. I didn't get seconds of anything, and while I felt bad about it, I didn't completely finish anything that I took.  I don't like sushi, so I didn't try that station, and no one was working the mongolian grill style area, so that wasn't an option. For what I had, I found it disappointing, and at $11+ a drink, tax and tip, it's not cheap enough to be worth it. Service was fine, and the restaurant seemed clean, which is a plus.  It may well float other people's boats, but Hong Kong Gourmet Buffet is not for me.

I have a long history with Flemings...We go way back. Seattle, Washington, high school Senior Prom dinner. Yeah...That far back. That location is now closed, but I digress. When I moved to Scottsdale, I was excited immediately because there were multiple Flemings locations. It quickly became my go to special occasion dinner option, as my wife loves it as well.   In short, the food is phenomenal. I've had multiple cuts of steak there and different preparations and they're all amazing. Last time I had a 6oz Filet that was stuffed with jumbo lump crab...Just let that sink in for a minute. Their sides and salads are also really nicely done, and their wine list and bar is one of the best out there. They also have a very good happy hour which is a pretty well kept secret. It's 5 items for $6 until 7pm Monday through Friday, and they also have $6 glasses of wine and cocktails as well.   Obviously the food should be great, but the thing that sets Flemings apart for me is the service and commitment to quality. A brief story, if I may...  In July of 2011 I made reservations for my wedding anniversary. We got to the restaurant and were seated, everything started out fine. It took longer than usual to get the bread course and to get our order taken, and since it was a Wednesday night it was a little surprising. Everything was taking forever, but the biggest disappointment was the food. I ordered a New York peppercorn steak medium rare. When it came, it was well done. Brown inside and tough...I sent it back and they were apologetic for the mistake. It took nearly 20 minutes for me to get my second steak (my wife was done eating hers by this time), and while it was still overcooked for my liking, it was edible. The rest of the service continued to take way longer than necessary, the waitress wasn't attentive, and at the end of the meal, there was an issue with the bill that took another 15 minutes to resolve. It took nearly 3 hours (and not in a good way) from start to finish, and was not a good dining experience in the least.  I ended up writing Flemings the next day to express my disappointment, because it was a special occasion, and I'd never before been unhappy with the food or service I received. Within 24 hours, I had an email from the President of the company saying that he was very sorry and he'd have the GM of the restaurant reach out to me to amend any issues. The next day I got a call from the GM Mike Head and we chatted for a few minutes about our experience. He too apologized and asked me for my address so he could send something to make it right. Two days later I had a letter with a business card and a note saying "please call me personally to arrange your next reservation", along with $150 in gift certificates. I was floored.  We've since returned a few times, and the food and service was back to it's absolute best. You will rarely, if ever, see business done like this, and it's the reason I'm happy to keep Flemings as my special occasion go to.

Hadn't been to Houston's in a while, but ended up there last night for dinner.   After the meal we were wondering why we didn't go more often...  Houston's is delicious...It's in the Hillstone family, so it's like Bandera with a larger menu and less of a southwestern flair. Probably my favorite Caesar salad right now, great sides and their burgers and ribs are amazing.  Last night, I had the Hickory burger and a caesar, while my wife had a salad and a baked potato. Both of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals, and the service was impeccable.  Seems like the service really sets Houston's apart from a lot of other restaurants. My water glass would be close to empty, and then all of a sudden I'd look over and it would be full...They must hire food and water ninjas that sneak up on you and provide great service. I'm not complaining.  I've yet to order a steak there, but I hear they're good. There are a lot of other places that I'd rather order a steak though, so I think I'll stick to my standbys.    4 stars because it's always a wait...Always. I know, I know, it's not Houston's fault, it's the fault of the country club snowbirds that park their range rovers and make me jealous that I don't have that kind of money. Kidding...Sort of. Seriously though, if you go on a Wednesday at 4:30pm, expect to wait 10 minutes. Lunch can be a 15-20 minute wait usually and peak dinner times can be 30-45 minutes. Houston's does take reservations, so if you're planning on going there for dinner, it's best to call at least an hour ahead and make a reservation.   If you've yet to dine at Houston's, do it ASAP. If you haven't been in a while, go back. Highly recommend.

Amazeballs. That's French for something good, right?  It's not...It's English for freaking amazing, which is the best way I could possibly describe Zinc Bistro. Top to bottom, a fantastic meal.  Started with Duck pate, my wife had a salad,  we each had the flat iron steak at the recommendation of the server, and we shared a chocolate souffle for dessert.  Going piece by piece...Salad was very good, fresh greens, vinaigrette and a warm chevre crouton that was delicious. The duck pate was very flavorful and rich, served with marbled rye bread, an herb infused creme fraiche, cornichon, and some sort of meat gelee (which weirded me out). That was a dynamite appetizer, incredibly rich and satisfying.   Our flat iron steaks were cooked to medium rare perfection, pepper crusted, and finished with a red wine reduction and shallots, which created an awesome sauce to dip the pomme frites that came with the steak. Special shout out to the chef(s) at Zinc, the steaks were really cooked perfectly. So often even at really top end steak houses, medium rare can mean medium. This was not the case at Zinc, which I appreciated. Pomme frites were great, crispy and flavorful, and were awesome when dipped in the sauce.  The souffle to finish was incredible. You get your choice of a finishing sauce (we chose chocolate), so you get the cakey exterior, warm, soft interior, molten center and then the sauce that pairs well with the whole thing. A wonderful way to cap the meal.  I had a Manhattan after dinner that was good, service was very good, timely and attentive, with spot recommendations as well. I also love the atmosphere at Zinc. They do a nice job making it feel Parisian (without the smoking and the judgement...I kid, France...I kid).  All in all a wonderful meal, and I am sure to be back to Zinc soon!

Ugh...I've been on a losing streak lately while getting lunch. Tried Applebee's for lunch on Tuesday. I hadn't been to one in years, and figured "why not"?  I should have asked myself "why"?  Service was pretty good, hence the two stars. They have a "14 minute guarantee" so that once you place your order, they guarantee you'll have food in 14 minutes or it's free.  The food was out within that time frame, I assume...I didn't have a stopwatch out but it seemed quick enough. I wish they'd taken longer to make it good. I could put some crappy chicken on a plate at home in under 14 minutes, but I pay someone else to do it in hopes that out will turn out better. It didn't. It was worse. Overcooked boneless wings that were overly breaded and tossed in poorly flavored sauce...Pretty much a swing and a miss all around.   Also overpriced for what you get...It's simply not worth it at all. If you ever find yourself in this "neighborhood" (see what I did there?), just drive on by.  I need to find the Applebee's that John Corbett has been going to...Until then I think I'll pass on a second trip to this place.

Was here for a wedding a week ago, great wedding, with a really picturesque setting. Quite beautiful at night.   Service was good, the venue was very cool and the food was quite good as well, which is rare for wedding catering. I can't talk much about the hotel itself, but everything came together really nicely. Bar service at the wedding was very good, and they had a huge selection of beer, wine and liquor which is always nice. The made to order pasta bar was a nice touch.  For a wedding venue, it seems like an awesome place, and if I had family or friends visiting that wanted a nice place to stay, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Buttes.  I hope I have a reason to come back here at some point, especially if it's a night event so I can see that view again.

I had a flight booked for me to go to training for a new job...When I learned that I would be flying US Airways I was not thrilled in the least. I've flown US Air a few times, some personal (including my honeymoon) and twice for business.   For this trip I checked in online and had boarding passes sent to my phone. I don't check bags with US Air (more on this later), and I wanted nothing to do with their "customer service staff". With me I had a carry on suitcase and a garment bag. As I boarded the first flight, I asked if they could hang my garment bag for me. Every airline I've ever traveled on has a place in the front to hang a bag like this. Not US Air. The lady said "are you in 1st class?" I said no. "Well if you're not in first class, we won't hang it for you. You'll need to put it under your seat because this is a full flight." OK...No worries, as I love a wrinkly suit. Other than that there wasn't much notable about the flight. (Side note: if you have a smart phone, you should 100% do mobile tickets every time you fly...Life changing.)  Rewind a few years, to two really awful experiences. First, we flew US Airways to Jamaica from Portland, OR in August of 2008. This was the height of terrible fuel prices and a recession, and US Air wouldn't let you forget it. $30 per checked bag, and they were charging $2.00 for sodas on the plane. TWO DOLLARS FOR A SODA? I'm paying out the ass for a ticket and my bags, and you're going to charge me $2 for what should be a free Sprite? I went thirsty in silent protest of such horrible business practices.  In addition, a couple years ago I flew US Air on business and they lost my bag on the return flight. I returned late on a Friday night and didn't have my bag until Sunday...The service at the airport and over the phone was really atrocious. I know that lost baggage people have the worst jobs on earth, but there wasn't even a hint of compassion or "hey sorry we messed up". That's why I'll never check bags with them again, and also because I don't trust them to keep my belongings safe...  I will never, ever voluntarily fly US Air. I'll happily pay more just to avoid them. Do not recommend.

Who would have thought a place this nice would be in Mesa? (Sorry, city of Mesa)  Saw fun. here a couple weeks ago, and it was the perfect venue for a show. Great sound, lighting, good space, comfortable seats...Big enough to have a lot of energy but not so big that you feel like you are in a sea of people.   It's not the place for you if you want a crazy, mosh pit atmosphere, but I'm an old man now, and I've outgrown my mosh pit days.   The space has high ceilings, and touches like acoustic tiles, that make it a really versatile venue. You could see a rock show, or a symphony, and the main hall is well equipped to handle it all.   The show was incredible, fun. is amazing live, so that helped too, but I would happily return to this venue for a concert, classical, rock or anything in between.

I've only been to Roaring Fork once, but I enjoyed my experience there.   I had a bacon wrapped pork tenderloin that was delicious. My wife had a trout dish that she thought as alright, but she really liked the green chile and pork appetizer. We sat outside on the patio on a cool evening and it made for a really nice ambiance. Service was very attentive and the prices were reasonable considering the quality and portions of the food. I definitely want to return to try their Big Ass burger. I love burgers and with a name like that, I've got to order it at least once.  Location is a little weird, at the bottom of an office building off Scottsdale road, but once you find it you'll be glad you did.

I love Bandera. I was there on Sunday for a birthday dinner with some friends and I left asking my wife: "Why don't we come here more?"  Bandera is part of Hillstone, so it is like Houstons in a way. I prefer Bandera due to the smaller, seasonal menu and the smaller, more intimate feel to the restaurant. On Sunday, I had the ribs, my wife had the lamb (a special item that night), and both were delicious. The table got the cornbread to start (amazing), and we finished with their banana cream pie (UH-Mazing). The rest of the sides, salads and entrees that we ordered were very good as well.   Every time I've been there the service has been spot on, the cocktails are good and the food is consistently great. I'll probably end up here again within a week or two.   Highly recommend.

I'm at this Trader Joe's quite often. I love being able to walk in and get a couple of really good dinners for the next couple nights, and not feel like I have to buy $100 worth of stuff in the process. Their wine selection is great and reasonably priced, and they offer some hard to find cheeses and other things you won't find at your average grocery store.  Their frozen section is the jam. There are great options for quick meals and cool frozen desserts which can be great for entertaining (or just pigging out).  It can be really busy at times, and when it is, it will take you a while to navigate the store and check out. While a lot of things are a good value, some things at TJs are overpriced. There are certain things that you are better off getting at a traditional grocery store, which can be frustrating if one stop shopping is your goal. Occasionally, the cashiers will try talk your ear off, but it's alright because they're being friendly. It's much better than the blank stare you get at some stores...You know the one, the "I'm judging all your purchases while scanning them over the beepy thing and just hoping deep down inside that you don't question a price or tell me that something was on sale"...That look.  For all those reasons (and likely numerous others), Trader Joe's is great. Definitely recommend.

Buying a car at a dealership has a terrible reputation. In most cases, that reputation is well deserved. At Mark Kia however, I had a great experience buying a car.  I test drove the 2012 Kia Optima SX two weeks ago. Loved the car...Scott, the sales guy was awesome; knowledgeable and nice. It wasn't super high pressure, and even though we ran some numbers, he understood that I wasn't going to make a decision that day, and we kept in touch. I gave him my cell number, and he kept in touch over the next week or so, even texting me a week later with a more attractive offer. He was never intrusive, but always helpful...That's rare in a car salesman.  Two weeks after my initial test drive I brought my wife back to the dealership and found Scott. He remembered me by name, and let me know that he kept hiding the car I was looking at so they wouldn't put it out front. The three of us drove it, we liked what we saw, so we decided to talk numbers and try to get something done. Scott facilitated (nice way of saying "middle man between us and the boss") all the negotiations, and after a while we landed on a price we liked, so we went for it.  Here's the thing: It took a pretty long time. If you don't want to pay sticker price for a car, plan on negotiating for a while...It's part of the game of buying a car. The entire process took a couple hours, which really isn't too bad all things considered.   The amenities that come with getting a car here are very attractive. Gap insurance was included, Mark Kia will pay your insurance deductible if you use them for accident repair work, they detailed the car and put in a full tank of gas before we drove it away, and we get free maintenance for a year and $19.99 oil changes for the life of the vehicle. It's those little things along the way that make it a better experience.   If you're looking for a car (the Optima is awesome, btw), head over to Mark Kia and check some out. You'll get great service, and you'll probably be pleasantly surprised by the cars.

2 stars because it's cheap. Other than that, it was the worst meal I've had in a while...  Tried this place for lunch last week. I'm still getting over the separation anxiety from being so far away from my favorite Chinese spot. It was walking distance from my last office, but too far away now to do for lunch...It's been a challenge for me, but I'm working through it. So anyway, I come here with a coworker and we sit down. The place is pretty busy, which seemed like a good sign. It took a while to get our order taken, but once we did, the food was out in a matter of minutes. Not a good sign.  I ordered the kung pao chicken...It was awful. There is just no other way to say it. Wet, gross chicken drenched in a bland sauce with listless vegetables and clumpy white rice. Terrible.   Here's the thing: My dish was $5. The tab for the two of us was $12 with tax, so it's really, really cheap. Of course, you pay a pretty dear price later with the way you feel...  I will never come back. Ever. But, if you're looking for really cheap, really crappy Chinese food, this is an option that you could try. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I did.

If I was 60 years old and rich, I'd give Tommy Bahama 5 stars...That is the it crowd at Tommy.  With that said, I like it here a lot. The food is good and reasonably priced, the desserts are great and the service and ambiance are very nice.   I've been here a few times, most recently for NYE. On New Years, there was a live band outside, complete with dancing Kierland Cougars. It was a really fun environment, in all seriousness, and it added some nice before and after dinner entertainment.  Food is very good. They offer a whole leaf Caesar salad, which just feels classier to me than the regular option. You get bread with delicious butter, and they have a full bar and great drink menu. When I'm there, I get the Sanibel Chicken for my entree. It's a Parmesan crusted chicken breast, stuffed with herb cheese, then it's pan fried and finished with a red pepper cream sauce. It's just as good as it sounds, and comes with a chive whipped potato and a vegetable (I prefer asparagus). My wife had the ribs and thought the sauce was good but the ribs themselves were a little fatty.  I've had the chocolate cake and the pina colada cake, both are delicious. Word to the wise: Order the "small" size of your cake. The large is more or less a whole cake...My chocolate cake from Saturday would have fed a family of 6.  I'm sure I'll be back soon enough with a hunger for that sanibel chicken.

Came to AZ88 with some friends for dinner last Monday. It's really challenging to find, as it's tucked away with a sign that's nearly impossible to see from the street. We finally found it after calling to make sure we weren't lost, and there is a really cool outdoor area in front as you walk in. If it was warmer we probably would have eaten outside, but it was a bit chilly, so we opted to eat inside.  We started at the bar for drinks and an appetizer. The drinks were all really good, well crafted and tasty. My Manhattan was just right, and the other people in my party enjoyed their drinks as well. We shared a two appetizers, the dipping fries and bacon wrapped water chestnuts. Both were delicious, though in fairness, you can wrap anything in bacon and it will be amazing.  After some time at the bar, we moved to a table and had dinner. I ordered a peppercorn crusted burger with waffle fries. It sounds great, and it was. "Mmmmmmm! That IS a tasty burger!" Two others ordered the same burger (high marks all around), and one ordered a giant salad that looked really good.  Overall the service was good, the drinks were good and the good was good. A successful meal. Ambiance was also nice, and the bathrooms are straight out of a Vegas night club...Very posh.  If you can find it, I definitely recommend.

Rest assured, if you need anything and you're in Scottsdale, you can find what you're looking for at Fashion Square Mall. This place is larger than most suburban cities, and probably has an operating budget that would make a congressman blush.   If you look at it from a store perspective, this mall is 5 stars. They have every store you can think of. Ferragamo, for instance. While most malls have one store with a small selection of Ferragamo, Fashion Square has an entire store dedicated Salvatore and his fine leather goods (Treat yo self!). Same goes for 7 For All Mankind denim...The list goes on. Fashion Square also features a Neiman-Marcus, Barney's Tiffany, pretty much every high end store there is. For those of you that don't make $500,000+ per year, there are also lower cost options like H&M, and middle of the road options like Nordstrom.  In addition to a ton of stores, there are 6-8 full service, sit down restaurants in addition to the food court and a movie theatre. If they were to let you sleep at Crate and Barrel, you'd never need to leave this mall.   In terms of downsides...Parking isn't great, and when the mall is busy, it's packed. Even with three stories and hundreds of thousands of square feet, it still feels like a sea of people that you're trying to fight through. Also, it's so damn big that you're constantly fear that you're going to get lost. I've probably been to this mall 30 times and I'm confident that there are 100+ stores that I've yet to stumble upon.   Additional Note: If you're planning a flash mob and think the mall might be a good spot, just move on. Fashion Square is NOT kind to people flashmobbing in their area.

Bungalow is one of my favorite lunch spots in Old Town. The food is good and there's always ample seating indoors and out, so you'll never wait. The menu is pretty diverse, but their home runs are the Americana options: Chicken strips and grilled cheese. The fries are delicious...Some of the best I've had. Not all the menu is great, and some of the true entree options are a bit overpriced. I wouldn't spend $20 per person on bar food, but perhaps others would.   Here's the thing that makes me love Bungalow: The service is amazing. Because I'm here pretty often for lunch, we always sit in the same section and the same server 90% of the time. She remembers drink orders from visit to visit, as well as food favorites, etc. It's a touch that you don't get at most bar and grill type of places, and it makes me love going to Bungalow.   The happy hour is also good, with a lot of those favorites available cheaper with good drink specials as well.   I can understand why people might be disappointed here if they order steak or fish here (I never have), but if you come to Bungalow and stick to the basics, you're bound to leave satisfied.

Edit: I'm a terrible person, this update took way too long. A manager reached out to me and made the situation right. I've been back a couple times since and had good experiences. I do love beer, so it's hard to not love Yard House.   -  It's overall a meh experience. Service can be good or poor, food is OK, happy hour pricing is pretty good. The selection of draught beer is really impressive, and worth coming for alone.   It's a typical sports bar/grill type setup, large bar in the middle of the space, lots of TVs. It's a fine place to catch a game, but you'll have better luck with food, service and price at a few other places around town.  Last time I was here for HH, we had a table of probably 12 people, with napkin setups for about 9 people. Someone who looked like a manager walked by and asked if everything was going well. I asked for a few napkins for the people at the table that didn't have any (including myself). He walked away and brought back 7-8 tiny cocktail napkins. That was weird, not to mention unhelpful, and a pretty good way for me to sum up my experience there.

I'm a fan of essence Bakery Café. I'm typically here for pastries, so I can't speak to much else, but they do pastries right. Their Chocolate croissant is ridiculous...So good. You can really tell they use high quality chocolate, which makes all the difference. I am also quite partial to their almond croissant. It's quite delicious. I've had a full hot breakfast there once and thought it was pretty good, and I've yet to try Essence for lunch.  Their traditional croissants and other pastries are great, as are some of their desserts. I've tried their macaroons and found them to be just OK, while very expensive. Maybe I need to revisit them, but the last couple time's they haven't been worth the money. Essence in general is pricey, but it's worth it when you're sticking to their highlights.   One thing to note: Get there early, especially on weekends. They tend to run out of the really popular stuff quickly, and nothing is worse than showing up too late. You'd think they'd just bake more of their really popular offerings, but who knows...  Overall Essence has some great baked goods. Definitely a must visit if you're in Tempe and craving a European feel to your breakfast.

I like Chandler Fashion Center. From a shopping perspective, it's got a lot of good stores. It's not to the snobby extreme that Scottsdale Fashion Square is (there aren't 50 different places to valet your car), but it has a nice set of stores and some good restaurant options.   I enjoy coming here more than Scottsdale because it's easier to park, generally less busy, and it's more spread out so it doesn't always feel so crowded. It's a very different clientele (read: old people), so it moves a bit slower, and there are fewer stores that bump techno music.   Other than that, it's a mall. It's clean and well lit (noted by a couple of other reviewers), and features a nice mix of good shopping and dining. It's a really convenient location overall because you're also close to a Target and a Costco, so if you end up here you could really eat and shop all day...Funny enough, those are two of my favorite things to do, much to the chagrin of my wallet and my waistline.  If you're anywhere close, it should be your mall of choice. Even if it's a bit of a trek, it's worth the trip and will definitely keep you entertained yet not overwhelmed for a number of hours.

Since they made these theatres "AMC Dine-In" theatres, it's my favorite place in the Phoenix area to see a movie. It's nice, upscale and you pick your own seats.  The stadium theatres are the way to go. They're large, with huge, motorized reclining seats and walls in front of you and behind you. You can't see anyone behind you or in front of you, and you can't really see or hear anyone in your row, save for the person/people next to you. You get a dedicated server who will bring you anything from a soda to movie candy to spinach dip. There is also a full bar, so that's a plus. I haven't had a full meal there, but I've had a dessert (which was good), and service is attentive while being surprisingly unobtrusive.   The smaller theatres are still good, just not as secluded. I absolutely hate hearing people talk during movies, and I don't like children in the theatre, so the larger spaces are my favorite, since you can't really see/hear anyone and you have to be 21+ to see a movie in the stadium areas.   It's not as swanky as iPic, which feels like a nightclub in Vegas, but it's much cheaper ($12 per ticket for smaller theatres, $15 for stadium), and you get the wait staff here as well.  Totally recommend, I know I'll be back soon.

D'lish can be hit and miss, but when it's a hit, it is soooo good. I love their breakfast sandwhiches, and they usually have really good coffee. It gets really busy on the weekends, so prepare to wait a while if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning. If you ever drive by on the weekend and don't see a line, you owe it to yourself to pull off and get something to eat.   I typically get their egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and I'll add either bacon or chicken sausage. My wife loves the croissant sandwich, which has egg, cheese, tomato, bacon and pesto. We'll also typically get coffees or a blended protein drink or something.   It's a great place to come for breakfast and coffee, but at times, the wait is really long, and the food/service can suffer when it's really busy. I'll continue to go there pretty much every weekend. Highly recommend.

Firebirds is pretty awesome. The food is good, the service is good and the ambiance is nice. There are moose heads on the walls and ridiculously high ceilings, so it's got that "Classy Elks Club Hunting Lodge" type feel to it...It's really open, yet cozy.  I like the wood grilled options on the menu (go figure), and their grilled chicken is especially delicious.  The ranch rings are um...stupid good. They are my favorite onion rings ever, and they're accompanied by the best ranch ever. So, it's pretty safe to assume that I recommend you try them if you like rings (and who doesn't like rings???). I also really like their salads, which you'll need to start eating more of if you order the ranch rings. Their ribs are also very good, and they make a pretty good burger as well.  The only downside here is that it's retiree central in this place. I don't know what it is about Firebirds, but old people flock to this place like it's Pensacola, Florida in November. If you dine here, get ready to wait for a little while and plan to stub your toe on a walker or two...  In all seriousness, respect the your elders...Also, Firebirds is a great place to get lunch or dinner. Highly recommend.

I have a DSW problem...In the last 6 weeks I've bought 6 pairs of shoes, all from DSW. I'm one trip away from a shoeaholics anonymous meeting.  The Chandler DSW is big...Great selection, and the prices are great. Specifically, the clearance section is awe inspiring. A lot of the shoes I've bought have been off the clearance rack, with deep discounts (40-60%). The staff is friendly and helpful, and they're willing to go the extra mile if need be. I really loved a certain color scheme in some Nike runners that they didn't have, so they called around to all their other stores, found one, had it put on hold and it was waiting for me when I got there. That's service that's not typically associated with a store featuring the word "Warehouse" in their name.  They carry popular brands (Nike, Puma, Cole Haan, Creative Recreation, Penguin), as well as some random brands that you won't find everywhere. I got a great pair of grey suede slip ons from a label I've never heard of, but they're awesome and comfortable. It's all you can ask for.  I recommend going, but you better just start writing a DSW line into your monthly budget. Go once and you'll be back.

Sprinkles cupcakes are very good. They're too expensive and at peak times you'll wait for a while, but they're very tasty. Like them on Facebook and you'll get a daily secret word that will score you a free cupcake when you're in the neighborhood. The people that work there are friendly, and for as tiny of a space it is, they do a pretty good job of getting people in and moving them through a line.   I like their Red Velvet, Black & White and Milk Chocolate cupcakes, and they have some other, crazier flavor combinations if you're into that kind of thing. They have seasonal flavors and certain cupcakes which they only have on certain days, which is kinda cool. If you're into good frosting (which I am), you'll like Sprinkles a lot. The frosting is delicious.  If you're in Scottsdale and you like cupcakes, check Sprinkles out. It's fun to overpay for cupcakes (but at least they'll be good cupcakes) and get a taste of the Scottsdale tourist scene.

Edit - Hand and Stone reached out immediately and fixed the situation. They ended up not taking enough off of the bill the day of, so they refunded me additional money, and offered our next service at member prices. They apologized for the misunderstanding as well. Bumping to 4 stars and am grateful for quick resolution!  I've had a few experiences here and most have been really pleasant, but my last experience left something to be desired. I received an email offering a "Black Friday" special, which was buy one get one off services. I called and booked an 80 minute couples massage, and the person over the phone told me it would be essentially two for the price of one.   We checked in a few minutes early, got our massages (which were great), and then on checkout, I was quoted a price that was double my earlier quote. I was told "there was a note on your account that we needed to follow up with you on". Apparently the BOGO was only for 50 minute services, not 80 minute services. I checked the email, and in the fine print, this was indeed the case, but still...To not be told over the phone when booking, and to not be told when I checked in early...To wait until we were already done with our services just felt shady to me. They put a "free" 50 minute service toward the tab, which took $40 off. The math didn't entirely make sense, but I was already frustrated and didn't want to deal with it.   It's too bad, because until that point I'd had great experiences at Hand and Stone. It wasn't that they were wrong on their pricing, or that I felt it was over priced (I don't think it was), it was simply the fact that they had 3 days to verify the actual price with me and "follow up on that note", but they waited until I had my card in my hand waiting to pay.

Tempe Marketplace is pretty great. There are a lot of good food options (and some laughably bad food options), a decent mix of stores and boutiques and a really nice movie theatre. I live close by so I'm around pretty often, whether it's to grab a quick bite, hit up the Target or do some shopping.  If you're expecting a mall, you'll be disappointed. It doesn't offer the department stores and options that a full fledged shopping mall does, but it has some options that you won't see at a mall (Best Buy, Pier 1, Old Navy, Cost Plus World Imports).   There are good fast and slow food options, including The Keg, Red Robin, Smashburger, Lucille's BBQ, CPK, Paradise Bakery and Chipotle. There are bad restaurants too, so there are places to avoid (Cadillac Ranch, Darcy McGee's). There's also a Dave and Busters if you have 3 hours to waste and want to play some games.   It's really nice to be able to park and walk around outside and shop when it's not too hot. You can also kill an entire day here if you want to, with lunch, shopping, a movie and then dinner. You've got options for stuff to do, and enough shopping to keep you happy.

There are a few options on their menu that I love, so it takes Grand Lux from 3 stars to 4. The Bacon Cheeseburger is unreal (they add lardon, which is like French bacon, and stupid delicious), and I love the chicken and waffles on their weekend brunch menu. My wife likes the pot roast and the salmon picatta.    If you like the Cheesecake Factory, you'll think Grand Lux is pretty good. Overall, I'd rather go to Cheesecake Factory (if not for the desserts alone), because I feel like their entire menu is stronger. Lux does offer baked to order desserts, which are very good. Their lava cake and beignets are both baked to order and delicious.  The interior is spacious, and it's so big that there's rarely a wait, which is a plus. There is bar seating, dining room seating and patio seating, so you've got your choice of ambiance. Service is always good, which makes a huge difference in my book. I like the convenience of Grand Lux a lot. It's at the mall, so it's a really good option when you're out shopping.   If you're looking for a large, diverse menu and a good option while you're at the mall, I'd definitely recommend Grand Lux, especially if you love a good burger.

Saddle Ranch can be fun...It can also be frustrating. I've been to Saddle for lunch a number of times, and if you're in a group of more than 4, plan for a 2 hour lunch extravaganza. It's that slow.   There are some good menu options. I think their Cajun burger is good, I've had breakfast there once that I thought was alright, and they offer cheap/bottomless bloody mary's or mimosas during breakfast and lunch. I think the food is overpriced, and the plates they serve on are so unnecessarily, comically large that it doesn't leave much room on your table for the essentials like napkins and silverware. My guess is that they want you to have that "outdoor cookin' on giant wooden plates" kind of experience, which would make sense if they weren't in the heart of Old Town...Seeing a Ferrari packed with cougars driving by doesn't scream "outdoor cookin'".   I rode the bull here one night, and while I don't really remember it, apparently it was hilarious. If I did things like that more often, I might rate Saddle a lot higher. Unfortunately, I can only go on what I know, which is typically a lunch with OK food and service that takes twice as long as it should. The weirdest part to me is that the service for a group of 5+ is slow even when the restaurant looks otherwise empty. I kept giving Saddle another chance (8 chances in total, apparently), but I kept getting disappointed.  If you've got time to kill, Saddle is an OK lunch option. If you've got an hour for lunch, you're better off going elsewhere.

The Phoenix open is a really good time, and 75% of it comes down to the 16th hole.   For those that haven't been: It's a short par 3 that is fully enclosed by grandstand seating. It seats a lot of people, and it's very rowdy and VERY loud. It is the least traditional golf environment you could imagine, and it's a lot of fun.  Upon teeing off, the players are met with either rousing cheers or loud boos, depending on where their tee shots land. The crowd screams at the caddies, trying to get them to sprint up onto the green. If they ever do, the crowd goes wild. If there's a great shot, the crowd goes wild. Some golfers throw gear into the crowd, and they go wild. The moral of the story here is that it's wild.   There are private areas and spaces for corporate sponsors, which would be the way to be here, if you can find a way in. When I come back next year, I'll likely spend the vast majority of my time at the 16th hole. It's so much fun, and also a drunken shit show with all the lushes around you.  Some advice...Get here early, because they'll start running a line. While it's worth the wait to get in, you'll enjoy it more if you don't have to wait. Also, bring/wear sunblock, because regardless of where you sit, you'll be in the sun pretty much all day.

It's just not a great theatre. I love going to the movies, but these theatres are small (in terms of number of screens), old, and uninspiring. I'm a snob when it comes to movies. I'm happy to pay $12-16 a ticket for a great experience. Harkins Fashion Square 7 just doesn't get it done for me. It's shocking really, being in Fashion Square, a beacon of class and high end shopping, to have a pretty lame theatre in the middle of the food court.   A plus side is that the theatres are huge, so even for a big event (opening day of Avengers), there is ample seating.  I'd come back with a big group if that was the only option, but I don't anticipate being back too soon.

Who doesn't love Red Robin?  This location is really close to my house, so it's great for those quick dinners when you don't feel like cooking (and lets be honest, that's all the time).  The burgers and chicken tenders (clucks) are usually really good, and the fries are delicious and bottomless. I especially love the A1 Peppercorn Burger and the Buffalo Clucks. Sometimes it can be busy and loud with kids and the service can be slow during those times, but it's always a good place for a quick bite.

It's a chain, but a pretty good one...  I've eaten at this Keg a few times, but there was a Keg back home north of Seattle that we'd go for special occasion family dinners sometimes, so The Keg has always held a special place in my heart.   You'll get a very good meal here. Not to the level of a Fleming's or Morton's, and not even close to a City Hall experience, but you also don't pay anything close to what you pay at those places, which is nice. Two people can have a nice dinner and a glass of wine each and get out for $75 + tax and tip. I typically get the filet meal with a Caesar salad and twice baked potato. They also have good ribs, and my wife had the prime rib once and seemed to like it.   The "Keg Dinners" are the way to go, since they're all under $30 and come with a steak, a side and a salad. None of the a la carte stuff that kills you at other steakhouses.  Service is always attentive, even if you sit in the bar area, which makes that a nice option when it's a 45 minute wait. The drinks are good, and their desserts are tasty and well priced. We've had the creme brulee a few times, and it's quite good.  It's really close to where we live, so we're here occasionally. There are better steakhouses out there, but The Keg is a really good one for the money.

Really, really like J Alexander's. I was introduced to J's by a good friend that worked there quite a while back, and it became one of my go to dinner spots after that.   Like others, I'd probably compare J's to Houston's, but I love that J's features a more diverse menu. You've got way more options, and pretty much all of the options are good. They switch the menu up pretty often, which can be good and bad (RIP Steak and Fries - Best $19 steak I've ever had), but they also bring back some favorites as well (Helloooo, Jack's Crispy Chicken Platter). The classics are all good - They have really good salads, their burgers are great and the entrees I've had were also really good.  The ambiance is nice inside and the service has always been good, whether in the dining room or at the bar. I like the look of this place a lot, from the wine area to the bar to the really cool bathrooms. As a general rule, Scottsdale has really nice bathrooms...  I'm giving 4 stars because the prices have gone up in the last few months, they've stopped offering their pimento cheese dip at the bar (which was amazing), and they no longer offer the crescent rolls with dinner anymore. It's little stuff, you know? Regardless, I'll still come to J's often because it always seems to hit the spot.

In a word, Tuck Shop is: Awesome.   If you just drove by, surely you'd miss it (I know, I know, I shouldn't call you Shirley). It's tucked away, no pun intended, so you've got to be looking out for it, but you'll thank yourself once you walk in.    It's small and cozy inside, with about 15 tables and a full bar. The decor and ambiance is like a 50s/60s house. The waiting area is cool, it's like a living room...Nice touch. No reservations for parties under six, so if you're in a party of five or fewer, prepare to wait for 20-30 minutes for a table. I was there on a Wednesday at 7pm with a party of four and we waited about 20 minutes. A plus side is that they'll come around and take drink and appetizer orders so you can eat and drink a bit while you wait.  For dinner, I had the chicken and waffles. Um...Amazing. The waffles were savory, with cheddar and some herbs, and the chicken was juicy. My wife had the fish and chips, which she liked but didn't love. Our table also had the Mac and Cheese, Pork Tenderloin, Brussels Sprouts and Cheese Curds. I didn't personally love the Mac and Cheese, but I thought everything else was really good.    Service was attentive, always around if you need something but not hanging around. One of the best things about Tuck Shop is the prices...Our tab top to bottom with 4 entrees, apps and wine was around $110 for the four of us. More than reasonable for the quality of food.   I'll definitely be back.

The Lodge has been a pretty consistent happy hour spot for me over the last year and a half. Their food and drink specials are a great way to wrap up the week on a Friday night. I like their chicken strips and the cheese curds are great. The pretzels are also delicious. Service is typically pretty good, you'll be able to keep drinks coming and food comes out quickly. There's a lot of entertainment there, with corn hole and giant jenga outside, and some video games and a pool table inside.   I don't love the Lodge as much for a prime time or late night spot...It gets a lot more expensive and a lot more crowded. Go for happy hour, order some cheese curds and a $3 Miller Lite and you're bound to have a good time. The decor is kinda fun, there are random acts of taxidermy inside and it's very, uh...Log cabin like.  A funny (but pretty well known) fact about this place is that Jared Allen (Minnesota Vikings) is a part owner of The Lodge, so from time to time you may run into him and some other NFLers there.

Daily Dose has one of my favorite happy hours in Scottsdale. It runs from 4-8pm and offers great drink and food specials. In addition to their happy hour menu, they offer $2 off burgers and some other menu items from 4-8, so it ends up being a great dinner place as well. They have a couple of great menu items (including their burger and steak salad), and they have a chipotle ranch that is to die for.   It's really busy for lunch and it can take quite a while, so I typically don't go for lunch unless I have a lot of time on my hands. Also, while everyone seems to rave about their breakfast, I don't think it's great. I've been there a couple times for breakfast and I've left disappointed both times. Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but it wasn't for me.  Definitely go for happy hour if you're in the area, and sit outside if it's not too hot. The patio is great for people watching, and the food and drink is a great deal.

These guys are just assholes.   I was forced to throw away Cologne, moisturizer, hair product and a couple other things because I didn't have a plastic bag to put them in. The grooming kit I've traveled with for the last four years (and never had an issue with) apparently isn't good enough for Delta. Even US Airways let me travel with my grooming kit, and they are Satan's airline. Delta: if you do anything worse than US Air, you're hitting an all time low.  They're also slow through security (wasting people's money takes time) and generally unfriendly. They are really the whole package.  This shit is why people hate flying. Eff you Delta, never again.

I took my Altima in to get a headlight replaced. Apparently it's a challenge to replace these bulbs, more so than with most cars (according to my regular auto place), so I was told to go to a dealership. Enter Larry Miller Nissan.   When we arrived at the service center there were a couple cars ahead of us. We walked into the office and waited a few minutes before anyone addressed us. After I told them what I needed, they said it might be as long as an hour and a half because they were slammed. The guys in there weren't super friendly, but if they were really that busy I understand...I thought it was weird that it could take 90 minutes to replace a bulb, but whatever, it's better than getting a ticket. I was also quoted a price of about $80 for parts and labor...The bulb price was $30, so that's $50 in labor. I know it's supposed to be a tougher install process than most, but $50 for labor? If I hadn't already been in the office and knew that they had the part and could do it same day, I may have left. I just kept telling myself that it's better than getting a ticket...  After giving them the keys, we walked over to the showroom and (of course) were approached immediately by a member of their sales staff. The guy seemed friendly enough, and asked us what kind of car we had currently. After I told him, he said "oh you know, we've got the Nissan Versa here...It's really popular and it's only $11,900". I don't know why, but this rubbed me the wrong way (probably because I just heard the price and time estimate for the headlight). This guy has no idea what we're shopping for, and no idea what our budget is, so why recommend their cheapest option? I was expecting him to ask what we were look for or what our budget is and go from there...Again, probably me overreacting, but it bugged me.  We left and got some food and came back around an hour and a half later. When we checked in, they said "it's still going to be a few minutes. We're still slammed". I ended up in the waiting room for another 35-40 minutes until the car was done. In the end, it was 2+ hours and $86 to get a headlight replaced.  2 stars because the guy was apologetic at the end about the wait and because the repair included a car wash...I think I'll try somewhere else though if my car ever needs something else dealer specific.

I've been here twice for work sponsored happy hours, which means I've never paid, which naturally raises my rating by a star. Anything free is always better, right?  That said, I like this location. Service is attentive enough, food is OK, and the outdoor area with all the sand (get it? SANDbar...) is really cool. They've got heaters for the winter and misters for the summer, as well as big fans to keep the air circulating. Drink specials are good during happy hour, and there are some food specials as well.   Saw a coworker accidentally walk into the wading pool, and ended up soaked to the thighs...That was pretty funny.   Sandbar is a good place to come get drinks if you're in Chandler, sit outside if it's not too brutal, it's a much more fun experience than being inside.

Came tonight for a beer after work. I've lived in Tempe for a year and a half, about 6 minutes away from Taste of Tops, yet I'd never been here...Shame on me.   So I freely admit, I have really high standards for my beer...If you've read my review of Four Peaks, you'd know that. I don't apologize for it, but I'm definitely a snob when it comes to this stuff.  I was pleasantly surprised that Taste of Tops has a great selection of beer and helpful bartenders that make spot on recommendations for what you're in the mood for. I'd go so far as to say that it's the best selection of beers I've found so far in Arizona. Not the widest selection, but they offer really good options as well as some obscure selections you won't see too many places.   Tonight I had a Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA and a winter brew that was delicious (okay, okay...I had two of those). My wife had a hard cider that she liked a lot, and we also tried a coffee/beer combo that was pretty good. One of the coolest things about Taste of Tops is that they let you bring in outside food since they don't offer a kitchen. We had Thai food delivered from next door, and they were totally cool just watching us eat.   It's a small place, but there's good seating at the bar, and enough tables to make it work. Taste of Tops is a must if you're a fan of good beer. Ambiance and decor is interesting, they have art made from water bottles and milk jugs, which can make for interesting conversation. Ample parking outside, and plenty of food options close by that you can either bring in or get delivered.  I'll definitely be back. A+

I found Lightning Lube on Yelp when I first moved to the area. I know nothing about fixing cars and I was coming off a 1600 mile drive in moving from Portland to Phoenix, so I needed an oil change.  I tried them out because of their reviews and I'm glad I did. They are friendly, fast and do great work. Lightning Lube is the epitome of a no BS business. There is no upselling or guilt tripping like you get at some auto shops. They just ask you what you're looking for and they'll let you know if you need anything else. Last time I was here, they told me I needed a new cabin air filter. I was like "eh, it' $40...". So they brought my current one in and showed it to me. "This is the air you're breathing currently", they said, shaking the dust from my filter. After that I told them to ring it up and install it.  I'm always in and out in 20-25 minutes, and always happy with the results. Prices are great and their check in offer on Yelp makes their oil changes even better. If you live near Scottsdale, this should be your go to place for oil changes and general auto maintenance.

I've been to 5th and Wine a number of times. Once for dinner and a few times for happy hour. For dinner, it wasn't my favorite. I had an entree salad that was OK, and I thought a lot of the dinner options were overpriced for what you get. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, I dunno.  5th and Wine, however, is one of my favorite happy hours in town. Their bruschetta is very, very good. I especially like the apple, fig and brie with honey, and the prime rib with horseradish. The Parmesan fries are ridiculous...I always want to get two orders but don't in fear of the judgement that would meet me from the server, other patrons, the rest of the table, etc. They have a great Caesar salad on that menu as well, and it's $3...Crazy. The the happy hour menu is full of delicious options, the prices are fantastic and they also offer all of their wines by the glass for $5. I can come hungry, leave full and the tab for two people is usually around $25...Pretty sweet deal.   I'm sure I'll go back and give their dinner menu another try, but in the meantime I highly recommend their happy hour.

This Chipotle is quickly becoming a regular lunch spot for me. The lines are long, but the people working there are fast, efficient and friendly. Even if there are 30 people in line ahead of you (and there often are), you're typically ordering within 5-10 minutes. Steve Ells would be so proud of this location.   I love the chicken tacos. Their grilled chicken is bomb, and the tortillas are tasty. Three chicken tacos with cheese, lettuce and hot salsa is my jam. The food is good, and it just feels fresher and better for you than any other fast food option. They also offer Coke Zero, which is good since I'm trying to give up non-diet soda (New Year's resolution...trying to "get healthier" and "drop pounds" so I don't have a "weight problem"...Sorry, just had to channel my inner Chris Farley for a minute).  Anyway...Rather than getting crappy fast food for lunch, or paying way too much for crappy food at a chain restaurant in Tempe, I'll hit up Chipotle a couple times a week and at least feel OK about my lunch choices.

Best burger I've had in Phoenix. I'll start there.  Was here for dinner and drinks a while back, and I'm disappointed in myself that I've yet to return. Atmosphere is great. Kinda dark, cool bar, nice booths. It's a place you can sit and talk and enjoy good food and drinks for a few hours (which we did).  I had a couple of whiskey based drinks (think an old fashioned with a twist), that I liked very much. Was a good way to start the evening. After a little while, we ordered. I got a burger with white cheddar, BBQ sauce, bacon and arugula, cooked medium rare. At a place like this, you can actually order your burger cooked like a steak, since they're so good and the flavor is enhanced even more. The burgers are huge...It takes up most of a dinner place.  The burgers are cooked in a special oven, and I don't know exactly what they do, but it's working. Wonderfully charred on the outside, moist, juicy and flavorful on the inside. The toppings were all wonderful, and although there was a ton of arugula, the peppery flavor complimented nicely. We also ordered fries, which have Parmesan and taragon, and are delicious. Literally every part of the meal was delicious.     We finished the evening off with some Moscow mules and called it a night. Overall it was a great experience, and if someone asks me where the best burger around is, I know where to direct them. Please note, this place isn't cheap. Burgers and sides for 2 will be $35-40, add in drinks and you're looking at $50-60. For some, it might be too expensive for a burger. For me? It's worth every penny (hell, I'd probably happily pay more). I want to return, and soon.

It's a great burger...The stuff isn't cheap, but it's really tasty.   There are a variety of options, tons of toppings and options, a veggie burger (if you're into that sort of thing), and a bunch of different types of fries.  I've been twice, I had the Kobe burger once (not worth the extra $, because the regular burgers are so good on their own), and the Samburger last time I was there. Both burgers were really good, but I thought the fries were a little underwhelming.   The best part of the menu to me is their milkshakes. Awesome milkshakes. Keep in mind though, you'll be taking out a second mortgage to buy a burger, fries and milkshake (no joke those three things will run you $25 + tax/tip). Only other real negative is that there always seems to be a wait. It's not that big inside, and I don't want to sit outside when it's 100+.  There are a couple spots that I think have better burgers, but Zin is a very, very good option in Phoenix.

Really great burgers...I would hope so with a name like Smashburger. This location is really good, so it gets busy at lunch time. Waiting is a bit of a pain, but it's typically not too long. The food takes a few minutes too, which is a positive in my book. The food here feels a lot fresher and better than fast food, though if you've seen their burgers, it's not a place that's super healthy.  They also offer chicken sandwiches (crispy or grilled), and salads, so there are some healthier options, but the winners here are the burgers and fries. Definitely try the smash fries. Tossed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, they are delicious. Burgers are really good and juicy, and the ingredients they use seem fresh.  Cons are the long lines, and it's also not a place where you'll be in and out in 15 minutes. It's also not inexpensive. A burger, fries and a drink will run you $10-11, which seems high for "fast food", though I think it's worth it. What's nice though, is that you sit down with your number and they bring you your food, and they'll bus your table, so it feels like a combo of fast and full service...I suppose this is a perfect example of "fast casual".   It's pretty close to my office, so I'll be back often. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and craving a burger.

Blue 32 is my favorite place in town to watch a game (other than my living room). It's the best sports bar food I've had in the area, the booths are really comfortable and there are a ton of high quality HD TVs. I've been there for Oregon football games, which are always fun (except when we play an Arizona school), as well as Arizona basketball games and the NCAA tournament. I've also been there randomly when I'm craving their boneless wings...  One of the best memories I have in AZ was at Blue 32 watching the Sweet 16 game this year between Arizona and Duke. Seeing the roof blown off by all the U of A fans was pretty special...It reminded me of the fanaticism that I see in Oregon for Duck football. That's what's so great about Blue 32. It's not 100% crazy, but there's always a good energy going, with the occasional freakout moment when Derrick Williams throws down on what seems like the entire Duke starting 5...  As far as food goes, I love their boneless buffalo wings. They also have good onion rings and fries, and their burgers, sandwiches and salads are also pretty good. They have a great happy hour with cheap appetizer options (cheap boneless wings!!!) and good beer specials.  There's ample parking and outdoor seating as well. There isn't a bad seat in the house because they have so many TVs. Regardless of where you're sitting you'll be able to watch what you came to watch. If it's really busy, service gets pretty slow, so keep that in mind if you end up here during a big game. Overall, Blue 32 is a great place to come for good food and drinks while you're watching your favorite team.

Love Jimmy Woos. One of my favorite lunch spots in Old Town. It's sad, but the waitresses know my order when I sit down (that says a lot about me I suppose...). Seriously though, their orange peel chicken is my jam. They have great lunch specials, and it's good for dinner as well. They offer pick up service, but if you're traveling more than 10 minutes, it's not nearly as good as you would hope, especially if you've eaten there before and are expecting awesomeness.   The have a new menu with some Thai and sushi options in addition to their Chinese cuisine. I don't really get why they added sushi to the menu since there are roughly 528 other sushi options in old town, but other than that the new menu is solid.  Decor is pretty cool (great booths), and they have a full bar and extensive drink menu with pretty good HH options. All in all if you like Americanized Chinese food, Jimmy Woos is a must in Old Town.

LOVE Spotted Donkey...Originally came for happy hour and have come back multiple times for dinner. The menu is inventive and unique, they offer great drinks and awesome happy hour specials. You'll also find plenty to enjoy on the lunch and dinner menus.   Definitely try the "Shooters". They're Jalapeno peppers stuffed with cheese and bacon, panko breaded and fried, served with a buttermilk ranch dipping sauce. As amazing as they sound, they taste even better. The rest of the HH options are also good, the taquitos and chips and salsa combo are money and all of the happy hour prices are very good. They also offer a reverse happy hour from 9-12 for those who prefer late night dining.   For lunch or dinner you can't go wrong with the tacos or fish tostadas, and they also have an awesome burger on the menu. The service is always attentive, and the ambiance is very cool as well. On the weekends there are live mariachi bands that will play. My favorite is an all female band with a great lead singer...They're legit.  I didn't know this place existed 4 months ago, but it's become one of my favorite dinner and happy hour spots in Scottsdale. Definitely worth a visit if you haven't been yet or just haven't been in a while.

iPic is swanky. It's like a Vegas nightclub inside. You feel like a VIP, and you're within striking distance of the Kierland Cougars. Young, single men...This is where you should be to find a Sugar Mama. When I first saw a movie here, I thought it was the best possible movie going experience. Tickets were between $19-21, but it was such an awesome place that I thought it was worth it.  Here's the thing. The nice seats that recline and come with personal service are now $27 a piece. For $27, I can go to a Diamonbacks game, a Suns game, a concert, a show at ASU Gammage...There's a lot I can do for $27. Two people going to a movie, getting a drink and a bite to eat at iPic will run $100, easy. You can become a member which lowers the price of their expensive seats to $20, but that's only valid certain nights of the week. On the weekends? Even members are paying $27 a pop.  For me? It's not worth it. There's another place in the area that has larger theatres with better seats, more separation from people around you, more room to stretch your legs (I'm 6'3" and my feet hit the half wall in front of the chair when I'm fully reclined at iPic), personal service, a full bar and good food...Tickets are $12-15, and that's become my go to theatre in the Phoenix area.   iPic has cheaper seats, but they don't move or recline, and you don't get the chance to have food/drinks brought to you. For the real experience, you've got to shell out the cash.   The service is alright. I ordered a soda that wasn't refilled at all and we placed an order for a dessert that never came (luckily we weren't charged for it).   If people are seeing a movie at iPic, I'll tag along. It's still a really nice theatre, and there are some cool perks like free popcorn and a blanket (apparently they're washed regularly), but it's no longer at the top of my list for best places to see a movie.  4 star experience, 0 star price point.

Really, really love this ballpark. It's big, modern and great looking, with awesome seats, a great lawn area and a jumbo screen that rivals many pro ball parks. This could easily be a AA-AAA baseball stadium.  The thing that sets this place apart is the food options. There are a ton of places that you can get a beer, but there are some really unique food options, including a hot dog place that has crazy combinations. I tried a sausage with chorizo, cheese sauce, jalapenos and tortilla strips. It was pretty awesome and very unique.   The seats by home plate and the infield are sweet. Great angle, great views. The best part about this park, however, is the guy who sells chocolate chip cookies. Anyone that's ever been to this park should know him. He walks all around the stadium screaming (literally) at the top of his lungs (literally) CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You can hear him from a mile away (probably literally), and always sells out. He seems to be a crowd favorite for good reason. He's a gem.  Another cool touch is the banks of dispensers with SPF 30 sunscreen all around the park. They're everywhere, and free, which is great for anyone who forgets to pack the banana boat. I can't wait for next March...Only 11 more months.

El Hefe - Macho Taqueria. Man...  At first glance it looks like every stereotype you've ever heard about Scottsdale. At second glance you realize that it is, indeed, every stereotype you've heard about Scottsdale. It's a "Mexican Restaurant", so when I was there I tried a few of their tacos that were on happy hour. I'm giving two stars because the duck taco that I had was pretty good, but once the food got to the table it took me 4 minutes to figure out which tacos were mine because of the way they present the food. More on this later.   El Hefe has a cool in-table tap system, where you pay at the table and can pour your own beer. When I saw this I liked it a lot, though they only offer two beers, and it's not cheap. After the "cool" factor wears off, you realize that you're paying extra to pour your own beer. Not so cool. The upside is the fact that I get beers for myself much faster than the servers at El Hefe did for me.   The booth seats are covered in plastic, in the style of your great grandmother. This is assuming, of course, that your great grandmother commissioned Ed Hardy to design her living room group. The ambiance isn't my style, but I'm sure that a lot of people love it...The biggest issue I had is the way the food is brought to the table. They start you with chips and salsa. It seems hard to screw up chips and salsa, but it happened here. The salsa comes in small jars that are downright weird, and they make dipping your chip absolutely impossible. You need to be a salsa MacGyver to figure out how to get the right amount of salsa on your chip...It's strange. After pushing some salsa around with a chip on a small plate for a while, our food arrived. Apparently, when you order tacos, they come 5-6 at a time, placed on wooden slabs that are roughly the size of a Las Vegas buffet. Our server couldn't remember who's tacos were who's, so we played a game of musical tacos (and wooden slabs) until we all figured out what we'd ordered. When a group of 4-5 orders 10+ tacos, you end up with 2-3 giant wooden slabs on your table and a very confusing family style presentation.   Like I said before, the duck taco I had was pretty good, and I hear good things about the BeerRita. However, unless I'm dragged against my will by a large group of people, I don't see myself returning to El Hefe anytime soon.

I really like this Majerle's location. It was very close to where I used to work so it became a regular lunch spot. Prices are reasonable and the food is good. Their burgers are pretty good, I love their fries and the buffalo chicken sandwich is great.   In addition to being a solid option for lunch, Majerle's is a great place for happy hour. Really good drink specials and all their apps (with a couple exceptions) are just $5. It's a great place to watch a game and has a nice sports atmosphere. Service is good, though if it's packed it can suffer a little. That happens anywhere though so I can't hold it against them.  If you want to watch a game at a sports bar in Old Town and have good food while doing it, this is the place to go.

These guys are great. I've tried for more than a year to find a stable, prompt and reputable cleaning service. I'd failed miserably. Some did mediocre work, others were impossible to get a hold of, some were really overpriced for what you got.  Enter Wave House Cleaning. I called and left a voicemail, and had a return call in under an hour. They had an opening two days later, and their work was stellar. The house looked amazing, and with the "deep" clean option they cleaned all of our baseboards, ceiling fans, the inside of our oven, window sills and tracks as well as really in depth work on all the other areas of the house.   I'll be having them come in twice a month for their regular cleanings, which are $65 per session (minus potential discounts for regular services). The deeper clean runs around $100, but it's not necessary every time, likely just once every couple months.   They're highly recommended from me, for whatever that's worth, I'm just relieved that I've finally found a great service!

I stumbled on The Habit while driving around, looking for a new place to go for lunch. The parking lot was full and the line was long, so I figured it must be good.   It took me a while to navigate the line, but I ordered my burger and fries, and they give you this pager thing like you get at restaurants, which lets you know your food is ready. It's  good system, because it gives you a chance to grab your drink and pick a table. The first couple times I went I had a bacon cheeseburger. I really liked the flavors, the bun is delicious, and the fries are really good. Very crispy which I like.  As you're ordering, you can see them grilling the meat on an open flame, and you can also watch them put together the orders. They clearly strive for quality, and it shows. Their charburgers are really good.   I look at this like a better In-and-Out with more options. The grilled buns and American cheese remind me of In-and-Out, but you can also get bacon, mushrooms, a couple kinds of cheese etc. They also have healthier options, including salads and grilled chicken sandwiches (the grilled chicken is great).  I'm glad I found The Habit, because it's become a regular lunch spot for me.

After I wrote my review last week detailing my lackluster experience, the GM of Coal Burger reached out to me and let me know that he was sorry about my experience, and said that if I came back he'd show me what a great burger can be. I was really impressed that they would proactively reach out and try to make it right, and I was happy to return and give them a second chance.  (In the message, he also let me know that you can order your burger cooked to order, and they're happy to cook to medium...That's good to know and a huge plus in my eyes.)   I returned today for lunch and asked for the manager (at his request), he came out, introduced himself and we chatted briefly. He was a really nice guy, took my order, and paid for my lunch. I was prepared to pay, so that was a really nice surprise. I ordered the same thing I did last time (Bacon Cheeseburger, side of fries and a drink) to make it a good comparison.   They brought me my food, and it was night and day from my last visit. The burger was cooked medium, juicy and flavorful. The coal fired cooking process shines through when the burger is cooked like this, and it was really delicious. The cheese and bacon add a lot to that, and their barbeque sauce is a nice addition to the burger. Fries seemed a bit better than last time, they're very crispy which I like. Needless to say I was impressed with my food.  All the other great stuff from my previous review still stands, I love the organic concept, it's really nice inside, very clean, the service is friendly and that soda machine remains great.   I'll definitely be back. It's expensive, but worth it, and the fact that they were so accommodating and willing to make it right for me raises them another couple notches in my book. I highly recommend going, ordering your burger medium or medium well (depending on how you like it) and I think you'll be impressed.

Genesis is the absolute best. I've gone to her for more than a year now, every 3-4 weeks, and the cut is consistent and awesome. Her attention to detail separates her from any other stylist I've ever gone to.  If you're a guy and you care about your hair, you can't do better than Genesis for a cut. Not cheap at $35 + tip, but it's worth every penny.

Randomly, our A/C unit started leaking a ton of water and condensation into our unit, soaking through the filter and causing some odd noises. Not what you want to see and hear on July 1st in Arizona. I called a lot of different places and everyone was telling me that they were booked until Tuesday of next week - obviously that wasn't going to work for me.   I finally called the guys at PriceMyAC, and not only did they pick right up, but Tom told me that they could be out in 60-90 minutes, which was music to my ears. Sure enough, after about an hour, they showed up, and 30 minutes after that they'd finished up and everything was running smoothly. They quickly found and diagnosed the problem, went above and beyond in fixing it, and their prices were very reasonable. The guys were friendly and professional, and I'd highly recommend them. Five stars.

Martin at Trump's Moblie Mechanics was amazing to deal with. To start, they're a mobile service, so they showed up at my house at 7am and I was able to meet with him before I went to work. Additionally, their level of service is fantastic. They kept me posted along the way, letting me know exactly what they'd be doing, and how much it would cost.   I appreciated the approach and the honesty that Martin showed during the entire process. Getting honest feedback from an auto repair business is a rare thing, but I was totally comfortable with everything he was telling me. Hearing "honestly, if it was my car, I wouldn't worry about this right now", is a pretty refreshing take on auto service.   In the end, necessary repairs were expertly made to my car, at a fraction (literally) of the price I was quoted by the dealer. As a guy who knows nothing about cars and needs an honest mechanic, Martin has earned my business, and my highest recommendation to anyone looking for auto repair in the valley.
