Mama Java's feels like it belongs in a small college town. The three times I've been here the clientele has been younger, relaxed, and friendly. As are the employees.  The only reason I'm not giving Mama Java's five stars is because the only thing I've tried is their house coffee, which is very good.   This is one of the coffee houses in central Phoenix where I can be pretty confident of finding an empty seat next to an electrical outlet to take advantage of their free wireless. Although they do have live music that at times fills the front of the house, there is a separate area in the back with bar-style seating and seating for about a dozen. There's a pretty good chance I can get some work done at Mama Java's anytime.

I've taken both of my vehicles to Alexander's (now A&J) for at least 5 years. And I've always had excellent service and thought the price was fair.   What can you say about a car repair shop? They charge you a fair price, fix the issue, and don't screw anything else up. Thumbs up.  But there is one thing about these guys that stands out to me.  I was referred to A&J's by a good friend who, by her own admission, is a merciless consumer. She's great at knowing where she can get the most for her money and when she finds those places she's very loyal. Since I've been taking vehicles to Alex I've also referred a handful of people there. And they've all thanked me for the referral and (at least those that still live in Phoenix), still take their cars to A&J's for service.

The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.    *I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf.

Mi Patio is a clean and casual family-owned restaurant in central Phoenix. Mi Patio is unique to any other Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area as the cuisine is Mexican with a Greek influence to some of their dishes.   Mi Patio is also distinguished from other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area because it FEELS like it's family owned. More often than not one of either of owners will personally inquire about your dining experience.  I've never had anything but great food at Mi Patio and although most Mexican restaurants are generous with their portions Mi Patio is extremely generous. You won't leave Mi Patio hungry.  It's hard for me to pick the best item on the menu but I'm fond of the Mexican pizza and the Greek-Mex salads.  And although this is a very clean family atmosphere it also has a great bar. The bar is short and in the front of the restaurant but it feels like the neighborhood bar where you know the names of everyone sitting there before you finish your first drink. Like many of their customers you may have first heard about the business from word-of-mouth. They serve great margaritas for $2.00. :-)  Mi Patio is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I stop in whenever I can. And a lot of times when I don't have the time to eat there I get food to go (their to-go menu is really inexpensive - something like $4.95 for a two taco plate with rice and beans.)  Check it out!

Crazy Jim's is a small greek joint with an eclectic menu. They serve all of the following: sub sandwiches, pitas, burgers, pizza, spaghetti dishes, gyros, baklava, calamari, and dozens of salad combinations.  I've only had their gyros and pizza - both of which I would recommend.  Also - the staff are always friendly and quick in my experience.

This upscale Biltmore bar invested six figures on televisions in the bar. The drinks and food are pricey - but you're in the middle of the Biltmore. Whaddaya expect.   The waitstaff is attractive...no...fuckin hot is a better description.  The place is pretty crowded for happy hour and during lunch but it's a great place to catch a game.   They have three private rooms that are first come first served. These rooms are set up just like your house - you know with your leather couches and huge flatscreen TVs and the hot chic giving you beers.

It seems a little strange to review a pawn shop on Yelp but here you go.  Vegas Pawn is on the Tempe/Scottsdale border right next door to Skin Cabaret. It's aptly named. Between the limos outside Skin and Vegas Pawn's sign it does look a little like Vegas.  I went to Vegas Pawn for on other reason besides the fact that I had never visited a pawn shop before. And it was an interesting experience.  How do you judge one pawn shop from another? Inventory? Customer service? Good deals?  My first impression was security. These guys are serious! You have to be allowed to enter. The front door opens to a steel cage which the desk clerk has to buzz open before you enter the rest of the store.  And this is understandable after seeing their inventory. This is a high-end pawn shop with a large selection of jewelry, watches (Rolex, Cartier), loose diamonds, gold, and more. They also buy and sell boats, ATVs, motorcycles...etc.  I had no idea pawn shops kept that type of inventory.   Everyone I met there was helpful and friendly. I don't necessarily see myself pawning anything in the near future but I'd go back to Vegas Pawn if I needed.

I'm too late! I just found out that the soul food restaurant inside of Phil's (yeah I know..sounds unlikely) has closed!  For about six months Bumblebee Soul Food Company was serving fried chicken, catfish, smothered pork chops etc.....and it was great.  Christian, the (ex) owner of Bumble Bee is related to Mrs. White of Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe. Between Christian's Bumble Bee, Larry White's Lolos, and the Golden Rule Cafe,  this is the royal family of Phoenix soul food. If one of them had a pet that opened a soul food restaurant in Phoenix I would have high expectations upon entering.   Back to Phil's. Phil's is the closest bar to my house and I wind up there for happy hour a few times a month. I agree with the other reviewers that it is a great little dive bar with friendly regulars. The only drawback to Phil's is the lack of dive bar beers like PBR and Schlitz.

My experience at Eddie's Pizza Lounge was so bad it was laughable.  I went to order lunch to go on a Wednesday afternoon. The only people there were myself, the kid taking orders, and a cook. I checked out the menu above the cash register, decided on a Gyro for $6.99.  The transcript:  Me: Hey how're you doing. Can I have a gyro to go and a can of Coke?  Employee: Sure  (I hand him a ten and he gives me back 35 cents).  Me: How much is the coke?!  Employee: 75 cents.  Me (not knowing what the sales tax is): So you owe me at least $1, right? (I'm thinking more like $1.50 but whatever).  Employee: ....  Me: Can you give it to me?  Employee: (Gives me $1 bill).  (Now I notice their specials on a sign on the north wall of the place. Gyro with Fries for $4.99)  Me: Why don't you just give me the special for $4.99?  Employee: It comes with fries.  Me: I don't want the fries..you can charge me $4.99 and keep the fries.  Employee:  But it comes with fries.  Me: Ok fine. Give me the fries.  (I pay, He f*cks up the change again by 10 cents but I leave it alone. 5 minutes pass. Then he returns from the back.)  Employee: We're out of fries.  :)  Actually the experience made my day. It's nice to walk into a real-life comedy skit sometimes.  So for the review: The gyro was good. And for $4.99 (um..with fries) a good deal too. The place also has a hookah lounge that looked like it hadn't been used for weeks but I'm guessing they have a crowd after Tempe bars close - for both food and tobacco. They're open til 5 am.

The Capitol Sports Lounge opened in late 2009 on the southwest corner of 18th Avenue and Van Buren.   This seemingly unlikely location actually brings in an interesting mix of professionals from downtown and State buildings, sports fans, and locals to the neighborhood.   I had not been to bar that Capitol has replaced but after speaking with a few regulars it's clear that the new owner have sunk a lot of time and money into the bar. With high definition TVs on every wall (and the interior is huge) and a great sound system, it's a fantastic place to watch games.   The bartenders and managers were very friendly. Their prices on bottled beer were fair and they had free hot dogs and appetizers when I was there.   I will be returning to the Capitol. Plus I've heard a rumor that they've got a Steak Night to compete with the Hidden House on Wednesday nights.
