This resort is truly the cream of the crop in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  The staff is all engaged in helping guests and making sure their experience is memorable.  My 2 year old loved the kiddie pool and splash pad.  Not to mention we probably went around the lazy river 10 times.  But it was all well worth it.  I won't stay anywhere else next time I'm in Arizona and can't recommend this place enough.

We walked in the door and was greeted by no one.  After about a 4-5 minute wait, someone from the kitchen finally appeared and sat us in a booth.    My wife ordered the seafood pho and I got the meatball pho both complimented by a couple glasses of water.  Now, I can't really say whether or not the pho was good or bad as this was our first time eating it.  It was pretty flavorful but the "meatballs" were far from what I'm used to.  Also, my wife was upset they used imitation crab as opposed to real crab, but still enjoyed it.  Service at this place is lacking.  Water glasses went empty and the servers kept walking by us and not refilling.  I had to track someone down who wasnt our server to ask for a refill.  We won't be back.

I've never dealt with more snobs in my life that I have at this restaurant. My wife and I went here for a couple drinks and appetizers before attending a movie in the same complex.  Our first server, didn't catch his name but he was old enough to be my grandfather, essentially scoffed at us once we told him we didn't want to have dinner but only a couple appetizers and drinks.  After putting in our drink order of some peach iced tea special they had (nothing on the drink menu sounded tasty), he disappeared and sent a younger waiter to help us.  Neither offered an explanation of why the change, but I assume its because Grandpa expected to receive a crappy tip since we weren't there for dinner.  We ordered the Margherita flatbread and ravioli appetizer.  The flatbread was a good concept, but when I think "flatbread." I think flat bread.  This tasted more like a New York style thin crust pizza.  The raviolis were good but tasted like they were frozen and thrown into an oven for a few minutes.  One of my biggest pet peeves while dining out is having an empty glass.  Between the iced tea and a water that I ordered afterwards, both went empty before a refill was offered.  Additionally, after we finished everything, we sat there, with all plates and glasses stacked at the end of the table signifying that we were done, for about 10 minutes before our server finally appeared for the first time since taking our order (no one came to check to see if everything was okay after food was brought out.)  In conclusion, I rated this restaurant a "1" due to a commercialized food taste as well as receiving a level of service that was amazingly horrible.  This place is the very reason people call the area "Snobbsdale" and never in a million years would I recommend this place to my worst enemy.

I had these guys install a set of 8000K HIDs for my headlights and foglights.  Upon completion, I found that when turning on the headlights normally, one bulb was out.  However, I was able to activate it by flipping my brights on and then turning them off every time I needed my lights.  I didn't know it at the time but this was a HUGE red flag.  Fast forward to less than a year later... my wife and I move out of state and while turning on my car at night to drive home from work, I find my foglights and the one headlight are not working.  I let it go for a while as its the peak season for the industry I'm in and don't have time to bring it somewhere for fixing.  Which would turn out to be my next mistake.  Finally, the inevitable happens... the last headlight goes out.  So... here I am, less than a year after I purchased these lights and both headlights and foglights are out.  I bring it to a local shop to have the HIDs taken out and go back to stock bulbs. They have had the car for a week now because the people who installed it literally cut the wiring for who knows what reason causing me to spend an extra $200 to re-wire my headlight assembly (I didn't have the fix the foglights which I can imagine will be another $100-$200).    I gave these guys a 1-star only because I couldn't give a "0."  I wouldn't wish the poor service these guys do on my worst enemy.

WOW!  What an amazing experience at this restaurant!!!  My wife and I went to a movie and stopped in the bar for a quick couple drinks.  We initailly stood at the end of the bar for quite a while and were never noticed as new customers but everyone was busy so I don't hold that against anyone.   But once we made our way around to a more "popular" part of the bar, the bartender, Danny, was all over us.  The one thing I liked about this guy is that no matter how busy he was, he was down-to-earth, made us feel that he was paying attention and truely wanted to take care of us.  I ordered what he referred to as an Icepick (I think) which is essentially an Arnold Palmer with vodka and my wife ordered a water.  There was a female co-worker of his who ensured things were good and even checked on my wife's tiramisu when she saw it was taking a while to come out.  Everything about this place was appealing - the ambience, the decor, the menu, the patios and firepits and most importantly, the service.  In fact, I mentioned to my wife that when I open my restaurant, I want it to look and feel the way Tanzy does.  I just finished writing a negative review about Brio and my recommendation is that Tanzy hold a "how to treat your customers" class.  If that happened, every restaurant in that complex would be top notch.  Thank you to the entire staff we dealt with for caring!!!  We will be back!!!

Kelli hooked up my wife with a couple new tragus piercings.  He was very detail orientated and spent all the time he needed to to ensure the piercings were even.  Very clean and modern facility.  Looks like I found the place to go when its time for my first ink!
