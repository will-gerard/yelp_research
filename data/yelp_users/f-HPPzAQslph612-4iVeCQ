The BFD isn't Payton Curry. its not the food, either, its the floorshow. Payton and his wife manage to make this tiny space feel cavernous and fabulous. Their banter is hysterical, and Payton somehow manages to hear everything said on the floor from his outpost cooking. The words fly fast, but you'll laugh hysterically.    And the food? Inventive, fresh, reasonable and fast.

lord knows i don't find myself in gilbert often, but if you do, it'd be criminal not to stop here. what a lovely, lovely place. i stopped with a slew of cohorts and was charmed by the decor, the menu and the service, which were - funky but clean, short but comprehensive and attentive & personable without being overbearing.   though my friends were just going for coffee, i went for dinner and chose the smoked salmon place and the glazed carrots. both were delicious, presented well, etc.   the coffee is the real star- we were amused by the "bowl" options and had been warned ahead of time. Ahead of time we'd been advised to "go cordadito" on the coffee.  excellent move. i wasn't overwhelmed with it, but my friends were and the presentation alone is worthwhile.   this is a lovely place to pop into, at reasonable prices and staff that really goes out of their way.

I eat a lot of sushi, and I'm a snobby bitch about it, so that might translate to the fact that I'm a decent critic of sushi, or just that I'm a snobby bitch. Either way, I attest that Hiro stands out above the sushi fray in Scottsdale where there's a sushi joint for every man, woman & child. If you don't believe me, well... more sushi for me.   Hiro is not a place to be seen. Its about the chow, and to say its old school is like saying Sarah Palin might have had an Alex P Keaton poster on her wall in high school.   The fish is spectacular, the plating is gorgeous, but perhaps most notable is the expertise. I sat in front of Take, one of the four chefs on staff and was mezmerized watching him cut fish. I mean.... I've been to some acclaimed sushi restaurants.. but there is just something when you watch someone who lives this stuff, rather than just someone who's come to it by trade.   On my last visit, there were a number of Japanese businessmen who came in, with their own sake, and sat in front of Hiro himself. This says a lot, and if you experience the same, follow our advice: say to the chef: "we'll have whatever they have".

Your opinion of the Clarendon will depend greatly on what kind of experience you're looking for in a vacation. Scottsdale puts on a great charade of Arizona, fast becoming a Disneyland with boob jobs. Its clean, and new and largely soulless. The visitors that stay there end up with an anesthetized view of the Valley.   When I think of uniquely "Arizona" experiences, the Clarendon ranks right up there. Here is a building that has seen it all, and rather than strip it of its history, new ownership has polished and buffed it to a beautiful shine.   From the moment your feet hit the entry, with its embedded glass in the driveway, you understand the vibe.  The lobby is largely positioned to encourage lounging- ample room, tables, power plugs and free wifi.   You know how normally the last place you'd eat it as your hotel? The food is crap, expensive, and served by people who really would rather be shaving their toes? Gallo Blanco defies that in every way. The food is no nonsense authentic sonoran, served at prices that can't be believed, by staff who seem genuinely happy to be around.   The margaritas are worth noting separately- as a local I've been nursed on tequila, but it never tasted like this. Everything about it is fresh-everything came from something in the ground, not a bottle. Sugar cane, fresh lime- it was singularly fabulous. Sangria ranks high as well for being white, not too sweet, and well balanced. A perfect poolside treat.   Which brings us to the reason you're staying at the Clarendon: the pool. Hollywood sets wish they were this cool. Its big, its blue, with ample, bright poolside beds and couches.  A wall of waterfalls, an epic hot tub. As I hit my room finally at midnight, I was tickled by the inlaid stones of the pool, glittering in the moonlight.   My friends and I were impressed by the rooms.  It provided something most rooms don't in hotels: space. Four of us sat comfortably around, people watching through the window, enjoying our cocktails and the inroom fridge. The flatscreen, appreciated, never even was turned on. I did however appreciate the advanced alarm radio which slowly lulled me from sleep Sunday morning.  Both men in our party noted somewhat humorously about the relative size of the sink. My morning shower provided immediate hot water and who can't appreciate a hotel that is generous with the high end shampoo and soap.   My evening out was a hop on the light rail, I was in the center of everything. Ample COVERED parking made the summer heat bearable. My checkin and out was smooth.   But my overwhelming reason you should stay at the Clarendon? Trust a local. The place is packed all the time with locals, working and hanging out in the lobby, enjoying the pool or the rooftop.   End of story? If a truly uniquely Arizona experience, complete with local flavor and personality is what you're looking for, you can do no better than the Clarendon.

Yasu is usually one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of being in. It consistently wows, with inventive dishes and a definitive style that always have me wishing I was walking back in when I'm finally heading out. Yasu himself is charming and helpful and they have one wonderful, awesome waiter- an American with a suspiciously Japanese name who goes out of his way to help.   We did not get him.   On a Sunday at 7pm myself and 5 friends met for our reservation. We are all repeat customers. HEAVY repeat customers.   We ordered drinks and about the time they finally showed up, a cool 25 minutes later, we were informed they were all out of tuna.   Wrr? We all sighed and said... ok and ticked off an awful lot of other sushi options which we then turned in.  A few minutes later, our waitress (emphasis on the 'wait') returned and said that the wait was 35 minutes for sushi and would we care to order from the kitchen? We reluctantly said ok and placed a few orders.   So imagine our surprise when moments later our sushi began to arrive. Well. Sort of. Our waitress appeared with 3 uni shots instead of 6. All 6 of us eyed them, wondering who we'd have to take out to get one, and I calmly ask the waitress to retrieve our other uni shots "expedited, perhaps"?  Instead our waitress walked around the restaurant puzzedly WITH the uni shots like a nomad until she returned 5 minutes later to say there was no more uni.  A nice bunch, we all surrendered our shots until the three smartest amongst us grabbed them and then crowed about their taste.  The waitress offered us 3 oyster shots instead. They sucked.   So it was odd when oysters showed up WITH uni on them (though we should say we did order them with uni) a bit later. 5 of them. For the six of us. It is now an hour into our meal. We have already begun texting sweet republic, begging them to stay open. Or atleast bring us ice cream, because were hungry, damnit.   A process is established. Every 30 minutes or so a single dish of sushi or something arrives. We each eat one piece, compliment it, and then spend 30 minutes digesting. Halfway through a waiter or waitress will appear to let us know something we ordered is out. But they have "everything else".  We have stopped being quiet and are now openly hysterical. And hungry.  At some point management approaches and we instruct him to turn around and go away until he has good news.   They are out of our sake, but are happy to suggest another that is 3x the price. One of the diners suggests they comp it. He laughs. After three hours, all still a wee bit hungry, but 80$ poorer and without a glimmer of hope for sweet republic, we depart.   We've been comped nothing. Not an "I'm sorry". Not a "hey, have some edamame on us". Not a "we've knocked 10% off the bill".  We are a bit hysterical over the comical situation, but also not a little pissed. A 400$ bill for a bunch of regulars with a reservation?    Sigh.

Thumbs WAY up on the Bar Bites menu- don't be afraid to go alone! I'm a Nocaholic. When I'm in town, I go. It isn't optional. But imagine my disappointment  when my dinner date had to rush out of town on emergency. I'm down with the single, but eating my myself in a restaurant? meh. Shouldn't have been worried. Of course, this is NOCA. So noticing my twitter mention of the issue, Chef Chris tweets at me to come on in anyways, and sit at the bar.   I realize this is the perfect idea, and go anyways.   As always, I am greeted by name- a glass of proseco is placed in my hand,and the service stays consistently awesome all night.   The amuse bouche is avocado foam and radish, which is spicy but light like air. perfect start.  The food is... ridiculous. I option for the chicken egg which is as everyone else says, insane. The egg is perfectly cooked, the bacon is what all other bacon aspires to be, and the brioche is appropriately indulgent.   A demitasse of soup arrives and like always, I'm pretty sure "cloud" was one of the ingredients.   For dinner, I actually chose the hamachi two ways off the app menu. A few thick slices of yellowtail, with slightly crunchy panko and then an encrusted hamachi collar. Homemade ponzu. It's divine and perfect yin and yang.   I've now struck up conversation with the bar neighbors in between watching the action behind the bar. I order the gelato, one of my favorites, and slide half of it over their way to taste.   Ridiculously affordable for the quality of food, I walked out thrilled with the experience. Slightly different then my loud, long dinners there with girlfriends, but quietly lovely nonetheless.

Tuck Shop is one of those places I keep hearing about but never drive past- no wonder-Bin Laden could be wintering there. Its tucked away (haha) around Thomas, but is definitely part of this new movement of neighborhood joints that I love.  Small, beautifully designed, with plenty of parking- we chilled on a couch for a bit and then found a table. The menu is limited, but that's ok. I was with someone who keep kosher, which eliminated all but a few options (at the end of the meal, we mentioned this and were told that accommodations could have been made to any dish on the menu, shame on us for not asking earlier). Either way, dinner was awesome.  We started with Riesling, beets and crostini off the app menu. A whole head of garlic comes with the crostini...it was great. The roasted beets though were the true star...in a creamy mustard sauce, they were awesome.  Dinner was a skirt steak, mashed potatoes and a blood orange salad. The salad was truly wonderful, with a great light dressing. The steak was good, but I have to say, what the Tuck Shop does with veggies really stands out. If I'd ordered without restriction, I'm sure I wouldn't have ordered them, and I'd have missed out. On a return visit, I might go just with veggies.  The service was really lovely- we had an entertaining and fun waiter who was around just enough. Food appeared quickly, was cleared invisibly, and we never had to look for him. He was a delight.   If I lived near Tuck Shop, I'd be there all the time.

blanket statement- i've done a lot of things for really good food-waiting in line, traveling, bribing maitre'ds... but I'm not waiting 4 hours for just pretty good pizza.   I've been watching the parlor go up for a while, intrigued by the construction, but hadn't gotten there to eat yet. SO happy we did- cancel your plans for bianco. this is better.   First, the service was so attentive, which was wonderful. We loved the space, which was mostly reclaimed from the original building, as we were told. Its warm, and cozy, and perfect.   We did the smart thing, asking our waitress what to order, and based on her suggestions, split the beet salad and funghi pizza.   Best. beet. salad. ever.  Better then even delux, which was previously my fav. Same for the pizza. You know how artisinial pizza so often falls flat on the crust? I don't want cracker like crust, and I don't want limp dough.   The parlor's pizza dough is perfect. Thin, but doughy and bubbly, baked to a golden perfection. Our pizza featured these fabulous wild mushrooms- it was covered in them, they had great bite and taste. Goat cheese and truffle oil made the flavor mellow and lovely.   The rest was such a success, we couldn't resist dessert- tiramisu. It was scrumptious.   Can't recommend the place enough. I'll be back.

There are restaurants that are usually great, but occasionally slip, and then there are those rock solid choices you feel free sending friends, business associates, pretty much anyone who needs to trust you to. You know it'll be consistently great, and you know it will wow.   Petite Maison easily has the food of a 5star restaurant, but with the dark cozy cool of a bistro instead of a classic salon. There's a nice balance of bar service vs tables, so you're likely to be able to get in. I recently visited on a Saturday night, and the kitchen went out of their way to squeeze us in at 8pm. Nuts. But its about relationships to them... there's just zero pretentiousness.   The service really stood out as well. Some of the waitstaff has been there since the beginning- they're affable, easy to talk to, and don't vacillate... if you ask for an opinion, they'll actually give you one. You have a larger kitchen at home they PM does, but they're always happy to invite you into theirs so you can see their efficiency. Any restaurant that's that proud of their kitchen is cool with me.   The food is just awesome. Its classic bistro- so there's always steak frites or mussels or some pate.... and they're all AWESOME. The specials stand out as well- on this last visit it was a whole striped bass for two.   The pricing is completely reasonable.. and this is definitely one of those restaurants you want to introduce yourself to the proprietors: Wendy and James.

I could rave on and on about fnb, but that'd just be repetitive given what everyone else here has said. So instead, I'd rather just give you my   TOP 5 TIPS for a LEGENDARY FNB EXPERIENCE  1. Call ahead. Atleast a week, because the days of popping in are long gone. My impression is that if you're willing to take the old people slots (REALLY early, like 5pm) or the raver slots (the latest seating), you're good to go. But that sweet spot 7pm seating? You can't call early enough.   2. Relinquish control of your drink choices. FnB has one of the most talented mixologists in town- his cocktails are made of unicorn dust and leprachan DNA.  Relay your tastes and something magical will appear before you, whether its a cocktail or wine perfectly suited to you.   3. Don't overthink the menu. Its divided into four "parts" which loosely translate to "starters, more starters, possible side dishes but could also be starters, and entrees". Don't try to outsmart the menu, like some guests of mine have, just pick a few starters, an entree and a few sides for the table. There is literally nothing on menu that could be bad, so share everything.   4. FnB vegetables contain opiates.  This is not scientific, but purely observational, because FnB has over the past year made me love fava beans, spaghetti squash, and rutabagas, none of which I have ever been gaga over. They just do something great to veggies, and at some point i'll learn to order nothing else while there. Dear Pavle & Charleen, I hate brussel sprouts. If anyone could change that opinion, it'd be you.   5. If there are leeks on the menu, order them. Do not pass go, do not collect 200$, just go directly to leeks. This seasonal dish is legendary- an odd mix of mozzarella, braised leeks, breadcrumbs and an egg. Its heaven.   The unwritten rule is this: introduce yourself. To Pavle, to Charleen, to Colleen, to Emily, to everyone on staff. They are the friendliest, warmest, most wonderful people, and good friends to have.

As a treat for a friend and I having a hard time, I booked appointments for couture pedicures together, which was the highest service you could get.. a spa pedicure basically. The place itself is cute and clean- they had us in a small room together which was great.   First though... these are just benches with pillows, not pedicure chairs. That was not the BFD. The BFD was that although we'd made appointments, showed up at time and paid for the highest service, the guy doing my pedicure raced through the crappiest pedicure ever. My friend got there 10 minutes before me, I somehow was finished 10 minutes earlier than she was.  Her pedicurist, a woman, was just lovely and sweet and the guy I had couldn't have put in less effort if he tried. There was no massage, he literally just put lotion on me and called it a day. He didn't do any scrubbing of callous.... There's a part of the massage where they wrap your feet in hot towels, which sounds lovely, but these actually hurt, and I've got a pretty decent pain threshold. I mentioned it to him immediately (as in, Holy Christ, that's too hot!). The other pedicurist actually said, "I wait a minute so they cool off".  Guy didn't wrap toes to separate nails, so they were all screwed up by the time I left. Most things were notable only because we were getting side by side pedicures, so it stood to reason they'd be the same. They were not, which made it laughable.   By the end of the pedicure we were openly commenting in a polite way, "hey, don't let me rush you" (which he took literally.... he was busy sweeping the floor while my friend's pedicure was being finished.)  To be fair, I didn't bother tipping him I was so annoyed. And to top it all off... you have to pay $1 surcharge to use a credit card. Don't get me wrong, its a buck. but its insulting.   Wouldn't go near them again and writing this out actually annoyed me again so much i'm calling them tomorrow to say something.

Sunday highlights:   Lobster & pancetta ravioli, with morels and pea shoots from Different Pointe of View. A highlight....  Avocado ceviche from McClendon Farms.   Anything Payton Curry touched- both pates, the sausage, the soup.... it was ridiculous.   Kai put out an amazing spread: the brioche with an egg was wonderful, the ceviche was wonderful, and pork was delicious.   There was a vodka lemonade that was pretty stellar, too.  42 something.   Province had some smoked salmon I really enjoyed as well.   There was a lot of fluff, and word to the wise, avoid vegan marshmallows, regardless of what they're dipped in....   Mostly though, it was so nice to just be out and about in a beautiful venue, full of people who love food, to run into all your friends...  it was a highlight.

I literally couldn't say enough good things about Tien Wong. It succeeds in almost every way except possibly locale. But it also represents a successful culmination of all of Johnny's previous efforts.  The food is a score- its almost impossible to make this meal unhealthy, and yet, it is packed with flavor. You could tailor this meal to fit almost any palate, from the adventurous to the timid tongue. My experiences over 2 visits remind me much of the experience will depend on who you attend with. I found the range of ingredients to add to be phenomenal, including housemade tofu, a range of asian greens, and a huge variety of meats. I'm a tough critic of seafood in the desert, but the mussels, on both visits, were top notch. The fish balls were equally good.  Definites on any trip should include enoki mushrooms, quail eggs, almost any of the beef (though we loved the black pork, too) and the tofu. having tried the Yin Yang, we were disappointed in the blandness of the yin vs the ridiculousness of the yang hotness... much of the meal was spent trying to blend the two to the right proportions. I preferred the lemongrass, and would love to try the curry or miso. Frankly, I'd love them to trust us enough to use the split pot on any two broths we like (not an option- they're scared guests would mix two broths that wouldn't work together, so they control the experience this way).  Be forewarned, any of the spicy soups just get spicier as time goes on....  Really hope that Johnny focuses on these small, authentic spots, rather than expansion, crazy upscale spots, etc.

Spent the afternoon sampling pretty much everything that Earl's has to offer... the thing about BBQ is that when its good, its just awesome, but its so prone to #fail and bad BBQ is inedible. I'm pleased to say there was nothing inedible on Earl's menu and some items were pleasant standout surprises.  - above all, the ribs were just as perfect as ribs can be. Did the half and half, and the beef ribs had a perfect rub finish to them, weren't overdone but had that carmelized crispiness that is just awesome. The pork ribs didn't suffer from overcooking, which I find so often. They had a meltiness to them from preserving some of the fat that was delicious.  Collard greens are just tough, but these were delicious. Not overcooked, still had a bit of bite, and weren't masked in pork products. bright green and fresh.. I loved them.  I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the tasty bits... the pig tails were absolutely delicious. I'd compare them to roasted turkey necks. I question if they need to be fried.  The fried pickles and okra were exactly what you want from them: a bit of crunchy, a bit of salty, a bit of sweet and a lot of dressing.  I tried a few other items including bone marrow, which I enjoyed mostly for its smart addition of okra though I wish it was a bit less cooked, and pork belly, which lets face it, can never be bad. This version, with onion rings and some other accoutrements didn't disappoint. Though nothing fell flat, I felt some items didn't stand up to the truly great menu pieces: macaroni and cheese came in two forms: in a crock and as a deep fried ball. Oddly, the ball had more texture and was thus more interesting, but neither were spectacular next to the ribs.  Worth noting as well were the cocktails. inventive, fresh, and served in mason jars, they were the perfect accompaniment. The barkeep came out to make a suggestion to match my mood and followed up to find out if I liked it.  Overall, the vibe of the place and the food lends itself to a perfect dinner out with the family, or pre club activity. Plenty of food to share at a table, and the drinks to match. This might be the perfect Southern antidote to Arizona summers.

I use couriers occasionally and in Phx, it certainly seems like they are hit and miss, and a bit fly by night. They change ownership often, they seem obnoxious and don't take your important things seriously.   But Mercury is really awesome. They are totally reasonably priced, with no odd "add on" fees. They always answer the phone, they call upon pickup and delivery, and can handle sensitive items.   They're the only ones I'll call.
