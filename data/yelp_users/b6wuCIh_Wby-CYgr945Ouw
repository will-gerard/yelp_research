Loved coming here for their breakfast burritos - perfect ratio of eggs to other ingredients. Stopped by for lunch and there's an eviction notice on their door. Come back!!!

Friendly reception at hostess stand and fast seating despite the Sunday brunch crowd. Manager offered us coffee on the house because we were at the table for 10 minutes without having been greeted by our server. Another manager came by after a while and asked if she could take our order or if we just wanted to wait on our server (why would that even be a consideration?).   My food was okay - comparable to IHOP. My friend asked for well done hash browns - they were turned inside out, so the part that might have been crispy at one point was being steamed, making them mushy and there was barely any meat in her omelette. Had to flag down a server for coffee after being there half an hour. And then they charged us for the coffee anyways.   Overall, I'm just really disappointed I picked this place. I'm fine with an okay breakfast food at a chain restaurant. It's kind of expected, but the customer service needs a lot of work. A manager should have taken the table over or sent a server over immediately. And realistically during peak hours, somebody should be walking the room every 10 minutes for basic refills (water, coffee, etc). I've worked breakfast before, I know it can be crazy but these are not fast turning tables and it is not a very large restaurant. A little bummed out because it's so close to home.   Trying to decide if it was just a bad day or if I should try it again. Don't think my friend will come with me.
