Like everyone else, I loved this place. There's qualifiers as to why we liked it so much,so hold your horses and read on.   We shared the chicken honey mustard biscuit. I thought it was good but would try something else next time. My husband ordered beignets. They were good and the closest thing to NOLA I've had outside of the real thing. I probably would've liked them more if the honey was served on the side instead of under the beignet.   Before you think I'm crazy, trust me on this-the Brussels sprouts were awesome! They're not your mamas Brussels sprouts! My husband, not a big fan typically, thought they were great too. Every meal since then when we discuss what veggie to have with our home meals I ask for Brussel sprouts. Not any but THEIRS. I could probably go vegetarian on these things. Flat out YUMMY!  5 stars for just the brussel sprouts? While they deserved it, the 5 stars comes because it's a seriously cool business. Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly.   Basically it's a bunch of really cute guys, most in bands, who not only have great personalities but they are awesome cooks. They are very aware of local (when possible), quality, natural/organic (when possible) food and are creative with their dishes. I'll be back and I'm bringing some GFs next time. ;-)

The flashlight tour is awesome! My 16 year old niece wished it lasted longer. She loved being able to touch the snakes, see the owl and learn about the stars. My husband and I decided we will come back for date nights here.   The gardens themselves are also great. We bought an annual membership and have used it many times. Every visitor we have had to AZ comes with us and loves it too.

Very relaxing and peaceful zoo. I could easily see myself hang out, watch the animals and read a book on s nice day, if it were closer to home. Worth the trip!

If you enjoy a good ol' burger dive, this is the spot! Service is friendly. Ambiance is very casual with sports decor.   They have both regular burgers, sliders and dogs. The patties are preformed but they cook them so that they're soft vs a hockey puck. The sliders are kinda like a castle burger. The full burgers have a good seared flavor. Buns are soft and squishy. Ingredients were fresh. Fries were basic but good.   Burgers themselves were 3/5. Add in the the old school ambiance and friendly service and its bumped up to 4/5

I would give it higher stats but they weren't clear on where to park so we missed the first bus. Then the front desk person said to show the yelp coupon to the driver to get our discount. Then the driver said to show it when we returned for our car. Needless to say the 4 hours was long gone by then and we didn't get the coupon. Argh!  Other than that, it is a good alternative to airport parking.

We have been all over town looking at nurseries. This place has the best selection plus very knowledgable low pressure sales. Their prices are better than the "discounted" price my landscaper gets wholesale and Whitfils plants are bigger! Super excited to meet with their designer Joy this week to plan out the yard. Thus far she and her asst Zack have been wonderfully helpful.

Umm...yuck! First, the decor is so outdated it feels dirty and old. Second, my order was delivered wrong. By the time it came out correctly everyone else was done eating. The burger was greasy and flavorless. I didn't finish it and won't be back.

What everyone says about this place is true-the food is NOT what you should come here for. The ambiance is fun and the view is beautiful. I even got my husband to go down the slide!! The food- think Sizzler quality. Server was pleasant.   First-there's lots of big groups that go here. It took forever for the food to arrive. They brought out some salad and Indian fry bread and biscuits while we waited. They topping for the breads were margarine or cinnamon margarine. Sorry, but at these prices I expect butter. The salad was ok. It was drenched in ranch dressing over what looked liked that bagged salad you but at the grocery store with a could shreds if carrot and cabbage in it. The goulash was topped with a lot of croutons. A LOT! The flavor was fine but I recommend dressing on the side.   Our tables order included the vaquero with was sirloin with enchiladas. The sirloin was ordered medium well but it was cooked to the point if being leathery. The enchiladas might have been "ok" (not good) but were sitting on too of a plate full of baked beans, as were the corn on the cob and steak. All the flavors congealed into each other. Yuck!  The filet mignon was also cooked until they were sure it was dead, really dead! They insisted there was pink in it but we couldn't see it. They offered to being us each another steak but since it took 30 minutes to get the first one, we were done.   They did bring free apple pie with ice cream to make it up to us. It was huge and decent but wouldn't crave it.   If friends from out of state visit, I would bring them here but only order appetizers (snake and cactus for the adventurous) or dessert.  Save your money while enjoying the view, slide and dancing.

Good home style cooking with plenty of comfort foods. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, the have many choices to choose from. Lots of options for sides.  My moms favorite is the fried okra. We always go home with leftovers. My husband thinks the chocolate cola cake is crazy good. Service is always friendly and the place is hopping.

The burgers are preformed frozen patties, with not a lot of flavor. It's a brioche bun that's kind of hard. Fries tasted like they were frozen, definitely nothing special. To make a "meh" meal worse, I only drink iced tea and water (no soda or coffee). The iced tea tasted very old and nasty. I tried to get water from their soda machine but only a quarter of water cup dribbled out.   On the up side, service was friendly and the fry sauce was good.

We were a little leery after reading a couple of the reviews but decided to give its whirl. The price is a little steeper than some places but after trying the food....quality and flavor of the food made it 100% worth it.   I LOVE chicken piccata but rarely find it on the menu, when I do, I'm often disappointed. In the past, Cheesecake Factory was my favorite. They have now been usurped! Charleston's piccata is soooo good! I try to stay away from carbs and was able to substitute the noodles. I chose the burgundy mushroom since the dish already had mixed veggies on the plate. The mushrooms were so delish!  My husband had the French dip sandwich with mashed potatoes. He said it was the best French Dip he's ever had.   Service was great. We were pleased that when we asked if any meat was used in the gravy, he said no meat but offered to check what they used as a base. Turns out it was bacon fat. He brought a sample back with him too. My husband is not a pork fan so he skipped the gravy but still thought the  potatoes had excellent flavor.   Final note: the parking lot was packed but we were seated quickly and service was prompt. Servings were large and we both brought home plenty of leftovers.   We will absolutely come back, it's totally worth the drive.

After waking to a tree split for the storm last night, we took a quick trip here to buy a chainsaw. We were greeted when we walked in and taken to the saws and someone else stopped to offer assistance while we perused our option. Their coupons are great. We really appreciate their no hassle policies with coupons. So many places have a zillion restrictions where Harbor Freight doesn't.

The best part of this restaurant are the people. Owner and employees alike are very friendly. As far as the food-customize your chicken or burgers to how you like it. My husband had ordered here once before and didn't like it. Standard burger is salad dressing and double cheese. He didn't prefer the fries. This time he went with ketchup, no cheese, lettuce and tomatoes. He said it was very good. He was glad there wasn't cheese to block the flavor of the meat. I had chicken with green chile and cheese. Good but very messy. I had a bite of peach pie that was very flavorful with big pieces of peach. Yum!  As for the response from the owner... Proof of how warm and friendly they are.  I believe in diversifying so next time-pancakes with bacon! I haven't read any reviews on the pancakes yet. Inquiring minds want to know!

Wow. How to review this place?  The pizza is about 3/5, salad good but it's one trip with the tiniest plate ever. Their service is counter service only but the show was a kick. Not what we expected at all but we had fun. For that alone, we will probably come back. It was fun to watch the crowd get into it and clap along with the organ.

Need a cheap phone quickly for a reduced cost? This is your place! Service was prompt and professional. One star down because I tried to call and kept getting a voicemail that was so staticky he could have  been telling me to jump off a roof, the building burned down or anything and I wouldn't have known it. Umm-a business that sells phones should have a voice message you can hear.

It's a small market but we enjoy it. They only have a couple of organic fruit/veggie vendors. My husband loves Molly's Tamales and Baked with Love. The organic beef is priced better than Whole Foods and Sprouts plus it's not shipped from Uruguay like Sprouts. There's always a couple of food carts if you want to grab dinner. Some vendors aren't there weekly so it's a good idea to pick up their card so you can call ahead to check what weeks they'll be there. It's kid friendly and a picturesque little spot.

We had a great time. Even my 16 yr old niece enjoyed the tour of the mines, mystery house and short train ride around town. Only downside is it's summer so many businesses were closed. My niece REALLY wanted to see the snake, spider, scorpion display but they were closed. She's said she's coming back for Christmas and wants to visit here just for that (and hopefully some gun fights). Fun day!

My first visit to Boston Market in probably 10+ year. The service was good, the turkey was recommended and it was very moist and tasty. Sadly the tea was nasty. Completely undrinkable. I'm not sure when it was made but I'm guessing not today. I only drink tea or water so this is frustrating for me. It's hot so I order the biggest drink they have then end up filling it with free water. Ugh. Atmosphere-pretty non existent. It's not inviting at all. Will I be back? Maybe? Dunno...  Update:  Then I arrive home and give my husband the cookie he wanted. He takes one bite and pulls out a hair that's baked into the cookie. Nasty! Change that to 'No, I won't eat here again'.

Our table had a LOT of food so I'll break it down by item: Fried mozzarella: very good. We enjoyed the marinara and ranch dipping sauces too.   Mashed Potatoes: tasty! We had turkey gravy on the side and it was good too  Chicken Fried Steak: I didn't think the crust had much flavor but my husband liked it. The cube steak was good (we had the side of turkey gravy vs sausage)  Biscuit: large, soft, fluffy and yummy  Broccoli: ok. Nothing special.   Turkey sandwich: very good! my husband usually doesn't like "carved" turkey. He usually thinks it's too thick and dry but he really liked their turkey. That's a big compliment! I do like turkey and thought it was very tasty.   Onion Rings: undercooked a little but would be really good if cooked completely.   Service: good but nothing unique. The place was hopping but she kept up  Atmosphere: we loved it! Good oldies music and decor.   They have a dessert case that looked amazing. The cakes are HUGE but we didn't try anything. Tempting!

For street tacos, these were pretty good. My husband liked the carne asada. I took part of the cashiers suggestion and had a carnitas taco, plus a chicken (my choice). I should've listened to her fully. The carnitas was off the hook! Chicken was fine. Just...fine. Only real downfall was the iced tea was old, which tastes nasty. The cashier gladly gave me a Bottle of water instead.

We went to check it out for as possible business breakfast my husband has coming up. The environment is very loud so he won't use it for business but the food was good. He had orange creme French toast that he loved but way it would be way to rich for my preference. The bacon and eggs were good but I was most pleased with the fresh fruit that accompanied it, ripe and tasty! Another had the waffle and turkey sausage. She said the waffle was good but nothing special. She didn't like the turkey sausage flavor. Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry. They offer mimosas and other morning drinks if you're looking for that. We weren't but it's nice to have the option.

They have the best fast food pretzels and a good selection of flavors. Our favorites are the jalapeño pretzel and the cheddar stuffed pretzel bites.   Sadly, they've changed the cheese dip over the years. What used to be so good it was a "must" is now the cheap neon colored processed cheese. It's nasty, kills a great pretzel and a waste of money.

My mom and I went here yesterday prior to a movie. We had 45 minutes and thought a sandwich spot was a good choice.    My mom ordered the broccoli soup and a half sandwich. I ordered the chicken pomegranate salad because, when I asked the cashier about it she rolled her eyes into the back of her head and said "Oh my gosh, it's soooo good. Everybody loves it!"  She was right, it was "soooo good"!  I took a bite of my moms soup and we both agreed its delish! My mom said her sandwich was fresh and tasty too, but I can't remember what she ordered.   The black passion fruit tea and the green guava were excellent. My mom added water to the coffee because it was bitter.  Down side is it took a loooong time for the food to arrive and we had to wolf down our meal. I simply can't imagine why it took so long for salad, soup and a half sandwich. The 10 minutes of previews were over and the movie was starting.  My mom wanted to give it a 3 star because of the coffee and long wait but the quality of the food deserves a 5 so I compromised at 4.

I often bring my friend and clients here for lunch because the food is fresh and flavorful.   This time the server was SO RUDE to my friend I was embarrassed and shocked.   My friend had never been here before and ordered incorrectly for the pick 2. The girl explained it but her tone was a tad short while she explained it. When my friend corrected her order (she thought fruit came as a side), she thought she heard the girl read the order back with a sandwich rather than salad so my friend repeated that she didn't want the sandwich. The cashier gave her a HOSTILE look and said. "YEAH. I. KNOW." with a totally inappropriate tone. I was so shocked I almost said something to her. I probably should have because I'm still completely offended.   I was going to give an extra star because the food is REALLY good but what appeared to be the manager overheard me say "oh my gosh! She was SO rude. I'm so sorry!" to my friend, yet didn't ask what happened or offer an apology. The rude girl at the register was so awful it left my stomach feeling ill. -10 stars for her. 0 stars for the manager who was unconcerned that two customers were walking away from the register with unhappy stunned faces.  I may need to rethink bringing friends and clients here. I'm so embarrassed!!

I hesitated coming back to this location but it was the closest to our events that day. Service was much better today,possibly because it was Mother's Day. The food, as always, was high quality. My husband enjoyed his Asian salad, the Lon ricotta pancakes had a delicate lemon flavor that was good, although obscured if you put syrup or strawberries on them. Probably would prefer simply with whipped cream. The chicken pomegranate salad was excellent.

This spot has some big pluses and some bigger minuses.  On the plus side - the food quality is decent. Environment is cool The flavor of the steak street tacos was pretty good too. Server was pleasant but not trained to ensure customers concerns are addressed.   On the negative - EVERYTHING has chipotle flavor. Even Chipotles restaurant doesn't have this much Chipotle flavoring. I do not like the smoky flavor of chipotle. My husband doesn't mind it but this was even too much for him.   Guac - chipotle Tabasco (luckily we asked for no Tabasco so the guac wasn't ruined)  SW Caesar - Chipotle dressing. It wasn't listed as having it. We probably took 3 bites between us of the salad. Wasted $$. We did mention to the waiter that it was Chipotle dressing (which I'd previously told him I don't like so to keep anything Chipotle off the food). He said "Oh really?"  Didn't offer to replace or refund it either.   Street Tacos: asked for no chipotle sauce but it came with it anyway.   On a previous visit: Shrimp and Guac Tostada bites. Asked for no Chipotle sauce but it came with it still on it.   Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad- husband says it was great. No idea if it had chipotle sauce. If not - it's a minor miracle.   Seriously!! ENOUGH with chipotle mayo on every dang thing you serve. Diversify your flavors please. After 2 visits, we are done. Tired of paying for food we won't eat. (We didn't ask for items to be replaced. The first visit I was with clients and didn't want to fuss. Second visit I scraped it off the tacos because my husband was hungry and the waiter wasn't around. Second visit part 2 (the SW salad) I told the waiter and he shrugged it off,saying "Its a Smoky flavor but not chipotle". Chipotle IS smoky. Argh.   Could easily be a 4 star if they made orders right and tried other sauces on their food.   OH! The salsa is chipotle too.

Tonight I would give it 4 stars. It was a busy night yet we were seated sooner than anticipated and served promptly. Good quality ingredients served hot. Flavorful dishes. Server was very good, we forewarned him we like a lot of their special sauce and he prepared  a small bowl rather than their usual tiny bowl of it. Nice not to feel like you need to harass the busy server for more sauce. We will be back!

They have the BEST steaks. Tender and flavorful. I like the veggie mix. The potatoes and rice my husband gives a thumbs up. My only disappointment is the salad. I'm not sure why but the salads seem just so-so. I love salads and cant put my finger in it but they don't quite hit the yummy spot. Bread is good. appreciate greatly that you can get the filet mignon without bacon (why mess with the flavor if a great steak). The coup de gras is the key lime pie. I'm not a huge key lime person but there's is TO DIE FOR, so rich and creamy. As for the other desserts, we have tried a few and they've been delicious (except the mango creme brûlée which was bland). All in all, our favorite steak spot locally.

The quality of our dinner was excellent. We had Tom Kha Ga soup that was very tasty. If you're not familiar with it - try it! FYI- not all of the roughage inside the soup is meant to be eaten, just to flavor. Cashew chicken and pad se ew were both very good an authentic. The mango sticky rice is always wonderful and a wonderful treat.   I will say that if you like super saucy Americanized Thai, you might be disappointed.

Yes, there's a wait. If you don't want to wait, then choose another restaurant. We wandered around the area, periodically checking back in which made the wait pleasant.   My husband who IS the Burger Miester gave the burger a 5/5. Very rare rating! Pancakes-fluffy but flavor wasn't anything unique (Gilbert House keeps the pancake crown).  Fried potatoes-husband loved them and took mine home for leftovers.  Bacon, Avocado, tomato, cheese scramble was fresh and tasty. Would order again! Biscuits-ridiculously good. Moist, warm, flakey. YUM! Cinnamon Roll- table consensus was it's ok. Little bit of a lemon flavor? We wouldn't order it again.  Server was very friendly and good. Decor is old time charm.

Very friendly place! We enjoyed the people and the decor. My husband enjoyed the burger. So many burgers are either pre made frozen patties or seasoned until they no longer taste like hamburger. The meat on this burger tasted fresh with just the right amount of seasoning (salt and pepper). The prickly pear chicken  was a nice twist on chicken, making the chicken delicately sweet with a mild cheese to compliment it. For sides we tried the jalapeño Mac n cheese and jalapeño mashed potatoes. Tasty options when you're not in the mood for fries. We will certainly be back to try other menu items, not only because of the food but because of the people.

While the outside looks a little sketchy, it's apparent when you are there that it's very clean and the Shack is part of the name and not really rundown like it appears.   My husband didn't prefer the lightly Coated fries in the California burrito but the meat was pretty good. The carne asada was milder than he is used to but good quality.   I think there was a breakfast burrito called the El Paso with shredded beef. That really hit the spot but could've used more green chilies!  If you're a biscuits and gravy fan, they were pretty good too.   The soft taco shell wasn't cooked enough but the ingredients were good.  Guessing that was a one off situation rather than typical.   All in all, it was good and definitely worth a second trip to find each persons favorite dish.

Our first visit here, we came because of the great reviews and weren't disappointed. They have great music, throwback atmosphere was enjoyable and service was prompt and friendly.   The burger was definitely better than your typical burger. It had a soft bun, and it was served nice and hot. You watch them make your burger and choose toppings as you go. The horseradish mustard was a definite plus!   Toppings were fresh. Bacon was cooked perfectly.   Fries were good-shoe string style. Onion ring style isn't what we prefer but many enjoy the crumbly coating type - we prefer beer battered.   Worth a visit if you're in the area.

I've been to several 24 Hour Fitness locations over the years. The people here were friendly but the gym is small, dark and not as updated as the other 24 Hours I've been to. Very limited classes and many they want you to pay extra for.  I'm new to this area and seriously considering canceling at my next re-up (I've been a member for approx 10 yrs). I'm disappointed this is all 24 Hour has to offer in an area filled with people and newer gyms with more classes.

I'm not a coffee drinker and am definitely NOT a fan of all the hype. That being said, my cashier was very friendly and helpful. She suggested a pumpkin spiced latte tea (nonfat for me). It was great!! Very tasty and perfect for the rainy/monsoon day we were having. It was a comfortable spot for a quick meeting too.

Why is it impossible for people to figure out that is someone says "no onions" that by association that means "no pico de gallo" because it is made from tomatoes and...ONIONS!   On this particular visit i went through the drive thru as I was rushed and it was my only chance to eat before 3. I said "no onions", she said "it has pico de gallo" to this I replied "then no pico de gallo please". What did I receive? A completely in edible turkey taco with pico de gallo.   To add insult to injury the paper wrapper had so much liquid in it, it immediately   broke through the wrapper and dumped pico, cheese and turkey all overt lap.   Always lovely to go to an appointment smelling like a taco, stains in my shirt AND nothing to eat because 1/2 of it was on my lap and the other half still had onions on it.

We went on a day that had a monsoon (didn't expect that when we decided to go). We are crazy enough to find this super fun. We had to coax a few people away from metal enclosures since it was lightening, ran from lots of flying limbs and had the power in the entire city go out.   That being said, we enjoyed the layout. You feel and are close to many animals. The aquarium was really nice. The animals  seemed well cared for. The storm caused downed trees and fences but it appeared cleanup and securing the animals happened fairly quickly.   Wish it wasn't so far away so we could visit more often. The 303 freeway is making it more accessible.

Fun throw back to the western burger shacks of yesteryear. I read many poor reviews for service but ours was friendly and prompt. Possibly the poor service is San issue specifically in the bar?  The burger was large and tasty. The chicken breast sandwich was very large, juicy and flavorful. I liked the veggie cart to put my own toppings on it. It was clean and everything looked fresh.  Tons of options for non alcoholic fountain drinks including 3 different iced teas which always makes me happy. My only disappointment was I ordered the chicken and salad special but they must not have heard me because I received fries instead of salad. I would've swapped it out but the line was long at that point. Promising side is I now know to order no sides next time as the chicken was more than enough.

We stopped by here to get a small bite for a friend. What a treasure we happened to find! I wish we would've had more time and hunger to try more than just cannoli. The Cannoli was good!  Be prepared for the quintessential group of older guys leering at you and making appreciative noises - Seriously felt like we popped out of a movie set for Goodfellas.

Yummy charming spot. I am stuck on their Mexican Chicken salad, I wish I could remember the exact name but it's on the middle left of the back of the menu. Lol  My husband loves the carne asada and a friend said the fried ice cream and tortilla soup were very good too. Prices can be a tad high but it's in a tourist spot.   Outdoor patio is charming and highly recommended.

I am a huge breakfast fan. When I see lots of positive reviews for breakfast, I have to try them.   I don't know if we ordered wrong or what, but we were not impressed AT ALL! My husbands burger was flat out disgusting. It was some preformed frozen beef-like product.   The biscuits were bland and very floury. The chicken fried steak was average. Service was good but nothing outstanding.   I'll be honest, it wasn't good enough that we would even bother trying it again.

Very friendly and efficient service. We appreciated that they were upfront about fees and liability without pressuring us. The truck was ready for us when we arrived; pulled up front, clean with a full tank. Prices were standard,

Quaint little local spot. It's older and definitely a bit rundown but atmospheric in a fun way. The old plumbing in the bathroom does smell so be prepared for that.   Services was friendly. My Mom and I split an omelet. They were very patient with weird special orders (my mom and I don't like the same omelet ingredients so we asked for some ingredients on the side). The omelet was good, as were the biscuits biscuits and gravy.  My husband enjoyed everything on the carne asada plate very much. The chips and salsa at the table were okay. For me, the sauce/salsa was a bit lacking.   We would come back if in the area.

The atmosphere is old school cafe, not cafeteria but cafe. Cute and quaint. The hamburger was big, tender and juicy. One of the best in the local area according to the burger miester (aka my husband). The accompany steak fries were reportedly "golden delicious".   They have hummus appetizer with Mediterranean spiced hamburger on top. While it might sound strange, it was amazingly yummy.   I had the combo with chicken salad half sandwich, cup of chili and small Caesar. Way too much food to eat but the chicken salad was very good. The Caesar was solid too. Chili wasn't as spicy as I prefer, but was obvious quality. The iced tea was fresh and the service excellent.   My husband said we must come back here. Soon!

We did come back for breakfast. My husband said the pancakes were hands down the best pancakes he's ever had. Also the hash browns were buttery and very very good. On the flip side, the eggs on the omelet were paper thin - in the future I would order eggs and your meat of choice instead of an omelette. Service was excellent as always.

Update: we came back for breakfast. My husband said the pancakes were hands down the best he's EVER had! The hash brown were buttery and excellent too. That being said, the eggs in the omelette were paper thin. I'd recommend getting eggs and bacon instead.

On our first trip I ordered a chili cheese burger. The burgers were huge and the chili kept sliding off. It was so messy I couldn't enjoy it. The place was packed, the line was long and my overall feeling was "meh". I didn't plan to return.   Recently I went back with my brother when there was a small, reasonable line (and he wanted a burger). This time I went with a basic cheeseburger. My brother had a bacon cheeseburger with fries. We both enjoyed the fresh meat and toppings. They also had a fruity  iced tea which not only tasted great but was very fresh. It's now back "on the list" of burger spots!

We really like our room and the bed was comfy. The hotel is conveniently located. This isn't the place to necessarily hang out in Vegas but it's a great place to stay for the price.

We sat outside due to how noisy it was inside. We were soon forgotten. The pizza was decent but not noteworthy. One was so overcooked that it was like a cheese crisp and very dry. The other pizza was cooked correctly but nothing amazing about the flavor. Probably the best part was a pretty cat that hangs around outside without being bothersome.

Gazpacho, Deluxtini and a mini burger were my late lunch selection.  Gazpacho was good but a little too salty Deluxtini also good but wouldn't crave one. There was plenty in the shaker to refill my glass plus some. Nice! Made the $11 drink a great value.  Mini burger was fresh, flavorful and the perfect size.  Server was a pleasure, friendly and helpful Dining al fresco with misters always makes me happy.  I'll be back so my husband "The  Miester"  can try their burgers too. I'm always on the lookout for the perfect burger for him!

We had the pulled pork sliders. They were very tasty and hit the spot. The margarita was ok. Nothing memorable, just a margarita. We ate in the bar to skip the wait. Service was good with some interesting (aka annoying) people watching. We would've gone back after our concert that night but food was shut down already.

We were looking for another restaurant when we walked past Sauce. We had a long active day and were hungry and tired. This wasn't at all what I had in mind but my husband thought it looked good and I was hungry.   Long story short, I went from exhausted, hungry and not looking forward to a meal that wasn't even close to what I was desiring to immensely pleased. We both loved our meals and drinks. Service was good too.   We will make the drive occasionally since there isn't one closer but we really wish there was one on the east side!

Come early or be prepared to wait. The line often extends out the front door. It took me a couple trips to find my thing but we both enjoy the chopped brisket. My husband likes the baked potato with brisket on the side. The potato is big enough for 2-4 meals. Best BBQS we've had outside of Texas.

Family from around the country came to visit for Christmas. To make memory we decided to see a play. We had all been to A Christmas Carol before and were expecting a pleasant show but nothing special. We were so wrong. We all loved it! Loved the way they worked the circular stage., the acting, the music... We will definitely be back!

Freedom dip is tasty and HUGE! The burger was also good. Overall a good meal with quality ingredients. If you're not the bar type (we aren't) make sure to come during the day. I'm pretty sure it's a party palace at night. Service was good too. If you get offended easily be forewarned I was called honey, sweetie, sweetheart or something thereof by almost everyone that worked there. I wasn't offended but I was amused.

They were busy but moved quickly to get everyone through the line. I tried a margarita from there for the first time. I expected sub-quality and watered down. I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. It did take them awhile to make it but they offered a but one get one free as compensation. I hadn't even mentioned that they were slow so I was impressed. Love the addition of brown rice to the menu and thrilled they're going GMO free.

I appreciate that Sam's Club has smaller portion options to purchase compared to costco. Perfect for a smaller family. We really like their selection of outdoor furniture. We LOVE that we can use our credit card. We usually buy gas there too. Self checkout us a nice option. Prices seem comparable to slightly better than Costco. Customer service isn't quite up to Costco but it's not bad either.

We really enjoyed this place! The service was very friendly and informative. Portions are huge!!  The carnitas and carne asada meat was very flavorful and tender. The super taco is filled with lots of meat and beans. Usually, thats my preference but I think I would get a regular taco next time so the beans don't distract from the meat.  Definitely worth a visit! It went to the top of our taco joint list.

They have excellent prices, good quality and good selection. The employees are always polite and helpful (although you may need to look for one simply because they're busy). I also very appreciative that they hire disabled employees. That would get them 6 stars if could (plus he was very helpful and friendly). They also offer assistance with loading without having to ask). Wish there was one closer to home.

Bought a bike and asked at customer service if they had any twine that we could tie the trunk down with (note: this was after asking 3 others who 'didn't know' then waiting 10 minutes at customer service).   I was told it's a liability issue for them to give me twine. Of course, I can buy it and it's not a liability. Seriously!?! Every Christmas tree store, furniture stores etc will give you twine and help you tie it down. If you're buying from Walmart you have to buy it, take it to your car, load the item yourself (in 109 heat), then tie it down. We had already reduced our Walmart shopping drastically in the last few months.  Because this store and their service is so trashy and awful, you've successfully ensured you've lost our business. You've taken enough of our funds without giving anything back, like courteousy.   Oh yes - NEVER buy fruit here. Packaged items have been moldy. Fresh items rot very fast and have very little flavor. Winco has much better prices and quality.

The place is family run by a philly bread family and everyone is really nice. The sandwiches are (reportedly) true Philliy cheesesteaks but if you want your whiz on top, you need to ask, otherwise you'll get cheddar.   As previously noted by other reviewers, it can get loud with the chopping sound. If they ask if you want red sauce, say yes. It's not spicy but adds good flavor to it.   If any former philly friends come to visit, I'll bring them here to see what they think. Pretty sure they'll give a two thumbs up.

Our favorite Chick-Fil-A. Polite, friendly service. Excellent food. The chicken strips are always perfectly cooked (other locations tend to be over done). The chicken soup is perfect when under the weather and a bowl is big enough for two servings. Yummy!

Our table had a hamburger that was deemed fresh and tasty. A green Chile omelette with a very nice green chile sauce (it kept being stolen as a French fry dip) and pancakes with a side taste of the apple cider dressing (sweet and cinnamony). Everything was deemed very good and worthy of a return trip.   Our server was very patient and friendly with our abundance of questions. The setting was charming. We dined outside, enjoying a beautiful day, flowers and cute finches watching for stray food. We will be back.

The food was ok. Portions were ample. We like spicy and this was far from it. I would give 3 stars but my brother had leftovers the next day and got sick. We thought it was a fluke until my husband had a different leftover and also got sick.  We threw the rest away.

Lunch service was prompt. I let her know my time was limited so she explained which items I could order. My choice was the gyro which I really enjoyed. The meat was flavorful and tender and reasonably priced. The iced tea was meh. I could wish for a more authentic environment but that wouldn't keep me from coming back to try more items.

My husband and I ordered the plate for 2. Wow!! It was not only very tasty but huge! We both ate our full and took home 3 boxes of leftovers while leaving most of the salad there.   Here's the breakdown: Iced tea is strong! Water tastes filtered which I always appreciate  Salad is fresh and minty. All depends on your personal taste.  Hummus was topped with fresh parsley and cumin. The taste was very good.  Garlic sauce was also fresh and (of course) super garlicky (not our favorite but nothing wrong with it) Tahini - very good Rice - Soooo good!! The raisins on top were surprisingly yummy  Chicken Kabob- excellent  Chicken shawarma - excellent  Steak kabob - excellent  Grape leaves- the only ones I've ever liked. Normally I find them to be quite nasty  Falafel - by far the best we've ever had. Obviously fresh made while we waited.   All in all - a surprising treat. We will be back and bring guests.  Service was good too.

We really appreciate successful family run restaurants and this is one of them. They were very friendly, accommodated special orders and you could tell they were making the food to order and not just re-heating pre-made food in the back.y husbAnd thought the carne asada was flavorful. Chicken in Mexican restaurants sometimes seems like it's made with whatever meat is leftover but this appeared to be all white meat chicken, not dry or flavorless. This was our first visit. We will be back and I'll be willing to try something more unique now that I trust their kitchen.

WARNING- my brother bought 7 cruise tickets through Norwegian Cruises with insurance that he was promised the tickets could be refunded "at any time". They told him this over the phone (yet never sent him info on the insurance).   One couple cancelled so he tried to use his insurance for the promised refund. They didn't stand by their salespersons word and only refunded $2500 of a $3500 ticket. He escalated it and they still refused, although they did offer $750 off his next cruise...as if any of us would take another cruise with them after their blatant false sales techniques.  We had two cruises we were planning to do through Norwegian. Their loss! On our cruises we had excursions for 5 at each stop, two of us spent major $$ on art plus drinks, games etc. Norwegian your failure to stand behind your poorly trained and/or lying salespeople has successfully lost you far more than $1000. Yes, this is posted on my FB and some of my friends pages too.

We've been here a few more times. The places is always super busy with staff rushing to try to keep up. Pointers to them for keeping their smiles throughout it.   My husband loves the turkey croissant sandwich. I enjoy their salad bar, which has a good variety of options. If you need a little protein you can add meat. I like the Tina salad with egg (there's not too much mayo in it which is a plus).   Good selection of iced teas, drinks etc. The only downfall is they're so busy that it's chaotic....tables pushed around haphazardly, loud, and you may need to bus your own table. Although I have to give them a thumbs up - they saw us busing a table to eat and brought us a cookie and an apology.

I'll admit, after reading the reviews we were dubious but willing to give it a try. The garlic knots were adequate but nothing special but they were a free appetizer so why complain?  Now the pizza-delish!! Unlike many places that only put a sprinkle of cheese, this one had copious amounts of cheese melting over the sides. Yummy!!!  The crust was also tasty and not too thick. This place is for those of us who love REAL NY pizza    Our server was also on top of refilling drinks etc. Definitely a spot we will return to.

We ordered a salad and 2 small pizzas. The salad was pretty basic. Not bad other than the blue cheese dressing had huge chunks of cheese in it.  Typically I like this but there seemed to be more cheese than dressing in the plastic cup they gave us.  Possibly because they were a small size, the edge of the crust was very thick and fluffy while the center was flat. This caused all the toppings to congeal into a sloppy mush in the center, with the majority of the pizza being dry.   Additionally, my pizza was very garlicky and I'm one of the few who isn't a garlic lover (part vampire?). I asked if the sauce had diced garlic in it (so I would know if I needed to order a different sauce in the future) but the waitress said it wasn't and possibly the garlic on my husbands pizza (he had the olive oil and garlic sauce) had dropped onto my pizza too. If so, they dropped a LOT of garlic on it (gags).   The waitress was friendly and asked if we wanted her to have the pizza fixed but we declined as my mouth would need a bottle of scope and a tube of crest before I could taste anything but garlic again (and our food was already boxed and bill paid).   Upon leaving, I stopped in the restroom. There wasn't any tissue in the stall or any form of a backup roll.  I won't go into detail but I believe the word "gross" tells all that needs to be told.   My husband gave his pizza 3/5 stars because of the dry fluffy outside and the goopy center. Also because he ordered light spinach and spent his meal pealing spinach off it.

NYPD responded to my less than positive review on yelp promptly. I thought that it was cool and showed that they really care about their customers.  As requested in their response, I emailed them my contact info so they could find out more about my experience. Never heard back from them. I guess it's just a gimmick to make people reading yelp think they care. Instead of impressing me, that gimmick has dropped my review to a 1 star. You've officially lost our business. Grimaldi's it shall be.  After the last post I received a call from their office. She was genuine, pleasant and thanked me for the review. They took the time to shop the restaurant after my review. They learned that some items were being prepared improperly and that my order was placed incorrectly.  They're sending us gift certificates to try them again. Because she seemed sincere, we will try them again.

There is something about his place that I find relaxing and charming. I can't quite place my finger on why, but it's a place I enjoy scheduling meetings or stopping in for a quick bite. Their pomegranate tea is unsweetened and tastes fantastic. I could easily become addicted to it. Ice also had a cooper sandwiches and they were good too. Usually it's filed with people on their computers, but I prefer to step outside and relaxing in the sun. Definitely worth trying if you haven't been.

The food is fresh and delicious. Probably the only downside is if you pay separately then the meals come out separately, sometimes 5-10 minutes later. Other than that, very enjoyable meals.

We were here when there was a happy hour special on carnitas and carne asada tacos. The place was pretty busy so we were surprised that the meat was over cooked, as if it had been sitting out awhile.   I ordered my taco without onions but it arrived with red onions on it. The cashier insisted there weren't onions on it. It went so far that I picked out an onion and put it up to her face and said "smell it! It's an onion!" (Meanwhile my husband is enjoying a good laugh) She did smell it, apologized and asked the kitchen to remake it. I know minimal Spanish but I could tell they were arguing about it with her. Then they smell it and agree to make me a new taco. Seriously - couldn't you SEE the red onions or at least look before arguing about it?  The hatch chile salsa is spicy but good. Red was typical, nothing special. My husband said his carne asada was dry and bland.   Based on dry meat and arguing about what they're serving me, not sure we will be back.

Honestly, I love this place. Everyone is so polite and well trained. The food is excellent (and they've made a recent commitment to healthier/no GMO. Yay!!). I LOVE being able to get chicken for breakfast (their biscuits are dangerously tasty), we love their chicken and I have recently have a new love affair with their market salad. Keep being awesome and THANK YOU for moving toward no GMO, it's much appreciated by your hard core Chick Fil A loving customers.

Expensive bland very Americanized Mexican food. Probably good for tourist who like mile Pace salsa FRM the grocery store. Probably what bothered me the most was all the rescued on expenses fur adding things like green chiles $1 onions $1 cheese $1.75. Our iced tea was $3. Not to of this works prices but kinda high. Service was ok, they got us what we asked for but without a smile or any enthusiasm. Beautiful location though!

According to my husband, they serve the best sliders in the valley, with hand formed thick juicy patties. The Aioli had just the right amount of flavor and the bun was warm and tasty. This will be his new go to slider place!  My side salad and iced tea were both fresh and tasty. The French dip was only okay to me. The Au jus is spicy but not salty and the meat lacked flavor. That being said, my husband added salt to it and gobbled it up.   The pretzel appetizer was good but the cheese dip tasted like it came out of a jar. The ground mustard dip was definitely the better of the two.   I would personally rate them at a 3 but my husband loved his and gave an overall strong 4/5 but 5 for the sliders.

Thank you for having organic meat that's not shipped in from another country! I WISH you would open a store in Gilbert (near the SanTan mall would be awesome!) I only come here periodically because I pass 4 Sprouts on the way to you. 4 stars instead of 5 because: your turkey sandwich meat looks processed, you don't have pre-packaged almond butter (that's not in a jar) for when your machine breaks down (really frustrating when I've driven that far and have to go back to Sprouts for it) plus there's a few other items I have to buy at Sprouts because you don't carry them.

This may have been our weirdest service experience ever.  Before we get to that, let's talk about the food. My husband ordered the tacos al carbon ($20). The taste was good but not traditional and they were served on flour tortillas. I had the fajitas tres with chicken, steak and bacon wrapped shrimp, which were recommended by the waitress. ($24). The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious. The other items were also good but not memorable. We also had table side guac as a starter ($12).   Now I'm going to backup up and talk about the service. When we sat down the waitress asked us if we wanted drinks. We both wanted water to start. When she delivered the water she dropped them off fairly rapidly and moved on. Upon taking a sip, my husband asked how my water tasted, which was fine. He had me taste his and it was soda water. Odd...  On her return she gave him a new water per our request and took our drink order. We ordered one diet soda and table side guacamole. When she returned she brought him iced tea. Okay - double weird. Then she began to make the guac. We asked for lime and onions on the side, which she did for us (she was consistently friendly). What we got from our table side was 2 avocados halves mashed up with a dollop of tomatoes on top. That's it. We saw cilantro on her cart but there wasn't any in the guac and the only tomatoes were the dollop. Pretty weird and expensive guac even with the onions and lime on the side.   While she was making the guacamole I asked her about the fajitas tres, which she said  as her favorite. After dropping off the guac she walked away. We saw her take orders at the next table. Later she dropped off my meal -without ever taking my husbands the order! The weirdness continued with people picking up one of the two different salsas they serve without asking, but not replacing it. When our waitress did replace it, she gave us the wrong one.   We could go on but suffice it to say it was weird, especially for a higher end restaurant. So to sum it up - the food was good but expensive for the service we received and the weird guacamole. Will we be back....that remains to be seen, but my guess is no.

Yummy! Come hungry, they're very big. Excellent bread, quality meat without loads of fat in it, options for cheese and toppings. Tried the Wiz topping for the first time. It adds creaminess to it but probably won't be my first choice unless I'm in the mood. We each special ordered our meals and they were accurate. Fries are coated which I liked but isn't my husband favorite. Tea wasn't great but that's minor issue. Restaurant was clean, service fast and friendly. We will be back.

I was hesitant to come after reading some of the reviews. I'm glad I decided to give them a whirl after all.   The food was good! My husband had a very moist and tasty filet mignon. I thoroughly enjoyed the salad bar. It was simple but had all the items I enjoy. Refill your non alcoholic drinks at a self serve station.   For entertainment they had a singing/guitar playing "retired cowboy". His voice had range and his repertoire was vast. We lounged outside and chatted while watching children frolic to the music and daddy's twirling their daughters around the dance area. As night fell, couples replaced children and bonfires began to light up the the night sky.   After reading the complaints about "propaganda" I was amused to see that it was either historical quotes (I saw everything from Ben Franklin to JFK) or passages from our constitution. Not sure why people find that so offensive.   All in all a pleasant way to enjoy an afternoon into evening.

Went back today with a friend. The tour was interesting and the speaker engaging. We enjoyed sampling oils and vinegars. Our lunch and Sangria was delicious. We had a great time.

For the overall score, I'll still give a 4 but it's really because I enjoy the environment, the olive oil and the classes.  The food itself is hit and miss plus on the expensive side.   The chicken fried steak was grisly and flavorless. We took maybe 4 bites and chose not to bring home leftovers (of anything). The potatoes with it were decent but nothing special. Bacon was yummy. Scrambled eggs I think we're cooked with an herbed olive oil?? Whatever it was, it was too oily and u would've preferred it without the hint of whatever was in there. We didn't finish those either.  Lemon Ricotta pancakes are huge and could feed a few. Unfortunately we didn't think they were very good. Just average and not worth the calories and carbs.   Overall, we dumped tons of food, paid a bigger than average breakfast bill and service seems to be average bordering on a little annoyed that we ask questions. We won't come back for breakfast but might for other events or to bring newbies to see it.   (note: food mentioned positively in previous reviews we still enjoy).

I arrived for a late lunch. Service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. Free wifi is always greatly appreciated. The yummy cookie to complete the meal us yummy and hard to resist. As usual for PB, the food was fresh and tasty. I love the multiple iced tea options, mango being my personal favorite.    One confusing note: what's with all the 15 min only parking outside the restaurant? Who can order and eat in 15 min? The other tenants are a pizza place, kids play land and laser hair removal. Can any of these be done in 15 min? Boggles me.   I do have one thing that bothers me about PB that keeps me frequenting Wildflower as my first option and PB as an emergency only backup. If I order a salad with my pick 2, minus the meat, I feel like there should be a price reduction. I don't care if it's only $.50 but it bugs me to pay $11 for a cup of soup or 1/2 sandwich and half salad when the salad is lettuce, dressing, a sprinkle of cheese and some nuts or whatnot.

I came back and ordered the eye opener with French toast (per my waitresses recommendation). YUMMY! Very flavorful without being too sweet. Service was very good and what a great choice. They go up a star for this great dish.

Since I can't give a 3.5, I'll round up. The restaurant was clean, the price was good and the service prompt with follow-ups and drink refills. The sushi was good. Nothing unique or amazing but good. I was a little surprised that the tuna on top of my roll was chopped/minced but the taste was good. Iced tea was big (which I appreciated!) but tasted a little old.

We were celebrating and decided to try someplace we've never been to before. The decor was lovely and ambiance romantic without feeling stuffy. Service was very good.   We shared a Caesar salad to start. It's was fresh, crisp and tasty. My husband had a filet mignon that was very tender and flavorful. I had lemon chicken. It was good but not excellent. The sauce wasn't lemony enough and a little shy on capers for my preference.  The accompaniments on our dishes were the same. I thought the vegetable were excellent, mashed potatoes were good. I had enough leftovers for us to share for lunch the next day. My husband had the creme brûlée dessert. Good flavor but served room temperature rather than chilled.  We will gladly come back for the steak. Next time I'll try their "light" chicken piccata to see if that is more to my liking.

Alicia is a huge asset to this location. You can tell are genuinely cares about her customers. She offers to go above and beyond to make sure they're not only satisfied but more than satisfied.   In the last few months we've noticed a difference at this location. People are friendly and more helpful.   As always - the food is fresh and tasty. Thank goodness lemon month (April) is only once a year or I might gain 20 lbs on the delicious lemon salad, caper pasta and lemon muffins. Dangerously yummy.

The only place we will get a fast food burger. Excellent burgers, quality ingredients, clean dining area, polite employees. If only I could love your fries. It took years to find them tolerable but mostly, easy way to avoid additional calories and fat.

Good for comfort food. Large portions so we have plenty of leftovers.  Sevice was ok, she seemed a disinterested/annoyed.   As for the food - both chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak were fresh and hot. We appreciated the meat free white gravy. Mashed potatoes were good. Salads fresh and plentiful. Rolls were good.   If we were in a comfort food mode, we would come back but we'd hope for a different waitress.

The Mission is fine dining in the quintessential casual Arizona atmosphere. Fine dining means exceptional food with exceptional service at exceptional prices. Fine dining also often means the entrees are small but the flavor combinations and quality will be unique and worth it.   The table side quac has a few unique twists like creamy garlic, chipotle sauce, jalapeños and green peppers and pumpkin seeds but since it's table side, you can specify what you do or don't want in it. We kept the chipotle sauce out, minimized the garlic and had the red onions on the side so only my husband ate those. It was tasty and perfectly suited to us.   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos. Yes, they're tiny but the quality was high and the flavors were a unique blend that worked very well. My husband had the tecate skirt steak tacos. The steak was very tender and flavorful. We would both order them again.   We both had water with our meal because it was hot and we felt dehydrated. As expected the water tasted fresh instead of the usual AZ "I just licked a rock" water that many restaurants serve. As we were paying, they were giving out their house blueberry lemonade alcoholic drink for free. I had one. Again, drinks are small and the flavor was fresh.     The bill for quac, water and 2 taco platters was about $50. I mention this not because I was surprised but because other reviewers expressed shock. We were both impressed enough with the flavor and quality of our small plates that we agreed we would come back for dinner some time, recognizing we will probably drop $100 on entrees alone, and double that if we have appetizers and dessert. As mentioned above, the service was excellent - prompt, frequent and friendly

Lovely restaurant with very good service. The filet mignon was tender and tasty, served with a delicious bernaise sauce. The top sirloin was also very good although I would not recommend the pecan and goat cheese topping. The topping is made with a heavy gravy that obscured the fine cut of the meat. Unless you're starving, skip the salad to save room for the wonderful veggie side dish. The mushrooms were delish!

This is a nice Chinese restaurant with large tasty portions. Not PF Changs nice nor PFCs version of Chinese food. I mention this because my husband loves PF Changs and now expects all Chinese restaurants to be like them. It's not, nor is it meant to be.   Now that that's out of the way, service was helpful and friendly. Portions were ample, veggies freshly cooked to order. I was very happy to be able to get brown rice (it may have cost $1 more but I honestly don't remember). Everything is made fresh so you can customize the food, which I appreciate. Meat wasn't fatty or grisly like I've experienced at other Chinese restaurants. All in all, a good meal.   I enjoyed it and will come back but probably not with my husband lol.

Wonderful hand tossed thin crust with fresh ingredients, baked in a brick oven. What else can you ask for? Ah yes, you can watch them being made from your table. It tastes excellent and served piping hot. Highly recommend you get there before you're hungry because there will be a wait to be seated. Don't let that stop you, it's worth the wait!

This place is very popular so we decided it was time to find out why. Unlike many restaurants, it's  not because of a unique vibe or new twist on menu options. Instead, it serves traditional breakfast and lunch options made with fresh, flavorful ingredients. It's a good place for an all American comfort food fix.

My first trip here was "eh" and I didn't come back for months. Recently I had a craving so I gave it another try. They actually have "real" Chicago dogs! Yummy!! It was perfect, inexpensive and my large iced tea was fresh. I'll probably come back more often now that I know where to get a great Chicago dog!

Our first experience with Cornish pastys. I have to admit we were both dubious enough that we briefly considered going elsewhere when we found out we couldn't customize our orders because the pastys are premade and partially cooked as it takes an hour to cook one from start to finish.   The ambiance was cool with a flavor of Britain - long communal tables, dark wood interior and bars to belly up to. Definitely doesn't feel like you're in Arizona anymore! We had instantly been transported to a pub in England.    The quality of food was extremely high. I won't tell you everything we ordered because we will sound like gluttons, but I will say we took home leftovers from every dish because the the portions are ample.   My husband had the oggie and I had the Mexican. Both were very good but my husband said he would order mine next time. The prices were very reasonable! We were shocked at how low our bill was and how many leftovers we had.    All in all, worth the visit. We look forward to bringing friends and family back to enjoy this unique and flavorful spot!

I wonder how many people miss this place because they're expecting a fast food place like Pita Pit?  I know I have for the last 4 months since moving to this area. I was pleasantly surprised to find a hip healthy restaurant inside. Per the waiters recommendation I ordered the Mahi Mahi w/ pita chips. I was pleasantly surprised and how flavorful and delicate it was for $10! It was served on a bed of green (spinach?) hummus with fresh salsa and a few pita chips around it. My only complaint is that I asked for nothing with onions on it. The dish did arrive with the salsa on top of the Mahi Mahi but I was able to pick the onions out without any onions pirating their way into my mouth. If they had, it could've easily ruined an otherwise delectable dish. I'm a touch of an anti-onion activist if that wasn't obvious. ;-). I'll be back with my husband next time. Great to be able get a healthy meal at a decent price.

The didn't have many if the quirky flavors I was told about (we were told their new chef isn't into them?) but service was friendly. You can try lots of samples. To me, it's so sweet I only get the smallest size and can barely finish that. Quality appears good.

First of all, I love the atmosphere of the ghost town and the view from the restaurant is gorgeous. We were hot, tired and hungry at the end of our day so we stopped in for a bite to eat.   The place was empty yet it took a long time for someone to take our order. We planned on getting a steak but the menu was very limited, my iced tea tasted old and the flies out numbered us 10-1.   We were still starving so we ordered a green chili quesadilla to hold us over until we were home or found a better option. The server was friendly but very busy at the bar while we were in the dining area. It took a long time for our order to come out on a disposable styrofoam plate. The green chilies were obviously canned and overwhelmed the quesadilla. It took forever to get our check. Extra star for ambiance but we won't be back here to eat.

We were pleasantly surprised by this spot. Service was super friendly and the food was plentiful. My husband says the happy hour chips n queso was to die for. My chicken sandwich was very good and I loved my broccoli option as a side (probably need to say "no butter" if you're trying to be healthy). They accidentally have me fries but showed up with the correct side quickly. My husband ate my fries and said they were ok - coated which isn't his kind of fry) He liked his hamburger but wasn't overwhelmed enough to crave it. It was so big that it was messy. Messy just isn't our thing.

We were having a goodbye luncheon for a friend. My sushi and salad combo was tasty and fresh. My friend enjoyed her salad. Our other friend said the turkey burger was "meh" and wouldn't order it again. Potstickers were good.   The downside is that I enjoy sitting outside. This patio was very noisy with too loud music over our heads and lots of traffic going by. Our server was cheerful and consistent. We would come back but skip the turkey burger.

My husband enjoyed his chicken salad sandwich. My meatloaf was slathered in gravy. The mashed potatoes were really good as was the broccoli. The two stars is because of the wasted $15 on two desserts.   First, they were obviously purchased at Costco but then we would've purchased the entire cake for $15. Instead we spent almost half that on one freezer burned piece of chocolate cake and an equally freezer burned pizookie. My husband asked if my meatloaf came from Costco too. My answer? It's entirely possible. Disappointing. I expect more from a family run restaurant. I'd prefer a limited menu with truly home cooked meals.

I switched my order from tacos to the California bowl with shrimp. To me, it lacked flavor and had way too much rice. I REALLY wish they had a brown rice option too. My husband said his steak fajitas were good. Would not order this item again but I still enjoy Rubios.

The piccata was fantastic! They happily allowed me to have chicken instead of veal. Make sure to ask them to add the capers. Yummy! The side of broccoli was okay. They add peppers and onions to it which is not my preference. Why mess with a good thing? The salad was ok, bread was excellent. The Chicken Bryan was very flavorful. We had creme brûlée for dessert which was also very good although we would've preferred to have had the top a bit more brûlée. Service was excellent, even the chef came by to check how the meal was. I also enjoyed my leftovers fir lunch today. We will be back!

Tasty and fresh. The ordering process can be a bit confusing and takes time to get used to but it's worth it. Tomato soup and fontina grilled cheese was perfect for cool cloudy day. Caesar salad was also good. Disappointed they were out of the mango tea but they have a few tea options to choose from (personally choose to go back to basic unsweetened ice tea). Would LOVE if stevia was sweetener option. I'll be back. My husband on the other hand, doesn't love their sandwiches and prefers to join only on a buy one coupon occasion.

Another "hit the spot" place. Gluten free options are wonderful. The tasty omelet was good without being greasy. My husband loved the pancakes.  Service was friendly. Iced tea was "meh". If you're looking for ambiance, this is not the place to go. If you're looking for a good breakfast, it is the place to go.

I was starving and wanted something quick and cheap. Based on reviews, I was dubious about coming here but a chicken taco sounded really good. I decided to live wild and try it out.   A happy surprise was that it's taco Tuesday so I was able to get two soft tacos for $.99 each! I expected them to be measly but there was enough meat in it that one would've been plenty. Better yet - they tasted good enough that I ate both. (Or maybe that's worse because I'm quite full now).  The iced tea was fresh, restaurant was clean and cheerfully decorated. They had a bar with four salsas, traditional veggies etc.   I could've taken pix to show how much meat was in the tacos but instead, I ate them.

My husband LOVES a good burger and is very picky. He gave this burger a 5. That is pretty rare! He also said we will definitely be back and was shocked we didn't already know about this place.   The meat is grass fed but was still flavorful and juicy. My husband said to make note that that the flavor is from the meat and not seasonings (he is NOT a fan of seasoned beef). The ingredients were fresh, the size ample (he got a double and couldn't finish it). He had Crinkle cut fries for a side. The fry sauce is good but has a seasoning in it that I didn't prefer. The chocolate shake is vanilla with chocolate sauce in it (yucky) rather than chocolate ice cream. I'm an iced tea fanatic. Their tea is pre made and comes from the soda dispenser. Not a fan of that because it tasted stale.   Final rating 5/5 from the Mr and 4/5 from me. Since I'm writing it, my opinion wins. ;-)

My hubby loves this place and would give a 5 star. I don't and would give it 3, although I do appreciate they're custom made to order. Fries are greasy and not my thing. Burgers are just average. My husband says the key is to let your burger sit in the wrapped aluminum for a couple minutes so everything gets steamy, cheese melts and bun softens. That would probably help. Yes there's free peanuts but I don't love peanuts so that doesn't add anything for me.  Hot dogs are a nice option.

$2 movies!! Not only that but there wasn't the typical cheap theater smell or general feel of dirty grubbiness. The wait for tickets is tad long because that's where they serve concessions too. Concessions are typical theater prices and options. Worth the wait for a date night for $4!

We really appreciate this theater. Everyone is very friendly and theaters are clean. If the theater is too full there is no problem getting a pass to come back another time. I REALLY appreciate that they often start movies with a welcome and (most importantly) tell people to turn their phones off to keep from ruining others experience. We did eat here once and the food was above average for a movie theater. Keep up the great job!

Ditto to previous reviewers. We ordered through CostCo. Delivery the first time was fine, although he tried to get us to up our water order.   Since then, every single order is wrong and my bill reflects the extra bottles dropped off that we did not order.  When we call to have them correct the order and pick up the extra bottles, between wait times on hold and having to escalate the issue because the normal call center people can't help us, it sucks up and hour of my life.   Currently I am staring at a bottle that was guaranteed to be picked up by yesterday. Today I've spent 45 minutes on the phone only for them to tell me they can't pick it up for two weeks. That's unacceptable to me so have to escalate it again. I'm currently awaiting a call back.   I highly recommend buying a dispenser at Walmart and filling bottles at Winco. Even if you buy a new dispenser every year, it would cost less. Technically it's more work but not when you add in the frustration level and time to correct bills and orders.

We had a great time and enjoyed the food and drinks.  We tried their staple pretzels with beer cheese as well as the antipasti platter, which features small portions of very expensive meats and cheeses at a reasonable price.   The deviled eggs were good but nothing amazing. We tried the fifty dollar bill drink and smashed Irishman, pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were.   We ended the night with the salted Carmel custard. My friend thought it was too sweet but I liked it.   Our service was outstanding. The only real negative was a hostess that my friend saw in the bathroom who didn't wash her hands but proceeded to fluff her hair and rub her hands on her lips. Eww!! We are hoping she was only a hostess and didn't touch any food.    Note: if you're looking for the game area, they are not at this location.  This location is in a great area for wandering and shopping though.

I need to start out by saying I RARELY eat what I consider "junk" fast food but my husband craves it. We are both in the midst of studying for big exams for our work and my husband wanted junk food to fuel him. We went through the drive through. The service was friendly but it's was very hard to hear the girl over the speaker. Occasionally a guy would talk and it seemed like his headset or whatever worked MUCH better. When we got home one item was missing from the bag. We called and they were pleasant but said we had to come into the store for refund or replacement but could come another day.   As far as the food - my husband said his crunch wrap was all lettuce with a tiny   bite of meat. His (much cheaper) tacos had far more meat.   When I went back a few days later for the refund on the nacho bell grande they were pleasant but only offered to replace the item. I probably could've raised a stink but it's not worth the grief.   The nachos were "ok" but I wouldn't order them again. We miss the Taco Bell of days past when the meat didn't seem like it was more fluff than protein and the nacho cheese wasn't mildly spiced yellow goo. Eh, but that's why we stopped coming here, we'd rather eat actual food than "food like products".  Oh and if you want Long John Silvers, much better deal to go to their other store. Here the coleslaw is pre-packaged and much smaller than you would get at a solely LJS location.

Wendy in the Michael Kors dept was excellent. Very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The lady in Lancôme was also friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Unfortunately the Mac counter was ho hum. They helped me but seemed very disinterested borderline annoyed. If there was another Mac counter nearby I would've shopped there instead.   The store is clean and organized.

While the while process and cost of buying new cell service, phone etc is generally awful everywhere, the person who helped me was awesome.   First- what I was looking for was to solve a unique issue. Kevin answered numerous calls, questions etched as I tried to find the right product for my needs. He suggested ways to get an inexpensive phone, reduce my monthly bills etc.   Once a decision had been made, he spent literally hours (long story) transferring numbers, opening service etc. He was professional, pleasant and funny. Other employees also were involved to solve my weird situation and they were equally helpful and fun. Kevin gets 5+ for his service. The 4 star is for verizon and all cell companies who do not make the processes or prices easy.

Very pleasantly surprised by this place. The office was clean, staff friendly. It wasn't a place overflowing with animals in the waiting room (which would scare my cat).

Quaint environment and great for vegans and vegetarians. Prices are steep but quality is good too. I ordered a breakfast plate from their board (no price listed) and a pomegranate tea - was surprised at a $22 bill.   Now, I'm not vegetarian so my perspective comes from a "likes to be healthy" meat eater. Eggs were good. Veggie bacon wasn't for me because I really like the real stuff but I think vegetarians would love it. Pancake special was tasty with fruit, sprinkle of chocolate  and nuts in it. Pomegranate tea was only okay and apparently cost $4-$5. Service was minor - very little interaction with those of us sitting at the bar. Decor was cute.   Overall - I'm glad it's here for all my vegan/vegetarian friends but would only come back with them. The price was just too high for my simple breakfast needs.

We loved it so much the first time that we had to come back for more. Eggplant is excellent. Ravioli with tomato cream sauce was to die for! Bread is excellent. Service was excellent.   On trip #2 my husband wasn't impressed with the pizza crust. I had the chicken piccata. It was good but not amazing. Server this time was ... Forgetful but pleasant    Love their bread and salad that comes with the meals but would appreciate if they checked before delivering it whether we want all the ingredients in it. One person didn't eat onions, another didn't eat pork so we had to send it back both times. Felt bad wasting good food, and it caused our food and salad to come out simultaneously.

Stopped by after an appointment in the Northern part of Phoenix. When I first walked in I wasn't sure if it was take out only or more of a butcher place. After reading the sign and peering around the corner to see seating is in back, I decided to order.   The young man serving was very friendly. He suggested the combo so I could try several different items. He also recommended the baked beans and Mac n cheese. His recommendation was spot on. I'm not a huge Mac n cheese fan, but loved theirs - good cheese flavor. Beans were good too.   The combo comes with pork, sausage and chicken. Enjoyed all of them and was thrilled they had watermelon tea. It's rare to find but I love it. There's not a lot of ambiance but the people are friendly and the food is tasty.

We called to schedule an appointment. After explaining our problem he told us how we can fix it ourselves. Saved us money vs having him come out and do it. Pretty cool!

The food was almost tasteless. I had the roast beef with horseradish sauce but there was zero spice. I added salt to try to give it flavor to no avail. The house made chips literally tasted like almost crispy cardboard. My niece had a burger with chipotle sauce. She too said zero flavor. We asked for more sauce for hers and it still tasted bland. Service was a little slow. I wouldn't go back.

Last year ADT told us we moved into the most dangerous city in the nation. I said "Really?! More than Chicago, Detroit  or DC? Would you like to wait while I pull up the stats on that?" They didn't have time to wait. Tsk tsk.   Today they told a client of mine (I'm a Realtor) that their agent (me) should have told them I made an appointment for them to show up today and I should've told them. (I did not and would not). I'm such to death of lying sales people.   I will, going forward, forewarn every client of their lying sales tactics. Do NOT trust them or use them.

The food is always fresh and more importantly, it's unique. I love that there's a place my "no fish" husband and his "fish loving" wife can both enjoy fresh tasty Mexican food for a reasonable price.

For cheap pizza, it is fine but only if you're looking for cheap. They said 40 minutes for pick up. Arrived early (approx 20 min) and it was already done. Needless to say, it was cold.

Burger: good soft bun, meat was cooked as requested. Burger was 7/10. It was seasoned well but was a preformed, probably frozen patty.   Fries: coated shoe string fries 6/10  Pretzel: We didn't prefer either sauce. Pretzel itself was meh. 4/10  Mac n Cheese: cavatappi noodles with homemade rich, milky cheese sauce. 9/10  Fish n Chips: 3 thick moist portions of white flaky fish with light coating. Excellent tartar. 8/10  Accompanying salad: quality greens with excellent blue cheese dressing. 8/10  Cole slaw: midway between dry and creamy. Very slight fruity flavor. 7/10  Iced tea: Fresh and tasty (important for me since I rarely drink anything other than water or tea). 9/10  Service: Very good,friendly and helpful   Ambiance: laid back, friendly and very "Cheers"-esque.   Will we be back? Most likely, especially for Seahawks football since they play all football games!

Jim was great! His pricing was fair, communication excellent, he kept everything tidy and as clean as possible. He was polite and even friendly to my cats. We will absolutely use him again.  Part 2: We have continued to use Jim and he's awesome! I love his honesty. Can't recommend him highly enough.

Fabulous! I took my mom here for a treat for her and because my feet were killing me after two weeks of packing and unpacking into my new home.  Sooo wonderful! It's a full body massage for $30 with quality time spent on the feet.  Only $30! I want to do the $55 two hour next time.  My feet and body feel so much better, and my mom said hers really felt  wonderful too. The cold bottle of water was a nice finish to the massage.   We had to change our appointment time and were still a few minutes late but they accommodated us without attitude. She did call to make sure we knew where it was located, which was very polite because some have driven by it on accident.   Don't forget your punch card to earn a free one!

We used to love this restaurant but it's just not what it used to be.  The mizithra cheese was good but not "crave worthy" like it used to be. The chicken Parmesan tasted weird...like the chicken may have been freezer burned? Salad was good but again, nothing unique or special. Service was friendly but slow, with drinks only being filled after they were empty. We did bring home our leftovers but I told my husband he can have them. My guess is they'll be thrown out. They're just not worth the calories.

Based on another review, I tried the machaca chimichanga. I tried half green and half red sauce. I'd recommend the green, very tasty! My husband enjoyed the quesadilla but didn't prefer the taste of the #10. All the ingredients were quality and the service was friendly. We will be back.

Oh where to begin? The food was OK, average, forgettable. We had 3 different servers by the time we ordered. Maybe the guy was new but the food took forever to arrive. We had one refill of drinks, weren't checked on and had to flag him down for the multiple missing and/incorrect items ordered. He was pleasant but that's about all I can say. We asked if there were substitutes for fries, and thus ordered the tater tots, after confirming there wasn't anything on them. Then they come out loaded with cheese, sour cream, bacon and onions. None of which we wanted. To top it off, we were charged $2 extra and weren't told there was an extra charge. The bill was wrong on top of that charge so we didn't dispute the $2 but it was reflected in the tip.    My husbands burger was meh. The lettuce was literally one very thin piece of square lettuce. Seriously?!? Even fast food places give you lettuce!  The cherry on top of this dinner was we were seated in the central Hub,where you can watch all the servers congregate, talk, sometimes bicker and clearly not serve their customers.   In summary - we came because of a free birthday meal - Decided to give them another try even though we didn't remember loving the food. I'll unsubscribe from any further offers. I don't ever want to be tempted to come here again.    I can't believe we paid for all the empty calories of bland food we just consumed.

Absolutely amazing! I tend to get very tense during photos and really hate having them taken but Jacqueline was able to get me to relax, smile and even laugh enough to get some amazing shots. Only problem - I'm sure I don't look that good!   I've already had friends request her info after they saw the quality and professionalism of my photos. We will use her again without hesitation.

Great massages but I'm not big on the "up-selling" of a "detox" with your foot massage. I think it's a gimmick but what ev. The massages are meant to work out kinks so be prepared! I always walk out feeling better than I walked in.

The Tuna was fresh and tasty. Pleasantly surprised for a fast food place. The burgers had a nice charbroiled flavor. French fries were good too. I love the various options for iced tea including green and passion fruit flavored. Service was friendly and food was delivered quickly so it was still nice and warm. No complaints about any of it. We will be back!

The Alfredo the dark with chicken was DELISH!!! The bread that comes with it had a funky flavor. My husband ordered the margarita pizza. It was tasty but very traditional (meaning very little cheese) so my husband was a bit disappointed. Environment and service was upbeat. We will try it again. (Looking forward to enjoying my leftovers for at least 2 if not 3 more meals) Yum!

Darling spot! Family run fun spot that's been around a LONG time! It's run by (or at least partially) Fran's daughter in law. Food is literally homemade. We overheard them discussing freshly made pies and bread pudding, fresh from the oven. Cool!  My split pea soup wasn't as thick as I usually have it but the taste was great  it was paired with 1/2 ham sandwich which was an old school tasty throwback served with a side of chips.   My husband, the burger meister, got big happy eyes after his first bite. The meat was fresh, juicy and an awesome squishy white bun. The patties are hand formed deliciousness. The fries are coated and are an add on, otherwise it comes with Lays style potato chips. His root beer float was old fashioned, made with two scoops of great ice cream, quality root beer and free with the burger and fries.   We both left stuffed, charmed and charmed by our waitress.

The best bagel we've had in the Phoenix area. Bagels are large yet airy and flavorful. Being an ice tea lover, I'm thrilled that they have a fresh fruity tea. They have stevia too which is a plus. We haven't had their sandwiches but have heard they're delish.

We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The burger was excellent as was the coleslaw. They also offered a spicy cornbread appetizer since it was our first visit. If they were closer, we would come here more often.  Definitely worth a visit!

Here's the thing you need to know - if you come for sandwiches and salad, they're good and you'll enjoy them but this is not what you come to Postiono's for.   You come here for amazing bruschetta platters, awesome wine and mimosas for $5 (or a pitcher of beer but I'm not a beer girl) before 5pm during the week. You come for cheese boards and butcher blocks. You come with a friend and enjoy great service outside in the sun. It's not a meal, but a place to gather with your friends and enjoy an afternoon together. This. This is why we love Postino's

We went here because we had a coupon and it was close to where we live. Long and short- the coupon doesn't make the poor service and poorly cleaned clothes worth it. Also my husbands pants were pressed wrong. We have since found Lapels and LOVE them! FYI - lapels has pick up and delivery from your home PLUS good prices.

Best. Meal. EVER! I didn't know food could taste this amazing. We had the Hells Kitchen tasting. Expensive but worth it! Everything was wonderful but special Kudos for the dessert (sticky toffee pudding and ice cream that we lovingly refer to as butter ice cream). I've never been a fan of beef Wellington and was dubious to say the least. It was AMAZING! The meat practically melts in your mouth. Honestly, we dine out a lot, I didn't know food could taste this good. It's flat out awesome.

We arrived a couple minutes before 6pm to the happy surprise that Happy Hour went until 7pm. I enjoyed very tasty carne asada tacos for the HH price of $5. My friend had a turkey club sandwich. It was huge and served on a pretzel bun. While tasty, it was so big it was hard to eat. The cocktails were good (margarita, blood orange margarita and...something we no longer remember the name of). Our service was very good. Christian was wonderful plus two others would stop by to check on us. We enjoyed the pub ambiance and were pleasantly surprised to learn everything (including pasta) is made in the kitchen. We will definitely be back!

We recently returned after not having been here for some time. The owner was there and, as always, was so cheerful and charming.    We ordered cheese bread for an appetizer, which was very tasty.  We also had two small pizzas with light sauce - one cheese and one with extra pepperoni which was truly extra, so  maybe the last time was just a fluke?  Both pizzas had the light sauce we requested, good crust and flavorful toppings.  We left with plenty of leftovers for another meal.  They have pretty good specials, like a small pizza with drink for $6.99 which is a great deal.

I've been here 3 times. Their prices are quite a but lower because students are doing the work. So far 2 of my services were fantastic while the 3rd one was okay. If you find an esthetician you like, you can book your appts with that person. Definitely worth the price you pay!

The turkey sandwich was very fresh and excellent as was the tropical tea. I appreciated that the fruit side didn't have melons but apples, grapes and pineapple. The best part was great service from Xavier. As a semi-frequent traveler, his friendliness was wonderful. I'll be back! (The 4 instead of 5 was the pre-formed burger patty on my husbands burger).

Very fun spot! It's a combo diner, malt shop and antique store. Friendly service, great atmosphere and lots of unique drinks and desserts. My husband loved the Elvis Presley shake. Rumor us you can ask for a maple bacon shake too. Definitely worth stopping by for a taste of an earlier simpler time.

This place was not what we expected. It's not a BBQ joint but a hipster chichi restaurant. We were informed by our waiter that the chef cooks what he wants, how he wants and does not customize orders. This was in response to asking if there were any other salad dressing options other than shallot vinaigrette.  In other words, no, there are no other options. The pork burger is also filled with ground onions. Being a true onion hater, this was disappointing.   We both ended up sharing the Brussel sprout starter and each had a burger. I enjoyed the Brussels sprouts but my husband found them too dry. The unusual addition of egg on top helped with the dryness.   Both of our burgers came out overcooked to well done. The outside is a very crunchy charbroil. There wasn't much flavor but the quality of the meat was high. The burger as well as the meat were both dry and disappointing. My husband did not enjoy his shallot vinaigrette dressed salad, finding it too bitter for his preference. I had the fries which are cooked in vinegar. This added a nice flavor to them.   Unfortunately the menu was too limited for us. We recognized the quality of the food but the flavors just weren't there. Service was adequate, nothing more.

Fun spot! We chose to sit by the kitchen to watch them in action. The service was excellent. Farm burger was very tasty. Who knew there was duck bacon?! We also had the basic fries. They were good but nothing is crave. Served with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. I preferred the curry although it was a very strong flavor that can over power the meal IMO. We also had the chanterelle mushroom burger. The onion jam overpowered the mushrooms. It was ok but I wouldn't order it again. We finished with the highly acclaimed creme brûlée pudding Oreo cookie shake. I'm now a big fan of creme brûlée pudding. Yumm! We will be back to try more options in the future.

I would give it a 3, my husband a 5 so we are compromising with a 4. The meat was tender but not particularly flavorful to me. The various sauces were interesting to try but only one of them appealed to me (3 for my husband). Service was basic, the place was crowded but it was cleaned as quickly as possible with the crowds. I wouldn't go out of my way for it but my husband would.

We enjoyed our meal here. The bicycle themed restaurant was fun, the waitress was very friendly and accommodating. The outside is lovely with a patio for dining, a pond with ducks and misters to keep you cool. The downside was that there was a smoker on the patio so we went back inside.   My husband enjoyed his burger with the exception of the spicy aioli. He said it overwhelmed the flavor. My salad and turkey with roasted peppers on ciabatta was very flavorful. Luckily I had asked for the aioli on the side so it didn't mess with the other flavors. They made some guac especially for us so that we could have it onion free. If it was closer we would definitely be back regularly.

Pork belly toast with sriracha sauce and cucumber was excellent. Expected not to like the smashed Irishman drink since I don't like beer or whiskey but it was really good, without the harsh bite I expected. Service was good but not great. Nothing horrible or exceptional.  I'd come back.

Great food. My husband gave the steak tips 5/5, my mom gave the sweet potato fries 5/5, I switched the green chili burger with a chicken breast and would give it 5/5. We also ordered fried pickle chips that were a family favorite. Michelle, our server, was friendly and prompt.   The 4/5 because we've realized it's hit and miss depending in what you order. The buffalo chicken in the salad was thin and leathery.  Some of the apps are too heavy. We go for the items we know we like but I've  learned it's a waste to venture beyond these items.

Sad to say that this was probably our last visit. They've changed the recipe for several items and the food was very disappointing. We used to love the pickle chips but now they're bland and not worthy of ordering again. My husband loved the beef skewers but they were so bad he didn't finish them. The salad was made with old lettuce and the BBQ beef was dry and tasteless.   To top it off, the waitress was pleasant but far from concerned about our food coming on time, whether the food was prepared correctly and how to answer questions about the menu.   To top it off, they sent the hostess home early (8 pm) and I had to go find someone to see if we should seat ourselves.   The only positive change was the Mac n cheese. It used to be made with fake velveeta cheese but now has real cheddar.   If this restaurant stays open with the new preparation of the food and dismal service. I would be shocked.

The place was packed on a Saturday but the wait wasn't too bad. My husband ordered French toast without powdered sugar. It came out wrong but they made him a new one fairly quickly. I had a waffle and bacon. Both were good, but mine was better ;-) Super yummy and hit the spot! I informed the server that I drink LOTS of water and he brought out a pitcher (and kept refilling it for me!) Our server didn't have much personality but he was efficient so I have no complaints there.   My recommendation to the owners- have the servers take the checks so you pay at the table. The combination of people waiting to pay and people waiting to get in gets quite overwhelming. I think it also discourages business because people walking up see this mass of humanity and think their wait will be too long. Actuality is that at least 1/3 of them are simply waiting to pay.

We really like this spot. I LOVE their chicken Caesar salad, my husband loves their chicken fried streak. We tried sour cream lemon pie once and it was delish!! Service is friendly. Some servers seem timid. The (I think) son of the owner or manager runs the Sunday brunch and is very personable. The interior seems little dated but Im guessing some of the senior crowd likes it, my mom probably would. If we are in the area, it's a good lunch spot.

Q4oSd6X1Ca6CuW4jj99-4w
I'm very torn writing this review as I had anticipated giving a much higher rating. I dropped off some items to sell a month or so ago. The gentleman was polite and efficient. Some of the items have sold and I enjoyed the option of using a credit and/or cash for what sold. I used most of my credit at My Sisters Attic for some adorable shoes then received cash for the remaining amount.   When I brought my items in, I remembered that if we wanted items back that hadn't sold then we had to pick them up within a specific amount of time. Over the next few weeks I'll be traveling and unable to stop in so I called the store.   This is where my review score plummets. I asked about how I could go about finding out what hadn't sold. Connie, as I later learned her name, was very abrupt and told me I needed to check online. I responded (or tried to before she VERY RUDELY cut me off) that my understanding was that you can only check your account balance online, but not what has or has not sold. I never had the opportunity to finish my sentence before Connie became so condescending I was flabbergasted.   In a harsh voice (and a tone indicating she just stepped into a pile of poo) Connie cut me off and told me I had to check online plus some other demeaning words that let me know I was beneath her.  Apparently so beneath her that extending common courtesy as a human being, let alone a customer, was not worth her time or breath. I was so taken aback that I went from polite to shocked to deeply offended by the time her valuable breath had been used up.  In a tone to let her know how offended I was, I asked for her name, her bosses name (Paul) and informed her that had she taken the time to LISTEN that she would have learned that what I was going to ask is 'it is my understanding is that I can only check balances online but could not find out what items hadn't sold, was that correct?'  Connie, back peddling  and trying to be professional, said I was correct and began to make excuses for her behavior.   One was that she couldn't hear me very well. Really?!? A poor connection means you should treat someone poorly!? How about saying "I'm sorry, we have a poor connection" in which case I would have apologized and called back.     There simply was no excuse for her behavior and to presume there was only offended me more.    I then said she had many options of how to respond, such as to have politely said "I apologize for any inconvenience but you would need to stop by our store to get an inventory of the items that are remaining." I would have said "Thank you" and stopped by later in the week.   Her others excuse was (insert condescending 'you're an imposter' voice here) How could she POSSIBLY know the person on the phone was the REAL owner of these items brought in!?!' Umm...how about ask my name, phone number, address or email? There's plenty of ways to confirm my identity. Ironically, in the store no one asked for any form of ID before telling me what had or hadn't sold, just my name. Weirdness.   Instead she successfully offended me as both a buyer and seller for her company.  Most likely she successfully lost future business and/or referrals from me. (I've brought friends and family in to shop as well, even suggesting my mom bring her artwork in that she has been storing since moving to her new home).   So now I'm left trying to decide if this was a one off incident or not. Recently I was in My Sisters Attic and heard them talking about how they need evening gowns around homecoming, prom etc.  I have many designer gowns that would be perfect that I was planning on bringing in. Do I bring them in and chance being treated like pond scum again? Do I stop in to see what is left from items previously brought in and chance being treated like a vagrant? Or simply walk away never to darken their doorsteps again.

Good food, good service. One of my husbands favorite burger spots. I appreciate they have hot dogs that I can get lots of veggies on. I liked the mix n match drink options. Raspberry seltzer water was a nice option. The fries...I just don't understand why people like these. WAY too greasy. My husband would give them a five star if the buns were heated. To resolve this, he keeps it wrapped up for a minute or two after it's been served so the burger heats Nd softens a little.

Last year ADT told us we moved into the most dangerous city in the nation. I said "Really?! More than Chicago, Detroit  or DC? Would you like to wait while I pull up the stats on that?" They didn't have time to wait. Tsk tsk.   Today they told a client of mine (I'm a Realtor) that their agent (me) should have told them I made an appointment for them to show up today and I should've told them. (I did not and would not). I'm such to death of lying sales people.   I will, going forward, forewarn every client of their lying sales tactics. Do NOT trust them or use them.

We thought the food had very good  flavor. Ingredients were quality and service was good. Worth a try if you haven't been here.

First off, you need to know that Friday and Saturday nights are busy so you need to be prepared for a wait. Also, the environment on these nights is festive and loud. Personally I don't think it's a good place for group events.   The quality of the food was high. The carne asada, salsas, house made tortillas etc. were all very tasty.   We were both impressed that when an error was made and someone took a special ordered item to the wrong table, thus causing a meal to be deliver late, they were obviously very concerned. We had 3 people come to the table to apologize and the manager (I believe) came by to tell us that they'd taken that item off our Bill (without us complaining or asking for it). That obvious concern and care for patrons goes a long way.   The food alone is worth coming here for. The obvious pride of ownership and care for customers makes them even more impressive.

Ditto to previous reviewers. We ordered through CostCo. Delivery the first time was fine, although he tried to get us to up our water order.   Since then, every single order is wrong and my bill reflects the extra bottles dropped off that we did not order.  When we call to have them correct the order and pick up the extra bottles, between wait times on hold and having to escalate the issue because the normal call center people can't help us, it sucks up and hour of my life.   Currently I am staring at a bottle that was guaranteed to be picked up by yesterday. Today I've spent 45 minutes on the phone only for them to tell me they can't pick it up for two weeks. That's unacceptable to me so have to escalate it again. I'm currently awaiting a call back.   I highly recommend buying a dispenser at Walmart and filling bottles at Winco. Even if you buy a new dispenser every year, it would cost less. Technically it's more work but not when you add in the frustration level and time to correct bills and orders.

The service was friendly. I figured out a way to order a salad I like without being (over)charged for items I take off of it.  The food was fresh, salad was excellent, they have several iced tea choices (which I love) and they always give a free cookie. Who can complain?   Hint-instead of an Apple Fuji salad minus chicken and onions, I got the crumbly blue and switched the dressing. I missed the apple chips but it was worth not paying $1+ more for a half salad.

I'm giving it a 2 instead of a one because I love the concept. Natural drinks, stevia for iced tea, home made buns and freshly ground meat. Sounds PERFECT... Until you bite into the burger and it's so heavily seasoned you can't begin to taste the meat.   Our server only showed up once at the end. We asked if it's possible to get an unseasoned patty and the answer was a grimace with a "no, they mix it in the morning and that's the only way it comes". Grimaced indeed. If we wanted sausage we would've gone someplace that sells sausage. Neither of us finished our burger. Sadly, we won't be back.

Stopped in because of a free taco coupon. Very glad I did. Ambiance was updated casual. A step up from typical fast food. The cashier was friendly and personable. I ordered a chicken and steak taco without onions. The order came out with just cilantro, as requested. There were 3 salsas to choose from. Nice to have the variety as one I preferred with chicken and the other 2 were both tasty with the carne asada. I'm a huge iced tea fan. They had a very fresh tasty fruit flavored tea. I'll come back with my husband. I think he'll really like it too.

I'm not a huge donut person but we had an early morning airport run and Chick Fil A was closed for the holiday.  The donuts were pretty good. They were very soft and moist. My husband said the glaze/icing ratio to donut was perfect. I had a warmed ham, cheese and jalapeño croissant. It was moist, flakey and had good flavor. Thumbs up iced tea that is brewed rather than concentrate. If we were looking for donuts, this is the place we would go.

We've been here several times and often find what we are looking for. Good prices and a huge selection. Service is friendly. They're busy so you may have to find assistance on occasion. Check out is slow. You may need some patience due to how busy they are but it's usually worth it.  We did have a problem with delivery but they resolved it without any hassles. The issues were: the salesperson said delivery included set up of the big umbrella we purchased. The delivery person said they don't do that. Also we received a call saying delivery would be 12:30-1pm. I went to a morning gym class and had a message we were the next delivery when the class ended. They arrived before I did (10:20 ish) so my husband had to excuse himself from work (he works from home) to take the delivery. The delivery people were very polite in explaining the salesperson shouldn't have told us they would set up the umbrella (it takes 200lbs of sand which was in my car). They said they would do it of the sand was there but couldn't wait for me to arrive. Sadly I was already in the neighborhood when they drove away, but it was too late. A few minutes later I received a call from their service dept inquiring about our delivery. I was pleased they called me so I didn't have to hunt down who to talk to.  Long story short, we were given a credit the delivery costs. I was pleased with how professional everyone was in swiftly handling the issue.

The loose meat sandwich comes on a hot dog bun with really good flavor. The burger was Delicious and juicy! Get it with bacon and cheese for a real treat. Onion rings were a hit too, my husband says they're "to die for". Service was awesome! Both Cristy and the owner were informative and friendly.  The rock n rye FayGo was delish too. A big extra big star because they not only had iced tea (I don't drink soda), but it was very fresh. This is hard to find in many mom n pop type restaurants. Who am I kidding, it's hard to find in big restaurants too. The quality is much appreciated by this tea toddler.   Now we wait in the hope they open one in the SE side of Gilbert ...although the gym might need to become even more frequent if they do!

Love this place. The ordering process is a little odd but once you get used to it, it's not bad. Sometimes there's a backup waiting to get a pin and bag to mark your orders. You can order your sandwich "skinny" (less bread) or as a salad. I normally don't like chips but I do like their house made salt and pepper chips.   Ingredients are fresh and you can have them make it with exactly the ingredients you want in it. One star down because there's a couple items that typically come with onion. I write in big letters NO ONION and tell the cashier. They only see it about 1/2 the time. Very frustrating when ordering to go and don't see until I don't see it until I get home. Also because typically chicken is my favorite meat. Theirs is Ho-hum. Not sure why but it seems to lack flavor.

Aziza is very knowledgable and so talented. My hair is healthier and growing longer because of the products she's uses. She lightens it without bleach. Wonderful!   She's also very friendly and genuine. I enjoy my time with her. Can't recommend her highly enough!

We were really impressed with this location. I rarely expect service at a Goodwill but everyone was very friendly. They have a larger selection than most stores plus it was very organized and clean. We went for Halloween items. They had a great selection of new and old costumes, masks, decorations etc. We were very pleased!

We tried it for the first time and liked it so much we went back the next day. They offer several cheeses including fresh mozzarella as toppings. The tomato sauce is fresh and with a slight sweet flavor. We love the garlic and oil sauce, I enjoyed the buffalo sauce but thought Alfredo was very 'meh'. The crust is a thin 'cracker' crust cooked to perfection.  They have a gluten free option too!  It all comes together in an incredible pizza experience.   You can choose a nice variety of sauces, cheeses and meats. If you're not into pizza, there's wonderful salad options too. Being an avid water and iced tea drinker, I was personally pleased with 4 delicious tea options.   We have previous been to Mod pizza and Sauce. It beats Mod hands down and is even better than Sauce. They each have similarities but when it comes to flavor, this place is the clear winner.

Very pleasantly surprised. Jessica was very knowledgeable. She gave us lots of tips of how to improve our tax basis. We will continue using her services and happily refer her out. She's SO much better than the accountant we've used for the past decade!!!

My husband is a very picky burger guy and he gave it a thumbs up. It was fresh and  more filling than he anticipated. He ordered two patties and said it was too much...next time only one patty. The onion rings were crazy good and fries "average" good. Sadly we were so full from the burgers we didn't finish either of them. I had the brisket burger. All I can say is "oh my!"  Next time I would change the cheese away from blu as it over powered the tasty meat IMO. I would also share it!  Good stuff.

We arrived on a Saturday night at 8:45. The sign on the door said they closed at 10 pm. We were surprised to find they were already shutting down the restaurant. We ordered 2 drinks with our meals only to find that they had already put away the iced tea and fruit juice dispensers. I only drink iced tea or still water and had to go next store to get something to drink with my meal. Had I known this earlier, we would have left and eaten elsewhere. We also noticed that half the tables has been cleared of the napkin dispensers. All of this an hour and 15 minutes before closing, making the customer feel like they are an intrusion. No apology was given when I asked about the tea and subsequently requested a refund.   Our last rating was a 5/5. We still love the food but this kind of service is unacceptable. We will not drive out of our way as we often do to come here, if we cannot be ensured that the items we want to order are available and we are made to feel like an inconvenience.

The quality and taste of the food was excellent. We had fajitas and carne asada. Both were fantastic. Only unfortunate part was it was a cold night and the restaurant felt cold because we were sitting near the glass wall. Be prepared, it's expensive but VERY good!

When we ordered our meals my husband told them he doesn't like seasoned meat burgers. When it came out it was so heavily seasoned it tasted like an overly seasoned meatloaf. Completely inedible for us. The waiter then said that the cooks told him as he was taking the food out that the seasoning is so minor is cooks off. Uhh no! I don't mind seasoned meat and it was too much for me too. While friendly and apologetic, there wasn't an offer to take it off the check or try another meal. Very disappointing experience.   My BBQ chicken flat bread was fine. Nothing unique or special. Good size if you're not a big eater. Seasoned/coated fries with burger weren't bad. FYI- It's a loud sports bar atmosphere. We enjoyed sitting outside with TV as background noise while playing trivia. Sadly, we probably won't be back. Had they offered a substitution or removing it from the check, we would give it another try but my bbq flat bread wasn't worth $20.

I'm addicted to the Mahi Mahi with hummus. The only problem is that I always ask for it without pico on top and they ALWAYS put pico on it. Literally every time.   My husband really enjoyed their vegetarian burger. I also like both their green and black teas. Service is friendly but not always prompt n  We do wish it wasn't quite so loud so we could hear each other more clearly.

Other than not being able to pay with our credit card, we are surprisingly pleased with our shipping here. The fruits and veggies have been very fresh and flavorful. I enjoy the bulk section as it's less expensive and I can buy in the quantity I need. Self bagging at checkout but cashiers have been friendly.

I'm not sure where to go with this review as it was one of the strangest dining experiences ever.  My husband ordered 2 appetizers and I ordered one. Not being a beer drinker, I was disappointed that iced tea isn't an option. I was stuck with water since I no longer drink sodas either.   Our pretzel with beer cheese arrived. The pretzel was huge. It was salted without being overdone. There was a honey mustard sauce and something that looked like thousand island. It tasted like a sausage mayo or something. When she came back we asked about the cheese. Apparently the weird pink stuff was cheese. I swear I couldn't taste the cheese at all. Weird!! Anyway, she offered to remove it from our bill which was really cool (the cheese was extra) and brought out two more mustards. So we munched on this a little then put it aside while we waited for our other items.   The place was getting pretty busy and another waitress would stop by from time to time to fill our drinks. After an hour from arrival we waived down our waitress. She had zero memory of us ordering anything else. Zero! She had never placed the order because she didn't remember we ordered them.  Needless to say, we asked for our bill. The waitress said that she was new and when things got busy she must have forgotten. I appreciated that she was honest, friendly and humble. She waived the bill completely. We really appreciated her attitude and that she didn't make excuses or try to spread blame. Because of this, we would probably try it again but it was a pretty strange experience. Two stars from me 1 for her honesty and humility and 1 for the pretzel sans cheese. Husband gives them a zero.

I'm ridiculously sore and feel bruised. I had trouble sleeping because I hurt so much. Ambiance is nice, price is good but... I feel like I paid to be tortured. Sadly, the "kink" I wanted worked out is still there, under my very sore skin.

I have to admit, I was dubious of all the rave reviews. We waited in line for maybe 20 minutes. Sadly, the man right in front of us took the last of the sliced brisket. Our group had a pork rib, sausage, pulled pork, the jalapeño cheddar grits, coleslaw, the LAST pecan pie and chopped brisket. All of it was great.   The brisket and pecan  pie we took home for my husband who wasn't with us. My husband didn't eat the sandwich until the next day but said it was still great. Now he definitely wants to taste it fresh.   I've never been a grits fan but decided to give it a try to see if this one was actually as good as the reviews said. I really enjoyed it, similar to mashed potatoes but slightly different texture. To be honest, I probably would still skip it so I could eat more meat. I also wouldn't get a sandwich again, not because it isn't good but because the meat is so good I don't want to fill up on the bread. My fav was the sausage and I'm super picky (usually disliking it), but this was really good.  They have 3 BBQ sauces: house, spicy and mustard. All were good but the house was fantastic.   To top it off, the owner not only serves (he was taking the initial order and chopping the meat) and passes out samples while chopping, then later came out to talk to his customer.   We will be back!

First time back in quite awhile. Stopped with my mom for a margarita and shared the car it's flatbread. While the margarita was decent but not anything special, the carnitas flatbread was delish!! We shared it and both left very satisfied with the food. I'd come back for that in a heartbeat.

The food was pretty good. Very fresh and flavorful. We both preferred the chicken breast over the sirloin.  The sirloin would get a 3.5, chicken breast 4.5, the rice basmati rice a 3.5, the condiments a 4.   The rating drops dramatically because of the service. They get a 1. It was flat out awful - to the point that my husband insisted on no tip (which we never do). We get far better service at Chick Fil A than we got here.   And FYI to all the lazy/cheap waiters, waitresses and business owners - if someone tells you they hate onions, they can taste when you've simply lifted the red onions off the lettuce on a salad. That wasn't their only misstep but amplified what already sucked. I wasn't happy that I had nasty onion taste in my mouth the rest of the night.   They'd do better to make this place an upscale fast food so we could refill our own drinks, get utensils, go to a counter for plates or return good prepared wrong (twice)  etc.

I very much enjoyed my steam pot and was pleased they would remove crawfish and add extra shrimp for me. The glass pear was a mild yet tasty accompaniment. Service was good. Ambiance was quiet, perfect for a late lunch after a long day.

Husband wanted a basic turkey sandwich. They don't have plain mayo so he had dirty (garlic) aioli instead on the crunch bread. He also asked for cold. Turns out bread is half cooked so that when they make the sandwiches hit it cooks the rest of the way. It took a bit longer but he thought the crunch bread was very good. Turkey was high quality.   I wanted to try the halal chicken on wheat but had trouble  find one that sounded good that wasn't sweet. I finally settled on the Elvis Keith(or something like that??). The chicken had a very good flavor and was obviously quality but didn't prefer the wasabi mayo flavor with it. I think I need to play around to figure out what works for me.   Downgrade also was they had not made any iced tea that day. It was ready by the time our meal was almost over but a bummer for someone who doesn't drink soda.   Upgrade is that Sunday's they have happy hour and you get free drinks and chips so at least I didn't pay for my drink. (You may need to ask for the happy hour special? It wasn't mentioned until I asked but maybe he would have?)  Worth trying again to see if I can find something spicy with the chicken that I like.

We ordered a cheese quesadilla. Just cheese, no meat, veggies etc and it cost $8.25. Seriously? Worse yet, it wasn't very big. I let my husband have most of it because it was so paltry with very little cheese. We also ordered chips n queso with two drinks for a total of $18.   Their system of ordering similar to Chipotles, going down the line where different people put various ingredients in for you. Multiple people try to take your order, no one seems to know what the other is doing and the cashier always seems confused.   We've been here a couple times since they opened. For me, the meat tastes very sweet and the process of ordering and paying is so convoluted that we've decided it's our last trip. We will go back to Chipotles who has this process down, has better customer service and it doesn't cost as much.

I was concerned after reading the reviews but all my concerns were abated. There was security, but there wasn't anything extreme about them. Drinks are priced at club prices. The venue was clean. I felt no anxiety about the area. Sound was good. Not a lot of decor but I was there for Voltaire, not the scenery. We'd come back.

We stopped in because my husband wanted to try the new place, even tho we weren't hungry (to see if it's worth a future drive). He had a little carne asada taco that was excellent.  He also ordered the cheese quesadilla which was typical. Served hot, fresh and crispy. The food is served with a red and green sauce that's fairly typical. Since it was our first time there, she have us complimentary chips and salsa. If you come here-order some salsa! It was very fresh and the flavor was just right. She sold us! We will be back to try other items and we will order the yummy fresh flavorful salsa!

Stopped in again since we were in the area. Carne asada burrito was good with a lot of carne asada. Meat was overcooked but not dry. Salsas were good with a nice range of mild to spicy   Carnitas tacos were flavorful but also tad dry, the green salsa made them perfect.   For the reviewers who complained about paying for chips and salsa, they charge $1 for a decent basket filled with tortillas and homemade salsa. Seriously....totally worth the money if you are desiring chips.   Only unfortunate item for me is, I only drink water and tea. They only have soda style raspberry tea, which is way too fake tasting for me. Luckily I had a bottle of water in the car.   The server was young and lacked much personality but she answered questions for us. My guess is that she's shy. Overall we would give it a 3.5 but rounded up to 4 since that's not an option.

We shared a chicken and filet mignon combo. The meat was very flavorful and tender. The rice was ample and the yogurt cucumber dip was a perfect compliment to the meal.   Usually when you order a kabob meal at a restaurant it automatically comes with yogurt dip, bread and a roasted tomato. Here each item is separate. I dislike that type of nickel and dime tactic. Otherwise, it was very good.   Ambiance is meh. Just a room with tables and chairs.

We really appreciate the option of a healthy drive through salad place. The salads are big enough that we usually get two meals out of one. The ingredients are diverse enough to get what you enjoy for a reasonable price. It would be nice if they had an indoor seating area for times when I'm not headed home, but you can't have everything, right?

After having a horrible, time consuming  and expensive experience with another company, we started calling around for bids to other companies. Mechanicool came out on Monday of a 3 day weekend, without an extra charge. He was not only professional and friendly, but offered us a FAR less expensive way to fix our problem. We also appreciated his professionalism. He didn't bash the other company but explained there's other options that will be equally as effective for far less money.  Their option not only worked but saved us somewhere between $800-$1300. They've definitely won our business!

This is the classic mom and pop burger joint. The burger was delicious and the fries were a perfect match. Fresh meat, freshly made from hand formed patty seasoned well with salt and pepper. This is my husbands new favorite local burger joint.   *Fries did not have skin on them as other posts mentioned.

I was torn on this place. I've been 3 times and thought they were good. I really like Bob because he gives great massages when he gives manicures or pedicures.   The problem is they make big deals out of little things that definitely give me the impression they don't care about their clients.   One example is they have a punch card for each visit, after 5 visits you get $10 off. Oddly enough, they won't let you combine cards but don't tell you that until they give you a new card. Last trip I started to pull out my punch card when they said "it's ok" and gave me another one. This trip they tried to hand me another one and I said "wait, I have 2 already". They let me combine today's with one card but only after pushing them to do so. I can't combine the third card because they would "have to throw it away". What? Each card had one stamp. The card isn't dented, scratched or bent so why would they have to throw it away? I pointed this out but they said its against the owners policy.   If the cost of a stupid business card is worth less than my business, why would I continue coming here?    Also they advertise a $15 mini mani/pedi. The price is for each, not combined. Ok fine. Then she proceeds to go on and on about not getting a massage with $15 pedi, only with the $30. Fine w/me since I was in a hurry and didn't have time for a massage. Her response was to get a little huffy because I didn't buy a $30 pedicure. Seriously? Then don't advertise something you don't want to sell.   Since the initial post, 3 nails broke off. They fixed them without a hassle but I don't want to keep coming back to have nails fixed.  To put the cream on this debacle sundae, while I'm getting my third nail fixed I hear her asking people to write 5 star reviews because of my review. Here's a crazy concept, how about giving such good service that people WANT, of their own accord, to write you a good review and not because you made them feel sorry for you.   I wont be back. Unfortunate, because I like Bob but I want to at least FEEL my patronage matters. Here, I don't.

Totally delish! High quality ingredients, fresh veggies, great service. What's not to love? Green chili fries are awesome although we suggest chipotle sauce on the side as its overwhelming. The chicken sandwich was amazing and the prickly pear margarita was good (but I would not crave it).

This was our first visit here. This review is for those who understand that it's all about the flavor and texture of the meat. Toppings are an after thought.   The meat is cooked med well unless requested otherwise. The medium well patty is tender and juicy even though the meat appears to be compressed into a preformed shape. The flavor is good but suffers slightly from what appears to be a lower fat beef. (The hyper health conscious wife thought it was the bomb diggity). The bun was soft and complemented the patty well. Toppings were fresh and tasty. On my personal burger scale this burger rates a respectable 4.25/5. The wife gives it a 4 from her one bite.   We had a side of cheese ale sauce and it was some of the best beer Cheese we've had in this area. Note- if you don't like bacon or onions, make sure to request it without as that's standard. They kindly gave is a fresh one as we don't eat either between the two of us. Sauce gets 4.5/5. They need to have pretzels to go with a beer cheese that's this good.   Fries and sweet potato fries were good but nothing to write about other than we were glad to be able to order half regular fries and half sweet potato.   The buffalo chicken sandwich was ordered not fried on gluten free bread. It comes preformed in a perfectly round shape. It had something else in it..,seasoning and bread crumbs maybe? Overall the meat had good flavor and texture. The bun was dry and crumbly. I took it off and ate just the meat and veggies.   Sauces- they have chipotle mayo, Thai chili ketchup, Apple cider mayo, marshmallow (super sweet probably meant for sweet potato fries), ketchup, mayo, mustard, honey mustard, BBQ, ranging Cajun and ranch. All depends on what flavor you're looking for. We tried them but only used ranch for the fries.   All in all, good food, good service, nice atmosphere with optional outdoor dining.

I enjoy the vibe, the games and that they seek locally sourced food (according to the waitress). Food is good. I enjoy that they offer unique blends of flavor a with both food items and drinks. The smashed Irishman drink was surprisingly tasty.

The watermelon margarita was off the hook! So good! Guacamole with pomegranate was surprisingly good too. Black bean are smokey, chips are fresh made and ceviche was fresh and flavorful.  On top of that, the service was great. I'll be back with friends.

After reading all the bad reviews, we were a tad worried but I've also heard great things about the Lo Lo's in Scottsdale. We have stopped by a few times since opening but the wait was so long we opted for one of the neighboring restaurants instead.   Last night we decided to give them a try. Apparently midweek is the time to go, we were seated almost immediately. Unlike many of the other reviews, the service was good and the food came out promptly. We did notice lots of (what we assume we're managers) walking around asking how things are going. Based on the reviews, I can understand why they would be following up. A little pointer though - smile and be friendly when you ask. They were SO SERIOUS without even a hint of a smile which dampened the mood a bit.   Now the food: the waffles were good with a definitive cinnamon taste. Not amazing but good and worth ordering if I was in a waffle mood. We both loved the fried green tomatoes. They had a lot of flavor and we didn't need the side of creamy sauce. There was a side of Mac n Cheese and some potatoes with a sauce (not sure of the name since I didn't order them). The Mac was very thick and cheesy. We liked it, especially with a little Lo Lo's sauce to give it a spicy kick. The potatoes were very good too.   I'm glad I asked the waitress about boneless vs bone-in chicken. The boneless has a more bland seasoning (makes sense to have less seasoning for children) where the bone-in is more flavorful. I had the chicken breast and enjoyed it. I would've eaten then whole pice but my husband kept sneaking bites so I finally gave him the other half.   Summation: definitely worth trying but might want to go on a slow night rather than the weekend until they find their flow and the crowds get smaller.  Final note: They do not, in any way, focus on healthy eating. It's fried, sauces and gravies food.  If you're looking for healthy options, go elsewhere.

The Burger Meister (husband) gives it a solid 4.5 vs 5 because the burger was a little dry. It was a large 1/3 lb. hand formed, fresh ground beef patty. The buns are grilled and ingredients fresh. So fresh that the pickles are more picked cucumber flavor than pickle flavor (I personally prefer regular pickles).   Crinkle cut fries were fine, starchy, no seasoning or skin on them, which is how the burger man likes them. I'm not a big fry person. If I eat them I prefer seasoning. The fry dip has a distinctive cayenne pepper flavor without being hot.   For me personally, it was okay. As mentioned before, it wasn't my pickle preference and I probably would've preferred ketchup and mustard vs their sauce. Also, their iced tea is very "meh". I don't drink soda or coffee, and water in AZ often tastes dirty so good tea is important to me. I had to put both stevia and a shot of lemonade to make it drinkable where I rarely use any flavor or a sweetener.   Note: while we didn't order a shake, I verified that they still make their chocolate shakes like Lobby's did- vanilla with Hershey's syrup, which we don't prefer because the syrup tastes fake (vs hot fudge or chocolate ice cream). My personal score is 2.5/5 overall

Enjoyable moderately upscale atmosphere with some Day of the Dead decor. The service was wonderful, informative and friendly. The guac was unique. With craisins in it but surprisingly sooooo good!  Carne asada, chicken, pork etc were flavorful. Our whole table left stuffed and satisfied with a few leftovers. Two of the small tacos were plenty since they're stuffed with meat. We will be back.

Sooooo GOOD! Mahi Maji tacos were flavorful with an abundance of tender meat and fresh veggies. The mango salsa was perfect. My friend loved her Tilapia tacos and calamari fries. Sauces and salsas were all very tasty. We came in close to closing but the waiter was still friendly and helpful. I'll definitely be back!

Pomo is a moderately upscale restaurant. The quality of the ingredients is high and service is professional (vs friendly). We enjoy sitting by the oven to watch them prepare and cook the pizzas.   Their food is more of a true Italian food/pizza and not in any way an "American" Italian/pizza joint. If that's what you're looking for, this is not the place for you.   When we are in the mood for more authentic, this is our go to Italian restaurant. Personally, I enjoy their eggplant Parmesan. It's not a large dish filled with noodles,thankfully, but the flavor and quality is very good.

The food was TO DIE FOR! My friend had breakfast pot pie and loved it. I had the pick 2 eggs Benedict. The salmon was amazing!! Barbacoa was really good but out shined by the salmon. Breakfast cocktails were also tasty. Service was good. No complaints at all. We both look forward to coming back.

Never having been here before, the menu was a little confusing. The waitress explained it and I chose the mixed bag with the trifecta mild. Apparently the mix changes daily. Mine had snow crab, cod, shrimp and a variety of veggies and one piece of pineapple. I point out the pineapple because the pineapple with the spices was wonderful! I wanted more!!!   My friend had dungeonous crab trifecta medium. Medium has a good kick. It too was awesome.    The way it's served is literally in a plastic bag with a bucket for your scraps. The eating style is very messy - thank goodness for the bib and nearby sink to wash up in. The food was delicious!!! Neither of us finished our meals but who doesn't love leftovers!?  Fun environment. Don't wear clothes you're afraid of getting dirty. My friend ended up with trifecta sauce on her white pants. Ruh roh!  Also - don't go if you're in a hurry. It's just not that kind of spot. Do write on the wall!

The throwback sign and interior are cute. They were pretty busy so sitting inside would've been noisy and not relaxing.  They tried to help everyone but were not big on smiling. With time I'm hopeful they'll be more efficient and warm. They weren't unfriendly, but maybe a tad overwhelmed?  My husband felt it was expensive and griped about it. A few bites in he said "This IS really good ice cream".   Tad confused about a sign saying they served a sandwich. Do they? Doesn't seem like a natural fit or that they're set up for it but...who knows?  If we were in the area and craving ice cream, we might come back. We might also choose to sit at one of the nearby restaurants and order a desert for a few dollars more.

After becoming a regular at Fired Pie, I was looking forward to trying another location with a similar style. Unfortunately, this is NOT Fired Pie.   First -One pizza we had the regular crust which was flavorless. Think frozen pizza. The other was a whole grain crust. I thought it was funny when the girl said it tastes just like regular crust. Umm...it shouldn't and it doesn't. Sadly, it didn't taste the same but was still not good.   Next - they put on WAY too much sauce, even as we were telling her LIGHT sauce. They don't have "fresh mozzarella" as an option here (which is soooo good!) I'm spoiled and want my fresh mozzarella I admit it.   Lastly - one piece of meat in each slice of pizza. One. Seriously??   We each ate a minimal amount. My husband threw his away. I couldn't just toss it after just one piece so I boxed the rest and took it home. Every time I looked at it in the 'fridge my stomach said "Nooo, you don't want to eat that!"  Eventually I tried one of the pieces of Canadian bacon then threw the rest away.   I see people really like this place but I've been spoiled. I simply can't enjoy a cheap pizza that tastes cheap, no matter how many toppings I can put on it.

We enjoy this theater company. Theaters are clean, comfortable chairs, good sound and nice size screens.

We ordered a few items a la carte so we could taste a few of the various menu items lauded in reviews.   They had a special that day that our waitress said was the best thing on the menu in her opinion. I'm a sucker for comments like this so I decided to try it: a hamburger with a fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese spread. I'm a huge breakfast fan so I have no idea why I decided to do this but... It was good. HUGE, not great, but good. So huge that we had a charity dinner to go to 6-7 hours later and I was still stuffed to the gills.   The burger was quality meat, a huge patty (bigger than I prefer), the pimento cheese was generously piled on and the fried green tomato was good. Not amazing, but good. For my side we chose coleslaw, which we really liked, so much so that my husband ate it all. It's the mayo, sweet, no onion type of coleslaw.   My husband ordered a side small pancake (still huge) and fried potatoes (note: other reviews refer to hashbrowns. They don't make hashbrowns but do make very thinly sliced fried potatoes). I thought the potatoes were super tasty too.   Now - the infamous pancake: it's massive, made with cinnamon and vanilla and served with homemade maple syrup. I only had a couple bites but thought it was great. My husband doesn't prefer cinnamon or vanilla so he wasn't impressed but he brought home the leftovers and ate them, obviously he still liked them.   Service was excellent, everyone there was friendly and jovial  We will be back and this time I'll order my preferred breakfast - something consisting of eggs, bacon and veggies. Curious to try their "homemade" sausage!  Sorry- no pix because we "dug in" to the food as soon as it arrived.

Our group had 5 people in it, plus another couple we didn't know. We were pleased that everyone was involved in solving the mystery of the Whimsical Library. We finished with less than 5 minutes to spare but we made it!  We enjoyed it enough that we are planning on going back (maybe tonight?) to try another room.

It was a super busy night but the food was fast. They served us quickly and had employees trying to keep up with the crowd.   The carnitas sandwich is sweet. Too sweet for me but I'm sure others would love it. The strawberry salad was also sweet but very good, as was the bread. Loved my husbands tortilla soup.   They were out of strawberries so we received Belgian chocolate dipped Oreos instead.  We will be back for more healthy dining with fun drink options!

There's a woman who only works here on Sunday that gives outstanding service. She informed us about food, made recommendations and was genuinely friendly.   The quality of the food was very good. The black pepper beef wasn't quite spicy enough for us but she offered us hot oil and hot mustard to bring the spice up to our level. The kung pao chicken was also very good. The zucchini had an odd flavor but I put it into my brown rice with hot mustard and it was delish.   We look forward to coming back on a Friday night to hear the performer and maybe even catch his Elvis impersonation.

My husband said his sodalicios was lacking flavor (I don't recall which one he chose) but the sugar cookie was the bomb-diggity. I tried a sample they were offering and had to agree...very soft and so tempting!

Bobby gave absolutely phenomenal service to us even though we arrived 20 minutes before the kitchen shut down.   We shared the artichoke appetizer, mini burgers, skirt steak tacos, creme brûlée and chocolate cake. We ordered far more than we intended because the food was so good, but did bring some for leftovers.   !The burgers and artichoke were both good but I don't know that we would order them again. The tacos...oh the tacos! The skirt steak was tender, moist and full of flavor. I could probably develop an addiction to these!  The creme brûlée was tasty with a citrus flavor. The dark chocolate cake with espresso and vanilla gelato was fantastic...this is coming from a girl that doesn't like coffee at all!  We look forward to coming back to try more great food and experience excellent service, although it'll be hard not get the tacos again.

My husband had the burger and I had a Chicago dog. My Chicago was very good, fresh with lots of flavor and the right amount of toppings. The hamburger is grilled and very flavorful, served on a warm bun. Definitely better than a typical burger at a burger joint. They don't have iced tea, if your not a soda drinker then you'll want to get a bottle of water.   Service was friendly and prompt. The decor was quaint and the restaurant clean. We wouldn't hesitate to come back.

The service was really pleasant and patient while we figured out what we wanted. I had the butter ice cream which is made with Bischoff cookies with one coconut oatmeal cookie and one chocolate chip cookie with Oreos on the outside. The cashiers recommended fruity pebbles on the outside. Since I was hesitant about that idea and had two free toppings for checking in on Yelp, she put those on the side for me.   My husband ordered the bosa donut filled with vanilla ice cream... I cried "boring" and he later agreed it was plain...and then stole my fruity pebbles!  Seriously- the fruity pebbles sounds weird but it was the bomb diggity!   Personal preference was for the chocolate chip cookie over the oatmeal coconut, but they were both good.   One of these is massive enough to feed 2 people. Two for two people was pure gluttony. We ended up bringing the donut and a cookie home. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a sweet fix!

A fun and filling time was had by all! The food, service (and company!) we're great! There were so many great dishes.   If I had to choose favorites, since I can honestly say there wasn't anything that I didn't enjoy, they would be: See no evil drink YUM!! Shrimp pepper salt Yellow vegetable Thai curry  Thank you Hailey, Inchin Bamboo Garden Managment and staff for everything you did to put together a great night. I will need to come back with my husband so he can try it too.
