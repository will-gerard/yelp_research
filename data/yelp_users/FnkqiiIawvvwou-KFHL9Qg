My husband and I have gone to the Phoenix locations for years, but every time we go to the Tempe location it's hit or miss. Today we ordered two burritos and two Carne Asada tacos on flour. The girl ringing us up seemed distracted with her phone. When she repeated our order she left off the tacos so we repeated ourselves. When the food was brought out she had the burritos mixed up and we had to bite into them to discover the switch. When our tacos came out they were on corn not flour. All of the tortillas were dry which we've experience at this location before. I had to go inside to try and get the tacos switched out for flour. The cashier said she didn't hear us say flour and that she would get another out to us. More than five minutes later the taco came out when we were done eating. Wouldn't have been a big deal except that there were only two other tables in the restaurant and they already had their food. I don't think one taco should take more than 5 minutes to make.   We'll go back because we typically like the food, but this was a bad experience.

I have been going here for years and have been seen by both Sarah Neumann and Heather and have always had impeccable care. All of the office staff is helpful and attentive and my visits have always been personalized. I love going here because they are efficient but my appointments never seem rushed. I live in Mesa and it takes me about 45 minutes to get to their office but it is worth the drive. If you are on the fence, you need to try Ahwatukee Skin and Laser, I can't say enough good things. Oh and they know what they are doing, I've been receiving treatment for acne and my yearly checkups from them and I wouldn't be going back if I didn't trust them.

We came here for brunch and it was packed! There was a line out the door and while the wait for food was about 25 minutes the cashier was pleasant and warned us in advance. We got the One and One which was a perfect tasting of espresso and macchiato and it, along with our toast came up rather quickly despite the warning. The butter toast with cultured cream and jam was my favorite, great flavor combinations, different and a refreshing change. Out of the entrees our favorite was the Andouille crepe, tons of flavor, savory and satisfying.   If you are looking for a locally owned spot with inspired dishes, you should check out Crepe Bar.

My husband and I went to SoCal for the first time and were greeted immediately and sat right away on the patio (at 5:30 on a Friday). We were approached right away and ordered the shrimp cocktail ($7). It came with 5 large shrimp on ice and was very fresh. The cocktail sauce had a tad too much horseradish for my taste but was still good. We weren't very hungry so we split the Mahi tacos (two for $7), but they were a pretty decent size, larger than street tacos. The fish was fresh and it came with a mango chutney, cotija cheese and some cabbage. They didn't over do the cabbage or toppings and the salsa that came on the side was delicious. Our server was prompt with the bill and we had an overall great experience. I hope they stay consistent and worthy of five stars!

We've been to Joe's twice now and both times had a great experience. The servers are attentive and do a good job of clearing plates in between courses. Our server this time (Clayton) explained that they have no heat lamps so food is brought out as it comes up. Their menu reminds me of tapas, and is plated and priced that way, so food coming out at different times is logical. It does take a little longer for plates to come out, but after sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen it makes sense; EVERYTHING is fresh and made on the wood fired grill (plus they play awesome classics like The Big Lebowski to entertain you while you wait.) We have tried a good variety of menu items at this point; mushrooms, skirt steak, short ribs, veggies, Shishito peppers, Notorious B.I.G., Tartine, Strawberries and Oranges. I got the peppers and the steak twice because I enjoyed them so much. Everything is seasoned well, I loved the Romesco on the veggie plate.   I think this spot caters mostly to industry people and to a late night crowd, which some people don't get, despite the name. It's frustrating when you get out of work late and the only food around is fast food. Joe's has great music, good food (which the price is fair for), and it's fun. Phoenix needs more places like this and honestly, I feel like the people who don't feel that way just don't understand it. I'm tired of just burgers and fries at bars, so thank you Joe's.
