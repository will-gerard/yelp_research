Dive bar. No windows. Pours booze the way it should be poured.   This is a no nonsense establishment with limited televisions, and a jukebox. I have been going there ever since i moved to the area.   Walk in, sit down, lay some cash on the bar and enjoy your beverage. 'Nuff said.

Drinks were good, but our food service was very lethargic. Our food took 46 minutes to arrive, and when it did my meal was under cooked. All this while the tables surrounding were served and cleared. Quill not bed back for food service until something changes. Maybe we jiffy caught the kitchen at a bad time and a server who just did not care to provide quality assistance to a stranded table.

Could not be a bigger fan of this little spot. Prices are great, food is fantastic, and the beer selection is pretty good too. Favorite thing: Check out the Pastrami & CHeddar Sliders on the appetizer menu. Practically their own entree and...wait for it....LESS than $2!  I go fairly often and ahve not been disappointed. You will not be either.

Very big fan of this restaurant. Always have people out the door when you are hankering for a meal to satisfy. The menu takes simple dishes and takes them to the next level. What got me hooked?? Read on...  Chorizo eggs benedict DD style. What this means is that they scrap the holandaze* and english muffin and replace it with it's awesome cousin from 'Merica, biscuit and saussage gravy. I dont know about you, but when i think chorizo, i often think, "hmmm, why is this not covered in gravy and more saussage?"  Full bar, great menu and location. Winner.

Good beer, good food. Love the cashew butter and jelly sandwich with bananas!

I do not know who exactly to hold responsible for running a wood chipper at 5am on a Wednesday, but when i look out my window and see the name Tree Doctors North plastered on the side of the machine waking the entire complex up at that hour, I can not believe that there is a board member who would give clearance for this activity to begin at that hour.  Perhaps they do great work, perhaps it is the best. All i know is that as far as community respect and professional awareness...they did not come through on this occasion.

I was taken here by my wonderful girlfriend for my birthday celebration and cocktails not too long ago. Our server was fantastic, the food delightful and our server was terrific.  The selection is all done very well as are the cocktails and wine selection. The fact that they have a late night bistro menu is always a big plus to me as I enjoy a little finer dining and eating on my weekend evenings as opposed to swilling back metric tons of bud light to get my kicks.  GO, and enjoy one of Scottsdale's higher tier restaurants for the casual diner.
