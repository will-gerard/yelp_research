Always great. Always friendly. The four musts: honey walnut prawns, pillow tofu, orange chicken and hot and sour soup. Four of us last night got to have them all- best meal in Phoenix.

I love Postino.  How can you not?  I love the $5 glasses of wine before 5:00.  I love the staff.  Tell them what you like and they make the most perfect recommendations.  And nothing beats the bruschetta- I get cravings for that stuff.  The whole staff rocks at this location.  Very different (and better) vibe than Central.

Worst customer service ever.  I'll never shop here again.  I'll be happy to spend my money elsewhere.  I went in looking to buy a new laptop computer and I looked at all the laptops on display and I wasn't able to find what I was looking for. I asked someone if they could help me with laptops the woman said sure I can help you with laptops. I told her what I was looking for and she walked down the row looking at all the placards of the laptops I had just looked at and began reading them to me as if I can't read myself. When I asked if you could find me somebody who knew something about laptops she disappeared.  So I left the laptop department and walked over to the television department. Someone actually approached me to see if they could help. I told him what I was looking at he pointed and said they're all right there and then he walked away. How does this place stay in business. I'll go spend my two grand at Best Buy

It's all about the food, right?  Then this place is all right!!  The food was delicious, service professional, friendly and attentive.  I wish I lived closer.  I'd eat here all the time.

Sometimes a restaurant is more than the sum of it's parts. The outdoor patio is a great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. Start with a Mai-tai and the poke. The poke is always fresh and wonderfully tasty. A little more avocado would help though. For dinner, you can't go wrong with the burgers and get the side Caesar. Mmmmm. The fish dishes are also excellent but for my dollar, the burgers win out big time here. The ambience is awesome- great art on the walls and the staff is super  friendly. Kyle rocks!! Add it together and this has become my favorite place to grab a bite or take a date.

I had a massage by Jon yesterday.  And last night was the best night sleep I've had in weeks!  Jon gave one of the best massages I've ever had.  He's really good at what he does.  His understanding of the human body is evident in the way he did his work to help me de-stress and relax.  I would recommend Jon to anyone!! If I could give Jon 6 stars instead of 5 I would! He's that good!

I have a new favorite drink - the Home-ec Martini at culinary dropout. The food was good and the service top notch (thanks Brittany) but the martini(s) were great. The  pretzel fondue got us started and I would have that again but did I mention the Home-ec martini?  I'll be back.

First, I must say I love Citizen Public House.  I've eaten here four or five times and every meal has been delicious.  My favorite so far is the Scallops but the meatloaf is great too as is the filet.  The Chopped salad is a must have!!  And they make kick ass drinks here.   The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars is the overly attentive service.  The service can make of break a restaurant and the service here is good, but on two different occasions while I was dining here the servers kept interrupting to ask if we needed anything.  I was enjoying my company and conversation and both times had to let the server know to back off a bit.  And they didn't.  I appreciate attentiveness but this was too much.  I'd appreciate a little presence and intuitiveness over the constant tending to.   I won't let the minor complaint keep me away from this delicious food.

Worst customer service ever.   Makes me wonder when we're going to privatize the post office and fire these slobs who just don't care.

Rehab Burger wins on all measures.  Customer Service - Spectacular.   Food - delcious!!  We stopped by for lunch today and had a time crunch.  We let the hostess know and she actually checked with the kitchen to see if they could accomodate us!!  That's service above and beyond.  We decided to take our chances and stay and I'm so glad we did.  When we thought we weren't going to make it, the waitress offered to make our lunches to go.  We got our food - gulped it down and made it back to work.  They even brought to-go boxes with the food just in case.   Now, we would have gulped it down even if we weren't in a hurry because it was DELICIOUS!!  My medium burger was perfectly pink and I want more!!  My friend's medium well was also perfect.  The onion rings were beautiful and scrumptious.  Fries were great.  I'm sorry none of us orderred the "tots."  They looked great walking by.  I'll have to go back soon to try those out.  So, environment (tvs, sports, surf board, flip flops) - Thumbs up!  Food -Thumbs up!  Service - I'm out of thumbs so they just get a good tip!!  Thanks for a great lunch and great service.  I have a new favorite place to eat in Scottsdale.

Waiting for a table at the Windsor I wandered over to Hard Goods. Wow. What an interesting collection of stuff.  First, I loved the Eames chair in the window. Wish I had saved my parents chair from my youth. But the unique concrete creations are the true star of this boutique. Great products. Great staff. Lucas is awesome. Phoenix's secret gem

As a real estate agent it's important for me to have business partners who take care of my customers the way I want them taken care of.  If I refer my client to another business owner I'm putting my name and reputation on the line.  Hector, Edward and the rest of the team at the Hector Cerda Agency are spectacular.  They know their business and they know how to treat their customers.  So with high customer service, a high quality insurance product and a friendly team who are always available to answer your question how can you go wrong.

The food at Z'Tejas is just ok.  Except for the cornbread.  And the cobbler dessert. But this place gets a 5 star rating for the staff, the dining experience and the great service.  In a neighborhood filled with great places to eat, this Z'Tejas location should be in everyone's regular rotation!

It's breakfast.  Snooze turns it into a special meal.  Great menu, great service, great decor, great everything - except the wait.  I have never been to Snooze - weekend or weekday when I didn't have to wait at least 15 minutes - over an hour on weekends.  But I wait cause it's worth it.  I'm not one for the sweet pancakes though they are delicious.  I love the spuds with lots of fillings and a poached egg on top.  The benedict with the lox is killer good.  Go often - try everything!  I'm only giving four stars cause I hate the wait.

I learned about something new today. I was at the new Lola Coffee Bar at the Yard on 7th Street. They sell Kopi Luwak for $15 a cup. What is Kopi Luwak you ask? Kopi Luwak or civet coffee, refers to the seeds of coffee berries once they have been eaten and egested by the Asian palm civet. They harvest the coffee beans from the fecal matter of the civet (an asian big cat) and .... I stopped listening after hearing that and worked really hard not to laugh at Walter, the very nice and serious manager of Lola Coffee. He says its a delicacy people are willing to pay for. If you're interested he said to ask for the cat coffee. Good luck!  The new Lola Coffee at the Yard is very nice. They have some cool trendy coffees and machines (cold drip coffee anyone) that look very 50's sci-fi movie. The have tapas at night and a wine bar.  The decor is lovely and I look forward to making this a regular on my coffee rotation.

If you want a smart tax accountant you've found the right guy.  Jonathan and his team at JB Financial are extraordinary.  I trust my finances to him and recommend him to everyone.  HE manages my business and personal accounting and I couldn't function without him.

As soon as the sign went up for a Pita Jungle in the neighborhood I started to salivate.  The new place is nicely designed and very comfortable inside.  They've assembled a friendly, efficient staff and the food, as always for Pita Jungle is yummy and affordably priced.  They have my favorite hummus in town.  And now that I have Pita Jungle within walking distance I know it'll be a new regular spot for lunch and dinner!  And they make it so easy to place a to go order!  Tia at the register was working her tail off and smiling and providing awesome service to what seemed like a never ending line of customers - but that line moved so fast!! 5 stars for food.  5 Stars for service!!
