I was very excited to check this place out, it had been written up as one of the classic/oldest steak houses in Vegas so my co-workers and I went in with great expectations.  When we arrived the dinning room was almost completely empty, the hostess was very sweet and set us up in a nice booth. This is where things started falling apart, it comes down to just crappy service. The waiters, dressed in tuxes gathered in a group outside the kitchen and showed little to no interest in providing any level of service. When a waiter did show up to take my coworkers drink order my coworker  asked if they had any IPA's to which the waiter said  that they had Heineken my coworker pointed out that this was not an IPA which the waiter then disputed. I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself. I can't say enough about how bad the service was I'm pretty easy going but I was pissed my the time we were done eating. The food was good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars otherwise it would be one star.  When we were leaving  we told the hostess of our dissatisfaction and she took down our emails and assured us that we'd be taken care of and would receive some sort of compensation, over a week later this hasn't happened.

These guys went above and beyond in fixing my car. My AC kept going out and after several replacements they were able to resolve the issue with no additional cost to me. They are very friendly and have made sure that all my concerns are addressed.

The salads looked like it was directly out of a bag. The service was lacking in an almost empty restaurant. My girlfriends Shrimp Scampi was good but the Maryland Crab cakes weren't.  You know it's bad when you walk out see Panda Express and know you would have had a better experience there.

Went for a Valentines dinner and was dazzled. Great food great service. 2 cocktails, one appetizer, 2 entr√©es, 2 glasses of wine, and dessert for $140. Very reasonable.

This place does an amazing job. I go to a reflexology place every once in a while but those types of places are no where on the same level as this place. Good relaxing atmosphere.

I've been wanting to try this place out for a while finally did tonight. Bummed we didn't try it sooner. Sooooooo good. I'm currently eating a Paleo diet with can make eating out tough since it calls for just proteins, vegetables, and fruit that is prepared with out frying with all natural ingredients  (this is a simplified explanation) . This place had me covered (though those who like rice and pita your good to go here too). Great flavors, made fresh to order, and great costumer service. Super fresh salad bar with lots of healthy options. Try this place, you'll be happy you did.
