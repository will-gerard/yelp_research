Wow! What an experience!  Musica Mexicana is piped into the parking  I was approached by a woman just after parking, who asked if I was interested in some of her homemade tamales. She was a sweet woman but, no, no gracias. Entering the store I was overcome by memories of shopping with my Tias, (aunts) in Mexico so long ago. What I saw made my mouth water. Ensaladas, platos de carne asada, chorizos, filetes de Talapia, pan dulce (sweet breads) oh! and the cheeses! The meat prices you cannot beat. Steaks so red fresh you could almost see a heart beat. I recently bought a roast at another market for about $15. Here at the Ranch a roast 2.5 times the size was only $3 more!!  This place is BUSY. But from what I saw everything looked clean and there were people ready to help me with whatever I needed. I really loved this place.

What can I say? Reliably stocked. I can run in with the kids (four-legged kids) and not have issues.  Good selection(s) of food, toys, and necessities.

Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up, with everything you need and/or can think of.  (try the grilled veggies, flank steak ...everything.!!)

Without a doubt THE go to place for catering.  Diane and her amazing staff serve up some of the best food around and always with a smile.  Set-up is a breeze, tables, chaffing dishes.  The food has always been a hit with everyone at the office and they know when they see the Nibblers van pull up DELICIOUS food is on it's way.

I believe I have found the elusive... GREAT HONEST mechanic!  I stopped in to have my vehicle checked/prepped for the hot AZ months coming up.  Clean shop, great service.  Hours are a little difficult to work around working an 8 to 5 job but if my car gets this kind of great service..  I'll make arrangements.

Once again, I took my vehicle to Paul @ CCC and am an extremely happy customer.  I was able to drop my car off early.  I was given a phone call once diagnostics were finished an quoted a very fair price for my repairs. Everyone at the counter was absolutely a pleasure to work with.  This is my go-to person for regular maintenance and unexpected repairs.

Not that impressed.  Maybe I should have read other reviews from Google (http://maps.google.com/maps/place?hl=en&safe=strict&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=suntown&fb=1&gl=us&hq=suntown&cid=9747720966802647969)  Regardless, I took two white shirts and black capris in. Both shirts came back with stains still on them. I mention this because I took them to another cleaner and the stains were gone.  Again, not impressed.  :(

This place has apparently been open for 20ish years. My first visit was this morning. I stopped in on my way to the gym for a pre-workout drink to go. The lady behind the counter was the best. Knowledgable on all products I expressed interest in. Smoothies can be made as sweet or as clean as you want them to be. Prices on everything run from average to some really great discounts. I will definitely be visiting again.

.  Angel, daughter of the Lounge's owner Joy is a HOOT!!  I love her personality.  It's not a fancy place, little hole in the wall type place. They have been open for 8 years and have had a pretty steady following.  There is art on the walls (LOVE the Dizzie Gillespie painting... thinking of buying it) painted by a local artist.  Live music on Wednesdays/Fridays.  Wednesdays step classes (the Al B. look alike) and they have another separate dining-type area.  Wednesday nights they hold something called a conversation party.  Random 5 topics are chosen (we had a peek at last night's conversations) EX:  Are momma's boys a good or bad thing?   What makes a partner in a relationship think they need to start playing games?  What is most important to you in your professional career?  Apparently some of these discussions, as you can imagine - adding the alcohol ingredient - can get pretty heated.  It seemed to be a big group last night... 15-20 people.    So after dinner, catfish, PORK CHOPS TO DIE FOR!! So tender, fried hot wings, mac 'n cheese, mashed potatoes, LOTS AND LOTS of hot sauce, we heard the band start warming up.   YES!!  GREAT music.  People walked in wearing their Sunday best and others walked in wearing jeans.  It's an everyone knows everyone's name type of place.  Older people and the younger started trickling in around 8PM.    Definitely a fun experience.  Good times.

Wonderful!  Just amazing. With all the recent storms in Phoenix, trying to find someone to come over "asap" was proving to be quite the obstacle.  I called and just a few hours later I have two gentleman at my door and on my roof.  They were originally going to place a tarp until an estimator could come take a look but as it turns out they made a quick trip to Home Depot and not 20 minutes later they were done and my vent cover (brand new AND PAINTED to match my house) was installed and complete. Call these people.  Angelic in the office was very, very helpful with scheduling and payment.  Thank you.

A 'drive-by' decision and a good one!!    From the outside I wasn't expecting much because it is located in a strip mall. I was wrong. Its not too big of a place but has inside/outside patio choices for seating.   My sister had the Fettuccine Alfredo alla Pancetta. She cleaned her plate! (mind you this is NOT an everyday occurence.)  I had the Gamberetti alla Fra Diovalo (Shrimp and crab meat sauteed in a Fra Diovalo sauce served over linguini pasta) AMAZING dish. I've had diovalo elsewhere and they never seem to get the spicy balance just right. This dish did an amazing job. My shrimp was a little over-cooked but all-in-all I was VERY satisfied. Oddly, we did something we rarely do, ordered dessert!! YUMMY.  DEFINITE MUST TRY(s):  Pistachio Tartufo - Elegant pistachio ice cream covered with pistachios and chocolate sprinkles and the Lemon and Strawberry Sorbetto !!  I want to go back for  more and try different dishes.

Staff was VERY helpful when my parents & I dropped in for a few weekend DIY projects.  We ended up purchasing a few holiday lights to add to the decor around the house.  Parking was easy and shelves were well stocked.

I was looking forward to trying this place out since I had heard good things from friends.  The BLT I had was good tasting but my biggest issue was "where's the meat?"  The Bacon barely made enough to be two strips when pulled together. Very disappointed. A bread sandwich with lettuce, tomato and just a sprinkling of bacon. I will say the service was great, very friendly.

I'm partial to this place... I will admit this immediately. They come from my home state and know New Mexico chile and how it should be prepared. Chile rellenos, chile colorado, tacos and enchilads I've had them all. GOOD HOMESTYLE (Mexican homestyle) food. DO NOT forget to top your meal off with their homemade sopaipillas & honey. Never a complete dinner unless you have some.

Save yourself and try somewhere else. The taco and relleno plate was just horrible. A mush of egg and bad cheese. Taco was dripping oil.  My sister's huevos rancheros weren't much better.  Bland tomato sauce.  There is better food out there.

Weekend mornings... I crave their menudo. Best thing is I can ask for it the way I like it most: more maize and with red chile. Service is prompt and done with a smile. I have also had their chile colorado and fajitas (great menu items)

Yes you will have to wait. Is it worth it? YES. Today I visited with a friend of mine. I could smell the scent of bacon, coffee which fueled my appetite but I was craving a burger. You know a burger is good when no mayo, mustard, or ketchup are needed. Just the taste os a well cooked burger (side of kettle chips).  Expect a wait, most of the time. Come hungry. Waiting is outside (it is a very, very small building), but worth it. Next time, I will order the breakfast.

Pollo Relleno.. so amazing! (The plate is enough for two so bring a friend or come hungry (and thirsty ;) The plate came as: chicken breast stuffed with poblano chiles, caramelized onion, corn and goat cheese finished with poblano cream sauce. Delicious!!  Don't forget to try their calamari! Friday evenings, live music and great fun.

I love this place.  Lots of regulars and a place where "everybody knows your name"... and the name of your dog.  Both dogs and humas are very friendly and look out for one another. It can get busy at times but more fun for the dogs, right?

Sliders & drinks, a regular here (well at least up until I moved back to LA)  :)  Crowd is young & energetic, GREAT sports bar during NFL and Bball season.  GO SUNS!!!  There are small alcoves good for private gatherings which can accommodate varying sizes of groups.  Just call ahead they'll make it happen.

What a simple inexpensive way to truly spoil yourself or a friend. Drop a bath bomb, have a glass of wine nearby (or your choice of poison) and the stress of the day just melts.  I have been a fan but my love for these special treats was renewed when I was given some scrubs and bombs for my birthday. I feel so loved. Tonight is absolutely wonderful, yelping as I sit soaking is blue bliss. I recommend!!! Buy buy!  The chilled scrubs are a special treat in these hot temps. Yummy!

I live at the foot of this mountain so it's more than convenient to step out of the house and onto the trail.  There is a paved road up to the towers for an easier hike. (Incline still does a job on  your calves!! LOVE THE BUR) There is also another route up and over to the tower, rockier and some scrambling.

Service was great! (thank you, Patty!) Mimosa with my choice of oven-baked eggs. (Nice chunks of braised beef, so tender). Today is Sunday and there is live jazz. Great music but a bit too loud for my liking. Over all a nice brunch. No problem parking.

Every trip to Phoenix, I to my Native!!  HONEY HOT wings and a few to go. They have great bartenders who will whoop it up every now and then just to get everyone going. How? Hmm, games to win what else? Free alcohol. Great place, the service is on top of it.

I have to say I enjoyed this restaurant.  The salads fresh, scallops & steak cooked to perfection. Our server/service was very personable. Chatting it up with us while we waited for our plates. We went on a Tuesday evening, Bluesy live music was playing. STRONG tinis - whatever flavor you please.

Agree w/previous review... location was "off" or better unexpected.  As was the great service (THANKS! CHAD!) and drinks we had during our visit.  The other patrons were very welcoming and we all started up great conversations.  Shuffle board! YES!  This was my first time here and I can say that although it's not on my usual travel routes, I will actually go out of my way to stop by again.

Visited Steele Indian School park for the Arab-American festival.  We had a great time and it made for a great afternoon out in the cooler weather after being locked inside due to the AZ heat. The park was clean, with ample parking surrounding. The walk around the lake was peaceful. Nice break in the day.

Glass of wine with a trio of bruchetta: Salami & Manchego with Pesto, Fresh Mozzarella & Vine-Ripened Tomatoes with Basil, Warm Brie & Apples... what a lovely way to start the afternoon.  We decided to sit inside there was still a bit of chill in the air. Service was great and very friendly. Our sommelier "accidentally" poured us an extra glass of wine (Susana Balbo Crios, Torrontes). I was not about to complain. Great flavors were making me smile.   My sister had a panini, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. (POOF! the panini was gone.) Definitely coming back again.

I tried Peach Momotaro (blooming tea) once and I have been addicted ever since!!  I can say I have been Tea-ed for 4 years now. Momotaro has a sweet honey-like peach flavor that isn't artificial tasting.  It's a bit on the expensive side but when I want so spurlge a little this is where I go.

I am now on Team Jessica. Walk-in appt. and they seated me instantly. Thebfirst thing I noticed was that this place was spotless. Jessica quickly made me comfy with some bottled water and mags to read. Foot massage, sugar scrub, neck/shoulder masage and then on to my mani. I have been wanting to try the new shellac method and decided it was a go.i decided on a color (they are limited but I Bet more colors will come soon). End result: ECSTATIC. Total was $45 for both. Had I decided on a regular mani it would have been $35. Everyone was very nice and attentive. I am definitely coming back.

First timer today and WOW!! I am happy I tried it. I had the number 7 w/hot sauce on the side (don't forget that sauce)! Chicken breast plate with rice, salad, veggies and a spring roll. Salad was crisp, fresh as we're the veggies. Chicken was juicy and season just right. I will be stopping by again to try more things.

Coming from LA, CityScape left me wanting something a little more, BUT it is getting better.  You have the sports bars, neighborhood bars, sports events, comedy club, but unless there is an actual sporting event downtown, the CityScape area thins out after happy hour. I have hope.

Visiting during their 1 year anniversary.  $1 tacos, $1 beers, $1 tequila shots.  Three tacos, a beer for me and two tacos and beer for my sister.   $7 and we had dinner!  The place was clean. Service was quick. I do wish for more stools out on the patio as it was a great Saturday afternoon and we had to wait a bit to sit outside.  Good place. I enjoyed it.

This is the newest of the Zipps clan located off Bethany Home in Central Phoenix. It's a smaller bar but still a great place.  This used to be the old COX building so maybe that has something to do with all the HD TVs they have.  Practically every seat had a good view of the games going on.

I LOVE little ice crystals on my beer when it's been served to me. COLD beer. The service staff is absolutely great - remember your name for your next stop.    TVs are viewable from all over the bar. Have a special game you are interested in? Just ask, they'll tune it in for you.   Burgers are fab, from the Burger Studio next door. Great place to unwind and listen to some great CW music or watch the game.

Real workout with real results.  In just a couple of shorts weeks I have already noticed a difference and friends have noticed a change in my shape.  Following his method of weight training and customized meal plans my strength and endurance have increased tenfold.  Seth's professionalism, expertise,  and commitment to his clients make him stand out above all others.  I no longer feel any apprehension but actually look forward to getting my butt kicked every morning.  If you are looking for a great trainer who will motivate you to be your best, Seth Thurston is the right choice.

Walls are lined with cross-sectioned logs, place has an over all rustic feel. Glowing red bar adds some fun.  Definitely deserves a few returns.

Power button on my phone stopped working. Found iTech online and headed over. Located in a strip mall close to AZ Mills. They were very friendly and were able to fix my phone (while I had a drink & lunch @ the bar). 45 minutes later my fixed phone was back in my hand and working just like new. They also do some phone blinging. Adding sparkles or changing the glass to colored glasses, matching home buttons. Not for me but pretty nice looking. $45 to fix the power button. Happy customer.

Directly over-hanging the home plate / 3rd base view.. this place has bench seating, bar stools, couches, table / chairs setups to please most.  There are also several monitors playing the current game and other current running sporting events.  Services has been AMAZING!   If you want to leave your seat and have a sit somewhere more social with a clear view of the game, this is the place!

Walked in as our office is close by before lunch to see what the new salon was all about.  Clean and very welcoming.  Prices for a pedicure with hot stone massage started at $27.  Gel Manicure started at $30.  Queenie was my nail tech and did an amazing job.  My friend's nails were done by Jane who also did an amazing job.  They'll serve you up with muchies or something to drink - just ask.  So glad they opened.

Located in the Gainey Villages Shopping Center, Two Hearts Nails just opened recently.  Queenie did an excellent job on my gel manicure ($30) and my pedicure ($27) which included a hot stone massage.  Came in as a walk-in and was seating after about 5 minutes.  Great, friendly service.  There's a bar set-up for coffee, tea, waters. Will definitely be coming back.

Without even receiving my shed yet I will post a negative review based solely on service or lack there of. I was scheduled to receive a confirmation call the day before set up with a delivery window and no phone call came. I called and spoke to a saleswoman and she told me I would be receiving a call that all was fine.  The day of set up I called the office no answer and even called the salesman's mobile (via his bz card) no answer. Finally I sent an email asking why I have not yet (now 10:30AM) received a delivery window? I was then notified that my build had been cancelled and would need to be rescheduled! (Why did the saleswoman I spoke to previously not mention this??). This is NOT satisfactory! I had already taken the day off of work to be here. I received the General Manager's number who wasn't much more help. There was an excuse of issues with build crews and he would in fact need to reschedule. Yes, I would need to take yet another day off from work or "grant them access to my property." Why would I do that when I cannot trust them to even show up?  So without any offer to make up for their mistake I will have to take another day off from my work to be here. I am not happy and would NOT recommend Tuff Shed to anyone simply based upon poor customer service and lack of consideration for their customer. UPDATE: they have yet to show up for their rescheduled appointment and I am once again waiting. I was given a window of 7AM to 9AM is is now after 9AM.
