The airport is simply too big to deal with passengers effectively and efficiently. The waits for baggage are unacceptable. The parking is VERY unacceptable and now that the construction is going on to replace the shuttle buses from parking to the terminals plan on an extra half hour just to get from the airport to your car and vice versa. Also expect to pay thru the nose to park.  The only good thing about this airport is the mall level that provides a lot of stores and eateries to gobble up the long waits you'll have since you have to allow for so much time just to get here which is deep inside the metro area and prone to traffic snarls just to get to the airport.  Oh yeah... the free Wi-Fi? Forget about it! There are so many people on their network it crawls so slow you can't get anything done.  Security? Better plan on a long wait there too. My worst time was 45 mins. This airport seems to be a guinea pig too many times for new TSA procedures and tests.

I agree with Brian L. that their service was VERY SLOW and not at all what I am used to from this chain. They did not bring all of the food out at the same time either. The table next to us got three servers to bring all of their food out at the same time.  We got one who was clueless about what we ordered and if it was split up for the kids or if the order was wrong so we had to wait for a long second trip back to get the rest of the food. It was right after all.  The taste of the food did not meet my expectations.  A steak cooked to medium should be only pink in the middle, not red.  Food should be served hot, not cold.  As with any chain or franchise you expect the same level of consistency in service and food quality and when its not met then I feel it is the owner that does not care enough to hire good managers or monitor them.  When this happens, the brand name suffers overall so now I have to be wary of any Applebee's other than the one I usually go to on Ina Rd in Tucson which does serve good food and serves it pretty fast.  You would think Applebee's would be savvy enough to monitor social media reviews and investigate issues but its been three months since Brian L wrote his review so I guess the suits are "out to lunch" over at CrackerBarrel.

The park is big and spacious with lots of shelters for picnics and parties.  There is a very large shaded playground area with some unique equipment such as a monkey bar type thing you just grap on to and hang while it slides you about ten feet.  Its like a zip line.  I saw another playground that was like a miniature western town but we didn't check it out.  You can buy a book of 12 tickets for $10 or a wristband good for all day for $10.  The carousel and the train ride each cost two tickets per person.   The model train museum is free.  The Historical Railroad Museum and the Arboretum Railroad were closed because they were seasonal.   The train ride lasted 12 minutes and goes across two bridges and through one tunnel.  The carousel is big and the kids loved it.  The model trains were up kinda high and our 3 yr old was unable to see anything in half of the room.  There were no step stools or boxes provided  for the little ones to see those parts of the exhibits.  There were three large model train setups.  One O gauge, one HO gauge and one N gauge.  The O gauge was 90% complete with only about 10% under construction.  This is normal as those is model railroading know its never "finished."  The N gauge was about 60%-75% complete.  The HO gauge was not even half done and there were pictures of how it had taken almost three years to get that far.  It was interesting to see the various stages of construction and how it will be the most exciting to watch when it is all done.  The island in the middle will be at least three different levels.  The HO trains that were running were programmed to stop on a siding and let another train pass so that each train could use the single track tunnel going in opposite directions without crashing into each other.  I had never seen that before on any model train display.

I just love these new QuikTrips both in Phoenix and Tucson.  The drink and fast food eats selections are more plentiful.  I do not purchase gas here as I prefer name brands but I go out of my way to shop here for snacks daily.  Circle K could learn a LOT from QuikTrip. Circle K tried to copy their store format but got it wrong!  I went to a brand new one on Chandler Blvd and it only had one toilet for both genders and of course there was a line.  So I backtracked 3.5 miles to here just to use the facilities!  FYI: They have 4 toilets for the males.  So naturally they got my snack business as well.

Reminiscent of the old Popeye's that was in a gas station down the street from me off Thornydale in Tucson.  The sole Tucson Popeye's left now on the east side pales in comparison to this one.  This is one is hot, fast and cheap; exactly what you would want.  They are on the ball in putting together the orders and getting them into the customer's hands quickly.  The food tastes delicious.  I had the Shrimp Po-Boy and it was the bomb, just like Mister Ed's in Metairie, LA.  I could eat one every week (I used to when I lived there)!  The Red Beans and Rice was spicy good too.  They both made me long for going back to N'Awlins again just for a dining spree.  My grandson thought the mild chicken tender in his kid's meal was not spicy enough but then he eats his Taco Bell with fire sauce.  He liked the Cajun Fries too.  My wife got the mild Chicken Po-Boy.  She said the chicken was light (not greasy at all) and flavorful (not too spicy).  Her only complaint is that she could have used one more chicken strip if it was going to be served on such a large bun.  There was a lot more bread than chicken.  The fries were standard seasoned fare, she wishes she would have tried a different side.  If we lived here I would be a regular customer.   Somehow, I'll have to settle for waiting for our annual trip to Arizona Mills.

This is a great place to take children.  Large aquariums stocked with big colorful fish are everywhere. A really big fountain inside the restaurant adds to the ambiance as does all the moving animal displays and the whole feeling of being inside of an actual rainforest.  There are even thunder and lightning along with shooting stars.  The food is good enough and the service is adequate.

The restaurant had a comfortable but classy kind of country charm.  There was a nice size bar area and people seemed to be having a good time watching the game on the two large flatscreen televisions.  The regular dining area was a large room with several smaller areas off of the large area.  There was a mixture of square, rectangular and round wooden tables and chairs.  While we were there I saw the staff moving some tables together to create dining for a large group of people.  The lighting was low, more like a bar setting, but adequate.  We had reservations, via Open Table & the Yelp app, and were seated immediately.    Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered two Strawberry Q'ladas, a strawberry flavored Pina Colada, off the speciality drink menu.  We got our drinks then he took our order and food was at our table about 15 minutes later.  The drinks were very good, but we both wished they packed more booze.  The cornbread was brought to our table after our drinks but before our meal.  Both grandkids had to have some right away.  Both gobbled down their pieces and probably would have asked for more if they could have gotten away with it.    The Baby Back Ribs were outstanding; falling off the bone the way they are supposed to be but hard to get just anywhere these days.  I also had the Pecan Cole Slaw and fortunately for me, the pecans were sprinkled on top so I could scoop them off and eat the rest of the really good slaw.  The Ranch Beans were pretty unusual.  I have not tasted anything quite like them.  My wife said they had cinnamon in them but there were a bit too spicy for me so I shoved them off on my grandson, the "fire eating kid."  But I enjoyed what I had already eaten.  The cornbread was good but I really liked the super thin french fries I kept stealing off my granddaughter's kid burger meal plate.  My wife had the 8 oz Sirloin Steak and Baked Potato.  She asked that the steak be medium well and it was.  It appeared to be larger than 8 oz.  The potato wasn't as good as the steak; it could have been a little hotter.  It also came with a few thin onion straws that were a nice little surprise.  Before we left, we were surprised with some warm little donuts to take with us.  They were rolled in cinnamon and sugar and were just the right end to a delicious meal.  I asked the server if there was any chance the owners would open a location in Tucson because we would definitely be regulars.  But sadly, according to our server, both the owner and his kids are retirement age and the likelihood of a Tucson location appears to be extremely slim.

This restaurant is barely acceptable. I've always had trouble getting seated as there is never any hostess on duty. The food is barely edible sometimes. The service is slow and inattentive. Chili's is known for bad food and poor service in many cities. I've seen many locations close down for this reason. I wonder how much longer this one will continue. After several tries at their breakfast I no longer eat here.

It seems fast foods places get my order wrong more than they get it right. After being told they were out of onion rings and tarter sauce, they offered to substitute of mayo for tarter; I said no thank you. The receipt stated that request correctly. But the manager filled the order incorrectly not once but twice. First time I received a chicken sandwich instead of the fish I ordered. Second time I got the fish, which was good so I'll bump from 1 to 2 stars for that, but it had mayo on it. I choose BK for their onion rings which they failed to provide. Heads up Airport BK, failure to provide all menu items regularly is a violation of your franchise agreement so don't be surprised when you lose it.

We tried to make reservations about an hour ahead of time but they were booked up for reservations.  But not all tables can have a reservation.  So we decided to just go anyway and were seated right away.  The place is huge and has more tables than I could count.  The bar area is also very large with many booths and tables.  The menu had so many choices it was hard to decide.  So many cajun dishes too.  Our appetizer was shrimp cocktail.  It came with 9 shrimp instead of the usual 6 served at most places.  The cocktail sauce had a half teaspoon of straight horseradish sauce for those who may want to kick it up a bit.  We prefer less kick and dipped around the sauce.  It was a great way to start the meal.  My wife and I split a small order of fried shrimp (8). It was served already split in separate plates which was nice. The shrimp were butterflied, light and crispy, delicious.  She also ordered the stuffed shrimp and a baked potato loaded.  The shrimp were rolled in a rich crab stuffing which was seasoned perfectly.  The baked potato was huge, hot and smothered with all kinds of goodies (butter, sour cream, bacon, chives, celery).  She ordered the smaller portion that came with two stuffed shrimp.  If you get an appetizer this is the size you should get, more than she could eat and she loved every bite.   I ordered the Shrimp Creole.  It came with a side of cheese grits with andouille mixed in.  The creole was not too spicy like a lot of places.  The sauce was full of veggies and chunks of tomato.  It was outstanding and worthy of a repeat order.   My wife had a frozen margarita blended and sipped on it throughout dinner.  I had Cabernet Sauvignon by the glass.  Our server was sweet, spunky, and very attentive.  She was enthusiastic and genuinely wanted us to enjoy ourselves and our dinner.  We both probably ate too much but everything was cooked and seasoned so well, it was almost impossible to stop eating.  A truly memorable meal which these days is hard to find.

We were in the Phoenix area over the holiday weekend and wanted some Chinese food.  We did a search on Yelp for Chinese Buffets and the Eagles Buffet came up.  The reviews were really good so we thought we would give it a try.  It was a little difficult to find because I followed the Yelp directions which took us a couple of miles out into the middle of nowhere.  So I had to enter the street address into Google Maps to find it.  Once we realized it was inside a casino, we didn't have any problems.   After we arrived and were seated, we discovered that this was not a Chinese buffet but a Sunday brunch buffet.  While my wife was initially disappointed not to get her Chinese fix, she wasn't disappointed for long.  They had anything and everything you would want on the buffet.  Breakfast offerings included eggs benedict, bacon, link sausage, hash browns, scrambled eggs, french toast, bananas foster, pancakes or omelets made to order.  There was grilled ham with pineapple, roast beef, green beans, potato wedges, baked halibut, steamed salmon, for those who preferred lunch.  Multiple salad options, cole slaw, fruit, caesar salads to spinach salad.  All kinds of bread, savory and sweet.  My favorite was the boiled shrimp and the fried shrimp.  The fried shrimp was excellent, light and crispy.  The boiled shrimp was a perfect match with the slightly spicy cocktail sauce.  The shrimp alone was enough to keep my wife and I satisfied, I filled up a half plate three times.  The grandkids found plenty of choices to choose from as well.  The granddaughter focused on breakfast, eating multiple links of sausage and pancakes.  Our grandson focused on lunch, with the grilled ham, assorted cheese cubes, spinach salad, and various breads.  While eating their meals, they were already talking about the desserts and what they wanted to try.  There was enough dessert options to please anyone, included sugar free selections.  I had two pieces of pie; the grandson had three dessert shooters and a chocolate ice cream cone.   I am not usually a fan of buffets because I often find the food unseasoned and bland, this was not the case at Eagles.  Everything was seasoned and flavorful.  It was more expensive than we would normally spend on a dinner meal, I can say everyone left with their bellies full and ready for a nap.  The servers were attentive and kept our dishes cleaned off the table while refilling our drinks.  I would not recommend this as an every Sunday meal but occasionnally this would be a very nice treat!

Good fun for the kids for an hour but way over priced.  Our 10 year old grandson enjoyed it much more than our 3 year old granddaughter.  He got to touch a starfish, shark egg and a sea urchin.  If the price had been $25.00 vs $53.70, it would have been worth that.  By the way, our price was discounted $12 for purchasing online so paying at the door could have been much higher.  The attractions they do have on display are nice and they do share information about the animals throughout the tour.  There just wasn't enough to see and not enough room to maneuver.  We visited on a Saturday and with the crowds, and all the strollers, it was hard to see, and hard to walk.  I felt rushed to get out of people's way.  We came away feeling ripped off.  The kids said they had a good time but the grandson wished there had been more hands on things to do.  The jelly fish room did not impress me at all.  It seemed like too much space was devoted to one species, some of the tanks were cloudy, the kids breezed through this part fast.  I liked being able to climb stairs and observe the sting rays from above but like other reviewers, felt sorry for the fish and as they made the same circular patterns repeatedly obviously frustrated with captivity.  There is an indoor playground like some of the fast foods have at the end of the tour.  And then the exit leads you into the gift shop where they hope you will spend additional money.  The little one needed to use the restroom and since we didn't see any facilities here, we just left without shopping in the gift shop.   I wish they had a large aquarium in the Phoenix area like I have seen in some cities.  New Orleans has a nice one.  This place is obviously relying on customers to foot their entire bill of maintenance and upkeep.  Large aquariums solicit private donations from foundations and sponsorships from businesses to offset costs so the public doesn't have to dig deep into their wallets just to see the attractions.  I would not recommend touring Sea Life unless you think $50-$60 for one hour of entertainment for four people is a good value.
