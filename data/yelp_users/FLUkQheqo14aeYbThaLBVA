Looks like they have pre-made cooked pizza.  ie cheese, pepperoni and then place your other ingredients on and place it in the oven when you order the crust was bad, pizza was bad. Garlic knots were good. Won't be ordering again

I've been here for 4 days and I struggle to find many positive aspects of my visit. I haven't been diagnosed after 4 days, I sometimes go up to 6 hours without a nurse visit to my room. The Doctor was suppose to talk to me directly after a Friday 4pm surgery to tell me what he found. Well it's Saturday at 9am and no one has heard from him. I'm frustrated and feel like this hospital has a lack of care and talent.

I am currently having another extended visit at Mercy Gilbert. I can say that my experience has been much better this time. I'm receiving more attention from the Doctors, Nurses and other staff.  My condition continues to be a mystery but they are consulting other Doctors and Surgeons to find answers. I'd like to thank a lot of the nurse staff up on the 4th floor for the excellent daily care I'm receiving. If my review was strictly about them I would be giving 5 stars.

Best Pho around. The broth has a deep flavor that comes from taking the time and using the right ingredients to do it right. Also try the spicy green bean appetizer and the Hong Kong Beef.  I usually go at least once a week.

Used to be a great dependable places when they first opened but my experiences have been worse and worse over the last year. The prime rib is absolutely the worst. I've had comparable prime rib on board a navy ship. Overdone, grayish looking and pretty pricey.  Seems like there is always some mistake or slip every time we go. In all honesty I am rating them against comparably price establishments. If the keg were a lot cheaper I might give 3 or 4 stars. But cost and quality are not in line here.

It took 1.5 hours to be seen. The staff was friendly but not very "urgent" worst of all the facility needs to be cleaned very badly. A bit disgusting.

I had the elk loin and my wife had the bison. Both were very good. The elk was one of the best tasting meats I ever had. The bison was a little bland and tough comparatively. My wife and I share an accompaniment of cauliflower with cheddar which was very bland.  They also have no beers on tap which is an automatic deduction for me. I would go back. The price is as suggests. Expect to pay $150-200  per couple.

Really liked it here. The lunch special is great and comes with salad and egg rolls. Flavors are very clean and spiced really well. They let you choose between mild-hot also. They gave us extra rice for take home as well. Wish it was closer so I could come back often.

Love this place. I'm my opinion the best Steak House in Chandler/Gilbert for your money. Always good quality, attention to detail, good atmosphere and reasonably priced.

Very disappointed. I asked the woman on the phone what kind of thin crust they had she said just the regular kind. Turns out out they use a thin crust pre made in some factory somewhere. It's basically a tasteless wafer. The fact that the person that works there doesn't know that good pizza places actually take the time to make their own crust says everything you need to know about Genos. Too bad because the toppings weren't bad. The crust was almost un edible. You'd think in today's world where people are becoming more food aware and critical that owners wouldn't take these shortcuts.

Best Gelato in Arizona. There is a reason why the line is always out the door. We go back as often as possible.

Stopped in today and ordered a beef philly with onions, peppers, jalape√±os and cheese. I really like the sandwich. The bread was soft and easy to eat. The beef was tender and tasty. I will be back. Oh they also serve Thrifty brand ice cream which is very good.

I purchased the "VIP" wash for $20. They wanted me to drive my own vehicle through the car wash. WTF. Secondly when I picked up my car it had no fresh scent put in it and they forgot to wash several parts of the interior including the dash, the part of the vehicle I will be looking at all the time. What a joke this car wash is. Never going back.

Todd from Dukes of Air came to my home to conduct a tune-up of all my AC systems. He was very knowledgeable and courteous. I will use the Dukes for all my future services.

Mark came over to our home in Gilbert and did a fantastic job on our tile floor. Before he cleaned  the grout lines look like something out bad horror movie, dark, dirty scary to look at. When he finished cleaning my wife and I were so happy with the outcome we immediately started looking for more areas that needed attention.

Food is very good and they have some interesting cocktails. I do not go anywhere else in Gilbert if I'm looking for seafood. Quality is excellent, calamari steaks are great.

Excellent. The dragonfruit bowls my wife and I had were excellent, healthy and organic. The owner and employees are extremely knowledgeable about the good they are selling as well. Also they sell a kombucha by the bottle or on tap that is the best I've ever.  is made in Sedona which is organic and local. I was told about yoga classes they have on the green belt next to the store that in interested in checking out with my wife. Overall the Spirit Bar is a great addition to my regular spots for organic, healthy and local fare.

Really enjoyed our first visit here. Right when you walk in your nose says yummy. We ordered the ceasar salad and that was excellent, the onion and garlic wings were decent but I wouldn't order them again. We also are the Capo pizza which was excellent. Very thin crust with excellent fresh ingredients. The charcoal oven really adds some great flavor the the food. I would recommend this to anyone in the area.

Love this place. Owned and ran by a father and his daughter. They really want you to get the taste of real Italian flavor with un compromised ingredients. The pastrami sandwich will literally change your day. You'll find yourself telling your family, friends and coworkers about it the rest of the day.

I'm not a huge fish taco fan. I do like the non fish tacos here as well as the side dishes. They usually have good beer also. Wouldn't be my first choice for tacos but the people I usually eat with enjoy the fish tacos and say they are the best around. I find the fish a bit fishy.

What an awesome place. The food is great with some offering spins put on it. The wait staff can and will tell you enthusiastically were the ingredients and products they use come from. Definitely a sense of pride here what for they are putting out.  Location is also great. Can't wait to go back.

I didn't have high expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. We initially were going to go to Frost but the line was insane. We walked right into Scooptacular, no line just great service. The young man working the shop was very enthusiastic about the business and products. He told us it's it's a family owned business and directed is to a few different flavors which he eagerly offered up samples . I ended up having the coconut almond joy in a sugar cone and it was freaking delicious. As I write this review I'm wishing I had more. At least enough to eat myself into a coma. My wife had the peanut butter cup and dang was it delish. Like I said I wasn't expecting much but I will be back for all my ice cream needs.

Went for the second time today. Both times we were unable to get seated and were asked to wait. Well there's no where to wait unless you like standing next to tables with people eating. not enough tables even though they have an empty patio. Basically they make you feel like it's inconvenient for them to have you there. To bad because the menu and food look very good.

We have had a hard time getting in because the place is very small. The food is nothing short of great though. Highly recommended. My wife and I have dined at most of the Thai restaurants in the area and this joint has the best food.

Atmosphere, food, staff were all spot on. The food is worth coming back for and when you add on a friendly staff and a great environment to spend an afternoon or evening eating and drinking you got yourself a winner. "I'll be back" said in my best Schwarzenegger voice.

Always looking for a new Pho spot. This one opened not long ago. It's very clean, the owners and staff are very friendly and very proud of the Pho broth. The owner took me through the process of making Pho and let me tell you it's gotta be a labor of love. Glad someone does it. This one in particular is delicious with a deep natural flavor of beef bone, onion and ginger. I'll be back often to have this delectable bowl of Pho.

I've been here several times. I've waiting to write a review based upon previous reviews and was expecting to have a similar experience eventually. Mostly I have not had a bad experience yet. I tend to only go during lunch hours though.   The bad ; its expensive from the food to the drinks, they also don't have the MLB package which is something I expect for weekday afternoon drinking in the summertime, and the wait staff seem a bit snotty.   The good: food has been excellent every time, mixed drinks are delicious and the bartenders give excellent recommendations and unlike the wait staff the bartender staff has been fun and friendly nearly every time I've gone.   My recommendation is go for lunch, sit at the bar, order some food to share and have a 1 cocktail. After that switch to beer or water unless you want a large bill.
