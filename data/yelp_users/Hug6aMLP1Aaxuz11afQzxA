This place is awful. I remember I went to there to have a great time, but a security guard came by that I've been taking pictures which I really didn't at all. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. Stick to Calico Jack's, Saddle Ranch, and Hell's Half Acre.

Awesome place to be in Westgate. I went one time and it's amazing. The food, the drinks, the events, the works. Hands down another of Westgate's great bars. Go there and you will be amazed!!! I will definitely go back for me. One of my top 5 places besides Calico Jack's, Hell's Half Acre, and Saddle Ranch.

The first time I saw Panera Bread, I wasn't sure what to expect. But once I went inside and order the food and ate, I was very delighted by the great food and service. I highly recommend go to Panera Bread. It's amazing!
