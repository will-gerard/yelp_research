I love this place. Been going to Hilton Village Starbucks since 2006. It's awesome. Their crew always treats me well and has my drink ready when I am there as they know me. It's fun to go to a place where they treat you with respect and go out of their way to make you feel special.

We've been shopping this particular store since we moved here over 4 years ago. The crew that works it are always friendly with us, give great service and go out of their way to ensure a great experience for my wife and myself. We love them like family and go out of our way to avoid other stores just for the experience here.  We hope you'll do the same. Say hi to Stacey, Catharine, Darla, and the rest of the awesome gang there.

Myself, my wife and our dog love this place. Fun to get out and see people and their pets having fun. What's interesting is people watching to see how much the pets match their people :)  It'd be great if more people there would participate in picking up what their animals leave, but sometimes laziness does over take them and we end up doing it.  Our dog loves to run and play with the others and from time to time she airs her issues, but other than that it's a wonderful place to get out and enjoy the grass and be around people. Great place, highly recommended. Please police your animal droppings!  Mike

Just back from here. Great time excellent service/happy hour. Better spicy tuna hand roll than Sapporo of Scottsdale. Highly recommended. This is a place definitely worth checking out. We finally did and we will go back.

Had an excellent experience here prepping our meals there and one of the best things was how great the food is. In fact the reason I am here writing this is that I opened a package of food to cook and wow is it awesome! Greg was really helpful getting us shown around and getting things working. Great Job Greg!! Thanks for making our day.

To be honest, I went on a date here. Thanks Match :-) (have been using Match for many, many years, long story there)...but met a gal that I'd connected on that site with, for lunch at Majerle's.   First off the door greeter, forgot her name (she was really cute though) because she was awesome, recommended various dishes, shared how much she loved the place... "You're biased! You work here I said!" "You're right, but before I came to work here, I ate here and completely loved it! In fact, you should try these..." and then she rattled off some things to try, which I ended up trying one of the dishes and she was right...AWESOME.  I had a bleu cheese burger for lunch. Pretty tasty, a lot of food for the price. Is that good? Not sure what their books are showing for a profit, but the size of the bread on that burger could be cut by about 1/2 and you'd still have a nice burger. The bun was so large that I had to cut it in half to eat. Mostly bun, the burger was cooked as requested, so no problems there at all.  Now, what does bother me as that normally when I bring a burger home or even to a hotel and put it in protective wrapping, then later on warm it up to have the remainder of it to eat, the results are not what I experienced from this burger. I reheated it in a microwave and after eating it became very sick and spent most of the night close to the porcelain throne just to make sure the world knew that I was King for that night.  Am sure it's probably just a fluke, but it could have been anything that was in that burger as I'd not had any other food during the day and this was an afternoon seating, around 2pm or so on Monday the 5th.  Additional information, the waitress assumed I guess that we were previous guests and was a bit rushed. Normally when I was waiting tables and was VERY successful at it, I would greet my tables and ask them "Have you been a guest here previously? Or is this your first time?". When I did that, I was able to establish rapport with my people and basically sell them anything on the menu that I desired them to enjoy and would reap the rewards via tip and remarks to my manager on the way out. When we left, the tip reflected the amount of service and there was not a manager in sight, otherwise I'd have been having a few words about the experience with them.  Not sure I'll be back to this chain of restaurants as I am sure there others out there who'd not only appreciate my business, but also my words of review when that time comes. I don't wish to be coddled, but I do expect to have a great meal no matter what time of the day it is and I expect value for what I am paying, and lastly I expect that the establishment will be guarding its own profits and providing not too much, but just enough to keep people talking and coming back for more.
