First off let me say that up until tonight I was a huge fan of Rubios. I would always order their grilled shrimp tacos or bean and cheese burrito. It always tasted fresh and wasn't greasy. However, tonight I decided to try their new California bowl. I was expecting it to be somewhat similar to Chipolte's burrito bowls. Well . . . the concept was, but in reality it was not even close. The rice was clearly over cooked as it was all mushed together and had no flavor. I assume it is called the California bowl because of the guacamole. However, the amount of guacamole was highly disappointing. Once I mixed all the bowl ingredients together, I couldn't even taste the guacamole which is the best part. I added chicken and again highly disappointed with how much chicken they added. I could barely taste that there was even chicken. Overall, the NEW addition to the menu was a huge disappointment. In the future, Chipolte will be the only place I go for a delicious burrito bowl.  On a side note, I was also disappointed when Rubio's stopped carrying carnita's. They have two strikes against them in my book.

I love Cibo!!! They have this delicious salad with a pesto dressing and I add their tuna on it. MMMMM Their tuna salad is not like regular tuna salad, because they don't use any mayo. They use olive oil and spices, so it is healthier, but still has a lot of flavor. I have had their pizza before and it is very good as well. Great place and prices for happy hour. I would definitely recommend everyone try Cibo. :)

I love their gluten free pizza crust! They also have really yummy hot wings. I wish their prices were a little bit less, but I guess it is worth it. :)

A very good friend of mine referred me to Carla one of the owners that she has been going to since high school. I recently moved to the north Phoenix area and needed to find a new salon in my new area. Carla was able to schedule me an appointment the day I contacted her. She did a terrific job while being quick and efficient. I left feeling like I had a new head of hair. The price was also very reasonable since I just get a wash, cut, and style. No color. I think I found my new place and  stylist! Will be more than happy to go back in a couple months. :)

Enjoyed a lovely lunch here today to celebrate a good friends birthday. Hob Nobs is in this adorable old little house conversation. Loved that they had live entertainment even at lunch time real low in the background. The woman singing even sang Happy Birthday to my friend after one iffy coworkers notified one if the employees. It was very sweet and my friend was quite surprised and touched.   Today they had a kale salad as a special. It was absolutely delicious with the combination of kale, candied walnuts, grapes, avocado, and poppy seed dressing. In addition to sharing the kale salad, my friend and I also shared the albacore tuna salad sandwich on marble rye. The tuna had a lot of flavor and matched perfectly with the marble rye bread. We both had iced tea and you could tell it was freshly brewed.

I am adding to my below previous review, because I went here recently and it seems they changed the California Benedict slightly and not for the better. It used to come on toasted sourdough which was delicious and part of what made it a California. This last time it came out on a different kind of bread un-toasted. I'm not even sure what kind of bread it was, but it really changed the flavor of the Benedict in its entirety. Also, the roasted red potatoes had way too much seasoning on them that I could barely eat them. It was a disappointing visit considering my friend and I used to frequent this place all the time.   My best friend and I finally got around to trying out Benedict's last weekend. Benedict's is a small quaint cafe that also offers cooking classes. The eggs benedict is what drew us in as it is a breakfast dish favorite. We both decided on the California benedict that was served on sourdough bread instead of a traditional English muffin. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly which isn't always the case when I order a benedict. We both thoroughly enjoyed our eggs benedicts and thought the prosciutto was a nice touch combined with the tomato and avocado. I was also very excited that they had a pumpkin spice latte as pumpkin season is my favorite. It was delicious and very comparable to Starbucks which I was quite impressed by. I did purchase the deal on Yelp and was able to use it right then which was a nice little savings. The two gals that run the place were really nice and friendly. My only critique would be that the service could be improved. Our server forgot our water and when it came time to pay we waited a while with our cards on the bill and eventually had to go inside to get their attention. All in all it was a good experience and we will go back.

Kim is fantastic! She is so friendly and genuinely cares about you being happy with the results. I can't wait to go back and see her for another derma-plane and glycolic peel. My face feels and looks amazing!

I originally looked at Tryst Cafe as a brunch possibility a few weeks ago, but didn't end up getting to there. There brunch menu and the photos on yelp made it look amazing. I am hoping to try out their brunch soon. I did get to try out their dinner last night with a friend. My friend and I started off with the battered green beans appetizer that comes with like 6 different dipping sauces. I was a big fan of the cilantro aioli. For dinner, we both got the Ahi Tuna melt with brie cheese on a parmesan crusted brioche bread. It was absolutely delicious and we would both recommend others order it. The sweet potato tots that we had as a side instead of the salad that normally comes with it were a great compliment to the sandwich. Of course, we had to finish off our meal with their crème brule that had fresh strawberries and blackberries on top. It was a great end to a great meal. The crème brule was delectable to say the least. Overall, we had a great experience and an amazing meal. Even though we didn't try any of their cocktails, I did look at the cocktail menu and am excited to try one of them my next visit. I have my eye on the pear margarita. :)

Love love love 32 Shea! I just tried their seasonal pumpkin pie spice latte with almond milk. Delicious!!!! I normally get the one from Starbucks, but after trying 32 Shea's for the first time yesterday it is my new favorite. They also have really good happy hour prices for food and drinks. The patio is super cute and really great when it is nice out. This place is great all around. Be sure to go check it out. :)

I thoroughly enjoyed my first Primp and Blow experience. Linda was very nice and friendly and gave me one of the best facials I have ever had. She has a lot of experience and knowledge which I liked. She customized my facial to what my face needed not just what my appointment was for. You could tell she cares about the clients needs and took her time to do a great job which is not always the case when getting a facial or spa service. I would definitely recommend Linda to anyone who wants an amazing facial. I will definitely go see her again. :)

Love love this nail salon. My best friend and I have been coming here for awhile now, so the two sisters that own the salon know us well. This is the only nail salon I have been to that uses hot stones with all their pedicures which is my favorite part.i would highly recommend this nail salon due to the friendly staff, excellent value, and you definitely get your money worth. They won't hurry to get you in and out, they take their time and make sure your nails look perfect.

My coworker and I were looking for a place to go to lunch the other day. She said that I had not steered her wrong yet on picking restaurants based on yelp reviews. Zookz Sandwiches helped me continue with my success. Their sandwiches are unique and delicious. I would describe them almost like a fresh hot pocket, but way better than a hot pocket.The owner is super nice and let my friend and I try the kale salad, cause she said it was a must. She was absolutely right! the kale salad was amazing and I will definitely be ordering it my next visit. We both thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and experience. My coworker even went back the next day with another coworker.  :)

My friend/coworker took me here for lunch today cause she really likes it and knew I had never been. The staff was friendly and attentive. We both had ice tea and it was very refreshing. The orange slice in the ice tea gave it a little extra something. Then we started with the Mister Mister appetizer which was a combination of baby zucchini, artichokes, sweet potatoes, and mozzarella cheese tempura'd served with two different sauces. For our main meal we shared the Federal Chop salad and the Casanova pizza which had dates,ricotta cheese, prosciutto, arugula, and pecorino. Everything was amazing and I would definitely go back and recommend to others.

My best friend and I wanted to try a new place for my birthday dinner. I looked on Yelp and saw that EVO had a lot of good reviews, so I looked over their menu and it looked like exactly what I was looking for. EVO provided some of the best service I have ever seen at a restaurant. Our waiter Tony was awesome and super attentive. We loved his facial expressions with every course that we ordered solidifying that we were ordering well. For cocktails, I had the peaches dream and it was quite refreshing and tasty. My friend had the Monroe's Mule and enjoyed hers as well. To start we shared the Focaccia Rustico which was amazing and you won't find anywhere else. If you are a fan of brie, marscapone, and honey then this is a must. I had the mushroom risotto and my friend had the lobster risotto for our main courses. Both were unique and delicious in their own ways. To end on a high note, we had the Nutella cannolis which were just enough and the perfect ending to this perfect meal and experience. To say that I highly recommend this restaurant is not enough. It is definitely a MUST to visit as you won't be disappointed and you don't want to miss out.

First of all, Robin our server was fantastic! She was friendly, funny, knowledgeable, and didn't steer us wrong on any of her suggestions. My  friend and I just tried this place for the first time because of the bacon board appetizer. It was absolutely delicious. I started with their mojito, which was one of the best I have ever had. my friend tried some if the different moonshine flavors amd the copy cat cocktail. she enjoyed all of her beverage choices. I then had the house smoked turkey open face sandwich and my friend had the crispy chi ken sandwich. We both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches. Lastly, we shared the peach and blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious and a great summer dessert.

I was in desperate need of a car wash, so I decided to try out Jacksons since I was in the area. I really needed the inside to get a good scrub down. First of all, like most car washes they uphold me from the car wash that I was already decided on. I figured I really wanted a good car wash so I went ahead and did the next one up. As soon as I got in my car I noticed that they didn't even clean out one of the cupholders which is part of what needed to be clean the most and the rest of the center console. Needless to say this did not meet my expectations for paying $17 for a car wash, so I will not be visiting this car wash again or recommending them to a friend or anyone I know.

I had heard great things about this place and decided to try it this past Friday. I was not impressed to say the least as my experience was pretty underwhelming. First of all, for ice cream this is way over priced. I paid $7.00 for one scoop of ice team with a brownie bottom and the brownie was just ok. The person taking the order should have warned me that if I picked the coconut milk as the base that it could overpower the actual flavor I pick for my ice cream. I picked Nutella, but it just tasted like coconut. Needless to say, it was far from worth $7.00. My sister and friend I was with were pretty underwhelmed as well and also thought the prices were too high for what you get. My sister got a topping which you have to pay a $1.00 extra for and they basically gave her candy dust for what should have been Reese cups. If your charging people extra for a topping, don't be stingy on the serving. I'm not sure this place will last. People will like the idea and concept, but not the price.
