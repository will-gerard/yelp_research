I got a groupon to The Brow Lady for eyelash extensions. I was a little wary as the reviews are a healthy mix of good and bad BUT...I had a great experience! Marie put on my eyelashes and she is pretty darn amazing. The first time I was really nervous and wanted lashes that had a lot of oomph but also ones that looked totally natural. Sounds like that might be hard to pull off, but she did it! When I saw my sister a few days later she asked what kind of mascara I was wearing to make my lashes look so amazing, she didn't even guess they were extensions! I've been back for 1 fill and Marie did a great job again. The lashes are expensive to maintain (~ $100/ month) but the pricing here is competative. I can't speak for any other services or employees at The Brow Lady but when it comes to Marie and lashes, this place gets an A+

My husband and I love this place, it is definitely our go to spot for Thai food. Every once in a while, we dine in but we usually do take-out. I am an annoying customer here, I always get Pad Thai and I modify the heck out of it. They get it right every single time though! A few other favorites of ours are the crab rangoon and the vegetable spring rolls...delish! My only complaint is the spice level is NOT consistent. I used to order a 3 spice level and sometimes it was so hot I literally couldn't eat the meal and sometimes it had no spice at all. I've complained a number of times about this and their answer is to order a lower spice level and ask for more spice on the side. Doesn't seem like quite the right approach to me, I feel like restaurants should be consistent. But, like they suggested, I now order a 2 with extra spice on the side. Sometimes the 2 is really spicy and I don't need it, sometimes I use all the extra spice. Overall though, we definitely recommend this place!

Love love love this place! Bandera is our benchmark; Whenever my husband and I try a new restaurant we always compare it to Bandera. Maybe that's one of the reasons we keep coming back here so often! As many new restaurants as we try, very few measure up to this place. There are so many things I love about Bandera I need to make a list, paragraph form just won't cut it. 1. Consistency. In my experience very few restaurants can pull off making the same dish exactly the same way every single time. Bandera does. We go back over and over again for our favorites and it always tastes exactly the way it's supposed to. 2. Food. It's amazing. Some of our favorites:      -grilled artichokes      - corn bread (my arteries hate me afterwards but seriously, best corn bread ever)      -macho salad      - crispy chicken sandwich      - peanut cole slaw      - every single fresh seasonal vegetable they serve      - banana cream pie 3. Service. Always friendly. Always knowledgable. Love that I can start a tab at the bar while I wait for dinner and they transfer it to the dinner table, no questions asked. And yes, the bartender is tipped out appropriately on this transfer so I don't have to worry about that.  4. Take out. It's hard to find take out that tastes as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Sometimes you just want to eat something delicious in your pajamas and on your couch! And as many times as we have ordered take out from Bandera (and it's been a lot of times) they have never once messed up our order or forgotten anything. Seriously! That never happens but here, it just does.   So, long story longer, we love Bandera. If you've been hopefully you've had the same amazing experiences we have. If you haven't been, GO! And order yourself a home made margarita while waiting for dinner, it's amazing.

We've been here for brunch/lunch a few times and always enjoy it. They've got some different options, (that I like to think are on the lower calorie side, though I am probably fooling myself) such as the Brussel Sprout salad (YUM!) and the Kale Salad with quinoa. I really enjoyed eating both and didn't feel like I was missing out on anything because both were legitimately delish! When the weather is cooler the patio is nice too, nothing like sipping Sangria in the sunshine! Overall, always an enjoyable experience. And don't forget to snag one of the complimentary mini salted chocolate chip cookies on your way out the door!

The only reason I am giving this place 2 starts is because we did not do the indoor mini golf or the laser tag, so I feel it is unfair to give it a 1 when we didn't experience everything Jambo had to offer. BUT, our experience definitely was't great. I took my nieces, one is almost 4 and the other almost 5, during the day. First thing, there are signs at the front of the place warning that some of the rides are broken. Kind of a bummer, but whatever, I had a Groupon and we were going in anyways! Girls had to use the bathroom right away so we headed to the restroom and GROSS. Floor is dirty. One of the stalls had pee everywhere. No toilet seat covers to be found. OK, whatever, told the girls to touch as little as possible and we washed thoroughly and headed out to play! Rode the swings first, the girls loved it! Rode it a few times and then some older kids (I'm talking teenagers here, probably 12-13 years old) got on. They were swinging their individual chairs back and forth and around so hard that chairs were flying everywhere. The kid in front of my niece somehow pushed himself back and straight into my niece, startling her and bruising her knee. Parents were not around to tell these kids to behave, ride attendant did not say a word. OK, off the swings, to the playground.  More older kids (this place is geared to little ones, not teenagers) are all over the playground.  So much so my nieces, who LOVE to play with other kids and on playgrounds have gotten shoved around so much in this over crowded thing with kids 3x their size are just done after 10 minutes. Again, no parents around controlling their kids. All in all, we stayed less than an hour.  I took them to chick-fil-a where they could play, for free, on an age appropriate well maintained and relatively clean playground. Won't be going back to Jambo Park anytime soon!

This place was a total disappointment! A group of 10 of us went here for my birthday, the menu looked good and we were excited to try something new. We ordered quite a variety of things and no one really enjoyed any of it unfortunately. For apps we had the fried okra (I don't like okra to begin with so can't comment personally), the goat cheese and the potatoes. The goat geese app was pretty good, everything else was eh. For dinner I personally tried the risotto (had a very odd flavor) and the forbidden rice bowl (bland). Scallops were decent but nothing to write home about. I got the bread pudding for dessert - it was not like any bread pudding I've ever had before (and I don't mean that in a good way!). It tasted like slightly dried out spice cake sitting in a puddle of melted ice cream. My husband said even his cocktail was mediocre. All in all, "mediocre" sums up our experience and I personally, I would find somewhere else to eat dinner! There are too many other good restaurants to choose from!

I've been here quite a few times and we love the pizza! I feel like I can't give a completely well rounded review as the pizza is the only thing we have ever tried here. We always have the intention of trying some of their other dishes but the pizza always sounds so good and it has never disappointed. When we have gone with other people who have tried other things off the menu the reviews haven't all been great, thus the 4 stars instead of 5. The only other thing we have tried is the cauliflower appetizer. Doesn't sound too appealing, right? Cauliflower. Trust me, order it! Somehow the Parlor manages to take a fairly bland veggie and make it delicious. Overall, good atmosphere, good service, good pizza!

I love this place! It's close to my house, a great neighborhood hang out, good wine selection, good atmosphere, pretty good food, aaaaaaaand they allow dogs on the patio! What's not to love about all that? Service has always been good too. Fried pickles are delish. Bruschetta is pretty good, definitely not as good as Postino's but it's OK. We've tried quite a few other dishes here as well and everything has been enjoyable! Overall, a good experience every time and we will continue to go back!

I can not say enough wonderful things about Paws and about Tracy, the owner. I have been taking my two boxer boys, Oliver and Cooper, here forever and they LOVE it. Literally when they see where we are they dash inside and I have to drag them out at the end of the day. Tracy knows how to handle all of these different animals and there has never been a problem, even with my high energy dogs. We take them to day care regularly and this is where we board them if we go out of town. They always come home happy and exhausted. I love the report cards I get to let me know how they are doing, and Tracy is great about making sure they get meals and medications (if needed). Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!

I have been bringing both of my 2 year old boxers here from day one. I can't speak for all the veterinarians as I always go to Dr. Barnett, but I've got nothing but great things to say about him and the care he has provided to my dogs! The first thing he always does is get on the ground and play with the pups, which I love. He's attentive and listens to me when I'm describing any symptoms my dogs might have. We have found him to be super knowledgeable, honest, and personable and has yet to steer us wrong. The other staff we have encountered are all great as well, always friendly and helpful. They have also squeezed us in before when there have been some urgent situations.   We have our dogs on the wellness plan as its affordable and convenient. They always call to remind me when shots or exams are coming due, and the plan makes everything reasonably priced. Overall, I would definitely recommend Banfield, and Dr. Barnett in particular!!

I stopped into Meineke yesterday because my battery was obviously about to die. Now, I should start by saying I used to live right by this Meineke and in the past they have always done a great job at a fair price. Yesterday however, they told me that my battery was bad, and I needed to take it back to wherever it had been installed as it was still under warranty. I had had it installed THERE, a few years earlier, but for some reason they had no record of it. I was told that without proof of this, it would be over $230 for a new battery installation. I don't know a lot about cars but I DO know that is insanely high for a new battery for my 2002 Toyota. I took it over to Fletcher Tires and they got me a new battery in 15 minutes for $90 and they were absolutely as nice as could be. I was hesitant to write this review as I have had good service in the past. However the attitude the one gentleman had and the huge price difference really rubbed me the wrong way, so consider yourselves warned!

I've been here a few times, pizza is good, customer service is notoriously rocky at best. Tonight took the cake. I ordered a pizza - half pepperoni because thats the ONLY thing I like on my pizza, and my husband got sausage and olives on his half. They quoted me 30 minutes. 25 minutes later I walked in to get my pizza and the guy tells me he made a mistake and put the pizza in crooked (how does that happen?!) and all of the black olives are on the pepperoni side. Now, I used to wait tables and I know mistakes happen and I'm not one to get upset. BUT this guy tells me he can either give me $2 off, or I can wait another 30 minutes for another pizza. EXCUSE ME? I ordered a pizza and waited 30 minutes for it. You messed it up. And you offer me TWO DOLLARS off of a pizza I no longer want? Pizza Re, let me give you a free lesson in customer service. FREE, as in what the pizza should have been. A better choice might have been "I am so sorry we messed up your pizza. Can I either give it to you at no charge, or give you something to snack on while we quickly make you the one you ordered?" We live right near this place and enjoy the pizza. But the repeatedly bad customer service experiences have now outweighed the pizza, and we will not be back. Do yourself a favor Yelp users and go somewhere else for pizza, there are too many other good pizza places in town.

Fabio on Fire is AMAZING. I used him to cater my husbands surprise 40th birthday party at my home. Hiring him was a breeze - they were very easy to reach and quick to respond to my questions before I hired them and after. They showed up on time the day of the event, were incredibly courteous and friendly and the pizza was delicious! If you're looking for a fun way to serve delicious, authentically italian pizza, Fabio is your guy.
