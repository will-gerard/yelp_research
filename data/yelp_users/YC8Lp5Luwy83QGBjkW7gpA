if I could give a negative star this restaurant would have negative 5 stars. I like IHOP I usually find the service good and the food comforting.  This restaurant was horrible!!!!!  we showed up at 9 o'clock tonight and ask for a table. We had to wait more than 20 minutes to finally get seated. Our name was on the list and we were  supposed  to be first to be seated, but another family walked in and the person who was up front was going to seat them first.  If I  didn't speak up they would have sat before we did. So we finally got seated and then had to sit  for over 20 minutes  to get water. After 20 minutes I was fed up and I walked to the manager and told him that we have nobody helping us.  he came and got our drinks. He  took our order, but our food never came. What really annoyed me was that there were other waiters working on the table next to ours and two tables away and a waitress one table away who completely ignored our table. 25 minutes later we still did not have our food and the people who came in after us were eating theirs. I still did not know who our waiter or waitress was. Nobody came in to identify themselves and greet us like they normally do at other IHOPs. finally after waiting over an hour and still not having our food I went to talk to the manager but he was doing the cash register and so we just left. I have never been treated so horribly by anybody this restaurant does not have their act together the manager was nice but he does not have a staff that is people oriented. Would I go back here? that's really funny not on your life. I do want to mention that the woman's room was disgusting it was dirty and smelly and the trash was overflowing onto the floor. The restaurant was the same way when we showed up. There were five or six tables that had not been clean with dirty dishes on them.

We got here aroun 10am starving . This is a late breakfast for us.  Noticed that the line was out the door.  I was ready to turn around and leave, but I  am so glad we stayed. Your in line for about 5 minutes then you get to place your order. Nice menu with lots of choices. You can add or change what you want which is a plus (bagel instead of toast). The food came about 10 minutes later and OMG it was wondrful.!!!!!!!. Let's start with the coffee, best I  have had in a long time.  My apple chicken sausage scramble melted in my mouth.  My husband's omlett was so perfect .would we go back. How about tomorrow

This is our first time at Keegans. The place was extremely crowded at dinner time. All  the seats were taken on the patio and the dining room was pretty full. We were seated right away at a large booth next to window I'm very close to her special sign. Our waiter was Brian, who is very knowledgeable about the  menu and very helpful. Brian was very good at what he did filled our drinks again before they ran out and picked up the dirty plates right away. Keegan has a small menu but there's something for everyone. They have  burgers sandwiches, salad, steak, main entrees.  I

There is no one like Dr. Lewis Freed.  He is incredibly smart, kind, and he takes time with his  patients. Dr. Freed explains everything in laymen's terms. As a medical person, I really appreciate his dedication to his practice.

One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. Kona Grill has been around since the 1990s.  The first  restaurant was at Fashion Square where I had lunch there almost every day. Macadamia nuts chicken is to die.

Wonderful menu of different choices of food right here in the little town of Gilbert. Liberty Market gets crowed early but it's so worth the wait. We ate on the patio tonight surround by beautiful suculant plants.  Huge portions and a very attentive staff.  I can't wait to try Liberty Market for breakfast.

Newly decorated with a very romantic atmosphere Marcellos is known for their pasta. The wait staff has always been excellent, they know the dishes and can tell you how they are made and what is in the dishes.  They always have specials which changes every night.  The clam linguine with white sauce is to die for. My husband tries different dishes but unfortunately I get this every single time I come here. The average price is $17-$21

We use to love this place. Unfortunately  we now live about 60 miles away so coming here is only an option when we come back from up north.  Used to be Best Fajitas in town, sorry to say not anymore.  Today the shrimp was over cooked which really disappointed me.  I do have to say      The tortillas are made fresh when you order your meal. Piping hot and perfect. They never skimp on the meals. Large portions.  The wait staff are really friendly, fast to greet you at your table and they know the menu. Would I  come here again? I don't  thing so. They us to be the best , but I have had better closer  to home.

I have walked by this caf√© a thousand times the last few years and always seem to be too busy to stop in, what a mistake.  All the wonderful meals I could have had and yummy bakery.  Open for lunch this small  bright and airy bakery was crowded to the max.  When it was finally my turn to order the wait staff was charming. She helped me picked out a sandwich she thought I would like. And the sandwich was a delight.  Of course I had to get some cookies to take home but they never made it that far they were out of this world.  Would I go back? Of course!!!   I think I found another gem close by in my .

The only reason I am here is because my PCP joined this practice .  I love my doc, but the front office (3 women) ignored me while I stood there waiting to check in, so I 'm not sure I will be back. The waiting room is small with benches along the windows and lots of back to back chairs.  I have been itchy since I sat down.  My appointment was for 4 pm and I just found out at 4:15 that my doctor still has to see 3 patients ahead of me.  So far I'm not really impressed.  I love Dr. Izenberg but I not happy about this office,

One of our favorite places to go when we are in the area. Always very crowed especially on the weekends.  Wait staff has been excellent in the past, but today  we have sitting for over 10 minutes.   Our waiter finally arrived and apologized for making us wait. As usual our food was perfect. Get the bread, It's like heaven.  I love their Cobb salad with home made blue cheese dressing. The portions are always huge, I always have to take some home. I wish this restaurant would open other locations.  Their location at Power and McDowell is so far from me. Would I go back? any chance I can I eat here.

Wonderful food. Best chicken Parmesan and lasagna we have had in a long time.  The service was excellent.  This place is open 24 hours so after a night at the casinos you can come here and get a great meal.  During dinner hours I suggest a reservations.  We got here just before dinner and by the time we had our meals the place was packed with people waiting to get in.

My daughter found this restaurant by reading a review from Yelp.  We went here for dessert this evening after eating dinner at a different restaurant. You can gain weight just looking at the displays of yummy cakes cookies, tarts and candies.  I couldn't believe how big the dinner menu was. I know I will be back to try a real meal in the near future. Even though we had to wait about 10 minute because this place was packed it was worth the wait.

I have been to crackers and company over 17 times. The service is always outstanding especially Byron. He knows the menu and he tells you exactly what you need to know to make sure your meal is fabulous. The food is always prepared perfectly and I'm very very picky about my breakfast. I would recommend crackers and company to everyone. Would I come back here, of course it's my favorite place to go in the Mesa area for breakfast or lunch

One of the reasons we always come here, is that the food is fabulous and the waitstaff are wonderful. We love it when we get Warren to be our waiter.  Warren is very personable, he knows the menu very well, and aims to please.  I was a little disappointed in the person who sat us today. She is tall with white blond hair and was very standoffish.  I asked her If there were any booths. she said yes but none were available I said okay tables are fine but she didn't have any of those either and then we finally said  we would on the patio. She placed us at the first table she plopped down the menus and walked away to talk with her friends.  She didn't even ask if this table was okay.  Warren came right away and all my anger at the blonde lady went away.  Thank you Warren.

I have been going to Claim Jumper for probably over 10 years. I have known it  to have a warm and attractive atmosphere where the service is usually excellent and the food is always good. Claim Jumper is a wonderful place to sit and be able to talk to friends or family. There is no loud blaring music. Claim Jumper has  got a huge menu that you can make choices from and you are able to make substitutions to their menu. This visit was no different. I came here to meet my friend for dinner where we both needed to relax and just eat good food and talk. Claim Jumper always has a very attentive wait staff making sure we had everything we needed. I think it's funny that they always ask you if you want dessert considering their portions are huge. Would I come back here again yes yes yes.

Best corn beef in Arizona.  The menu is huge serving anything from omelets to pot roast. Huge mile high sandwiches and you can have half a sandwich or a mixture (one half corn beef the other half turkey). The wait staff at this location are usually college students who really go out of their way to make your visit a good one.  Meal are huge and come fast from the kitchen.  There is a very large bakery where you can get cookies, cakes , brownies and specialty breads. Would I come back here?  you bet I have been going to Chompie's for almost 30 years when it was a little restaurant  located on 40th street (I think) north of Shea.

Town Square is a really nice outdoor shopping experience. They have a park in the middle of the square for the kids to play in the water. Lots of specialty stores, restaurants and the usual stores you find at some of the Indoor malls.  I was there in July so I really wished they had more misters. They have a whole foods store which is a nice plus.  There is plenty of parking and lots to do.  I wished they had a book store since I love to wander among books but I still had a wonderful time.

I have been to Black Bear Dinner in Medford Oregon when I went there for business and I liked it very much. Today my husband and I went for dinner at the Gilbert location and the food was good but the service was horrible. I was very disappointed.  The hostess sat us in a booth pretty quickly and was very polite.  She told us that our waiter was Jimmy and that he would be there to help us in the next few minutes.  Twenty minutes rolled by and the hostess came by to find out if Jimmy had gotten our drink order.  I had seen 2 other waiters in the area where we were since we sat down but no Jimmy. The hostess got us our drinks or I should say mine since my husband ordered a beer and she told us she was underage and couldn't serve. Jimmy finally showed up about 10 minutes later and we told him my husband ordered a beer.  He took our dinner order and brought my salad out but no beer for my husband. We reminded him and he left again and we didn't see him for about 10 more minutes and finally brought my husband his beer.  I asked that on my ribs to have the barbecue sauce on the side and not to put any more sauce on the ribs, I don't always like some types of barbecue sauce and my ribs came with the sauce on the side, but also all over the ribs.  My baked potato came in tin foil and that is okay, but there was so much foil from cutting it in my potato that I had scooped half of my potato out.  Did you ever bite down on tin foil? Not fun!!  We only saw Jimmy two other times.   Once he did refill my drink without me asking for more But we had to ask other wait staff to help us with things that Jimmy didn't get for us.  So here is the kicker when we finally got our bill the second beer that my husband asked for 20 minutes before we got our bill never came and the beer was on the bill.  My husband mentioned that he never got his beer and Jimmy stated " I'm so confused tonight"  Would we go back? Maybe as long as we don't get Jimmy!!!!!!!

Nothing like Cracker Barrel. I haven't been here in a long time and I don't know why. I used to go to Cracker Barrel all the time when I lived in another state, but this is my first time to the one in Mesa.  You walk in through a fabulous old country store with old candies and clothing and all types of glassware's and pottery.  You can spend an hour just looking in the store.  Today I am having breakfast for lunch.  Okay they don't have eggs Benedict which is what I'm addicted to. Today I am going to try the pecan pancakes I'll let you know. OMG they are not skimpy with their pecans in the pancakes and the portion  size is huge.  The wait staff are courteous and very attentive. The facility is clean as in all the ones I've been to. Would I come back here again maybe  this Saturday.

I never had Vietnamese food before I really don't like spicy food but my husband and I decided to give it a try. Pho is located in the Home Depot shopping center around the corner from the big Home Depot chain.  It's  a small restaurant and at 8 p.m. on Friday night it was crowded to the max. we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a seat but it was so worth it.  We both had a rice dish.  Mine had pork, beef, egg, shrimp and vegetables. What made it delicious was the fish dressing you put over everything and mix it all together I could have that every night for dinner it was so good. I have to tell you the wait staff is excellent they have a good understanding of the menu and make good suggestions. They are very polite and attentive. Would we go back there again? You bet !

There must be something special to this place when a surgeon after seeing him tells you to go have something wonderful and be bad before I have surgery. This is my first time here and it's early so it's not crowded yet but it smells wonderful inside the diner room. I was seated right away and the waitress came and went over the menu with me she had a good knowledge of the menu which is nice. I have had English food in the pubs in London and all over England so we'll see how this meets English standards.  OMG my lunch was so good!!!!!!!.my pastry melted in my mouth.  It was filled to the brim with steak potatoes  and mushrooms.   Will i be back? yes,yes,yes

All I wanted was a good breakfast and a good cup of coffee. Breakfast very good, coffee not so much.  Started out with my creamer being expired and when I poured it into the coffee it clotted.  Easy fix, new cup of coffee and new creamer out of the fridge.  Okay let's talk about the coffee.  I found it very bitter. Not what expected so I didn't even take another gulp.  Why the 4 stars you ask?  Well I found the food very good. I had an omelet which was super large, filled with fresh ingredients. My husband's food was really good too.  I found the service to be excellent.  We were seated in about 10 minutes and our drinks were taken within 1-2 minutes after we sat down.  Our waitress was wonderful.  She took our order and checked back with us.   She was very nice, Would I go back?  already have.

We drive 11 miles each way to get the best Chinese food in the East Valley. The restaurant is small, clean, and the owners are polite and very helpful. The food is always fresh and The portions are large. We've always picked up our food and take it home because the restaurant is tiny. In the five or six times we've been there we've never had a bad meal. They have a large American menu or you can order off their Chinese menu with dishes that you've never heard of.  If there is a dish that you like offered spicy they can make it so it's not spicy for you. My husband and I have been to China and I can tell you this is the most original and most like real Chinese food that I've had in it since I've been living in Arizona.

Found in a little house on the corner of Sheridan + 7 Street. Parking lot outside with about 14 spaces. This restaurant is very bright and cheerful with lots of cool art on the walls and soothing  music playing in the background to make this experience relaxing  and very inviting.  The menu has a really good mixture of salads, sandwiches and specialty  foods.  Our waiter  JJ was very knowledgeable about the menu, and very helpful. Our food came hot and smelling delicious . my husband got the chili and I got the steak sub. My husband who is very critical about his chili said it was made to perfection. Okay my steak sandwich was not a Philly cheesesteak like you get in Philadelphia but it was still delicious. Would I go back to this restaurant you betcha. I did forget to mention that outside they have a perfect seating arrangement for sitting outside and enjoying  the Arizona weather. They are open Monday through Thursday till 11 p.m. . Friday and Saturday they are open till midnight. And on Sunday they close at 9.

If you work out of Maricopa you just don't want to make that drive back out to Chandler to find a good place to eat.  We found this place by accident and I am glad we did.  Nothing fancy, but that is one of the reason I love it here.  Good food, great atmosphere and really nice people who are waiting on you.  It was a Thursday night and yet the restaurant was packed.  I think we got the last table over by the pool tables.  The noise level was not bad.  Lots of conversations, but you could hear your own conversation and didn't have to yell over the noise in the restaurant.  The portions were big, and the food was good.  Would I go back.  Already have.

Ernie's is an old bar restaurant. Ernie's is owned by a family from Maryland. During the summer, they shipped in from Maryland Maryland blue crabs . If you want to get crabs you have to call on Wednesday and make a reservation otherwise they may not have any when you get here. Besides Maryland steam crabs, they have crab cakes and other Maryland items plus they have all types of food. unfortunately because of the distance we don't come here as often as I would like, but I always manage to come here on my birthday. The waitstaff is wonderful, funny, easy to talk to, and very prompt. When I come here again you bet I always come back.

We went to this restaurant because of the four-star rating. The first thing that I noticed when we walked in was a huge stain on the hostesses shirt. The restaurant to split into two sides.    Both sides have very old outdated booths and freestanding tables. The hostess wanted to seat us next to the door when you first walk in bad choice !!!!! First of all this is Mesa Arizona, every time that door opened 110 of heat came in. Not a good way to keep customers happy. We move to a booth where when I sat down there was basically no cushion. My bottom hits the hard flat surface that the cushion was supposed to protect you from. Our waitress was nice served us our coffee very fast but then decide to scream across the restaurant to tell a customer she had in the past about her masters degree she's getting over the Internet. The food was average, I really liked my coffee and my toast. My omelette was semi-warm.  my husband liked his breakfast, but he is a goat and will eat anything. I don't think we will be going back.

First time here. Cute little restaurant that smells really good when you walk in.   Clean in appearance. Tonight at 6pm there is only one waitress who is serving inside and outside.  She is also handling the take out orders.  She is attentive when you flag her down. The food was outstanding  and my portion was so big I  had to take some home.  I don't want  to say this restaurant was wonderful, because I'm afraid I won't be able to get a table next time we come back, but it was.  Only 4 stars because  they do need more wait staff.

Clean really cute decorations focused on the western theme with guns used as door knobs for the bathroom . Leather table tops with leather benches.  Big menus really cool items not found anywhere else . Wait service today was excellent right on top of everything and fast approach yet giving us take time to figure out what we want.   We don't have our food yet, but what I have seen looks wonderful. Huge portion.

The brush bar is so much fun. I went there with my girlfriend to paint a rooster. Never been to a place like this, so I did not think I could do it. I had a blast!  The artists are all young and so much fun they make learning easy. One of the artists stands in front of the class and step-by-step shows you how to draw what you need to draw.  By the  end of the class everyone has a rooster all different but all really good.  Would I go back, you bet as soon as I can I think this place is wonderful.

My daughter found this place and even though it is far from where I live I would come here over and over again. The moist brisket is the best I've had since New York City. You order at the counter and then you sit on huge picnic tables inside and outside it's fast it's delicious and I highly recommend this restaurant.

Sarah Neumann has won the award for the best physicians assistant in 2012. Her office and practice have also won the best dermatology practice in 2012.  I have known Sarah for over 15 years .She's  is so knowledgeable about her practice .  Sarah is very compassionate about making sure that her patients understand how to take care of themselves.  She spends a lot of time with her patients.  I am so blessed that when I made an appointment so many years ago the doc couldn't see me, and I got to see Sarah.  I live on the other side of the valley, but will follow her where she goes.

First time here.  I found the decor relaxing and comfortable.  I saw in a past review that service was a problem. Not the experience I had. I was seated right away and given the choice of a table or a booth. My waiter was at my table within 2 or 3 minutes and answered all my questions. He was polite and make sure I had everything I needed to have a successful meal. I just was craving a burger so I ordered one med rare.  It came out almost perfect.  a little darker then I like but was still good.  They had on 60-70 music which for an oldie like me I was humming to when I was eating.  I really enjoyed my lunch here.  Would I go back?  Why not I had a good meal with good service.

This post office in Mesa Arizona has the slowest working people in the United States. Not only do they only have one or two clerks out at one time but it seems like they always take a break for 20 minutes. When one worker comes back two workers go off to break. The other post offices in Mesa have workers who really seem to care about their jobs. They are efficient ,helpful, and speedy. At this post office they are slow,wander around with blank looks,and don't really care.  I spent 45 minutes in line with three people ahead of me 45 minutes is ridiculous.

This was my first time here and found my experience to be delightful. The restaurant is beautifully decorated big area and bright. We were greeted appropriately and taken to our seats right away. Our waitress came within a minute to offer us drinks. She was very nice and knew the menu. As always I like to ask questions just to see how much they know. I got the crab encrusted salmon which was light and delicious. The portions are good. The only thing I did not like, was that we were sitting right next to where the waiters pick up the food.  Everyone     all the waiters and waitresses were standing there whether they had to work to do or not. Some were working hard others were standing around talking and sitting so close to that area they were not talking work. Would  I go back? Of course the food was really good and the atmosphere was  calming and relaxing.

Came here for breakfast found the dining room small but clean with wonderful smell of baked goods. Wait staff was very friendly and personable and came to our table within two minutes.  Portions were big. I couldn't finish my meal.  I didn't like the potatoes much, but my eggs were good.  My husband loved his omelet.  We took one of the heath bar brownies home and it was huge and wonderful.  Would I  eat here again yes sir.

This location in Mesa off of Main Street is not a store, but a place to pick up your purchases from their massive Scrapbook website. The wonderful thing about it is if you live in Mesa you don't have to pay for shipping. Www.Scrapbook.com is most likely the best scrapbooking website on the Internet at this time. Not only do they have huge amount of products, but they have huge gallery to get ideas from. They also have YouTube videos for how to use their products and create wonderful pages. When you pick up your items, you always get a free product. The staff at the Main Street pick up site are always friendly and outgoing and you get your order within minutes of arriving there.  I will always be loyal to scrapbooking.com, because they treat their customers with respect and have great products.

Wow, . Eat one of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever had on that price level. The average sandwich which is huge costs between seven dollars and $10.  You walk in and there is a very very large board on the wall of every type of sandwich you can think of even vegetarian. If you don't see anything you want, they can make you what you want. The service staff are friendly and helpful and actually funny. The restaurant is clean and attractive and definitely for groups and families. But here's the deal the sandwiches are delicious the bread they use is different and they're very filling.  Ikes is located on the east side Alma School, south of Southern, across from Fiesta Mall. You will not be disappointed.

This is my first time to this restaurant which was recommended to me by some friends. Cheddar's is very large with many seating areas including one outside. Nicely decorated, with  booths throughout. A huge saltwater tank and Polynesian style fans in the main dinning room.Very crowed for a Thursday night. Lots of noise. You can easily hear all the gossip that your neighbor is talking about. The waitstaff was very attentive and at my table minutes after I  sat down. The food was really good. My husband and I really enjoyed  our meal.  It was filling and a relaxing  night.  Would we go back?  We already have.

So I was cruising around today trying to find a place to eat lunch before a doctor's appointment when I drove past Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles. I have never eaten here before so I did a u turn and pull into the parking lot. When I walked into this brightly lite restaurant I was greeted right away by the hostess who took me to a booth.  Aaron my waiter showed up within a few minutes and took my drink request. I was going to get chicken until I saw someone else get the French toast.  My order came really fast. I like the fact that you can get breakfast anytime of the day. OMG my french toast melted in my mouth!!!!! Aaron was very attentive and checked up on me a lot. Other wait staff also asked if I needed anything,( a sign of good training. ) Would I come back here again? Yes,yes and yes

While wandering around downtown Chandler with my husband, we found this charming little place. It is very little on the inside but they do have tables on the outside where you can sit and enjoy your meal. This restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch but it is without a doubt a place I'll be coming back to many times in the near future. We are breakfast snobs and really do enjoy a good breakfast. My husband had the Mediterranean omelette and he says the ingredients were very fresh and tasty. I have the banana and walnut pancakes which were so good I would go back for more if I wasn't stuffed. The portions are good and the wait staff are very nice and helpful. if you want to go to a relaxing breakfast or lunch and just enjoy Downtown Chandler this is the place to go.

Brand new and just opened up about a week ago this huge restaurant has a very organized and large menu.  They have listed appetizers, soups and salads, pizza, burgers, sandwiches and specialties.  I got here at 4:15 and the restaurant which looked empty filled up in about 15 minutes. I did find a table in the back where four of my friends are going to meet me for dinner.  The wait staff so far has been very polite and fast with drinks. When everyone arrived there were 8 of us so the staff moved us to a high top table without any problems.  The food was very good, and the portions were big. Everyone I was with thought the food was really good. It was very noisy here but it is a pub not church.  I thought for only being open for a few days that they did a really good job.  I did read some of the other reviews and could not believe how unforgiving some people are.  Hey world this place is brand new.  The staff is mostly new.  Give them a break.  Would I go back here again?  Of course, next time I am going to try the salad with goat cheese.
