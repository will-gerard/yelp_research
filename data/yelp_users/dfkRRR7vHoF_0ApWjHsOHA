3.5 stars but I'll round up to a 4.  We had great service here:)  Waitress was super nice and brought me a tomato juice even though that one is usually served at breakfast and lunch only.  I really don't think I eat my worth at buffets.  Came here with the group of friends so we can all eat together.  At $43 a person, there is definitely plenty of food for meat lovers, sushi lovers, pasta lovers and vegetarians alike.  It's nice that they offer vegan and gluten free versions of some dishes but definitely not enough.    A few goodies at the buffet: salmon hand rolls, pesto pasta, prime rib.  Those were my favorites.  Everything else was just average.  Cheese selection was rather pathetic.  Dessert: the lemon tart was good but again, everything tastes mass produced.  As far as buffets go, this place is probably better than the rest.  But I'd rather have quality over quantity these days.

Punk rockers, grunge clothing and dive bars are usually not my thing.  I like clean bathrooms and nonsticky counters.  But this one is cool in my book.  I vibe the cool art on the wall with the animals in human clothing, so fun.  Being that it was a Sunday night and we just wanted an intimate and low key place, this place came up on the Yelp search.  They have a cool screen that displays all their beers on tap, which is about 30.  I tried the Nitro Milk Stout by Lefthand Brewing Co and it is seriously the best, most creamy and delicious stout I've ever had.  So good that my babe bought me a second one while I let him hit on me like we were strangers.  Don't ask, we are weird like that:)  I'm usually not a stout girl but that beer changed my life that evening.  And you know I am not even a beer drinker.

I absolutely love the sandwiches here!!!  I wouldn't have known about it if my awesome Yelp Elite friend Shanon Y didn't alert me of this awesome place when we met up in Vegas.  Next to PF Chang's, this sandwich shop is definitely the Earl of sandwiches.  The bread is warm, chewy, perfect in texture and they have a variety of choices!  Per Shanon's suggestions, we got the original (roast beef) and chipotle avocado chicken.  At $6.49 a piece, you can't beat the price and the quality of the sandwiches here!  We actually went back later and got a salad but it was nothing special.  More like the kind of you get in grocery stores when the lettuce is very dry and tasteless, so avoid the salads.  We went back again before our flight took off and got the Holiday Turkey and Tuna Melt to take with us on the plane as our evening meal.  Even though they cooled down by the time we boarded, both were still unbelievably tasty!    If you are on the Vegas strip and looking for a cheap meal that still tastes good, come here!  They have lots of seating available and open 24 hours!  The only thing is that I wish they offered a vegan option, I think that would make me give them a million stars!

Oh Palazzo, you romance with me your beautiful high ceilings, large spacious and modern rooms and a lavish pool to top it off.    A group of us booked 2 suites here for Halloween celebration last weekend. The rooms were definitely spacious, and can hold up to 6 people per room if you get the Bella Queens (2 queens plus a pullout couch bed).  The rooms here are twice as spacious as other hotels, about 970 sq feet.  The decor is modern, clean, luxurious.  I felt like such a princess staying here.  I heard about tipping to get an upgrade and when I was checking in, I held a $20 bill in front of my credit card at the desk.  I asked about any possible upgrades and she said they were $45 per room (we had 2 rooms).  Then she said, oh, I'll upgrade you to strip view.  When I asked if there is an extra charge, she said no, with a smile.  I slipped her the $20 and she said thank you and put it under her keyboard.  Score!  Our view on the 21st floor was breath-taking.  I loved that we got connecting rooms for $11.20 more.  I think it's a bit ridiculous to charge a connecting room guarantee fee but since we got upgraded for such a little amount, I am not complaining.  It amazes me that this hotel is so well ventilated that I didn't smell any smoke unless I was down in the casino floors.  I also love it's so close to the Wynn since that's one of my favorite hotels in Vegas because of how beautiful it is.  I'd love to come back and stay a few more nights next time.

Cheap yes, good, no.  The flour tortilla was dry and hard, the meat was overcooked in the carne asada burrito and the rice and beans were soggy and gross.  I felt sick after eating here and I only obliged because J said he wants to relive his college days where he'd eat there all the time.    Thankfully I didn't die.  Felt like it for a few hours afterwards though.  Come here at your own risk.

Surrender takes me back to partying in my 20s: a little bit crazy, a little bit hazy and a whole lotta fun!  We got bottle service for weekend prior to Halloween.  I didn't actually go in for 2 hours because a friend got a bit too tipsy before we stepped in so we had to make sure she was ok before stepping back this way.  It's spacious, good music and we had nice comfy lounge couches to sit on.    minus 1 star for the Vodka seeming diluted.  I'm a light weight drinker and after 3 drinks and not much of a buzz?  Grey Goose, I know you are stronger than that.    Alcohol aside, I love that it is connected to the pool area and you can step out for some fresh air at your leisure.  I had a great time dancing and spending time with my friends.  Stumbling out around 2am was a good time for me as I rarely stay up past midnight anymore.  At least it's just a hop and skip away from our rooms at the Palazzo.   For 2 bottles of diluted Vodka totalling in $650 for the table.  I'd say nay for bottle service.  I think partying here on a regular night could be just as much fun.

Terribly slow service.  Took us 15 mins to order and the waitresses here look like they'd rather go swim in the sewer than serve customers.  My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger with fries and told them we only had 20 mins before boarding.  The waitress looked at us as if we were dead rats and walked away.  15 minutes pass by and we keep on seeing a burger sitting at the counter but the waitress just ignored it.  We asked if that was our burger and she goes, "NO", but then we saw her pack it into our to-go box which we had to get because she let the burger sit there for 10 minutes instead of bringing it to us and we ran out of time to eat.  To make matters worse, they gave us onion rings instead of fries.  My honey wanted to share the fries with me and because I'm allergic to onions, he wasn't able do that now.  He told me the burger was worse than ones he would get at McDonalds, dry and cold.   AVOID this place at all costs!!!!!

If this place was in the Bay Area, you bet I'd be going regularly.  A tiny little place with mostly seats around the bar in a U shape and 1 bartender/host, it is definitely a cozy place.  They have everything good in my book: decent wine selection, great beer selection, lots of board games, reasonable pricing, fun chalk art on the wall and cute trinkets all over the place.  Our bartender was really cool and gave excellent suggestions for IPAs because that's what my BF loves to drink.  I've been getting into beer a little more recently and loved each of the beer he suggested.  Hop Juice was one of the best ones and he also poured me a strawberry cider that was super delicious without being too sweet.  You can tell regulars frequent this place as the bartender/host/partial owner chats up with each of his patrons in a relaxed, friendly way.  We played Connect Four like champs and had way too much fun.  We were going to bar hop that night but this place was so great that we ended up staying until past 2am.  Even though the bar closed at 2am, our bartender was super chill and just let everyone hang out without rushing people out the door.  Man, I love this place.

Was in town for a visit and signed up for class and because I was the only one that came they cancelled the class.  I was there 15 mins early, they checked me in. Didn't start the class on time and then as I sat there waiting the Instructor, who was nice but said sorry the owner won't let anyone take class if they are the only person there. I had my bf drive 20 mins to this class to drop me off and then had to wait for him to drive back and pick me up. All the while the instructor was sitting at the front desk. She could be teaching the class but I guess the Owner won't let her. I don't see this policy anywhere on their website. Per the instructor, that's just the owner's rule, no real reason. Really disappointed. I had skipped on taking another class to try this one and now I missed that studio's class.  Not a great way for a new studio to run their business.

You may limit the spots you open to Classpass members but in my opinion, Classpass members are paying customers too and pay a membership fee and should not be treated differently than regular members.  I have received an email from your studio in saying that when a Classpass member comes, your studio only gets a portion of the regular rate you charge a client and that is why you would cancel the class even if the client is there if they are a Classpass member.  To me that is bad practice because there is a difference in treatment.  As a business, you know what you are getting in repayment when you partner with Classpass.  And as far as I know, it is a way to attract new clients to sign up with your studio outside of Classpass if they decide to take more than 3 classes a month.  Any studio that turns away a client that is already there and waiting is a studio that needs to revisit their policy, period.
