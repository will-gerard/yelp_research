Dr Austin is incredibly thorough with pt and family history. She personally spent a lot of time with me. Dr. Austin has awesome bedside manners and is very personable. This is a small well run office. Staff is also personable. Dr. Austin is a stellar example of a great doctor. I can't imagine that a patient would be turned away if they showed up in need without an appointment.

I enjoyed shopping here because everyone knew what  they were doing and could help you with anything. Now its like Home Depot! The customer knows more than the employee. I've shopped here several times too many. I'm done!

It doesn't matter which doughnut(s) you choose, they are all incredible. There is no comparison. Rainbow doughnuts are addicting.

I read a review of how great they were. I took my truck there. EEKS, me thinks never again! I had an 8 am appointment for an oil change and head light problem. I waited for 2 hours and they didn't address the initial problem (the head light) until I reminded them at the time of payment. I clearly explained that I received a citation for having a head light out and I needed that looked at first. They reconnected the wire that had shaken loose and were shady in writing it on the receipt. I asked the guy to clarify on the receipt what was done and he blew me off by saying, we didn't do a repair. He refused to make that clarification on the receipt. This caused a problem when I went to the Paradise Valley court to prove I had the head light problem corrected. They are extremely overpriced and don't care about the customer.

These people open their hearts and welcome everyone. Your not just tolerated, you are accepted and loved. They don't shove religion down your throat. They teach love!   They are Science of Mind, not not not Scientology. Not anything like it!   If you are lookinng for an up beat spiritual experience, go there.   I am so happy to have found CLF.

Drove by many times and decided to stop today, so glad I did. Ordered a hot roast beef sub with Swiss cheese. It was awesome! Awesome! They use real roast beef, eyes big with pleasant surprise. I'll certainly go back to try other items on the menu. It's a small place and not a chain. I like that! No alcohol served and that's OK with me. Hours are Mon.-Sat. 11a-9p. Subs are $7.00 & change; pizza starts at $11.50. Employee's work well together, nice to see. I sat waiting on my order and watched the cashier carry an order out to another customers car. HUH??? Yippee for Stumpy's, you rock.

Where did the roast beef go? The roast beef last time tasted like it came from Subway. Gross!!  I used to love the hot roast beef sub.   I asked the guy to tunnel the bread, he didn't.   Excess lettuce and bread.   Employees lack personality.

Let me just say, don't waste your time going elsewhere. I especially enjoy sausage, pepperoni with fresh basil.

Hap's is a happening bbq place. The pulled pork sandwich is OMGosh darn great! The smoked chicken salad is, I crave it, good. Some day I'll try something else but I just love the pulled pork sandwich or the smoked chicken salad. Hap's is always way busy at lunch time. You order at the counter and pick up your food yourself. The employees are very accomodating and polite.You'll understand once you give them a try. Parking is a bit of a problem but there is street parking as well. It's a bit of a drive for me, but well worth the drive. It is close to GateWay Community College and Sky Harbor airport. They offer a catering service which is a plus in my book.

I'm sold! The price is one that you can't beat. Regular prices are 3 bucks and Tuesdays are $1.50. The pop corn was good (no butter) and the soda, well, it is a fountain drink. It's a different kind of setting. You walk through a twilight tunnel to get to the movie  entrances. Pretty cool!

Horrible service!!! I had to WAIT...when there only were two people ahead of me. Got my food, went home and was shorted 2 items. I called & the guy said he could give me 2 extra biscuits and a family size okra. REALLY??? for wasting my time and gasoline. REALLY??? I did go back the next day and...WAITED & WAITED. This is the crappiest service ever! I occasionally enjoy the food but I will definitely check my order before I leave, IF I go back to that location. These employees have no sense of priority, BIG PERIOD.

I've wanted to try this place for some time. I purchased a groupon so off I went with my group of friends. We were there for happy hour. What a deal! We started with appetizers, guacammus, lettuce wraps & fresh chips and salsa, All was yummy! We ordered a picture of Peach Sangria. It was refreshing, light and flavorful but the canned fruit was in poor taste. On to the meal. Everyone said the food was incredible. I totally enjoyed the Coconut Curry Rice. YUMMY! I took half of it home.   The waitress was very attentive. polite and fun. Kudos!! I bet she enjoyed her nice tip.  Delayed review as my first visit was in August. Happy hour, well...we left happy!  Here it is Oct and I returned with a friend for weekend brunch. DISAPPOINTED!!! I had the Latin Egg  Fritatta. Key word: EGG. It was pretty much all egg with a minute hint of peppers, cheese and sausage. Very unsatisfying! I must say that the peach sangria was still...well... I left happy again even though it wasn't happy hour. Will not return for weekend brunch.   The waiter was not attentive at all. Maybe he doesn't enjoy people? I didn't enjoy his lack of service. HINT: good service=good tip. Server decides!

I haven't ever ordered anything that wasn't good to the taste buds. The food is always displayed nicely on the plate. It's nice to have a choice of inside or outside dining. The drinks are good, full flavor and not watered down. It is a good environment if you want to have a conversation with someone, unless it is happy hour. The service is sometimes a bit slow and not so friendly (servers personal prejudice may play into that). Some servers have a beautiful sense of humor, which I enjoy. It is always very clean and appealing to the eye. The location is perfect, on Central between Northern and Dunlap. They are part of the Groupon deal which really reels me in.

I love shopping at Kohl's. Very good clothing quality and excellent bargains. I don't recall ever having a bad shopping experience and I've never had a bad experience with returns. I just wish the jeans selection were more broad. Recently I bought a dress that was originally priced @ $80.00 for a fantastic sale price of $18.00. I would prefer getting my discount (Kohl's cash) at the time of purchase rather than having to go back.

My dentist, Dr. Grubler, retired but not before teaming with Biltmore Commons Dental Care. The staff is friendly and helpful. Dr. Balestrino is very personable, thorough and has a great sense of humor. He listens and discusses the patients plan of care. The hygienist did a fantastic job on my cleaning. The office technology is up to date, all digital. At this point I am totally impressed!

I didn't realize this is the original Mel's Diner from Alice,the TV show. Good food, excellent service, good prices. The neighborhood is a bit less than elegant but so what. I enjoyed my breakfast experience at Mel's.

I tried this place tonight after hearing how great the food is. I had fried catfish (awesome, awesome), fresh fried okra ( yes, it was fresh not frozen) black eyed peas (kinda blah), mixed greens (flavor wasn't great), corn bread and sweet tea. The tea tasted like my mom's. This is kind of a country hick place. Nothing fancy, far from it. Dingy and dirty; hasn't been cleaned in haw many years? There are a lot of autographs from famous people and athletes on the walls. The server (a nice young lady) was also the cook. If you are looking for ambiance this is not the place to go. If you are looking for good food, go to Mrs. Whites. There are no prices listed and I was a bit surprised at our bill. 2 dinners and 1 glass of tea and 1 glass of koolade (? spelling) $34.00 No breakdown of charges. All dinners are $15.00

Love Costco!!! I really like the low prices and the great quality. The return policy is unbelievable. Even if you don't have a receipt, they look it up with your Costco ID. I haven't ever had a problem with returning something. I have been in the returns line and wondered why in the world they were allowing someone to return something as the person clearly abused the return policy.  I've used the optical dept and was very pleased. I didn't realize my vision was so poor. Thank you for the great care and service. I will always be a Costco customer because I know they stand behind their word. Costco is all about customer service and I'm sold on that.

The staff is always so friendly. My order is always prepared in a timely manner. The salads are yummy. I tried the roast beef, ummm not again. It tasted like processed meat. Good variety of cold beer for the hot summer days. The atmosphere is rather quaint. There was a musician singing and playing his guitar during lunch last week.

AWESOME catfish nuggets. This is a small family owned and run business. The menu is on the board that hangs on the wall, They offer specials of the day, quaint. Papa Joe's is now a favorite of mine.

And oh my lordy, they have good hush puppies. Ohhhhh I'm so sorry I've driven by this place for years and didn't give them a try. OK I've eaten here many times and it seems to get worse. I don't go there anymore as the last time was awful. Okra, greasy and too spicy. Mac & cheese was overcooked and the catfish was too spicy. I didn't order spicy.

The last time I went there, and it is the last time, the food was not good at all. overcooked and the spice hand fell hard on the okra and catfish. I ordered no spice and got lots of spice. After I paid for my order, which was an order for 3 people, the owner said to me, my wife didn't charge you for some stuff. I've told her to write so I can read it. OK, rude! Suck it up and deal with your wife. I used to go there a lot and have sent a lot of business there but I feel that this is a business that has plummeted to poor, very poor in service and quality.  I have found MUCH BETTER downtown.

After a Sun Devil brake job, I drove on bad brakes for 6 months. Sun Devil Auto replaced my brake pads, Sept. 2009. Immediately following I began having problems, horrible metal scraping noise, brakes grabbing & squeaking. I brought this to George's attention 5 times by 5/19/10.Finally, I had an appointment to have my brakes checked. A half hour before the appt., George called & wanted to keep my truck saying it may be the hydraulics. When the call ended I drove my truck to Jack's Brake & Alignment. He told me what was wrong. The installed brake pads were not working on my truck. I drove back to Sun Devil for them to do the work. George ordered the needed parts & I scheduled an appt for the following week. I was told I would be in & out in a jiffy. THREE HOURS later & after listening to a service person's bad language, F word a number of times, my truck was done & I was done with Sun Devil Auto. They gave me coupons for two free oil changes. I'll start my fire pit with them. I called the corporate office, lo and behold, I got lip service, smoke up the back side & a $50.00 credit. Wouldn't ever trust them with my automobile again.George learned lip service well! This was my experience. After the fact, I asked around and found a lot of complaints. George always greets with a big smile to charm. My experience, his charm is a diversion to do crappy service. After reading other reviews, now I understand more about the CHEAP price for the oil changes.

They are HORRIBLE!!!!!! They did a brake job on my truck. There was a problem immediately. Within a 6 month period I brought the grinding and scraping noise to their attention 6 times. They did nothing! I took my truck to Jack's Brake and Alignment for a diagnosis. It was explained what needed to be done. I returned to Sun Devil explained where I had gone and what was recommended. They did follow the recommendation and I was OUT OF THERE AND NEVER TO RETURN. I called corporate; they don't care either!

The food is OK. Nothing to write home to mom about. After the server realized that part of my friends order hadn't been served we had to remind once again, while the food was getting cold, to bring the rest of the order. I ordered the country skillet. It was pretty bland. The sausage gravy should be renamed to milk gravy due to the lack of sausage. Another of our party ordered the "special", steak and eggs with the steak order rare. His meal was served with well done steak so it was sent back. he received his meal once again but the rest of our party was pretty much finished with their meal. The coffee cups were refilled regularly. Our party of 12 was taken for breakfast without reservation and within the half hour of our phone call. Breakfast pricing was under $10.00. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner menu but breakfast is just OK.

This is the second time Ive used Safelite. I am thrilled with customer service. The windshield was replaced and looks very good. The tech was very polite and professional. While replacing the windshield he dropped something on my hood and the clear-coat is gone in a two inch radius. I called Safelite and I heard a very sincere apology and an immediate effort to fix the problem. No questions, no hassles. Safelite is paying to have the hood of my truck fixed and providing me with a rental car while the work on my truck is being done. KUDOS to you Safelite. Thank you!! Thank you!!

I've been to 13 North a few times at various meal times. I have never been disappointed in the food which is excellent (sweet potato fries are out of this world good) or the service. There is one TV in the bar area and that personally works for me. The staff has always been very personable and keeps a good eye on my table. I never have to ask for anything.   Awesome job!  Count me in as a regular.

This is the first time I've been dissapointed with the food. I had Salmon with spicy Asian sauce. The sauce smothered the Salmon flavor. I couldn't even tell what I was eating.   My friend had the Prime Dip. It was more bread than anything. Not kosher!   The server was very good. He was pleasant, checked on us many times. He has a laugh you can't forget.   Whatever changed, please change it back.

After receiving a $800.00 estimate from another vet for a cleaning and extraction of one tooth, I took my adult cat to Catalina. I was told by a co-worker that this place is OK for that but for anything serious, go elsewhere. I went with an open mind. I walked in and the place smelled like a dog kennel. YUK!! I mean The smell make me feel like I was walking through the pound looking for a dog. The service was a bit less than professional. They wanted no history about my cat...none. My cat has never hissed or misbehaved when I picked him up from his DR. visit. My cat was completely pissed off and snarled and hissed at everyone who tried to remove him from the kennel.  I was told the dental exam, cleaning and polishing would be $175.00 and it was. The antibiotic was an additional $25.00. I was told that no teeth needed to be pulled. Time will tell! I'm not impressed at all with this vet. I will continue my search for a good vet that doesn't want me to pay for the Mercedes and the house.

I searched coffee and found this gem. What a delightful little shop. Fresh homemade chocolates, fresh everything. I was so pleased with everything. The prices are more than reasonable. The owners are present, they actually work there. Very pleasant folks! I highly recommend Rayner's.

A friend suggested we go there for breakfast. I'm so glad she did. Excellent food! Good prices and friendly staff. I chatted with the owners who also work there. Really fine people.   I had the vegetable omelet, fresh "farm style?" potato's (nicely seasoned), homemade biscuit which was scrumptious and I chose water to drink. My friend swears awesome good things about the coffee.   Consider me a happy regular.

I took my car there for body work. I got it back while driving home I tried to adjust the mirror on the passenger side. It no longer worked. Called them, took the car back, mirror adjustment worked. Jerky but it worked. Drove the car home, parked in the driveway and the next morning there's a lot of oil on the driveway under my car. Called them, took the car back and was told,  "We didn't do anything to your car". Too strange!! It's  a 2004 but still... I didn't have oil draining like that until ABC worked on my car. They are totally not accepting responsibility. Never never again will I take any automobile to ABC collision.  5/20/16, I'm at AAA because of the oil hemmorage. I've put 5 quarts of oil in my car in 3 days. There are 2 holes in the oil filter. ABC Collision will here from me on this one!!!

Always the best pizza, hands down! Get your pizza with fresh basil. It is ummmm ummm melt in your mouth scrumptious.  Calzones are dough overload.  Can't say anything about service, I do takeout.

This is the most awesome practical transportation service!  A friend left me stranded at the airport. Uber became my transportation best friend. I got a trip estimate, made my arrangements on the internet, immediately got a call from my driver, and he arrived to pick me up within 5 minutes. Don't make the arrangements until you are ready to be picked up. They are fast!!!!  I also watched his route to my pick up point on the apps map. The driver was awesome and the complete experience was amazingly comfortable. I give UBER 10 plus.  Don't waste your money or time on frustrating taxi's any longer. Uber beats the taxi prices hands down!
