Korey was an awesome bartender. He was so friendly, fun and knowledgeable. Food was great, try the shrimp taquitos. Can't wait to go back for the fresh lobsters and oyster bar. They also have a great assortment of cocktails!

If I could rate this place a 0 I would. I brought in three items a week ago, something to be cleaned, shorts to have a zipper replace and a dress to have hemmed 1 inch. When I picked it up a week later I was told I needed to pay an additional $10 for my dress to be hemmed (on top of the $15 I already prepaid). I told them it was overpriced for what I was asking to be done. To make matters worse, my dress was not even there to take home!!! I couldn't pick it up for another two days. I'm furious. I will never return.

I would give this place no stars if possible. Extremely slow, we waited over an hour to be seen. The office seemed disorganized. I would not recommend anyone to come here.
