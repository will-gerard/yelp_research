I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:  1. My car was broken into! This is a "gated" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time! 2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought, with little to no urgency. When asking about a piece of mail that was delivered to the office, they seemed to have no idea where it could have gone and keep no log of incoming or outgoing mail. On top of that, they didn't care enough to find the mail! 3. Grounds are kept at a minimum. Dog bags are refilled occasionally, bushes are cut haphazardly. Overall, just unkempt.  I'd say stay away from this place!!

BEAUTIFUL! Phoenix doesn't get much more amazing then when you're looking down at her from Dobbins Lookout.  A few tips: 1. Get there before 6pm. The park closes the entry but if you're in, you can stay as long as you want.  2. Be ready for a drive up a mountain -- scary cliffs and tight corners. Make sure you go slow, watch for hikers and cyclists, and overall be cautious. 3. If you're heading to the summit for the views (Dobbins Lookout) bring a jacket or blanket. It's cold and windy when the sun goes down, even in the summer.  There are bathrooms but no water fountains at the Lookout.

Overall this is a great sushi joint. Fresh, clean, and service is awesome. The prices are a little high but it's worth it.

Super awesome fun! I can't wait to go back!  A few suggestions before you take the trip to go shoot some guns: 1. Consider a membership. Wait times were almost two hours. Yes, it was a Saturday afternoon but they only have 11 lanes. If you're a member, you can call and register a lane at a certain time. THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY ALONE, especially if you're considering going back again. Plus if you're in the market to purchase a gun, a membership will also give you a great discount. 2. You can try out a few guns, as the rental is not per hour. Ty out that Glock .23 and don't like it? Simply trade it for another and keep on shooting. 3. Bring a jacket if you're going to stay on lane 10 or 11. DIrectly under a vent, it can get a little cold in the corner.  Definitely worth the trip -- so fun! I can't wait to go back again.

While I decided to not get work done to my car, I can say that I would trust aamco to service my needs for my car in the future.   Patrick took the time to walk me through the diagnostics of my vehicle. He was informative, respectful, and honest. If something was not worth repairing (which was the case for me), he told me! Instead of trying to milk money from me, he was upfront in weighing the value of the work needing done to my car. He even let my car stay on their lot for an entire week without charging me as I decided what I wanted to do.  Although aamco is typically pricier than the other shops in Tempe, they guarantee their work. That's worth the extra $100 you'll spend here!   Go here and know that your car is in good hands.

Love this dive bar! Great service, lots of drink specials, and a very fun atmosphere. My favorite thing to do is play darts but they also have a shuffle board and a pool table.  This isn't the place to come if you're looking for great food or lots of televisions to watch all the games.

I've been going to Vien for quite some time and it's the best place for a pedicure in northern Phoenix.  The staff is quiet, respectful, and clean. They have a TON of colors to choose from and will do designs and details for a minimal cost. They are professional, and their massage chairs work wonders to relax me.  They do a great job on the pedicures by massaging your feet and legs. I always come out of there feeling rejuvenated and relaxed - plus my pedicure lasts up to three weeks!  It's not the "fanciest" place to go to, but you get more than you pay for (and it's worth it!).

Maybe it's because this location is on Mill Avenue, but I've had better. The sushi is average, the prices are higher than normal, and the service is poor.  We called ahead to schedule a larger group and the hostess told us she "didn't accept reservations" but that she'd consider it. Ummmm, okay? When we arrived, we still had to wait 20+ minutes for them to prepare the table. Drinks were slow to arrive and poor lighting outside made it awkward to order.  When the food arrived, it was simply lacking. For an upscale sushi joint, I expected to be blown away -- I was far from impressed.  When we were ready to leave, it took 25 minutes for the waiter to bring our check. TWENTY FIVE! A man in our party finally had to hunt him down in order for us to pay and leave.  All in all, I won't return.

Great place with a cool college vibe. The rolls are unique to the community and the service is awesome!  $1.50 beers during happy hour!

I can't believe I haven't tried a Pita Jungle sooner and I can't wait to go back!  The atmosphere was fantastic. Sprinkled with local art on the wall, the place was bright and welcoming. The restaurant was clean, neatly laid out, and fresh.  The food was AMAZING! Is there another word for amazing? Because that doesn't do it justice. Unbelievable, hit the spot, fresh, super, fantastic. I ordered the honey glazed chicken pizza and will never think of another pizza the same way.  The value was great. For $22, we had an excellent meal with great service in a wonderful location.  GO TO PITA JUNGLE! You won't regret it.

You'd miss Harlow's if you weren't looking for it, but you MUST stop here for breakfast.  A classic hole in the wall place, you'll either love the dive-y atmosphere think you're in classic movie posters hell. But don't worry, the coffee is hot, the waitresses are friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing. If the full parking lot didn't give you that clue, the food will!  Prices are average and reasonable.  GET HERE for Sunday brunch or a Tuesday morning before work. You won't regret it and will most likely be back before you know it. A Tempe staple!

Classic Irish Pub on Mill. Perfect for fish and chips, a Guinness, and a great bar atmosphere!  The food here is great. I tried the fish and chips ($12) and it was perfect. Lightly battered, perfectly fried. The chips were different but complimentary to the meal.   They also had several cider beers on tap (my favorite). When I asked which beer I should try, the waitress offered bringing a sample of each so that I could know the beer before I committed to a pint. Great service!  The outdoor patio is great for parties. If it's cold, they have heaters during the winter. Summer has sprinklers. They've got live entertainment inside on weekends and also trivia nights. If you're looking for a place to hang that is casual and fun, try Rula Bula.

For a burger joint that caters to the local college kids in Tempe, this place is above average. You should go to The Chuck Box just to experience the way they cook their burgers in front of you while you're in line.   Also above average: the price. Expect to spend a little more than the average burger when you come here, but it's well worth it. And considering the venue is local, it's an even better excuse to get your booty here on your lunch break.

Lux has mastered the amazing way of combining happening, yet slow paced; friendly yet quietly independent; trendy, yet relaxed. Go to Lux for the amazing coffee and wifi, but come away with an appreciation for great spaces, new friends, and a quiet buzz that'll make you want to come back again and again.  The "new" Lux is a great space: once you think you've found a quiet place to crawl into and observe the crowd, you'll discover that the building just continues and continues! There's a spot to people watch, enjoy the football game that's on, or power through your emails at a large table. If you're not in the mood to stay inside, hit up the small patio and listen to the chatter around you.   If coffee isn't your thing, order wine or beer! I haven't tried their food but just from the looks of the dishes that friends have ordered, I don't think you can go wrong. The only thing that keeps Lux from getting five stars? It's crazy overpriced! Their cheapest glass of wine is $9.   All in all, go to Lux just for the experience. I promise you won't regret it.

If you're in the mood for a great italian meal and maybe a glass of wine or two, you cannot go wrong with Oregano's. Be prepared to wait for a table (it's a great restaurant!) but once you're inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I've been to this location several times. Small and with limited parking (in the back), it can be a little crowded. But the atmosphere is wonderful! Fairly quiet but with a great energy, the vibe here is unlike any other.  The food is absolutely on point. I most recently ordered a pizza and we were not able to finish it between two people.  If you're in downtown Scottsdale and need to grab a bite to eat, don't pass up Oregano's. A bit on the upscale side, it's well worth a visit!

Both entertaining and somewhat exciting, this bar is fun if you want to participate in what's going on around you.  Big Band is a dueling piano that features music by request. It's fun the first time, but can get somewhat dull after your second or third visit. How many times can you hear Journey played on a piano? Despite the repetition in music, it's still a blast to hear it played live by local talent.  There is a cover charge on the weekends (UGH!) and the cost of drinks are high for the small plastic cups you get in return. But for the entertainment, you can't go wrong. Request for someone in your party to get on stage and play the tambourine.

I should start this review where it really began: outside of the bar trying to find a parking spot. This place is in the heart of downtown Scottsdale, so parking is going to be an issue anywhere. Luckily it is next to a 3 hour (FREE!) parking garage, so plan just to park there instead of driving around.  I walked into Upper Deck around 7:30pm Saturday night and it was PACKED! Upper Deck is a two story bar with many comfortable places to sit and lots of TVs - couches are in the lounge area and there are several bars through-out the place.  The environment is inviting but the service is HORRIBLE. When we finally made our way through the crowd and to the bar, it took several attention grabbing gestures before the bartender even noticed me and when he finally got around to asking me what I wanted, he was rude, snobby, and disrespectful.  Overall, there are plenty of places to watch a sporting match and lots of places that deserve my business with better service. Despite the inviting atmosphere, I won't be patronizing this bar again.

What a great venue! I went on a Thursday night for the free comedy and was pleasantly surprised at the turn out, the comedy, and the great vibe.  If you're not into comedy, don't worry! The location allows for two set up - one half of the place was a bar and the other was a stage for the comedy. When the comedy was over, they opened the place up again. It was great!  The service wasn't super amazing but it was typical for your bar scene. The prices were average and the food was just okay.  Show up on Thursday nights at 8:30pm, get some free entertainment, and enjoy this place!

Hands down the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I wasn't really even in the mood for pizza but my date was and he suggested Barro's. I'm so glad I went!!  The food is unbelievable. I ordered a medium Kona Pizza (Teriyaki sauce, chicken, pineapple). With 8 slices, it was more then enough for me alone and I was happy I got to take some home. YUM.   The atmosphere is a typical pizza joint: clean, friendly, and welcoming. Wait time is average but worth it for these pizzas!  Prices are a little higher then you'd spend at Pizza Hut but only by about $10. Indulge! You won't regret it.

We are loyalty members because we like to travel a lot with our dog. Hands down this is the worst La Quinta we've ever stayed out.   Long story, short: if you're NOT a smoker, don't stay here. This hotel is smoker friendly and every room and every hallway smells like it. Generally dirty and in need of upgrades and repairs, I'm surprised this hotel passes any sort of inspection. The air conditioning didn't work half of the time, and that's a nightmare in LV.   If you are members like us, stay at the AIRPORT LA QUINTA. Cheaper, quieter, a lot nicer, friendlier, and overall a better experience.   Long story: we checked into this La Quinta in the afternoon. They were friendly and quickly put us into a room. When we got there, it smelled terrible. We are non smokers and it reeked of smoke. We called the front desk and they offered to move us. In the end, we moved rooms three times to finally get a roomed that we could "live with". At $100 a night, I was not happy but we stayed. That evening, our air conditioner stopped working. We called the front desk again and ask for someone to come up. He did, but quickly said this is how this room is and left. Definitely the most unpleasant night in an uncomfortable bed in a room that was hot and gross.   In the morning, we cancelled our remaining nights and moved to the La Quinta Airport location. Easily the best thing we did!! They allowed us to check in at 10am, gave us an excellent room, and it was cheaper than the other hotel!!  Do yourself a favor and stay at the airport location. Don't even bother with this LQ.

Of all the outdoor malls in Phoenix (and I've been to a lot of them), Tempe Marketplace is the best! It's a one stop shop for all of your needs.  If you're hungry, Tempe Marketplace has a great selection of places to dine on. If you're looking to sit down and enjoy a romantic meal, head over to Kabuki's for sushi. If you just want a quick bite to eat, there are several places that are steps from the state of the art Harkins movie theater that you'll enjoy. And maybe you're in the mood for ice cream, froyo, or coffee afterward? Tempe Marketplace has that too.  If you're into shopping, you can't go wrong. From the casual Target or Ross to the upscale Gap and Tiffy's, you'll find a pair of pants that's just right for you.  And if that's not enough, they've got several outdoor fireplaces, a splash pad for the kiddos, and a large stage that plays live music.  Check out Tempe Marketplace, you won't be disappointed!

If you're looking for a local coffee shop in southern Tempe, Solo Coffee is your place. Locally owned and roasting great coffee from Cortez, this is a staple.  Solo isn't large and spacious, but more quant and eclectic. Local art covers the walls, an LP is playing on the record player, and someone is surely cozied up on the red velvet couch that sits in the center of the coffee shop.  If you get bored with your work, fear not! You can play Battleship, Chess, or Jenga to pass the time. And above all else, the coffee is superb. So get to Solo and enjoy warming up when it's cold outside.

Cookiez is such a fun place! From the outside, it's almost hard to find - the shop is small and looks almost like a hole-in-the-wall venue. But don't be fooled, go inside! You'll be hit with a wall of delicious smelling cookies and be confronted with way too many wonderful choices for ice cream.  Get an ice cream sandwich! You'll have trouble deciding between the numerous homemade cookie options - I tried the peanut butter cookie and it was wonderful. Next dilemma: which ice cream to use? Again, another wall of delicious options, so you cannot go wrong. I went with rocky road and was delighted.  The sandwich is a lot larger then you'd expect. Easily the size of my hand, I can't believe I haven't tried this place sooner. Skip dessert at the place you had dinner and go try Cookiez on Mill. You won't regret it!

I've tried a lot of sushi places in Phoenix, but this is my FAVORITE!  The best AND worst part about Yen Sushi: they have great specials every night after 8pm. They place a lot of their quality rolls on "happy hour" for only $5! The bad part about that? It's crowded! This is a small sushi bar tucked in a strip mall-type setting, so when they fill up there isn't much room to wait for a table.  It didn't get 5 stars from me because of the service. It's lacking! Even when tables are open, expect to wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before you are greeted. When you ARE seated, refills usually come only when you ask for them.  Overall, this place is exceptional. Sure the service may need some improvement but you can't beat the quality of the food, the specials they offer, and the inviting environment. Give it a try, you'll love it!

If you want to try something different in the world of sushi and spend $15, come to Teharu! Don't expect the sushi to be super amazing, but know that you'll have fun.   Teharu is a conveyor belt sushi restaurant. It's not ideal for groups, as you'll be sitting at a sushi bar, so just invite your significant other and go have fun! The pricing is based on the color of the plate, so you can spend as little as $1 or as much as $100, but I average about $15-$20 a visit (including tip and drink).  The quality sushi is average - don't expect anything super fresh or new to show up on the conveyor belt. It may be a great place to take a sushi newbie, as there are a TON of options they create for little cost upfront. The portion sizes are smaller too, so this may be a great chance for you to try sushi you may not have been willing to spend $15/roll on.

For a bar that is supposed to be an Irish Pub, this place isn't very Irishy or Pubby (are those words?).  The service is average, the drinks are moderately priced. I like the place as a bar but I don't like that their claim to fame is an Irish Pub. You do not get to be an Irish Pub because you carry Guinness or color the bar a dark cherry finish.  The food here isn't the best. It's classic bar food but even a step below that in quality. I had the fish and chips (over $10) and have had better at fast food joints.  There are plenty of bars in Tempe Marketplace. Give another a try, you'll be happy you did.

This place is amazing and should warrant at least one visit from you!  The atmosphere and layout of the bar is wonderful. More than half of the bar is dedicated to comfy couches, nifty tables, and flat screen TVs. The lighting is low and casual and the people are friendly.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me: the service isn't the BEST I've ever experienced at a bar. It takes a minute to wave down the bartender for a drink and you typically have to ask for a refill.  One perk: they don't charge your card until  you tab out so there isn't that annoying "hold" on funds the next day.

By far, this is my favorite Mojo location! The Tempe Marketplace is a beautiful setting for my favorite dessert - it's beside the water spouts and a group of couches and it's nice to take a break and relax there.  The only down-side to this location is that it always smells almost "too clean" - kind of like a hospital. It can be unappealing when you first walk in, and it's very very noticeable. Of course I'd rather it be clean than unsanitary, but it's a little weird.  Oh, and Lion King is playing. Weird? :)

I love Mojo Yogurt! You can't go wrong with a frozen yogurt company on Mill Avenue. With their late hours, you can practically get a cup at any time!  Here's a tip: hit up the goodies bar before you fill your cup with yogurt. Layering the goodies can be fun! And if you are really adventurous, ask for the Cheesecake Bites that they store in the refrigerator in the back. YUM!

I went to Scottsdale Healthcare Shea for the many support groups and classes they offer. Most events are free to the public and are in place to serve the community.  When I went to my first support group, it was run by a licensed psychologist (a big plus for support groups, as sometimes they can go a negative way and need someone there that can handle the sensitive topics). The group was warm and embracing! I felt at home and comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas, all of which were received nicely. The group offered continued resources, tips, and ideas.   If you're looking for classes, support groups, or events this is the place to go: http://www.shc.org/Events

I have to be honest, the last few Italian places I've been too didn't impress me so I wasn't too excited to go to RigaTony's. Boy am I glad I went!   Service: absolutely perfect. Not too over the top but just enough to provide the quality attention I needed. Refills were prompt, questions were addressed, smiles all around.  Food: so great! I got the stuffed parmesan shells - YUM! They filled me up and left me wanting more. I tried my date's chicken alfredo pasta and almost wished I'd had that too. Seems like you can't go wrong with what you order here. Plus the house salad and bread added a great touch.   The ambiance and restaurant itself was clean, bright, and smartly decorated. Plus this place is a LOCAL business. Why not try it out? Plenty of parties in here were 6+ - may be the spot to take a large group of friends or family.

This is the best Buffalo Wild Wings I've ever been to!  We went on a Sunday afternoon for football, right before the Cardinals game. Now, anytime I've done this before at a different BDubs, I always end up regretting not getting there sooner because it's so full! But this place is like an undiscovered gem - there were actual open tables!  The service was par for Buffalo Wild Wings: nothing special but not disappointing.  The food was also par: great!  Go here for the football games before people discover it!

We walked into Joey's of Chicago on a whim on New year's Eve night. Procrastination at it's best, we had been searching for a quick place to eat before going out to celebrate 2011 with drinks but there were very few quality places open.  It was 9:40pm and we came across Joey's. Hoping they were open, we parked and went inside. They WERE open but we were the only ones there, and on top of that, they were closing in 20 minutes. No worries, the staff were AMAZING! They took our order, delivered it to our table, and closed up shop while we ate. There was no rush to finish and they were courteous and smiling as they asked how the quality of the food was.  Obviously the service was top notch, but the FOOD is what really sealed the deal. I don't think I've ever had such an amazing cheeseburger in all of my fast food experience. My boyfriend ordered the Italian Hoagie and I've never seen that guy devour a sub so fast! We did not try to hot dogs, but how could you with such an amazing cheeseburger combo deal? (Cheeseburger, fries, and a drink for $6!).  Overall, Joey's of Chicago has a new raving fan! I'll definitely be back for more :)

Don't waste your time here, this restaurant needs lots of work.  Our first encounter was with the hostess and it was awkward and confusing. She tried to give us a free appetizer but then the waiter took it away! Weird right?!  When we sat down, it was an awkward seating arrangement. The tables were in strange locations and the serving station was in the center of the room. Basically it just seemed like an odd set-up. Also the menu reminded me of kindergarden: a folded out piece of paper.  Items were a bit pricey but we were excited to get some awesome pasta. Instead we got this non-cohesive dinner that just didn't taste right. It was a huge bust and a great disappointment.  I would recommend trying other places in Westgate because this is definitely NOT a winner.

Originally I reviewed Tuscan Oven after a visit a few months ago. Bad experience. The waiting staff was awful, the menu wasn't cohesive, and the food was poor. I recommended that you pass this place up for the other options at Westgate.  I would like to say that, despite my review, I gave the restaurant another chance last night. I was on a time crunch and was looking to enjoy a quick pizza. Enjoyment is what I got! This place made HUGE changes for the better!  We were greeted and seated quickly, with a smile. The menu went from a fold out piece of paper to a simple and clean menu. They removed the "southern" style vibe from the menu and replaced it with classic, original, and more unique and authentic pasta options. Overall, great improvements to the menu but they could use a few more options for pizza.  And the food! It was great! The pizza was cooked perfectly, delivered quickly, and was fabulous!  I would now recommend this place. I'm glad they made the improvements they needed and hope they continue the trend!

You gotta hand it to Buffalo Wild Wings: they are the place to go for football on a Sunday. With TVs lining the walls, you are definitely going to find the game you came in for. It should be noted that Sundays are PACKED - get there a half hour before your game is going to start. And if your game is at the same time as the Cardinals game, you may be sitting outside. Don't worry, they've got heaters in the winter and sprinklers in the summer for their patio :)  I like the layout of Tempe's Buffalo Wild Wings. The environment is always clean and the waitstaff is always very helpful. Being at a bar for 3+ hours can be a challenge for any waiter and these folks do it well. Our orders are always correct, our beers are always refilled in a timely manner, and they're always smiling and happy.  If you need a place to watch the game, go here! You'll love the wings, the beer, and the atmosphere.

What an amazing place! From the moment you pull up, the vibe at JoBot is unlike any other coffee shop I've been to in Phoenix (or ever, for that matter!). Located in the heart of Roosevelt Row, this lovely place fits right in to the culture and ambience of its surroundings.  With a huge outdoor front patio, JoBot is a perfect place to hang with friends, get work done, or just enjoy their great coffee on the front porch. Averaged priced, you'll get more value from one cup of coffee here than your Starbucks. Plus, you'll be supporting local businesses!  Get to JoBot at least once while you're in Phoenix.

I love, love, love this bar! With a great selection of beers at a decent price, this place is a must if you're in Tempe. Plus the owner is amazing!  We went on Friday night and enjoyed the live music and beer tasting they had going on. When the crowd dissipated, we sat back and enjoyed the company of friends at their expansive bar. We ordered several appetizers (those cheeseburger sliders are amazing!) and enjoyed all of them.   I can't wait to go here again!

We are loyalty members because we like to travel a lot with our dog. Hands down this is the best La Quinta to stay at while in Las Vegas.  Long story, short: we first checked into the LQ nearer to the strip. What a terrible decision! Smoker-friendly, rooms that are gross and in need of repair, air conditioning that doesn't work, loud. We are so happy that we cancelled there and moved to this LQ!  Quiet, clean, and friendly. This hotel is perfect! They shuttle you to the strip, provide breakfast until 10am, and have upgraded rooms (think Keurig machines, nice bathrooms, mini fridges, wall mounted flat screen TVs).   The service here is also really spot on. When we cancelled our other reservation with the LQ near the strip, we called this location to book a reservation. They offered to let us check in at 10am and had the room ready for us when we arrived. Far above and beyond what we expected. Thank you La Quinta!

Fantastic venue! Province really adds a touch of class and elegance in a way that isn't pushy or over the top. Located in the Westin Hotel, the restaurant feels very modern! You can choose to sit inside in a beautifully decorated and spacious dining area or enjoy their fabulous patio with fireplaces and a great water feature.   The food was unbelievable! I sampled their tuna and watermelon appetizer and fell in love - what an amazing combination that I'd never have thought of.  If the food isn't enough, the service is superb. Every interaction with the staff was excellent - you can tell they enjoy their restaurant and are happy to be there.   I cannot wait to come back to Province as soon as possible.

For a local coffee shop, OSP does everything right for me.  Blazing fast internet, perfect coffee, and a local scene that supports community. The walls are covered in art from local artists, the coffee is bought at fair market value (meaning they buy coffee from companies that pay their workers minimum wage - Starbucks does not!), and on the weekends they are pumping music by local bands.  If you're looking to get work done, which is often the case for me, they've got plenty of comfy spaces to curl up in and get things done. The atmosphere is laid back and the people are super friendly.  Go try it out! They're next door to Tempe Yarn (they're kind of hard to see from the street, but park when you see Tempe Yarn).

A great addition to Tempe Marketplace, The Thirsty Lion provides a great atmosphere, a wonderful selection of beers on tap, and reasonable prices. Plus the food is pretty wonderful (and with a great happy hour, you can't go wrong here).   With an expansive selection of indoor seating, you can choose to sit at a high top, at the bar, or at a comfy table indoors. If you'd like to experience their outdoor seating, you won't be disappointed with the several fire pits and lovely chairs.  The service can be spotty (previously Maria-Maria, they're still a fairly new establishment) but the great atmosphere and food makes up for it. Moderately priced, it's well worth venturing in for a drink if it's cold outside.

I've found my new favorite bar in Tempe! With great and friendly service and a warm atmosphere, Lucky Break just works.  I went there last night because I'd seen a few tweets mentioning the newly opened bar. It as fairly quiet and laid back but pretty soon it filled up with guys playing pool and having a laugh. Perfect.   They've got a wide variety of beer. A tad on the pricier side but do-able. Not sure if they have a happy hour - that would be awesome.  With a ton of televisions, this place is perfect to watch the game. And if the game gets boring, go play some pool! Visit Lucky Break, you won't be disappointed.

So disappointed in this event. I'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but I'm super unhappy that I didn't get to participate in the way that I wanted.  The traffic was horrible. Did they not cap the ticket sales? For 25 food trucks, there were 13,000 people? That's 520 people per truck - no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food! No normal restaurant can serve that many people.  Planning was awful, parking was awful. Charging for parking, ticket entry, AND food? Wow.  Dear Salt River Fields, next time CAP THE TICKET SALES -- maybe a few thousand at most. Charge more if you have to (clearly people are interested). Invite more food trucks!

Could ask for better chinese delivery! I ordered Hunan at 8:30pm one night just because they were nearby and I'm super impressed. This is the place in Tempe for chinese food!  The order came quickly, within 20 minutes. The order was correct and they threw in the extras that most chinese places should but some forget: sweet and sour sauce, duck sauce, crunchy noodles, and of course the fortune cookies.  The quantity of food was crazy. I was barely able to finish a fourth of the meal! Left overs for days!  The quality was great. The shrimp were large sized, the rice was excellent, the noodles and sauces were wonderful.  Let me put it to you this way: if you need chinese food in Tempe, order from Hunan!
