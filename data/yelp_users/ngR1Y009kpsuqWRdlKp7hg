After going through hell through JFK, I was happy to land here.  Easy to get through all the gates, and the outside of the airport was very pretty with nice paved roads and cacti!! Cabs were available as soon as I left the building.  The escalator to exit the building had some fake flying airplanes and some rocky fake mountains that were pretty also.    The car rental service is the best.  I've never seen such an easier way to drop off a rental car.  There were signs to drop off the car like there were to drop off someone at the airport! So convenient and so fast! I thought it would take forever to drop of the car but a guy was outside checking everything.

This place was unique for me because everyone seemed like they were inside smoking but it was an indoor outdoorish place.  There were heated lights and it was the only place that I found pretty crowded where if you walked the streets there weren't a lot of people.    The food was good, I had the steak fajita, which you can't go wrong because its just steak.  But I also had a fish taco which was pretty good.  My boyfriend had the pick three meal, so he picked tacos, chimichanga, and enchilada.  His choice was good and the chimichanga was delish.    The bathrooms were very rustic looking but it seemed to look that way, decent for a funky place like that.  They had live music Friday night, where a guy was doing bad covers on a few good songs.  The waitstaff was overall nice and they checked back at us here and there.  Overall I'd go back if I was in around Scottsdale again!

YUMMY.  We all made a trip out to Palace Station for the $5 pai gow tables and the Oyster Bar!  So the wait was about 10 minutes, but that's because we came at a decent time and there were 7 of us.  We ordered a dozen oysters, fresh and pungent horseradish!    Oyster shooters was amazing in their bloody marys.   And the gumbo, wow you get to see it made in front of you!! It takes a while for it to make but it's worth while and amazing.  One of the best gumbo's I've had!  The shrimp wasn't overcooked, the rice on the side was delicious.  The only thing about the entrees were that they were HUGE! So I recommend sharing!  I shared it with two other people.    The Etoufee was really good too, the seafood in it wasn't overcooked, highly recommended.    Everything was amazing here, I wish they had a place like this in NY!! And amazing service, they were happy to pose for us too and we got their email addresses to send them the photos lol.

I was recommended this place by a cab driver when I asked him where was a good place to buy drinks and have food.  The cab driver gave me the address, and then called my boyfriend's cell phone back to apologize because he gave us the wrong address.  So I realized that it's pretty hard to find a restaurant that is opened late around Bell so we ended up here.  UMMM, I didn't realize that it was like a hooters, but with uglier girls.  The only decent one was the hostess at the front door, where most people enter and think all of them have to be decent looking but they are all ugly.  They had no hips and no butts. And bad teeth. And they sang off key.  The worse were the creepy old geezers that come in and just stare at these poor girls.  And pretend to have birthdays so they can have 4 half naked girls sing at their table.    I give it two stars because I liked the fact that they had plenty of TVs.  The black and bleu burger was really good, the clam strips were ehh, really tough and really greasy.  My boyfriend got the sausage artichoke fettuccini which was a little greasy too and too heavy.  But I'd rather go to Hooters!

There was no hassles with renting a car, I was in and out after less than 10 minutes.  The staff was very nice and the car was clean, it was cheap, and it was easy to drop off the car at the airport with the most convenient airport drop off lot for car rentals!
