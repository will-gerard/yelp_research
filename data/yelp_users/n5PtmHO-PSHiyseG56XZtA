I've tried Ultrastar, AMC, Studio Movie Grill, Dickinson, and Century theatres.  Not only is Harkins the best theater option out there with there free popcorn(with shirt) and $1 sodas (with cup), this is their best location!  I will never go anywhere else again!

The food here is great.  Best Chinese I've found in AZ and not super pricey.  Gary, the owner, is always here and always cheerful, friendly, and always remembers us and our orders, even when we haven't  been in for a year!  Needless to say, this place is awesome and you need to come here!

This place blows.  Staff seems bored and depressed, not to mention rude.  Plus there was a 20 minute wait for an empty bar/restaurant.  Lame.

Great margaritas, but kinda pricy for what they have. Their food isn't all that special :(

Very disappointing. Showed up at 11 am, expecting the market to close at 12, more than half of the market was packed up. The booths that were still open wouldn't even talk to me when I showed interest in their product due to them being too "busy" packing up.

Disappointment all around.  Staff rude, food bland, salsa tastes like tomato water.  Only neat thing here is the mexican drinks on tap.  Extremely disappointing.

Food was overpriced and mediocre at best.  Service was horrid.  We were greeted by one, order was taken by our main server, and food was served by yet another.  That and our actual server came back one time to ask if we needed anything, deemed our request unimportant and proceeded to never come back, but instead talked to the table behind us the whole time.  Won't be coming back.

Ok, so let me start off with the fact that this bar is just like any other bar in terms of drinks (although I view them as pretty weak for the price, but this is Scottsdale.)  Upon walking into this bar, it looks pretty promising.  However, after standing at the bar for approximately 10 minutes, we figured out the only way to get the two waitresses, who were apparently attached at the hip, was to move to the other side of the bar in their direct line of view.    Once we finally got our two drinks for 15.00, we found them to be pretty weak for such a pricey drink.  Later we found that they don't accept plastic forms of payment unless your charge is above 20$.  This wouldn't have been a problem had they told us prior so we could've kept a tab.  Instead we made a purchase at the bar that had totaled 17$ and later tried to get an additional drink and after it was made, was told we needed to spend 20$ before we could use a card to pay for it.    The service is pretty much nonexistent.  The servers are more concerned with making money via dancing.  I understand that it was a Tuesday night and that it isn't as busy as a Friday would be, but being a server in the past, I also understand that when you have customers (other than the occasional leerer) if you treat them right they will tend to tip more than the dollar you would have earned, tucked in your pants for the pole dance.  Also, as we were leaving, we did hear (from our car across the street) the bouncer loudly say "we're closed!  Pay up!" at 0202.  Really?  Hmmm...  Won't be wasting my money on this place anymore when there are PLENTY of other excellent bar options within walking distance.

If I could give less stars, I would.  Pros:  very nice quality, large screen and neat seats that move to the movie.  Cons:  well lets see....  We went to see the hunger games.  We had a Groupon for 2 tickets and a large popcorn.  Sounds awesome, I know.  Well we upgraded to the d-box seats that move to the movie for an extra 8 dollars a ticket. The seats were neat and all, but definitely not worth it, and not very comfy...    I wanted to use a coupon I had gotten for signing up for their email list, and was told to go to the box office to have them print it out.  The, what I assumed was the, manager told me he couldn't accept because the fine print, which was invisible, said it HAD to be printed.  Whatever.    Concessions are waaaaaaay overpriced, I mean way more than the already obligatory astronomical movie markup.  In my opinion, you shouldn't charge that much for a small amount of nonrefillable stale popcorn.  (really. Really stale btw).  Customer service here sucked.  No one was older than 17, which isn't a bad thing, except that inexperienced management leads to horrible service.  I heard a few times "OK, whatever."  and "well there's nothing I can do".  That and the fact that the place was pretty empty, but for some reason every time you needed someone, no one was there.  Two concession stands and no one there?  Really?    OH!!  And forgot to mention!  Movie was to start at 730.  They wouldn't let anyone in until 720 because they were "cleaning". Sure didn't look clean to me with all the popcorn on our seats...  PS- I used to be a movie theater employee, and I'm ashamed of what they are doing to the movie going experience.  Needless to say, I will NEVER be coming back.  Wish I could get a refund and just donate it to a good theater just for being there.

Ok.  So let me start this by saying that I love watching movies and as soon as I found out there was a new theater opening up right down the street from me, I was super excited.  Especially since they were to serve food and alcohol!  As soon as Groupon offered a ticket and a soda for 5 bucks, I figured "How can you go wrong?!".    Well, we went for the first time tonight (7:30 on a Saturday night) and I must say I was pretty disappointed.  The way the theater entrance is set up is extremely odd and chaotic.  It reminds me of an airport with the people lining up, waiting on benches to get in to their theater and a bar in the corner of the lobby.  Needless to say, it was not a relaxing experience at all.   Luckily we chose a movie that did not come out this weekend or we would have been lined up by groups, similar to the way we now board planes.  They offer "Reserved Seating" for a dollar extra per ticket.  I strongly recommend paying the extra buck.  You have to buy it at their ticket kiosk or online only.  Do not go to the box office because they cannot offer you reserved seating.  They seat in this order: Reserved and then general admission for the older movies or Reserved and then in groups of general admission (printed on your ticket, I'm assuming in the order you purchase them).  The difference is huge.  There are two types of seating.  A love seat style, comfy chairs with swivel tabletops that are mostly reserved (these are the only ones you can reserve) and then there are the general admission seats.  These are literally office rolling chairs that sit behind a desk that looks like it belongs in a high school computer lab.  We lucked out and got there 30 minutes early and were able to snag one of the last love seat chairs, thank goodness, or I would have been pretty upset...  As for the waiters, they were very nice and attentive.  I honestly thought that it would have been super distracting with them bringing food in and out during the movie as I am very easily distracted when it comes to theaters.  But I was pleasantly suprised that they were considerate and didn't bother me at all.  After the movie we attempted to try and upgrade our additional groupon general admission tickets for reserved tickets, only to find out that Groupon and movie passes are not able to be upgraded.  The manager was nice enough to exchange our Groupons for movie passes (so they didn't expire for a good while), but we still had to rebuy tickets to reserve tickets.  Like I said, the box office can't do reserved seating, but the ticket kiosks are supposed to be able to.  We tried and failed two times and had to have the manager assist us, even he was unable to purchase them.  However, A+ for the manager as he gave us extra movie passes for our troubles and instructions on how to buy them at home.  Sucks that if you buy them online they charge you an extra dollar per ticket (in addition to the dollar to reserve) just to buy online.  All in all, I'd rather get to Harkin's earlier and go out after the movie to a restaurant than deal with this theater.  Advice for Future Studio Movie Grill Goers:  Buy your tickets online (spend the extra two bucks!)

Here with my man getting his hair cut.  Waaaay overdue.  Not only did they do a great job, but they kept me entertained with 2 dollar beers and cute kitschy items. Will be back!
