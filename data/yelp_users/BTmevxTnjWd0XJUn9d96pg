Owner Brian Peitz is a master trainer/motivator who expertly mixes traditional and innovative fitness techniques that have helped me attain fitness goals I could never have reached on my own. The facility, equipment, and trainers are all top notch. Highly recommended!

Liberty Metals Group took $9,400 for silver eagle coins order on 7/2014, and failed to deliver product as promised. After a year of deceit and broken promises, we filed a civil suit for Breach of Contract and were awarded a Default Judgement. They will not respond to any communications (mail, phone, email) and we are now in process of sending them to collections. They have multiple judgements against them and appear to be in hiding. Our lawyer has recommended if they don't pay that we next file a criminal suit for fraud as they took money with no intent/ability to deliver the goods. May as well have been robbed. Cannot stress enough, DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH.
