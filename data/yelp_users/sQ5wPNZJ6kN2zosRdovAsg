It had been ages since I had been to Baby Kay's...it's kinda just off the beaten path that I forget about it.....what a mistake. After wandering back a month ago my better half and I have made it our Monday spot along with a few other trips in between. Mondays are beer battered shrimp with dirty rice a a wonderful crawfish sauce that rocks my world (shrimp are big and sweet and you get 8 which trust me makes for ALOT of food). My hubby loves the chicken and sausage gumbo...so much so that we get an extra for lunch the next day. All of the food has a wonderful spicy kick that is seriously addictive and the patio is great for this time of year. Of course we sit at the bar where Jimmy takes great care of us. Noelle whom some of you may remember from her Ticoz days works the luch crowd. So if you haven't checked it out its worth the trip and a Happy Hour cocktail with Jimmy.

I have been a Carlos'Briens fan for many years and having not been there for a while my better half and I decided to grab a quick bite at the bar last night. I really have nothing good to say about any part of our visit. Having been in the restaurant business myself I can be pretty forgiving when it is obvious that the place is understaffed and I am willing to be patient as long as it is acknowledged that I am sitting there waiting...instead we literally waited (at the bar) for 15 minutes without either one of the bartenders making so much as eye contact. I finally had to wave my arms before somebody said Hi. I was not the only one having this problem as both people to either side on me had been waiting longer than we had and a couple of the tables gave up and left. We finally placed our order of queso dip and a chimichanga with a bartender that was less than thrilled. The queso was really bad and chimi was mediocore at best. Nobody ever asked if there was an issue with the queso as the bowl was literally untouched. On the upside the chips and salsa are still good. We paid our tab and bailed. I made a quick stop to the restroom only to find it out of soap with the trashcan overflowing and paper towels all over the floor. All and all a very disappointing trip. Carlos O'Briens needs to make a serious effort to get their restaurant back to what it used to be.

...ok this is a continuation of my search for a decent HH after being sorely disappointed in Dicks Hideaway. The HH iat Sierra Bonita fit the bill perfectly ...my husband and I decided to give Kenny's "special" margarita a try. Good Lord...that was a GREAT drink and only $6.00 in a big glass. All of their specialty margaritas are $6.00 along with $2.00 domestic bottles... specials on draft and well drink and they have a couple of wines on special as well. All of their appetizers are 1/2 price and you can easily make a meal out of them. Kenny and Miguel are great bartenders and the bar is full of regulars that they know by first name. If you decide to stick around for dinner their fish specials are alway a favorite of mine and my husband loves their carne asada. Nate the owner was busy smoking a brisket outside that smelled divine and will be todays lunch special.....mmmmm......we will be back!!!

Friday night armed with our umbrella and Groupon coupon we finally decided to give Padres a try....drive by it all the time but have never stopped in. We had called ahead for a reservation as our coupon suggested but when we got there nobody was in the dining area...yet so we asked if we could sit at the bar instead. We were served by a great bartender with a good smile. She promptly gave us menus and cocktails. We started with the queso dip. It was more like a spinach dip which I liked but my husband is more of a velveeta guy so not quite "cheesy" enough for him. By this time the little place was packed (only 5:45). It appears that they have quite the HH crowd and several HH specials but we were going off the menu. My husband had the tacos and I had the small steak, taco and enchilada plate with beans and rice. It was all very good and neither of us had any complaints. Even though the place was full our bartender was spot on and we never lacked for a drink and she happily boxed up the left overs. (I might add that the left over queso dip was fabulous stuffed inside chicken breasts). We will be back if for no other reason than to work our way throught the extensive taco list which staring... at everybody elses plate made want to snag one when they weren't looking. We will be back and maybe late enough to catch the live music.

It's me again the girl with no picture but here comes the review anyway,,.I should have checked with my fellow yelpers but alas I did not. My hubby and I stopped in Pink Taco on Saturday thinking it was a great place to grab and appetizer and a margarita and sit on the patio. HUGE mistake...this place has to go down as having the absolute WORST service. Our waitress looked like she had a REALLY rough night the night before and while friendly definetly was not quick on her toes and those nails....anyway besides the service (had to go to the hostess to get silverware and napkins). We were served water...finally... in a really crusty glass....come on people how can you not notice these things....our margaritas tasted like coconut and I am pretty sure they left out the tequila but hey it was HH so you gotta save somewhere. The queso dip was the oddest queso ever....I think they just pile a bunch of leftover whatever in it and then never asked if we needed more chips to go with it....I will however give thumbs up to the chicken skewers which were tasty and worth the five dollars. It's too bad because the place has potential just lacking in the detail and execution.....

Boy you people just won't give me a break on the photo thing....One of these days I promise but in the meantime here goes the review....this used to be a really great spot but lately it is lacking...We stopped in yesterday for a quick cocktail and to meet a friend....no great happy hour specials and no happy hour food at all (sorry but in this economy I'm kinda looking for a break). I wound up having the cactus margarita which I asked them to make with Sauza and it has to down down as the WORST top shelf margarita...I realize times are tough all over but it tasted like lemonaid and if there was tequila in it I sure couldn't taste it.....won't be coming back. We left there and went to Sierra Bonita where my expectations were more than met....please check out the review.

I have been waiting patiently for the meatloaf to hit the menu after getting to taste it a couple of weeks ago (they were still tweaking the recipe)....finally it made it's debut on Monday and thanks to a text from our boy Matt we wasted no time in getting there....Yes...the meatloaf rocks and is good comfort food at its best. Two thick slabs on top of cheesy creamy potatoes and seasonal baby carrots and asparagus. I think I am in love with the meatloaf (and Matt B.) Nathan you nailed it with this one. By the way... there are other new items on the menu as well but I will probably never make it past the meatloaf.

....sorry folks didn't mean to post BEFORE I wrote the review...this interview is LONG over due....this is one of the places that I stumbled into after not being impressed with Postinos....again I am alwasy on the prowl for a good HH spot and this one is really good. All appetizers are half price and being a wine lover they have a great true Italian Chianti for $5.00 a glass (other specials as well but I never vere from the chianti). The staff is very attentive no matter how busy they are and the Owners Myra and Joe take the time to talk to every table and or bar patron. The homemade bread with pepper oil is amazing and is one of reason that going to the gym does me absolutely no good. My husband and I are also fans of splitting an entree which is more than enough for the two of (remember there's bread). Joe is also working on pizza out the back door (only 50 pies a night). My husband is working on Myra to serve them at the bar but so far without success... but he will continue to try. This is a great place to bring family for a special occasion or to just be like us and belly up to the bar for some true New York Italian.

While the atmosphere is good the food is about the worst that I have had and the service wasn't exceptional. Both meals were nothing but fat and when we complained our waitress agreed with us but made no offer to exchange for something else or to take them off the bill (and this isn't a cheap place). Our waitress did pass my comments on to the manager who was sitting across from us but he just shrugged his shoulders. Not to be recommended.

First and foremost....great food and BETTER margaritas so much so we had them cater our wedding reception. Paco (manager at the 16th & Camelback location) and his team did a fantastic job and all of our guests raved about the food. We will be using them again for our next event.  Sherry and Corey

Yup it's me again.....the person without the picture whos' opinion you might not be abale to trust but I will give my opinion anyway....after reading all the rave reviews on... Pizza Pizza Yelp about it.....I had to give Pizza Metro a try.....it was absolutely wonderful...who knew...certainly not me.  We made a reservation although on a Tuesday not needed but we were told that it is a good idea for Thursday, Friday and Saturday. We took our own wine (only a $5.00 corking fee).....The owner and his manager Michael were VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we were taken care. They brought us a plate of flat bread with a mix of capers, onions, eggplant that was very yummy (sorry to you pleople that it tasted like tap water...I have to disagree).....we then shared a ceasar salad again more than enough for two....we had such a hard time deciding on entrees that we wound up splitting the lasagna and a meatball pizza (not really meatballs but rather homemade sausage)....all of it was out of this world and the lasagna was probably the best I have ever had....the pizza was wood fired with the perfect amount of topping....all homemade. All in all a great dinner leaving us comfortable full but not miserable....it will become one of our haunts and we are looking forward to trying their new restaurant "Amarone" which we have been told will have a full bar and a larger establishment and a little more upscale.....Thanks to all who wrote their reviews and made us curious enough to give it a try...  P.S.....TOTAL BILL ONLY $32.00...and they are working on their liquor license which they hope to have in a few weeks

Hmmm....where to start...the concept is great and the location is good but... and there are some BIG buts.....the parking is horrendous. ...second complaint is that happy hour ends at four (4)....what the @!#$. The wine list is not that impressive and cost 22.00 with tip for two glasses. I think that it might be the perfect place on a saturday or sunday where glasses of wine are $5.00 till four (4)...on the other hand Aiellos is RIGHT next door and has 1/2 priced appetizers and drinks till 6 pm and the food and service was wonderful but that's another review......

My husband and I finally made it to Brio across from Kierland last Saturday night. We usually do not stray too far from the Central corridor and RARELY to Scottsdale but this place was worth it. The place is beautiful inside and busy so I recommend a reservation. We ordered a bottle of Malbec (tasty and only $27.00). My husband ordered the lobster bisque...1 word for that ....mmmmm...and I don't think that's even a word. I ordered a chop salad which was more than enough to share....we followed up by splitting the lasagna. This was where it really got good because they split for us which to me is always a plus and kudo's to the person that can eat a whole piece. The pasta was light and fresh and it was covered with 1/2 alfredo and 1/2 red sauce. Maybe not traditional but was REALLY good. I wish I could have had desert but there was just NO room. All of the other food looked really good as well....and...before I forget the service was great. We were served by Saira who knew her stuff....she was friendly, out going with a great personality and helped answer all of our questions plus threw out her favorites. Next time I am going for HH to try that menu because $2.95 appetizers ALWAYS works for me but if there is no seat at the bar than I would be just as happy in the dining room and I would definetly ask for Saira. P.S....this place won't break your wallet.
