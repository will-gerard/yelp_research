Bad experience on reservation. Called before we left the house and reserved seats for 15 people, they did not notify us that there's no seat available. We drove 2 hours to try their food and hoping to get  seated on time.  instead, we have to wait 2 hours. We ended up going to the other new ra sushi  at north Scottsdale since there was no wait and food were served less than the time waiting on this branch

Awesome authentic Korean food with Korean TV shows. Owners are the actual server and very mindful of their costumer.

Awesome place!!! I use to go here  since it was a little less popular back in 2010 then people start to notice this place and got crowded. ( long long wait) Now , they're waiting time is less than 15 mins.

New establishment around north west of phoenix. They have allot of sushi with fruits and the price is affordable. Sushi rice did improved since the last time I came here. It use to break apart when I pick them up, now its more dense. They have no wait list and they let you choose where you prefer to sit down.

Awesome place... The owner is hands with the business... He even gave us discounts and free taste for their desert..  I honestly don't know why some people thinks it's terrible because the one I had was amazingly crispy and hot
