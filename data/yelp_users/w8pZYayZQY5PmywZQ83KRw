Now THIS is an Airport.   Compared to the STL Airport, this place seems massive.   It's a straightforward airport, no shenanigans. It's large and is a really nice and updated facility. I wouldn't mind having to spend a couple hours here. Way more comfy than some other airports.   Most airport problems are derived with the airline. No h8 here!

Talk about Karaoke dive bar, amiright?  This Scottsdale beauty is the essence of a Karaoke dive bar complete with tacky decorations and lonely souls.   They even have someone who will wait on you! Fancy pantsy.   At no point did I regret the decision of coming here and I would totally return. It's nothing fancy and does it's job well! I'm in.

Okay soooo the Vegas Airport isn't all that nice. I have to say that the only redeeming quality is that it has slot machines but then again...it's a little unnecessary.  -The gates are a little hard to get to. You have to run around in a circle to get to the other side.  -The walkways are narrow and cluttered by tons of trashy kiosks and slot machines....TOO MANY SLOT MACHINES -The bathrooms are filthy  But on the upside they have tons of food choices!   Until next time LV....

Oh Valley Ho, you make me swoon.   Your valet and concierge are very professional and nice. I don't get called Mr. often, but when I do, it's at Valley Ho. They are super helpful and pleasant. They add to the paradise of staying at the Ho.   The lounge area at the entrance is also very nice. There is an outdoor seating area where you can hang by a fire. I took advantage of this multiple times. Valley has an amazing little bar/lounge area that is pretty swanky. Great for staying up late and hanging out but still being a 3 minute walk from your hotel bed.   Staying here was so relaxing and comforting. Valley Ho's rooms are the perfect balance of boutique-trendy and luxury. They are very spacious, clean, and relaxing.   My room had a pretty awesome bathroom. There was a bathtub and a shower (that were separate). I managed to find time to hang out in that bathtub...well worth it. The entire bathroom is rounded off with clouded glass. You can turn on blue ambiance lighting that makes the bathroom glow--pretty classy.   I can't wait to go back to Valley Ho!
