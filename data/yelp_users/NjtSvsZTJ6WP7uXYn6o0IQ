We had been looking for a solid Mexican place that is genuine, but in the good way.. not that other way. This place delivered. When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation.   It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.  The chicken chimi. A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again.   The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something.

So this place is a decent one. They do a good and speedy job. They helped me on the spot.For that I do recommend them.  However if you are a service member and want to use them to sew on patches or name tapes, they do a good job BUT do yourself a favor and remove the velcro yourself. If its 3 bucks to sew on a patch or a tape, and its 2.50 to remove the velcro.. something you can do yourself under a minute by using your ka-bar/leatherman/sharpened e-tool/hang nail/scalpel/seam ripper/telepathy/edgy wit. I will definitely keep this in mind for the next time.   That's all folks.

This place is affordable, and the eye doc is awesome. Very personable, very nice, maybe a little quick in his examination - or maybe he is just that good, I don't know. So far so good, and I would come back for the eye doctor alone.   The rest of the organization is unorganized and not very welcoming. I felt like I tried to use a coupon in an eastern European country. I didn't have a coupon. The coupon was imaginary. Stop saying coupon.   When I picked my glasses up, I tried them on immediately in the store. The right lens was good, while the left was way way off. I couldn't see a thing. I told the lady behind the counter and she said that it was just me having to get adjusted to my new glasses. I, not being an idiot, told her that it was nothing that I could get used to and that they have done something wrong. This sparked a fire of hatred in said eastern European lady, but she kept it professional.. well kinda, and said that they would look into it. I suspected that I would never see my awesome retro RayBan frames again.  But I did a week later. This time I could see with both my eyes, which was intended to begin with and I was happy. However, I will not be getting lenses from this establishment again.

This is a nice little gem that sure has not gone unnoticed. When I came (no reservations) I had about a 20 minute wait for a table of two - which I didn't mind and took this time to order from the bar. The bartender was friendly and quick. With a drink in hand, it was a pleasure to check out the wines and the milieu of this place of business. It's quite nice, it is however not very big and it can get quite loud in here. Not too loud for a simple conversation, but loud enough for me to take notice.  Once seated the service was great. Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.  The service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be. (But they have unbelievable early weekdays specials) I give this place a 4, it has 5 potential - but then they have to step up the food a notch, and by food I mean cheese.

This is a neighbor hood bar that I only can see one coming to if one lives right by. There is nothing I consider redeeming by this place. They have beer, they have standard grub and standard everything else. Nothing to yelp about ;) It's almost as if they went out of their way to maintain anonymousy if it wasn't the gloom atmosphere with a hint of depression and melancholy.   I don't thing that Gallaghers has a format that is desirable, at least not for me. I have other establishments to force my taxed monies upon.  I had some great company, but I can't credit the establishment for that. I cannot see it in the stars that I will return, to this or another namesake establishment.   They do have trivia. If anyone is into that, but they won't deserve my mercy because of it.   .. und das ist nach ein entt√§uscht kritiker

This is so far off a place that I would call "mine", but it has a certain je ne sais quoi.. and that certain something is the patronage, for better and worse.   The "Happy Hour" is the normal flora of crappy domestic beer for a 50c a bottle. Even I can down a few Bud when it comes at almost no cost, and served by a fantastic blond that literally owns dominates the bar and everyone close to it.  Then we have the diehards in full battle rattle cowboy-badboy-style, and yes I am talking from hat to boots, including vest. Looking like coming straight from the rodeo even if their gear never touched dirt.   Then we have the cowgirls in a more modern giddyup. Gorgeous ladies with a sexy urban-barn-style in a way that puts Daisy Duke herself to shame. Lots of skin is shown together with cowgirl boots and diverse country apparel.   Then we have the rest, and that includes me. I dont fit in, but the atmosphere isn't hostile at all. I would love to go here on a normal night if it wasn't for the focus of this whole place is a bizarre mix between two-step and hip hop. They start out every night with two-stepping, where locals and local talents alike show off their stuff. As the night passes more and more hip hop is snuck in, and the moves gets dirtier and grittier and everybody seems to love it. Could be the alcohol.   I still haven't figured this place out. At all. Maybe I will have to have a few more of those half-dollar-beer to figure it out. (I have seen the oddest of Hipsters here too.. PBR shirt, backward ball cap like Fred Durst, and Chuck Taylor's.. its worth a visit for that sighting alone.)

I have to start checking out more trails around here now when the weather is more forgiving. This is awesome, I wish I loved closer. For hiking this is what you have been looking for... and cool people that hike on the weekend.  What more can I say about a trail head?!

So I needed a haircut.   It was late and I was seated at once, and greeted by a very professional perfectionist from Turkey. True American patriot this young man, and a good barber.   Fellow barber was watching TV and shooting loads of politically incorrect loads at the things he saw there - not that it bothers me a bit, but made me react to it.   He took his time, and he did a good job. I left happy with a great haircut. The price was fair for service rendered.

I must agree with some of the other reviewers, that the place is nice and all but the sandwiches are nothing special. I mean they are very basic, and there is nothing wrong with that, but if I want a basic sandwich I will make it myself. The reason for the poor star quantity is the fact that if I had to choose between this place and Subway, I'd choose the latter because it's cheaper and tastier - and that isn't what you want to hear if you are in the cutthroat making-sandwiches-industry.   I truly went in here to test something new, and it was around lunch and could go for a sandwich (I mean really, when could you NOT go for a sammie.. right?!). Middle of the road. Not bad, far from amazing. I wouldn't bother.   Service was decent though. All smiles and an interest to serve, but smiles and intentions a good sandwich does not make.

This is a weird place, but it was very laid back.. and lit up. For a dive, its sure are bright in here.. but thats ok. I had a few $1 drink during happy hour 5-7, and then I had a few moderately priced drinks.   It was ok, but definitely nothing to write home about. The waitresses was nice enough, and the atmosphere was ok. But there was nothing that ever would draw me back here again.  .. und das... ist das..

I came here and we choose to sit outside, that isn't really outside since it is covered next to the mall entrance. Service was nice and everything I had to eat was very nice, and I had the pot-stickers and shrimp and salmon sushi rolls. The shrimp tempura was the nights personal favorite. The right amount of rice and flavor for what you pay for - nothing experimental or crazy.   Outside has a nice feel, but is louder and doesn't invite for any easy conversation. Inside it is quieter and they have nice tall stuffed seating arrangements, that I did not make use out of this time. Overall it has a nice vibe, even if I perceive it as a little manufactured.   I am having some issues defining this place, are they trying to sell an upscale experience and yet call themselves a grill? Focusing on seafood but having almost anything else on the menu. Yeah, it is a little too eclectic for me - but then again both service and food is good, and I will come here again so I guess the undefinition joke is on me.

I came here for an easy dinner and margarita during happy hour. I had the most awesome waiter named Chris. He was attentive yet didn't try to push anything onto us, you know like many does. He just rolled with the punches and our constantly changing demands. The food here isn't the awesomest, but the drinks are and the service goes along with that.   This place gets busy, even though it is huge but they can handle it. I am quite impressed by this. So to recap; Food is OK. Drinks are amazing. Chris is an awesome waiter. I think that summarizes it.

Dry Cleaners are one of those businesses that you never know what you will walk into. It can be shady and dodgy, with some foreign lady that shouts at you or at an imaginary co-owner - you just never know.   This place, on the other hand, looks professional and they act professional. This gives me peace of mind, and I chose this establishment due to their excellent reviews from my fellow yelpers. So far so good. But I do think they are a bit pricey. I don't dry clean that often to know what the going rate is, but it was more than I estimated. It could be worth it though, its not cheap being on top.

Rocky Horror Picture Show was the cultural gem of the evening, but I will rate the establishment and not the show (I'll mention the show in thee below).   Desert Stages is a classic small theatre, and with my vast experiences with such I must say I enjoyed that nothing changes. Underfunded shows tries to make it work on devotion and passion alone.  I want to become a supporter of this place, because they try and it works. I had a great experience here this evening.   I bet that they dont serve alcohol, due to the hard rules for a liquor licence.. but it would certainly be nice. I just would. I like Desert Stages and will come back.    *****As for the RHPS; it was my first time it was a bit shocking as it is intended to be, but I really really enjoyed it. Moreso than I expected . They had an issue with the sound, and I dont know if I should discredit the show or the theatre for this - but it really didnt matter. This small setup with a live quintet for an orchestra, really lifted my spirits. The actors/actresses had spirit, talent and they looked amazing. I'd see it again! Definitely. *****

Sometimes I get this feeling that it is a good thing to overpopulate a bowl of frozen meat shavings, then add a handful of veggies and top it off with my own improvised blend of sauce ingredients. (Yes there is recipes on the wall, but I always screw up.) I will say up front that this is a franchise, and I really dont like franchises.   /The good They encourage the attempts to increase the maximum fill-level, by patrons own ingenuity,  of the designated bowl. I like that you can make your own sauce, and they have plenty of ingredients.  You don't have to fit rice in the bowl, that you grab afterward.. as much as you want.  /The bad I can't say that there is anything directly bad about this place. If you have walked in here, you know what a mongolian grill is and then you have accepted the terms of the procedure.    /The unexpected The price includes a drink, rice and questionable frozen yogurt (and unlimited refills thereof), but you have to pay 50c for a classic to-go american-asian doggy bag.   Stay classy YC..  .. und das ist nach der karnivor kritiker

I didn't even Yelp this place, and yet I found so right.   Professional This looks just like a dentist office should, only less clinical. Everybody acts really professional and they had me in within 5 minutes from arriving.    Personable I happened to get Dr. Amy and Kristen and they both were was so personable and pleasant to deal with. Everybody in the office was nice and super approachable, easy to talk to and to ask questions to. Even humble enough to give my last dentist a compliment on his work (Strange, I know ;)  Trustworthy I have good teeth, but I know that they could have sold me something by saying that they could have done this, or make a procedure for that - but they didn't. That is awesome, and that is why I give them my very best. I will recommend them to friends and family... even yelpers ;)   There's no other way to put it, I have found my new dentist.

First off, I realize that this is a school and with this knowledge I thought I would try it out.   The waiting room is a sad sad sight. I knew that the low price would bring in some questionable elements from the diversity of our society, but not this weird of a selection. Many old people.  I came on a Saturday shortly after 8, thinking I was on the ball.. but I wasn't. I had almost an hour wait, but I was prepared to wait so that is all on me. One female looking confident and professional came out with a smile and said a name. Not my name. It's a shame because she had everything I was looking for in a massage therapist.   Shortly thereafter a woman comes out, and meekly states my name. I immediately get a bad feeling but I shake it off. I am here as an evaluator and just trying to see what this place have to offer. I ask her how long she has been doing this and she says she is halfway through the program. She asks me if there are any areas I want her to focus on and I say it would be great if she could focus on shoulders and the base of my skull. Nothing odd there right?  After this comes close to an hour of really awkward pushing and poking. It was clear that my therapist didn't know what she was doing, and didn't have the confidence of doing it. She spends just as much time massaging, as she was correcting the sheets, towels and other stuff OCD style. It was really bad.   Another thing worth mentioning, she gave me possibly the best massage of my pectorals I have ever got... but then again spent almost no time on my shoulders, and didn't touch my neck, skull, shoulder blades or anything else that actually needed some attention. (Funny that she asked initially, but maybe that was just a box to check?!)  Conclusion: I realize that it must be hit and miss regarding what therapist you get, and therefore what experience you might have. In my case it was a miss. I will give this place one more chance.

I feel good about this place. They seem service minded and inform you anything they feel the need to do, change, or fix on your vehicle, and I feel that they are not implying errors just to get you to purchase another unnecessary part or service. This is why they get my business.   I had to change battery, not knowing that it was still under my original warranty - Nice!  I had to change a filter, but they cut me a deal on the price - Nice!  I got to borrow a phone charger because I was running out of juice - Nice! I got to watch Steven Seagal movies while I was waiting - Awesomesauce!  So, I came in for an oil change, and left with a new battery and new filter for very little over what the oil change would have run me, plus a confidence boosting inspection of my car.   I'm road trip ready!!!

So you will stop when the GPS tells you to, and you will instantly double check the address. You will question yourself, because this just CANNOT be it. You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like. But it isn't Narnia; it's a really cool looking wine bar.   And this would be cool if this was it - but wait, there's more.  There is also a lounge area where people can relax and hang out and the rumor says that they play live music down here. I have totally missed it every time, but I cannot blame the establishment for my failure to plan.   They have a nice wine selection, and a limited but eclectic beer selection.  I have not been here for the live music, so I cannot say much about the clientele.. but the establishment is really nice. First I was put off by the way I came here (through the dinky liquor store) but now I feel that belongs in a speakeasy kind of way.

Giligins is perfect.. if it wasn't for the insanely inflated prices. this place is very fun, and presents itself as a divey fun place, but the prices on everything doesn't say dive, and it sure isn't that fun.  I love the concept and the way they are putting it out there. I really do. The playfulness, the shot wheel, the swing, their fascination with little people. All in good fun - very amusing. But a dive that serves $10 drinks and $9 beers. Whaaat? That's Scottsdale prices.. Oh, we're in Scottsdale? OK, but still. No. Uncool.   I will come back here. As a novelty.. and I wish I could come back more often, but paying stripclub drink prices doesn't compute. So it will remain a novelty. And I think that sucks. If the prices were friendlier, I would wholeheartedly recommend this place.

I knew where this place was. I did. But when walking down the incredibly stinky alley towards the back, I started to question myself. It wasn't what I wanted. It wasn't what I expected. But it was kind of cool.   The door man takes his role seriously. I like it, and he lets me in. I escort my date like a gentleman and we take seats by the bar to get an overlook. Live music is about to start. The bar personnel isn't to chatty but friendly. The prices are a little higher, but for the ambiance I feel they should be. They even have a few simple rules that could be classified as a dress code. Don't wear your hat backwards. I like it. Only kids get away with that, and this sure is no place for kids.  Another rule is to adhere to the speakeasy - don't cuss, don't yell. I just love it.   We ate a little; we drank a little and embraced the milieu with our fellow patrons. This place is a gem, in its dark shadowy appearance. I wouldn't want to change a thing.   - IF you are into wine and feel you have the capacity to soak in the atmosphere - Go! - IF you feel that nobody should tell how to act - Don't go!  - IF you like to people watch and/or listen to some live music that fits the venue better than your personality - Go! - IF you aren't sure what the front of your ball cap is, but you will not conform to the designed intent - Don't go! - IF you can't determine the proper volume of your voice, or control your flavoring of your language with the salty words that of a sailor - Seek help!

What to say about this gem of fine Scottsdale dining. We had a dinner party here and we did not know what to expect. Our server was eager to get this party going, but we were not in any rush.. in fact, we took in Europeanly slow.   The drinks was very pretentious, and very good. I usually prefer less pretentiousness but when in Rome.. We had a talk to the sommelier regarding the wine choice for all even if we all ordered different dishes. After short debate we made our choice, and it was great. We wanted an Arizona wine, but they were out so we retreated back to a French concoction that we enjoyed in the mannerisms of true cognoscenti.  Strange things are that they have linens on the table, but paper covering the linen. I must say that this does give the unnecessarily cheap impression. Odd for an establishment that take so much pride in the rest of its appearance. The service is good, but a little hovering for my own preference. I was surprised how mixed the makeup of the patrons were. Thoroughly eclectic and heterogeneous, which is never a bad thing.   It is a bit loud in here. Our party could still talk, but strangely loud for such a nice place.. and to top it off we had a party next to us with one amazingly loud woman. It's one of those things that you cannot blame the establishment for - and yet, it affects the overall fermata of the ambiance impression.  The tip: Pastrami-Style Smoked Short Ribs was voted by far the best meal that we tried. Very tasty.

I usually try to avoid franchises, both to frequent and to review - bit this one is an exception, due to the spectacular visit we had.   The service was nice even if there was bit of a mix up when we were seated, but the service never was unprofessional one bit. Halfway through the meal the manager came out and spoke to us, and gave us all $10 gift cards for this establishment. For a party of 4 that was quite nice for me that took care of the bill. (I promise I tipped decently on the actual amount.)  The food doesn't impress me, but the restaurant is very nice looking. That together with a surprising service, that gave us a really nice dinner experience. And that is what I wanted to convey by my review.

This is a super unfair review, but I will try to remain without bias. The reason it is unfair, that I was here with a fantastic group of yelpers and I probably could be stuck in an elevator with this bunch and have a good time.   So, I walked in and headed towards the bar. I assumed this was a side bar, and not the main bar, due to the size. I was wrong. This tiny little thing (not bashing tiny little things) is the entire bar. But I took the advice from Master Yoda and tried not to judge it by its size, and had decent service. Way too easy since it wasn't very loud in here, even if the place was crowded.   So I spent the remainder of the night here with genuine entertainment from the group I was a part of. But what I was surprised about was the chattiness and the pleasant attitude of our fellow patrons. And this is where a place can score points in my book.   Both fair service and sweet location for a dive. Low douche-factor. I will be coming back coach house.

Absolutely cozy, and the best music around. Just a few minutes in I was digging this place. It is a dive, but in the right kind of way. Its small, and I can see how it becomes unbearable when filled to burst limit with customers but I like it.   I did however use the facilities, and I felt dirty walking out. It is a dirty little mens room - but what to expect for a biker dive. No locking mechanism what so ever, but it works for drunken patrons in urgent need of bladder relief.  The beer sortiment for a dive is impressive. I sure liked the selection, and made a few well weighed choices .. and wasn't disappointed.   The layout. It is mainly a double sided bar, that will host patrons.. but there is also a few small booths that I would utilize if I wasnt here for a quick drink. Then there is the pool table in the back that is free. And from my stool I had a view of three tv screens... but none of this is relevant, unless I yet again push the music in this place. I was welcomed by an eclectic selection of awesome rock, metal and punk. I loved it. Amazing place.   If a dive has a good music and good drinks, its a home run for me.   .. und das ist nach der kritiker.

The concept of a golf themed English pub in the desert is so foreign to me that I just had to come here. I had a Boddington and the jalapeno cheeseburger (cooked traditionally English style). The burger was nothing special. Wouldn't have it again, but would have the onion rings. Holy crappers Batman, are they huge.   I kinda liked the style the place is set up, and even I am not aspiring to become a regular I will come back here when I need a place to have a beer and a conversation.. and possible some ginormous onion rings. The service is nice enough and the place seem clean. When I was here the clientele make up was of the standard regulars, a Led Zepplin listening couple to my right, and a girls-night-out table with 4 girls further in. The atmosphere was nice.   Come try this place.

I guess I should only review the venue and not the bands they are booking, BUT the bands they are booking are a great part of the pleasure I get out of this establishment.  /Atmosphere & Crowd I go here for the metalhead kind of concerts, so the crowd is what it is. The male to female ratio is sad and discouraging, but then again keep focus on why you are here.. it aint no nightclub brother. The crowd is nice, but atmosphere is stand-off-ish.   /Bar & Sound The bar is the bare minimum, and that is enough. Prices could be cheaper, but they rake in money here I am sure. The sound isn't the best, but when I read a lot of complaints regarding the sound - I must state that I have been to way worse venues with way shittier sound. This isn't bad..   /Bands & Price For the price that you pay for the ticket, you can see some pretty cool bands. The one thing I think is a complete rip-off is the 'service fee' of $7 per ticket. That's just a racket and is shameful. Just add that to the ticket price, because that's what it is. We all know it.   Overall value: I go here. I won't polish this turd, but then again if you go see the bands I go see.. this venue fits its purpose and fills its expectations. I have gone here several times, and I will keep going as long as they book bands that play my music. (And yes, they still have $7 parking - which is excessive.)  .. und das ist nach der metalkopf kritiker

A   v  e  r  y   tasty burger!  Yes, at the chuck box I expected very little but got a different friday lunch experience, thats for sure. Yes, it is odd that one shouts ones order over a line of waiting patrons to the loud chef in the kitchen - but that just add to the experience.   Weird - a bit Unorthodox - absolutely Wrong - not at all  Then after joining the crowd of hungry, waiting customers I start to checking out the place. Red hot fire that the burgers all are braised over makes it kinda genuine in a way. A bar in the centre with all condiments and fixings, is up for grabs once the correct burger has been fetched and paid for.   As I stated initially, I got myself a very tasty burger and a small serving of very tasty onion rings. It was Friday, so I'm allowed to.  I even liked the crates that substitutes for chairs and makes sure that as long as you are here, you are here to eat. There was a few things that could been improved, (and the ill manner isn't one of them) but overall I really enjoyed the chuck box and I will come back. Oh yes, I will come back.

I was looking for a new go-to-Chinese-Place and after i found Tott's, I will keep looking. I understand what they have been trying to do, open kitchen with insight - I applaud that. Price was competitive as well, I like it. But..  Where it falls is the quality of the food. I ordered 4 different things off the menu, way different - but in the end it was just sticky and quite tasteless. The chicken was rubbery, which sucked because 3 our of 4 items was chicken. The flavors was bland and consistency wise it was just not appealing.   None of my party enjoyed it. Maybe some people like this place, but i am far from a fan. Too bad, because I really wanted to like it too.

I saw Rammstein play here. I am usually on the floor, but this time I was on the side seats. close to the floor. Great view.  BUT 2/3rds into the concert this huge bridge lowered itself, and from the floor a small tiny stage arose from the floor. Right in front of my face. I was eye level with the artists and the were right in front of me. It was like eating awesome-sauce straight from the aluminum tube in comes in.   But that is neither here nor there, because I am rating the facility. The sounds was adequate and it was clean and organized. Just like a great experience demands it to be. I would come here again for any kind of venue, may it be hockey or Scandinavian metal machine music.

Lux is for hipsters.. but for hipsters that enjoy coffee. Here you can come and sit alone on your laptop, taking up a table for six - while looking sad in your solitude. Because that what I found. College hipsters that wanted to sit in their loneliness, but at the same time being seen - because whats more important than being seen right? If you just wanted to be alone, you could go to a dive bar.. but today's ideals thrives on attention.   It is almost that if there was a coffee shop/laboratory where you could enjoy your beverage alone but in public display.. I am not even sure where I am going with this. It is sad though that people rather text than interact on person.  The coffee bar has interesting elaborate concoctions with more or less actual coffee in them. You can have your coffee with milk, flavors and/or soda. That's how it is, and I had myself some nice big flavory cup of something that was sweet and caffeine laced. I would come back here, even if I do not understand the hype. here comes those who wants to experience the act of breaking the mainstream, but joining another mainstream movements that is almost as big as the original mainstream - but with even more rules and expectations. Complete culture fail - but you can bear witness of the unedgy alternative neophytes with their beginner beards and nervous lackadaisical doe eyes.  Again coffee was nice. I like coffee. I hate mock cultures that is nothing but a fashion statement. I also am very skeptical against mixing coffee with root beer. That's just wicked and gnarly. But as its stated before, they have something for everybody and they realize that coffee is also for evenings and not just for the early pick-me-up. Kudos Lux.

I truly did not give this place the full access to impress me. I did not have the Burger Au Poivre II, nor did I order the Thai Chicken Salad that seemed fantastic - I merely drank and enjoyed service and company.   While the service didn't impress, the company did. And so did the overall ambiance. This is a nice place and I do intend to come back here and start an evening. But when I was here the service had quite a bit to ask for. Maybe it was busy, and they were understaffed for the evening - but that is hardly my assumption to make. But with that part of my evaluation flawed, the overall impression is still a good and lasting one.  Another kudos to the awesome bathrooms. Adorable as a memento, terrible when one is buzzed and tries to focus in a hallucinogenic turquoise light while needing to pee.   Soon I will explore thy menu, AZ88 - don't let me down.

I choose to take my date to FEZ, based upon the Yelps it had gotten.  Ambience. This is just how I imagine a new restaurant should be (pointing out, that I am not calling this restaurant new - cos I really dont know how new/old or what is considered new in Phoenix these days). I really enjoyed the interior, even though its geared towards a crowd way more hip than I. Especially I liked how dim and spacey the place is.   Service.  The service was great. Not pushy yet very attentive. The server gave his opinion when asked for it, and I appreciate that.   Food.  The food was good, but in quality and quantity. The only negative was that I might have picked poorly.. I had the pesto pasta and it sounded more special then it was but that's on me, not the establishment. The drinks on the other hand was great, including the martinis that served as dessert for our little party.   The plusses & clientel.  FEZ is a restaurant.. and a lounge.. and a bar, I guess since you can sit at the bar. I didnt see the bar until I left (thats a good thing) and I intend to check out the lounge at a later time. I think this all is great, but it does attract a crowd that I might not blend with.. however, it does make the clientel very eclectic and that is great.   I thought I came for a trendy little restaurant, but got much more. Cool, very cool.

It was dark when I came to Chelseas Kitchen's patio. Very cozy, and very relaxing. I get the feeling that I didnt get to witness this place when it is in its prime, but what I experienced was good, very good.   I never really left the patio, because the ambiance out there was amazing and induced mingle - which was the purpose of my evening. The option to sit down and have a more personal conversation was always there, but never used. Instead I browsed through the crowd silently, staying out of the conversations unless I was called out on being the smirking observer.   The service was not super attentive, but very friendly and knowledgable. I felt very at home at this place, and never that I had to become indescreet to obtain service. I also had some awesome porter, which name was forgotten by the first sip.   The sortiment of beers and drinks is way sufficient. I will be coming back here, it is just in a part of town I dont frequent all that often. Kinda sad, I wish I did.   Chitty chitty .. der kritiker

It is refreshing to come to a venue that offers something different. Not only it si secluded and somewhat exclusive, when one has managed to get a seat in a small booth-like table with no space - but I like it. It makes me feel like I am in a place that is not a franchise (if it is, I don't want to know). This establishment is austere without being uncouth in any way, like a diamond in the rough that you do not want to polish.   The servers are amazing. Personable and friendly. On top of their shit, and not too busy to squeeze in a joke here and there. The beer list is not extensive, but it works. The food menu is nice. Overall this is my kind of place. I would come here often if I didn't have a decent drive associated with it. The bathroom is one coed bathroom located in the kitchen. This is good and bad, it feels odd walking into the kitchen - but I like that you can walk into the kitchen. A feel of transparency to see what is going on in here.   What I bring home from my visit is the service, and the feel of the place. Both are top notch. Yes, there are things that I could suggest that would improve my experience - but i'd rather not. I want to leave this place as I found it and hope that they do not change.

So, after my violently disappointing experience with the establishment next door my eyes immediately fell on this place. I would never have chosen this place myself, but in a dire need of a drink I walked in like a tenderfoot cowboy mistakenly draws attention through the saloon doors.   I will keep it short and sweet. Service - fantastic. Clientele (even if the establishment isn't outmost responsible for this) - outstanding. Drinks - great. Atmosphere - cozy.  I have almost no negatives at all. Well, since it is a seafood place there is a hint of shellfish smell in the whole place. Not enough for it to transfer to you as a patron, but it lingers.. and I assume it is to be expected... just not expected by me since I was a clueless walk-in..

A sports bar in Scottsdale you assume would have a little of that Scottsdale flair right? A little style, a little pizzazz, even with a rougher edge for those who don't fully embrace the Scottsdale flavor!!?!  No! No it doesn't.  What it is, is a water hole for those drunkards that happens to walk by. A pit stop during a switch in bars, or clubs.. because nobody in their right mind decides to go out, go all the way to Scottsdale and go to THIS place. That plainly doesn't happen.   Someone mentioned a smell.. I thought that was my memory serving me wrong, but that is a thing I do remember too. They need to gut this place a replace it with something that is worthy of the location it is in.  Yes, they hire cute girls.. so what, who doesn't?!

This place is great in many ways. The food is tasty, I don't feel its overpriced and all the bearded people working there is nice enough. With that last statement I don't mean that the service is bad, it is enough i.e. not circling you, but checks in with you now and then. I like that. I also like their laid back style, and they're attitude that goes along with a unconformative beard. I like this brand service.  Since I barely knew what a pasty was, I ordered the Oggie, the most basic of pasties. It was good, but I can now see how more elaborate filling is better. Next time I will throw some more spice in there, and yes there will be another time. I really enjoyed it, the whole experience. I liked the atmosphere, and the food... and the fact that they have some cool English beers is also a crowd pleaser, if you are my kind of crowd. So food and drinks goes without complaint.  After a pasty and a couple of beers I was full. Completely full. Sense dictates that I shouldn't have been this full, but I was. Totally worth the visit, and as well as I might not become a regular - I sure will become the occasional returning visitor. I guess I'll end with - come here, support this establishment, not that they need your business - but you need to try a pasty and a beer experience.

(This review is not of the actual Hotel, but the New years Eve event they hosted)  An encomium to Valley Ho.   OK, so it was New Years Eve and I found myself at the Hotel Valley Ho, and I thought it was amazing. People was super nicely dressed (statistically, there's always a few douchy outliers) and looking hot. This was the little older Scottsdale crowd that is OK with a $100 ticket to get in (includes open bar) and they act the part. People were very friendly, and stayed classy (yet again this is an average) throughout the night until the wee hours - when the elegance of the behaved has announced their retreat, and leave room for the belligerent fools as it should be.  Ambiance. Very classy event Valley Ho - very classy indeed. Makes me want to come for the other events like Halloween and.. I don't know, but this will stay on my mind for a while. But what made my whole evening was the ambiance, that cut through the forced swanky wannabe-wealthy, and really gave room for an experience that felt exclusive, chic and smart.   Eats&Drinks. Did I mention open bar? With that said one would expect lines, but there was no long wait for anything. I really enjoyed it. There was food too, but I didn't partake in that at all. Ohyeah, another thing of the open bar.. decent liquor choices as well such as Ketel1 and Bombay Sapphire. One cannot complain here. Not one bit.   Improvements.(?)  Well, the photographers they had could have covered the backdrop for an hour or two, that would been really cool. But I guess asking the people lounging around to take pictures of yourself works too.. just not as well.  In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole shenanigan.. and I will frequent your hotel again. Stay classy Valley Ho.

I have been coming here on and off, but I have always got a great meal out of it. The food is very price worthy and, as I most probably wouldn't make this a place where I would hang out and drink, they have that option too.   I had the schwarma last time, which basically is a pita wrap of the kind that can be found all over Europe. Tasty to say the least.. but I have to get better at trying out their curry dishes, because they look and smell fantastically.   Some people say they have gotten bad service here, but I never have had a bad experience. It's very casual and I must say I appreciate that. As I said, its more a place to eat than a place to hang out at.

A motel that has been revamped to a hotel. As nice as the interior of the rooms were, I feel everything else has been overlooked. As a temporary stay for the occasional visitor, I could stay here again.. but I wouldn't. I would spend just a little more, and stay a little nicer.

I was hungry and this place was close. I expected a franchise, even though I do try to avoid them as much as I can - but found out that AZ Bread Company is NOT a franchise.   I had the Carne Adovada even though it was little too much pork for the morning, but I cant complain. Nothing was spectacular, but it sure was what I came here for. The service is nice, our food came quickly and everybody seems to do everybody's job. It has a nice atmosphere in here.  It will not become a place I frequent regularly, but once in a while when I feel that I deserve a huge breakfast and I don't want to cook it myself. Yes this place probably will be the place I choose.

I don't review fast food places.. but this is one of those establishments that I need to review because of their outstanding product and i am not alone in this opinion. i first discovered this franchise in Alaska, and then everywhere else. It is plainly good pizza - but the secret is quality AND quantity. Their stuffed pizzas run 4+ lbs (terrible measuring system invented by imperialistic invaders and lingers in our society like a bad fart), and if you make that a family size then you'll come home with a 5+ lbs pizza pie that will feed you amazingly aggressively and violate your diet restrictions so hard and send you on the express train to obesity..  .. but its good, oh-so good. And you can buy it early, store in fridge and unleash flavorgeddon in your own oven when you feel the need. That is why I use this franchise.  And this particular store is great because of the mood. The shift manager (I assume) is the happiest guy you meet, and he is quick, witty and happy. That's another plus. try this pizza. They deserve it, and go big - go stuffed, but don't under-cook it.

Smart Fit Alterations could be the best alterations place on the planet, I will never know. I have been here twice and both times the front lady is far from friendly. She looks at you as if you took a crap in the trash can and there is nothing but content in the tone she addresses you. Then again, it could just be that she hates me - what do I know.   - First time.  I asked if they could take my measurements, because I needed them. I even had a printout of the measurements that I needed, even if someone in the business "sure would know what was needed for a suit", right?! Well, the lady didn't. She charged me $10 for a really shitty job and I didn't even get the measurements that I needed, nor was the ones she measured correct. I walked out and literally asked myself wtf just happened?  - Second and possibly last time.  Why did I go back? I had no choice, I was in a time crunch and I needed a couple of pants hemmed. They did a good job, but the lady was less than friendly as usual so I feel that might have been the last time. I mean if I come back and I have another bad experience, then that is my own damn fault.  Again, the hemmed pants came out nicely.. but then again, I don't want to feel uneasy doing business. I don't need a caffeine-hyped Starbucks girls greeting (you know what I mean), but I don't need those 'lifeless eyes, black eyes, like a doll's eyes' staring at me injecting guilt, capish?

I don't always get pedicures, but when I do.. it is because I don't want to touch that flawed piece of human extremity myself. Thinking of the foot as a degenerate hand with piglets for fingers all crammed up on top like Bert's (Sesame Street reference) hairdo, doesn't appeal to me in the least. So if I can pay someone else to do it - so be it. The problem is, that I am very ticklish when it comes to my toesy-woesies.   Coming in was like any other place, but without the overwhelming acetone smell and bad attitude. It was pleasant to just walk in, get seated right away and taken care of. Something I appreciate. Standard chairs with foot bath in the end, nice enough.   But what makes this place a place I will return to, from a guys perspective... they didn't skimp out on the massage part. You know that feeling when they rush and just half-ass the effort... yeah, none of that. I sat there and had conversation while getting a really nice massage of feet and lower legs. This is what I pay for.. so this will be my go to place for pedis.

It wasn't a bad place at all.. but just not my venue. The patrons are super eclectic from very hot girls that look lost, to some coked up military kid that think he is stomping the yard, to some older fellow with his hat backwards slowly trying to advance his efforts into the bachelorette party. Don't get me wrong, as this provided me with lots of entertainment, and people to interact with everywhere is too loud for any kind of conversation.   But, this being said the rooftop was still my favorite, as they had a bar manned with a cute Asian chick that got her duties down.. and a big mingle/dance party that I imagine can be found at a young republican rally. I sure had fun though, I mean it. But will I go back? Yeah, you know what.. I will come back here. Not sure why, but I will.   And they have one thing that I usually cant stand but love to be bothered by.. they had a DJ that looked liked he wanted to audition for RUN DMC, but played the most edgeless, dull dance music. It was sad. But people didn't care.. especially not the coked up soldier. Good times, good times.

So I went to Switch and walked into the back door, that faces Central Street and not the cozy entrance that would have been perfect if it wasn't so cozy. I need to come back and hang out in the couch-filled lounge area up front one day. (Has very little to do with the review, except that it must be super nice to hang out and drink outside when the temperature allows for such an endeavor)  Ambiance Its dark and cozy, in a hipsteriffic way - but the clientele doesn't shout hipster at all. I really enjoyed how they had the setup of this place, and the design and the atmosphere really works. The staff was way friendlier than the ambiance suggests - which definitely helps with reasons why I will be back. Not saying anything bad about the ambiance, because the place definitely is well thought out and designed - it's just that some people can be intimidated by hipster hangouts. I'm not one of them.  Food We had sandwiches. I had the Rioja Panini to which I added Prosciutto, and it was fantastic. For a sandwich, it was all I expected and more. Well done, generous enough servings and very very tasty. The presentation didn't lack either, in short this was quite nice.  Drinks Switch have some interesting beverages suggested on the menu. I tried some and they were tasty, quite strong and for $3 before 630. The only complaint I have is that some of their drinks were too strong for my date, (when do you ever get that complaint) but this was rectified as soon as it was mentioned to our server. I would come back for the drinks alone. (Especially if I can hang out in the before mentioned outside lounge area.)  Service I must say, if any of the categories above would have been negative, it still would be lifted by the service. It was nothing short of stellar. My party had a gentleman that was knowledgeable, opinionated (in an awesome way) and attentive. Yes, he made a faux pas by forgetting our appetizer, but that just left room for the dessert (which he recommended and was awesome). Stellar service, absolutely stellar.  Switch just made my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I can see coming here with any kind of party, it really made an impression on me, and I will bring them business. It had that kind of milieu that makes you want to revert to a more polite version of yourself.

I have had intentions to come here for a long time. The reviews have been suspiciously good, and I felt that I needed to know why. But, it isn't all good so I will try provide the lay of the land.   The good It's a two room bar that has both room and potential. It's a classic dive that gives a homey feel to regulars. They have a happy hour, but it is not needed due to the very reasonable prices on a normal night. Ex. I ordered a Captain and coke, and the lady asked me if I wanted a tall or a short. I ordered a tall and that was 5 bucks. Now you might ask, how much rum can there be in a $5 cptncoke, and I claim 'enough'. This impressed me so much that I stayed for another one.   The other part of the bar have craft beers and I need to check that out on my next visit, because there will be a next visit for sure. The bartender lady was nice and clearly the caretaker of the regular day-drinkers.   The bad I knew where this place was, and when I parked in the back I wasn't sure I wanted to go in. I didn't know if I wanted to park my car here. The people that roam this plaza is of the seedy type and that is not something I like. But this bar has been around for a long time, and I am sure that the area has changed during that time. I will give it the benefit of the doubt.   The unknown I haven't been here late at night. I need to. I want to check out the true clientele of this place, and not just the time-passers. They have bands that play here, I don't know how good they are or how wild it gets. This is another thing I have to figure out.

I went here because I needed a trim and the yelp review said one dollar-sign which to me indicated that they would be at a fair price without any excellent extras.  I was promptly seated (yes, the silent lady), and after a minimal conversation it was determined that I was to recieve a basic buzz cut. While sitting in the chair I noticed surprisingly many pictures on the walls of bald people. Not stylishly buzzed, but plain old Bruce Willis (and yes, he is in one of the pictures) kind of bald. Odd thing for a barbershop I thought to myself.   There is a difference between a barber that takes his or her time to do it right, and someone who just drags it out. I felt that the same activity and area of my head was done, redone and revisited. A surprisingly nice thing was warm lather and a straight razor was taken to my head. I didn't expect it, but I was totally OK with it. I'd be ok w a warning. Yes, a warning would been totally in it's place before razor sharp edge is put to my head.   After a decent amount of time she stopped, and the price was $20. For a buzz cut. That, to me, is quite a lot. I mean I understand that they need to get paid for their services, but $20. Nope, will not return here because of it.. But that reason isn't enough - the fade was nice, but the rest of my head is full of "stragglers".  For "20" bucks I should not have to take scissors to my head. You guys know how hard it is to cut your hair while aiming in a mirror?! The distance estimation is off due to the perceived distance vs the actual, and your movements are inverted. GA-AAH!   I cannot recommend this place. For $20 I can go to a nicer barbershop and get my hair washed too. And next time, I will!

Just discovered this place. I like it. I like it a lot.   Perfect for xmas when one can find trinkets, gadgets, weird little thingsmabob, and oddly looking whachamacallit. I can see me coming back here a lot, and not only for xmas but for any occasion.  Not only novelties, some awesome treats from Scandinavia and Asia as well. And spices from a broad range of countries.

Where students sit and tries to do homework while being visible on the social arena. It caters to the hipster vibe with wickedly strange skinny males in "humorous t-shirts" and scrawny beards waiting on you with content. Sure, I am NOT your clientele base. I don't play the game, and I know what phase of life you're going through -  now shut-it, and fetch me a tasty beverage.. please?!   The idea to serve craft beer and quality coffee under the same roof is not original, but genius nonetheless. The ambiance is anachronistic, yet modern with a soup√ßon of retro. I enjoy balancing on the edge of my comfort zone.  The environment is also ambivalent for both a meeting of a more or less intimate sort, as well as a private moment and yet cater to the modern ostentation of narcissism of the younger crowd. (Yes, I am dating myself AND distantiate myself from a younger hipper crowd of which I have nothing but jealous content for.)  You CAN come here and treat it as a cafe while being glared at with implied antipathy - which is cool.  You CAN come here and treat it as a bar in a sense while being catered to as a outcast - also cool. You CAN probably come here and define this place as you see fit - it might go over well.   In either way, I will be coming back until I figure this place out.. and if not, there is beer to taste and coffee to drink. Win-win right? Plus, they are open in the evenings... this alone is star-worthy.

Sushi, cute girls, tasty beverages - whats not to like?   The DJ could have toned it down just a tad, since I had flashbacks from a car stereo competition from my childhood. But enough of me dating myself, and I'll leave my seat on the balcony next to Waldorf for a minute (ad hoc Muppet's reference).   The Happy Hour is fantastic, and since we realized that the HH was still in effect when we arrived, we ordered promptly. I started of with a coffe drink mixed with vodka and attitude - I would have it again, but after that I probably just order what I like and not go for goofy names of weird mixtures.   The food was awesome BUT the rolls that are affected by happy hour are very much alike, and that's cool. The appetizers I had was all great. Just deliciously unhealthy and tasty. The rolls was good, but we ordered too much food and by the end I was just stuffed.   I will definitely come back here, both for happy hour and not. I was genuinely impressed in a place where I didn't think I was going to be. In retrospect I think I should have opted for outside seating due to the lower volume from the DJ's personal favorite remixes.

This place is nice, in a primo location - dead on Mill Ave. As such it does not really cater to the common student due to a little higher quality, and pricier thereafter. I really like it overall, but the ambition to make the distinction from the surrounding atmosphere does inject a uneasy feel of pretentiousness. That is the negative. Besides that I feel that La Bocca does what it should, even thought it doesn't compete with the really good wine places, nor the really eclectic cheese and/or bruschetta creators.. but they don't need to. Location is the key here.   The baba ganoush is what is on the must-list, and they have both decent wines and decent brews. The brews are not strangers to the avid beer drinker, but enough for the level of cuisine offered. I much rather have a little place with limited ambition and doing what they do excellently, instead of stretching their ambition too thin. Thank you for that LBUP.  At my last visit I sat lounging outside to have a private conversation with a friend while being entertained by the passersby eclecticism and spirit. This is a gem for that purpose, due to the statement this place has on that side of the street.. yet not clogging up the free flow of people and modern student culture that is streaming just inches from your consumeristic haven.  I will return again, and most probably again.

I must make the unfair and inevitable comparison between the Shout House in San Diego, and the Shout House at Westgate, and they are in different leagues. That is just the cold hard truth - but I was still impressed by the Shout House at Westgate. Not only do they use what they got, they tweak it and own it.   I had a great time this weekend at the Shout House. The audience participation was impressively great, the service was excellent. The prices overall wasn't bad at all. I had 8 sliders for $15, and although they were not culinary reinventions - they were perfect grub next to my revealingly classless beers.   Did I say that the service was awesome - ok, I did. Lets see.. no, I guess that wraps it up. It doesn't hit the excellent for their namesake in California, but they sure are a great time out and I sang-along the whole night.  Nice going Shout House.. und das ist nach die heiser Kritiker

I spent my Wednesday at the Keg. Yes, it is a franchise which I do not like, but other than that this place is nice and has a decent Happy Hour.   The service is very nice, attentive and courteous. This is a very valued feature and they should take credit for this. Also, the wait staff looks great in a very tidy and appropriate fashion. The service is where this place wins me over.   The Happy Hour food is price worthy - for a happy hour munch to side with your beverage it is very decent. The Happy Hour drinks include a Orange slice martini, yes it might not be the manliest of beverages.. but it is tasty, for sure. besides that they have some interesting beer as well.   For our big group, this was a nice venue. The establishment had set aside a portion in the corner and that was perfect. We had great service, and at the same time we were left to our own devices and not hovered upon. Overall, a nice experience... did I mention the service?

This place is almost stereotypical for the Americanized Mexican fast food, but as it isn't a chain and since the food was quite tasty I feel that I am wrong if I don't promote it.   I had the pastor burrito, that come with a decent amount of nice tasting pork - and they have coupled this with some kind of pineapple sauce that is way tastier than it looks. As I will not drive here to catch my lunch, I will stop by here if I am in the neighborhood.  Food is good, everything else is kind of a minimum effort - but I appreciate a local business over a franchise any day. So, for what it is.. it's good!

This is one of those sunshine stories, the mission has succeeded in launching their own twist on Mexican cuisine.  /Service When I first arrived I was greeted in a very personable way. I was promptly seated and soon our waitress arrived. Let's talk about the waitress for a second. Professional and personable, and did not hesitate to give her own opinion on dishes and drinks.. neither did she say anything negative on anything on the menu, but that is her job after all. I think the service was great, absolutely great.   /Food The food was excellent. The tacos are small, very small.. like taco sliders, but they are tasty. Dont be discouraged by that fact. I went with the chorizo filled pork - I wouldn't recommend it, but I loved the set up, the presentation, how fresh it seemed. But if there is one thing that is a must to try at this place, it is the tableside guacamole. They mix it before your eyes and you can comment and suggest yourself, and the result was amazing.  /Drinks I think the drinks are too expensive. Yes, this is Scottsdale and you have to accept this fact - but I am saying this because despite the raving about the mixologist, I just wasn't impressed. Plus one for ingenuity, minus one for drink list limitation.   /Ambience Fantastique. No but really, it is really good and the service (as I already over sold) plays a big part of this. They are the life of the atmosphere. But the layout is cool and they have focused on making this cozy and intimate, but not too intimate. They have found the baby bear kind of middle ground.. (you know, Goldilocks?)

So I have been here before, just didn't remember it (strange how that happens). From the inside its a log cabin with an after ski feel - and that's a good thing.  I haven't spend enough time at the Lodge. The people here seems nice, and I love the laidbackness (yes, its a word) of this place.   The bartenders are nice, and I must say I was impressed by the service I received from a Will Wheaton looking gentleman who whipped up what I wanted before I had found the words to express what I wanted. Swiftly he whipped up a basic, yet tasty drink that satisfied all requirements. Awesome.   The seating in the Lodge is cool. Its way cooler if one can be the first to claim that corner seating arrangement, before some depressive hefer claims the 7 seats for herself while she is waiting for her party.. of 1. I needed to go to my happy place for a second to re-zen myself.   Nice going Lodge, you have my attention and my business.

This place have got alot of great reviews, and I can see why. It is not exactly what I look for in my new chinese place, but it is good food and I like the cleanliness of the place.   I had the Honey Chicken, Orange Chicken and the Curry Chicken - and they all were good. Very basic chinese food but that is usually what the cravings are for. I should've tried something more elaborate, and I will next time.. because there will be a next time for sure.

So I went here with a Bosnian friend, that ordered for me.   It's quite a sterile cafe-ish environment. Kinda like a bakery, because they have bread and pastries - but then again its not. It's different, not in a cozy way.  So I was dealt this plate with a huge round bread on it (maybe 10 inches in diameter). The bread freshly made, very hot with a light coat of oil on it. The bread was cut in half like a hamburger bun, but inside instead of a burger patty it was full of seasoned sausage meat. This dish is called ƒáevapƒçiƒái, or cevapi for short.   There is nothing more to this meal, but the bread was delicious and the sausage was nice and tasty. I couldn't finish it, even if I ate on a totally empty stomach. this was a different experience for me, but one I would do again. next time I'd save some room for tasty looking Bosnian pastries too.   The owners was super nice, even if the service is more in a east european anarchic way. You tell them what you want, they bring it you pay. No checking on you - if you want something, you let them know. I actually like this as a guest in their bakery - don't bring your hooters' waitress expectations here.

I came here for a massage and the greeting you get coming in, is far from intimidating and is very friendly. I enjoy their little relaxation room that is very basic but needed to separate the spa portion from the hair-fixing-area. They seem to have a limited amount of rooms and I was led to a small room in the end that probably sees little use, and is not really set up to have a massage in - I guess.  My masseuse was nice and personable. My massage was good, and relaxing - but at a couple of times I felt I was being left as if the lady had her own stuff going on (checking her cell or something). Not a major distraction, but definitely worth mentioning. A nice thing is that she worked on places where she could tell I have issues, as it should be.   In conclusion I feel that the massage was quite average (not a bad thing) but the salon is very nice over all and has an inviting and happy feel. This is a good thing, and something I do enjoy. Sometimes its the small things that lingers with you and weighs in if you'd go back or not. In this case, I would.

Stopped here for a quick pit stop, had a car full of uniformed person ell and that caught the employees attention. This being said, my experience could have been skewed by this.  My beverage was great, and that was the general consensus. The service was infallible and perky. Everything was with a smile.. but what caught me was the phrase "Taste it, if you don't like it you get something else" - now that something I usually just have seen written on the wall with paint in small Mexican restaurants. I like it!  It's all you want/need in a small drive-through coffee joint - I will come back.

I came in thinking this was a dive, apparently I hadn't don my research nor checked this place out on yelp. I don't know why I was so ill informed but with just a few more minutes left of the Happy Hour (and our waitress told us so we could get one of those sneaky margaritas for a steal)  (I was merely here to check it out, before I plan to bring people here)  I felt I got great service, and that the Happy Hour $4 frozen margaritas is way stronger than expected. I was looking around and contemplating how many people I could bring here and still have a sense of control over my party. It remains to be seen. I did not have any food at this visit.   This is another place I will have to return to and investigate more thoroughly, but so far it made a good impression.

I'm not sure I would have given this place a chance if it wasn't for the gift certificate I won earlier this year, but it was time and I was hungry.   First out was drinks, and yes they all are fruity. I am sure you can order a standard non-fruity drink, but their signature drinks follows the theme and are blended in exotic juices. Fruity but good.   The menu is comprehensive and has something for everyone, thats a huge plus for me.. but since I was here to try it out I went with a signature dish called something like Jawaiian Pork Jerk Plate, or something to that effect and it was in-wait for it-credible. Incredible!!  Way more food than I expected, and the meal included a generous serving of pulled pork in a jerky sauce with some kind of chutney on a bed of rice with fried plantains. And if this wasn't enough, they have their own version of some kind of freakishly delicious plantain bread that also accompanies the meal. And it all was amazing. I kid you not.   So good meal and fruity drinks, what else? The service was great. From everyone, not only our gem of a waitress (that was super nice and professional). The whole staff is friendly. Something I don't see all too often.   So what's the negative? Well, since I have to be harsh.. the interior isn't very cozy. It's clean and good enough, but it just doesn't have a date-feel to it. Nor do they make their dessert pies on site (I'm guessing here, but it is hard to find a negative for this place. Seriously. Have I mentioned the stellar service? Yeah, I think I did.)  When food, drinks and service converge in this way - it warms my heart and I support this local establishment to my fullest. Considering eating here - do it. I know that I will be a repeat offender, and by offender I mean customer.

OK, Devil's Advocate Bar & Grill is a package. You get the combination of a studenticos hangout bar, and a sports bar. And it works.   I came in and sat at the bar, ordered a beer and some wings. Actually, I ordered alot of wings. They showed up quickly and they were excellent. I say again, the wings are excellent. The service is a little confusing, because I was never serviced by the same person twice - but the personnel is polite and quick.   The only negative I can say is that it was loud in here, very loud. Maybe because of the football game that was on - but even so a little too loud for any kind of natural conversation.   Summary.  Its nice, clean and have a good atmosphere. The wings are rockin' and the service is great. I will be a return customer.  .. und das ist nach der kritiker.

D I S A P P O I N T E D!  I had long put off my visit to CD, but this last Friday was the day. We arrived and was greeted by a gentleman that I wasn't sure if he worked there or not, but soon it would turn out he was our server for the evening.   He was very attentive and answered any and all question we might have had, even though the answers was straight off the menus description of the same items. But he took our drink order, and brought it out shortly. From this moment he circled our table and frequently stopped by, asking if we wanted to put in a entr√©e-order - right after we have got our very extensive appetizer selection. (I found this very odd, because there is no way that we would been even halfway done with our apps before our entr√©e would have been ready.) From this minute our waiter stopped checking on us, in fact he might have left the restaurant, and we had no service at all.   *Food I imagined this to be a culinary gem, but as nice as their cheeses are.. I must say I was greatly disappointed in the meal; most of all the hyped Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I cannot believe how this is raved about. The soft pretzels are most certainly not baked on the premises, and the Fondue could be made my Kraft. Shitty shitty shitty and overpriced.   *Service A place like CD needs to have great to outstanding service, but I found it to be the crappiest experience I have ever had in Scottsdale. Our snot nosed waited should be fired, and the rest of the eclectic bunch are so inattentive when we tried to flag them down, mainly for the check once we had been ignored for an hour. AN HOUR!  (By eclectic, I mean that it is hard to see who is working there due to the extreme casual dress-suggestion of the waitstaff. Normally I am all for this, because you usually can pick out the waiters/waitresses by behavior and attitude. Nopes!)  *Ambiance Here is the stars! It's a nice big place CD have here in Scottsdale, and even if I think the chandeliers is a bit much I like the layout and the bar area very much. Even the furniture. This is nice on many levels. This is where I give two stars, since the rest is extremely overrated.   *Overall The food is substandard, and I tried all over the appetizers. All over. I mean the Entrees could technically be divine, but then you might have to order it straight to the chef and pick it up yourself. I would have loved to have spoken to a manager about the lack of service - but the absence of service even made this into a mission for Ethan Hawke (if he'd choose to accept it).   I will not come back. Unless it is to have a dinner meeting with a manager.

Second time around, and I am not above admitting when I was wrong.  This time the experience was way different. We had a server that was knowledgeable and on the ball - frankly, she was absolutely wonderful. The whole restaurant seemed in a cheerful mode and there was live music that I honestly paid little attention too. Even our fellow patrons seemed of higher standard than last time I visited CD.   Food My date had the Gorgonzola Chicken Salad, and I had the Chicken Curry. The salad was awesome, and next time I will probably go with a salad myself. I got the curry out, and I expected an Indian curry (don't know why) but instead I was surprised with a Thai-curry. Very tasty and very nice. It is served with potatoes (integrated, not as a side) which was an unexpected approach, but again very tasty.  Dessert was unnecessary after our meal, but I went for it anyhow and sprung for the Salted Caramel Custard. It was a different take, and it looked great. It was super sweet though. Not my style of dessert, probably because I am a self proclaimed gourmand with a texture and consistency obsession - but it is a very popular item, well worth trying.   Ambiance I was so surprised how much I appreciated this place in a different light once I got a great server. This place is still feeding of off its own hipness, but that is all right - in fact it has its own charm. In fact I really enjoyed just being here and embrace my surroundings. (Possibly sipping on a paperbag special)  Service We just had the best service. Our server was personable, and didn't hesitate to recommend when asked. I would love to give her all credit, but I don't want to hang out my fellow yelper by name ;) It made the whole experience just that much better.   I wasn't going to come back, but I am sure glad I did. And I will again, and again.. and whenever friends from out of town comes by.

I was at Mable's last night. It was my first time and love the d√©cor, the ambiance and they clientele they are catering towards. Its my kind of place, and its my kind of crowd.   I could talk about how much I like the bar setup, but that would take away focus from what's really important; the food, the drinks and the service.   The Happy Hour menu is good and has variety. I Had a little bit of this, and a little bit of that. All great. I had a signature mixed drink that was very tasty, but switched to rum&coke due to my mood.   The service was stellar. One girl kept track of orders and separate checks for a crowd of 20 people.. and doing so with outmost professionalism and a smile. I was very impressed.  Not only will I go back, but I will take friends from out of town here.. besides what Mable's is doing right, the clientele is following suit. People were friendly and dressed nicely. Like the way I feel it should be.

My second time here, and this place is fantastic. We just happened to have the same waitress as the last time, and yet again service was great - no complaints at all.   Although, this time my initial infatuation with the beverage selection has been settled - I still find this place classy and enjoyable. It's just nice to sit down in the eclectic environment and drink up the ambiance of well-behavied patrons and staff alike.   I am also a huge fan of the bar, how it looks, works and dominates the space. I could sit and write an ode to the bar itself, but the real reason this place is as classy as it is lies on the shoulders of the staff. Nice, curtious and service minded.. it is sad that I point out these obvious traits, but they are simply not always there even in classier establishments.

I was only here for a short pits stop of the night, not enough for a real review.. but when I see that they apparently hires veterans and have girls dancing on poles - I have to like it. So, I made up my mind to come back here and fully put this place to test. Right now I deem it an interrim 4 star due to the atmoshepe that was enjoyable.    Next time I will try all they got.

I came here to end my night and wasn't sure what I was expecting. First I saw a bar, then I saw a lounge area with a focal point of a fire-less fireplace. I liked it. Very loungy, very laid back. Surprisingly empty due to the fact that it was a Saturday after payday - but then again, my premonitions of people behavior is rarely correct.   I had a drink, and I had a massively loaded plate of hummus. Very tasty. My party was worn out, and besides that I think this place could be a perfect place to unwind. The atmosphere was relaxed and friendly, even if the oh-so-stereotypical DJ tried his best to lay tracks that no one was interested in. (DJs fascinates me - due to the lack of originality in their appearance.)  I don't think I have more to say about this place - it wasn't what I expected, and I think that is a relief.

Reflexology is not for everyone.   With that said, I have enjoyed the services here once and I intend to do it again. My feet take a beating on a regular basis, and I don't know how to deal with it unless someone really get into them. For $30 bucks your therapist (and I use this word very loosely) stretch, pull and squeeze both arms, legs and more (no not that).. It can be uncomfortable at times due to pressure, but if it only feels good - then it's it only for relaxing, not for benefit.   The negative reviews usually are people that didn't know what they were getting themselves into, and for that no blame can be put on the establishment and only on the patron that does no research.   I felt at ease the whole time in here, and it was quiet and relaxing. My legs and feet were sore when i walked in, and felt so great when I left. High returning-factor.

Went to the Canteen for a Meetup and I had a good time. It's a nice hangout and the atmosphere does contribute to mingle due to open areas and smaller seating arrangements. Our poor waitress had to bob and weave between the group members everytime to check or deliver - she did it with a subtle smile.  I found the service to be very good, and the happy hour menu well populated.  I didn't dive too deep into the menu, but I had a few drinks and that went off without a hitch. I don't recommend the guacamole - not that there is anything wrong with it, but it's not like a place where the guacamole is.. you know, just that good.  The wait staff is cute and attentive, I have no complains here at all. The place is clean and well laid out. If I have a complaint, then it has to be that it was a little loud for people to mingle. This can be a pro and a con, because that means that smaller groups naturally develop and that is good.    As I haven't been here at night, but I must say that for a Happy Hour event - this place is to recommend. Absolutely! Now we just have to see how long this place stays open, before it turns into something hipper and obnoxious.  .. und das ist meiner bescheidenen meinung nach.

Who needs to watch a movie like your flying first class? Nobody does, but for those who wants too - there's and establishment for that. First off, their Salt Lounge is baronial. There is quite a few places in the greater Phoenix area where you can have a drink before/at the movies, but none as classy as this. I mean the concept has been taken far beyond the "going to the movies" experience. Kudos to whomever came up with this.   Disregarding the drink connoisseur in me - and review the movie experience.   I will disregard the movie in itself, and also the fact that it was a 3D movie.. because I don't like 3D movies. But the seats are comfy, very comfy.. and you have a little table to yourself.. and it is a pampering experience. I love that everybody that works here is dressed nicely in a uniform way, and act very appropriate. So service plays its part, but when it all is broken down it's still going to the movies. Not even iPic theatres can make me enjoy Dwayne "The Rock" Johnsons acting attempts. (How does he weasel his way into every franchise, Sam L Jackson style? But I digress..)  The difference is, I guess, that if you are going on (trying to impress) a date, and willing to pony up the difference - yes, this is the way to go to the movies. No doubt. Pre-drinks and comfort - Hell yes. The restaurant looks absolutely stellar, but I haven't tried it. It has that Scottsdale-posh vibe that usually makes me a bit uncomfortable.  *** I don't know this, but I have a feeling due to the location, the added price and the establishment itself.. this could be the place where I can count on not having crying babies in the atrium like I seem to always have everywhere else. And I would pay extra for that. ***  .. und das..

Once we came in a nice greeter was the friendly face one expects to see. But this place is a bit strange, because it is quite loud in here like in a sports bar during game night.. but then again people are here with their kids, so they must treat this place like a restaurant where they let their children run amok. This is a dislike; If I go out for drinking, the last thing I want is to have to deal with other peoples unattended children.  Our server was nice enough, a little hovering for my taste - but since we were a fairly large party it must be hard to remember who she have asked for refills and what not.   I had some OK brown beer, and the house tacos. The house tacos was a mistake. They are of decent size with doubled up corn tortillas. Fair amount of chicken, but everything else in them was super dry. Like extremely dry and they come with no sauce, no salsa, nothing that could counter this culinary crime of a dish. It also comes with tortilla chips and a strange icky cheese sauce that defies laws of nature in its way to stay warm forever. Gastropub my hiney, I expect more of a Gastropub than poorly composed dishes.   But the atmosphere, if I categorize this to some kind of sports bar, was OK. If you just need to go for a few drinks with a pal, and can ignore the kids it wasn't that bad.. but that isn't me claiming its good either. There must be better places in Chandler, and I will find it.

So I went here for a featured event. That need to be stated, because it is integral for my conclusion.   As I walked in I felt a good vibe over this place. They have indeed taken a name that screams of some kind of brandishing, but I do not know exactly what. The personnel was nice and quickly showed me where I belonged. This nice approach and courteous behavior stayed with me and my party the whole time.  There was pretzel balls and melted cheese on the table. I am no fan of pretzels and cheese, as many other are, but this fakery of cheese product deserves a mention. It was really tasty, surprisingly so. The pretzel balls was all right, but became a weapon of carboliciousness when paired with this mystical melted cheese product (I say cheese product, because there is no was actual cheese can melt in this fashion).    Then a basic salad, before I had the Sweetpotato Tortellini. It was a small serving of filled pasta that came to my table, but it was worth it. Quite delishious, even if surprisingly sweet. i would eat this again, but not if I was really hungry. But since I started with lots of pretzel balls - it was very adequate.   Dinner warounded of with a Salted Caramel Pudding, and a super lemony Gin and Tonic. The SCP was ok, tasty but as pudding always become blase after a while. It is a delishious dessert that saturates the need for sweets quickly. The lemony Gin and Tonic was refreshing, I am not sure how they made it so lemony (because just adding lime or lemon wouldn't add a subtle sweetness).   So the food was nice, and tasty even if I wasn't blown away by it. What I was blown away by was the service. Our server had many people, and yet was very attentive and super nice. Also working for uncertain tips since it was a featured event. That makes his effort worth much more in my eyes. i would go back, for the food.. but even more for the service. Very nice.

So I came in to the store to evaluate my options since my contract was up. I hate this hip Apple-store-rip-off where the music is pumping and you need 3000 square feet for 15 products. You always have to wait too. Not a little, but quite a bit.. so when they finally get to you, you are invested in the motion of purchasing since you have spent time here looking at 200 silicon cases for iPhones.. only iPhones.   So this slick walks up in his neon sneakers, flat bill hat and think he is super fly even though he is the one working on a Saturday. He is trying to promote Verizon so hard that he is shooting off buzz words like Verizon 4G Chip set - even though I can tell he does not know what a chip set is, nor could he explain what the difference between 3G and 4G is. I know what it is, and I don't expect that this clerk should have the technical insight to explain it, but then he probably shouldn't use the terminology that comes from the brochure that he doesn't understand.  As much as I hate employees that act like they are better than their customers, even though they are working in their gym clothes - I might have been able to let this slide if it wasn't for his save of telling me I should switch plan, something I really didn't want to do, by offering me a promotion that they don't have anymore. This might look like a mistake, a mere oversight.. but this is his whole job! Push customers to get the features that creates revenue.  No Verizon, it was certainly not a pleasure doing business with you - and I would have switched operators by now, if it wasn't for the coverage. Since I have to put up with this crap, can we at least focus on the service then? Next time, is it too much to ask for someone that have a vague idea how a cellphone works, instead of a frat guy that moonlights as a bouncer?

This place is cool.  You order your burger in pieces: Bun, meat, toppings, and sides. (The toppings are plentiful and imaginative; there's something for everyone and its made to order so its nice. Actually I wish more places would have it like this, instead of pre-designed food constellations with awful titles "Hi can I have the "Rock-a-bye baby burger, and the Swish-swash-I-was-taking-a-bath ice tea, please?! And you can keep what's left of my dignity!")  The system is simple and fool proof, and it's not expensive. Also, the staff is very nice and patient, as you can imagine.... some people can't handle given the freedom to choose what to put on a burger, and get stumped like a 5 th grader on a spelling bee that's requested to spell the word Archaeopteryx.  Ok, so the joint isn't super nice.. but you're there to eat a burger, ambiance is secondary. But it still needs to be mentioned that it is basic and filled with retro items that relates to hippies, music, surfing. There is limited seating, but then again they probably optimize for their target customer group and lives with that - and for that, I respect them.  I really enjoyed Two Hippies Gnarly Burger Joint (I even like the name), and don't let the short review fool you.

This is a chain-franchise-knock-off. It's not good, it's not bad. It has the same value as fast food, but a little nice and therefore you will pay more. It's a place I visited while moving. I chose it because I could see it from the Elliot Street. The service was ok, but the food was far from impressing. I ordered the waitress corporate predetermined recommendation - and it wasn't good. It tasted like anything you can buy in the frozen meals section from the grocery store, prepared well. I will not be coming back.   .. und das ist was es ist

So I finally got to visit the Phoenix Ale Brewery. The reason has always been that they close at 7, and usually I am not in this neck of the woods at that particular hour. But I will have to from now on.   Positive  I think the selection of beer is quite nice. I have barely scratched the surface, of the probably dozen plus brews that they serve. Very nice I think. They have Pale Ales, Hefeweizen, flavored wheat Ale, a porter, unfiltered Ale... yes, the spread is fair and diverse. The brew is why I would come back.  Negative There isn't much mystical, cool ambiance here - but then again people come for the brew and not for the the whole experience. I also would love to see longer business hours, but that is a decision from the people that run this establishment and I respect that. But it IS why I haven't been here earlier.   Summary I should have tried the taster flight, but I didn't know they had one.  But the favorite of the evening was the Fretzys Hefeweizen - it is something I could come back for, but I want to go through their whole selection, of course. As this is not an establishment that I would frequent as a cozy water-hole, but I will most definitely come back here to sample new brews.    A glass growler with brew for $15, not bad. There will be a few PAB growlers in my home in the future.

I have to support this place too - I have no idea why it has so many bad reviews (and reviewers with few reviews). I for one was positively surprised when I was here to have a few brews before I went bowling.   The waitress staff was nice and effective. I have no complaints about them at all. The prices here are decent I must say, as the should based upon the location. if I lived closer I would come here more often for sure.   I smelled the wings, and the smelled very tasty - but I didn't have any because I was on my detox and therefore wings was not on my diet. I will have to try them next time though. For sure.  Sure this place isn't classy, but that has clearly never been the intention. It is not a dive per se, but a bar.. just a bar that have some decent wings.. and decent priced beer. That is what I was looking for and that was what I got. Don't listen to one review haters... come check Cogburns out.

Positively surprised. Way bigger than expected, but also way cozier. Inspiration from the original pubs, but on a grand American scale. Pretty cool.   The bartenders are professional, with a little urge to showoff. That's cool with me.. I'd do the same if I was a bartender. The beer list is nice, very nice. Imported Pilsner Urquell, which is chzech pale lager (and has claims for the first pilsner in the world). But I opened with a Vanilla Porter that was great.   I dont know what I expected out of this place, but I expected less than I got. Nice.  I will be back.

How can I not have rated OHSO?!  I have been here several times, but only on the back patio. Its where I find myself people watching and drinking beers. I have had some of their food and it's OK, I should try this place out for dinner sometime.. but so far my rating is all about brews, clientele, atmosphere and service.   The positive.  To tell you the truth, I like it - all of it. I feel relaxed here and I enjoy a place where you can sit down and just unwind over good conversation, because it isn't obnoxiously loud here. It is like a patio should be. The beer is tasty, and there is a feelgood vibe on this dog friendly patio.   Funny story. I sat here with some veterans and enjoyed a Friday afternoon as the sun went down. When I was paying my bill I realized that the waitress had charged me for a drink to little. I told her about it, and she replied with "Sorry, consider it military discount" and a smile. Needless to say I tipped her well.   The negative. The men's room has one toilet and one urinal. This means that there will be a line on occasion. Another thing, that other awesome yelpers have said before me, is that I don't like valet parking. I don't.   In Summary -  it's a pleasurable visit. I would take out-of-towners here for a light meal and drinks before going somewhere else. Not saying that this place dies down as the night progresses, I just don't have that knowledge. If you haven't tried it out, please do.

I went here due to my curiosity of the blend between rock music and the typical Scottsdale venue. Based upon my first experience, this place has potential - unlike the band I listened too.. but they at least had some passion.. no, that's not the word.. delusion, but enough about them.   I paid a cover to see a few bands, out of none I have ever heard of.. and most likely never will. I sat down at the bar and the girl behind the bar lip read my order (due to the high volume), and she did it flawlessly. I was very impressed.   The place itself is nice enough, and I am a big fan of the fact that you can sit outside on the other side of the bar. When it comes to the clientele there is a clash, because the establishment does not attract the real metal fans out there, but instead a glam-version of such. The people that want the grit of the image but still enjoy a decent cocktail. I have a hard time wrapping my head around it, and yet it does amuse me.   Overall I will give this place another shot, because it has great potential.. and since I imagine the clientele and atmosphere changes with the band, I might have just caught a slow night.   *** For you metalheads out there. This establishment does not cater to the metalhead, it caters to the occasional metal listener. This is not a posh version of a true rock bar, this is a fictitious Hollywood-up version of such establishment. For better or worse. ***

So I bought a Groupon - well, actually I just mentioned it and got the same deal straight from the spa. Win-win in my book.   First when I came here I was greeted by friendly people, that took us for a quick tour of the facilities. Then we disrobed, and got a robe and slippers to wear through the experience.   First - 20 min sauna.  I am not a huge fan of infrared saunas, since I am more of a Scandinavian wet sauna kind of guy, but I did start to sweat more than I expected. I guess it does have effect even if it doesn't feel so hot.   Second - 90 min Lomi lomi. I am not a huge fan of hot stones. It just doesn't increase the experience that much for me - however, it was straight off incredible.  It was what I expected and more. The downside was the complete nakedness that the novis can experience. But totally worth the slight discomfort, for an amazing massage that is different and cathartic.  Third -  min steam.  So after the massage (which is super oily) a shower is needed, and they provided us with mud and scrub to get rid of all oil while sitting in the steam. Very nice.   To close it all, we were led back to the lounge area to relax, cool down and enjoy some chilled dessert (that was remarkably tasty). This concluded our 3+ hours at the spa.   Summary. The package as such was probably not something I would do again. No regrets at all, but everything wasn't things I would have chosen - but overall it was amazing, and the massage was second to none. Probably the best massage I have ever had. I will be back, and I am contemplating becoming a member.

As I attended a meetup at Lucky Break, it was my first time through the doors of this establishment. It is bigger than I anticipated and the bar is big, their menu is more than enough and of course they have several pool tables inside. But I wasn't here to play pool.  They have pretty good beer selection, where the local (Arizona) ones are cheap for happy hour. So are several of their dishes like sliders for $4, totally worth it and comes with sweet tater tots. This to me that's weird, but it's a great deal for someone to eat something while sucking down some awesome beers or margaritas.   I consider this place a dive, but then again I do enjoy a good dive bar. Every day they have a different happy hour special, and some days it looks to be a fantastic deal. Since I have a hard time turning down a good deal - I know I will be back here.  They have some music going, and I have no idea where it comes from but it played everything from early Kiss to Beastie Boys. Nothing to brag about, but the music is totally appropriate for the venue. Service was good - we had a new waitress waiting on us, and as she might not be the strongest person to recommend stuff, she didn't get one order wrong... and really that's what matters.  I would never have chosen this place to go to.. ever. But I am glad I ended up here, and I will be back. That is a certainty.   ..und das..

So I had no intention ending up here. I came to have dinner, but without reservation to the place around the corner we were SOL. Someone mentioned that R+D opened up, and that we should try it out. I wasn't impressed but the forced mystique of the modern speakeasy approach. By now I just wanted to sit down and have a drink.  10 minutes later I found myself at a low table, having a mixologist explaining how things were going to work and what I could expect. The evening had taken a turn for the better.   Ambiance.  I think it is absolutely beautiful up here. A minimalistic modern decor together with 2 mixologists mean a personal, even if slow, service. Wrongly I expected the clientele to follow suit, but anyone not-to-uncouth can get up here. The allure of exclusiveness is a false assumption.  Food&Drinks The food comes from downstairs. The drinks are created in your vicinity by aficionados. It becomes what you came here for. If your poison is a solid quality drink that is tasty, interesting, and you are willing to pay for it - this is doubtlessly your place.  - Example: My drink was spicy from habanero in a "holy crappers batman, my eyelids are about to self-combust"-kind of way. But the adept mixologist swung by with some diluent, in my case a juice blend that was already in the drink, that adjusted the proportions for the guy (read me) that thought he could handle more heat than he could. - Ps. the basic salad is the bomb.   Overall I really like it. I will not come here often, due to the fact that you pay more for experience than product, but I still really like it and I can see why some people might not like it. And I have a feeling that the people that put this together had that in mind. Better to please a few epicures that will keep visiting, and let those to whom this experience is not appealing to their own devices.

This is a great bar.. it was not at all what I expected, but this is a great bar.   So, I expected more of a club feeling and less of a dive bar when I walked in through the door in the back that offers no marking of being the main entrance that it is. So, in I went and sat at the bar.. ordering drinks that were more expensive than I expected. But the bartenders was nice and very good, attentive and effective.  The longer I sat in the bar, the nicer and more crowded the place became.. and when I left, quite overserved, the place had risen like a Fenix from a dive to a small, intimate little night club.. and I say this with respect. I did not expect this at all. Nor what I walked into, nor what I walked out from.   While at the bar, getting served like a pro.. I discovered what many others has discovered before me, this tasty sneak attack called the Moscow Mule. Vodka hidden behind mint and ginger beer.. awesome.   So, visit The Little Woody.. and when you see the eyes on the building, its there.   .. und das ist nach der Kritiker

So my house came down with puppies, and I needed to act.  I did my research. You can find way way cheaper doors out there. This is not a cheap door by any means, but then again I decided to do it once and to do it right the first time.  Let me tell you about this dog door. Two thick flexible plastic flaps that are secured with 5 solid magnets each. Again, the flaps are thicker than anything else you buy out there, this adds weight and durability. This is what sold me on this company. That they are local are just a bonus.   I needed a custom door, the with of a large but the height of a large minus an inch. They custom make that door for you without cost. Also, they send a guy with a top locking slider which wouldn't work for me, so the reworked it. Again without any cost for me. The install took about 2 hours. Flawless.  This is a very specific situation, as most people do not purchase a doggy door many times in their lives - but I went with JGM and I do not regret it. Even if it did cost, you are buying quality.   Bonus.  Again, local company. They tell you to save the piece of dry wall, insulation and stucco so it easily can be fixed in case you do no longer have a pet or in case you are selling the house.

Texas people will rave about Ruby's, so I thought I give it a go. Initially my expectations got crosschecked when I saw the long tables and the folding chairs, when I expected more like a smokehouse feel to my Friday dinner. But shame to those who doesn't try.   It is like a whimsical diner, you grab everything yourself and then you stand in line to see your cashier and chat with him regarding what you possibly could want. You order it all by weight and in our order was baby back ribs, pulled pork and the lean brisket. (The reason for the lean, is that the one they call moist - I call fatty.)  Baby back ribs.  No, I was far from impressed. Yes, they were OK but not all that meaty and I actually make better ones in my smoker. Also, I have serious doubt that these were baby backs.  Pulled pork. Was OK, but nothing spectacular. Very basic.   Brisket. Quite nice actually. But not nice enough to just come here for the brisket.  Sides.  I know it was made on the premises, but it all tasted prefab - I was not impressed.  Nor was i impressed by this do it yourself and eat like an animal kind of place. I can see myself taking foreigners here as a novelty, but as for quality of food and pleasing experience this will not be my choice of place. For kids I can see the lawlessness of playing with your food without silverware and without plates (yes, wax paper straight onto the picnic table) but as an adult I find this not entertaining and just cater to those who wants to rebel against civilization.   I find this place highly overrated!

I like what they have done with this place. It looks great. I cant wait to come here and eat. Now, I was only here for the Happy Hour which is sufficiently big, even if it doesnt dip into the real interesting beverages that this establishment has. (Out of cost reasons, I understand.)  /Beverages Some really interesting beers from Belgium, and other cool places. The selection is impressive to me. Other beverages that is recommended is the Monks Mule, a fairly basic quality Moscow Mule mix but with the in house flavored cucumber vodka. Tasty to say the least.    /Grub I had some chicken and some taters that was tasty, even if a bit overpriced. I heard about the house alternative to the classic hot wings, was the hot fried cauliflower - not my cup if tea. The presentation was great, but tastewise it is only cauliflower. Nothing new under the moon.   /Service They are doing well in this department. The people behind the bar knows what they are doing and being curtious doing it. I find that is where I lay the bar and they pass.   Overall, it's not a place I will become a regular.. but it is a place I will come back to.

So I needed to go try out the most ridiculous burger I could and this was the place. You know what, it is more of a kids place than not on one hand, and yet again it is not due to full bar and higher quality/prices.   So the whole party was adventurous, but I went with the PB&J burger Rehab Size w a side of onion rings. So it came in, and I have pictures, and I was impressed. Now the PB ran down the sides and invited for a messy meal, so I went for it with knife and fork as a proper European. It was good. I mean, it was interesting on a novelty level. The peanut butter was powerful, and the jelly kinda just provided a sweet tone. The burger itself was amazing and the pretzel bun was stellar. The 5 massively onion rings was a little disappointing at first, but they delivered. They were huge - in my opinion a little too big actually. I mean it looks great, but the onion becomes slightly underdone this way and provides the crunch to a thick breading. But back to the burger. This place can cook burgers for sure. It was a big meal. I was full all night on this one burger - I didn't even finish all my onion rings.   I will come back here, for the burgers alone - but then I will go for something else. PB&J burger was interesting but will never become a staple. So burger was a hit, the onion rings were not my style. Too big. Fries were good though. And everybody was happy with their burgers.    Our waitress was cute and personable. She gave her opinion on food and drinks when asked for it, which is something I really like. But besides that she was quite confused. She mixed and matched up orders on the bills, and then she lost a credit card - but found it again. Just one of those things that doesn't impress.

I cannot believe I haven't been here before. Yes, the bar is cool and the patio is nice (even though it was freakishly warm last Friday) but what really struck me was the people. I have a little pet peeve with the Scottsdale arena and sometimes I feel myself disliking the patron as some establishments due to the fact that Scottsdale can often be less than inviting and quite stuck up, not at this place. I really enjoyed the people here.   - I have lots of reasons to go back here, but one thing in particular must be to try their version of the already awesome Moscow Mule. I am not sure what's added or changed, but the house version is stated to be awesome and I will find this out for myself.   A negative is that they only have one little bathroom. That's unbelievable. And if the case would be that there are more bathrooms, then the negative is that I couldn't find them. An important thing when creating a comfortable drinking establishment, must be to make the act of relieving yourself and quick and easy ordeal - otherwise lots of valuable drinking time gets wasted in the pursue and wait of previously said relief.   - I will come back, and I will evaluate this establishment more thoroughly.

My story is same as others.. came due to a Groupon, and was intrigued and yet hadn't my hopes up. I learned something this evening..  Food. Absolutely terrible. I knew that I wasn't going to get any decent meal, and this was totally understood. But whoever caters to this place needs to be replaced. If they were smart they would have let someone (anyone) like olive garden cater, because it kind of suits the masses. This was just sad on many levels, when the best part of the meal is the dessert and that is a once frozen big piece of pudding pie.   Drinks.  They have wine, beer and drinks. They are a bit pricey - but nothing that wasn't expected. No complaints here.   Entertainment. I knew it would be cheesy, but it was quite bad. The acting is nonexistent but I can forgive this for peoples enjoyment - but the plot is bad. I mean to the point that they could (and should) have bought a plot somewhere that would been entertaining and also interesting. This is the most boring plot. Absolutely boring. Way more than the poor actors CPR attempts to keep the interest alive.   Audience participation.  I expected some audience participation, and yes there was some. There couldn't have been less.. and the little there was, was dumb. Having had some experience in the realm of entertaining - using the audience should be a given and absolutely free entertainment. Something this venue could have used for sure.   Summary.  For being an amateur entertainment mystery dinner, whoever created this should go back to their day job. I see so much room for improvement in all areas, due to the idea is a good one - but the planning and the execution is sad. Now I need to check out others like this, because I need to reassure myself that this is a low water mark. And again, the plot was ludicrous and not in a funny way.

I like Lustre Bar.   It's a roof top pool lounge. That's 4 awesome words in a row! I have never been here when it has been really packed, but I'd love to see it. I have been here a few times when the atmosphere has been relaxing and nice.   They have some good drinks for happy hour. Good to excellent service depending on the night. The clientele is hit and miss, I guess much due to its dependence on who is staying at the hotel this place is located on top of. Dead smack center Phoenix downtown, so the view is quite nice.   I find this is a place I have to investigate further... and I will.  ..und das..

I wasn't expecting an upbeat little cafe when I thought that crepes was what I needed this morning, but that is what I got. Music going, people smiling, and my belly growling. I have passed this place many times, and never really felt that I was up for a morning crepe.. but it does beat an omelet IMO.   Crepes I had the pesto chicken crepe and it was awesome at first bite. OK, truth be told, after almost wolfing the whole thing down I found it a bit salty - still very tasty. I will go back here again for the crepes.   Coffee Being from Europe, so I have some expectations on coffee. This coffee is awesome. I didn't expect it, at all. A cup of coffee is like $2 and apparently comes with refills.. sweet deal.     You'll be greeted with a smile and the whole staff is easy going. That's all I am looking for in a cafe-kind-of-establishment anyhow. I really enjoyed it, and I definitely will be back here.

I needed a safe bolted down.  ASO came in as one of the lowest bidders but also answered my request really fast. I had some questions and the answers to these did not come as fast - however, we did agree on a date, time, service and a price.   Then it got quiet. I even sent an email confirming the deal. Got no reply. To this very day. I will not deal with these kind of cretinous flimflammers, as there is a plethora of companies that renders the same kind of service - presumably in a better manner.

I drove by this place earlier this weekend and decided to try it. I had the Gelati, I thought they sold Gelato.. they do not! What they call Gelati is a super-duper thick custard (imagine a soft-ice but richer) on the bottom, topped with a tasty Italian ice and then topped with more custard. Yes, it is a strange combo, but tasty nevertheless.  I had the pumpkin cheesecake Italian ice sandwiched between this strange custard, that is too rich by itself but diluted and flavored by the ice shavings it works.. but nothing to get too freakishly excited about.    The girls working was nice, and the place looks clean.. but I am not sure I'd want to stay here and eat it, because the place ultra bright. And try the Gelati, but go regular size.. just saying.

Happy hour at Milagro was nice. It can seem a little pricey of it's not happy hour, but I think that Milagro has found a good middle ground between fusion with a Mexican twist and just another waterhole.   The service was excellent. Nicely dressed staff that addresses you properly and act like they enjoy your business. Ok, at happy hour it was be a little wait for a refill, but that is to be expected.   Locale. The outside patio is super nice. The indoors is just as nice. They have succeeded to make a cozy yet stylish interior and there is several alternatives to sit by the bar, in a booth public or more discretely off to the side. It also feel clean and fresh.  I didn't get to try much of the food, but I did try a few beers.. and they were refreshing and not of the standard selection. I will definitely go back to Milagro, and give it another shot.. not that it needs to be given anything. This establishment stand on its own feet.  Nana nana booboo, der Kritiker

The line that lingered way out the doors from Pub Rock made me question my decision to go see a concert at a small venue. The line sure didn't move quick enough for my liking.. but that where the dismay of the evening ended. Once inside it was cool and friendly. OK, the two major drunks were touchy feely and no respect for personal space - but they were also escorted out before the second band started playing. That, to me, tells me a lot of the control of the crowd this place shows.   Drinks. Beer for under $3 and mid range hard liquor mix drinks for $5. Also the female bartenders were on their game. No bullshitting and no flirting, just hard working. I like it. The volume was quite perfect. Loud as it should be, but not so you had to use those terrible ear plugs that distorts any treble. This is a huge plus.   The security and audio personnel were accurate and nice. The audio people took any chance to hit on young girls that wanted to feel important and stay close to the mixing table. Come on, it isn't glamorous to be a roadie so when attention is given I expect it to be grabbed.. and it was.  Clientele. Not bad. Metal crowds are on average not a pretty bunch, and I know - I have been part of that subculture for more than 20 years. But nice enough and friendly as always. If I could say one negative on the metal crowd this Saturday Night, then it would be that it was a smelly bunch of people. I know it was hot, and people do sweat but come on. This was anti-fresh. I still enjoy your faces.  Oh, another thing on the bartenders. they were very patient with the drunkards.. and cut the right people off. Very professional. I will be coming back here more often from now on. And the Will Call. I usually don't like will call because of the doubtless cluster%#@$ but in this case I have to readjust my attitude. Very smooth. Well done Pub Rock.

So, I had lunch at this place. The waitress was super nice an patiently endured the incompetence, and immaturity that came from my party. Big plus.   I had the boneless wings. The waitress took the order with a stressed smile. When the food came out the employee (not the waitress) had no idea what she was delivering, and we had to guess to whom what wings belonged to whom. It would help if the person deliver would have a clue. Any kind of clue. But no.   I expected a half a pound should do it, and it did. I didn't want anymore. They were not good. I would never order this again. I have no idea why I even ordered from the get go - but apparently I did. Regrets. Don't have the wings. This is all I had, and learn from my mistake.   This place is pointless and would be out of business if it had any competition in Buckeye - but its Buckeye. Avoid reasons to go here, is my advice. And if you can't - pack a lunch.   One star experience.. I give the waitress an additional star. Don't let her go NNY. Don't do it.

People might think that a dayclub at Sapphire is sleazy and this is inaccurate. I had a great time here. There are some beautiful people here, there are some people that think they are beautiful.. and it's expensive. But knowing this it isn't bad at all. We got a day bed... not just the hair, but the middle or the road which is like a bed with partial shade. It costs like $175 but that is a flat-rate and you can drink and eat for the whole sum (they will add gratuity). So we stayed here all day, and we drank as much as we could.. and we ate until we got full.. and in the end of the day we were about $175. Not bad considering we had basically breakfast, lunch and a lot of drinks here.. and good service and quite the entertainment.  The provide free limo service to the dayclub. This is quite nice. BUT when you're drunk and on your way to your hotel, there are vultures that want to take advantage of you. They are not associated to the club as far as I can tell. I called them out on their bullshit.. and got a ride from some locals. Awesome people.   All in all... this place is pricey, and not as classy as they would want it to be. But it is what it is, and it is a good time - even if it will cost you, it wont cost you that much. Really. About 200 bucks for meals and drinks in Vegas. Not too shabby. I will be back.  The only serious negative I have is that it is loud. Way to loud. The music is club music, and they have some fairly cool DJs that keeps the mood up.. but the volume is insane.

Finally I visited this place. It was unplanned, on a whim on a fight night. I must say that I enjoyed myself. I found it to be a more bar-oriented Hooters without any negative suggestion of what this franchise comparison might entail. Modern, open with cute females holding the fort - catch the drift?!  There is televisions all over the place, so tracking the fight was easy. The ladies working the bar was busy (can't hold that against them), attentive and cute. At one point I ordered food at the bar, and the girl took the order and left without knowing where I was seated. Apparently they don't have pizza anymore, despite what the menu indicates so when she found that out - she hunted me down to tell me. I like that a lot, as I would been pissed if I sat and waited for food that never would come.   I will come back the Firehouse, especially if I have a group of people that comes together. I am sure that the Firehouse can accommodate this - and it will happen. Besides this, it seem to have a casual atmosphere and only a modest amount of fire-related paraphernalia. This is good - we don't need anything that can bring us back to the Bubba Gump holocaust of aggressive-happiness forced theme.  And on that note, I think that's all I had to say about that!

This place might not be the hottest place on Mill St, but it sure isn't bad and it is cost-effective. If you arrive early enough the drinks are cheap and the service is nice. The only complaint I had was that I was out on the rooftop (as the whole place is NOT out on the rooftop) and it was quite loud, too loud for the number of people. I understand that this functions as part of the establishments dance floor, but if nobody is inclined to dance, and it obviously is turning out to be a mingle (at least initially) then maybe not blast dance music so loud.. or maybe I am just getting to be old and cranky. It's a possibility I do admit. It could even be plausible. Ok, so I am old and I like to have my drink on while talking about times passed. Regardless, I still liked the rooftop.  The rooftop lounge seems to be a great place if you just want a place to go and hang out. When bottle service starts at $50, that includes somewhere to sit (I assume) a cheap bottle of vodka and a self motivating server. I think it's a winning concept for sure. I haven't tried this prerogative yet, but I plan to.

As much as it filled my need for a transfer, it did only that. So I guess mission was accomplished.  However, as nice as the people that work here are this place gives you an impression of disarray and confusion. I am not sure what it is, but I didn't feel too comfortable in here. Everybody seems to be in on every transaction, and that is just weird.  Their inventory leaves for something to wish for, no matter what you are looking for. They don't have a lot of anything, nor is it very organized. The few guns they have on display is marked with a price tag and the bare minimum information. I mean, I don't expect there to be all information on a tag - but there needs o be more. I would never go in here and buy something on the fly - that just wouldn't happen. I feel like I am kicking on someone who is laying, but this business is clearly not run very well nor effective.

I  l i k e d   t h i  s  p l a c e  ! ! ! !  In fact I liked it a lot, but I must claim that it is a bit overpriced. Not for HH though, and I was here for it. It is funny how you can see what that tried to convey, and by them I mean the people that thought up this place.. designed a laid back atmosphere around an existing building that used to be a motorcycle dealership or something to that effect.   Service was nice, and both males and females seem to be instructed in how to dress and how to act. Dress - hipsteriffic nerdy kitsch, and act - semi-upscale nice. And they almost pull it off on both accounts, and I will not say a negative word about it due to the fact that they seem to pull it of. And by pull it off, I mean create revenue.  I can only talk about the Yard section, which is a roof covered outside area that has plenty of places to sit and it is quite cozy. They have fussball and corn-hole and other outside yard-crap that is very cool, but I didn't take advantage of these sweet activities. Instead I planted myself in a cozy chair and have great conversation while I sucked down some tasty wheat brews. The food looked nice, and they all said it tasted good. I saved room for some more tasty wheat brew.  An odd, but cool detail is that when you walk into the mens room, you see that the.. nope, I leave that surprise to you. I laughed though. To myself, not out loud. That would just been weird.   Come see this place for yourself, because I cant tell the story to give it justice.   .. und das ist, wie √ºblich, nach der Kritiker  Ps. The parking is crappy. Valet only.

Let me give you a review based upon my experience and not my hypothetical expectations of one who hasnt even set foot inside.   I didnt come here to get dessert, but once my party saw this place we decided to give it a go. The personnel was very nice and helpful. When we asked for cupcakes, the woman behind the counter pleasantly said that they dont use the C-word but that they have these bundtlettes or what not.   Ended up getting dessert for that evening, and what a pleasant surprise it was. These bund cakes was super good and I have never been a fan of that type of cake - now, I must say that I am.   Great service, good prices and an extraordinary quality product. I give it a 4 due to limitations in selection, but that is more a indication of how spoiled I have become thinking I should be able to get whatever I want, whenever I want it.

So, I called the place to reserve a birthday cake. I did it well in advance and I am sure I dialed the right number too.   When I showed up they didn't have it. I was shocked and a little angered that they lost my order - but when all came about I had made my order to another store location, and instead they just canceled that one and whipped up a cake on the spot, the one I wanted, how I wanted it and didn't charge me anything extra. For that I am very pleased. They acted and handled this situation like pros.   The negative is that I know I called this location, and I must just assume that the number is forwarded if they don't pickup. The people in the store said this is not the case, and I could be wrong - but I doubt it.   The smaller bundt cakes (size of a big burger) are awesome! When it becomes bigger like birthday cake big, the cake losses its awesomeness. It's still good, but not like the smaller ones. That just a tip!

Ok, so I don't like fast food places, nor places that is fast food places but pretend not to be fast food places. Hummus express is a fast food place.. but not only do I like the food, I love the concept and the attitude of the employees.   So I was going to a barbecue and wanted to bring some hummus. Now, I could have made it myself - but mine isn't as experimentally fantastic as what they make here. Ginger-Lemon Hummus sounds wacky, but it is so obscenely divine that one needs to test it. And talking about faith in your product when you can sample everything before you buy it.   So I bought some hummus... only the hummus, even if the guys behind the counter told me how I could walk out with more stuff for less money if I followed their lead - but I didn't have to. Instead they gave me hummus, and I paid. WIn-WIn.  I wish there was a way I could convey how awesome i believe this place to be - it will not suit everyone, but give it a shot. Give it a lunch.. its like $6. You could get hooked like me, or you could let the world know that you are not a connoisseur of fine experimental food, but a boring old meanie-face that smells of Chicken McNuggets.  If you do take my advice, drop my name.. and they will have absolutely no idea who I am ;)   - A 6th star for the attitude of the employees.

Well I had a great experience at Metropolis and partially because going downstairs and yet be outside, it felt so far removed from Phoenix. We came a little too early because we were hungry, and we had quite the sampling of the Happy Hour appetizers before we felt it was time to order dinner.  The seating arrangement outside is very nice, and quite seasonal I am sure.. but this being beginning of October it was beautiful and with the sound of the water made it possible for very private conversation.  The food was nice, but not as impressed as some of the other restaurants that has sprung from the same people. The curry was ok, but served with a pita bread that put the dish to shame. But the appetizers was amazing, and the drinks were very very nice. This made for a very nice night, and I will definitely come back here..   Our servers were very attentive, and super friendly - which is something I do look for when going out for a bite.

We wanted to try an establishment in Chandler, and was fooled by the word 'speakeasy' in the name. I have been to a few speakeasy places and always enjoyed them, thus a speakeasy saloon was different and a little exciting. All excitement was gone one I walked through those doors, when an atmosphere atmosphere of depression and melancholy embraces me like a brain parasite.   The Good.  Well, it was easy to find and there was lots of room due to lack of patrons.  That's all I can muster up.  The Bad. The Service is fantastically bad. The waitress we had was rough looking, and when I mean rough I mean Gulag-style kind of rough and the style of waiting followed suit. All of us felt she was hostile and passive aggressive. Even when someone tried to order from the bar, the bartender ignored them (probably so they had to use their hostile waitress) over and over.  The service alone would have given this place a bad review.. but wait, there's more.   The Absolutely Ridiculously Bad.  Hair in the food of two dishes. A hefeweisen that looked like it was part milk, part water from the holy river of Ganges. Do NOT buy draft beers for two reasons; 1) they apparently don't treat their equipment and 2 ) then you need to use their glasses. They must have a broken dishwasher, because we had wineglasses that came out with lipstick stains, water glasses that came out just filthy. I am getting sick to my stomach in retrospective knowing that I actually ate some stuff here.   Summary. DISGUSTING. This place is NOT a steak house, and NOT a speakeasy. Bad service. Horrible hygiene. Well overpriced food, that also is questionable if one would dare to eat it. This place have done everything wrong. I wouldn't come back here even if I got a whole night comped. Disgusting place that I hope closes down as soon as possible.

Never even heard of it, but I was dead set on finding this place. It is on the second floor inside the north part of the Venetian, and what it is - is a replica of a dream vision of a dive bar. This is NOT a dive bar, but it caters to those who wants one and yet feel the need to stay on the strip. This place is awesome. I will come back here.   I came here on a Sunday, and just so happen they have a $25 breakfast item, plus open bar until 4pm deal. My breakfast tacos was tasty, and I washed it down with way too many rum&cokes. There was a live band that took odd requests, like "Sing Hotel California in Spanish".. and they delivered. One patron asked if he could slap the skins for a few songs, and they let him up and drum for a while. It was super laid back and really cool.  This will be a place I will return to, when in Vegas.

I went to EVO for Happy Hour, and this place was awesome. One of the better places I have gone for Happy Hour to in a long time. From the gorgeous greeters to the helpful bartenders I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.   Ambiance. This place is bigger than expected. They have a restaurant section, and then a bar with booths and a nice open "loungier" area by the windows. Very nice for mingle activities. I was only here a Friday for Happy Hour, it will be really interesting to see how it develops into the wee hours of the night, and how the clientele changes.  Drinks They have a decent Happy Hour menu that I was very tempted by, but I had dinner reservations so I kept my HH all wet. This being said, they have stuff like Nitro Milk Stout from Left Hand Brewing Company and that is awesome in itself. Nice selection of wine too.  I will definitely come back to EVO.. as soon as possible!!!

I came to Salut with a Groupon. I have heard that they aren't fond of this behavior - but I couldn't be more wrong.  The bar is very nice. I mean the appearance is relaxing and nice. We ordered a wine flight and several of their tapas and appetizers. Their bruschetta is nice. Their tapas were really good. And to top it off, the service was really good and I would even call it quite personable.   Food/Drinks First we had flights of wine and bruschetta, and I must admit that it was pretty tasty.. but the tapas that we ordered came out even more so. The presentation and the taste all was up to par.   Ambiance They really have worked on this place. The atmosphere is cozy, and yet the focus is on the bar. I really liked it, and it's a great place to take a date.  Service Service was stellar. Knowledgeable and personable. The waiter checked on us ever so often with presence, without interrupting at all. We got recommendations when we asked for it, without trying to sell any particulars.   Summary I really liked this place and will come back. I have no complains at all. Go see for yourself.

I went to Salut again, and as the novelty of this place is starting to wear off I still really enjoy this place. They have a genuine feel to this place, that I really like. I enjoy the food, the selection of wine and beer.. but mostly I do enjoy the service.   I started off by trying the Odell 90 Shilling Ale from Colorado, which I might have had before but I enjoyed it. After mingled a while with an empty glass I wanted to try the pumpkin ale they have, but they ran out. Instead I tried a strange beer with a name like magic hat - the awesome transylvanian behind the counter wanted me to go for a super hopy number, but I wouldn't let myself be persuaded.    After Happy Hour I was, however, talked in to stay for dinner.. and I had the Chicken Panini, and also a half of the Brie Hive (so good) with the greek fries. Very tasty I must say.   This was my third visit, and I am still just as pleased with this place. The food is good, but the service is personable and knowledgeable, and the ambiance intimate and mellow, and these are the true selling points here.

I enjoyed my haircut at this place. Sure its geared towards men, and that is a fairly simple accomplishment. While cutting hair, just let the poor guy vent.. That's the whole recipe - not that I am the venting guy, but I do have opinions that I force upon those that have no choice but to listen.   But I got a decent haircut with a wash and all that goes along with that. The hairdresser (in lack of more accurate nomenclature) asked me what shampoo I use, and I answered that I usually use soap that resulted in a horrid look as if I was breeding dogs for fighting. I'm a guy, I use what I have got to my disposal. If soap will do fine for the rest of my body I am sure it will pull its magic cleaning stunt on my noggin too. But she found my skull a but dry, and I did concur and therefore bought something to combat this unwanted situation.   Overall it was a good experience. Would go again.

I have so ambivalent feelings stepping inside WR. I do like the country of this place, even though it really isn't country at all. Not one bit, it is hip in disguise. Alittle hip hick if you like. Contemporary redneck swank, fashionable country chic or Hollywood hillbilly, I don't know.   I mean, I had fun here. But it really is an iconoclast and kitsch ripoff of what is praised as country, because none of the clientele would be caught dead in a real country dive. But then again, I might be one of them. Shit, I categorize anyone that vociferate a yee-haw as a degenerate.   BUT this place is happening and it has some of the standard traits of Scottsdale. One is hot vamps dancing on the bar pouring liquor in peoples mouths for tips. There is a dance floor that mostly contains club-hoppers that too drunk to know what bar they are in. But the overall vibe here is still nicer that most of the Scottsdale arena IMO.  I'd come back here.

My first visit and if I didn't have a GPS equipped cyber-phone, I'd be seriously lost Don Quixote-style. But I did find it and trotted up the stairs to the bar. My first impression was that this is a little oddly shaped establishment, but I have a feeling that there are some regulars here. Dipsomaniacs in need of social interaction, aren't we all at times?  The Beer diversity and level of interest The beers are interesting, but the diversity is skewed. I still liked it though, but two of the beers I wanted to try, they were out of. That quite a lot on a list that contains 12 beers. I want more beers on the list!   The Service There is a cute blond behind the bar, and she is working perpetually. She has no need to check in on you and your needs to quench your thirst, so if you want her attention you need to speak up, flag her down. She was clearly unimpressed by the jokes from the peanut gallery, disregarding if it was an homage to her beauty or a annoying applause as she accidentally displaced glassware into the bar or the floor. I cannot imagine working where people stare at me all day. It would be like working in an aquarium - if we disregard the humidity. In regards to the knowledge of the beers, I didn't feel that I was dealing with a brew pundit.   Conclusion I did enjoy this place, and time just went extraordinarily fast in here. They do have a rotation and will be getting even more interesting beers on the menu, and that will be very nice to experience. But if I wouldn't already known anyone here, I don't feel the atmosphere is such as I would strike up a conversation with strangers in my lonesomeness.

This is a hotel bar, so it has per definition hotel bar prices. This makes this place not up to a comparison with other bars in the area - however with that being said, this place is nice. I killed some time in the bar and had great service and decent drinks.   If I ever stay at this Mariott, then I am sure I will come to this bar. For sure.

I recently went in here looking for a couch. I knew what I wanted and was just coming back to make sure. Immediately a salesman approached me, and I said I was just looking and he replied with "let me know if you need help". Then he approached me 4 more times in the next 15 minutes. This is way too much.  What he did was make me uncomfortable browsing in this store, and I will avoid it from now on. I am totally ok with a salesman approaching me and doing his or her job, even being a little pushy.. but the fifth and last time he approached me in a 15 minute time span, even he must realized that he was being obnoxious and rude. IF I would have decided to buy from here, then I definitely would NOT have done it through this fool. I would have asked for another salesman, possibly the manager.  As it happened, I ended up going to another store and buying the same two pieces of furniture as I looked at in here - but at a better price. Maybe I should thank this nugget o'turd for saving me money.

My house came with some old irrigation that, as irrigation do, eventually came to that point where I needed to patch it several times a year. The only solution was to to a full make over. i sent out for several estimates, and Lance with IRS did not come in as the lowest bidder - but I had a good feeling, since he was licensed and realistic the work needed.   He came out ahead of the working crew, the day of the appointment. We iterated what was going to be done, and where the unknowns were. Shortly thereafter his 3 man crew showed up and went straight to work.   It took about 5-6 hours to redo my whole irrigation, and afterwards it was like they were never there. The only proof was new drippers all over my property, and a functional irrigation system to keep my palms and the few bushes I have. Afterwards Lance came back out, and went over what work was done and how it was done. I actually learned a thing or two about what was incorrect with my original irrigation, and i am very pleased that it is corrected now.   Overall very smooth and professional, and backed with a 2 year warranty. I have a very good feeling about this job, and I will use Lance again when that time comes - hoping that it will be quite a few years until that time comes.

What is it that makes this place so special? I had the Combo Coney Dog, that isn't chili dog..  and it did nothing to me. Hot-dogs are substandard food no matter how much you pay for it. And the chili on top was no culinary experience at all. it made my hot-dog bun soggy. It had no great flavor, nor was in special in any fashion.   The service is good though.. just a little too much Disney over the whole "we're so genuine". I find it parodying true home pride.. and not in a good way. It looks clean but it is a fast food place, and I am trying to figure out what it is that people like with this place. The food isn't anything special. There is no ambiance to speak of. So what is it? They are nce here, they are. But it becomes a theme park kinda thing. "We have all this Genuine Detroit kinda hot dogs and stuff"... Ohyeah, looks and taste like normal hot-dog to me.  (I was leaning to the cheese fries. in my mind it would be fries slightly overdone, a hint of vinegar and topped with some interesting hard cheese flavor. But instead it is same fries w nacho cheese (you know the crap you cannot legally refer to as cheese). I didn't try it. I saw it. So happy i didn't go that route.)  Yes, they sell some stuff like Faygo that is good and all, but all-in-all you pay for a meal that's suppose to reflect something that doesn't really exists. It's a hot dog stand with a gimmick.  A gimmick that I can't even grasp. That is it - and promoting the emperors new clothes is not my thing.   Best part of my meal - overpriced Faygo. I will not suggest to come back here.

I have had the burger again, and last time I was wrong. I assumed things about their cheese, and as it isn't my favorite they are more particular about their quality than I ever could expect. I learned that the cheese is local, a fact that I love, and made by Shrieber Cheese. But enough about the cheese - the final compilation is still a tasty burger. And i have enjoyed it.   I have come back a few times and at first it against my vote, but I fell for single majority. I had to give them a second third and a fourth chance and they have started to grow on me. I do still favor the the burger over the dog. That has not changed.   My hat is off for the persistence and the corrections. After each review I have been contacted by the owner, not requesting me to changed my review but correcting my wrongful assumptions and guesswork, and having a decent attitude while doing so. For this I am truly impressed, this is the way to go and the way to treat your customers. this is the kind of business I want to support.

So one day I went to Conns to look for a daybed. They have some at their website, so the fact that daybeds are not extinct is pertinent to my review.   After strolling for just a little, avoiding salesmen with fake smiles I got confronted with a question if I could need some help and I said "Sure, I am looking for a daybed". The salesman stated that he had a few and he would show me the most cost effective one, as I followed him through the store.   Suddenly he stops in front of a piece of furniture, lifts his hand in a vague 'Tadaah' gesture. Not exactly sure what this piece of furniture was, but it was not a daybed.. more a bulky, loungy piece. i stated the obvious that this was not a daybed, and then he starts to explain that daybeds are no longer in demand and people are buying this instead. As I said, I know that this company sells daybeds.. and yet this fellow shows me what he feels that style and personal preference should head towards.   Once he realize that this is not what I am looking for he asks me to follow him again and takes me to this huge, nice and very plush recliner. He asks/demands that I sit and ask if i am comfortable, which I sure am. He tells me that this is so comfy it could replace a bed. He says that he in fact sleeps in one of these at his house. It is in fact better than any bed. While this is the dumbest thing I have heard all day, and as much as I can accept that he too has an opinion.. this is far off from a daybed - the piece of furniture that I had in mind.   Then he shows me a couch with a "daybed"... eh, then he says 'they call it a chaise lounge'. Yes they do. That is another piece of furniture that is also NOT a daybed. great for many occasions and purposes, unless the customer is looking for.. let's say, a daybed.  Before this fool throws in the towel of his amateur attempt of swaying a customer into buying something that he/she doesn't want, he throws a last effort to tell me how comfortable the bunk beds are. Again, I do feel that the good ole bunk bed has a time and a place.. but it doesn't take a place as a casual piece of furniture that double as a place to nap when the occasion arises.  There is a special terrace in purgatory for poor salesmen.   "O' thee fool of lack of professionalism and stupor I recon thy non compos mentis in the name of Acedia  and, in His vicar, the forth terrace will serve your abode."

This place is quite amazing. It counters the chains by being small and personable. The downside I guess is that it is small. Very small. You squeeze in at the bar and if someone passes behind you, it will not go unnoticed. The beers theat they offer is written on the wall, but I had hoped that they also would have a printout. Then again, if you dont want to read through all your options - just ask the man at the bar and he will hook you up with something interesting.  This place is hard to describe, but they have found their niche. Read the other reviews. Better yet, just check it out for yourself. Totally worth it.

I have a hard time expressing how legit this business is. I have come here for odd jobs, that others didn't have equipment to do, and this guy does it in a timely manner for a reasonable price. In fact last time I dropped a few packs here that needed to be sewn, and he said it would be one business day.. but called me a few hours later and said I could pick up at any time.   That's awesome and the definition of good service.   I have seen the work he has done on shoes, and on luggage. I suspect the result is part hard work and part black magic. I will bring all my business (that fit into this narrow niche) here.   I wish I had more to say, but I do not. This place is the kind of privately owned business I want to support in my society.

Normally I am not a fan of 'the hipster burger joints', but in this case I was and there was a plethora of reasons to like. First off the bat is the fact that they have a very limited menu. Some people doesn't like this, I love it. If you want pasta, then go somewhere else. Want more beer options? Go to a bar. Doesn't want Chloe as a server, well I then loathe your very existence.  So from this limited menu, that is clearly dissected, analyzed and reassembled, I made a mistake. I ordered the Paris, Texas Burger WITHOUT asking it on a English muffin. I should have. I just should have.   Paris, Texas Burger The burger sure was fall apart tender. At the same time as the tenderness is a quality sign, it also make me look like a fool while trying hard to devour it. Innocently presented, but sneaky like a sloppy Joe. I gave up on eating it American style (that's with your hand people).. and resorted changing strategy to one with a fork. The flavors were there, but I would have chosen a different kind of cheddar, or maybe even go with a different kind of cheese (then again I am a stickler with consistency) and the pancetta  - it was freakishly awesome, was perfect as a burger topping and it came in profusion. What I didn't like was the bun. With that tender meat, the bun needs to be supportive, like a good friend during an intervention - not just pretty on the surface. The name of the burger doesn't make no sense at all. What is the Paris representative part? Was it that the bun was ready for an open relationship?   Fresh shattered potato chips This is the last thing that I need, but this is one thing that I will doubtlessly come back for. It looks like a sliced deep fried potato, but balances on that thin edge of awesomely crunchy before it would turn overdone. With this served Lebni which sounds like a east-european car brand, but isn't. Salt and pepper does the trick, but I would love to see a drop of fresh chipotle in there. Or the garlic-cucumber route to put a Greek spin on it. I'd also rename it 'devilishly specious potato'.  Beer While analyzing the beer choices, I couldn't agree more that the choices on the menu will suit most people thus make all sense to go that route. Again I love the decision to stay small, local & popular.   Homemade ice cream sandwich The choice of dessert is a an ice cream sandwich, with a scoop of peanut butter gelato as the buffer in this sweet menage a trois. I didn't like it - probably because peanut butter is not a dessert flavor to me. It's as deceitful as those parents that call raisins candy. It's lies.   Overall Ingo's did deliver. I didn't get to try the egg salad, that seems to suit everyone that had it. My hat is off for Mr Ruggiero, he knows what he has going here. And the service I assume was great, I know I couldn't have had a more informative and attentive server. Another reason why anyone would return.

I have found my new Thai place. I almost didn't go due to the cheesy name. But as I shouldn't judge a book by its cover, nor should I judge Americanized exotic food vendors by their innovative company names. That's correct, we found it through Yelp and their excellent reviews and I am doing mine to reaffirm this delicious Thai place to stay put. Five stars it definitely is.   I had something called like "Rama" Curry (could been called something else, I am going by memory here people) with Chicken and it was out-effin-standing. I gobbled up the whole thing even if I was full way before the last bite was eaten. Coconut milk, with curry with just amount of heat. This has become my new staple when it comes to Thai food. It might not been the best I have had, but in Arizona this will definitely keep my cravings at bay very nicely. I had a taste of the peanutty special dish they have, and it was good.. but not my choice and very peanutty. Almost too peanutty.   Next time I want to try another curry though, even if the want I had was just want I usually crave. Aaaah, these first world problems!!! If you are thinking Thai food tonight, this is the way to go. Its not authentic - its just right.

So if one comes when they open on a cloudy Friday - be prepared to wait. But the wait is oh-so-incredibly worth it. This is, by far, the very best BBQ I have ever had in my entire life. Sure it isn't cheap, nor should it be - you pay for meat, dedication, patience, meat and effort. And meat.  I got the short tour while waiting from some knowledgeable gentleman. It was interesting. I will just go by what I tasted.   * Lean brisket - very very good.  * Fat brisket - absolutely amazing. (And I don't like fat meats) * Sausage - tasty  * Beans - quite good * Potato salad - meh, my moms blows this potato salad out of the water * Grits - I didn't have the guts to try it. Next time.   * House BBQ sauce - very nice * House Hot BBQ sauce - nice w a strange kick to it.  It is all outside, yet shaded seating. Most people seem to take theirs to go though.  These guys have changed the way I view BBQ from now on. I am a changed man. Their product (meat) is fantastic, their business approach could be improved. But I am only here to rate the best BBQ I have ever tasted to date in my life. There is nothing more to say. 7 stars for the meat, -2 for the wait and the basics of everything.

From the outside this place made me doubt my decision to try this place out. It is just not in an area where I would expect a food joint, but I committed and went inside.   This place has the typical kitsch decor, lit with IKEA lantern style lamps. I am not complaining, I am merely saying that these people focus on what works and not pretending to be something they are not.   I had a curry and I ordered to a 3  (out of 5) in spiciness because I didn't feel like sweating this evening, but boy was I mistaken. A 3 was about what I could handle.. while downing ice water and panting like a dog. But it was good. Oh, it was really good. Having been to Thailand, I must say that I have eaten food there that was very similar to what I had here. I was impressed and I will return to this location.   The rest of my party also enjoyed their food a great deal. It does help that it is a family establishment, that runs a skeleton crew. Their product is more the food than the experience, but the experience is the food.   After eating I was heading to my concert, but I really needed a nap.   Tips. * Yes, this is the place. Go inside.  * Remember that if you ask for spicy, you will get it.  #PoundSign

As I walk in I feel a sense and a vibe of freshness, and as I sit down I look around I feel at ease. The server comes with the menu and let me seat myself. Its cozy and and I sit down on the left hand couch. The table is too high for the couch which creates a weird posture for eating. I order a beer and wait for more of my party.  The vibe is pretentious and shallow. Our server, and not only our server, hovers constantly asking how things are, ask if there's anything we need, interrupts conversations several times.. this is not good service. This is bad service. I don't want someone constantly on my ass when I am engaged with friends in conversations, and it is clearly that we are and have ordered both meals and drinks. We are paying customers - pardon me for wanting some time with the people I came here to meet, and not have a fit with the servers.   The food was very pretty, and pridefully weird. It was more interesting than it was tasty and it is clear that the main goal is to use odd ingredients in an attempt to be hip, now and fusion. Sorry it does not work without tastiness. Novelty has a very short shelf life. Pigs ears do taste like pork rinds, no matter what kind of strange salad you bed it onto. And bone marrow.. as some love it, I find it difficult. The taste isn't that great and the texture requires motivation to handle. Motivation I personally cannot muster.   The establishment is beautiful, and I love the idea.. because it is swank, it is on point, but the follow through falls flat. Service, food and drinks are less than I expect to pay for this kind of beautiful hip place. And the price only accompanies the locale, and not the iffiness of the meal. It's painfully pretentious and pricey and I expected so much more. I have doubt that the local will still be here for long, so if you really want to eat here - hurry.

I came here invited and didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't been more surprised. So relaxed with waiting service, a driving range with the casualty of a bowling alley. The fact that you can play games against the rest of your party makes golf a whole other beast - very nice.   I had way more fun than I bargained for and I will definitely return. I like the concept and how well they put it together. And the fact that it was 100+ degrees in the middle of the day, and they still managed to make it comfortable for everybody. I can see this taking off. For sure.  I will be back. Soon. Maybe bringing my own clubs.  (Note to self: Acquire clubs)

Sometimes when you are in Vegas you just need to sit down and eat some, and this was one of those times. This is not your typical american pizza. and I will not claim that it is a classic Neapolitan pizza either, but what I will claim is that it was well prepared and tasty. And for a fair prize too.   So a pizza will run you $10-$15, a bottle of water $4. But the I had a spicy, sweet type of tomato sauced pizza, and the other was a pesto and mozzarella pizza version. Both very tasty.   The negative is the line that you travel as you order, and follow your pizza as it is being made down to the oven where you finally pay and wait. But I have nothing negative to say about this really. It is what it is, and Vegas is alot about functionality. I found the ingredients fresh and the makers honest in this Subway fashion of pizza creation.   All in all, this place will be a staple for me when I need something to eat - and not desire a fancy meal.

I have been to all of the Postinos, and thought that I had seen their best side. I hadn't. The Postino Annex is big and less cramped than the other ones. This is a more, dare I say, European style of the Postinos own style and I totally buy it.   Postinos in general has grown out of its shell, and that might not necessary be a good thing. But if they keep progressing in this direction, I will keep supporting it. It has been said before - great location, big patio, sweet ambiance.   Postinos early weekday deals are awesome, and caters to the students that need something to eat before getting it on, and also to hard working people who just need an excuse to get out and break their diet early in the week. I thank Postinos for the increased chances in pursuing alcoholism, and also for a potential early onset diabetes.

So I got tickets to see Steel Panther here, and I was a bit skeptical of going to a concert in Scottsdale, because it just doesn't jive with me. I knew that it would be more expensive than normal, and it was. But beside it being expensive, it was nice. I like the idea with the balconies on top, and the standing access down below. Must be cool for the band as well.   So the main bar is staffed by girls that are scandalously dressed, but they wear it very well. Cute and oversexualized outfits on girls that can manage to wear them - now that is cool   So we came a whole group. Had a few expensive drinks. Watched a very cool show. And left happily. People complain about this place, and yes it is odd to see a concert in Scottsdale, because the clientele doesn't seem to be the concert-going-type - but I saw nothing wrong with this place.   Will come back.

I had a great experience with American Furniture Warehouse. Their selection was good for me, and I quickly found what I needed. Their salesrep are a bit hovering, but you can switch between them and anyone can help you and doesn't called 'dibs' on the potential sale.  So the purchase was a breeze and the delivery I have absolutely no complains about. They showed up when they said they were, they gave me a call before, and they were quick, efficient and polite. Lately I have had very poor experience with furniture stores, but this one kinda changes my losing streak in that department.  I am a person who doesn't go browsing when it comes to furniture. I come, knowing what I need and how big it is and a budget in mind. This place made all that way easy and that make my returning factor way high. I now I psyched having dinner at home at my table that seats ten.

So I played twice in a week (at this facility), just to get this review right. Or maybe it was a total coinkidink and I just felt obligated to share my impression.   First. What you first have to do as a newbie here, is going to purchase a membership card. You can't play without one (to my knowledge) and it is $5. When you have your card, you have to go get yourself a bay. You can be many people at the bay, but max 6 can play at a time.   Playing. It is basically a driving range turned quasi-bowling, in the fashion that you have a half-set to your disposal and can shoot your ball into different sized and colored pits that from the top are arranged as a dart board - so the closer to the pin you get, the more scores. Sounds confusing? Good! You ball is automatically being tracked from the tee, to your potential score in one of the pits.   But enough about that. this game is a real ice-breaker. Most people aren't that good and it is entertaining to both shoot and to watch miserable swings and hilarious results. And while this is going on, you have waitresses that come and serve food and drinks. Yes, it is a good idea altogether.   Post.  I didn't realize how big this place is. One big bar upstairs with a patio, and a DJ (at least in the evening) and a fairly big bar downstairs too. After we played we just hung out on the patio and had a few drinks and enjoyed the eclectic throw-back that the DJ apparently was stuck on.   Summary.  I like this place, and the idea. It is good for a date. It is good for a few people get together. It is good for a whole variety of potential situation where one need some time to talk, and yet want's to involve an activity while still having access to a full bar. And strangely enough this is completely family friendly.

I used to go to this same location before it became Sir Barbershop. It has changed, but it has changed for the better.   I still go here, as I get a solid haircut every time. You need to know what you want to have done, but for my intents and purposes it works. And the price is not a bargain, nor a robbery - it is good as it should be.   I have noticed that it takes a little longer time to get a haircut here, compared to other places I have gone - but I want to believe it is reflected in the quality of the haircut. The people that work here is nice, service oriented and on the chatty side. I don't mind that at all.

The experience started when my hand felt the texture of the door...  But really - this place was both bigger, nicer and more interesting than I expected. Me and my party only went for some beer and apps, instead of the Dagwood Bumstead style burgers that they apparently do sell. So I feel I didn't truly have enough to give a culinary account of this place yet, but I can regarding the ambiance and service.  I did sample the skirt steak and the scallops, and as not being a fan of scallops - the presentation was amazing. Scallops and tomatoes, on New Potatoes (where do they get those) and kale. It was really sweet to see. Beer list is less impressive than the wine list, but the selection is a great diverse one.  It was a comfortable place to spend a few hours discussing whether to pho or not to pho, if that is even a question. Discussing burgers and hops, and what to give your friends that have everything. It was a blast.   The service was attentive and personable - yet being a European, a little too 'on' for my preference - as is so popular on the west side of the continent. I am more into "let me be, and when I am in need I will make myself noticed". But this is no dealbreaker whatsoever.  A fresh take, yet not that original - I still hope it lasts. I will give them mad props for the Sensei Kreese picture in the bathroom. Very awesome, made me want to wash my hands and then go out and sweep the leg on the first hipster I saw.

So we met up here for a few drinks and compressed socialization. It was 4pm on a Friday, and the inside was almost completely full so we opted to sit in in the heat outside, with the aggressive misty-fans cooling to some degree.   First off, Ahwatukee have needed a place like this. Seriously. And that it is located next to an AMC that has a full bar, make this place now a sweet date option in my book.  Second off, the Happy Hour was totally alright. I had a few beers and the Bavarian Pretzel. Now the pretzel itself was tasty but not that special - however, the mustard that accompanied the pretzel was stellar. Three different kinds, and spot of in heat and sweetness. Beer was beer, I should write a haiku about my relationship to this delicious brew. Stay away from anything raspberry no matter how hot it is outside.   The service overall was good, but our waitress was far from nice. She was showing the ropes to another girl whose name she kept mispronouncing. I felt it was a juvenile power play. But I think that was on a personal level and does not represent the whole establishment.   By 5pm this place was at capacity and a very pleasant place in general. Inside gets crowded, so getting around is tricky... but I like that, people shouldn't be moving around unless they have to. I will be coming back here this summer.

This was a good one. The food was plentiful, the atmosphere nice and the people was awesome. I get to meet some people I knew, a lot of people I knew of, and several people that I would never had spoken to if it wasn't for events like this.  It is the people that make it a successful event. Thanks Hailey and all that I hung out with for a few hours.    The Conchiglie&Cheese was especially nice.
