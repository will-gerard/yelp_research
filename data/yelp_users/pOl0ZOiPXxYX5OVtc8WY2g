Get the English Muffin!  Freshly baked and amazing!  Get anything with an English Muffin and you'll be happy.  If you happen to be allergic to wheat or gluten, don't get it- it will make you feel bad.  Get something else instead.

Thank you Erin for introducing me to this amazing place!   After a long hard week of teaching 25 all-day kindergartners, Erin and I would escape to the land of wine and bruschetta at Postino and dish about the latest glue stick crisis. Splitting the fig and prosciutto bruschetta and drowning my migraine in wine, I'd emerge as a new revived person.   I love everything about this former garage turned restaurant. Great patio during the spring and fall and wonderful ambiance inside. I would usually make a meal out of the bruschetta plate alone, but all of the food is tasty. I can't wait to go back.

Ah, how I miss the table of orange. Nothing beats their chocolate chip pancakes, egg sandwiches, messed up orders and lack of attention to details. I can easily find the uninterested waiters here in sf, but nothing beats the O table's food.   You can find this adorable space in the Scottsdale Civic Center. It is hidden away and right next to a wig store (breakfast and a wig- nothing better). It has a lot to offer including mimosas, wine and eggs. The perfect spot after a night of Lady Gaga like dancing. The wait can be painful, but bring a paper, preferably the NY Times and order a cup of Joe while sitting on their comfy couch.   All of their food is great! The sandwiches and salads used to come with a piece of chocolate- being a devout chocolatist I highly approve (not sure if they still give out the chocolate).   One tip- when the bill finally comes, make sure you double check what you are paying for, sometimes (most of the time) the bill isn't correct.   Wonderful place  *(fine print) must be a patient person to come here....

Definitely thought about 5 stars, am still thinking about 5 stars but am going to give it 4 for the moment. I think I need another La Grande pizza to give it a bold 5 stars. All food critics journey to a restaurant at least 2, 3, 4, 15 times before giving their final critique- the same goes for me, by the twentieth time or so I still haven't had everything I think I could, twice or so over.   Love the pizza, Love the french fries- possibly the last two foods I would have if it was my last day on Earth.

Restaurant or competition for the Gap?  One can't really tell by the name.   Slaughter House? Maybe...  Animal Farm-esque animals greet you at the entrance way, yelling, 'EAT!' They are painted in garishly bold colors.  As I walked passed the pig, I was afraid of an uprising.  Walking in the door to this posh restaurant, my suspicions were confirmed.  The decor, while clean and expensive, looks one dimensional on first glance.  As I sat and looked closer, the sweeney todd atmosphere encroached.   The red soaked accent wall by the kitchen stands out as if it were masking the excess blood coming from the fresh meat.  The rope hanging from the lights, posing as lassos, look  morbid and give an eerie feeling of a noose. And the giant painting of the gun handle fork, piercing through a piece of meat, with blood posing as ketchup rains down, definitely turned me off of meat for the night.    I am not a vegetarian but with the fear of an animal take over, I tried to stick to fish and veggies.   We were met by a friendly waiter with a searsucker apron. The service was good and friendly.  The food offered a lot of variety and was described as a collection of American specialties with shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles, scallops, burgers and other various meats.  It may be that I am a bad orderer, but my selections were not something I would go back for. The scallops were wonderful, the donuts were melt in your mouth good, and the duck fat fries were on par. The shrimp and grits were heartburn inducing and the cobb salad had too much going on leaving me unable to fully taste all the flavors or it just lacked a good dressing.   My companions enjoyed their meal and would venture back. I live in Belgium and will stick to my mussels and frites.
