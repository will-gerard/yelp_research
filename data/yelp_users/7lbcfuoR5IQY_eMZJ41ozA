Doing my up date second time went back order take out was much more happy with the taste of my pizza this time around! Did not taste commercial like or salty in anyway and was please with the ingredients of flavor. I will be back for number 3 Review because I'm a true believer what makes any restaurant or eatery is the consistency of there food.

Had lunch today at Beijing restaurant the folks where very nice but not knowing what to order the waitress suggested spicy fried eggplant plant with tofu and white rice. Let me just say it was delicious! As for my appetizer they consisted of 4 vegetable egg rolls which were very tasty but not homemade. The place was clean and my waitress made sure I was happy. Yes I would go back again!

Had the lunch buffet on a Monday and let me just say before I start eating at any buffet I do the walk through first and decided to just stick to fruits for my lunch! Can't say much about the meat dishes because I didn't have any but overall everything was good on the fruity side! :)

The original fish and chips with fries $12 tasted old deep-fried process. When you walk into this place right away you know it makes its money of the liquor tab I was a little apprehensive but I said give it a try. But let me cut to the chase The food Sucks.. the booze was great the service was phenomenal! There Tapitio hot sauce tasted funny!

This little coffee kitchen serves up a nice cup of joe with my breakfast veggie burrito they also make smoothies, sandwiches, salads and all organic gluten free menu! What I like is the atmosphere located at ASU downtown campus in Phoenix between central & 1st. ave which is downstairs in a little cove across from campus post office. Now the folks are very friendly here and help me with my menu selection and to make you feel at home you can eat on the couch here! I will be coming back to chill and eat!

Okay I have being going here off and on for years and for the most part they done pretty decent with 3 1/2 stars with me. This last time was not pleasant I found tortilla chip crumbs on the seat on the floor and  my table it felt and smelled like it was wipe with a bar rag or worse! I was seated right away but was not acknowledge for 10 minutes and the place was not busy. For me I ordered the typical Sonoran lunch which consisted of a Red Burrito rice and beans. So here it goes... the rice and beans were average you can't really mess those up! As for my Red Burrito it was more like train wreck coming out of Tijuana! The red chili tasted too pasty due to the fact they put too much flour in The red chili sauce that's what gives thickness to red chilies and green chilies in a lot of these Mexican restaurants. The thicker the chili sauce means too much flour! I can go on an on about my lunch but I like to be a nice guy on yelp! My Experience this time around was well below average! let's be fair I will come back in about 3 to 6 months after they get the new cook!

Starbucks store was clean people friendly open till 10pm. Nice place to just sit read and sip on your cup of joe. They offered me a free refill while the young lady was cleaning the store on her shift. All I can say not to many places will offer you that has a clean around you.

First time here at China magic noodle house won best to Phoenix 2010 new times best Chinese restaurant in the United States by cnngo.com. What I like about this Chinese restaurant it's a noodle house that means all the noodles are fresh made here on site they come in different sizes and when ordering your food whether it's stirfried noodles or in your soup you pick the size of what type of noodles you'd like! I had the seafood noodle soup #27 for $7:35 it was delicious it was clean clear with plenty of shrimp scallops squid and fish balls! Wow!! Didn't know fish had balls! Anyway try it you'll like it very good!  Yea!

My favorite place for donuts in the East Valley is BoSa Donuts in Tempe,Az. They also serve coffee and smoothies. Just really like BoSa donuts better than Krispy Kreme's or Dunkin' Donuts. BoSa donuts is not a fancy place or commercialize like the bigger donut makers but always clean and very friendly staff.

Came in for dinner had a daily special #9 Carne Asada Burrito & 3 roll tacos W/Guacamole & drink for $5.99 Like this little hole in the wall on Broadway Street. Was very clean inside the people who work here are very friendly and very helpful with the menu. The place was very nice and chilly must've had the AC down to around 64Â° Yes I would come back and order again trying different combinations on the menu.

Called ahead of time for an appointment they do except walkins. Las Vegas is number 1 in the Southwest for having so many reflexology spas and the competition fierce and affordable for the consumer. For the most part 30 bucks get you a one hour foot & body massage. Having that said let me just say this place is clean affordable and the staff here is absolutely wonderful very friendly therapist that know what they're doing... kinda like thai massage but more Chinese by working your body from head to toe! Don't let the little cute Chinese therapist fool you they are very strong when it comes to pressure points! So make sure to let them know if it's too hard! That's the way you work with your therapist letting them know how you feel.  AWESOME MASSAGE!

Came here for blood work after my doctor appointment. This place smells dirty the phlebotomist talk to much when drawing blood they like to visit and talk with staff and patients had to wait over an hour with a waiting room half full. Look over your options before coming here for other labs.

BYOB!! Okay let me put it down plain and simple Yelpers! Flame broiled and smoke meats makes this place authentic street style tacos like you would taste in Los Angeles. Yeah the beans and rice are 50% but please understand that beans and rice are nothing more than fillers in Mexican food. This place is all about tacos but it serves a wonderful full flare of dinner plates like Chili Rellenos,Pollo Adobado,Fajitas,Mojarra Frits! This place has the pork,chicken & beef grilled marinated and pulled and It tries to cover all bases and does a good job! Eddie the cook was friendly and funny and hopes the neighbors don't complain because he smokes the meat out back. BYOB! That's  right you can bring your own beer and if you forget you have Valley fair liquors next-door!
