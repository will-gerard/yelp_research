I work just up the street and we always eat here for lunch, every time i go in they are always super nice and friendly, the food is fresh and I'm always in and out. Most of the time I'm picking up food for the whole office so one of the employees told me that i can call and order over the phone to make it easier on me which was great! I love going here, i always get GREAT service :)!

Me and my bf shop here every couple of months to get him new jeans, and this one guy helped us, let us take our time and just very nice. I went back 3 months later and i walked in the store and he remembered my name! Like wow, 3 months ago i was in there shopping, for him to not only remember me but my name! That is GREAT service.  The only bad thing is the manger ( I think she is) she is a total bitch,and if your not going to buy something right away your wasting her time. Even though this lady is a bitch. The other employees are so nice, and so friendly i still rate them 5 stars :)

I love coming to this Fry's, it is always so clean. Their customer service people know what they are talking about, and they know where everything is. Its also easy to find an employee when i have question, i don't have to go hunting around to find someone. I love this Fry's!

I had been a member for just going on 6 months or so and they told me that i could no longer keep my lotions there anymore unless i buy the ones they sold. I use to work at a tanning salon so I dont need to buy lotions i have sooo much to last me forever. One of the girls that i talked to explained the reasoning behind it and said that they would give me and my boyfriend ( who also tans there) some free upgrades for understanding, and being good customers.   a few days later i came in and my bf wanted to use one of his upgrades and they were like you dont have any, it was busy so we didnt want to say anything at the time and we just came back later.   when i talked to them i told the story and said i was just confused on way we didnt get any upgrades. and the owner started to get mad and talking to me like i was a stupid little girl ( im 19, i have worked at a tanning salon before i no have shit runs) he then said no other salon holds customers lotion and then tryed to say that sunchain even charges you to hold them,  A- i worked at sunchain, thats NOT true they hold all customers lotions B. furture sun and darque tan both hold your lotions for free  so then he hands me and my boyfriend two slips saying you need to cancel you membership, i no longer want you guys tanning here!   ino i have NEVER had an owner be soo rude to a customer and tell them to cancel, i was shocked! so now i will have to find a new salon to tan at.

I have lived here for about 5 months, the place is okay i guess, the ground are clean which I like, but the staff seems kinda disorganized.. they got our move in dates wrong which thank god I'm an early mover and didn't wait to the last min, then when we FINALLY moved in, we got a different apt than we were showed originally. The linen closet has a big freakin heater tank in it. Which okay whatever i guess is not that big of a deal but then I found out we pay more for our water because its not divided out between everyone else. Also EVERYTHING breaks our shower has broken twice, the closet light broke out the wall, the bathroom light fell out of the wall, the kitchen stove and the washer has all broke from the time we moved in (Last May). the only reason i give it 2 stars is because i do know there are a lot worse apartments out there but still my house is falling apart! When I go in the office i feel they always try and rush me out because i can finish my questions its really annoying. So be careful when looking at these apartments when looking for a place to live.

I brought my bf with me to Jamba Juice and he had never been, the girl behind the counter was very nice, helped my boyfriend find something that he would like. Her name was Ashley i would have thought she a manger, she had GREAT customer service come to find out that she is only 16! I have never meet someone so young that has such great customer service! She knew what she was talking about, and  made our drinks perfect! I hope a manager sees this post and she gets the recognition she deserves :)

This place was the worst place to EVER live! I lived here from Aug 2010 to may 2011, i was always in the office see when the grates would be fixed?? the office always gave me the run around very rude. You would think after the gun shoots, assaults, and car break ins that they would fix the gates but nope and to this day they still aren't fixed. When we moved in they said they would be fixed in a week and they lied.  Also the gym is huge but NONE of the equipment works! living here was SO gross! nothing worked our neighbors are Mexican thugs doing drug cat calling at anything that walks it was gross. I hated living here!    But the worst part was a few weeks ago we get a call from collections saying we owe Scottsdale Springs $300 bucks over 10 months after moving out! I called them up like wtf, and they were SO rude said too bad pay it or your credit score will hurt, we even gave a fowarding address and we NEVER got a letter in the mail about any damages. They claim we never gave them a forwarding address which is bull.   I really hope people read these reviews i would hate to see anyone else scammed by this god awful company!

I love coming to this location for there mystic tans, they are by far the best booth that will tan you! Every time i go and get a mystic i do a level 3 and i never come out orange or discolored. Its always a nice even spray tan which i LOVE! also i always see the same girl working but she is so nice and friendly, i never feel like i am being up sold anything. She always remembers my name and is all around nice :) Also the tanning is pretty cheap and mystics are only $25, but they always have deals everyone month like 2 sprays for 30 or whatever.

I love Chipotle but I'm giving them five stars not on their food but on their service! I went there a few days ago and the guy checking us out was so nice and helpful! He was very friendly and even though they were busy ( it was lunch time so everyone was there) i didn't feel like he was rushing me out the door just very friendly. :) I love seeing good service I think that is big thing a lot of businesses miss! so props to Chipotle ! :)

Just had to pick up some stamps and i was with my mom waited in line for like 5-10mins. Once we got to the teller we asked for a roll of stamps and post card stamps.   The employee was being a bitch and complaining that she had to go to the back and get more stamps (then go get them and stop complaining) . My mom asked can we get some Eco friendly stamps, the employee rolled her eyes and said they do not have that. Then i asked if they had something more colorful or fancy because i was sending out business letters. My mom told her some statistic of people opening letters with colorful stamps the employee said "ya right, i doubt that"! OMG talk about rude, like I'm sorry you hate your job but do not take it out on me! She kept making rude comments about how that is dumb and would not work, like whatever just sell me the damn stamps! I never thought i would be so pissed to the post office!

Me and my boyfriend went here for lunch thought we would try something new, its very much like Chipotle but I would say way better, the food tasted so fresh, way fresher than Chipotle.   Dont get me wrong im a big fan of Chipotle but this place was very mom and pa store, the employees very friendly,and there was not a huge line like at Chipotle. Overall I loved it :)

When I first heard of Spotted Donkey I thought it was going to be gross but I went there on a date with my boyfriend and we had the best waiter, told us about some of the most popular dishes they had. We went with something that that waiter told us about and it was SOOO good. Overall we had a great time, every nice environment. :)

I was in here just the other day and i was shocked on how rude these people are! I mean the employees are always super bitchy and never help you but yesterday they must have all been PMSing.  I went in with just 1 small bag of clothes, when i walked in no one greeted me, i sign my name and waited for someone to take my bag. and i waited and waited and waited.! There were at least 5 employees behind the desk not even bothering to say can i help you. And to make things worse the manger was behind the desk talking to one of the employees! LIKE HELLO really, maybe you wouldn't have such an over packed store if you paid any attention to the people walking in! And lets get real their job is not that hard you sort clothes all day which may suck but pretend you care. I ending up leaving, and still no one said a word to me!  I will NEVER go back to that dump, train your employees on customer service!

This place was horrible! I walk in and no one is there, and the guy behind the counter doesn't even look at me and gets on his cell phone and starts talking to someone. um like HELLO you have a customer?? He didn't even say, hold on ill be right with you, i stood there for about 5 min and then just left. the guy didn't even make a move to indicate that he was going to help me. I have no idea what the food taste like and i don't even care, they need to learn some customer service!

I work for Good Faith Casting and I have worked with Gail (owner) for over 3 years now! Gail is so professional and friendly! She runs a great agency, and really works for her talent. Check out AMAM's Facebook page, she does a great job keeping the talent informed on what is going on in the industry. On the topic of Facebook, Gail is really into social media and does a great job at it, (Twitter, Pinterest, and Linkedin), I cant say enough great things, about Arizona Model Actor Management and Gail! :)
