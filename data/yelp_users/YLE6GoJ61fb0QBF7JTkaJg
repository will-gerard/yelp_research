Joining me for a Phoenix Suns and AZ D-Backs game, you will find me at Alice Cooperstown.  It's a great blend of sports and music!!  This place is "off the hizzle~zizzle" when it comes to a great place to meet friends prior to and after a game in Downtown Phoenix.  It's a unique combination of quality bar style food with an energetic atmosphere.  Their service is good.  Everyone that works here is all done up in their best face paint "Alla Alice Cooper-esque" and the walls are full of memorabilia from both Randy Johnson and Alice Cooper creating one of the most unique places in the city to dine and drink. Seating is available both inside and on their patio.  They have a court yard too where bands play and for unique events.  Their food again is good but remember it's primarily a sports bar.  I've had "The Big Unit" Hot Dog with all the trimmings as seen on Man vs Food.  It's surprisingly good and a great thing to share with a couple of friends.  The whole place yells out "THE BIG UNIT" when it's served.  It made me feel somewhat "manly" more so than usual :-)    I recommend their BBQ chicken, Tommy's Cali Burger and their "no more Mr. Nice guy ~ chipotle chicken pasta ~ Yum!  They also offer a low carb menu for those healthy eaters if you can believe that.  Food = 4 Service = 4 Great time to have with friends = 5!!  I hope to see you there sometime before or after a Sun's or D-Backs game!

Scott's Generations Restaurant & Deli is probably the best delicatessen in the Phoenix market!  They are conveniently located at North 7th Street and Missouri and a strip center with an Ace Hardware and Basha's.  I met some Yelper's friends, Rand H., Robyn N., and Mike C. for a UYE some weeks ago here for lunch.  The restaurant is bigger than what it looks like from the outside.  It's a very clean place with plenty of celeb pics on walls from their prior visits to Scott's.    The service was very good.  Our server was exceptional at keeping our drinks filled and serving.    I had a hot pastrami on rye with a side or potato salad and coleslaw.  The pastrami sandwich was HUGE and it rated a 7 on a 1-5 scale for taste!!  I bet it weighed over 1lb by it's self.  It was full of pastrami-goodness with a hint of dressing that tasted fantastic!  It was one of the best pastrami sandwiches I've had.  The potato salad was not the same "rock star" status with a somewhat bland taste and it was too runny.  The coleslaw was not bad but not great and it played a better accompaniment to the delicious pastrami sandwich which was the "rock star".  I topped it off with a huge glass of iced tea and I was full for two days afterwards :-)  If you're looking for a really good deli, this is the place!  I look forward to visiting Scott's Generations again soon and try their smoke white fish or belly lox.  I will probably take some pastrami to go ~ it's that good.  I hope to see you there!

Coup Des Tartes is a solid 4 stars with the potential of being 5 stars with a few menu updates.  After reading some of the Yelper reviews I was a bit perplexed about what to expect when a friend invited me to join him at Coup Des Tartes.  After h told me this is a BYO, pas de probleme ~ you can count me in!!   First off, there are not enough fine dinning BYO places in Phoenix!  PLEASE HELP ME SPREAD THIS THROUGHOUT THE VALLEY!!  It's a "good time" when you're able to bring your favorite wines with you to dine and not pay the restaurant's prices.  Especially when it's at a place that offers quality food and service at reasonable prices.   Sure there is a "cork fee", but I look at it this way ~ I would rather pay $9 for the "cork fee" and $30 for a bottle of Chateau La Galiane Cabernet Sauvignon I can buy at Total Wine, which would cost $100 (plus) at any other fining dinning restaurant.   Their food and drink pricing is very reasonable considering the quality and taste. This is where I think CDT has an opportunity to improve.  They have a limited menu and since they are a French restaurant, they should think about offering some of the more updated French dishes.  A stereotypical French meal is heavy in saturated fats; heavy creams and butter which are staples in many French dishes and what CDT offers is no different.  Think about offering some of the newer French style dishes that include crepes, more game meats and sea food dishes.  Appetizer~ their delicious three onion Tart and it was excellent! (sweet and savory and decadent).  We also had the Mate Horn and the Mozzarella and Tomato Salad which was very good.   Entrees~ the Filet Mignon, cooked mid-rare of course with sides of mashed potatoes and haricots verts.  I had their signature dish: the Lamb Shank.  It was extremely meaty, "fall off the bone" tender. The couscous was very fresh and it had just the right amount of veggies and sauce to pull everything together.    Desert~ Pumpkin Tarte and fresh cup of French café.  It was also very good.    Service~ exceptional.  They were extremely attentive and very friendly, but not too friendly if you know what I mean...  They brought us a wine decanter and an aerator without asking.  The place is very quaint with somewhat of a homely feel and yet very simple in décor.   Wine~ FANTASTIQUE!  Will plan to bring a second bottle next time!

Wow, great experience!  T. Cook's restaurant located in the royal Palms Resort and Spa in Phoenix is a beautiful place to wine and dine. Their colonial Spanish architecture with a Mediterranean flair is both elegant and romantic.  The Resort and Restaurant are both decorated with hardwoods and cherry woods everywhere with and hand-painted Italian frescoes and beautiful floral arrangements throughout.  The unfortunate thing about my visit, I was there for a business dinner... lol  The service from start to finish was outstanding.  The bar was fairly busy mixed with Resort guest and people like us just their to dine.  The servers were very attentive and we got our food fairly fast considering the type of restaurant.  The Sommelier was knowledgeable and eager to help us find the right wines to go with our meals. Excellent service all around.  I started my dinning experience with a glass of Chardonnay and Pear and organic mixed green salad.  It was good but I was expecting the pear to be grilled.  For the entree I had a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon recommended by the Sommelier, to go with my New York Strip. I added a side of roasted brussel sprouts with duck confit which was outstanding!  My steak was cooked extremely well and delicious.  I did not have room for desert, but made room for a cup of coffee, which was very good as well.   My next visit to T. Cooks I plan to bring my lovely bride and have the pan roasted halibut with herb potatoes and local veggies cooked in a red wine butter sauce, YUM!!  It looked really good from across the table : )  I recommend T. Cooks the next time you are planning a nice dinner for two or with some good friends wanting to have a great evening together.  Their wine selection is good and they have an Oktoberfest menu for you German Food fanatics.

Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.    We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a "must come back" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!  Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!    However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!    Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!    Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!!   Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.  All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there.

You will be challenged to find a better, more experience watch repair than this one.  He has a lot of experience, reliable and very reasonable.  Whether it's a simple battery replacement or repair to a watch and some jewelry, this is a terrific place.

What a nice little "gem of a restaurant" to answer our craving for Asian  food!  Thanks Yelpers!!!  The food and service at this place are China-licious!  The prices are just $, a bargain!  The Dragon Palace is tucked away in the corner of an older strip center on the east side of N 32rd just north of E Thunderbird.  It looks like it's been here for years, and I mean a lot of years...  But don't let deter you from trying the Dragon Palace!  Restaurant~ the decor is old.  It's is a thrown back into the late seventies and early eighties with huge red vinyl booths with the high backs.  The walls are solid blue (I guess as a contrast maybe?) with some Asian inspired borders and prints.  They have those old Asian lamps hanging for the ceiling.  Although this place is a through back into time of another era, the place is very clean and comfy.    Service~ excellent from when you enter their restaurant until you leave.  5 star service.  Food~ all of their lunch meals come with water and hot tea, complimentary.  They also offer the usual beverage choices if you so desire something else.  The hot tea was very good!    Their menu is also a through back to old Asian restaurants I used to go to when I was a kid.  I remember when mom would say "we are going to go and eat Chinese" and I would say "mom, we're not cannibals do you mean Asian or Chinese food?"    After a slap on the back of the head we were off ~ ready to get stuffed since they always brought you way too much food.  All of their lunch meals here at the Dragon Palace come with a very tasty bowl of egg drop soup (thick and tasty!), wontons, egg roles, rice is fried or steamed  and the main entree.  We had their Beef with Broccoli and their Mongolian Beef.  Both dishes were China-licious!!  Our entire meal was less than $20 with the tip!  I'm looking forward to going "Back in Time" at he Dragon Palace again real soon.  Hopefully I will see you there.

Phoenix Sky Harbor is one of the very best airports you could fly into or out of!  I travel a lot and I will admit that my rating of Sky Harbor was different a couple of years ago, but now they are one of the best!  Top reason's why Sky Harbor rocks! ~Location, location, location!! You don't have to drive way out to Timbuktu to catch a plane.  Super easy to get into the airport with east and west exits. ~Size does matter!!  It's smaller and easier to get around than some of the larger airports.  You don't have to ride a stupid train to get your baggage! ~It's very clean inside the terminals.  The decor is somewhat modern and it very interesting to look at.  They've done a very nice job with decorating the terminals in a desert theme but it doesn't feel like your in the desert...lol ~TSA stations are easy to get through especially if you use your iPhone for your boarding pass.  Not all airports are offering this yet. ~There are plenty of one stop flights available to most major cities!! YES! They offer free WIFI ~ I know, I know this should be the standard now in all airports but it NOT!  Several major airports don't offer free WIFI?!?! ~Plenty places to get a cup of coffee!  Sure I call this airport home ~ but I would be a challenge to find a much better airport in the US!

It's been a while since my last review of Sky Harbor, the International Airport in Phoenix so I thought I would give an update.  It's one of the best airports in the country whether your flying out or staying due to a lay-over.  Here are some of my Top Reasons why this is one of the best airports:  1 - it's clean especially comparing it to other major airports around the country.  Sky Harbor is the 10th busiest airport yet they manage to keep everything looking-smelling fresh 2 - easy to get around - the layout is super-duper easy to understand so there is less worry when trying to find your gate/luggage/car rental 3 - plenty of places to work on my laptop while waiting for a flight.  There are charging stations, plenty of restaurants-coffee places that offer places to charge your mobile devices 4 - some of the best coffee and places to eat in Phoenix are also located at Sky Harbor - LGO, Matt's Big Breakfast, Cowboy Ciao, Humble Pie, Delux, Press Coffee, Chelsea's Kitchen - all are terrific! 5 - the people that work in this airport are UBER friendly!    I hope to see you sometime during your travels at Sky Harbor!    Here are some fun factoids: Did you know... Sky Harbor is one of the ten busiest in the nation for passenger traffic with a $79 million daily economic impact.  On a typical day: More than 1,200 aircraft arrive and depart More than 111,000 passengers arrive and depart More than 800 tons of air cargo is handled The Phoenix Airport System (PHX Sky Harbor, PHX Goodyear and PHX Deer Valley airports), now including Sky Harbor Center, has a total econonmic impact of $28.7 billion. The direct impact of Sky Harbor International Airport, including Sky Harbor Center, is $9.5 billion.  Nonstop international flights from Sky Harbor create a $3.0 billion total economic impact within the Greater Phoenix metropolitan area.  Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is self-sufficient.

You gotta try Mim's Burger & Mexican Food for lunch if you haven't tried them already!  This is a little "hole in the wall" place located very close to the airport.  Catching an afternoon flight out to "BFE" from Sky Harbor the other day I decided to give Mim's Burger & Mexican Food a try.   I was greeted by this very friendly man, the owner I believe, who was doing everything from taking orders to cooking and cleaning.  This place is bigger on the inside than what it looks like from the outside.  It's "dive-ee" inside too, but its clean and he has some really cool retro video games and a couple of pinball machines :^)  I ordered a double cheese burger with a side of fries.  He fried the fries fresh and I watched him cook the burger.  Everything he makes is homemade and taste very good.    This is another one of those places "you can't judge a book by it's cover", so stop in see what's available inside.  Mim's is a great place for lunch if your on your way to/from the airport.  I'm looking forward to trying his fried fish or maybe even his BBQ brisket on my next visit!

We like the Harkins theaters over the other around the Phoenix area.  All of them seem to be very well run. They are clean, and for the most part have good service and this one fits this bill.  The Harkins theaters offer some specials for reduced drinks and popcorn refills, just ask someone for the details.   We came here to watch some local short films and we had an excellent time.  The movie theater was very accommodating and the short films were awesome to watch!    The seats are huge and comfy and you can raise up the arm rest to get closer to the one beside you if you plan to watch something scary! All of the Harkins theaters are kid friendly and most if not all offer baby sitting while you watch a movie. It's great!   Enjoy!

Yay, we found a cleaners that knows how to properly clean and press cloths and has great customer service! Cameo cleaners in Anthem offers several services on all types of clothing and linens including alterations.      They are conveniently located in the Safeway shopping center so it's an easy in and easy out. They have a convenient drive through for easy drop off and they offer free pick up and delivery to their regular customers.    Their prices are in line with the other cleaners in the area but what sets them a part from the others?  They offer next day pick up every day and same day service on items dropped off by 9am!  This is a HUGE + for us for last minute business trips.

The Liberty Market is a 4.45 star rated place for me.  Some days its 4 stars and on some days it's a 5 star, but most of the time is a solid 4 stars for me.  It's a great place to bring the family for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  We pick the Liberty Market over the other places in the area more often than not when we go to see a play at the theater.   The food ~ most everything is very fresh and taste very good.  I had most of their sandwiches, burgers and a few pizza's.  Everything is usually prepared very well.  On a few occasions we've been disappointed with their consistency of how some things are prepared but again overall a very good experience!  You should always try to save room for desert!  Their deserts are super delish especially their oatmeal and ice cream cookie and their carrot cake.    The dinning experience ~ I'm not a fan of waiting in line to order then setting and waiting.  It's a self serve place, which is okay especially considering their prices are very reasonable.  The folks that work here are always very friendly.  The restaurant is very comfortable and clean.    The Liberty Market is a place I recommend to my friends and to you.  If you haven't been to the Liberty Market yet, why not?  Everyone else in the Gilbert and East valley have :-)

We love surf & turf!  I mean who doesn't enjoy an extremely well prepared Filet Mignon accompanied with a succulent lobster tail? Oh Yeah!  So of course we had to go pay Fleming's a visit with some good friends.  We go to Fleming's for their steak because they know how to prepare it better than most!    For starters we were treated to a warm, rosemary loaf of bread.  The bread was already very good by itself, but the butters were even better.  I don't remember what each butter flavor was but I liked them both.  I preferred the orange (sun dried tomato maybe?) looking one.  The white one had a bit of a feta cheese taste to it.  We quickly polished off our whole loaf of bread.  Shortly after that, our soups and salads arrived, nothing special to write about here.  Next came our steak and lobster.  The server waited while we cut into our steaks to make sure that it was cooked to the precise way we had requested.  My lovely bride's steak was so small it looked as though it was meant to be on a tasting spoon and not part of a surf & turf. The server apologized and was embarrassed he had not noticed it prior to bringing it to our table and quickly sent for another one.  My steak was perfectly cooked, mid-rare but I could have used a bit more seasoning.  The lobster tail was the highlight for my meal. The lobster came out served on top of its tail shell, but then it was removed by the waiter, (as if I could not handle it on my own :-) The lobster was not at all dry, which I worried about.  It was moist, tender, and was pure lobster deliciousness!  As we dug into our steaks, we were given sides of asparagus and Fleming's potatoes.  I found the asparagus to be seasoned and cooked very well but a bit overly oily.  The Fleming's potatoes were like layers of lasagna, covered in a creamy sauce.  I've never been a big fan of any creamy potato dish, but this was exceptionally good.    For the finale we had Chocolate Lava Cake ~ a rich chocolate cake with a hot molten chocolate center, served with vanilla ice cream and sweet crisp wafers. The warm hot molten center with a scoop of the cool vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end this wonderful meal.  Fleming's is a fantastic place to dine for a couple, family or with good friends.  They are a chain, but they know how to cook steak very well and they are consistent. They have an exceptional wine list, which is what I recommend. Their well drinks are a too pricey (vodka & water X 2 = $24) so stick with wine.

I'm a fan of Chompies!  I usually eat at the one in the Mall but when I'm on his side of town I always seem to find a reason to stop by B^)  I've never had a bad experience at Chompies!  They are very consistent with how they serve their food and their service!  Food~ It's a strong 3 stars for me!  I prefer their sliders ~ pastrami is good and their matzah ball soup, potato latkes are also good as well.   Service~ It's always exceptional!  Everyone's very attentive and eager to help you find whatever deli item, your craving!  5 stars Pastries~ Total 4-5 stars!! They have some amazing pastries, cookies, cakes you name it ~ they make it!!  Whether you have time to eat or not, I will always find a reason to stop by to eat in or pick up something to go because they are very good and consistent at what they cook and serve!!   I hope to see you there!

Craving some sushi, I got a chance to go to Tokyo Lobby for the first time the other night.  After reading a few of my fellow Yelper's reviews on this place I was excited to find good sushi and sashimi on the West Side ~ in Glendale of all places!  To my amazement and bewilderment Tokyo Lobby serves some of the freshest and most delicious sushi I've had in the Phoenix metro including Scottsdale!  Wowsers! Why did it take me so long to find this place? Well it's a tiny place joined to a shoe store located in front of the "super-duper-take-your-money-and-run-Walmart-center" at 57th & Bell.  Since I hate shopping at "wally world" I have been driving past them for months not knowing about this little gem of a sushi restaurant.   I sat at the sushi bar where I could have a better view of the sushi maestro Kelvin Kim create the most wonderful sushi concoctions. The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated with Asian art and a few TV's to watch the games. The sushi bar is the main attraction with Chef Kim and another sushi master working their magic.  The service was top notch, very accommodating and eager to please their customers.  Food: Started with Hamachi Belly sashimi ~ very tasty, sweetest tasting tuna ever.  I ordered some fresh wasabi and ponzu sauce to go with my sushi rolls. I ordered the "what the heck" ~ nice punch of heat with great texture from the tuna and jalapeños and the Chicago roll ~ great blend of spicy crab/scallops with salmon.  Both were unique and outstanding!  Topped it all with a $5 sake bomb special ~ large Ichiban beer with hot sake.  "make it a double sake bomb pleeeeaaasseee!"   Huge THANKS to my fellow Yelper's for recommending this little sushi gem! I am looking forward to my next visit and trying another one of Chef Kim's sushi creations. I recommend you try Tokyo Lobby next time your craving for sushi and hope to see you there!

ROLF ~ I hate to give any business a 1 star rating especially when it's a locally owned but after two different visits to Hot Bagels & Deli in Surprise, I view them as a potential health hazard.    Our last visited started off on the wrong foot with the owners having a conversation between themselves and ignoring their customers.  We ordered two bagel sandwiches for lunch ~ asiago cheese bagel with ham & cheese and a side of chips and drink.  They only offered two choices of cheese, Swiss and American which I don't like either... My friend ordered a turkey & swiss (only choice) on a jalapeno bagel.    Half way through our bagel sandwiches I noticed little blue dots on bottom of his bagel and they were not jalapeno's, ROLF!  The bagels were old, chewy and came with a bit if penicillin apparently.  This was my second bad visit and don't plan to go back.  I tried to tell the owners about our experience and she turned away and walked off! wowsers!

This particular Starbucks has some very friendly barista's however you're positive experience at getting a tasty cup of you're favorite caffeinated beverage and doing some light reading or surfing Yelp stops there unfortunately.    They are very inconsistent at making their drinks.  They seem to have different people working each time I visit.  Their is nothing worse than spending TOO MUCH money for a cup of coffee already, let alone have it made wrong with either too much ice, not enough coffee or too much water...  Argue...  Another note, they need to focus more on cleaning their table/chair area for their customers. It was so dirty I could not stay and enjoy my watered down, over iced, not tasty beverage...

Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant is a great place to go for really good south of the border type of food that is really inexpensive.  This place is cheap!! and good :-)  Some really great friends of ours got us hooked on Mi Patio quite some time ago.  They are that kind of place that may not get your "frequent dinning" card but you'll remember them after a couple of months go by and go back.   Restaurant ~ it's kind of smallish and cozy looking on the outside but they  really have plenty of room on the inside.  The decor is a fun Spanish style with plenty of vibrant colors and textures.  It's not fancy by any means but very fun!  Service ~ is fantastic! We've been several times and have had different servers and they are all very friendly, helpful and eager to serve to you.  Food ~ chips and salsa are excellente!  We have not had a bad meal here, everything is good!  It probably won't be the best you've ever had but they are very good and extremely consistent.  I prefer their chili relleno or their baja chicken burro or their baja spinach and feta cheese chimi!  On my last visit they combined both baja's into one pollo-spinach-cheesy-delicioso-burro!  Tasty factor times 2!  You can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu.  We try something different on every visit ;-)  Beverages ~ Skip the $2.40 soda... and go for the $1.75 margarita's!!  Yeah!! They may not be the best margaritas but where else can you get a pitcher of this tasty beverage for $9?  This is a great place to go with friends, have a good time and go el-cheap-o and not feel bad about it.  We are grateful our friends introduced us to Mi Patio Mexican Restaurant!

Why write review on another Costco?  Well because this one trumps the rest of them in the Phoenix market when it comes to service.    This Costco has the best service.  Everyone is always friendly and accommodating, including the folks behind the returns desk.  No "roll of the eyes" here when you return something.    Another note on this Costco, is they seem to be more a weekend store, so do your shopping during the weekdays to beat the crowds.  Don't procrastinate when thinking about buying something here that is seasonal. They don't stay in stock very long especially after the weekends.

This Sportman's Warehouse is super confidently located just off the Hwy17 just south of the Hwy101 north.   It's a fantastic place to shop for all your camping and hunting needs.   They sell low to high end name brands in outdoor clothing, fishing/hunting equipment and camping gear.  It's much smaller than Cabelas but they pack a lot of variety and choices of items in their aisles and in some areas they offer as many choices to choose from.    They have a great staff that will help you find Anyang you need to make your camping and outdoor trips the very best possible.   They do sell items online that may not be available in their store, so if you can't find what you're looking for just ask someone to see if its available to order.  They are very competitive in their pricing and in most cases a better price than the larger competitors.    It's a fun shopping experience every time we go to this Sportman's Warehouse.  We always seem to find something new that we need to make our hunting/fishing trip more enjoyable.

I really want to like this place, I really... really do.  But after going here four times in the last year-ish and having the same experience every time, I am compelled to write:  The food is always pretty good, not great but it can be surprisingly very good at times.  I hope you're not hungry when you dine at this Romano's Macaroni Grill, because you'll get seated, and then you'll watch your server walk past your table 3 or 4 times without even looking at you. Then maybe they will stop by and take your drink order.  They will bring you their usual bread, in an effort to make nice and to think you will forget that they made you wait for your drink....   Then they will repeat the same routine, walking past your table, but this time, about 5 or 6 times, even though your drinks are empty and your menus closed on the end of the table.   Finally, they will take your order ~ spaghetti & meatballs and chicken parmigiana please...   They will stop by 2 to 3 times as you wait to let you know that your food will be out in just a minute or two.     45 minutes after you ordered, your food will arrive to your table with out an apology about the long wait, and they will try to tell you "the kitchen got soooo backed up."  Seriously???  We can see the kitchen from our table dude... Come on...  Not to mention it's a Tuesday night with the dining room is half empty?  But maybe it takes Romano's 45 minutes to boil noodles and fry a chicken cutlet?  Anyway, I really want to like this place, because the food can be really good, and the restaurant is in a nice location.  But I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon after having the exact same experience four times.    BTW ~ we don't care for the new way your serving water by using tap water to fill a pitcher, then to be carried over to fill a container located on the center tables only to fill yet another vessel, a bottle then bring it to us as if it's bottled H2O along with two small glasses.  Seriously?

I've been to this La Parrila Suiza a couple of times now. I keep getting invited by some friends to join them in this Mexico City food fest.  They love this place so I've hesitant in writing this review but after our last meal I feel I must "spill the beans"...  Service ~ They are really friendly and helpful when ordering but they are very slow. I mean, come on!  You can only play "eye spy" so many times before you loose interest in why your there to begin with.  The only... and I mean only reason we did not leave was due to their tri-salsa dippage action with crispy chips.  It is really one salsa a pico de gallo and a green creamy kinda of dip  Food ~ Chicken flautas were ok, three of them fried, topped with sour cream and Piquillo sauce served with rice, guacamole cole slaw and beans. The cole slaw and beans were not goo at all.    We also had the Chicken Melt which was very good but we were shorted one of the tortillas!  It was supposed to be two flour tortillas filled with melted cheese, chicken bacon, avocado and tomatoes, topped with cheese and a sauce. It also came with their beans rice and cole slaw.  It took so long to get our order we didn't bother saying anything...  Our last order was a chicken taco salad.  It was HUGE and served in a very crisp tortillas bowl.  The salad was tossed with all of the ingredients which was different.  I enjoy separating some of the chicken, cheese and other goodies in the salad bowl, but with this salad you could not do that ~ it was all tossed together.  The chicken was very cold and tasted blah. The bland dressing was also tossed into the salad which made this thing a big bowl of mushy lettuce, yuk-a-roo.  So if your meeting a friend and they are buying this might be a good place for you to go.

I think your either a fan of Lenny's or not a fan.  I can't seem to understand what the "fans" are tasting when they eat at this place.    I went to this Lenny's again last week for lunch and and had there single cheese burger with a side of fries and drink.  The burger was overcooked and tasted like something you would get a burger stand on a street corner. The toppings were ok but my bun was smooshed since it was on the bottom of the bag.  The fries were plain, possibly pre-frozen.  I tried their Mexican burger on my prior visit based on some Yelp reviews and it wasn't much better than last week's burger.    Bottom line, I'm not a fan yet but it's beats going to the chain fast food places since there is not many places to go in this area.  BTW ~ I find it very hard to believe the burger in the cover photo was taken at Lenny's... there's no way.

Lenny's Burger has its "BLING ON" now with it's new place right beside the old one!!  WOW, what an awesome looking 50's style dinner Lenny created in his new place with tons of chrome everywhere on the walls and ceiling, fancy lights above each booth and really very comfy booths!!  Had lunch with Rand H, Robyn N and Mike C today.  Take a look at the pics we took today!  Lenny's Burger offers several different burger and hot dogs options but they also have a few salad options as well.  All of the burgers and dogs can be ordered as a combo with fries and a drink.  To upgrade your fries to onion rings it's just an extra 30 cents.  They have shakes, malts and floats too.  I had their #5 ~ Cowboy burger with onion rings and a soda.  It was a burger with all the trimmings including bacon and onion rings on the burger.  The beef on this burger got a little lost with all the extras but it was still very good.  I spotted their #6 the Mexican Burger with grilled onions and green chilies for my next visit!!   The service at this Lenny's Burger is top notch!  They are very accommodating and eager to please their customers.  Their new place is really nice inside and out, so the next time your in that area and thinking about lunch, give Lenny's Burger a try.  I hope to see you there!

This is 60 minutes of my life that regretfully I will never get back and would like to!!  If there was the ability to rate this "no or negative stars" I would.  We went to Fry's Electronics based on a friend's recommendation to purchase a laptop. Our friend had the very best intentions in helping us find the best laptop for the very best price possible.  He recommended a particular sales person, however they were not there when we arrived. Now I know my friend had a a good experience with this particular person so I thought seeking help from someone else would be OK...  So my story begins:  We have never been to Fry's so when we pulled up to this huge retailer looking like a Mian Temple my son got real excited thinking this would be like a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" adventure, but we are looking for a laptop and not an Ark.   As we entered the store we were appalled at the grotesque Halloween display they had set up in the entry way.  It was this life sized zombie looking thing that was cut in half and crawling around on the floor.  It was so NOT APPROPRIATE and scared every little child that walked in.   We quickly walked past it to the computer area.  We enter the laptop area and walked past five employees.  No one said a word to us even though they made eye contact.  We stood in front of the laptops waiting for someone to show an interest in us, but no one did. I finally interrupted a conversation three of them were having together to ask for help.  They told us they would call someone to help us??? They weren't helping anyone.   As we were looking at the very tacky signs they had posted on all their laptops informing their customers about their 10% restocking fee, finally one of them came over and asked us if we had any questions.  I was looking for a laptop they had in their ad and was wanting to compare it to another laptop they had in their ad a week ago.  When I asked about these laptops he actually stated "the one from last week's ad is not on display and the other laptop you are asking about is over there and pointed" then he walked off to help someone else!  So another person finally approached us and asked us the same thing.  He was more helpful but in the middle of his sales pitch we were interrupted by one of his colleagues and he left us and said he would be right back but never came back!  I asked a third person if they could help us only to be interrupted again by yet another sales person. He walked off with this person and started helping someone else on his way back to us....  We finally asked to speak to a manager and the person that called told us it would be just a minute.  After waiting 10 minutes to speak to someone that wanted to sell us a laptop, the manager never showed up.  The person that paged the manager just looked at us and never followed up nor apologized.   I was beginning to think we were on some type of reality TV show where they "pushed your buttons" just enough until you break and throw a "smack down" on someone.  So we literally looked around to see if we were being taped.  We completely wasted an hour of our time and left.  We walked past five more people on the way out and no one acknowledged us...  So we went to Best Buy, dreading the experience and delightfully surprised!  We were acknowledged throughout the store and the sales person was the BEST!  They were very helpful and offered to match any price from Fry's.  To top it off, Best Buy doesn't charge a restocking fee should we need to do a return.  I am just baffled as to why anyone would buy anything from Fry's Electronics... HUGE WASTE OF TIME!

If your blink twice while looking for Mi Comida Resaurante Latino on Bell and 43rd Ave you'll miss it!!  This place is small and not very appealing on the outside.  But it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  What an awesome little "Ecuadorian Gem" of a place this is!    Mi Comida reminds us of some of the best Peruvian, Argentina and Columbian restaurants we used to go to in Miami but without all of the flair and the high prices. This is truly a mom and pop, locally owned restaurant serving up delicious South American dishes.  This place is very small and quaint with some personality. They do fill up during lunch and dinner, so you may want to come early to get seated right away.    I was excited to see they serve several traditional South American dishes and delicacies which are somewhat similar to but also very different than traditional Mexican food.  I was excited to try their shrimp and fish ceviche served the same way we get it in our favorite Argentina/Columbian restaurant in Miami, which is in a large goblet, tons of flavor and spice, enough to serve two.  It was fantastic!    We had to try their tamales which are a little different than the traditional Mexican tamales.  I recommend getting their Tamales Sampler which consists of a red shredded beef tamale which was excellente' ~ wound up ordering a couple to go, a white green chili with queso tamale, also excellente' and their Ecuadorian tamale which had pork, tomato, carrots and cheesy goodness wrapped in a banana leaf.  This tamale is worth making a second trip back on the same day ~ lunch and dinner!     My friend had their Seco de Pollo ~ chicken stew which was a wonderful dish and a chicken empandas for an app.  She loved it.  Friend #2 had their shrimp stew for an app and their Bandela Paisa with chorizo, carne asada, plantains, rice and other goodies.  The carne asada was tender and delicious with just the right amount of heat and sauce.  It too was excellente'.    Their menu offers several options so don't be afraid to ask the server about the dish before ordering.  Try their empandas, tamales or ceviche as an app or pick several different ones as a meal.  You can't go wrong here!  You will leave satisfied, happy and already to planning what to eat on your next visit.  I'm always a little cautious when I read reviews from people I don't know that state things like "this is the most authentic food..." especially when it's ethnic food and the writer is whiter than me.  Who knows, these writers may be from Ecuador and somewhere in South America, but what I do know is the food at Mi Comida Resaurante Latino taste as good as or better than some of the best South American restaurants I've been to.    They keep it simple with tons of flavor and lots of love! I hope to see you there.

The Touch of European Cafe is a quaint little place in one of those old homes that have been converted into a business just off the Historic Glendale square.  This place is locally owned by a couple of immigrants from Poland. They offer fantastic tasting Polish food and have exceptional customer service.     Now, I'm not a "beet" person so when I was asked to sample their red borscht-beet soup I was apprehensive to the point of making a grimmest face. But to my surprise it was delicious! We ordered some soup de jour, pierogi's both cheese and smoke sausage with onions for apps.  These pierogi's were amazing!  The best I've had in quite some time.    Since it was lunch we opted away from the delicious looking Polish Plate Specials and went for their gourmet sandwiches.  We had their Fresh Mozzarella, basil and tomato on cibatta bread toasted with their vinaigrette dressing.  It was very fresh and tasty. We also had a smoked polish sausage on a cibatta bun with their sauerkraut-slaw and mustard.  It too was very good and huge! We had to take half of it to-go. They have a lot of homemade deserts to choose from including Cheese Blintzes and Kolaczki Cookies, which we had both the apricot and raspberry ~ delish!!  The Touch of European Cafe is very small and popular so you may need to call ahead of time when dinning indoors for dinner.  They have outdoor seating which is perfect for dinning for lunch of dinner when the weather is nice. They are BYOW so you can bring your own favorite bottle of wine!    We are looking forward to our next visit, this time it will be dinner.  Planning to bring a nice bottle of Pinot Noir to go with either some Hunter Stew or some Stuffed Cabbage Rolls along with a side of pierogi's of course!  I might even have their soup de jour again!

We were hoping to find a good spot for breakfast on the far north side of town.  All of the good ones, aka Over Easy, Matt's Big Breakfast, etc are all south bound for us to drive.  Oak's Diner & Flapjacks was recommended to us by a local in Cave Creek.  It seemed busy enough, so our new breakfast adventure was a foot!  This place has a an older dinner vibe to it with loads of locals, you can tell by the hugs at the door when peeps walked in.  We were directed to a booth and told, "I'll be right with you".  At times these are the words I fear the most especially when places are busy.  Well, 15 minutes later I had to ask for service.  (I wasn't giving up on this place)  Someone showed up and took our order.   I ordered an all American-guy kind of breakfast - heavy/greasy and full of carbs!  I had eggs, hash browns and corn beef hash and a side of (according to their menu) award winning flapjacks.  My wife went healthy and order egg white omelet with spinach and a side of fruit.  My son had a stack of flapjacks.  We got our meal fast however we were grossed out by our server when we got our food.  She had the dirtiest hands I've ever seen on a woman, eeyuu gross!!  Food: ~ Eggs were fine, hard to mess up eggs ~ corn beef hash was like saw dust with no potatoes... Very dry and dust-like  ~ Hash browns were very basic and plain.  ~ Their flapjacks tasted, meh - Pillsbury or Betty Crocker taste as good or better.    End result of our breakfast adventure in Cave Creek is meh, still looking for a good breakfast place on the north end.

What a great "Americana" restaurant! This place brings back so many memories of what used to be very popular restaurant's back in the day ~  the buffet/cafeteria's.  This Furr's is conveniently located just west of the 101 Hwy on Grand and Sun City.  You can tell this Furr's has been around since the fifties based on their sign and building but they have done a very nice job maintaining everything inside and out.    I had a very enjoyable lunch last with some fellow Yelper's; Rand H., Mike C. and Scott W..  This Furr's is a cafeteria however once you go through the line once, you can go back as many times as you like to, all for the same price of $7.39.  I really liked this concept because your not picking through what other the prior people have handled ~ you know what I mean!  You choose what you want and they serve it to you.    They have most of the traditional "Americana" food options to choose from.  I recommend when you first go through the line asking for smaller portions and trying more varieties of things.  This way you can refill on what you really like without over stuffing yourself.  Everything was very tasty and fresh.  I'm looking forward to going back to this Furr's so hopefully I will see you there.

We've been to Pizzeria Bianco a couple of times but it's been a while.  I was glad to see they have not changed their menu and tthe quality of food hasn't changed, which is a good thing because they keep everything fresh and delish.    If your going just for the pizza pies, this might not be the place for you due to the wait time. My advise for the people that complain about the wait time ~ make friends!  Take someone more interesting with you next time you go to Pizzeria Bianco and your wait time will fly by!!   If your planning to enjoy an evening hanging with some friends, this is a wonderful place to go and enjoy some pizza, wine and conversation. Our wait was just over an hour, which is very good considering most wait times are 2 hours + but that didn't matter since we were at the bar enjoying some good wine and catching up on life's frills and thrills.  Time flew by during our wait and we were eating in no time.    We had their tomato, basil and homemade mozzarella salad for starters.  It was very good, fresh and the perfect balance of dressing. For dinner we had the Wise Guy and Sonny Boy pizza pies which were good but not the best I've tasted.  Their pizza crust is exceptional and the best feature of their pies in my opinion.  This is a must try if you haven't been and remember to take some good friends and enjoy the wine before you dine!!  We like Patsy Girmaldi's pizza pies as good or better but we enjoy the experience we have with our friends when we go to Pizzeria Bianco.

Barrio Cafe = Meh, I've had better!   We were looking forward to trying this place an now that we have, I at least can say I've them a try...  This place falls way short on the flavor-roma scale when it comes to tasty Mexican food.   We have a group of five, so we tried several things on their menu.  The first thing we noticed were the portions.  Muy pequena!  Ok, so this is different than what many of the pics on Yelp look like but maybe it's not the size that matters in this place but rather the quality of food.  Pues no, la calidad es el mejor promedio (nope the quality is average at best).  Many of the pollo and rice items were very dry.  We also had an issue with our server.  He was no where to be seen for several minutes so we had to sick the hound dogs after him to get some refills.   Anyways, this place seems to fill up with plenty of locals.  So good luck!

There are so many reviews on Lux and I could just reiterate what's been said already ~ but they really do have incredible coffee and pastries!!   Whether your a protagonist, fan or even if your dislike Lux, they have some of the best coffee is Phoenix and they have quite the following! This place is extremely busy ~ go figure!    The aroma when you walk in is a savory fragrance of roasted coffee and is truly delightful.  Their coffee is full flavored with palatible goodness from start to finish.  Their homemade pastries are scumptious and compliment your cup of joe or hot tea very well.  The barista's are cool, friendly and very accomodating.  Lux is very small so most of the time I will get my cup of joe to go.  Their decor has a very "coffee house" feel and they have some seating outside which is user friendly below 100 degrees outside, lol!   There are a lot of look-e-loos ~ people that like to stare at others.  Not sure why?  Maybe they think they know you or maybe they are looking for someone more interresting than the person they are with...

It's one of the best cup of coffee in Phoenix, if not the best.   Their coffee is always fresh and DELISH.  They have some very tasty baked goods as well.  Their lemon bars are fantastic, sweetness with a lot of tartness = yumfest!    Sure, they seem to be busy all of the time but there is always room for a few more people.  The layout at Lux is surprisingly more spacious than what most people think.    This is a great place to meet up with some friends over some fantastic coffee and some goo eats!  Looking forward to seeing you there!

Who would have thought Tommy Bahamas was anything but a clothing store?? I've eaten here at least three of four times and despite some of the mixed Yelp reviews, I really like this place.    I recommend going early for drinks at the bar. Ok... I recommend going to the bar almost always regardless of where you go out to eat.  It makes it for a "good time" with your friends, especially at Tommy Bahamas due to their topical-tropicana-beach-esk theme they have going on.  They will make you almost any kind of "fruity ~ tropical" kind of drink known to mankind.   We sat outside in their patio area under an umbrella. Very enjoyable and a high recommend when you go.   The tropical music they pipe through the air and the Magnum-esque clothing worn by the staff all make for a relaxing atmosphere. We were there on a weekday, and it was pretty empty until the conference crowd showed up just after noon. The food was surprisingly good.  I had the Lemongrass encrusted Ahi, seared rare, sweet chili sauce, cilantro oil, island almond rice, shiitake mushrooms, minus the toasted sesame seeds with baby bok choy.  It was a little pricing at $30 - but very good! The crab bisque was also good. They also offer some Gluten Free dinner and lunch selections as well.  The real surprise here was the service. Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was amazing. Very friendly and attentive. for example, I asked for more chili sauce and he brought out both the chili sauce and their spicier chili sauce which he thought I might like better. AWESOME!  Yes this is a "Touristy" kind of place and it's over priced, but it is also a good dinning experience to have with your friends and a cool place to shop for that special Magnum-esque attire you've always wanted : -)

Ok, it's been way too long since I've update my last review... But I've been back a couple of times now over the past couple of months and here is my take;  Food~  yes it's still a "gut bomb" but not a "total gut bomb" if you order the right things and besides everything here is very tasty and addictive!!  I suggest getting the veggie quesadilla, Polo Diablo or Jade Chicken with the Jerk Fried Rice and skip the beans.  This is a very tasty dish and you'll take me later for ordering without the beans :-)  If you have been to Chino Bandido, you're in for a wild ride with some tasty Mexican-Asian Fusion dishes!!  Save room for their snickerdoodle cookie or if you wait and go on the weekend you might get lucky and get a Lava Cookie!! NOM, NOM, NOM!!  I'm looking forward to seeing you there!!

One of the best places in Phoenix for lunch, dinner or brunch!! I've eaten here a couple of times and forgot to write a review = bad Yelper..  But after hearing back from a friend that I suggested this place to, they loved it and have since been back here 3 times within the past couple of weeks!!   Food~ yes their pizza is DELISH however they offer many other dishes that I think you will find just as delightful or maybe even better!  For lunch, please consider ordering the PLT - toasted prosciutto, mixed greens, tomato and spicy roasted bell pepper aioli.  Ask them to add some cheesy mozzarella goodness if your a fan like me : -)  It is one of the best sammiches you'll find around the Metro.  For a lighter lunch but just as filling go for one of the awesome salads;  The Capri, or the Couscous salad or my fave the Mele ~ organic mixed greens topped with chopped chicken, walnuts, apples, blue cheese and an apple vinaigrette dressing = yum-fest!!   For dinner, start with a either their grilled veggies or the antipasto special; meat and cheeses!  Both are wonderful!  Have fun choosing a pizza!! They are all too good for me to mention one over the others.  Seriously!! Just save some room for one of the Nutella crepes!!  They a couple of different ones to choose from ~ they are a super way to wrap up a wonderful meal!!  Restaurant~  This place is loads of fun yet it is somewhat romantic too! Sit outside and enjoy their terace - patio when the weather permits. It's a wonderful setting and a great place to have fun convo with a date or with friends.  Their indoor seating is also wonderful.  There's not a bad seat in this place.  The service is excellent!! They are very attentive, they know their menu items and help even the pickiest eater find something they would like!!   I'm looking forward to going back to Cibo very soon!  I hope to see you there!

I think I've become a FEZ fan...  This place is Fantastic, Extraordinary and a bit Zealous when it comes to delivering a unique dinning experience.    Their unique menu options for salads, flat bread pizza's, burgers and signature dishes are extraordinary and delicious. It can be over whelming trying to order everything on their menu, so don't.  Pick what you are craving for and chose something you'll want to try on your next visit.  There portions are a bit large, so take a friend or two and share something different.    Go for the burger ~ their burgers are burgerlicious!  Try their FEZ burger ~ with their BBQ sauce,  a pear slice (yes a pear), feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro on a toasted ciabatta bun.  It is a mouthwatering flavor-fest combination that your taste buds will thank you for! Their Tangier burger ~ with a hummus spread, herb pesto and  manchego cheese is also very appetizing and delectable.  Their fries are fresh cut and fried.  Their spicy harissa fries are scrumptious especially with their aioli! The sweet potato fries with their sweet dipping sauce is also a good choice.      Salads, pizza's and other options ~ so far everything I've tried has been delish.  Their FEZ salad and Balsamic Apple salad are both very good.   The Crisp Pomegranate Chicken is also an excellent choice.  It has a very nice balance between the herb crusted chicken with a tangy pomegranate dressed organic spinach, roasted peppers, artichokes, chickpeas and dried apricots.  HH ~ this is a great place to go for Happy Hour!! From 4-6:30 pm and late night 10pm-12am they offer 2 for 1 well, beer, margaritas and a $3 house wine! They also have different daily drink specials, like margarita Mondays and Martini Tuesday etc...   It can get a bit loud at times, especially when the place is packed (which is most of the time). If your wanting a quieter experience go for a later lunch or an earlier dinner and take advantage of their HH!

Patsy Grimaldi's is one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale!  It has truly original taste and really can't be compared to any other pizza in town.  Their pizza reminds us of good pizza from back east.  I like them better than Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix.  Grimaldi's pizza is just as good if not better, you get more for your money, your wait time to be served and 2 hours less and it's more kid friendly.     Their North Scottsdale location is tucked away in DC Ranch which creates a great ambiance for dinner with friends for a romantic night with a loved one. You can create just about any type of pizza or calzone you want. They use very fresh products and their service is outstanding.   The only thing that I found a bit annoying has nothing to do with the food, just that DC Ranch does not offer the best parking.  It can get very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights in this area of DC ranch, so go early.  You can't fault Grimaldis for the poor parking, they are just in a great location.  When the weather cools down, sometimes there is entertainment in the local park area next to Grimaldi's.  You can walk over and enjoy the tunes!    Overall I highly recommend this place, great food, great service and good fun.  When your older Italian friends from back east enjoys it, it is worth it!

Ok, I have to admit I'm a secret admirer of Matt's delicious ever so crunchy, thick and well seasoned bacon!! Bacon, Bacon, Bacon is what keeps me coming back to Matt's Big Breakfast and of course their pancakes, pork chops, omelets, hash browns, home fries...  This place is small as many Yelpers have stated already and no thanks to Guy and his "Triple D" it's hard to find the right time to come to Matt's with out having to wait due to all the foodie followers of Food Network.    The service at Matt's is what you make of it. If your in a rush, let your server know and she will accommodate you, but if you don't say anything you'll wait for refills.   As many Yelpers have already stated their food is amazing!  Matt uses the freshest ingredients, most of which are organic and locally grown.  I had something not on their normal menu: scrambled eggs with sliced chorizo, jalapeños and cheesy goodness with a side of their hash browns, toast and of course bacon!  It was FANTASTIC! Great combination and it wasn't spicy at all!  Ask for it when you go, you must try it!! They bacon and chorizo are made special for Matt at a market.  He uses Wildflower's bread and the egg and veggies are all from local farmers.  Recommendation:  Stacy C is right, the best time to come is during the week and in the early or late morning.  Plan a business breakfast in lieu of a luncheon.  We went last week and the three of us had problem finding a table, be it a small table : -)

Al Hana, their restaurant inside of the grocery store is a total 5 stars!  This review is for the Baiz Market, the grocery store.  For us, this is a great "go to" place for some key items we need from time to time that our local grocer doesn't carry and/or they offer a better quality.    Some of the items we shop for while at the Baiz Market;  ~the BEST place in town to get your pita bread!  Both white and wheat and in different sizes.   ~they have a fantastic selection of middle eastern spices especially curries.   ~they have some great butchers that will chop, slice and dice every part of a lamb, cow or goat.   ~they butcher fresh ground to 30/70, 20/80 and 10/90  ~a great selection of nuts, sesame seed and olive oils, curries ~some great pastries   Sometimes they have seasonal produce you may not find at your local grocer but you have to search for it.  Their produce is not one of their qualities.    It's a great place to pick up some groceries and have a bite to eat!  Maybe I'll see you there.

This is a great place to go for lunch or dinner if your in the area.  It is also becoming one of our regular "stay vacation" destinations for dinning when we stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort.    Restaurant ~ decorated with plenty of "cow poke" decor everywhere with a rustic saloon kind of feel to it.  It's very clean and they have a huge patio that over looks part of the swimming area. They have a nice but somewhat small bar area with a TV if your not into the western thing.  Service ~ everyone is very friendly and attentive to their customers.  Not sure why some Yelpers have been treated differently but we've been to Hole-in-the-Wall several times without any issues and find their service to be very good!   Food ~ They have changed their menu over the past couple of years and we miss a few of the exotic things they used to offer.  Their current menu has a very good variety choices to choose from.  If you like ribs, they have some very good tasting ribs with a good smoke ring.  If you and your guest are hungry I would suggest getting their Backyard Feast for two.  It is a bottomless plate of BBQ goodness starting with salads, ribs, smoked brisket, smoked chicken and some side dishes.  This is one of those dinners to where you skipped lunch earlier and your ready to belly up to some good eats!  We like their smoked and gilled salmon with a three chili peach chutney and fried green tomatoes.  Yum!     Don not forget desert here!!  They may talk you into their creme brulee, which is delish or their house made warm donuts served with a chocolate creme sauce which is also very tasty, but just say no and go for the make your own s~mores!  We have a blast cooking (charing) our marsh mellows over the little open fire they bring to your table and then smashing the melty-marsh-mellowy goodness between two gram crackers and a piece to chocolate bar!  It's loads of fun!    Pointers ~ Ask them about their dinning package.  When you stay at the Pointe Hilton Resort you receive two $25 vouchers upon check in to be used towards your dining experiences.    They have a really fun swimming pool, great resort and a really neat restaurant ~ Hole-in-the-Wall!  Plan a "stay vacation" and enjoy one of the fun "gems" Phoenix has to offer.  May be we will see you there.

This Hash House A Go Go has become a must stop by, place to eat when in Vegas!  There are so many great places to dine when in Vegas.  This place is not close to the strip, so it doesn't hit a lot of people radars when they search Yelp for a great place to eat.  But if you're willing to take a little drive or cab ride off the strip and want a super meal, breakfast-lunch or dinner, this Hash House A Go Go is a fantastic place to go!!  Location~ just a couple of miles off the strip in the Asian Market area.  The restaurant is very clean and inviting and easy to find.  It has a great ambiance that is family friendly.   Food~ it's hard to choose from one of their many hash skillets if you're dining for breakfast or just feel like eating breakfast for dinner.  Their veggie and corn beef hash skillets are two of my faves.  Both are DELISH, served with eggs of your choice, on top of potatoes and with a biscuit (or what ever you would like to eat)!  They also have super burgers and pretty extensive menu with loads of things to choose from.  Yes, their portions are huge, so you may want to share with a friend if you're not hungry :-)  Service~ it's always top notch.  They are very accommodating even for the pickiest of eaters.   They are very friendly and eager to help you.    This is one of the best places to dine in Vegas off the strip.  They offer flavorful food and super service.  I hope to see you there some day soon.

Eek!  This was a second time in just a few weeks I've had a "Meh, I've had much better experience!"  What has happened to Cornish Pasty???  So I felt compelled to write a review about my experiences so that others would know this Cornish Pasty is in need of some management/owner love/help or something....   Service~ yikes! It was turrible, to quote Charles Barkley.  Both visits were the same experience but with different servers.  The servers here seem more interested in talking with each other rather than serving their customers.  On both visits we had to remind our server multiple times to refill our drinks and bring us condiments.  Probably the biggest disappointment is when we complained about our food.  They both were very disinterested in turning our poor dining experience into a positive one.  When we asked to speak to someone in charge in our 2nd turrible visit the waitress disappeared!  I kid you not!  She never came back and when we asked the bartender about her she stated that she went on a break....  Food~ prior visits we've had a pretty good experience trying the different pasty's however lately their food has not been up to par!  The pasty's are very dry lately for some reason and they lack flavor.  This last visit we had the bangers and mash, chicken and the traditional beef and potatoes.  We also had a couple of side of fries and some salads.  The salads and fries were the best parts of our dining experience again unfortunately.  The banger and mash was ok.  It had a good balance of bangers to mash but had too much onions.  Since when did onions become a major star in this pasty?  The chicken pasty was not filled completely and was very dry.  The waitress suggested the red wine sauce to help?? WTH?  NO THE RED WINE SAUCE DOES NOT GO WELL WITH ALL PASTY'S, ESPECIALLY THEIR CHICKEN PASTY! It was gross!  We asked for a different sauce.   The waitress stated that was their only sauce but she could bring us ketchup and that's what a lot of people use.  Yes she did say that! If a lot of people are requesting ketchup, the cook, heck the owner needs to know their customers are having to douse their pasty's in ketchup because they are too dry.  The beef and potato pasty was more potato than beef and yes it was arid dry as the desert....  So for both visits I give this Cornish Pasty 2 stars because of their salad and fries.  For had we not order those this would easily be a 1 star review. I hope they can turn this place around soon!

What a nice little "gem" ~ Fuego Bistro, to find that serves great food, has a nice ambiance and is conveniently located from just about anywhere (that is if you can find it : ^)   Our journey to Fuego's started by making a U turn in the middle of 7th because we missed Palo Verde Drive.  Some advise here ~ if you're not familiar with this area, using your iPhone or android map is a must! Although I must say, my co-pilot was using their android phone, that's why I had to make the U turn....  My iPhone would have done a better job in getting us there.    Back to our journey ~ we finally found Fuego Bistro, ugh...  or at least a sign that stated Fuego Bistro...  but the sign was in front of of hair salon and a dance studio.  Thankfully I read the Yelp reviews before going and knew this place was located somewhere behind these places.  Park the car, this is it!  After walking past stated businesses we found Fuego's Bistro! Tadda!  This is somewhat of an unpretentious restaurant with dinning both inside and on a patio.  We chose inside due to the weather.  It was not crowded so we were seated right away.  The service was very accommodating and pleasant.  We got our drinks right away and our apps were not far behind.  Drinks were very good and our empanada's as our apps were OK.  I would have preferred the salsa on the side so I could control how much to use.    We ordered the Fuego Enchiladas ~  chicken breast stuffed in flour tortillas, black beans, jack cheese, in there homemade red chili dijon cream sauce with a side of their black beans and rice.  It was very good, great temp with a nice balance of spice and seasonings.  The rice was the side "super star"!  I chose their House Speciality ~ Chili Relleno which was stuffed with chicken breast, black beans, jack cheese, cilantro, panko bread crumbs, covered with guajillo chile sauce and it was also served with black beans and rice.  The stuffing in my chili relleno was delish!  The breading on the out side was a bit too thick for me and tasted a little stale.  But the stuffing and rice were fantastic!    This is a great little "gem" of a restaurant and I am looking forward to going back to Fuego Bistro again very soon.   Next time I will most definitely use my iPhone map, I might make a hair appointment first, then eat at Fuego's and then book a dance class afterwards to burn off what I just ate : ^)

I have been to Binkley's a couple of times now to experience their multi-time, James Beard Award winning dinning experience and walked away thinking; either my pallet is completely unrefined and I need new glasses or the peeps that awarded Kevin Binkley his award must have had a few to many cocktails prior to their dinning experience.    The food was very good but really... two bites?  Come on!  I can go just about anywhere and eat just two bites and think their food tasted good.  It's the whole meal people are wanting to experience and not just the baby bites you are creating.  Please put some time and energy into cooking the rest of the dish and let's see if your molecular gastronomy - culinary offerings are James Beard worthy then.   The wine was exceptional.  I do appreciate the fresh ingredients your prepare and find your plating whimsical yet comical unfortunately at my expense...  After the multi course of spoon tastings and bite sized hors d'oeuvre's we left with a $250 bill for two.  No worries, I had a $200 gift certificate this time from a friend that wanted me to experience Binkley's one more time just to show me that I do in fact need new glasses and my pallet needs more refining.    They chose not to honor my $200 gift certificate due to my certificate was just over 12 months old...  Let's see, you cashed the money you were paid for a certificate to dine at your establishment but you won't honor it now and potentially win my business going forward?   If your looking for a place that has a fantastic wine list, obtusely unique, expensive and self indulging then this is the place for you.

I sooo wanted to like this place.  Especially based on other Yelper reviews however after dining here twice and having almost the exact same experience I have to rate them as a "meh, I've experienced better".    The parking is ridiculous but in no way plays a role in my rating of this Vermont Sandwich Company.  Their sandwiches are unique and they use exceptional bread which they may make themselves however everything else was just ok.  On this last visit I had their Vermonter which was very good however the side salad was very disappointing. On my first visit I had some potato salad with my turkey sandy, the Nectar i believe, and it needed some salt, seasoning.    On both visits I voiced my concerns about my disappointment and I was offered a very casual apology and a cookie.  A cookie?  Ok, so lets try their unique peanut butter with bacon cookie.  Yikes, it tasted like bacon grease...  The folks here seemed very disinterested in my comments and passed me off like I was just another number to them on both visits so this "number" will find somewhere else to eat!

This has to be one of the "better" Home Depot's to shop at in the Phoenix market.  This big orange home supply store has almost everything you need for those weekend "honey due" projects.   It's in a great location that's easy to find.  The inside is very clean and well organized as far as Home Depot's go.  This location is not as busy as the other Home Depot's due to it's location yet they offer all the same product selections and seem to be always be in stock with the things other Home Depot's may run out of.    Their paint, wood, plumbing, appliances and out door areas are top notch and staffed with knowledgeable experts.  Can't say the same about their lighting, electrical and power tools which is keeping them from getting 5 stars.  The next time you need supplies for your home repairs, this is the place to shop!

Barro's pizza looks like a chain, smells like a chain and may even feel like a chain (ahem - I didn't "feel up" anyone, I am talking about the ambiance) BUT THEY ARE NOT A CHAIN!!  Their pizza taste way better than any chain pizza joints!!  This particular Barro's is very good! Fantastic service ~ friendly, fast and eager to please.  They are also consistent from visit to visit.  They have a good selection of pizza's to choose from but don't let stop you from getting creative with your order.  They will accommodate even the most finicky pizza peeps and will make what ever type of pizza your craving.      Some of favorite pizza's that Barro's cooked very well: Cheese pizza ~ extra cheesy goodness, my son loves it!  Their meaty pizza is also a fav of ours.   If your wanting a pizza and your in Anthem, this is the place to go!!  You won't be disappointed.

Look out See's, Ethel's Chocolate Lounge has your number and have declared that they are the Chocolate champions!  Try some if their newest creations of chocolate.   I'm not a huge fan of sweets including chocolate, but this place is hard to pass up when your inside.  I challenge anyone to stop by a parooz this place without trying or buying something!  Oh my, this is chocolate at its best.    The service is unbeatable.  They very very friendly and eager to help you and your family choose a chocolate delight that will fill your craving. This place is very cozy and a nice break away from the gambling/shopping.

Is there anything better than eating outdoors on a nice sunny day with temps in the low 80's on green grass among plenty of citrus trees and evergreens  in Phoenix Arizona??  Well this is the setting everyday throughout the fall and spring at Joe's Farm Grill!!  I can't believe I haven't written a review on Joe's Farm Grill already.  It's an awesome place to take the family and friends for breakfast or lunch.  Their menu is built around things people love to eat now a days and it starts in their garden rather than in their restaurant.  They actually grow most of not all of the produce they use in their dishes on site. They will offer some seasonal sides, dishes and deserts based on the seasonality of their fruits and veggies.    There are loads of reviews already written about specific dishes that are favorites at Joe's Farm Grill, so I wont go into a lot of details concerning their menu.  Some of my favorites at Joe's Farm Grill ~ BBQ smoked chicken pizza which is grilled with some char, topped with plenty of blue cheese, some veggies and BBQ sauce.  It is DELISH and the perfect app to share with friends.   Some of my fav's:  ~Fontina Burger, Chicken Pesto sandwich, ~Sonoran Dogs ~ get the X2 for $9.99 with either their tasty onion rings or sweet potato fries with their Pineapple-serrano dipping sauce, ~Ahi Tuna and the grilled peanut butter and banana sandwiches ~Thai Ahi Salad and Chicken Caesar Salad   All of these are a flavor-fest your mouth and tummy will thank you for later :^)   Don't forget to leave room for desert at "The Coffee Shop" or a tasty shank/malt!  Everything at Joe's Farm Grill is is well prepared and they are consistent in delivering quality, fresh tasting food.    This place can get insanely busy on the weekends especially when the weather is nice.  You may want to plan your visit to Joe's either early lunch or late breakfast during the week.  Bring your dog and kiddos so they can play on the green grass and enjoy a meal outside.  I hope to see you at Joe's soon!

This place is becoming our favorite Italian restaurant in the area!  Times Square Pizzeria is a wonderful gem to find in a city that has so many places to choose from. They offer weekly and daily specials, so remember to ask about them before par oozing their menu.     Food~ everything we've tried has been DELISH!   Some of my faves to recommend to you;  apps fried calamari and their antipasto salad are excellent.  In addition to tasting excellent, their portions are HUGE, so plan to share!   pizza; go for the NY Combo with pepperoni, Italian sausage, olive, mushrooms, onion and peppers.  Their Genovese pizza with grilled chicken, ricotta, pesto and mozzarella is also very good!   Pasta; go for the tortellini D Angelo ~ oh my!   Cheese stuffed tortellini in a vodka sauce with Italian dried and domestic mushrooms and chicken.  The rigatoni alla Laura and the pasta Giovanni are also great dishes!  You wont be disappointed.   Seafood; we like the Cioppino and Pescatore!  Both are very good!    Restaurant~ this place is kind of small and in an area of north Phoenix you may not have been to before but they are worth the trip!  Their restaurant is very clean and lightly decorated.  They've made the most out of its size.    Service~ everyone's very friendly and eager to serve!  The kitchen doesn't seem to miss a beat and is very accommodating to even the most finicky eater.    The Times Square Pizzeria is a fantastic place for you to dine with family and friends.  They do get busy during the peak times for lunch and dinner so plan your time accordingly.  We hope to see you there soon!

Dara Thai is probably the best place to dine in Anthem in regards to quality of food. They have an extensive menu with most of the traditional Thai dishes along with   Here are some recommendations:  For apps, veggie rolls, crab wontons are ok, but go with the Satay ~ slices of chicken marinated in curry and grilled. It comes with peanut sauce and cucumber dip which is not actually dip, it's yummy pickled cucumber slices in this ridiculous somewhat sweet sauce that may entice you lick the bowl and ask for more...    Soups; their Koew Num (wonton) soup is good however I suggest going for the Tom Ka Gai which is a hot/sour soup with chicken, lemon grass, mushrooms, something else not sure what is but taste good in a coconut milk broth served in a "flaming soup tureen".    Dinner/Lunch; Pad Thai, Kao Pad Kari, Panang Curry are all good and you would not be disappointed but I recommend either Pad Gaeng Pa Curry or Goong Gartiem Prik Thai ~ shrimp dish with garlic, snow peas, onions and broccoli.  They also have a few nontraditional Thai dishes like Orange chicken and Beef with Broccoli in case your with someone that is not a fan of Thai cuisine.   Heat levels are somewhat conservative so you may need to order a little hotter than at other locations. Service is friendly and quick.  Their prices are very reasonable and their portions are on the larger size, so you can share with someone if you choose to.

Very good experience at Los Reyes de la Torta! Their service was exceptional and very friendly. They make you feel at home. I had the Torta Del Rey and shrimp ceviche. The portion size of my Torta was humongous!! It included: breaded beef, pork, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, almost everything but the kitchen sink! It was ok but my breaded beef and pork were over cooked, so it made my torta dry. They give you a red and green homemade salsa to put on it.   The shrimp ceviche was FANTASTIC! So good I had to get some to go! I look forward to coming back and trying a different torta of something else (and the 99 cent ceviche of course).   I recommend you try Los Reyes de la Torta, you wont be disappointed.

Yay!  I'm still a fan and I think this Torta is "As good as it Get's!! If your craving a really tasty torta, Mexican sammich, you can not beat Los Reyes De La Torta, aka the Mexican Sammich King!!   The shrimp ceviche is DELISH!!  They have a super duper salads also for a great app or as a meal.  But it's the torta's that I come here for!!  Yes they have loads of other things on their menu you can choose from if your not a torta kinda person, but then I would ask; "why are you here?  Seriously?"  :-)  The Torta Del Rey is crazy tasy but ginormous!!  You better have a HUGE appetite or plan to share this with a friend.  They still throw everything on this bad boy but the kitchen sink : -)  I would also suggest their Ranchera de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, guac, fresh cheese, chopped onion & cilantro & a chipotle dressing.  or their Nortena de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado.    It's all good at Los Reyes De La Torta!!  I hope you give them a try if you haven't already!!  I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try their new torta, King Carlos V.  It looks AWESOME!! I hope to see you there.

The Palazzo is almost like my second home.  No not really but if I were to have a place in the strip this would be the place!   The hotel is beautiful and their service is excellent, it's a palacial setup with extraordinary decor, it's very comfortable and inviting.  It's not an uber large hotel/casino with plenty of free space and less crowds.     The location makes this place a great destination for it's located near the casinos and shows we like to visit.    They have some excellent restaurants and shops between the Palazzo and the Venetian.   We like how the two are tied together.  We've stayed at the Venetian but prefer the rooms and service at the Palazzo.      The service is amazing.  They are very accommodating and they will find a way to make your trip even more enjoyable.     This is a fabulous hotel and casino.  They are well worth the money and if you gamble to May even get a night comped.   I'm looking forward to see you at the tables here in the Palazzo!

The reviews on this place concerning their popularity are correct especially for dinner at La Piazza al Forno so we opted for lunch and were seated immediately. This is a smaller restaurant with a very "homey feel".  No frills but a really cool Italian/"Mom's kinda place" atmosphere and they have great service.    There were so many things we wanted to try, one of which was pizza cooked in their wood-fueled-brick-oven.  We tried the La Pizza Bianco ~ it has a mildly chewy somewhat thin crust, blistered and charred in spots.  It was a bit chewier than what I expected so we had to eat it with a fork, but still very tasty.  It had fresh mozzarella, ricotta, lots of basil and garlic, and their garlic butter sauce. This pie was delicious and it could possibly be good at repelling vampires but not a good choice for a first date with someone you're going to kiss afterwards...   They have a wide variety of pastas and salads to choose from as well.  On our second visit we tried their linguine with red clam sauce which was also very good.  The clams were cooked well, tender not over done like at most places and their marinara sauce was on point! We also order just a slice of pizza and side salad.  This was somewhat disappointing because the slice of pizza tasted somewhat old and of course reheated.  It did not have the same "wow" tasting factor as did our pizza on our prior visit.  We shared this with our server and she stated it was how they serve their slices and did not offer a new slice...    We ordered some New York Cheese Cake for desert and it was delish as well! Another person had a slice of pizza   This is a great place to go if you're looking for good Italian food and fantastic pizza! Our only concern was ordering just a slice that was old and reheating it is usually fine but not in this case, this slice was too old.  Next visit ~ don't take a chance and just order just a slice, order a whole pizza instead!  It's well worth it.

Z's Greek is a solid 4 to 5 stars every time I visit this little place just around the corner of 40th and Indian School.    Don't let the exterior of this place deter you from stopping by.  Z's Greek looks sort of "a dive" from the curb and they desperately in need to repave their parking lot which is littered with pot holes. BUT, and I mean a big BUT, the inside is very clean and welcoming.    They have a fairly large menu of Greek selections to choose from.  I tend to order the same thing ~ Gyro with a side Greek salad in lieu of fries and drink for $7.95.  On this visit I added a side of hummus and pita chips.    This Gyro was packed full with meat, tomatoes, red onions and thee perfect amount of tzatziki sauce.  (see pic)  The pita was tender and warm which made this Gyro full of flavor.  The Greek salad comes with a mound of feta cheese on top of a great balance of lettuce, veggies and dressing.  I would highly recommend their salad over fries any day when ordering a combo.  The hummus was very tasty ~ smooth and fresh.  You can order anything to your liking if you don't see something on their menu you are familiar with.  The Z's Greek Crazy Fries and Souvlaki's are also very good.   Z's Greek is a great place for lunch or dinner when you're craving Grecian cuisine.  Just look out for the pot holes when you park : -)  You won't be disappointed and glad you tried Z's Greek!!

This Cracker Barrel is very clean, well ran, good food and some very good employees.  The breakfast here is better than "The Good Egg" and also better then "Denny's" in my humble opinion.    Some recommendations:  Moma's Pancake Breakfast ~ You get three buttermilk pancakes, two eggs cooked to order with your choice of any fruit topping or syrup. I usually go for the hot fried apples with an extra side of their maple syrup as a filler.  This is served with smoked sausage patties, turkey sausage patties or thick-sliced bacon.  This is a HUGE breakfast full of carb's so be prepared to walk it off afterwards!    Another recommendation is their Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ~ You get two Eggs cooked to order with grits, gravy and buttermilk biscuits, oh ya, and get their  Apple Butter to go with the biscuits. It also comes with your choice of fried Apples or hashbrown casserole, go for the hashbrown casserole and their country fried steak.  This is enough food for two people!!    Yes this is a chain, but this Crackle Barrel is worth it.  They are consistent  with their execution in preparing their breakfast dishes and their services is very good.  Maybe I will see you there!

I agree with Laura E, Over Easy is now just Meh!!! What's happened to Over Easy?  HELLO Mr Owners of OE, your service and food have changed since your move and it's not a good change...  We've watched the decline of this little "hole in da wall" breakfast joint that used to be one of the best places to go in the mornings ~ Pre Food Network and Triple D....  I can see where your trying to accommodate more people in your new place but COME ON, I was elbowed twice while eating next to strangers beside us!  This is not a comfortable environment for dinning unless you want to get cozy and share your food with strangers...  The service was very disappointing, blunderous, and left us wanting.  Our drinks were not maintained and when we had issue concerning our meal our server told us it would be a while before we could get another order of pancakes, without an apology.   We had the chicken and waffles, which were ok ~ the chicken was nice and crisp but was a little over done. The waffle was flat and plain. We also had pancakes with sides of bacon and sausage. The pancakes were cold for some reason so we wanted to order some fresh but our server was not helpful. The bacon was very good as was the sausage.  We also had the Wolfpack, which was very good with two eggs, bacon and cheese between layers of crisp buttery hashbrownie goodness. Very filling but not something to order if your watching your carb in take.   I hope you listen to the Yelpers and make some changes soon.  There are too many other places to dine for breakfast and lunch that are as good if not better than you now.  After all the Food Network foodies have tried your place for the first and last time ~ The Yelpers (regulars) want the old Over Easy service and quality of food back please.

Hey this is a great place for a sandi if you planning to see an event an event at Westgate!   It's a creative way to create "which wich" or what we call a sandi, you are craving for.   They offer a variety of proteins to choose from and/or you create a veggie sandwich!  The kiddos and adult enjoy their process of selecting what they want on a paper bag using a sharpie.  They offer homemade chips or sun chips ~ both are great options to choose with your sandwich.    Some tips; check to see if they are offering a Yelp check in!  When we were there last, we received a free homemade cookie that was delish!  If you're feeling artistic, get creative using one of their sharpies and decorate your brown bag.  Hang it next to some of the other local artist renderings and enjoy your master epic :-)

After reading the "Best of Phoenix Awards", I had to try Amuse Bouche.  When I read the article and saw something about it in one of the Yelp talk threads I thought ~ "What is this, a French restaurant located on the west side that is actually good?"    Well I gave it two chances for my first visit was a 1-2 star experience and my second visit was better but not enough to raise my rating...    First experience ~ I wanted to try the "Best Quiche Lorraine in Phoenix".  What I got was a so-so swiss and bacon quiche that was runny and not evenly cooked.  The pie crust was exceptional but when I pointed out the runniness of the quiche to my server she stated "that's how it's cooked".  My quiche came with a side salad for which I was asked if I wanted some blue cheese crumbles on top and of course I agreed.  I did not know it was going to cost me an additional $1 for what should have been on top of the salad to begin with...  The salad was fresh, the candied pecans were good but the salad needed more dressing.  (see pic)  Aside from the runny quiche the service was deplorable.  Loud 80's big hair band rock was coming from the kitchen area and filtered through this little "French Restaurant". My server did not know her menu and stated that my quiche was egg-less when I pointed out it was too runny.  My ice tea ran dry a couple of times due to my server and the cook eating in the kitchen.  It was somewhat gross because they were cooking other peeps meals while eating theirs... No hand washing in between, yeeuuh!    Second visit ~ I made sure no one in the kitchen area was eating and cooking at the same time.  I was also glad to get a different server this on visit even though I could not believe the other lame-o server was still there.  This server knew the menu very well and was very attentive with his service.  After reading the Yelp reviews I tried their Cabernet Burger.  It was more cabernet than burger...  You could not taste the beef and the caramelized onions made this burger too mushy for which the bun could not hold up to it.  The French fries were pre-frozen and were not good even with the onion aioli...  I had HIGH hopes for this west side French Bistro but their food and service fell flat like a French Beret...

Belfiore's Italian Ristorante is very good, authentic Italian. They have a very large menu and everything is made from scratch. Their food taste like they are from the "north east", which is where the very best American Italian food is made in the US.    When you walk in, you first see their bakery. Moma Mia! They have different types of cannoli's, biscotti's, cheese cakes, tortelli's, panna cotta's, all kinds of wonderful Italian deserts.   They have a quick dinning area for lunch. You can order a lot of single items ala carte for eat in or take out. They have a dinning area in the back for larger lunch crowds and dinner. This is not a fine dinning restorante, so there are no frills and is a very basic dinner, but great food at reasonable prices.  I highly recommend their penne pasta and shrimp with vodka sauce.  Any pasta with their vodka sauce is recommended. They have the best vodka sauce I've found in the Phoenix market. Get a side of their home made sausages, yum. Their salads are a bit "cheesy" but again, it's not fine dinning. There service can be a bit slow sometimes but they are very friendly.   This is a place I recommend to my friends when they are looking for really good Italian at a reasonable price.  I think you would enjoy, so try it.

NoRTH is a great place to go for lunch or happy hour if your near Kierland. This is one of the better Fox restaurants with great food, fantastic service with a somewhat trendy northern Italian decor.  We miss their location on the west side on 67th.  They offer a lighter side of Italian cuisine with an emphasis on freshness. This is not the place to go if your looking for the heaver side of Italian with loaded meaty sauces and carb-o-roma items galore.  They offer some classic carb loaded dishes and pizzas. But for the most part they offer several wonderful dishes on the lighter side with loads of fresh grilled seafood, chicken and veggies.    Their zucca chips or bruschetta with prosciutto and crescenza cheese are great starters with a glass of wine. The baked ziti bolognese with spinach, ricotta & mozzarella cheese is delish,  The pasta with butternut squash is also very good.  I always order their grilled chicken sandwich with a side of seasonal grilled veggies or their ahi tuna salad which is devine.    Their happy hour is fantastic with bargains on drinks and several apps. They have great service and will accommodate most special request for those with special dietary needs.

I think this place has the better butter burger! (Say that three times really fast) Culver's, sure it's another fast food joint but they have great food and exceptional service! They offer a more diverse menu than most places.  It kind of a cross between a Burger joint and the Market Place.  In addition to burgers they offer things like fried cod, fried chicken, pot roast, chopped steak and fried shrimp.  They also offer a selection of different cooked veggies as sides.  But it's all about the burger for me.  The Bacon Deluxe served with two fresh, never frozen, beef patties seasoned well cooked to almost perfection with hot-melty-cheesy goodness, two slabs of bacon, served up hot and fresh on a lightly buttered bun with lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo and pickles.  Now you can create any type of burger you want so don't let their menu deter you from ordering something you would like that may not be on the menu.  They have those crinkle fries and great onion rings.  My family loves their fried cheese curds (little balls of cheese fried, imagine that).  You can get either one covered with chili and cheese if you wish.  Some people go to this place just for the frozen custard but I recommend getting their lemon ice with blue berries! Less filling and really refreshing and tasty!  We've also got one of their frozen custard cakes for a B-Day and it was gone in less than 5 mins!  Here's a Culver's Secret:  When ever you get a french fry that is longer than seven inches (laugh first, then read on) show it to one of the Culver peeps.  They may give you a free frozen custard in trade for that seven incher! (it's a promo they run every now and then) Also for those on a budget, order the kids combo you'll get a burger, fries and a drink with a free custard!

I was sooooo excited going to REI the other day to get a new Portable Spectrum Analyzer that sweeps 24GHz in 1 second quickly detecting transmitting electronic surveillance devices!  Heck YEAH!!    Oh wait just a minute, this is not the Research Electronics International store.... It's the Recreational Equipment Incorporated store.    All kidding aside this place Rocks!  They have just about anything you could possibly need to make your next outdoor adventure more fun and safe.  This is a "go to place" for use when shopping for camping and hiking gear.  They have more things available online, but we can usually find what we need in this store.    Don't get "sticker shocked" while shopping.  Most of the items REI sells is top of the line equipment and gear.  Their prices are very comparable to what you would find online or at other Outdoor Sporting Good stores.  They also offers coupons and free shipping most of the time.    The staff at this REI is extremely knowledgeable, friendly and eager to help you find the right gear you need for which ever out door sport you enjoy.  They are also experts on local hiking and camping sites as well.   So the next time you need a new portable spectrum analyzer, don't come here :^)  However this is THE place to come for all of your hiking, camping, and most other outdoor sporting gear. I hope to see you there!

REI is with out a doubt one of the most reliable places to find high quality camping, hiking, outdoor fun gear you can find anywhere.   They are always one of our routine stops when planning an outdoor trip.  They seem to have the things their competitors can only order if needed.  One of the best things about REI is their shoe sale.  You can pick up great shoes/boots during their sale.   This last trip we picked up some new Keens that they were discontinuing for 50% off!    REI is a must stop by and shop when planning your next camping or outdoors trip!

I'm writing this update on Al-Hana to let everyone know they've made some changes recently and for the BEST!   The Baiz Market is pretty much the same.  It's a wonderful Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food market and THE BEST place to buy olives, oils, middle eastern spices and pita bread!!  2 for $1and it's fresh daily!   Al-Hana~ "take a deep inhale as you enter the Baiz market, awe...." It's the same wonderful aroma and quality of food but they've made some changes to their menu.  Yes, that's right I said menu.  They have menu's now!  They are nicely done with full color pics of most dishes so no more guessing and no need for an interrupter!  Their dishes have changed.  They've added rice to most of their dishes at no extra charge. In fact they lowered their prices on a lot of things and changed up a lot of their entries to include rice, hummus and garlic sauce!   The chicken and beef schawarma are both some of the best in town but I prefer the Shish Taook ~ two huge skewers of grilled to perfection chicken seasoned in taook spices on top of a large bed of seasoned and delicious rice served with hummus, mixed pickles, tomatoes and their garlic sauce.  It is a HUMONGOUS plate full of tasty goodness that comes with two fresh pitas on top.  It's enough food for two people, people!  So be ready to share.  Their garlic sauce and hummus are as good or better than anyone else's their Shish Taook will leave you wanting!  I also recommend getting some of their small meat, cheese or cheese with spinach pies, the small square ones that are folded, heated for an appetizer and share a plate of hummus.  Their small pies are full of flavor and the pie dough is awesome!!   Plan to par-ooze the market while you wait for your food.  Skip the pepsi coolers near the Al-Hana counter for your beverage and pick a beverage from the large coolers on the first aisle leading back to the produce.  This is where you'll find just about anything and everything from the middle east to drink.  Yes!  They still have the same wonderful team of two guys cooking and the young lady running 100 MPH taking orders and serving everyone all at once.  They have made some fantastic changes and they one of THE BEST places to go for your Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food fixes.  I hope to see you there!

The other day I was discussing options for lunch with a colleague near the Glendale Mall and with loads of places to choose from we narrowed our search down to somewhere that serves fresh ingredients with a Mediterranean or Greek flair ~ Pita Jungle seemed to be our best option!  This Pita Jungle is ALWAYS busy and there is a reason why.  They serve delicious food and give fantastic service!   We like their Roasted Bell Pepper Hummus ~ Chickpea puree with roasted red bell peppers and their tahini sauce with fresh garlic and lemon juice.   We also like their (ever so becoming famous) Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus ~ Chickpea puree with cilantro, jalapeno and their tahini saucem with fresh garlic and lemon juice and topped with a little pico de gallo.  We will almost always order either Hummus and pitas extra to go for munchies later or the next day.  This is a must do from me to you!! You won't regret it.  They have very good salads especially their Mediterranean Chicken with grilled chicken, lettuce, veggies, roasted bell peppers, etc with feta cheese and pine nuts. Yum! We also like their Carribean salad which is basically a fruit salad with pineapples, oranges, grapefruit, apples, strawberrys, watermelon etc on top of some mixed greens, topped with shredded coconut, raisins and a strawberry vinaigrette. Something really fresh and doesn't way you down afterwards.   Of course they have Pita's beef, chicken, steak and tuna ~ what no lamb? They also offer Wood Fired Pizza's, burgers and Combo Platters with fresh Mediterranean dishes served with fish, chicken and beef, etc. They have many menu options to choose from, so have fun ordering and sample everything!   They are a very consistent 3+ to 4 star rating, although with some minor changes to their menu to include lamb and a few other more popular Mediterranean dishes they could easily go to a 4+ to 5 star rating.  I hope to see you there on my next visit!

This is by far one of the (if not the) best places to see the latest cinema flicks in the Phoenix metro area.  Our family loves this place and their are some pretty good restaurants in the immediate area so you can make it an eventful evening with your family.  Friendly staff, the place is always clean and it still looks new.  They have the latest digital sound and video which makes the 3-D totally awesome to watch!  They have comfy seats with adjustable arms and plenty of leg room which is so relaxing to me. Their snack, pop corn and drinks are all "good theater worthy" and they have that special cup you can get for repeat customer to get a discounted soda.  This a great place to watch the latest flicks with friends and family.  What would make this a 5+ you ask? A nice glass of chardonnay or merlot before the movie :-)

Time for an update on this Harkin's in the Norterra Shopping center.   If you haven't been to the Harkins, why not? What are you waiting for?    It's a wonderful theater, very kid friendly and adult friendly as well!  The employees are great and they can be entertaining at times, in a good way.    So what kind of movie watcher are you?   Are you the "lone ranger" and will go alone to watch a flick?   Are you the "family guy/gal" that has everyone wearing a Harkins shirt to get free popcorn and some theater drink cups ready for some refills?  Are you the "date night" person that is out having fun hoping you won't smile with some popcorn stick in your teeth?   Regardless of who you are, this Harkins is the theater for you!   I hope to see you there.

5 Stars!!!  This place is a MUST "stop by and try" if you haven't already!   It's in somewhat of a convenient location if your in this area of downtown, near the court house.  Nicole is fantastic, despite what some lefties might write about her, and she makes some of the best sub style sandwiches you'll find anywhere near downtown.  She welcomes everyone including the left winged misguided souls :-)  Selections, after you par-ooze her menu on the back wall take a look at some of the more creative specials posted down in front.  I chose the bitches bitch, which was the most awesome roast beef 10.5 inch sub with different kinds of peppers and cheese on a toasted sesame seed role.  It was DELISH!   My friend Rand had a hot pastrami hero with some extra spicy mustard.  He enjoyed it and her despite the fact she was packing some heat, literally :-)  Stop by and see Nicole and try one of her deli sandwiches!   You will enjoy it and look forward to coming back to see her again.

This Wildflower Bread Company store is fantastic ~ a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or even dinner!  I love a good cup of soup with a side salad or a half sandwich for lunch.  If there is a Wildflower close by, that's usually my pick of places to go when given other options based on their consistent good food and service.  This Wildflower seems to be one of their best in the Phoenix market.  ***CAUTION*** don't park directly in front of the restaurant!!  The shopping center parking lot is designed poorly so there is a lot of traffic buzzing in front of this Wildflower with CRAZY DRIVERS!!!  They drive like they are insane and all 15 minutes late getting back to work or going to their movie.    Restaurant ~ they are conveniently located just of the north 101 loop and I17hwy in the Deer Valley Towne Center.  The restaurant is always very clean and the servers are super quick to clean up empty tables to waiting customers.  It's not one of their fancier restaurants but the atmosphere is welcoming and friendly.    Service ~ they are very quick and friendly.  They are knowledgeable about what they sell and will help you answer any questions you have about their menu, breads and pastries.  Food ~ almost everything on their menu is either 4 or 5 stars.  I like their  Turkey Breast & Brie sandwich on their herb bread and their  Grilled Turkey Pastrami on caraway rye.  Both are DELISH and served with either chips, slaw or their corn salad!  Salads choices: Mediterranean salad or try their new seasonal salad ~  Fiery Butternut Squash salad is very different and a flavor-fest for your taste buds. Soups vary by day but if available both their Artichoke & Chicken Florentine and their seasonal Autumn Pumpkin soups are very good.  Their are several places to choose when your craving soup, salad or a sandwich so consider going to this Wildflower.  You won't be disappointed and in fact you will probably start planning your next visit to the Wildflower.  I hope to see you there.

Meh, I've experienced much better...  We used to frequent this Star Bucks a lot until Press Coffee opened near by.  We wanted to top off a great evening with a nice cup of Joe and Press Coffee was closed at 7pm and it was 7:30pm, oh no.... so we stopped by Star Bucks.  The service started off as a standard Star Bucks, quick to greet, though missing the smile this time, and ready to make what ever caffeinated concoction your craving for.  Coffee #1 ~ decaf and sugar free vanilla syrup. Barista stated, "we are out to decaf, would regular coffee be ok?" What??  No, we would like a decaf please.  Barista, "that will take 10 mins, so you will need to wait".  We asked, why are you out of decaf? Barista, "we stop making decaf earlier in the day". We did not want to wait so we opted for a leaded brew.  Coffee #2 ~ regular coffee with sugar free caramel.  I watched the Barista and noticed she used the white pump for the sugar free vanilla and the brown pump for the sugar free caramel. Star Bucks used one collar for sugar free and the other for sugared syrups.  As she poured our coffee I asked her to please make sure she gave us sugar free and not sugar. I noticed you used both colored pumps.  Barista, snippy ~ "we don't separate our flavorings like the other Star Bucks". She then dumped our coffee's out and using the same cups proceeded to use the same pumps again...    So we got both coffee's and proceeded to the cream bar and there was no cream...  So I asked a different barista for some cream.  She stated, "here ya go" and placed a gallon carton of cream on the bar and walked off.  Wowsers!  The coffee tasted burned as though it had been sitting there a while and we were for sure if we were drinking sugar free.  No sugar comma later so we are ok and don't plan to go back to this Star Bucks for a while...

Why do we keep going to Ketzal Mexican Grill?   Is it because of their location? Nope, just hop onto to the I17 and you can be at several restaurants in less then 10 mins.  Is it because of their prices? Nope  Is it because of their decor and ambiance? Big time NOPE  Is it because of their service? PA-LEAZE.... You can get better service at a taco bell!  I mean it too, just read through these Yelp reviews.  This place just doesn't get it. Your customers are telling you time and time again to treat us better.  Bar girl, please put down that cell phone and wait on your customers! Oh yeah, and stop waiting on us while your talking on that cell phone.  (it was almost comical!) Server dude, please be more attentive so I don't have to come looking for you to fill our drinks, chips or anything else. We need more interaction with you other than giving us our menus, taking our orders and then 1 hour later show back up to give us our bill.  Mr Manager/Owner, you seem like a nice guy every time we walk in but then you disappear behind the wall on your cell phone....   Is it because of their food?  May be.  My bride loves their Tacos Light ~ chicken in lettuce tacos. She orders this every time we go.  My son likes their burger and fries of course.  I do like their steak and chicken Fajitas and their chicken or carne asada enchiladas with their green or red chili sauces. Their salsa platter and chips are good and used to be complimentary but now they will cost ya!

If your craving Greek food but want something fast and good, this is your place! Typically going to Greek restaurants are like to going to a theater watching an Opera, very entertaining but can be slow at times.  Good Greek restaurants are no different, they can be very good places to eat and entertaining hearing "Oompa" yelled and the plates break but they can be very slow...  The Greek Pita is fast - Greek food. No frills, just good food!  They do not have Baba Ghanoush but their Hummus and Dolmas was pretty good.  We had a Greek Salad which had too much dressing. We also had their steak kebab plate with gyros and their chicken souvlaki plate. The steak kebab's were AWESOME, better than what I had at The Big Fat Greek restaurant in Tempe! Their gyros are the lamb and beef pressed meat, that is cooked in the traditional style which I'm not a big fan of, but that's what 90% of the Greek restaurants use any more....  Their souvlaki was also very good!  The services was very friendly and they seemed to be very busy even though they are tucked behind the Best Buy on Thunderbird. They are also kid friendly and offer some none Greek food for those with a plain pallet ;-)  I recommend The Greek Pita to my friends, no "oompa" needed though.  I hope you give them a try next time you are craving some Greek food while your in the North Phoenix area and don't have time to wait for an Opera!

Chipotle, you're either a fan or not a fan...  Like them or not they have a unique taste and style about how they serve fresh and quality ingredients.  The staff in this particular location is super friendly, but not overly so. Like when I show up two days in a row, they don't even look at you funny. They are very accommodating and their smiles are genuine.  You can get as creative as you want when ordering; your imagination and tummy size are your only limits.  If you ask for "a little" they give you a little, if you ask for "a little more" they oblige you there too.    The menu is simple. You can order tortilla chips, a burrito (your choice of meat, beans, salsas, opt for lettuce, sour cream, shredded cheese and, for an extra fee, guacamole,) a fajita burrito (which substitutes the beans for grilled sliced peppers and onions) a burrito or fajita burrito 'bol' (which are the same ingredients sans tortilla, in an Atkins (low carb)-friendly cardboard dish,) or tacos.   All besides the chips, your food is made fresh as it moves down a line of people putting this in, slapping that on, or wrapping it all up.) If you get there right when they open the chips are so fresh that the bags are still warm. They offer ice tea, fountain drinks and a small selection of bottled beers like Corona and Dos Equis.  The carnitas burrito bowl with grilled veggies, little rice, no beans, extra cilantro, both mild and hot sauce, cheese, sour cream and more cilantro on top is my fav. With chips and guac (and it's really good guac), it's a meal that keeps me full all day long.  WHOO HOO!!

If someone ask you, "have you been to FuNuGyz's yet" you should say one of only two things; 1) "why yes I've been there, it's a really great sports bars with really good food!" or 2) "nope, can't say I've been their but after reading this Yelp review I can't wait to go!"  I know what your thinking, ok this is yet another sports bar place that "claims" to have good food.  But this place has fresh food food prepared daily, none of that day old ~ frozen stuff served here as you'll find in most sports bars & restaurants throughout the Phoenix Metro.    For starters, the service was terrific! Amanda was one of the best servers ever, very attentive and helpful. This place is very clean and has a great ambiance.   One of my colleagues order the Gilled Mahi Mahi Taco's.  He said they were very good and filling.  The waitress stated they have 99 cent fish tacos on Friday's, so I know where to find him now on Fridays ;-)  My other co-worker had the Fat Boy ~ the name says it all.  It was a burger covered with blue cheese, veggies and BACON! It looked very good as well.  Someone recommended he get the Fat Boy and he loved it.   I had the the Fatty Melt ~ carb loaded burger that had "deliciousness" written all over it!  Check it out; it had a good, not great but good (needed more seasoning) burger topped with sauteed onions between TWO GRILLED CHEESE sandwiches! Oh yeah! You get to choose how you want your burger cooked and what type's of cheeses and toppings.  I chose their homemade chips, which I highly recommend over their fries! They are yummy!  I could not finish my Fatty Melt and chips, only ate half.  I would order this again in a heart beat (that is if I still have a heart beat after eating this burger) but share it with someone.   It's a great place to watch sports and hang out with your friends.  They have several specials throughout the week, so ask about them when you go.

We are always loking for places to eat that remind us of places we've lived or visited.  On this day it seemed like a good day for a Louisiana roast beef po-boy. We've been to Johnny's and to Pakway's several times in New Orleans and they both serve these amazing hot roast beef po-boys, dripping in sauce (mixture of beef au jus and mayo) topped lightly with a little lettuce, a few tomatoes and pickles all wrapped up in a very crunchy baguette role. So we Yelped po-boy places and Flavors of Louisiana popped up.  At first we had a hard time finding the Flavors of Louisiana.  Its set off the very busiy road in a small strip center, so look for their sign atop the building.  The Yelp directions will take you right to it.   Well we were hopping to find a roast beef po-boy like we would get at Johnny's or Parkway's in New Orleans but... not here unfortunately.  What we did find was an amazing shrimp po-boy and some excellent fried catfish topped with crawfish étouffée.   Both were very good and very similar to what we would find in New Orleans.  We also had some gumbo, which was good but missing the roux was too thin and missing the andouille sausage but had plenty of shrimp and crab.    This is a great place to eat if you're craving some southern fried catfish or even a fried shrimp po-boy!  You won't be disappointed!

The folks at Humble Pie know how to make very good pizza! They have two locations, but I can only vouch for this particular one.    Location ~ conveniently located across the street from the Desert Ridge Mall tucked away into the little strip center.  The restaurant is nicely decorated in a somewhat modern Italian style but the bar and patio are is the place to be!  Their bar extends outside onto the side walk and separates the dinning room from the patio. Nicely done.  Service ~ not outstanding but ok. I asked our server about the 2 for $20 deal and she stated that the special was good during the summer.  I inquired about any other offers and she stated there were none at this time.  But they do have a coupon you can print for a free pizza from their web site she failed to mention.  Our drinks never ran dry, they were very attentive to meet our needs.  Food ~ Started with a Caesar salad.  It was extremely fresh and the celery hearts made this salad more interesting with an added texture.  We had the chicken parmesan pizza with provolone, mozzarella and parm cheeses, breaded chicken on a red sauce.  It was very good. The thin crust held together very well even with the added ingredients.  Their brick oven cooks very hot so there was some great char-age around the edges.  We also had their S.O.P. pizza pie with sausage, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, ricotta and mozzarella cheese on a red sauce.  This was also an excellent choice!  The ricotta cheese and roasted red peppers gave this pie a very unique taste and high on the delish-o-meter.  They have some great beers and a modest wine selection for you to choose from.  I recommend dinning during their happy hour 3-6 to save some cash-ola on there beverages and apps. Don't forget to visit their web site to see if they have a coupon or special running.  It's a great place for pizza, salads, sandwiches and pasta's so hope to see you there!

Hale maui~ Maui Wowi Hawaiian Coffee & Smoothies for the most delicious cup of pure Kona coffee you will find any where around Phoenix!  Ho'omaika'i 'ana to Maui Wowi on brewing such a fine Kona roast that will leave you wanting more.  The Maui Wowi offers both pure Kona and blended brews and have both whole beans and ground to sell should you want to brew your own.  Sure you'll pay more for the pure cup of Kona goodness, but it's well worth it.  They wait to grind it until when you order it.  Then they use a java press to extract all of that Kona deliciousness into your cup.     They offer a wide variety of fresh cut fruit smoothies that are also very good and they offer hot and iced coco, some treats and other goodies.  They pack their fruit smoothies with more fruit than what you will get at most other places.    This is a place to add to your list of places around Phoenix that I need to try!    Mahalo nui loa.  A hui hou kakou, Aloha oe!!

We were excited to try Bryan's BM BBQ since we've heard so much about it and have had poor luck in finding good eats in Cave Creek.    It was an awesome day so we sat out side on their patio, which is what I would recommend.  You have to wait inline at a counter to order your food, which I'm OK with providing the line moves quickly.  Unfortunately we were behind some "lookie loos" that have never eaten BBQ before and had to have everything explained to them in detail...  IT'S BBQ, nothing fancy so order and move it!   I had ribs with baked beans and coleslaw.  Ribs were very good but had a bit too much sauce on them.  The beans were delicious and the coleslaw was terrible due to the olives and it was too dry.  I love olives but not in coleslaw!  My bride and son had pulled pork sandwiches with potato salad and fries.  The pulled pork was very good as were the fries however their potato salad had way too much dill. It was more of a "dill salad" with a little bit of potato.   We finished with fried apples with cinnamon, pepper corns and a dusting of sugar.  Sounded great but found it too greasy to eat.  Their ribs and pulled pork were good enough to leave you wanting more.    We are looking forward to our next visit to Bryan's so we can try their brisket, chicken and veggie style pulled squash! I recommend Bryan's to my friends, so stop by next time your in Cave Creek.

Our dog love this place!! They do a fantastic job dog sitting out pooch when she needs some playtime with other dogs or if we need someone to watch her when we travel!!   Our dog seems to like this place over the (larger pet day camps and hotels around Phoenix)!! The best way we can tell she prefers he Sonoran Desert Pet Resort over Pet(not so)Smart, she doesn't have that nervous shake when we take her in.  We don't have to drag her in, and in fact she drags us into the doors at Sonoran!! When we pick her up, you can tell she had loads of fun and she's tired from playing and she DOES NOT SMELL!!  We used to use the other places and she would come home stinky and you could tell she was ready to come home.  (LET ME OUT OF HERE!!)    This is becoming our dogs home away from home.  The staff here is very friendly, professional and you can tell they are genuinely interested in taking care of your pet.  You pet isn't just another ticket for them...   They rates are very reasonable!! Over night stays range between $33 - $43 depending on what type of room or kennel your dog prefers.  Their Daycare is very reasonable too! The Half Day Daycare up to 6 hours is probably the best deal at just $12 where as a full Day Daycare is $20.    They do watch cats too, but I have no idea what their rates are for cats.   This is an excellent place to bring your pooch whether it's just for a couple of hours, a day or over night!  The safety and security of your pet is there top priority.  I know my dog is looking forward to her next daycare/over night stay at the Sonoran Desert Pet resort!  Hopefully she will see your dog their too!

I went lunch the other day with some friends.  They wanted a good deli, however I don't think this exist in the far west Phoenix metro.  Someone  suggested Archie's so I thought, well it's been a while since my last visit which was not very good, so why not give them another try again.    They will usually start you off with a small dish of pickles however they did not bring us any on this visit.  I did not ask for them this time since I did not like them on my last visit.  I had their half pastrami sandwich on rye with a side of potato salad.   I was not asked if I wanted my bread toasted this time for some reason.  The bread needed to be toasted for the bread was dry and the crust was too tough to eat.  The pastrami was OK.  They buy their pastrami pre-cooked which makes it a little drier than at a place that cooks their own pastrami.  The potato salad is bland, so I would recommend ordering a different side.  I've had their cole slaw on a prior visit and it's also a bit bland, so you may want to go with fries.  They are not fresh, but might be a better option for a side.   All in all I find their prices way too high for the quality of food you get at Archie's. They might be the best option if your looking for a deli and your in this area.  I've been to Archie's a couple of times now and it has not changed.  This is a 2 star deli for me based on multiple experiences.

Ah-So Sushi & Steak is really a 2.5 star rating but only because my son loves the show the Chefs put on at your Teppanyaki grills.  If it was for my son giving you guys props this would be a 1 star rating.   Restaurant ~ yes this place is laid out weird, may be it's due to the location.  It's sort of a triangle-ish shape with the bar placed at the front door, the sushi bar away from the regular bar, which doesn't make sense, and then regular dinning to fill the triangle with the teppanyaki grills at the far end.  I looks a little worn which is surprising since this place is fairly new.  Service ~ this is where they could use some help. It's hit and miss depending on where you sit and which server you get. My last visit was at the sushi bar and the service was a complete miss. She gave my order to the one sushi chef that was the busiest, so I waited and chatted with the other two sushi blokes while waiting for the first chef to find my order. Why not let he pencil something new? But no sir, we need to find your original order so we don't make you two. (what!)  I reached for my glass of H2O and my glass was sticky! GROSS! I was going to ask for a manager but that's when my server apparently got lost somewhere in the triangle vortex of this place and did not see her again for 15 mins..  Food ~ Sushi menu is very plain with only a few options so I ordered their  special sushi roll with spicy scallops on top of a California roll and some Hamachi sashimi.  The sashimi was ok, it didn't look very good but there was not fishy smell so I ate it.  Their sushi roll was crazy funny looking. It was not cut even at all, fell apart and the spicy scallops were mushy.  Yuck! I could not eat it.    When we eat their teppanyaki grill, it's also a hit and miss depending on the cook your get.  Over all ~ Meh, I've experienced much better.

Need a hair cut, shave or a shoe shine?  This is the place to go, V's Barbershop at Norterra.  I've been going to this V's Barbershop for a while and they are always consistent and provide great service.    They are located, tucked behind the Paradise Bakery in the Norterra Shopping center.   Its a great location with plenty of places to eat lunch around them after your cut and shave.    They can get busy at times but they seem to keep up a brisk pace with their customers while not sacrificing the quality of their work.  So don't be alarmed when you go and you see three or four people ahead of you.  Take that time to get a free shoe shine while youre waiting.    All hair cuts include a shoe shine, a razor trim for your neck and then they throw a hot moist towel on your face while giving you a shoulder and neck massage.  The Barbers are all very friendly and experienced.  They can do just about anything to your hair but grow it.    So the next you need a hair cut, shave and a shoe shine, think about trying V's Barbershop at Norterra.  You won't be disappointed.

The menu features a wide range of Japanese favorites. I enjoyed the clear soup with mushrooms and scallions and shrimp and scallop skewer appetizer, a wonderful start to a meal of sushi.  The sushi menu offered many standards and creative choices. My colleague had sushi rolls, which they did not skimp on the meat and fillings. He also had some tempura, the servings of which are large, light and tasty.  I opted out for sushi and tried their sashimi instead.  I had Maguro (Tuna), Salmon, Hamachi (Yellow Tail), Mckajiki (Sword Fish) and Tako (Octopus).  It was all very good.   I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something different.  This is a great place for lunch at $11 for 3 rolls, soup and salad.

It's obvious that everyone that walks in the door here loves it. This is one of three Carolina's in the Phoenix metro.  I've wanting to try the original Carolina's near downtown but did not want to drive all the way down to "da ghetto" all "gangsta like" to eat some fast Mexican food.  I have been to both North and West locations and found them to be very good and consistent.    After standing in line to order like at a "taco stand" I sat down and noticed all the dishes coming out of the kitchen, and I started to almost drool.  Then my number was called and the funny urge to yell BINGO, but rather went up to the counter to get my piping hot Machaca Burrito with Papas and a side of chips and spicy salsa (served in styro-foam, ARGUE!!). While the salsa heat was almost too much for my taste buds, it was simply delicious and even took some home.   Holy cow, this was amazing for the price.  As so many others have mentioned their tortillas are simply delish!! The beans were a good consistency, not too runny, not to dry and the rice had a great flavor.  Again the food is a great value for the price.  In summary, despite that fact this place is NOT eco-friendly by using stryo-foam it is more over a place that is convenient off the 101 and Peoria if you're in the area looking for good, fast Mexican food. This is not necessarily a destination place to plan for but rather a place of convenience with tasty food.

Ha!  Joey's of Chicago is a total 5 star place to grab a fantastic Italian beef sandwich!  Despite what you may read in a few of the other reviews this place is a reliable 4 to 5 star experience.   You can count on it!  What the heck! who goes to a Chicago  style restaurant that is known for the hotdogs and Italian beef and orders a hamburger??  (Although I heard their hamburgers are burger-licious too)!  This place is locally owned by some very nice folks transplanted from the burbs of Chicago.  At least I know one of them is from Schaumburg, grew up there, at least that's what I heard while eavesdropping :-)  Seriously these folks are from Chicago and they know how to cook some great Chicago style hot dogs and some DELISH hot Italian beef!   It good enough to make to folks at Portillo's proud to have some respectable competition!     Oh but this not Portillo's, for their Italian beef is a little different but in a good way!  I had their Italian roast beef sandwich with hot peppers covered with melted provolone cheese dry with a side of dip. (Don't call it ausue... Haha, that's what the peeps from Arizona called it.  In Chicago it's simply called dipping sauce :-)  Anyways, my sandwich was DELISH! The folks with me also had the same thing but they had the sandwich dipped and the other got their's wet.  I don't care for soggy bread but they seemed to like it all the same.    Hungry for a fantastic italian beef sandwich or a super chicago style hotdog Joey's is a great place! It's almost guaranteed you'll meet some other folks from the Chicago area dinning here.  I'm not from Chicago but I travel there all the time and I know you'll have a 4 to 5 star experience.  I hope to see you there!

Lola Coffee is a great coffee shop with plenty of room to move around and delicious coffee and pastries.    Daniel Wayne, founder of Lux Coffee before he sold it and opened Lola Coffee.  It's located not far from Lux and it's a nice change when you need some additional room to meet with someone.  Their coffee is house roasted off site and very good.  They have different varieties of coffee depending on the seasonality and availability.  They have a small selection of cookies and pastries but it's their tarts that set them apart from other places.  Their tarts are divine and luscious.  They also offer some unique cold beverages such as fresh agave lemonade and a variety of iced /hot teas.   The Coffee may be a little better at Lux but Lola doesn't have near as many creepy look-e-loo peeps that stare at you while you're trying to enjoy your cup of joe :-)

Went to Cartwright's in Cave Creek with some real good friends to enjoy a "date night" without the kiddo's.  We've dined there before and really enjoyed it so we were looking forward to sharing this experience with some good friends.     The restaurant is decorated as a Sonoran Ranch House, it has sort of a "Western Loungee" vide to it.  It's not formal dining, but somewhat intimate and quiet with a "YEEHA" in there some where.  I think next time we come to Cartwright's I'm going to do it right and dress in my finest western attire, spurs and all!  They have a very nice bar for you and your friends to mozzie on up to for a tasty libation prior to dining.  The women had Prickly Pear Margatini's which they apparently enjoyed since they order a second round.  One of the guys had a Strawberry Daiquiri... (no comment, you know who you are...)  Myself and the other guy had manly drinks, Poquito Picante Margarita's with fresh Jalapenos in the drink and on the rim with light salt.  Wow, what a burning sensation at first drink, but man it was good! It gave new meaning to "hot lips", and our brides agreed with after a quick kiss :-)  That's probably why they ordered a second round, their lips were burning baby!     We had reservations since there were six of us and ate in the little room with the Elk head staring down at you above the fireplace while you ate.  This is the only reason why I'm giving Cartwright's 4.5 stars and not 5 because I'm a bit of a clean freak.  Don't take this wrong because I absolutely love greasy spoons, but they have to be clean.  I ask our waiter how often to they clean the Elk's head and he said he did not know when the last time it had been cleaned.  I'm not being a weirdo here, but yuck ~ dirty, dusty Elk hair and dead skin flakes floating in the air while I'm eating dinner kind of creep-ed me out.  It did not bother anyone else though...  Our salads, appetizers and entries were all extremely fresh, high quality.  They offer wild game, grass fed~organic beef and the most unbelievable seafood.  One of the coolest facts about Cartwright's is they purchase all of their produce, meats and dairy from local purveyors including seasonal items from the desert.  They have a very good wine list that will compliment your meal very well.    Between the six of us we had a sampling of almost everything they offered.  I really like their Elk Tenderloin, NY Strip and Chilean Sea Bass.  They have some very good deserts as well including Campfire S'mores, Cheesecake, Creme Brulee, or my fave was the Chocolate Ranch House Cake with a Mexican chocolate Kahlúa sauce, yum!  Great place to dine with someone special or invite some friends. Have some fun and make it a "Western" night out, yeeha!

***WARNING, READERS DECRETION IS ADVISED***  (you must read this first part fast and in your "deep" voice) This review may contain words that might be considered unprofessional and worthless. This review is not recommended for reading by those that take life too seriously, wound too tight and don't see the humor in the small things. This review is intended for readers that enjoy using Yelp only.....   Hot Lips!!  Ouch!   Wow, I've not had a chance to try Dutch Bros before after driving by them many times due to the long lines.  Last week I wasn't in a rush so I pulled in behind four other cars thinking my wait for caffeine would be a while. To my surprise the wait was only 5 mins! The barista dude talked me into trying their monthly special, Irish Latte ~ silky blend of Irish Cream, milk and coffee.  I ordered it sugarless with 2%, no problemo.  The service was excellent! Fast, friendly and he gave me a frequent flyer card for my future trips. He explained how they roast their own coffee and they offer lots of other options ~ smoothies, soda's and juice.  My coffee smelled awesome and I could not wait to take a sip.  But wait a minute... Apparently Dutch Bros uses a coffee cup lid I'm not familiar with.  I looked at it and immediately thought about my son's "sippy cup" when he was a toddler.  This thing has a "nipplessense" feature about it that has a large hole!  So I stared at it for a while and starting laughing my face off, LMFO, and thinking about two iconic actors of the early 90's that imparted so much wisdom on our youth at that time ~ Beavis and Butthead!    Beavis: "that coffee lid looks like my old sippy cup" Butthead: "what do you mean?" Beavis: "it has a nipple..." Butthead: "uh huh huh huh.. you said nipple, uh huh huh huh..."  After I regained my composure, I smiled really big and took a sip of my Irish Latte from Dutch Bros. Ouch! Hot Lips! It took me a little while to figure out how to drink my coffee without burning my lips in this coffee lid.  The coffee was smooth with the perfect balance of sugarless Irish Cream and 2%. It was wonderful!  After it cooled down a bit I was able to enjoy my latte without burning my lips on the "sippy cup" lid. The large hole in the top of the lip was made for peak coffee guzzledge, after it cools down : -)

We had a great experience at this Blu Burger Grille location the other day, so they are a 3.5 to a 4 star rating and nothing "blue" about it ; -)   Restaurant ~ as stated in other Yelp reviews, this place is literary "blue" everywhere. Even if your not a fan of the blue color, the blueness starts to fade after a while and a few drinks.  It is conveniently located in the Park West Plaza ~ 101hwy & Northern in front of the movie theater.  Service ~ was great. Our server knew their menu well and was able to answer all of our questions.  She was very attentive to our needs and kept our drinks filled.  Food ~ they offer Angus beef  and turkey patties for their standard burgers.  They also have a build your own burger where you can choose grass fed beef and bison as well.  We went with the grass fed beef and the bison burgers.  The meat was cook very well and was mouthwatering delicious.  We chose their onion and white buns for our burgers.  They were a bit too big for the burgers but tasted ok.  They have several choices for burger toppings to choose from.  Your burger comes with fries, but I upgraded my fries to zucchini fries.  Both were unappetizing and needed to be doused in catchup or ranch dressing. Their onion rings and sweet potato fries were not really any better.  Their salad was very fresh and flavorsome.   Side note ~ I love blue cheese on my burgers, but if you order their grass fed beef or bison burgers you may want to skip ordering the blue cheese because it can mute the taste of the beef.  You don't want that beefy goodness to restrained or diminished in any way.   Recommendation ~ give this Blu Burger Grille a try next time your in the area and craving for a tasty burger.  Go for the grass fed beef or the bison, skip the fries and go for a side salad.  You won't be disappointed.

Upon entering this Total Wine & More I thought to myself;  At first I was afraid... I was petrified Kept thinkin' I could never live without this place by my side Then I spent so many nights Just thinking how Bevmo did me wrong And I grew strong And I learned how to get along  I found the Sommelier and said; And so you're back.... from outer space I just walked in to find you here, with that look upon your face I should have brought more cash with me I should have realized nothing's for free If I had known for just one second you'd be back to teach me  Go on now, go... walk down the aisle Just turn around now Cause you're expertise is needed here some more  Weren't you the one who tried to break me with good by? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I, I will survive For as long as I know how to drink, I know I'll stay alive I've got all my life to live And I've got all my wine  to drink I'll survive I will survive As long as Total Wine is right here by my side i'll survive  Hey hey  (peace out!)

This is the second time to visit this Fletcher Tire.  We needed a new set treads so we called them to price compare to some of the other local tire dealers.  They always seem to have some kind of specials going on and they add additional perks when you purchase tires from them, like free oil changes.  Product ~ They were able to find me the tires I was looking for and price matched their competition.    Service ~ They were able to transfer the tires I needed to this Fletcher Tire, which is located close to where I live.  They called me within three hours to let me know my tires had arrived and they were ready for me to bring in my car. They started right a way when I pulled up and in less than 30 mins I was off with a new set of treads!  Perks ~ They found a manufactures rebate and applied it to my bill without asking.  They gave me some free future oil changes, some coupons and deals on other services they offer. Free tire rotation and inspection as needed.  I recommend you try Fletcher's Tire and Auto Service.  They are great to do business with.

I've been some what apprehensive writing this review about the Buzzberry Coffee & Smoothies.  Well my apprehensiveness turned into procrastination because I sooo want to support this small business by writing them a stellar review but after repeated mishaps and poor service during different visits I've come to the conclusion the Buzzberry is what it is ~ Meh, I've experienced better.    Good~ great location, drive thru, coffee and espresso is OK ~ average, smoothies are made with organic fruit and they offer several energy and nutrional sup's if you like that kind of thing.  The decor is cute and whimsical.    Not so good~ the ice tea is elf service.  It sits in an urn for who knows how long before they brew more.  It always taste a little stale and sort of bitter.  They have WIFI, however it's password protected so you have to request the password.  Some of the comfy seating has too much wear and needs to be replaced.    Bad & Ugly~ the service here sucks especially for the prices they charge. Maybe it's my timing but every time I've been to the Buzzberry there are these really young and uncaring girls working.  They are not attentive to their customers nor do they seem to care about this business becoming successful.  Cleaning ~ this place needs a good cleaning.  We did not enjoy our last visit for all of the crumbs, dirt and what not on the floor and tables.  Oh yeah and the girls behind the counter are busy yapping away at each other rather than picking the place up. I can better coffee for less at 32 & Shea...  My last visit I asked to speak to the mgr or owner and I was told she was not in.  I asked them to speak to anyone in charge.  Both girls stated they were in charge so I told them about my disappointments in my repeated visits.  They both just stared at me like deer in a hand light.    Good luck if you going to try the Buzzberry Coffee and Smoothie!

We have been looking for a place that serves good, North East - New York style bagels with lox and a deli. Glad to say we finally found one, Hot Bagels & Deli! They are a very small place right off the Carefree Hwy and I17 and frequently busy especially on the weekends.   They have a good variety of bagels served hot or cold breakfast style with several cream cheeses, bacon, sausage, egg, cheese (anything you want on it). They also have a very good deli with a good selection of deli meats, salads and lox. They serve both hot and cold sandwiches, wraps and they have some sweet pastries too. They also serve Kona blend coffee, which is ok and better than most coffee's.   The only thing missing from this New York style bagel place is the smoked white fish, home made hot pastrami and the back/white cookies. I highly recommend getting the "slice nova" on a plain or toasted everything bagel! Lox, tomatoes, onions, capers and cream cheese, yeah baby!!  I recommend the Hot Bagels and Deli to my friends and hope you give them a chance next time your around the Carefree and I17 hwy area. I think you will enjoy it.

Ok, forget the smoked white fish and the black/white cookies... this place doesn't need them!   This Hot Bagels and Deli is one of the Best places you will find anywhere around Phoenix for tasty bagels!  They are bagelicious!   If you don't believe me, then just stop by on a Saturday or Sunday morning and watch all of the bagel seeking peeps come into this place by the droves!  Yes, it's a great people watching place too :-)  A good bagel must be somewhat light and yet chewy on the inside and boiled and crisp on the outside.  This place knows how to make bagels better than most hands down. I hope you will give them a try.  Maybe I will see you there?!

When you're looking for a place to eat with not much time but you're not willing to sacrifice taste just for a "quickie meal", In-N-Out is a great place to go!    Although many places claim they have "The Best Burgers" in town, the brutal reality is most places don't!! The coolest thing about In-N-Out; they don't talk the talk but they do walk the walk by delivering good eats consistently whether your in LA or Phoenix.    Their menu is smaller than most places and some peeps think they are limited to what they can order, but that just means they have not really experienced the true uniqueness of In-N-Out like a lot of us have ordering from their "secret menu"!!   My son usually gets a 1X1 with catchup, fries and a Neapolitan Shake ~ strawberry, vanilla and chocolate blended together.  My bride usually orders a protein style 1X1 burger with catchup & mustard and grilled onions with a diet.  For me, it's a 2x2 or 3x2 animal style with extra toast and well done fries!  DELISH!! The person with me today had a 5X5 aka; the "take a nap afterwards" burger with hot melty cheesy well done fries and black and white shake!  It looks AWESOME!  They have never got my order wrong despite me ordering something cooked a different way with each visit.  They have that cute red and white decor/packaging and include an inscription like "John 3:16" and "Proverbs 3:5", which is awesome!  So the next time you're ready for fast food, don't make the mistake and go to just any burger place, go to In-N-Out! Order something from their "secret menu" but don't tell anyone...

Cartel is not your run of the mill coffee shop.  They have exceptional coffee, teas and offer a variety of breakfast choices, sandwiches and some salads.  They are conveniently located in the heart of downtown, within walking distance.  This is a sister location from their main coffee lab in Tempe.  They roast their beans in Tempe and ship to this location daily to ensure a fresh and delicious brew.  Like most other coffee places, they are very selective in the coffee they buy for their customers.  They seem to be proficient roasters for their coffee is smooth and ambrosial.   I like their breakfast especially the Big Ben ~ English muffin with scramble-ee eggs, bacon, tomato topped with harvarti cheesy goodness and some yummy chipotle aioli!  You'll need a couple of napkins : -)  They also have a couple of salad choices ~ cob, spring mix and tuna,  which is what I will try on my next visit.   Suggestion: If you're going to meetings downtown, stop buy and pick up a great cup of joe at Cartel on your way to your destination, then go back to Cartel after lunch.  They usually have "pastry happy hour" in the afternoons with half priced bakery goods.  Take some delicious delights home with you to share with your family after dinner.

Off Da Hook Soul Food is a solid 3 to 3.5 stars but I will upgrade them to 4 stars based on the exceptional service we received. Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The same thing holds true for places to eat and that includes this place.  They are a very small "hole in the wall" kind of dinner.  If you blink twice while driving past them you may miss them.  They are a nice alternative to the usual dinner's in Phoenix.   They offer some of the basic Soul Food options with almost everything fried of course ~ pork chops, catfish, chicken.  No oxtail, rabbit, ham hocks or chitlins though.  Not that I order chitlins but it's hard to beat good rabbit and ham hocks when dinning at a Soul food place!  They offer some of the more popular Soul food types of sides such as collard greens, mac-n-cheese, yams, beans & rice, cabbage, and some others.  However they don't offer fried or cooked okra or turnips, which are Soul food staples.  Corn bread comes with your meal and they offer Kool Aide in addition to soda and tea.  I had the fried Pork Chops with sides of mac-n-cheese and red beads in rice.  The breading on the Pork Chop was DELISH! It had a lot of crunch, with an excellent balance of seasoning that was "finger licking good".  The sides were ok, nothing special but good.  I wanted their Collard Greens, but they weren't ready which was unfortunate ~ maybe next time.   We also had their fried chicken and waffles.  WOWsers!  The fried chicken had the same or similar breading as did the Pork Chop.  The chicken was fried to almost  perfection and their Waffle had an great taste that wasn't too heavy and complimented the fried chicken very well.  Look out LoLo's!!  This place is just as good if not better!

I've been to the Olive Tree Mediterranean Market and Grill a couple of times now for lunch.  This is small Mediterranean market with a restaurant on the side.    This review is for the grill area.   On my last visit I ordered and Gyros combo, which was their featured item  of the day at $6.99 for a Gryos, fries and drink which was posted outside.  I asked if I could get the combo but substitute the fries for a small salad?  She said "yes, but there is an additional charge of $3"...    Since a really wanted a side salad and not fries I paid the extra charge.      I decided to order just the Gyros sandwich and a small side salad.  She stated "that will be $11.45, did you want a drink with that?  I stated "I thought a drink came it", she stated "no, that's an additional charge"...  This place is way too expensive for the quality of food you get when compared to any of the Greek restaurants around Phoenix.  The upside to this somewhat expensive lunch was the food was very good.  My Gyros was just OK, but my Greek salad was very good!  It was also served on a glass dish with real flatware which is a plus for me.

I'm surprised there is not a review already about this Street of New York in Anthem.  But then again, most people won't complain about there experiences and just not go back. Hense ~ the purpose of this review.   The good~ after all there is always some "good" in just about everything.  This is an awesome location in Anthem.  They are located in the Frys center.  They are reasonably priced compared to other places with similar food.  They never have a wait to be seated.  Te food is not great but it's not too bad either.   The bad~ the service in this place is soooooo slow.  Whether you're dinning solo, with two or as a family the wait is the same ~ slow-ville X2. The staff is not very accommodating and heaven forbid if someone comes in they know while they are serving you.  They will make more time for their friends than you.    So why give them 2 stars and not 1 star?  Because the dinning options in Anthem are pathetic and I am not a pessimist but rather a critical optimist in hopes they will get their act together some day...

I know, I know....  it's a chain restaurant and their are soooo many Chili's around the Phoenix metro, why would I write a review on this one?    Because it's the closest one to Anthem and I am hoping the Yelp "fairies and gods" will listen to my review and influence the mgmnt team!!  This place has all of the ingredients in becoming THE CHILI'S of all Chili's.   Great location, customers and little to no competition!!   So what's the problem?  The consistency of their service and food are deplorable.  Some visits they are well staffed with friendly and attentive servers and on other visits they little to no staff and they seem disgruntled and cantankerous.   The grub~ We always have to send something back or they will forget something.  It's gotten so bad we have resorted to ordering just soup and salad at this location and they seem to find a way to mess that up too.  The soup is either over seasoned or under seasoned, and they don't look at their salads close enough when hey make them.  We found lettuce cores in both salads on our last visit...  I'm pleading to the Yelp gods to influence the mgmnt in this restaurant.  I've tried to listen to their excuses and apologies, give them advise, and even coaching but they keep making the same mistakes...     At least the beer is cold, but you might have to wait to get it even if your the only person there.

You just never know what you're getting until you look under the hood...  Friend of mine brought me here for lunch the other day and not being a good Yelper I did not look up any of the reviews prior to going.  To my surprise when I pulled up to this place yes it looks a little dumpy however the inside is really nice.  The ambience, service, and food were all very very nice.    Food; For starters you must try the lemongrass soup and also their spring rolls.  I recommend you get Phad Thai or go with chicken and/or tofu green curry or red curry.  Their green curry sauce is one of the best in Phoenix.  Everything we tried was D Lish!  Restaurant;  Like I stated earlier, don't judge a book by its cover, The restaurant is well decorated, the decor is very nice and the ambience is nice.   We found the service on this day excellent.  Our server was very attentive and she was very knowledgeable about their menu.  She made some great recommendations.    After reading other Yelper reviews it would appear that this place has listened to some of their feedback.  I found this place to be a little hidden gem in Phoenix.    I'm looking forward to my next visit and I hope to see you there very soon.

The Cosmo is one of our new favorite Casinos to stay at while visiting sin city!  They are really confidently located in the center of the strip, so they are close to everything!  They have decent gaming areas and very friendly dealers.  Their rooms are sublime, very cozy and comfy.  They are very spacious with great views.   They have an excellent spa, so my bride tells me :-) They also have loads of super duper places to eat/drink!   Some of our very favorite restaurants in Vegas are in the Cosmo!   Just yelp places to eat on the strip and you'll find most of the restaurants in the Cosmo with high Yelper ratings.    Kid friendly, nope but that's what a sitter/nanny is for!  This is a perfect place for a couple to indulge themselves in some fun and frolic!   I'm looking forward to my next trip to the Cosmopolitan!  I hope to see you at the tables!

We went to El Chorro Lodge for brunch the other day and what a wonderful experience we had. There are a lot of reviews already written about this Arizona landmark restaurant so here's another review to consider if you're thinking about trying El Chorro Lodge.  Restaurant ~ they have one of the best dining patio's in the metro!  Great views of the desert and mountains, everything is shaded with umbrella's and they have the misters going full throttle this time of year.  There is usually some light entertainment in the evenings on the patio.  The restaurant is somewhat a "mission style" clean lines, exposed ceiling rafters and white walls with some nice art work.  It's smaller inside than what most people might think, so you will most definitely want to use Open Table or call them to make reservations before going.    Service ~ good servers here. Most of them are very attentive to your needs and very accommodating.  There were a few times we saw some of the servers blast past customers without a "pardon me" while going to and fro to the patio.   Food ~ WARNING, eater's discretion is advised here!  Yes they serve you  sticky buns throughout the day and they are sooooo good and very addictive!  You'll want to order more but dont!  It will spoil you appetite before you get your main course.  These tasty little buns or goodness will swell in your tummy so just enjoy one (or two) that way you'll have something to look forward to on your next visit.    On this last visit I had smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, capers and some other goodies.  It was awesome!  It came with a side of hash brown potatoes and toast.  We also had their Creme Brulee french toast and ordered a side of bacon.  This sounded much better than what it tasted.  They use thick challah bread that must soak for a very long time, for this french toast tasted more like and eggie bread pudding.  The apple wood bacon was slightly over cooked but still tasty.  We also had their  eggs benedict which was delish.  You have your choice of proteins with your EB ~ canadian bacon, smoked salmon, lump crab or beef tenderloin and served with asparagus.    El Chorro Lodge has a great ambiance, good food and service.  It is what we expected most of the restaurants would be like prior to moving to Phoenix.  This is a great place to go with friends and family.  I recommend dining on their patio for brunch or a late dinner.  Hope to see you there sometime!

Sure Smashburger is a "chain burger place" but that doesn't necessarily mean they act nor serve food that taste like any ordinary burger chain restaurant...  They are much better than many other fast food places and well worth the few extra bucks you'll pay for a good burger and fries.  We tried their Arizona Smashburger with fried pickles. The burger was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning and temperature!  It came with fresh guac, jalepenos, chipotle mayo, other veggies with Habanero cheese served on a chiptole bun.  It was fantastic! The fried pickles were also a nice change to fries. Crispy with lite batter and some ranch dressing for dipping.  You've got to try these!  We also had the Classic Smashburger with their Smashfries. Again the burger was cooked exceptionally well with just the right balance of seasoning and temp.  Their Smashfries are fries tossed with olive oil, salt, garlic and rosemary. The seasoning was spot on! We've ate fries that are very similar at Diablo Burger in Flag, but the fries at Smashburger are better balanced with rosemary/garlic and salt.  Recommendation: order a create your own 1/3 lb Smashburger with which ever bun, but ask for them to toast it ~ they will! Then add an extra 1/3 lb patty and request them to cook it the temp you want it ~ they will. Choose the cheese of your choice with either smashsauce or chipotle mayo and then get all the veggies including jalapenos. Your total will be $6.99 for a 2/3 lb burger of deliciousness that will leave you planning your next trip to Smashburger!  Don't forget to try their fried pickles and down everything with a cold bottle of beer.

Wowser's! Finally a fantastic place to eat in Glendale at La Chalet! We had an amazing dinning experience here Sunday.  After reading some of the Yelp reviews, I bookmarked this place as a "must try" and I'm so glad I did!  We walked in and immediately noticed how cute and quaint this restaurant was decorated.   There are two sections on the restaurant, a dining room area for families and the other a "bar and lounge" area that has a warm ambiance.  Since this trip was a family adventure we were seated right next to the Ice Cave, where my son could watch the TV's in the bar area, making the crepes, which was very was very cool.  They have very entertaining "French" signs and posters on the walls.  They also offer entertainment some nights and have special entertainers scheduled for reservations.   Appetizer: Traditional Flammenkuchen ~ "Oven roasted tart with sour cream, swiss cheese, bacon and onion".  It looked like a pizza at first, but don't be fooled! The flavor and texture get you quickly. The crispy "tart" and unique flavor of the dough itself is enough to party with the sour cream love affair your mouth is having.   Meal: Berg ere crepe (ratatouille with goat cheese melted on top), Roquefort crepe (melted blue cheese topped with caramelized apples and crumbled walnuts), and a Roasted Chicken Salad (roasted chicken on a bed of mixed greens, cheeses and a delightful vinaigrette dressing).  They have a decent wine list, great selection of Swiss imported ails to try and a full bar.  Desert:  Chocolate Fondue ~ it was fun and entertaining with the kiddo!  It wasn't too hot and they provide a lot of strawberries, apples, pastry puffs and chocolate brownie wedges for you to dip into the chocolaty goodness!    Service:  Was FANTASTIC!  Our server was able to give us just enough suggestions based on our like/dislikes.  We had the Groupon deal so it made our meal was very inexpensive.  Everything was fresh and fantastic and most of their crepes are gluten free.  We can't wait to go back and try something different.

I feel like I'm cheating on In-and-Out whenever I eat at Five Guys. I'm going to be honest. I LOVE In-and-Out, the pride and joy of the west coast.  BUT Five guys is pretty darn good. I love that you can customize your burgers. Gooey cheese... grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers what ever pleases your taste buds.    The fries were excellent and even better than In-and-Out, especially when you add their Cajun seasoning. The prices were decent (though more expensive than In-and-Out after you include their fries and drink).  Is this the best fast food burger I've ever eaten? No, but it is pretty gosh darn good for fast food burgers. This is better than your average burger, so look out Culver's. I'm hungry now!

Had a wonderful lunch here this week with some good Yelp friends, Rand H. Robyn N. and Mike C.!  I was a little skeptical at first based on the very high Yelp rating's and knowing it's a buffet but the Wandering Horse Buffet exceeded all my expectations.  It's an awesome place to dine with friends and family both for lunch and dinner.  The decor is nice, somewhat modern contemporary-ish with both tables and booths to choose from for seating.  They have a large bar on the middle of the dinning area as you go into the buffet area.  Relaxing colors through the dinning room with one wall full of windows with a view of the mountains in the back ground.  They have a nice patio area for when the weather permits.   The service was good.  They were very attentive to our needs and kept our table clean.  The price of $12.99 was exceptional considering the ginormous smorgasbord of culinary delights they offer!  The food was scrumptious!  They had just about everything including the kitchen sink!!  I wanted to try everything but there was no way I could, it's that large of a buffet, but I tried....    The Asian area had duck cooked at least three ways and several other options.  The Mexican area offered several traditional favorites including chili rellenos, fajitas and the best shrimp/scallop ceviche.  The prime rib was fantastic but the pork lion was a little dry.  The Italian area had the most wonderful mushroom filled spinach ravioli's in a lite cream sauce!  The smoked salmon salad and curry and vegetarian wantons are things I'll dream about until my next visit.  They were delicious!   There were so many other options to choose from, there is no way I could list them all in this Yelp review.  I'm looking forward to going back to the Wandering Horse Buffet, so I hope to see you there!

Decided to drive a bit out of the my way to try Rocket Burger & Subs based on the "Yelper" reviews!!  This place is too clean for a "Greasy or a Dive" title, but there food reminds me of some of the BEST greasy/dives out there!    They have a wide variety of food choices and there menu doesn't tell the whole story, so you may need to ask some questions.  When I looked through their burgers I noticed the "Eddie Lopez".    To my surprise there is a better burger topping than bacon...  Hot Pastrami!!!  It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!!   We also had the "sub of the day" ~ the Big Dipper.  The roast beef was delicious and it had just the right amount of cheese.  Their au jus dipping sauce was not good, but the sandwich was superb.  Their Au jus did not have a beefy taste, it was too thin, too hot and did not set well on the pallet with this sandwich.  Their fries are fresh but a bit too greasy for our taste.  Will try to get them well done on our next visit or try their onion rings.  Their cheese curds were very good!  They do have one of the largest selections of soda, pop in a bottle.  It's fun to try a soda you've never heard about before like an imported micro brew root beer or cream soda!  (Both were very good BTW)  Rocket Burger & Subs, even though it will be extremely hard for me to consider ordering something other than the Eddie Lopez burger, I'm looking forward to my next visit, trying something else and plan to bring some friends with me. If you have not tried RB&S, they are a solid place to "Book Mark"!  Yelpers, what is your favorite Rocket Burger or Sub??

First off, this place is not easy to find...  But that made my trip to find some "porky on a poke" even more interesting and some what of an adventure.  I've been looking forward to eating at their Pork on a Fork dinner after sampling some of their delicious pulled pork at the Town and Country Market.   Thanks goodness for that little foldable road side sign stating "Pork on a Fork" ~~ this way...  I found them! You open the door and you're blasted with the awesome aroma of slow cooked pork, smoking in a wood burning oven/smoker.  "What a smell!"  The place is no frills, simple yet very accommodating for people wanting to dine their.  They are a take out or dine in.    They have a small selection of menu items for both breakfast and lunch, mostly pork products.  This is what makes this place unique and awesome!  They are able to focus their efforts on perfecting "porky on a poke" via pulled pork, bacon, ham, brats, polish dogs and beef brisket.  They do offer a variety of side items as well but "no salad for you" here.  Important factoid: They are not open for dinner ~ 7am-3pm only.  The service was excellent and ready to answer any questions you may have concerning their menu. I had their pulled pork sandwich which brought the biggest smile to my face after eating it.  In fact I think I'm still smiling and it's been a couple of days ago since I was there, lol! There portion of smoked pork-to-bun was definitely in favor of the smoked pork hands down.  It was a big sandwich and full of tasty, smoky, moist porky goodness which I topped with their Hot BBQ sauce. The side if waffle fries and beans were average at best.  We also had their Spicy Polish which was good but no comparison to their pork. We also had their potato salad and coleslaw which were again just ok.  This is a fantastic place for smoked pork sandwiches, ham and beef brisket!  I am looking forward to trying their bacon, BLT or their pork burrito on my next visit. If you're near 19th Ave and Deer Valley, head east about 4 blocks on Deer Valley until you see a little "Pork on a Fork" road side sign and turn in.  You won't be disappointed.

It's been almost a year since my last review and thought it was time to share an update with my fellow Yelpers :^)  ======Smoky Goodness Alert========  Be prepared to smell smoky goodness upon entry of Pork on a Fork!!  It is highly addictive in intoxicating, so dinners beware!    Pork on a Fork has the BEST PULLED PORK sandwich in Phoenix and maybe even the best in the entire Universe!!  Sure their might be a few other places that have better BBQ Ribs, Brisket and/or Smoked Sausages, but Pork on a Fork is as good or better than most at these and the are the BEST at Pulled Pork!    You can not beat their Pulled Pork Sandwich, which is HUMONGOUS~ almost enough for two people!  It's so moist, tender and with a nice aroma of smokiness you'll want it for for yourself! It comes with two sides.  I recommend their tasty seasoned waffle fries and their BBQ Beans!  These BBQ Beans are cooked in Heaven ~ sent by angels down to earth and given to Pork on a Fork to sell to their customers!  :^)  Well, maybe that's a stretch but their BBQ Beans are soooo tasty full of bacon and brisket burnt ends with a great balance of seasoning.   If you have tried Pork on the Fork yet, you don't know what you're missing.  Once you've tried them for lunch, you'll find yourself wanting more and caan't wait for your next visit!  I hope to see you there.

There has been plenty said already about this crazy hot dog wagon ~ Short Leashed Dogs, and most of it true!  Their hot dog creations are  creative, tasty and just freaking awesome!  Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.  Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.    I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalapeños, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.  They have bottled H2O and soda in bottles. I found the diet black cherry goes well with any hot dog. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations around town.  Look them up on FB, find them and enjoy a creative and delicious bite to eat.

My wife and I miss eating good BBQ while in Memphis and have not been able to find good/quality BBQ since we moved here a couple of years ago... Well we finally have found a place that's almost as good as it gets, even if they were in Memphis TN, Q to U BBQ.    Q to U BBQ is a great new restaurant in Anthem, YEA!!  They are locally owned and operated by a wonderful family that competes nationally in BBQ contest. They are by far the best BBQ we've tasted in the Phoenix market. Their BBQ sauce is a good combination of sweet and spice and they use their own dry rub. It's good!    They offer pork, brisket, chicken and of course ribs. They have salads (for you light weights) and a good variety of sides, appetizers and deserts. They offer dine in, carry out and catering too. The only thing missing from their menu is fried pickles, bread roles with honey butter and sweet tea.   We recommend Q to U BBQ to all of our friends and hope you give them a chance next time your craving for awesome BBQ!

I'm still a huge fan of Q to U but the pulled pork was dry and needed the extra BBQ sauce on my last visit.  They only have one sauce and a dry rub seasoning but that's not an issue since their sauce is better than most and is finger lick~n, lip smack~n good without question!    We also had their ribs which were still a 5 star rating and we had their Hawg Dog ~ smoked sausage link stuffed with cheese and wrapped in bacon!!  It was topped with an onion and jalapeño relish that was Hawg Heavenly!  The fries were very good with some of the dry BBQ seasoning but their potato salad was not as fresh as with prior visits and their slaw tasted a lot like KFC.    All in all, I'm still a HUGE fan of Q to U and think they are the best place to go for BBQ ribs, BBQ chicken and now Hawg Dogs in the Phoenix market.

Q to U is a total 5 star experience when it comes to dinning BBQ in the Phoenix area!  It's been since Feb since my last update.  Owners David and Karyn continue to make tweets and adjustments to their restaurant to ensure they are providing their customers a great dinning experience and THE BEST BBQ in and around the Phoenix metro.    Start your meal off with an app of Pulled Pork BBQ Nachos and some tasty Arizona beer and/or ails!!! They have BBQ Brew, Domestic and Premium Beers available.    The best thing to order for two really hungry people or for a small family is their Loosen your Belt~ 1/2 slab of their award winning ribs, smoked chicken thigh/leg, large portion of their award winning pulled pork and brisket.  You also have your choice of two pint sized sides.  I recommend their seasoned fried and potato salad or their BBQ beans!!  This is a whole lot of their BBQ deliciousness for $25.    Q to U is a fantastic place to bring your family next time you're searching for some really good BBQ or just plain hungry and enjoy tasty, almost sinfully~deliciousness food.    So if you're in the area, stop by and let David, Karyn and the Q to U team take care of you're BBQ craving!

This place is addictive, so planning and extra 10 minutes in the gym everyday for the rest of your life will be required should you decide to eat here :-)   My first experience; a business lunch was catered in at the college and we had the most amazing grilled chicken strips with several different types of dips, some grilled veggies and these little tins filled with the most creamy, cheesy Mac-n-cheese like mom used to make.  It was an excellent lunch, made us feel like kiddos again during a long day of meetings.    2nd experience;  a month later we requested the same caterer however they were über busy and could not deliver so we decided we would go to them.  They are located about 30 minutes away, but they were that good and worth it.  This time a order the fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream and honey mustard sauces with grilled veggies.  It again was DELISH!  So much, my colleague order some extra to take with him on the plane.    3rd experience; oh heck, I've been back more times now then I would admit to :-) yes they are that good!    Order their fried chicken strips with the wasabi cream sauce and the Mac-n-cheese then plan to spend an extra 10-20 minutes in the gym!!!  I'm looking forward to going back the next time I'm in Vegas.  I hope to see you there.

Elevate is one of the best coffee places in North Phoenix.  It's tucked in away in the Norterra Shops next to the Harkins Theater.    I'm not a coffee expert but I think a good espresso requires the right ingredients, good equipment, and people who know what they are doing with both.  I'm SO glad I came across this place. It has a great atmosphere ~ great seating everywhere both inside and out, uplifting interior designs, cool tunes give a good vibe, and awesome baristas make delicious intelligentsia coffee.  They use Arabic beans from the world's premier growing regions and equipment that seems fancy enough.  Best of all~ they are giving 10 cents per cup of coffee they sell goes to provide clean water for a child in Africa!  They have very friendly and knowledgeable staff that doesn't completely change by the day.  They consistently produce perfect tasting drinks far beyond the quality you will find the large coffee chains in the neighborhood.  They also offer a variety of pastries, deserts, sandwiches and soups.  They offer live entertainment on certain nights and weekends.  It's a great place to rest, relax, build relationships with your friends!

Awesome coffee/tea and good eats too!  What's not to love about this place?    They roast their coffee in-house, offering a wonderful selection of coffee from different regions.  They have light/dark roast.    Good eats - try one of their savory or desert crepes!  They are delish!   I hope to see you there the next time your in the Norterra Shopping plaza.

We've been to Wolfey's a couple of different times now and our experiences have been the same ~ Meh.  I was hoping for a better experience based on the owner is local and they are conveniently located but this was not the case.   Good ~ location, location, location!!  In an area where there are some many things going on and options to choose from it is in a good location.  They have a very good selection of beers/ales on tap.  It's also family friendly.  Not so good ~ Staff is not very attentive nor helpful.  We ordered their pizza special ~ 241 and asked for some cheese and peppers.  Server stated, "we only have four shakers in the entire restaurant so I don't know why we keep offering these pizza specials"...  She was actually implying they change their business model based on the number of cheese shakers??  We actually got better service when we helped ourselves.  The food ~ as stated by other Yelpers, some of their food taste like it's been pre-frozen, thawed and then reheated.  We had the worst pizza's and based on the left overs on other tables we were not alone with this assessment.  Burger and fries ~ not fresh and over cooked.  Their wings are not any better.  The skin/crust is falling off before you get a chance to eat it.  They were drowned in a honey BBQ sauce, which just made these wings a gooey mess.  Not planning on being a regular here.

Expect terrible service from the time you check in until you check out.  The reason for 2 stars and not one - my room was clean when I finally got in it and the bed was comfy.    When I stay at a Hampton Inn I don't expect much but what I do expect is consistency.  Hampton Inn and Hilton properties are usually very consistent with great serviceand clean and comfortable rooms.   You almost always get a friendly greeting when you arrive some warm cookies and in some Hampton Inns you might even get a beer or glass of wine.   NOT HERE -no friendly greeting when you arrive -check in is very slow compared to all other Hampton Inns -supervisor was aware of issue and did nothing -cleaning service runs late.  I had to wait on the cleaning person to finish my room at 4:30pm  -the front desk person was not empathetic to me having to wait in the lobby for the cleaning person to finish -manger was aware of issue and did nothing  -no cookies?  But wait, there are doggie snacks.... -had to ask if my room was ready and then wait some more  -front desk person yells "have a good evening" -room key doesn't work -no apology nor empathy from the front desk person nor manager -get into room and the air was not on so its hot  -packing bags now to find a better hotel -getting ready to leave and give the manager one last chance to save me as a guest  No Bueno

Finally an official "go to" diner for breakfast in Phoenix, without all of the added hype wait times and over~inflated~self~indulging hoopla that some of the "more famous" breakfast places have had from being featured on TV's food network!  Joe's Diner is the real deal, cooking tasty homemade breakfast the way it should be.  First thing I noticed is this place is ten times the size of the other two "more famous" breakfast diners with plenty of room to move around with little wait times even when they are busy. It's easy in and easy out!   Second thing I noticed was the service. It was fantastic and memorable! In fact it was THE BEST service we've experienced in any diner throughout all of Phoenix.  Even Joe gets involved cleaning tables, meeting his customers, shaking hands and asking for feedback on what he can do better to make your dining experience even better.  Dolores G mention he brought out some black eyed peas during her visit for good luck in the New Year. During our visit Joe brought out some samples of his candied toffee that was not on the menu for us to sample. It was toffee deliciousness that I've never experienced before. This owner is FANTASTIC with his customers!  The third and final thing I noticed was their food tasted exceptional. Everything was cooked and seasoned very well. We ordered almost a sample of everything from pancakes with eggs, bacon and has browns to corn beef hash with eggs on top with a side of biscuits and gravy. We also had their Sunday special of eggs Benedict with a side of sausage.  Everything was awesome. Their homemade pancakes were light and had just enough flavor without being too doughy. Their scratch biscuits and gravy were "the bomb"! You can eat just the biscuit by it's self, it has that much flavor. Their sausage was exceptional with the right amount of spices and fat ratio. Their coffee was very smooth and tasty. They use Arbuckles, made in Tucson. We bought a bag to bring home!  My only criticism was even though their corn beef hash and bacon tasted very good they weren't homemade at their diner, for everything else was.  Joe thanked me for my feedback and stated he has been working on making these in house with some trial and error. This is why this place deserves a 5 star rating, hand down.   Joe and his staff will make your visit enjoyable, appetite fulfilling and well worth your time and money. I've been to the other two so called "more famous" breakfast diners many times and I have never met theirs owners nor have received service even close to this.   Look out Phoenix and those two so called "more famous" diners!!  Joe's Diner will win you over as they have with me.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to try something Joe has either on or off his menu!

The Persimmon Dining Room is located in the Anthem Country Club. Their Patio offers a classic ambiance with spectacular views of the 18th fairway and is a perfect setting for watching Arizona's beautiful desert Sunsets. The menu provides variety, a contemporary flair and memorable Sophistication, and the wine list and liquor selections appeal to a wide variety of tastes. All of the services and facilities at this Clubhouse are designed with the goal and spirit of providing it's Members and their guest with the enjoyment of an inviting yet unpretentious setting.

Wow, I found a Starbucks that hasn't been reviewed yet, and I bet that loads of Yelp-er peeps have been here.  Coffee at Starbucks is Coffee at Starbucks; the flavor doesn't change much...  This Starbucks location gets a "fan" rating not because of the coffee, but the fantabulous service! This Starbucks is a well oiled machine when you need a cup of Joe and your in a rush.  In the many times I've ordered here, it seems they have a good system in place to deal with the heavy traffic that happens sporadically throughout the day.  Don't be deceived by the long lines at this location.  The baristas that run this Starbucks know how to handle the fluctuations in traffic.  On top of the speedy service, the baristas here are also very friendly and pleasant. They're nice without being too sugary, if you know what I mean.  I would not recommend going here if you plan on staying a while to study. Finding an empty table is very hit and miss and there's just a lot of traffic. It can get distracting.  Overall, a great experience. Props to this Starbucks for knowing how to serve coffee efficiently with friendly faces!

I'm a bit of a germ-a-fob so you wont usually find me at buffets very often but I had to try this place after our waitress (while dinning at a fine dinning sea food restaurant) recommended we try Pacific Seafood Buffet.  She was the BEST waitress we've had in a super long time and extremely honest with us when we asked her where she eats seafood and she said, "Pacific ~ but please don't tell anyone"..    If you're looking for a great Asian style seafood buffet, this place is it! It's not Rio's Seafood Buffet in Las Vegas, but give this place a shot and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, variety and freshness this place has to offer especially in Phoenix AZ!  I actually like this buffet better than the Rio.  It's got as good of a selection of food and it's half the price.  Albeit the decor isn't as nice, but I would trade a nicely decorated place for better food any day. The quality of the food is slightly better at the Rio, however it's not twice the price better, and we don't have to go all the way to Las Vegas to eat at a great seafood buffet ~ it's in our own back yard!  This place has got you covered with a little bit of Chinese, Thai, Korean, Mongolian BBQ, dim sum, and a generous and decent sashimi/sushi bar. For dinner and lunch you'll find a huge selection of freshly cooked food to choose from like snow crab, sea bass, mussels, oysters, many different kinds of shrimp, Peking duck, escargot and so much more.  Since this place is still fairly new, you don't have to wait in the long lines. The servers are quite attentive, they will take plates almost as soon as you are done with it and I never quite saw the bottom of my glass.  This is a great place to go when we are thinking about eating seafood, sushi and/or Chinese.   I'd technically rather give this place a 4.5 stars, but this place deserves better than a 4, so I'm going with a 5 star.

Was going to "North" for lunch today in Glendale to my surprise it's now Ninf'a's Mexican Kitchen...  It changed from a Fox restaurant to a Legacy owned restaurant.    We were game for a new experience, so we tried this Houston based tex-mex restaurant.  I was hit with the smell of fresh tortillas when we walked in the door. They redecorated the place and it's very inviting, nicely decorated with very comfy booths and a warm atmosphere.  They have a full bar with limited wine selections, beer on tap and bottles, sangria and fantastic margarita's.     We were seated and treated to some of the nicest service I've experienced in a good while. Our server was amazing and delightful.  She very attentive to our drinks and took just enough time to explain their menu and specialties. Some servers can be "over the top" especially when a place is new, but she was extremely pleasant.   We started with queso. Fresh chunks of green onion, tomato and cilantro leaves made the queso an instant hit with me. Nothing worse than getting bad queso, but no worries here--theirs is a class act. The house chips and salsa's are also really good and served right away as we sat down.   I was going to try their homemade Horchata but ordered a melon agua fresca with my food instead.  It's a short but sweet affair, as it comes out in a cocktail glass. If you're looking for the giant tub you usually get when ordering one of these guys--not here. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just nod. The melon, however, was fresh, sweet and delightful.   I'll have fajitas once in a while, but it's not something I get excited about at a restaurant because they generally taste the same everywhere I've had them. At Ninfa's however it was "excellente" when it comes to fajita's. The sizzling plate came out and my eyes widened at the wonderful smell and beautiful the strips of meat.  Things we tried and were also very tasty: carne asada, chicken enchiladas, shrimp chiveche salad and chicken and avocado salad, yum!   Sadly, I had to hit the road and keep working but at least my appetite was content. I'll definitely be back and looking forward to giving them a 5th star. I think my only dilemma will be ordering something other than the fajitas next time....

The Java Worx is a locally owned coffee cafe that is a great alternative to the chain coffee places that are in Anthem! Not that I'm calling them out but you know who they are, their name starts with a star and ends with a bucks...  The Java Worx offers an excellent organic roasted coffee that is exceptional smooth from the front to the back of the mouth.  I had the "Java Pressed" coffee this morning that is coffee ground to an espresso consistency then steeped for ten seconds and then pressed through an air press. It was delicious! They also offer latte's and espresso's of course.    They have a selection of pastries, cakes and cookies that come from a Brooklyn market including a yummy black & white cookie!  They also offer a few bagels and sandwich wraps if your dining for lunch.    They have some comfy couches and chairs for reading and different sizes of tables and chairs for meeting with people or surfing the web on your I-Pad or lap top.  It's a very comfortable place and easy to loose track of time while talking and/or debating about the local news with some neighbors and friends.  This is a great place to visit and have a wonderful tasting cup of joe!  Hope to see you there!

~~~~~~CLOSED~~~~~~  It's so sad but true, Java Worx closed.  Another fantastic local business bite the dust.  What in the world will Anthem residents do for their caffeine fix?  Where will they get a tasty cup of coffee or delicious pastries/cookies/food and don't forget the wonderful latte's, hot and cold tea's?    Is this a sign that the world is coming to end very soon???  Oh the horror and madness of it all!

We went to Tacos Atoyac for lunch again and really enjoyed the food based on a recommendation from Iain B.  This is not border Mexican food but rather oaxaca or oaxaquena southern Mexico or what you might find in Mexico City.  Their prices are very easy on your pockets, but don't let that fool you.  Their food is extremely fresh, unique and delicious.  What a little "gem" of a place this is!    Restaurant ~ Tacos Atoyac is small and not very appealing on the outside (somewhat of a dive look) but it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  This place is very clean with a simple design on the inside. The folks that work here are friendly and will make you feel very welcomed.  This was huge since for us since both of us speak very little Spanish.    Food ~ You order your food when you walk in and they bring you your delicious oaxacan-Mexican food to you accompanied with a side of cooked jalapenos, onions and salsa (you can choose green, red or a guacamole infused salsa).  The green chili salsa went exceptionally well with my fish and al pastor tacos.  No chips and salsa here, which I'm perfectly fine with.    On our first visit we sampled all of the tacos at $1 each.  The carne asada and al pastor were tender and delicious with with some chopped cilantro and onions on top. All of the tacos were very good, even the lengua and tripa o cabeza tacos. (yes I knew they were tongue and tripe~ but they were good!) I just added a little salsa which gave it just the right amount of heat to add to the flavor.  We also tried their spicy beef and chicken tamales at $1.75. Thy were very good as well but I preferred their tacos, so went back for few more.  Total bill with a few drinks was around $18 for us both.  Second visit we had their fish tacos ~ they are delish!  We also had a couple of quesadilla's since they were making them fresh from scratch at $1.50. The corn quesadilla was tasty with some fresh green  epazote, cheese and a light spread of frijoles! We also tried their flour quesdilla's and a few burros with al pastor and carne asada.  They too were very good with a nice balance of fresh guacamole and loads of meat in their burros. We sampled a lot of food again this trip and left stuffed and happy with a bill of only $24.    We have really enjoyed most of the things we've tried so far and we are looking forward to coming back very soon.  Tacos Atoyac will leave you satisfied, happy and planning what to eat on your next visit.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor.  I hope to see you there.

Searching Yelp for a locally owned place to eat lunch in this area and the Asian Island popped up.  Hawaiian and Chinese cuisine with sushi, prepared and served restaurant style but in a place that looks somewhat like a new dinner/fast food-ish.    I had their Kung Pao Two ~ with chicken and shrimp.  The portion was large and it was delish!  The fried rice was a little dry, but still tasty.  My friend had the Hawaiian Seafood Mix with fried shrimp and BBQ short ribs with a side of rice.  He really enjoyed his meal.  The Hawaiian BBQ short ribs were his fave ~ he gnawed on the bones!    The service is very friendly and eager to please.  If you're in the area looking for a great lunch, the Asian Island is a solid place to go.

Firehouse Subs is one of the best sub places around, in my humble opinion. We miss them from when we lived in South Florida. We found this Firehouse Subs just as good and consistent as back in Florida.  First of all, their meatball subs are like a work of art. It's not often that I have seen such a beautiful, mouth-watering meatball sandwich - I'm not exaggerating about that either.   I came back to Firehouse Subs and got another one the other day and it was like reuniting with that one girl; you know, that one from college you never told your parents about... aww yeah, what memories.  Their other sandwiches, while not being as visually stunning as the meatball, have their appealing idiosyncrasies. Sort of like that other girls from college - all kinds of varieties with their own appeal in one way or another.  Some were "fiery hot" while other were more sophisticated and refined.    This is a great place for a sub sandwich!  They food is very tasty, service is fast and friendly and they are conveniently located just south of the 101Hwy on 67th Ave.  I hope to see you there.

We would not have known about this place were it not for the Yelp deal!  Agave Blue Frozen Yogurt was a good find thanks to Yelp.  Im not familiar with this area and we were on a quest for some frozen yogurt!  We found a place that served frozen custard and although it was very temping it would have been way too heavy for us.    We searched the Yelp deals and found the Agave Blue Frozen Yogurt!  They were offering a $10 deal for $5.  There was three of us, which $10 was more than enough for all of us to have a heaping bowl of tasty yogurt!  They had fewer selections to choose from than what we've found at other places but what they do offer is delish! They have several toppings to choose from including fresh fruit which is our favorite topping.  Nothing's beats fresh berries on top of frozen yogurt! !    So pull up their Yelp deal and treat yourself and some friends to a cheap anf tasty treat, to beat the heat, now that was neat B-)

Stop by with the family to grab some tasty burgers and tots and we were surprisingly somewhat disappointed.  It's been over a year since we've eaten here last and I thought it would be the same or even better but we found ourselves leaving, thinking we should have stopped by the Islands restaurant or In-N-Out maybe.    I had their special, Batter Up for $9.50.  Not sure why this thing cost some much.  It had two patties (it needs two patties since they are uber small) a couple of small slices of kielbasa topped with BBQ potatoes chips.  It was okay, nothing I would ever order again.  My son had their Paradise cheese burger.  It was much better than mine for $3 less however my son did not like the cucumbers on the burger nor did I.  Wifey had their tacos which she really enjoyed.  We ordered H2O to drink however it was cucumber infused water that tasted like it needed a refresher or something, very stale.  The sweet tater tots were okay, but they were a bit mushy.    If you like cucumbers, this is totally the place for you!   (Side note to the owner/manager your music was a little loud.  We were struggling to hear our convo.   You also need to wash off your front side walk and tables to make a better impression with your customers).

Yogurt Garden is fairly new in Anthem and very welcomed as a great place to go for the family and friends for some frozen yogurt.  They offer different selections of frozen yogur-tee goodness including some sugar free or no sugar added selections with both fresh and confectionery toppings at $0.39 per ounce.    The flavor selection here is good and somewhat unique.  I think they offer about 10 flavors a day with some unique flavors that they rotate.  You have your choice of filling a bowl or waffle cone.  Select your yogurt choice then go over to the fresh fruit and candy store for toppings.  Yogurt Garden did a nice job of making toppings and "penny candy" seem fun again.  Plus, they had a nice selection of fruit, which can drastically alter the flavor of a yogurt selection.     So the next time your in this area and craving a tasty treat, stop by the Yogurt Garden in Anthem in front of the Fry's shopping center on Daisy Mountain.  Great yogur-tee goodness is waiting for you to give them a try.  I hope to see you there!

I met some friends, Robyn N. and Rand H., here today to try their lunch buffet which is served during the week and on Sundays I believe.  It was a slow start to our culinary dinning experience at Pete's Thai Cuisine which started off as a 2 star experience waiting for them to open late and their kitchen was behind in getting everything out.  They slowly gained momentum as they brought out more food and our experience went from 2 stars to almost 5 stars!   Restaurant~ please don't judge this place by the curb side appeal!  It's dinner dive that's connected to a auto shop on the southwest corner of Thunderbird and Cave Creek.  The inside is nicely decorated, very clean and inviting.  They have chosen a nice pallet of colors for the walls and they even have stenciled painting on the floors.  (glitter alert for those glitter fobes out there!) just kidding :^)  It's a nice experience inside this place.  Service~ very limited staff which is expected in a small dinner like this, but they are very friendly.    Food~ the soup was one of the items late to get out of the kitchen, but it was worth the wait! We had Coconut Soup with Chicken, coconut milk with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.  It was fantastic! Their Pad Thai was pretty good and seemed to be one of the favorites from other dinning at the same time as us.  It was put out and gone quickly!    Their Stir-Fried Big Fresh Rice Noodle with Chicken & Egg was something I've not had before.  They had both Red and Green curry dishes with  coconut milk, bamboo shoots, green beans, Thai eggplant,  Thai herbs with chicken and/or tofu. They also had Spicy Muscles and Spicy Squid dishes as well.  Most everything tasted 4-5 stars!  Recommendation~ go later than 11:30am, say 12-12:30pm to give them time to get everything out.  They are very good and very inexpensive at less than $8/person, so bring some friends and have a very good and filling Thai lunch!  I hope to see you there.

What a great new "gem" to find in Vegas for non-locals!  The Barrymore is "old classic dinning" meets modern "Americano" style.  This place reminds me of an extremely nice cigar lounge minus the smoke and odors that has been renovated by a modern designer  =)  The lounge area is very nice area to start off your adventure with a glass of wine or cocktail. They have very comfy seats away from the bar that can be very cozy for two or opened up for small groups.   They have a great sleection of wines and house specialty drinks.   The dinning areas are also very nice!  Try to get a booth if you can, it's the best seat in the house. The food is as equally impressive as the decor. They have an award winning chef at the helm and he is excellent!  We choose to eat in the lounge since it was lunch and had a burger with fries.  The burger is grass fed beef cooked to perfection and the fries were more like frites with herbs and salt. It was delish!  We also had a chicken Cesar salad that was also very good.   This is a great place for either drinks in the lounge or for dinning. They are open for for breakfast, lunch and dinner so give them a try if you're in the area.

Coyotes Oaties is another little "hidden gem" located in downtown Glendale.  They have some of the most amazing cookies and a wonderful selection of custom herbal teas and coffee.   They take a lot of pride in their never compromising integrity with the quality of the cookies and food they sell.  Their customer service is FANTASTIC, very personable, friendly and eager to please their customers.  Food~ everything is made with whole rolled oats, real cream butter, no white sugar or flour, 0 trans fat and no preservatives.  So do the cookies taste good with no trans fat?  YES!  They are DELISH!    Service/shop~ They are wonderful!  The shop makes you feel like you're in someone's indoor garden with plenty of seating and some tables to enjoy their cookies, coffee and teas.   They will ship almost everything so they are a great choice for sending gifts!  They will personalize orders with a special touch.    I'm looking forward to my next gluten free, white chocolate with macadamia nut cookies and some lemon soufflés hot tea.   I hope to see you there!

I'm so ~ oh so glad to see Pita Jungle open at the Norterra shopping center at the I17 Hwy and Happy Valley!!!  This shopping center desperately needed another great place to dine and drink with friends and family!!    They have the same menu ~ serving fresh and great tasting ingredients with a Mediterranean flair.  This Pita Jungle is very new but they have seemed to work out most of the kinks that come with opening a new restaurant.  Their food is DELISH and they give fantastic service, despite what the angry Desiree says, lol!   You can't go wrong in ordering their roasted pepper or the infamous  Cilantro Jalapeno Hummus.  Heck order the trio and try all three as an app!    I like their Mediterranean Chicken and their Carribean salads.  Both are very tasty and wont way you down afterwards for additional drinks or desert.   Their pita's are also very good.  I prefer their  Mediterranean roasted  Chicken shawarma ~ yum-fest! We also order some of their pizza's that are cooked in their wood fired oven.  Go for either their glazed Chicken Lavosh pizza or their roasted Garlic and Portobello pizza, both are full of flavor.  The best thing about this Pita Jungle....well besides their~  -the most awesome location (you can do dinner and a movie at Norterra)  -the young and uber friendly and accommodating staff  -the fresh with healthy options and delicious food   is their Happy Hours from 3pm to 6pm and then again at 9pm till close!!!  $2 beer and wine, $3 mix drinks and they offer a selection of $2 and $3 tapas apps!!!  I hope to see you there on my next visit!

Unfortunately Fu Fu Cuisine was more So So Cusinse for me...  I so wanted to give this small business owner a higher rating especially after reading several friends reviews.  Well, my experience was somewhat disappointing when I fellow Yelpers Rand H. and Mike C. this week for lunch.    Restaurant ~ very clean and inviting.  Nothing fancy, very basic dinner type of feel.  They had the music way too loud for me while trying to enjoy lunch with some friends.    Service ~ very nice and friendly however they were not very attentive to our drinks.  I also had an issue where they over charged me for an added soup.  One person's soup was $2.99 and my soup was $4.99?  I would have been OK with this if my portion was larger than the other but they were the same size.  After pointing it out the server lowered the price.    Food ~ everything was just so so.  The dumpling soup was more broth than anything else.  Two small dumplings and three small pieces of cubed goat meat and a 1/4 ear of corn...  I do not recommend this soup.  The jerk chicken and rice was very dry and lacked the grilled flavor that usually comes with Caribbean jerk chicken.  The Pof Pof balls were too big and doughy and were more like really big flour hush puppies.  The meat pie was the star of my dinning experience here!  I don't my experience is a "one off" because the Yelpers that joined me experienced the same so so cuisine I had.

Ric's "where's the smoke" Smokehouse BBQ & Grill needs to rethink their restaurant strategy quickly or they will find themselves closing faster than what it took them to open....  I reeeaaalllyyyy wanted to like this place!  I'm a huge fan of BBQ and a fan of small business owners.  They are somewhat handicapped with a location that has gobbled up prior restaurants that closed almost as fast as they opened, never to be heard from again....  But it was their choice to open a Restaurant in this spot.  "Where's the smoke"?  One of the first things you will notice about Ric's Smokehouse when you enter is there isn't any wonderful aromas of cooked BBQ, smoked or otherwise.  There is no BBQ aroma, What the heck?  You should always smell some kind of aromatic BBQ goodness when you enter a BBQ, especially when the word "smoke" is in their name!  After a completely disastrous first visit with horrible food and poor service I held back on writing my Yelp review to give this new business an opportunity to work through the kinks. I shared my concerns about their food with the people at Ric's in hopes they would consider making some changes that would help them.    Now that I have been back twice since my first visit and the issues I pointed out during my first visit still exist.  I don't feel so bad at all in letting my Yelp friends know that Eek! Methinks not! when it comes to choosing Ric's Smokehouse BBQ & Grill as a BBQ place to eat at.  Food ~ they offer four to five different selections of BBQ sauce, which two of them are really good.  Pork sandwich comes with one side at $7.99 when other BBQ places give you two sides for the same price.  The pork on all three visits was over cooked with no smoke rings.  When pork is over cooked the ends of the pork become very dry, hard and chewy.  It taste a little like pork jerky.  Now they keep their pork in an au jus but it still over cooked and the au jus just soaks into the bun and does not keep the pork moist.  The bun they use is very tasty and they toast it.  The sides ~ not so good...  The brisket was pretty good however they sever it with the fat still on it.  Some fat might be ok but when the fat is 1/4 of the portion of meat your getting it's not so good.  Again it too is missing the aroma of BBQ  and a smoke ring.  The first potato salad was disgusting since they used frozen potatoes, however during my last visit the potato salad wasn't much better.  The mac-y-cheese and baked beans were huge flops with little to no flavor.  Most of their food is supposed to come with either a cheese biscuit or cornbread.  They keep forgetting to give that to their customers and when you ask for it, they give it to you cold, blah...  I'm not going to elaborate on the service since this review is already way too long.  This owner needs to rethink their business strategy and get some culinary help and advise quickly!  Buy a smoker maybe?    Their are other BBQ options in and around the Phoenix metro ~ all of them are much better than this place unfortunately.

Stopped by the Kentucky based BoomBozz Pizza & Taphouse for some lunch and had the pleasure of dinning with some fellow Yelpers; Rand H., Violeta H., Robyn N. & the famous "Orange Head ~ Mike C.!!  This is the first BoomBozz in AZ, which started in Louisville Kentucky, which peaked my interest.  This is NOT you average pizza place!  They offer a "serve-at-your-table-all-you-can-eat-pizza-special" for lunch!! Oh yeah! This is a HUGE plus for those germ-a-phoebes that refuse to eat at buffets.  No worries about someone else's grubby little hands touching the pizza pie prior to you getting a slice!  We had a very nice salad and some cheesy pizza to start off.  You have a choice of a mixed green or cesar salad I believe.   You can choose from a variety of pizza's or create your own!  Since we had a large group, we ordered a different kinds;  Greco, Quattro, All Meat, BBQ Chicken, Tony;s Supremo, Tuscan Chicken ~ which was a fave!    The service was very attentive and friendly.  The restaurant is very clean and has a kind of TGIF feel about it, but with better food.  This is a great place to meet some friends and fellow Yelpers over lunch! We had a wonderful time sharing each other pizzas and critiquing what we liked and disliked about each pie.  That's what Yelpers do best!! Hope to see you there sometime!

FINALLY a decent place for breakfast and lunch in this area!!!  Whoopee!    This Hot Bagels & Deli is very similar to the HB&D at 59th and the 101Hwy and the one up at Carefree and I17Hwy.  Same great menu and the same set up.  The only bad thing about this location is they are in the most hidden area of the Walmart Neighborhood Market strip center so unless you see their sign or search for them on Yelp, you may bot notice them.  Service~ they are new, still ironing out some kinks but all in all it was good service.   Food~ Some of the best bagels you'll find in and around Phoenix metro. We had an issue with their pumpernickel bagels missing some of the "pumper" in the nickel (meaning it was too light and did not have that solid~dark brown pumpernickel taste).  It was very good though especially with a fried egg and sausage!  Their lox and slice nova is very good and so is their coffee.  They use a Kona blend that taste more like Kona than most other blends.  They use only Boars Head products and they make their bagels fresh onsite.  I look forward to seeing this new small business grow and become as popular as the other HB&D's I mentioned.  I am SO GLAD to see them open in this area that is struggling with a decent place to eat breakfast!!  I hope to see you there.

This has become one of our new favorite breakfast places in Phoenix, The Vovomeena! They have unique food combinations that are delicious, a very comfortable dinning experience and their name is fun to say ~ Vovomeena.  Say it with me; "Vovomeena" :-)  zee food ~ My fave is the Mexican Benedict or the BMOC.  They both are excellent choices!  The Mexican Benedict has great favor and textures with poached eggs a top of the english muffins with some chorizo and a great hollandaise.  The BMOC is pockchop/waffle/eggies and a portuguese donut (not made by a portugese person nor flown in from Portugal because I asked..) is a flavor-fest!   My son loves the Pain Perdu which is banana bread pudding french toast with the most amazing whiskey caramel sauce and a side of bacon or sausage.  I like it as well! The coffee is great and they provide you with a to-go cup when you're ready.    zee place to eat ~ it's nicely decorated with plenty of seating despite this place is so small.  They have a few larger tables, which provide you an opportunity to dine with others you may or may not know :-)  The staff is very friendly and they are always ready to help you find their morning moonshine.    It's a great little place for breakfast.  I hope to see you there some day soon!  I'll save you a spot at the end of the big table :-)

I had a great experience at this Post Office earlier this week and thought, "I need to Yelp about them!"    I would have given them a 5 stars, but its a Post Office...  Yes they are slow, they don't have enough staff and everyone's trying to get their Christmas Cards sent all at the same time.  But despite these issues, the people that work at this Post Office rock!!  The very nice lady that helped me suggested a different way for me to ship my package that was more secure and it saved me some Cha - Ching $$Cash-o-la$$!!   This is a solid go to place if you're needing to ship something you just purchased at the Anthem outlets or if you live in the area!

Woe! Woe, wait just a minute!  Hold onto your hats cowboys/girls, this Portillo's is the real deal!  It's worthiness is much greater than some of the 3 star reviews I'm reading on the Yelp iPad-acus.  I've been here now 3 times (Yes, I missed a checkin for you fact seeking yelp nerds) and this is the Portillo's I've grown to love when traveling to Chicago many time over the years.    This Portillo's reminds me of the one in Dekalb IL.  The decor, shape and  size are very similar.  The food taste just as good as well!  The only thing different are the droves of people trying to go here for a bite to eat all at the same time!!  But don't let that stop you from giving this Portillo's a try!  It's a fantastic place to go for a delicious hot Italian roast beef sandwich dry, dipped or wet!  Their hotdogs are great and so are their salads (believe it or not :-)    If your feeling adventurous and hungry, I must warn you this can NOT be good for your health but it is really tasty good, try their Italian roast beef and grilled sausage with peppers!  OH MY!  It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload...   The only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food.   In looking forward to going back again real soon.  I hope to see you their!

YES YOU'RE SMART PHONE IS NOT BROKEN, THERE IS A SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET IN THE NORTH WEST VALLEY!!    This Sprouts Farmers Market is fantastic and has quickly become our favorite Sprouts in the Valley.   What a great place to shop for fresh/organic foods, herbs, vitamins and produce and meats!     Although they are very new, they've hired a super duper team of employees that will make you think they've been open for a long time.  They have been able to maintain a high level of service and they've kept their aisles full despite the hordes of people that are shopping here :-)  A few cool things you may not know about Sprouts; ~They sell AJ'S quality food at a much cheaper price.  Especially what's in their weekly ad!   ~They give you an incentive to bring you own bags ~The best day to shop is on Wednesday so you can take advance to both weeks sales.    ~Save some money and eat healthier by shopping their fresh grains from bulk.   ~one the best gluten free shopping experience you'll have in the valley.   ~Order lunch while you shop.  $2.99 the deli will make you a fresh deli/veggie sandwich to order.    You're going to love shopping at this Sprouts!  Looking forward to seeing you there soon.

I came to Little Miss BBQ based on a recommendation from another BBQ restaurant owner.  He was telling me about how this BBQ Team beat him and several other regional competition BBQ Teams in a recent contest.  He said they had cooked some of the best brisket he's had in a long time.    Well, he's right.  They have excellent BBQ brisket!  It doesn't last long after they open, so you'll need to get their early.  I did try everything else and found it all to be very good.  Their pulled pork was average compared to some other BBQ places around Phoenix, but their ribs, smoked sausage and their brisket were awesome.  I like their jalapeño grits a lot and their potato salad as well.    They are located in this very little place however they do have some seating set up outside.  With the cooler weather of winter in Phoenix, dinning outside is very nice!  Writing this review is making me hungry for some Little Miss BBQ!  I'm most certainly looking forward to my next visit and I hope to see you there!

Santos Lucha Libre is estupendo!!  This is another little gem hidden in the central northern Phoenix area.  It's not far from another little gem, Los Reyes De La Torta.  Santos Lucha Libre is a very unique dinning experience with delicious food and friendly service.    First impression ~ "Nacho Libre" mixed with Chipotle, but I was wrong on both counts!  This place is decorated with loads or lucha libre mask, costumes and really neat artwork on the walls.  It's an "eye - spy" fantasy room that is done very well and yet entertaining.    Their food is served similar to how they do things at the Chipotle but they offer a much larger selection and it taste much better.  They offer asada, pastor, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas and a few other proteins you can have assembled into street tacos, burrito and on a salad.  I had the 5 street tacos with a asada, pollo, carnitas, pastor and barbacoa, some spicy and some normal.  You can choose spicy on I think everything, but the level of heat is pushing my limit so I mixed it up.  everything tasted great!  My son had a burrito and it was packed with asada and it must have weighed 16 oz. I bet.  It was huge!  He loved it but he couldn't finish it.    I've recommended this place to so many people and everyone that has tried it keeps asking me; "when are we going back?!"  I'm looking forward to going back again soon.  I hope to see you there!

Need a good cup of coffee and you're at Sky Harbor?  Head to terminal 4 and find Press Coffee down at the end of the terminal.  Their coffee is a fresh roast with a lite aroma and smooth finish.  I particularly like getting a double shot Americano with a little room.  It's very tasty and a great way to start your flight to wherever you're headed.  As you can see by my check ins I'm here a lot and its because of their coffee and service.     I hope to see you see there.

It's a fantastic place to have fellowship with other followers of Christ and to celebrate our King, God and Savior.  The children's ministry is awesome as well.   It's loads of fun for everyone.   I hope to see you there.

Daisy Mountain coffee roasters opened a new coffee house in the Tramonto marketplace and it is awesome!  It is locally owned and operated by a family that has a passion for coffee.  They use an in-house roaster which master roaster Al, the owner, uses to create different blends of coffee.  They are all great!    They also serve breakfast and lunch with plenty of good eats to choose from.  They also have teas, smoothies and other drink options as well.    It's a great new coffee house especially for the neighborhood area.  I hope to see you there someday soon.
