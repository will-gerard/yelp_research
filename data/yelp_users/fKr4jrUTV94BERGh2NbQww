This place has been really good to me! The Tempe location is spot on! I'm against huge corporate places like the majority of people posting on here but here's the thing -- I went to a mom and pop shop and I was nearly scammed! They had no problem taking my money and sending me on my way with a piece of crap guitar. Tempe GC hooked me up, no pressure to buy, no hassle refunds or exchanges. Nice guys, great used gear!

Buffalo Tempe is the best. Awesome deals and great customer service. It's such an eclectic of style and taste I'm rarely disappointed when I shop here! The one in Phoenix is over run by unrealistic hipster clothing sometimes it gets annoying so I leave it up to the Tempe crew to save the day.

I really enjoyed my steak and gourmet fries, on another occasion I had a cheeseburger that rocked me. The service is great and the atmosphere is incredible. Went with a group of people and we reserved a private room.

First off I made a Yelp account just to review this place.-- HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU PEOPLE EAT THIS? I am utterly shocked that this place has tolerable reviews! Do you people even have taste buds or do you normally just eat trash? I guess compared to dumpster food you might think this place was good. Don't get me wrong the greeter was awesome, great customer service and sociable skills. But it's the food that matters, right? So let's get to it.. The pizza was down right AWFUL. My wife and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating a few slices. It was lunch hour on a Saturday and it was DEAD. 2 people were there and they were well into their 70's. The pizza was cold, cheese was hard, pepperoni's were burnt... We even got a few fresh slices (packed with this cheese that had a weird tint to it) It was a deep dish pepperoni pizza with pineapple.  I took one bite and the rubber martian cheese filled my mouth. It tasted like I was chewing silly putty that someone poured tomato paste from a can on it. Ci Ci's pizza tastes like a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump. We ate what we could tolerate and left within 20 minutes. (because we just spent close to 16 bucks on this crap and couldn't just bail without something) ---- LONG STORY SHORT. We wasted $15 and some change that we could have gone to Ci Ci's or Little Caesars with. Never going again. EVER.  I shiver at the thought of eating there again. Prison food sounds better than this crap.

The food is good for fried Mexican fast food. I feel that they overcharge for the amount of food you receive and I was under the impression that it was an actual restaurant instead of somewhere where you'd seat yourself. Can't say I'd go back. Their catered stuff is good though.

Went with my wife for our anniversary and we both had steak. Probably the best steak we've had in years! We ate upstairs on the roof, it was quite romantic. They had a shallow pool in the middle with floating candles and flower petals, the roof even opened up to show the stars and night sky. Was very classy. A tad but dark though, I couldn't see very well at first.

3 Months in and I had a gun pulled on me in the parking lot, Our main wall caved in due to the heat and rain flooding, We have termites, Unsupervised ghetto neighborhood kids constantly throwing glass bottles in the parking lot, The windows are falling out and there are no screens, Our front door has no weather stripping so we have a HUGE gap that lets bugs and outside weather right in. I've called and talked to the office about all of these problems and they called me a complainer and said "sometimes you just have to live with it." They purposely don't answer my calls or e-mails and I now have to use a Google Voice number to even get anyone to answer.   They've even gone as far as actively trying to evict me for ANYTHING out of spite. Small piece of trash on your steps? Legal notice of eviction. We believe you have a dog (which we do not)... Legal notice of eviction. They claim that they've gotten "numerous complaints" of us leaving things on our porch and throwing trash over our railing... COMPLETELY FABRICATED. All because I held them to the same standard they promised me before moving in.    There is no AC here. It's not an Air Conditioner. It's what they call a "chiller system"... There is no thermostat. We have an "ON" and "OFF" button. When we're hot we turn it to "ON" and hope for the best. Oh and winter time they switch the ON & OFF button to heat so if you're hot they say just open a window. WE WENT 2 WEEKS WITH NO COLD AIR IN THE BLAZING SUMMER.   Listen... Somebody from the Standard will reply to this with a nice message but you need to see through their bull crap. I expect them to try and evict me for even saying anything here. It's really that messed up.
