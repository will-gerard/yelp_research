I found him on Facebook and took my husband's truck in. Randy is very friendly and does an amazing job! Prices are great and I will be taking my car also. I would highly recommend him. Family owned and you feel right at home!

Horrible! I went and got my niece and I gel manicures and pedicures. They failed to mention gel was $15.00 extra in each thing. I took a picture of how I wanted my nails and they said no problem, well the owner that spoke English. I picked out my colors and the tech did a totally different one. She kept saying nice nice which I responded no, it's not what I want. I showed the picture over and over and said no. Thank god the owner came over and I was able to tell her. She fixed them for me as best she could which still looked NOTHING like the picture. She said please tell the tech if you don't like them which I said I told her several times and she doesn't understand English. She said oh she was in an accident and can't learn English. Well, then don't hire her!!!! I paid $140.00 for the worst nails and treatment EVER! Major ripoff! My biggest thing is don't let people work there that don't or can't learn English! Never going back!

I accidentally hit one star. I would never recommend this place ever! The prices are outrageous for the food they produce. The staff did not get any of our orders right. Worst burger place I've been to in a while! My family and I will stick with Freddy's!

This is only our second time here and Richie remembered our names. The atmosphere is very family friendly. The food is unbelievable. The beans melt in your mouth and the green Chile is out of this world!
