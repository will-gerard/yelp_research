Panang curry was the most perfect level of spice but only consisted of chicken. No other vegetables, which I found odd. Not enough broth with the chicken to sop up the rice. Tried the beef jerky that everyone talks about. I dunno what the hype is. This place is okay... Not my top choice for Thai.

They are wonderful! Took my white quilt that had ink smatterings all over (pen mishap) and got them all out for me. Very friendly & efficient.
