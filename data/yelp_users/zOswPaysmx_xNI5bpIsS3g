came here for the first time on my birthday.  Took the wine 101 class. its on a monday night at 6pm. It was sooo much fun and I learned so much.  The wine was all really great and it came with delicious little pairings for each different glass.  The women who taught the class was great. I feel back I can't remember her name but she was so cute and was super knowledgable.  The best part its very reasonably prices so I love that

absolutely adored this place!  Breakfast: had the eggs benedict: pretty tasty the only thing I would say was it was a little bit too buttery for my taste but that didn't stop me from devouring the whole plate. they serve you a fresh baguette at your table which I thought was a nice touch.  I had their mimosa that was good but it was pretty over priced for how big it was. $10 for a champagne sized glass but then again its vegas right so what isn't over priced on the strip.  dinner: -Baked brie appetizer: DELICIOUS! -filet medallions wrapped in bacon: steak was cooked perfectly I have no complains here    our waiter helped us pick out the perfect bottle of wine to go with our dinner. he was very helpful  I would highly recommend this place to anyone trying to find a nice romantic dinner but without paying a fortune.  Everything on the menu is actually pretty reasonably priced which is why we went there for breakfast and dinner while we were there.

it was okkay nothing spectacular.  I had the shrimp fajitas they were not that good.  Honestly if you have ever eaten at Chevy's and had their fajitas you know that they are just okkay, nothing special and even this place was worse then that!  But its a convenient location and its kind of a fun atmosphere. I did however try the Mac N Cheese and it was pretty decent so maybe i just picked the wrong plate. Don't know if I'd come back and try this place again.

I came here a few weeks ago and am just now getting around to reviewing this place.    Let me first say that I just moved here and as a foodie I was in an absolute panic to find some new favorite spots (pathetic I know but my life revolves around food what can I say)   Neways came here on a Tuesday...SCORE! half off on wine by the bottle and by the glass.  Had the lunch special. Small Salad, Personal Pan Pepperoni Pizza. The pizza was delicious. I love love love thin crust pizza and it was perfect. If you're a deep dish person you may want to go for the calzone although I didn't try it so I can't say if its good or not.   The best part was when the bill came it was only $25 for two people.  That was two small salads and two personal pizzas and a glass of wine.  Not back at all for lunch. I will definetly be a patron here again and again.

I LOVED this place.  Probably the best place I ate at all weekend. lets see what we ate: -Crunchy Spicy Tuna: had avocado, spicy tuna, spicy mayo sauce and a crunchy topping it was AMAZING! i loved it -Baked Lobster Roll: baked lobster, rice paper roll, asparagus, miso sauce.  it was all wrapped up and then baked and the miso sauce is nice and toasted and warm it was soo delicious -spicy scallop roll: i had the cut roll not the hand roll. honestly it was just okkay. nothing super spectacular -shrimp fried rice: pretty yummy just your basic fried rice we all shared it and it was good -miso soup: perfect not too salty but just right I mean lets be honestly everything in Vegas is expensive so I don't think the prices were outraged compared to everywhere else. I think for the price it is way better then anywhere else that we went.  If u are a sushi lover like I am then i think you will enjoy this place and bonus ITS AIR CONDITIONED inside the mall so its nice!

Tried this for the first time last night and absolutely LOVED IT!  Seared Scallops with mushroom risotto: it was amazing! the scallops were perfectly caramelized and the mushroom risotto was soo creamy and delicious.  It also came with these crispy shallots on top which added another nice crunch to the dish. We came during happy hour so we ordered a bottle of wine which was half off! can't complain about that! even the bread they brought to your table came with a yummy flavored butter. Seriously don't have anything bad to say about this restaurant.

i'm not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating. I tried this the other weekend for the first time and it was amazing!  Tried: Classic Margarita it was delicious  Queso Chorizo appetizer: another delicious dish  but my absolute favorite thing was the cheese enchilada that I got for my main course.  They bring it out in a mini cast iron pan and instead of rolled enchiladas it was like an enchilada pie and it was sooo amazing I dont even think I swallowed one bite I basically just inhaled it!  Only complaint is that they do NOT take reservations unless you have a party of 8 or more :( seriously?! so either get their early or go late if you want to get in and out. Otherwise expect a wait and have a drink or two at the bar while you wait

Great Price and Good Food!  I think the reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the customer service that they provide.  All the staff members work together as a team and it made the experience wonderful. You need a new clean plate? Their on it! You want something you havn't see come out yet? No problem they'll go get it. Another cocktail? well they have someone coming around with a mobile cart to bring you one! I was 100% satisfied with the customer service end.  The food was pretty good. Now don't get me wrong it was delicious. However I am comparing it to another Brazilian steakhouse I've been to in San Francisco and for around the same price their food is EXCELLENT. Now the customer service on the other hand is not as good. I wasn't overly impressed with the salad bar,  I would probably skip it next time I go and just focus on stuffing my face with more meat!  Bottom line: Great food and exceptional customer service. I would come here again in a heartbeat.

Came here for a bikini wax the other morning and I could not be happier with the service.  I just moved in the area and was looking for a place I could feel comfortable with.  After all if I'm going to be letting anyone near my bikini line I better feel safe and clean!  And that is exactly what I got.  The front reception room is super welcoming and the receptionist (I forgot her name unfortunately) was very nice.    Amanda did my wax and I can't think of anything to complain about.  She made me feel very comfortable and made my appointment stress free and easy.  I will absolutely be coming here from now on.  I felt so welcomed and left very happy.  Oh and they also had this great lotion to put on after to prevent in grown hair and its only been a day and the redness is all gone or red bumps in sight yay!

Just plain bad all the way around. I had one of those giant fishbowl margarita's and it was way too overly sweet. not a good margarita at all.  I didn't even eat dinner there but tried some of my friends dishes.  The ceviche was a total rip off.  it was like $15 and it came with a tiny tiny portion like honestly its ridiculously how tiny the portion was.  come here for the atmosphere and nothing else.  Don't expect much for food quality here.

Love this place!  Have come here twice in the last two weeks or so. First time was for breakfast. Had the Croque Madame which was delicious, the only thing I didn't like was the tiny side of fruit it came with because it didn't look super appetizing so I didnt event touch that. They have a bar there too so I also had a mimosa which came with fresh squeezed oj.   Came again for dinner a week later and loved it again.  The grilled chicken was delicious, also had chips and quac for a snack that was good. Honestly I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu. I really like this place its cute and casual and it has a nice rounded menu. Really anyone could find something in it to eat.  Will absolutely be coming back again.

I'm obsessed with the Fondue! If you've never been you have to have to have to get the  provolone fondue with the pretzel rolls. So good! but warning it is very filling. If you come in a group of three or more than one is fine with a meal but if there is just two of you, be prepared to take some of your lunch/dinner home or eat a salad afterwards.    I also love the French Dip sandwich I get it every time because it is just so good and its one of my favorite sandwiches.   Other good ones: fried chicken!

I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience.   My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks.  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite.  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat.  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus.  This woman was soo rude, she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu, the nerve!) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters.  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu.  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us, rolled her eyes, shook her head and then darted into some back room. (SERIOUSLY! is that a joke?!)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating, there was one othe so we just got up and left all together.    I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family.   Super disappointing.  What ever happened to good customer service??

SO DELICIOUS!  had dinner here last night with my boyfriend and it was amazing.  Cheese fondue and pretzel rolls are a must!!! had some cheese and meats that we picked at and we shared an entree.  The steak was really good. perfectly cooked and I really enjoyed the horseradish cream sauce that came with it.  Even the seasonal veggies that I normally just pick and and leave were really good.

Amazing!!!  First time having authentic polish, Canadian and Scandinavian food!   Everything was delicious. You have to get the schnitzel! It's just a must. The Poutine is great too. I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this place.   P.S. Food can take a little time but it's worth the wait and it's made to order so really how can you complain?!

ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!  Drinks: amazing! I had the pear martini I forget the exact name but it was perfect. not overly sweet in my opinion  Food: what's not good?! Calamari: they give you the calamari tenders instead of the chewy rings.  You can tell its very fresh and its perfectly breaded.  The dipping sauce is amazing lobster bisque: one of my favorite lobster bisques i've ever had. Tide Roast: combination of different shellfish/seafood in a tomato based broth with a big pile or rice. Delicious! Fish and Chips: perfectly crispy, really good whole grain mustard dipping sauce  Honestly you can't go wrong here. everything is really good and the staff is very friendly and welcoming!
