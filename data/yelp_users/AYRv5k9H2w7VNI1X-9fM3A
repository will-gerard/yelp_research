Machaca Burro is ridiculous and the butter tortilla will take you to the promised land

Good Chinese food is hard to find in this town, Finally experienced Tottie's and it is the best I have found in the valley...Good Thai selection with good flavor

If I was simply reviewing the service & food I would be at around 2 stars.....it's not that great.  But why 4 stars you ask? Karaoke my friend, if you haven't been to The Grapevine on a Saturday night for Karaoke you are missing out.  I thoroughly embarrassed my self last weekend and I suggest you do the same.

I hit this place up for lunch on a fairly frequent basis, awesome Italian beef sandwich and a great Deli feel with authentic Italian grocery items.  Also one cool thing about this place is they make homemade pizza dough everyday that you can buy to take home and make your own pie.

The only + is that it is open 24 hours, other than that your paying way too much for yet another mediocre phoenix based sandwich shop

I have been here 2 times and both times it has been awesome.  A low key atmosphere combined with some original draft beers and throw in hot pockets on steroids and it is a good combo!

It took until my 3rd terrible experience at this place to finally write a review.  Be ready for hundreds of dollars of "preventative maintenance" up sells and terrible customer service.  We took our car and we had a time commitment which they promised to meet since we had to be across town at a specific time to try and sell the car.  45 minutes past out deadline we finally got the car back and pissed off the potential buyer in the process! Their solution was a free $10 car wash, thanks Danny's!

I have probably left my dogs here around 4-5 times and everytime I get them out of the car to go in they act like sled dogs pulling me in to the doors....this is usually a good sign that they are fans as well.  Cost effective compared to every other kennel I have called or experienced and the owners are very nice & helpful.  Also they have cameras set up so if you want to check on the website you can.

Stumbled upon this place while running around 1st Friday in downtown Phoenix.....The positive first before the negatives, cool ambiance, that is why it is getting 2 stars.  Now the negative.....paid 15$ for some of the worst gnocchi I have ever had, incredibly mushy with no texture or substance at all....portions were tiny they do not offer you bread?  An Italian restaurant that will not give you bread....we asked our snooty waitress if we could have some bread before our meal and she said they do not have bread to give us....10 minutes later our meals come out and low and behold guess what is in the pasta bowl.....bread!, lol. Maybe I caught this place on a bad night but to me it is once again another restaurant here in the valley that puts on a good show and trendy atmosphere but does not have any substance behind it.

Found this place thanks to yelp and I am glad I checked it out.  Nice laid back atmosphere with a help yourself style.  I had the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict and the jalapeno corn bread was awesome.  Also had the Chorizo, peppers & jalapeno cream cheese Brizza and that was also very good.  If you are looking for a new breakfast joint with some new takes on traditional breakfast food I would give Scramble a try.

From my experience up to this point this place is hands down the best taco shop in PHX.  The salsa bar is awesome with a ton of options and their street tacos along with the gourmet tacos are great.

I have only been here once so this review is simply based on a one lunch stand.  I ordered the Vegetable sandwich and they did not have the roasted red peppers or the grilled eggplant so these two things were automatically substituted with mushrooms and tomatoes?  The guy making my sandwich could not speak english so their was no "hey man is it cool if we don't have the red pepper and eggplant" conversation.   The hummus was pretty good on the sandwich but the bread salad side didn't taste like anything.  That is your only option also is either a bag of chips or bland bread salad.    Thirdly a sandwich and a drink was like $13 bucks.  I don't mind spending money on good food but this seemed kinda steep for a lackluster lunch.  With Daily Dose right next door I am not sure what would be making me go back to this place.

Very good street tacos with some good drink specials as well.  Tucked back in a strip mall but still a pretty cool atmosphere once you get inside.

I had a really good experience at this place.  Started with the chilled cilantro lime crab dip.  I wasn't sure about fried plantain dippers but they worked.  If you go here you have to get the Thai bbq baby back ribs.  They were awesome!  Next best thing I had was the mac & cheese and also the spinach & parsnip gratin - good stuff.  Ended with the guinness chocolate cake which was pretty good but next time I think I will go for the s'mores creme brulee.  All in all a good time and would recommend.

Man I was very disappointed with my experience at Big Earl's.  Maybe I hit it on a bad night but the food was not good at all.  It might have been the saltiest BBQ I think I have ever had.  My girlfriend and I left dinner with that weird salt feeling on the back of our tongues.  I got the Brisket sliders and instead of strips of brisket it was diced up meat smothered in BBQ and salt.  It almost felt like it was 2 day old brisket that they wanted to reuse so they diced it up and slapped it on a slider bun, they tasted it and said oh crap that is bland 2 day old brisket and poured salt on it.  Meat was super greasy and the deep fried pickles were crazy salty as well.  I'm giving them 2 stars because the fries were pretty good and they give you about 2 lbs.

The food is always top notch and the so are the drinks.  Come to think of it so is the vibe and the service, so I guess that makes it a no brainer.  It has some constants on the menu that are all good and everyday there is a new entree which has always been awesome.  Go check it out, you won't regret it.

#TacoTuesday destination.  Good prices, awesome El Pastor and Fish taco.  Chicken was somewhat boring but still a great spot.

Carne Asada street taco along with the Pork taco are awesome.  Best chips I have had a taco shop up to this point with great fresh salsa.  Fish taco is fresh piece of non-fried fish and is very good.

Finally something cool opened up in this location. I vote they bulldoze they entire block and expand an outdoor bar / restaurant. Good beer and good food so far.
