After shopping around for a few weeks, we bought a 2015 vehicle from Bo today. I truly do not think the process could have been more seamless. He was so professional and just overall enjoyable to work with. The finance guy (John? Sorry... I think that's it) was so great to work with as well. Quick, efficient and personable. We will recommend this place to everyone.

Very good pizza and wings. It was packed so my fiancé and I had to sit in the very back tiny corner. (Hostess asked if we minded, to be fair.) I've had better antipasta.. But the pizza and wings make up for that. Yum.

I do not understand why this place is rated so low.. I am extremely critical when reviewing places and this place was AMAZING. Our waitress was Natalie.. She was I think the best waitress I've ever had. You can tell she loves her job (or at least pretended really well.) she asked if we were in a hurry from the start... I'm pregnant and tired.. She didn't drag on her speech. She was fast. Never an empty drink. Just an all around amazing experience! And the food was awesome. We will be back!

So glad to of found our new go to Chinese restaurant. Everything was AMAZING. We got egg drop soup, crab puffs, general tsao chicken, curry chicken, & noodles. Not a single complaint. We ate there, but next time will get it delivered. I overheard another guest in the restaurant saying "we just drove across town to eat here again." HUGE portion sizes. We can't wait to order again!

Valle Luna is amazing. My fiancé and I split a steak fundido. Their salsa is PERFECT. (Mix hot & mild) the parking is always horrible.. So go at off hours. Service is always fast. It's our favorite go to local Mexican joint. Yum.

Honestly, I don't know where to start. From start to finish the entire experience with Prenatal Peak was PERFECT. He was so helpful while booking the appointment. Called day before appointment to confirm... Then the appointment itself was AMAZING. I so wish I could remember the sonographers name (you'd think I would. It was just yesterday) but I can't say enough good things about her.  She was so excited just as much as me and daddy it seems. We got to see our LITTLE GIRL. I can't wait to go back in a couple months :)

I do not even know where to BEGIN.  First.. I did review this place months back after taking my little dog here for a bath and nail trim.. it was $17. (She is 6lbs) All was well. A couple months later I brought my other little dog in for a hair cut. (Shaved all down. He is 6 lbs) it was $17. Last weekend I took BOTH little dogs in... It almost $60. Something didn't add up. I simply stated it seemed higher then the previous times. She said she did not have a record for my 2nd little dog. Weird? Well I do.. I have the bank statement of $17 and a picture I took of him same day leaving their place. The groomer called me later that day and said it bothered her I thought it was more expensive last time and that she would "check her records..." And call me back because that "isnt a way to run a business." Weird? You told me you didn't have a record for my dog? So. I checked MY banks statements from October (last time he got a cut) $17. I called her back to let her know.. I don't want the $22 back. I just wanted her to know. She said "I'm sorry! What is your phone number and name again so I can check my records at home for October. I will call you tomorrow!" Weird? A week later.. Still haven't heard from them.  SECOND... The last after my 6 lb dog left there.. Every time you would touch her back she would yelp out of pain. 2 trips to the vet later.. She is now on two antibiotic / steroids for a SKIN INFECTION. Her entire back skin under her fur is basically peeling. It is awful. My vet said this is the second complaint on this groomer.   I am not happy and will NEVER take my dogs back here.

So let me start with.. I had never had Pho until I went here on Thursday. With that being said, I have nothing to compare Pho Avina to. But .. reviewing service and food. Service- good. Fast. Helpful. Food - we had spicy beef soup, chicken and shrimp soup and coffee boba. All was really good.

So glad we found this place. GOOD sushi right down the street from us? Yes please. It is very small though. I can manage. :)

Let me start with 1 star is too much.   THE WORST COFFEE SHOP IN THE WORLD. Subpar drinks. AWFUL customer service. Slow slow SLOW!! I've seen lobsters crawl faster than that place. I will drive 10 miles out of my way and still get my coffee before this place. AND it's dirty.  So long..

So glad we found this place on Yelp. Seriously our favorite breakfast. So much better than The Place. My boyfriend is already making plans to go back tomorrow. Ha!

Finally tried this place after driving by a million times. I got two enchiladas and my fiancé got a carne Asada. Both were very good. Chips & salsa were great as well.

I should probably start by saying.. I am pregnant and had been looking forward to this CHEESE burger all day. I ordered ONE CHEESE burger WITH onion... And a French fry. Lady asked if I will be eating in the car, I said No.. She says "okay we will bag that for you." Great. I get to the window... Lady tries handing me a box of food. I said no... I need that bagged.. She acted put off By it. I get home.. Still excited.. Open my burger... It's a patty, bread and lettuce..... Clearly not what I ordered. Receipt CLEARLY says what I ordered. I'll keep driving a little further to bell rd. I attached a picture for a visual. Ha. Not happy

Love my Dutch. Usually go to Bell Rd.. But this ones closer to my house so we go here a lot too. Iced Milky Way (or carmelizer for new folks).... Deeeelish.

It means a lot for me to go out of my way and write a review..  Because toddler. Haha, I don't have time. But.. The Wing Counter deserves it. I've been there four times now. The food and service are both incredible. Tonight was exceptional  though. I like extra TWC seasoning on my wings. I asked for it, they may or may not have done it, I don't know. They were delicious regardless. Martez (sorry if I butchered your name) asked me how they were and if it were enough seasoning. I said ehh, could use more but I was NOT complaining. They were still great. Five minutes later, he walked out with a dozen extra TWC seasoned wings for me. THAT'S customer service my friends.  Also, best chocolate chip cookies ever.
