Excellent quality, great prices and large portions!  All of the staff is very friendly and outgoing.  Definitely one of our favorite sushi restaurants in the valley.  A great spot for lunch.  The Sakana lunch is a great value (sub the California roll for spicy tuna for $1).

Everything we ordered was just...bad.  The General Tso's chicken was overly breaded, mushy and barely seasoned.  Mongolian Beef lacked flavor and was a bit of a mess.  Fried rice was too oily and lacked flavor. Brown rice was over cooked.

Los Taquitos rocks!  The carne asada burrito and the cheese quesadilla  are my favorites!

This is absolutely by far one of my favorite places to eat!  Everything is prepared healthy and is absolutely delicious!  I can't wait for their Ahwatukee location to open!  I have been asking for an Ahwatukee location for some time and finally my dreams have come true!  Thanks Pita Jungle!  P.S.  The spicy chicken wrap is one of my favorites but everything I have ever tried is good!

I must confess that I'm not really that big of a Starbucks fan (coffee-wise), but this is my favorite Starbucks in the whole wide world, mostly because the staff here is the best of the best.  They pump out the orders and do it with a smile.  Oh yeah I also met my beautiful, amazing, awesome wife here :)

I would highly recommend this shop!  Very friendly and very honest.  Very fair prices too!  They've replaced a radiator for me and did a great job and charged a fair price.  I have recommended them to several of my friends and they were highly satisfied.

Some of the best panang curry that I have had in the valley! Everything on the menu that I've had has been great. Excellent service too!  Can't wait to go back!

Great beer, great food & great service!  One of my favorite spots to eat in Tempe.  Absolutely love the Salmon BLT!  Service and food are always spot on and always served up quickly.

Oregeno's is a great place to go with the family or a large group and ingest like 4 million calories. The artichoke dip, spinach salad, and pizzas are very good.  I'm still shaking my head at the fact that they don't have ricotta as a topping though!  Oh, the pizzokie is like another 1 million calories but it is totally worth it.

Good food, good service and nice patio.  First time here.  Had the salmon salad and an iced tea with raspberries.  Both were very tasty.  Will definitely go back sometime for dinner on the patio.

Very disappointed... Nice clean place and very friendly staff, but the food just really isn't that good!  The coffee was weak but flavorful, the OJ was good (freshly squeezed), the wheat toast with preserves was good, the pancake was very plain, the home fries were bland and covered in grease, the pork chop was under seasoned/bland, and the eggs were good but greasy.  Not worth the wait in my opinion.

Love this place!  The butterfish is absolutely heavenly.  Probably the best fish I have had in town.  Great service and excellent food.  A bit pricey, but worth it.

Sushi is always fresh and they give you healthy portions for a great price!  Their hot green tea is excellent.  Sashimi portions are very generous.  My favorite rolls are the Chunky Spicy Yellowtail and Chunky Spicy Tuna...huge rolls (8 pcs) and only $5 each!  My only complaint is that the service can be a bit slow at times.

Costco is truely an amazing store.  Great prices, great products and great customer support.  I was leaving the store last week and as always they checked my receipt and cart to make sure all was good.  They noticed that I was charged for 2 bottles of Kettle One, but I only bought one.  They quickly called another employee who promptly brought me the money they overcharged me.  Go Costco!

I hate giving bad reviews, but this place is not good.  The roasted jalapeño rellenos were terrible.  The Pollo Fundido is supposedly one of the more popular dishes, but was very bland.  The trio of salsas and chips they provide were ok, but nothing special.  The wait staff were friendly and attentive.

We've been here a couple of times for breakfast and we've had great experiences both times.  The Eggs Benedict with salmon & chorizo scramble were our favorites.  Love the fingerling potatoes too!  Can't wait to come back and taste the dinner menu!

Wow!  Sooooooo Good! First time here and we had a great experience.  We had the bibim bap and the beef bulgogi.  Both were excellent.  Everything was seasoned perfectly and had so much flavor.  Excellent service as well.  We will definitely be back.

This place is awesome!! My girlfriend and I went here for the first time this afternoon for lunch.  They gave us a small sample platter of four different types of humus and toasted pitas on the house.   They were all good, but the artichoke was our favorite.   We both ordered the Gyro with a side salad for our meal.  We came a little late so we were the only people there.  Service was very quick.  Both the salad and the Gyro were fantastic!  The gyro is probably one of the best I've ever had!  The meat was VERY tender and had an amazing flavor... seasoned perfectly! We will definitely be back for more!! We even ordered a large order of the humus to go.

One of my favorite spots to eat in Ahwatukee.  I love how they use a lot of locally sourced ingredients.  Everything that I've tried on the menu has been good.  I highly recommend the Asado Chicken Salad, the Suki Rice Bowl (with spicy tuna), the pulled pork sandwich & the corn on the cob. Lots of bottled craft brews to pick from and some local brews on tap.  Great spot for breakfast too.  I like the coffee and iced teas here.

I absolutely love this place!!  I am not a vegetarian, but this is one of my favorite places to eat.  The food is consistently amazing and the staff is always super friendly.  Great for breakfast, lunch and dessert.  My favorites meals are the California Love Wrap, Tacos Vivos, Elephant Curry Bowl, Arizona Roll & the Lumberjack Sandwich.  Honestly though, everything is amazing.  Their juices and smoothies are excellent too...my favorites are the Greeña Colada and the Braveheart.  All of the desserts are amazing, but my favorite is the raw Snickers bar.  The coffee is excellent too!  Some people complain that it's expensive, but I think it is well worth the money for quality ingredients.

STAY AWAY!!!  Had an appointment for 12-2pm today and they called at 1:55pm to say they would be 1hr & 30mins late.  At 5:40pm (2hrs & 10mins after the new time they quoted) we called them back and told them about the situation.  They lady on the phone was extremely rude and did not offer any assistance in the matter.

I've been to Le Ragazze a handful of times and my past experiences have always been great, but my last visit was not so good...  Upon arriving we immediately noticed the menu had changed (we heard they have new owners).  Our favorite appetizer was gone and some of the other dishes were gone as well.  We decided to skip the appetizer. I ordered one of the specials - a bone in rib eye with some kind of mushroom sauce.  I ordered my steak medium rare.  My girlfriend ordered another special - Scallops with pasta.  They gave us some bread with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette.  It was ok, but the bread was rather bland in my opinion.  Our meals came out promptly and looked delicious.  I cut into my steak and it was well done.  I requested the server have them recook me a steak medium rare and my girlfriend and I shared her meal...  Her scallops were cooked perfectly, but we both agreed that the dish was under seasoned...  My second steak came out and I cut into it immediately (before they left this time.  The initial cut looked good so I thanked them and proceeded to taste the steak.   All I can say is - bland!  This steak had no flavor whatsoever.... all I could taste was the char. Then I made my second cut  and we discovered that my steak was way undercooked.  I'm talking rarer than rare!  I swear I could still hear the thing mooing!  I didn't feel like wasting any more time sending the steak back again (and I'm always a bit scared about sending stuff back) so we decided to take the rest of the steak home for the dogs.     I still can't believe I spent $36 on that steak!   I should asked for a refund, but I didnt...  At least the dogs liked it :)

Ugh... what a disappointment!   Atmosphere was a little blah in my opinion.... had a cheap feel to it.   No lunch menu so we were force to pay dinner prices $34 including tip. Chips were okay, but both the green and red salsas were awful!  I don't even know how to explain the flavor... no bueno! I ordered the Chile Relleno and my girl ordered the enchilada/taco combo.  We weren't impressed with either dish.  Mediocre at best. Everything seemed a bit over seasoned (and maybe just not seasoned well)...   Really unfortunate because we were hoping for a good Mexican restaurant close to home :(

Excellent gelato!  It reminded me of the gelato I've had in Italy.  The Stracciatella was wonderful and the waffle cone it came in was tasty as well.  My wife's raspberry sorbet was delicious too.  The owners were very nice.  We will definitely be back for more the next time we are in the area.

Tate and Ben are very honest, trustworthy and charge a fair price.  I've called on them multiple times now and they are always punctual and do an excellent job.  They take the time to explain and/or show you what the problem is.  Thank you!

One of our new favorite spots!  Great service and excellent food.  Everything we ordered was very tasty and fresh.  My fiancée called the grilled cheese "decadent".  We also ordered the pear of tomatoes pasta and the perfect pear classic salad, both were fantastic!  Patio allows dogs and they even hooked us up with a water bowl for our pup.

I am a huge fan of Citizen Public House so we decided to try out The Gladly during restaurant week.  I had the chopped salad, the scallops and the bread pudding.  Everything was top notch.  The chopped salad and scallops were just like the ones at Citizen Public House - excellent!  I also tried a their sazerac which was very tasty.  I like the location and the feel of Citizen Public House better, but this is a nice addition to the Biltmore corridor.

We've been here a couple of times and have always been pleased with our experience.  The kale salad with salmon is very good as is the flying avocado wrap.  Im not too impressed with the Spicy Salmon Nabemono...it falls a bit short in the flavor department.  Their teas and lemonade are tasty, but be careful with the lemonade as it can be a bit sugary.  The sweet corn and quinoa side is a must try!

Very very pleased with my experience at Maple Bear.  The entire staff is very friendly and take great care of our little one.  The teacher to infant ratio is 3:1 (up to 1 year of age) which was a big selling point for us.  At our old day care it seemed our little one was always confined to an infant chair...at Maple Bear they are constantly engaged with him teaching or playing.

We are very pleased with our experience at Maple Bear.  The entire staff is very friendly and caring.  The teacher to infant ratio is 3:1 (up to 1 year of age) which was a big selling point for us.  Our previous daycare center seemed much less interactive with the kids and most of the time the kids were confined to an infant chair.  At Maple Bear they are constantly engaging, teaching or playing with the children.  The facility is always very clean.

Ruchi is amazing!  We stopped in for the lunch buffet yesterday afternoon on our way the Lee Lee's market.  The buffet has a great variety with many vegan dishes to choose from.  We tried almost everything on the buffet and we loved everything!  Everything was seasoned very well.  The owner checked on us multiple times and was very friendly.  We will definitely be back!

Would not honor a valid coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Coupon was for one free entree when you buy two entrees - up to $13 value.  Server said that the system would not let her enter the coupon unless one of the entrees was over $13.  I argued that was not what the coupon said and she agreed but said there was nothing she could do.  Shady.

A great addition to downtown Chandler.  Friendly owners and staff.  A very cool interior and has plenty of comfortable seating options. We both tried the iced dolce de leite.  I don't usually opt for sweet drinks but it was pretty tasty.  We also tried a chocolate cupcake that we were told was from a local baker...it was excellent.  The have almond milk and soy as milk alternatives and also have organic cane syrup and raw unfiltered honey.
