I'm writing this review on behalf of my husband because he won't get his hair cut anywhere but V's.  Even on a busy day, he never has to wait that long to get in, and he loves the straight razor shave and quick massage with that little machine they put on their hand.

The parking is HORRIBLE!  The setup for ordering is confusing and disorganized.  I can totally look past all that though with one bite of the pressed tuna sandwich.  Sheer deliciousness!!  I also ordered two dessert bites: a small red velvet cupcake and a mini chocolate cupcake.  I wished I hadn't ordered them in the mini size.  One bite was just not enough!  They were so moist with just the right sweetness.  If I can suck it up and get in a zen mood to deal with the parking and the crazy ordering line, I will absolutely be back!    If you are planning on having a nice conversation with a friend, eat outside.  I could barely hear myself think!

Cheba Hut makes great tasting sandwiches.  I usually get the Italian with extra pickle.  They brought me the wrong sandwich today, but the guy figured out the mistake and corrected it quickly.  The gooey marshmallow balls are to die for, so if you see them near the register, just buy one already!

Just so we can get this straight; this is the ORIGINAL Nello's.  The others are franchised and they really just can't hold a candle to this location.  After a series of bad experiences at the location at McClintock and Southern, the hubby and I made the trek to this location, hoping for a better outcome.  We were immediately greeted and took our seats at the bar.  The bartender got us drinks right away and was very quick and extremely friendly throughout our entire meal.  The owner, Brian came over and talked to us and was very friendly talking to all the other patrons.  They either have a ton of regulars, or the people that work here are just super friendly.  The salad and pizza were just as I had remembered them to be.  They were cooked and served properly and quickly.  This is the location we will be frequenting from now on!

We tried this carwash for the second time yesterday hoping for a little better results.  Once we saw our car come through the carwash, it was evident that there were too many cars and not enough employees to handle them all.  We ordered "The Works" which includes vacuuming and wiping the interior.  The exterior looked great, but as we drove away, we realized that the entire dashboard area hadn't been touched.  The guy was obviously too rushed to realize he completely missed that part.  Third time won't be a charm because we probably won't be back.

My hubby and I have always liked Teakwoods for many reasons.  You can't go wrong with a place that serves shelled peanuts.  I love that little salty snack before a meal while I'm enjoying a cold beer.  They have great drink and food specials everyday and a specialty beer that is always a good price.  We love the nachos because they are absolutely loaded!  Teakwoods is a great place to watch a game because there are TV's everywhere you look.  I would love if they offered more craft beer because the selection is limited.

I had heard a lot about Flancer's from the "Mouth by Southwest" blog and was interested to try it.  I had heard of multiple tap takeovers and other events so I was excited to see what beers they had on tap.  All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.    The sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape√±o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!

I didn't know this place existed until we stumbled upon it on a day trip to Schnepf Farms last weekend.  We stopped in to look around and ended up buying a BBQ pork burrito and a green chili pork burrito for lunch.  We saw so many things we wanted to buy, we left, went to Fry's to buy a cooler, and returned to put all our goodies in it.  Their brats are amazing, particularly the cheddar cheese ones.  The baked beans with bacon are the perfect blend of sweet and smokey.  We've decided we need to stop in at least once every few months just to stock our freezer!

We stopped in here on the Friday after the Peach Festival, which, according to the reviews, was a good idea.  I would not come here during a festival or a huge event because there doesn't seem to be enough parking and the general store/bakery is too small to accommodate many people.  When you go on a day like we did though, it was incredibly fun and easy.  Hubby and I picked our own white and purple potatoes, carrots, zucchini, and squash.  We bought a peach pie that came right from the oven that tasted like heaven, along with some salsa and delicious BBQ sauce.  We had a great time there and especially loved being able to pick our own veggies.

This resort is beautiful.  From the impeccably manicured grounds to the well appointed rooms, to the open air lobby, this is a great place to spend a vacation.  The pools are large and spread across the back of the hotel.  The golf course is just across the water so you get a great view of the course from the pool.  I love all the little grottoes in the pool area with the waterfalls.  The months just prior and just after summer would be the best to visit here so you could enjoy the pools and the weather.

I can't believe it has taken me this long to review Four Peaks!  Five stars all the way!!  I waited for years for Four Peaks to can their Peach Ale, and it has finally happened.  The Peach Ale is hands down the most refreshing and real peach flavored beer I've ever tasted.  The food is also amazing.  I usually get the beer bread sandwich, but I tried the burger special of the day last time we ate there and it was also great.  Kiltlifter is one of mine and my hubby's favorite beers (and we've tried thousands!)  You can't go wrong with anything there!

I have always loved Dilly's for sandwiches.  Their potato salad is one of my top two favorites of any that I have ever eaten.  I used to get the Honey-do, but their new menu doesn't have it, so I opted for another sandwich that was just as tasty with a sweet mustard on it.    I hadn't been to Dilly's in about a year because I moved to the Northwest Valley where they don't exist, so when I handed them my almost filled punch card, they told me they don't use them anymore.  All was not lost however, because they let me exchange my punch card for a free sandwich!  Done!  Gotta love Dilly's!

Every Sunday growing up, my dad would get the family bagels from Back East.  My sister and I looked forward to every Sunday just for that reason.  I love their bagels and cream cheese and their bagel sandwiches.  Now that I have moved back in the area, Back East is super close again.  Their fresh squeezed OJ is great, and they have a fantastic array of bagel flavors.  The one thing that bugs me sometimes is if you come as late as 9am, lots of the bagel flavors are already sold out.  They usually aren't replaced once they are gone.  I came in once only to find that they were out of all the flavors my hubby and I liked, so I had to walk right back out.

We live very close to Shalimar and frequently spend an afternoon at the driving range here.  Everyone is so nice and friendly and it's a great neighborhood hangout.  The grounds are well kept and there are plenty of trees to keep you cool.  It's only $9 for a large bucket of balls for the driving range.  We haven't done so yet, but we really want to try out the footgolf course!

My family and I have been coming here for years, in fact, I worked here as a server for a semester in college.  I've always loved the salsa here.  It has huge chunks of green chili in it and it's not spicy so you can eat a ton of it.  It's a problem I have actually!  I love their bean burritos and hard tacos, especially the chicken.  Their frozen margaritas are delicious and strong, so be careful!  They'll hit you quick!

I ate here with my family more times than I can count when I was growing up.  It's also one of the go-to spots when my friends from high school want to get together.  This is a quintessential neighborhood pizza restaurant and bar.  They have a good selection of craft beers, including ones from Four Peaks and Stone brewing on tap.  The tortellini toss salad is absolutely to die for, especially when you drown it in their homemade Italian dressing.  The dressing is thick and has a hint of tomato goodness.  I always order the enchilada pizza- black beans, green chili, grilled chicken with a side of sour cream, guac, diced red onions and lettuce.  I load all that stuff on top of the pizza and it is a divine pie.

I have to update my review because of the numerous lackluster experiences my hubby and I have had here recently.  We live so close to this place we can basically walk, so it's a great place to get a beer.  They do have a good beer list, even if it is a little heavy on the IPA's at times.  My hubby likes to sit at the bar and order the chicken enchilada pizza.  The last few times the pizza didn't come with the sour cream and guac and stuff even though he requested it.  The last time he ordered it, the pizza wasn't even cooked all the way through.  We have sat at the bar multiple times and watched the lack of management at this restaurant.  About a month ago, a kid who looked like he was a busser or something, had a huge wad of chewing tobacco in his mouth.  He was going in and out of the kitchen.  I would like to know where he was spitting that crap out!  Disgusting!!  The manager talked to him multiple times right in front of us and didn't tell him to spit it out.  I have observed people waiting for service at the bar for long periods of time and being ignored.  The only one who takes good care of anyone is the blonde lady who typically works at the bar/take-out area.  If she's there, she'll take good care of you, otherwise, there is no sense of urgency from anyone and it seems like not many employees care about how the customers perceive their actions and lack of attentiveness.

LOVE love love Lifetime.  The hubby and I were members of the Gilbert location a few years ago and now we are members of the Tempe location.  I love that all the equipment always works.   I constantly see someone performing maintenance on treadmills and other machines as well.  The staff is friendly and knowledgable.  I love the spa, especially for a haircut.  See Jordan, she knows what sh's doing.

My hubby and I have ordered bagels from this place far more often that we probably should.  We just can't stay away.  The bagels are tasty and moist, chewy yet soft.  We always get the egg, cheese and bacon bagel sandwich and the chorizo burrito.  They both come cut in half so we exchange halves so we can each have half of both meals.  This is the way to go.  We always get extra egg and extra meat on the bagel sandwich though because otherwise the sandwich is a little flat.  It only raises the price by a bit though so I reccommend ordering it that way.  The coffee is tasty and I never drink straight up coffee.  Any day of the week, make sure you come before 10am because that's when everyone and their mother shows up.

We love seeing concerts at Comerica.  The sound is always clear and loud, without all that background static like you will hear at US Airways center.  Every seat is a good seat, but I prefer to sit in section four (center stage :).  The drinks are expensive, like any other venue out there, so we just get our drink on before we get to Comerica!

We love us some Mr. Goodcents!  Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly and welcoming.  I am obsessed with the razor-thin onions they put on the sandwiches. Everything is cut fresh and to order.  Unlike Subway, their bread tastes freshly baked and is very soft.  If we have a hankering for a sub, you better believe we'll be heading for this place!

Growing up, my family and I would eat at Manuel's all the time after church.  I have always been a fan of their salsa, and especially their beans.  The beans at a mexican restaurant are the main factor that determines whether or not I will return.  I am somewhat of a bean expert.  Manuel's beans pass muster.  I am also a big fan of their frozen margaritas.  Unlike some other mexican restaurants, you can actually tell that they put tequila in the margarita.  The lime flavor doesn't taste fake.   I worked at Manuel's for a semester in college, and I still enjoy their food and drinks.

I came in today to ship some packages because the post office was a mad house.  It was busy for a kinko's, but I was helped promptly and efficiently.  I get a discount with my company to ship things here, so it is a great alternative to waiting in line at the post office.  I have also used this location to fax and it was fast and simple to do.

Bullshooters is a great place to go to have a little fun.  During the day, there are hard core billiards players that flock there with their specialized equipment, but at night, most people are there to have fun.  There are tons of pool tables, electronic dart boards, and ping pong tables.  the beer selection leaves a lot to be desired, but the crowd is more Bud Light than craft most of the time.

I got the Italian on a smiley roll and the hubby got the Italian on a large sub roll.  He got his with extra meat.  When you ask for extra meat, they give it to you!  It was even too much meat for him!  I love that they put Italian dressing on the subs because it makes them taste so much better.  The ordering process was a little confusing.  It looked like one register was for ordering meats to take away and the other side was for ordering food, but there were people standing everywhere so it wasn't' clear.  The menu wasn't terribly clear either. A few people came in to pick up footlong subs while we were eating and they looked good!  Villa Deli is the place to get party subs for sure!

What a pleasant surprise!  I had heard about a liquor store with a basement bar a few years ago, but I forgot about it.  My hubby brought it up the other day, so we decided we'd pay Sun Devil a visit.  The selection of beer is fantastic!  We just returned from a trip to Amsterdam, so we were on a huge Belgian beer kick.  We were able to find a few beers from De Haalve Man in Brugges, Belgium which was awesome because we had just toured that brewery the week before.  The tap list in the basement bar is also fantastic.  The bartender let us try whatever we wanted.  I would love to come back for a wind tasting because their wine tasting room is so cute.

I've been to Four Peaks more times than I can count, and I've always loved the food and the beer.  The past few times I've been, however, have been even better than in years past.  I absolutely LOVE the fact that they brewed a Beligian golden ale!  Idle hands is a fantastic iteration of a Belgian and I think it needs to be a staple here.  They have also added some new menu items including chicken lettuce wraps.  Man, are they spicy, but they have amazing flavor, crunch and texture.  I've always love the beer bread with either beef or chicken and I want the recipe for their pasta salad!  Thanks for having bike racks out front!

We love love love this pizza!  I'm not usually a fan of thin crust pizza, but the sauce they use makes this pie absolutely delicious!  The sauce is quite sweet and makes for a taste that I've never had with any other pie.  They have jars available to purchase of their popular sauces, so I think I'll come back and stock up!  There is a handy take-out and pick up window as you enter.

Yummmmm... Pad Thai!  You can smell that this food will be good before you even enter the restaurant.  We took our order to go and it was all I could do to not rip the bag open and start eating in the car!  We ordered the chicken skewers with a rich, thick yummy peanut sauce and pot stickers.  The Pad Tahi had a lot of green onion and big chunks of chicken in it.  Great food.  Order it to go and hop on over for a beer next door.  They'll bring it over to you!

I love this venue for just about any event.  It has a much more intimate feel than the behemoth US Airways Center.  No matter where you sit in Jobing, you will have a great view.  We've sat down low, and we've sat in the nosebleeds, and the view and the sound are always high quality.  Coyotes games are great here.  They practically make those games into dance parties.  Every break in action they blast a song that I can't help but dance in my seat to.  We usually try to park farther away from the venue so we don't have to pay for parking.  There are tons of restaurants around to catch a drink or food if you don't want to pay the sky high concession prices inside the arena.

Chase Field is a great place to catch a DBacks game.  Almost every seat has a great view, as all the seats are slanted toward home plate.  I do have a problem with the food prices, mainly the crazy overpriced beer, but I know it's a LOT more expensive at other ballparks, so I accept it.  I do like that you can bring in your own water bottles and peanuts and stuff.  Go Diamondbacks!!

I have been to this location one time before and the experience was not memorable, so we decided to try it again.  We walked into the bar and at least half the stools were empty, but there were still checks and dirty plates scattered all over.  It took about 10 minutes for that to be cleaned up.  When I received the chicken taco I ordered, the meat wasn't even lukewarm.  I asked for a new taco and got beef instead because I was worried that the chicken was being held at the wrong temperature and I didn't want to chance getting sick.   My hubby's dish was barely hot as well.  The cheese enchilada was also lukewarm.    The server delivering our plates told us to be careful because the plates were hot, but when we touched them, the plates weren't really hot at all.  Eating at this Macayo's was a so-so experience at best.

I have loved this place for as long as I can remember.  I mean, I even gave it it's own nickname: Mongo.  I can always tell when amateurs are in line, because they don't quite know how to smash the meat and other ingredients down to make the largest bowl of noodle goodness as humanly possible.  I know the recipe for my favorite Mongolian sauce by heart and I will drive many miles just to taste those warm noodles.  I know there used to be a few more choices of veggies and things on the line, but after talking to a manager, he told us about their rising food cost which caused them to have to take away some of the things that were previously offered.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep costs under control.

I would have given this place one star, but the free cookie deserved an extra star.  The snickerdoodles are chewy and delicious.  As for the rest of the food, it was not worth the money or the calories.  We saw this place on an old episode of DDD and decided it was time we try it.  They make it look A LOT better on tv than it is in real life.  Two couples walked in after us and they both received food ten minutes before we received ours.  I guess a quesadilla takes ten minutes to cook??  Try other DDD places, NOT this one.

My husband has been asking to eat at Bobby Q since we moved into our house in the north valley about 8 months ago.  We finally got around to it on his birthday last week.  On first entering, I felt like I was in a BBQ joint in Austin, TX.  The atmosphere was so Texan and down-home I might as well have been in Austin.  I ordered the special drink of the day, an adult Arnold Palmer.  One word:  AMAZING.  The lemonade they used really put it over the top.  So fresh and tart!  Everyone at our table was pleased with the abundance of meat and side items they received.  The icing on the cake was definitely the freshly fried mini cinnamon and sugar donuts they give you before you leave.  It's little touches like that that will beckon us to eat here again and again.

I've heard a lot about Mac's, but we'd never gone for some strange reason.  Whenever I shop at Trader Joe's I remind myself that we need to try it.  We finally did, and we were pleasantly surprised.  Mac's is a delightful neighborhood bar and restaurant.  We were pleased with the craft beer selections and the happy hour drink prices.  We sat at the bar and got great quick service.  My hubby and I ordered the BBQ sandwich and the steak sandwich and shared.  The BBQ sandwich was full of different textures.  It had huge pickeles and cole slaw on it, which I love in a pulled pork sandwich.  We both thought the steak sandwich would have thin strips, but it came with hearty, soft like butter chunks of steak.  It was so tender and juicy.  My hubby loved the thick cut fries.  We will be back.  It might even be our new neighborhood hangout.

I had been bugging my husband about coming to this place for months, when he finally agreed to the idea.  We had eaten pasties in England before and he was not a fan, so he didn't know what to expect.  This place totally changed his opinions about pasties.  The beer selection was pretty good, but my husband ordered beer in a bottle that the menu stated cost $6.50.  When the check came, it cost $10.  The menu should probably be updated to reflect current pricing.    We ordered an Italian and a BBQ chicken pasty.  The expeditor brought out our pasties and we just started eating.  We realized that one of the pasties he brought out was not what we ordered.  It turns out he gave us the wrong order.  They all look the same on the outside, so how were we to know?  He apologized and they gave us the one we actually ordered to -go for free, which I thought was a really nice gesture.   It was also really cool to be able to watch them make the pasties right in front of us while sitting at one of the bars.

I love this store for funky, AZ themed items.  Hubby and I bought a cool Phoenix collage poster for our wall there during a First Friday art walk a few months ago.  I love the wooden AZ home signs so much and I tried to buy one for a family member for Christmas, but they were out.  Bring more in from that artist!  Their stuff is adorable!

My hubby and I love Yard House for happy hour.  Any other time of day?  Not so much.  The beer is highly overpriced if it is not happy hour, as are the entrees.  We love the chicken nachos ( they spread red and green enchilada sauce on them) and the spicy tuna roll which is huge and is chock full o' avocado and chunks of tuna.  yum!  The beer selection is good, but there really won't be anything that makes you go too far out of your craft beer comfort zone here.

Maybe we ordered easy to prepare food items, but our food came faster at this location than it has at any other Oregano's location.  They have a small bar on the patio outside that is always a good option when the one inside is full.  My hubby and I shared the calamari (love the marinara sauce on the side) and the large Pablo Picasso Mexico salad.  Do yourself a favor and add extra saut√©ed onions on top.  It adds that little extra crunch and flavor.  It is by far big enough for two to share.

I was pleasantly surprised to find this amazing wine bar in an unassuming strip mall along Scottsdale road.  We initially sat at the bar where we were promptly greeted with a friendly hello and glasses of water.  We each ordered one of the featured $6 wines for the day.  I drank a Cab and my husband a Merlot.  We moved over to one of the large sectional couches to enjoy our wine and watch the end of the DBacks game on the TV.  They also had a few good beers on tap as well as a refrigerator full of other beer options and wine.  You can choose a bottle of wine or beer and drink it there if you'd rather have that then the featured wines of the day.  They have wine tasting every Thursday, so we plan to try that sometime.

This place seems like it would be phenomenal for breakfast, but the lunch we tried was good, nonetheless.  My hubby ordered the Pavo sandwich with a side of potato salad.  He is a potato salad connoisseur, so him saying that it was amazing at AZ Bread Co is a big deal.  I had a half chicken sandwich with green chilies. The chicken was incredibly thick and juicy.  I had the cheesy tortilla soup with it.  It was a little too fake nacho cheese flavored for me.  I would have liked it more if it had tasted more like natural and not processed cheese.  I would most definitely try this place for breakfast because the burritos look delicious in pictures.

This is an easy drive from our house and it's quick to grab dinner here when we don't have anything to eat at home.  I love the taste of the refried beans and the green and red salsas (although they are a little spicy!)  You get a lot of food for the money.  They also have aguas frescas here FYI.

I went to Albertson's today because I wanted to mix it up a bit.  When I walked in and saw the prices, I remembered why I never shop there.  This grocery store is one of the most expensive out there.  It has Sprouts prices but the same old regular grocery store products.  The produce and meat are just as good quality as Fry's or Safeway, so there is no advantage there.

For the price point of the beer and quality of food, this place is totally 4 star.  The beer was so cheap compared to what we are used to in the northwest valley.  I swear the Northwest valley restaurants serve beer with gold dust in it because they charge an arm and a leg for it.  Not this place though.  Great selection and great price.  We had a pizza too that was quite tasty.

The tortillas at Carolina's are legendary.  Everyone in AZ knows that.  I am a bean expert and I think Carolina's has some amazing beans; not too salty and not too bacon-y flavored.  The one problem I have with Carolina's is the use of SO MUCH packaging!!  They use Styrofoam everything which is horrible for the environment and also horrible to put hot food in because the chemicals leach into the food.  Each item is wrapped in multiple layers of paper and I feel like we can fill a landfill with just the trash from a meal from two people.  They have got to put some recycle bins in here and change their packaging.  Would it be so hard to put combination meals on washable plates?

We were amazed at how busy this place was on a random weeknight!  I called to place an order and could hear how chaotic and loud it sounded in the background.  When we came to pick up the order, every table was full and there was a line of people waiting to pick up their food.    We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein, pork egg rolls, orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  You have the option of two different sizes of each item wen ordering.  The small sizes are plenty big and we had so much leftover food.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken were both really crispy and the lo mein was loaded with chicken and veggies.  I wish they delivered, but since they don't, I guess I will have to brave the crowds because it's the best Asian food I've had in a very long time.

My husband and I came to Dave and Buster's for a date night on a Friday.  I anticipated the place being full of obnoxious kids running around like chickens with their heads cut off, but luckily, that was not the case.  We got a card and loaded it with $20, got a couple of beers (only one local beer on tap-Kiltlifter) and proceeded to play the night away.  I am a total trivia buff so I loved playing the trivia game (and beating everyone who sat down at the game with me.)  I also loved the ski ball game and the basketball game.  We played a couple of games of air hockey too.  We especially loved that a girl that worked there kept coming around and giving us tokens to play a coin game where you can win a lot of tickets.  We called her "The Coin Fairy."  She visited us a couple of times and gifted us with tokens, which made my husband very happy.

I LOVE this place, but I have to be in a patient mood to eat there.  The lines  are always so incredibly long, but that's just a testament to its tastiness.  I usually get the salmon, which comes with multiple sides.  The piece of salmon is so large and there are so many sides that I can never eat more than half of the meal.  The burgers here are amazing, and who can deny the amazingness of the BBQ?  It's the same stuff as Joe's Real BBQ, so if the line at one place is too long, go to the other one!   I love the air powered condiment dispensers and apparently the bathroom d√©cor has been listed in top ten restaurant bathroom lists before. (If the d√©cor of the bathroom at a restaurant is actually important to you!)  Come at off-peak hours for fast service and ample eating space.

I love this little coffee shop next to Joe's Farm Grill.  They have a nice patio that is dog friendly and can accommodate a lot of people.  They have different sandwiches and breakfast items than Joe's Farm Grill and the quality is right on par with JFG.  I had a delicious breakfast burrito there once.  I love the creaminess of their lattes and they don't over sweeten them.  Take a stroll through the community garden after your meal for an all around great experience.

My hubby and I really love trying new beers here.  The list is always quite extensive and the employees are always really knowledgeable about the draft offerings.  The food is the type of bar food that you would expect.  It's pretty good, but I always feel a tiny bit less satisfied than I should compared to the cost of the meal.

This boutique is inside a coffee shop, so it smells great while you're browsing!  They have a ton of really cute clothes.  In fact, it was so packed when I stopped in, it was hard to stay as long as I wanted because it was hard to move in those little hallways they've created with the clothing racks.  They had some really cute AZ themed stuff and jewelry in the front and I want to go back to look more closely at the clothing.  It was hard to find parking for this place.

The best way I can describe the taste of these subs is to say that they are like a more expensive Subway.  Twenty bucks for two subs, 2 chips and one drink.  Subway would have been cheaper and tasted the same.  There was an ample amount of meat and the bread was soft, but my sub was very salty and I think they forgot the vinegar, oil, and seasonings that were supposed to come on it.

Ever since my hubby and I moved to Tempe from the northwest valley, we've been looking for a place to feed our sushi craving.  Unfortunately, SakeBomber will not be our new go-to.  We sat at the sushi bar and our order was taken.  After we got our beers, we didn't see the server until after we had finished all of our rolls.  The sushi chef just handed us our rolls so the server never had to come over to give us what we had ordered.  I was looking for the server so we could order more drinks and she was nowhere to be found.  I couldn't even flag down any other servers because they all whizzed by so fast that I couldn't get their attention. It was a little weird that they had to give us a wristband so we could drink.  I felt like I was at a waterpark or something. My husband and I were not impressed with the freshness of the sushi or the flavor of the specialty rolls.  The spicy tuna had virtually no flavor and no spice.

My opinion of SanTan has been steadily improving with each experience.  A couple of visits a few years ago left me longing for better food and a more varied beer selection.  After more recent visits, SanTan has stepped up it's game.  I think the food has improved year over year (try the nachos, they're piled high) and they keep introducing more and more great beers.  My hubby is obsessed with Heavy D.  At 60 IBU's, it's a very drinkable DIPA, even for a girl with low IBU tolerance.  I love the atmosphere when the garage doors are open and a breeze is blowing through.

I have heard a lot about this event, but it took years for me to actually attend.  Too bad, because I would probably have a house full of amazing art by now!  I loved the huge selection of arts, crafts, jewelry, and entertainment at this festival.  Since well behaved dogs are allowed, of course our doggie Bailey tagged along.  We are looking forward to the next Tempe Arts Fest!

We just moved south, so this is the closest Whole Foods to us now.  Thank goodness it has a bar!!  I am totally bummed that the beers are not regularly updated on TapHunter though.  That needs to change!  The beer selection on tap and in the refrigerated cases are fantastic.  You can always count on a beer that you have never heard of before to be on tap.  The bar-b-que food at the smokehouse grill leaves a lot to be desired.  I do really love the burrito bowls at the Mexican place though.

This review is for the dog park only.  This park is huge!  The grass was freshly cut and it was free of dog poop landmines, which means people pick up after their dogs here.  There was plenty of space for us to get away from the big dogs that my little dog is not fond of and have our own area to throw the ball for her.

Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the amazing playlist blasting through the speakers.  Yes, it was pretty loud, but when you've got MC Hammer jamming, loud is totally cool with me.  Do these Millennials even know who MC Hammer is?  Probably not.  The atmosphere is great, but the coffee is even better.  My hubby got one of those slow drip coffee things where it eliminates all the bitterness and really brings out the flavors of the beans.  He was a big fan of his.  I was loving my dirty iced chai.  This is one of those places that helps make Tempe as cool as it is.

A grocery store with a bar in it?  Sold! $4 for any pint all day Saturday?  Sold!  We stopped by for a few drinks after dinner in Scottsdale.  I absolutely LOVE their craft beer selection.  It rivals a lot of the top bars in AZ.  We grabbed our pints, then I went to scope out the pastries and desserts.  Anywhere I can grab a delicious dessert with my craft pint, I will love forever.  Don't just shop here, drink here!

We have tried other sushi places in our area, and nothing even comes close to Yen.  The happy hour is one of the best, but it's only for two hours in the afternoon (3-5pm) so it's hard for us to get to sometimes.  Never fear though, they also have happy hour from 8pm- close.  A large beer and sake is $5 and they have about 5 $5 rolls.  Most of the cheap rolls are fried, but if that's what you like, you are in luck.    We always order the heart attack roll, which is a California roll topped with jalape√±os, tomato, avocado, and big chunks of succulent tuna.  It's also covered in masago and a spicy sauce that brings everything together.  We can't get enough of this roll.  We also order the Sunset roll a lot, which is topped with salmon and lemon, which makes the roll very refreshing and tangy.  The service is always good, and the tiny place is usually packed, so put on your patient hat and wait for a table!

So I let it slide when you took the California turkey sandwich off the menu, but this time, I just can't overlook it.  My hubby and I were craving Paradise last night, so I went in to place a to-go order.  I ordered the BBQ chicken salad for my hubby.  The girl tells me it is no longer on the menu.  "You mean you still have the ingredients for it but it isn't on the menu anymore?"  I asked.  Nope... you can't order it at all, she tells me.  It is banished from the menu.  My heart stopped for a minute.  My hubby LOVES that salad.  In his words, it is his "soul mate salad."  I can't even get him to eat a salad unless it is the BBQ chicken at Paradise.  It's gone!  How the heck am I ever going to get him to eat a salad again??  So I tell the girl that I have to go to the car to tell this unspeakable fact to my husband.  He was not happy!  He said we will never be coming back to Paradise ever again.  You have lost two very loyal customers because you can't seem to keep the same thing on the menu for any extended amount of time.  Does Paradise not understand that it is not a sustainable business model to change your menu every few months?  It gets really annoying when you find something you like, and the next time you stop in, nothing on the menu even resembles that item.    Not only that, but the menu above the counter no longer has any descriptions of menu items.  What the heck is the Frontega Chicken sandwich?  I wouldn't know because the descriptions that used to be there are gone.  I shouldn't have to ask what every single sandwich consists of before I place my order.    Venting session over.  Someone needs to go back to the drawing board at Paradise Bakery and fix what's broken.

This Bevmo seems  a little smaller than some of the others, but they still manage to have a decent selection of craft beers.  I like that they have a growler station that has a good variety of brews.  Growler fills are quite affordable as well.

Ahhhhhh...organizational heaven.  They have pretty much everything you can think of.  Although, they didn't have individual plastic banana holders I was looking for, so maybe they should add that to their inventory ;)  Everyone working there is willing to help, so don't be afraid to ask.

We finally tried this place because my brother in law and sister in law kept telling us how much they love it.  It is a small little house with a patio out front, which was perfect for the great weather the other day.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada taco.  I am a self described burrito expert, and this burrito was a winner.  The tortilla was soft and flavorful, and the beans, which are not made with lard, were nicely mixed with cheese.  The taco was very good as well.   Like a good yelper, I checked in to this place when I got there.  There is a check-in offer for free chips and salsa.  When I showed it to the employee, she said I had to print it out in order to get the deal.  I told her that you can't print check-in offers; that they are meant to be used on your mobile device.  She pretty much told me that she wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the manager has not told anyone who works there about the check-in offer and how to use it, because she acted like I was a jerk for even asking about it.  She ended up giving us the free chips and salsa, but I could tell she thought she may get in trouble for giving it to me.  That manager should probably explain the check in offer so this doesn't keep happening.  Aside from that situation, the food was great, and I would definitely go back for more of those yummy beans!

Wow!  What a fantastic experience at the Bliss Spa.  I was worried about parking, but when I pulled up into the driveway of the W Hotel, the valet came straight up to welcome me and parked my car.  The spa will validate parking so don't be afraid to valet!    Make sure you show up early so you can get settled in your robe and enjoy the complimentary cheese and crackers, delicious brownies, and hot tea in the sitting area.    I received a facial and the esthetician was amazing!  She addressed my skin's needs and told me how I can continue to take care of it after the treatment.  She loaded me up with scrubs, moisturizers, and serums and they all smelled so fresh and clean.  She also gave me an amazing leg/foot and arm/hand massage.    After that, I got the milk and almond pedicure.  My feet felt so pampered at the end of it.  My nails were painted flawlessly.  I've never had someone paint them so cleanly.    They have steam showers in the locker room loaded with shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and face wash.  Try the lemon sage conditioner.  You'll thank me later.    It was an immensely relaxing experience and I would recommend this place to everyone!

These little cakes are like angels dancing on my tongue!  The frosting is not too sweet and it's very smooth and creamy.  The cake is incredibly moist and delicious.  I've only gotten bundtlets there, but great things can come in small packages!  I love the variety of flavors they offer as well.

I ordered the Southwest burrito and it was chock full o' chorizo, but it seemed to be lacking the jalape√±o cream cheese that was supposed to be in it.  My hubby got the meat omelet and he really liked it because it really was full of meat.   I am a fresh squeezed OJ snob, and theirs was very tasty and cold.  I like the set-up, where you order at the counter and they bring the food to you.  It was fast and efficient.  I would definitely try this place again.  It beats most of the breakfast joints in our area, so it'd be worth a drive here.

It's a scorcher to sit in the sun at this ballpark, and there are definitely plenty of sunny spots.  The overhangs here are smaller than other fields so there is less shade to go around.  This causes a lot of people to hang out behind the seats behind home plate.  It becomes very crowded in that area.    When we saw the Cubs/White Sox play the other day, they were directing traffic into the parking areas and making everyone enter from the back of the field, so once you parked, there was a long trek ahead of you to get to the entrance of the stadium.  Last year, the parking situation was faster and easier.  Please go back to your old ways.  We were stuck in more than an hour long line just to park once we exited the 101 on Camelback.  There has got to be a better way!  I was worried about how expensive a beer would be there when I saw a vendor selling tiny little Bud Lights for $7.50.  I was relieved when I found a beer tent selling large craft beer for only $8.50!  That's at least $3 cheaper than all other Spring Training facilities.

This little coffee shop is one of the few things that stands in downtown Gilbert to remind everyone of what that street used to be like.  It's small, quaint, and cute.  It's a little oasis among the new modern restaurants and buildings in downtown Gilbert.  My hubby and I rode our bikes there.  There wasn't any designated bike parking or lock-ups, but we just brought our bikes into the garden and leaned them up against a tree, which worked out well.  My hubby had the dark roast of the day, and I had a latte.  The latte was delicious and creamy.  It had a ton of foam, but luckily what was there to drink was delicious.  They have musicians play in the garden on certain nights.  It would be a great place to meet friends to sit in the cute little garden, talk, and enjoy the winter weather.

As 24 Hour Fitness gyms go, this one is one of the nicer locations.  Most of the time, the treadmill I choose to use works, but there is obviously no preventative maintenance done on their machines.  Some of the treadmills don't increase or decrease in speed quickly because the buttons don't work well, so it's impossible to do interval training.  The weight machines are always clean and in good repair, and the number of juicers that hog the machines is minimal.  It's not the nicest gym ever, but if you compare it to other 24 hour fitness locations, it's definitely one of the nicer ones.

When I average out all the aspects of Gallo Blanco, I reach a four star rating.  The food and happy hour are the two reasons we keep coming back.  The service is not a reason to return, but we put up with it to eat those yummy little tacos.  This place is just off the lobby of the Clarendon Hotel, which is hipster central.   No one wears a nametag or any identifiable mark of actually working there so it's hard to flag someone down if you need something.  A few servers act like you are inconveniencing them for being there.  We put up with all that because the happy hour prices are great and the pork tacos and carne asada burrito are to die for!  We also love the green and red salsa (you can find the same stuff at Crescent Ballroom).  The white sangria and margaritas are just right on a warm day.

I love the food at this place, especially when it is on happy hour prices.  The pizzas are fantastic and the fritto misto are crispy and not oily.  The beer selection is pretty good and the specialty cocktails look very inventive.  Judging by how much the lady next to me at the bar was raving about her cocktail, they must taste really good too.  The only qualm I have with this place is the service.  It's very slow and I can't remember any time when the server or bartender came back soon after we got our food to ask if we needed anything else.  Once they give you your food, the service is very hands off.  If the service was more attentive, they would easily earn 5 stars.

Maybe my dog is a dog park snob, but this just isn't her favorite.  There is so much dirt and dust that she needs a bath every time we let her play for a few minutes.  The small dog area on the west side gets really cramped when more than a few dogs are there.

We went to Rustic Cafe today for breakfast because we saw that it had a 4 star rating.  Normally, yelpers are right in their assessments of restaurants.  This, hoewever, was not the case.  My hubby and I both got omelettes.  They were both filled with stuff, but quite greasy.  The hasbrowns on my hubby's plate were cold.  We were both frankly quite underwhelmed by this place.  The price point was good.  I am a stickler for tasty OJ at a breakfast place, thus I am taking a star away for the sole reason that the OJ was obviously from concentrate.  I don't even drink OJ from concentrate at home.  Why would I pay $3 for it?

What's not to like?  The beers are prominently displayed on two large TV screens that are easy to read.  There is ample comfortable seating.  You can bring in take-out and enjoy it with your hard to find brew in a friendly, low key environment.  They also have coolers full of bottles to choose from.  Unlike some places, they make sure to have many styles of beer represented.  They don't overload on IPA's like I've been noticing at other beer establishments.  Thanks for thinking of all beer lovers, not just IPA fans!

Sleepy Dog is a really cozy neighborhood tasting room.  You can have food delivered here, or you can walk next door and pick up food to bring in.  My hubby and I were using a Groupon deal for our first visit so we each ordered a flight of 6, 4oz tasters.  We got to choose whatever brews we wanted.  We were really impressed with the beer here,. especially considering the fact that we very rarely ever see any of their beers on tap in bars around the valley.  We will absolutely be back to hang out and chill.

This Fili B's location is really new and very clean.  We stopped in on Taco Tuesday, obviously a very popular night because most of the tables in the restaurant were full.  You can't beat a $.99 taco!  I love their bean burritos because the tortillas are nice and soft and the beans are runny and delicious.  I love the choices of salsa on the salsa bar.  On taco Tuesday, my hubby and I ate for only $10, so that's pretty awesome.

This is another restaurant we are adding to the list of places that we will only visit for happy hour.  My hubby and I ordered a greek salad to split and created our own pizza.  We got four toppings on it.  The beer selection is good, but each beer is $7!!  Once again, there must be gold dust in the beers served in the Northwest valley because $7 for a  beer is outrageous.  The pizza was pretty good, but when the bill came, we noticed that each vegetable topping was 1.29 a piece and each meat topping was 2.29 a piece.  For 1.29 worth of onions, we should have had 1/2 of an onion on that pizza.  Instead, I could barely find any onion.  They were beyond stingy with the toppings!  You're making me pay a ton per topping and I can barely see that it's on the pizza.  Not a fan of that at all!  We will not be returning unless it's happy hour and we will never order a pizza there again because it was way overpriced for the measly toppings they put on it.

This dog park is as good as it gets.  It's built on an old landfill, but you'd never have any idea because it is such a well kept and manicured dog park/Frisbee golf range/children's play area.  When we lived nearby, my dog would be so excited when we turned up the driveway to the dog park.  There are two separate areas to the dog park and each side is closed periodically for clean up and to let the grass regenerate.  This allows each side of the park to always be clean and the grass to be green and lush.  We've been to the other dog park in Chandler that has a beach entry lake for dogs, and that's cool and all, but it's not nearly as well kept as Paseo Vista.

We were hungry after leaving a concert at 11pm, and we happened to find this little gem on our way home for a late night bite.  Main Ingredient looks like a converted house, so it's very small on the inside, but there is a large patio out front with fairy lights and tons of ambiance to accommodate larger groups.  They only have about 10 craft beers on tap, but all of them were from different brewers and there was a wide range of styles.  I ordered an Odell Amber that was amazing and my hubby got a Ballast Point IPA.  We ordered the Cochinita tacos which comes with two tacos and a cup of beans, and the cheesesteak with salad.  The meat in the tacos was super juicy and had just the right touch of spice.  They didn't skimp on the amount of meat in the tacos either.  The cheesesteak was chock full o' peppers and meat and my hubby would not stop raving about it.  The entire menu looked drool-worthy so we are planning to go back for lunch to try something else.

La Santisima is on the top of my list for tacos in AZ.  It's not in the best part of town and the parking situation is a little tough if it's busy, but the food is out of this world!  My hubby and I came once, and decided to bring my parents here for an early Mother's Day lunch.    I go weak in the knees for restaurants with salsa bars, but this place has a salsa bar on steroids.  They cater to all tastes and all heat levels.  I am in love with at least 5 of their salsas, including the pico de gallo that is so lime-y and delicious that it's the first one that ran out during both of our lunch visits.    My hubby ordered the Norteno burrito both times and I got a variety of street tacos.  The carne asada is soft and juicy and not the least bit tough like you'll find at most Mexican places.  The beans remind me of the ones that my BFF's mom makes in Nogales.  Delicious!!

My husband always said that Hooters had the best wings.  He was feeling some wings one night, so we ventured to Hooters.  And no, he did not want to go to Hooters because of the scantilly clad boob-showing servers. His wife's boobs are sooo much better!  He ordered the wings and was not thrilled.  I'm pretty sure that he loved the wings so much because he used to eat them after all the beer he drank dulled his senses.  With only one beer under his belt before eating the wings, they were quite lackluster.  The service was terrible as well.  We waited entirely too long for wings and a burger.  The server was too busy fake-flirting with 2 guys that would never stand a chance with her.  We will not be back.

After making some repairs to our pool, we started up the pool vacuum and it didn't seem to work.  We made our way to Leslie's because we have had great service from them in the past.   The guy working that day was incredibly knowledgeable.   He told us what he thought the problem might be and told us if we brought in our pool vac, he would take it apart for us for free and only charge us for parts if anything needed to be replaced.  We brought the vacuum back to the store where he disassembled the vacuum in front of us and showed us that it was still in good working order.  His suggestion for a new o-ring for the pump seemed to fix all the problems when we put it on when we got back home.    We always bring our pool water in for a free chemical analysis which helps us keep our pool looking brilliant.   The service at Leslie's is always amazing.  Be patient though, because there are usually only one or two people working at a time, so it may take a few minutes for someone to be free to help you.

This place was packed even for an early Thursday dinner.  You can tell that this restaurant is a beloved local establishment.  The ambiance is authentic and relaxed...perfect place to enjoy a tasty sangria!  Hubby and I split a three item meal with unlimited bread and salad.  If you split a meal, they charge you $3, but it was well worth it because of the amazing salad and bread.  Forget those chain restaurants that claim they know how to cook Italian food.  Try Rigatony's instead!

The run was really well organized.  We placed ourselves in the wrong starting stall because we had never run the race before.  We finished much faster than those in our stall, but we know where to place ourselves next year.  The finish line is amazing and there were ample drinks/fruit for all the finishers.  We took the advice on the website and rode the light rail to the race, but we wish we would have known to buy light rail tickets in advance.  The line was a bout 100 people long when we got to the station.  I think they should include in the suggestions for people to buy their light rail ticket in advance.  We almost got there late due to waiting in line for a ticket!  Some of the course also seemed a little too skinny for all the people running.  It was hard to keep a steady pace when I constantly had to maneuver around slower runners.

I used to think Pork on a Fork was one of the best BBQ joints around.  Our last two visits have disproved this theory.  We used a Groupon here a week ago and it was not tasty like it used to be.  I had a bone in my pulled pork sandwich that was about the size of a quarter and could have broken one of my teeth in two.  I realize that there is always the possibility of bone in BBQ, but this piece was so large they should have caught it.  The meat really didn't have any flavor without the sauce.  My husband was not thrilled by the lukewarm beer he was given or the brisket.  The amount of flies in the dining area was disgusting!

I really like Wildflower Bread Company, especially for breakfast.  Their pancakes are to die for.  I also really love their salads.  Their sandwiches always seem a little to high priced for what you get, but they always taste really good.  I stopped in to this place with my friend and her two small kids, and a busser got us a high chair and wiped down our table for us, which was very nice.

Do that many people buy donuts?  Every time I'm in a Bosa location, no one is in there, yet they keep opening up a ton of new locations and the Southern location stays open 24 hours.  I didn't know the donut biz was booming so much!  Nonetheless, If I'm going to buy donuts in AZ, I'm probably going to go to Bosa.  The selection is huge and the pink sprinkle donuts are awesome.  They also have an assortment of boba tea and other drinks that I have yet to try.  They sure look good though!

What?  I thought for sure I had already written a review on this place!  Ever since we moved out of Chandler, my hubby and I reminisce about their happy hour and their ICE COLD beers.  I'm not exaggerating here.  The beer is poured into a frozen glass and there is usually ice floating on the top of the beer when the server brings it to the table.  If I sung a song like Maria Von Trapp, I'd have frozen glasses and ice cold beer as a few of my favorite things.  I swear they have the coldest beer in the valley.   We love munching on peanuts before our meals arrive and looking at the adorable pictures of dogs on the walls all around us.  We usually order the nachos, which are served on a huge platter.  They are not traditional nachos, as they are about 10 large chips loaded with fixings instead of a huge pile of chips.  They are much easier to eat than regular nachos.  The sliders are great too.    If you are leaving the Paseo Vista dog park nearby and are craving an ice cold local brew, stop in to Bear's and find a spot on the patio!

This place is a craft beer lover's paradise!  The selection is forever changing and it's always interesting to see what they'll have next.  The night we were there, the rep for New Belgium was there and gave us some sweet goblets for trying one of their beers on tap (which turned out to be a great easy drinking summer beer).   The food is better than most bars, but we didn't come here with food at the forefront of our minds.  It's all about the beer!  Trivia nights here are super fun as well.

I was impressed by the extreme creaminess of the latte I ordered here.  The barista made a nice little design in the foam and filled the cup to the very top.  They have 6 or more choices for slow roasted coffee but 2 options if you just want a quick cup.  My hubby got a quick cup of the Rwandan coffee they had that day and really enjoyed it.  It seems like a great place to sit and read or work and there are multiple tables outside in the shade to lounge and enjoy your cuppa joe.

This is a new favorite place for my husband and I.  We were craving some coffee one day and were feeling nostalgic about the drive through coffee joints in Portland, OR when we drove past 32 Shea.  My hubby ordered an Americano and he loved it.  I had an iced chai that was creamy and delicious.   A second time, we stopped here for a quick breakfast.  We both had the breakfast burritos that come with little cups of homemade salsa.  The salsa is so flavorful, and really enhances the flavor of the burrito.  It causes a serious case of heartburn later in the day though, so be ready with the tums!!  I would chance a little heartburn for another cup of salsa!

We saw Randy Rogers band here on Friday night.  It's a 50 mile drive for us, so we were glad that the venue was so huge and entertaining.  They don't open the stage area until a few minutes before the show, which is absolute genius because I hate standing there forever trying to keep your spot in the front.  That way, everyone could dance and drink and take a seat and enjoy life instead of worrying about their spot near the stage.  The beer selection is pretty pitiful.  When I asked what beers they had that weren't like the color of urine, she said they had shock top and fat tire.  The rest were Bud Light caliber.  Bleh.   I guess cowboys wouldn't know craft beer if it rode in on a horse.   I'll put up with crappy beer for a sweet RRB concert though!!

I've been wanting to try Tacos Atoyac forever but we were just never nearby.  We stopped in the other day for lunch and, judging by the long line and the numerous construction crews and firefighters eating there, we could tell it would be good.  We ordered tacos (camaron, al pastor, pescado) and I ordered a bean burrito as well.  I have to say that the bean burrito was one of the best I have ever had in my life.  I don't know what they use in their tortillas but they are perfectly translucent and chewy.  The three salsas that came with the meal were out of this world.  None of them were very spicy, but I loved the variety and the smokiness of them.  I also loved that you could get a side of grilled jalapenos and onions.  Don't judge a restaurant by its exterior.  This place may look a little rough from the outside, but inside, it's taco heaven!

My hubby and I stopped in here before the Diamondback's Social Media Night.  We arrived at 3pm, just in time for happy hour (not planned, but a welcome treat.)  My hubby ordered a Kiltlifter on tap (his go-to beer when it's the only good craft beer on tap) and I ordered a drink called "The Fix."  It was a mixture of limeade with a dash of raspberry compote on top.  The glass was full, and I mean full, of ice, but it was ok, because it was the good kind of ice.  You know, the kind that comes in little, easy to bite apart balls.  Mix in the fruit compote, and the drink went from a little sour, to delightfully sweet and lemonade-y.  We ordered the Jambalaya and the burger and we split each item.  The burger was juicy and the saut√©ed onions on top were so flavorful.  The Jambalaya was full of chicken, shrimp and Andouille sausage, but I took a bite and got a monster chicken bone in my mouth.  Not enjoyable.  We had to signal the bartender for her to come over because she never just checked on us to see how we were doing.  If we lived closer to this place, it would be a happy hour that we would frequent.

Every seat is a good seat, including those in the grass.  The beer selection has improved over last year because they now have both Colorado and Arizona local brews.  Now if they could get more of those on tap, it would be even better!  The prices for food are actually quite reasonable for the amount of food you get.  The beers are pricey, but that's normal for a ballpark.  There are two large merch stores that are easily accessed from either side of the field.  This is the only place that I have seen that sells Italian ice, which I have to get every time I am here.  Go DBacks!!

GREAT happy hour til 7 every day.  I always get the red sangria.  The happy hour food is ok, but we prefer to split the goat cheese burger because it is juicy and sooo flavorful.  Service here has always been good, especially while sitting at the bar.  They have a dog patio here as well.  We brought our dog here and they treated her to a huge bone and some water.  She loved it.

It's a shame that I felt the need to update my review after our last visit to BLD.  We used to live close by, so we'd come for happy hour quite often.  I still love the sangria, although I didn't notice it advertised on the menu anymore.  I had to ask the bartender to make sure they still had it.    This time, we ordered the chorizo chili fries.  We had ordered this previously and loved it.  It used to come with a dollop of sour cream, green onions and tomatoes on top.  It now just comes with the chili.  It was super disappointing because it needs that bit of cool creaminess and crunch on top to really make this a dish worth ordering again.    We also ordered the seared ahi tuna, which we had also ordered here previously.  It had about 6 slices of tuna and a blob of hummus with roasted red peppers on top.  The tuna was sitting on a tasty wasabi cream sauce.  When we had ordered this item before, it came with pita chips to eat the hummus with.  This time, there were no pita chips in sight and the bartender told us they didn't have them anymore at all.  What is the point of wasting money by putting hummus on a plate when there is no medium by which to scoop it up?  They might as well lower the food cost of the menu item and delete the hummus all together.  I think if they added a sesame slaw or something on the side, it would go much better and it would actually look like a cohesive dish.    I think the problem with BLD is that they have too extensive of a menu.  If they narrowed it down and concentrated on making fewer items into more stellar dishes, people would be more likely to return.  That's just my hospitality degree talking.

Thinking about Spinato's triggers a Pavlovian response... I immediately start drooling.  The sweetness of their pizza sauce is like none other and the crispness and flavor of the crust can't be beat.  We've only eaten inside this location once because we prefer to get a pizza for takeout, but the salad we had while dining in was also amazing.  If you have a hankering for thin crust, there is no better pizza in the Valley!!

I was introduced to Rita's by my best friend who lived in Hoboken, NJ.  The shop in Hoboken had about 50 flavors of ice, compared to about 10 in PHX, but it's not the phenomenon in AZ as it is in NJ.  I love their vanilla custard and lemonade ice.  My favorite flavor in any frozen concoction is usually strawberry, but not here, because it is far from a fresh strawberry flavor.  Too fake for me!

It should not have taken me this long to sing the praises of Salsa Blanca.  You had me at Salsa Bar.  I seriously LOVE when Mexican food places have salsa bars.  Variety is the spice of life, and I love a little variety in my salsa.  The roasted salsa is more like a normal chunky salsa than roasted, but it still tastes good.  My hubby got a combination special with a bean tostada on the side, and I got a bean and cheese burrito and a beef soft taco.  The beans are really good here, because if they weren't, I'd never be back.  I'm a bean-a-holic.  We both got margaritas that tasted like they were made with fresh squeezed lime juice.  All that for only 25 bucks!  You can't beat that killer deal!  The people who work here are very friendly and they are also quick at clearing used plates.

One word: YUM!  The burgers are juicy and delicious.  The restaurant is quite small and was packed when we came in.  The black board behind the register has all the items on the menu written on it, but unless you had been there before, it really doesn't tell you anything.  There are a ton of burgers, sandwiches and even tacos to choose from.  My hubby got a burger with roasted chili and pico de gallo on it, and I got the classic cheeseburger with Havarti.  We both loved the flavor and I thought the portion was perfect, but my hungry hubby could have eaten a little bit more.  I loved the use of cucumbers on the burger; it was something I'd never had before.  We also loved the jalapeno ranch dressing that we used to dip our fries into.  Soooo good!

According to the reviews of this place, we were expecting greatness.  Is that what we got?  Not quite, but it was good.  I would highly recommend anything with beans in it.  The beans are by far some of the best I have ever had.  I am a bean connoisseur and believe that beans are one of the "perfect foods" so that means a great deal.  The fish tacos were also outstanding.  I loved the creamy sauce mixed with pico on top of the crispy huge chunks of fish.  The chckien on the chicken taco and the beef in the beef quesadilla were both way overvcooked and tough.  The meat in the tacos al pastor was also overcooked and lacked flavor.

I LOVE the food, music and specialty drinks here.  The only thing that could possibly influence me to take away a star from my review is the fact that the service we have received every time we've eaten here has been terrible.  We had the same server each time.  She told us the wrong drink specials for the day the first time.  The second time she had no idea that half the beers they have were out of stock because they had a busy weekend and hadn't gotten another shipment in.  She acts like she doesn't care about her job or the customers and she disappears frequently for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Maybe if we got another server I'd give this place 5 stars.

My hubby and I came here to hang out with our niece and nephew who absolutely love this place.  They could probably be here all day and be happy.  An hour of jumping is plenty for me, because I am sweating buckets after about 15 minutes of jumping.  Beware, because muscles you didn't know you had anymore will hurt after jumping here for an hour or so.  Even on busy days, there never seems to be too many people jumping at once.  They keep this place very clean, and the wristband system keeps jumping times organized.  My niece had her birthday party here and had a ton of fun.

I was in the area (my old neighborhood) and I had a hankering for subs.  But Freddy's doesn't serve subs, you say.  You would be correct.  I drove to my favorite sub place and it turned out that the power entire shopping center where the sub place was located was out.  So much for feeding that sub craving.   I consulted my trusty yelp ap for another option.  This is where Freddy's enters the picture.  I got the California style burger, which basically means it has their special sauce on it.  They grill their burgers really flat at the edges which makes the edges sort of crispy and charred.  It actually added flavor, but I can see how some people wouldn't be a fan of that.   It wouldn't be a meal if it didn't end with dessert, so I ordered a mini vanilla custard with cookie dough on top.  The vanilla custard was so creamy and delicious and you could tell that the cookie dough was top quality (and trust me, I know my quality cookie dough!)  I would absolutely go back, especially for a sweet treat fix!

What I really like about Pita Jungle is that the veggies in the food are always so fresh.  I had a salmon salad today that had cucumbers, tomatoes, red bell peppers and was topped with their delicious lemon dressing that makes the salad taste so fresh and bright.  We also got a large order of the cilantro jalapeno hummus that I could sit and eat with a spoon it is so dang good.  I absolutely love their fresh squeezed lemonade.  They have about 6 taps for beer and all but one of them (Bud Light...ewww)  looked like it was a rotating tap that changes when the keg blows.   The have fantastic gyros that are actually very well priced.  If you are in the mood for some medditteranean appetizers, come during happy hour.

We love this place!  The bagels are so soft, even after they are toasted.  We usually get the egg, bacon and cheese on onion or jalapeno and they are delicious.  The service is always prompt and the guy that is always at the counter (I'm assuming he is the owner) knows tons of people that come in by name and he is always friendly.  I've been to other bagel places at 10am on a Saturday, and they are all out of the good bagels for the day.  That never happens at The Bagel Man.  They have a good selection throughout the day and replace flavors as they run out.

My hubby and I are a little bummed that we didn't discover this place a little sooner.  I absolutely love their Gyro and salad combo and they are always generous with the Yelp check-in offer.  The gyro has so much meat in it that I half to take out about 1/3rd of it to even make it small enough to fit in my mouth.  The people that work there are great and willing to give suggestions.  Zeus would be proud!

This shopping center is right near my house, so it's pretty much our one stop shop for whatever we need.  The parking lot is a little dodgy because the traffic is routed all different directions and sometimes there are not stop signs when there probably should be, but if you keep your eyes open it's fine.

Awesome pizza!  The first time we came, we only had drinks and dessert.  The baked cookie with ice cream is to DIE for!  Soooo good.  The bartender was very friendly and let us try any beer we wanted before we ordered.  The second time, we came for my birthday and had pizza, which was so flavorful and different than any other pizza joints.  We are big fans of this place and hope it succeeds!

Woah!  Dutch Bros employees are wayyyy more happy and upbeat than the average Joe.  It almost made my teeth hurt because they were so sweet.  I'm used to getting a few less pumps of flavor in my lattes because they always taste so syrupy and sweet, but not at Dutch Bros.  All the components come together flawlessly.  My caramel latte didn't taste too sweet, nor too milky.  I loved it!

I walked to Chloe's Corner while on a break from Jury Duty.  I ordered the tuna melt and a bowl of tomato soup.  The sandwich was huge and melty and gooey.  It hit the spot.  The tomato soup was sort of thin, but the flavor was top notch.  The price point was very affordable.  If I worked downtown, I'd be here all the time.  The food was so good, that when I walked back to the courthouse and got released from Jury Duty immediately, I wasn't even angry that they could have released us before lunch.

You had me at "Salsa Bar."  Oh Caramba... all you needed was a salsa bar to get me to come back again and again.  So many salsas to choose from makes this salsa freak so happy!  I love the variety and freshness of all the salsas, as well as the freshness and low prices of the food.   When our order number was called, I had to ask the guy behind the counter if all that food was for my order because there were two trays full!  We spent less than $20 for all that food.  My hubby and I left fat and oh so happy after eating at Caramba's.

I always go to this place when I need gel manicures and pedicures for an upcoming vacation.  This time, the girl doing my nails put on such a thick coat, that after two weeks, I still don't have any cracks or signs of wear on nails.  Amazing!   A lot of the people that work there are very good at nail art and will pretty much paint anything you want on your nails.  This place is always packed and it is evident that it has a ton of regulars.  It's a tad pricey to go to very often, so I will stop by for special occasions only.

Rudy's is great for both breakfast and lunch.  They serve breakfast tacos until 10am everyday, but if you come after that, there will still be some left on the heater.  I love their sides, but their potato salad is some of the best ever.  They also have great banana and chocolate pudding that you can take to go if you fill up on too much BBQ.  The customer service is great, and they will let you sample meats if it's your first time.  They have paper towel rolls at all the tables, but they also have a sink in the dining room to wash your hands in.  I feel like I'm back in Texas when I eat at Rudy's.

We love shopping at Winco.  This store has taken the place of Walmart which makes me happy because Walmart is an evil entity.  I love that they carry Tillamook products like cheese, ice cream and yogurt.  The produce is abundant and in good shape, but there are very few, if any organic options.  The prices are great on things like cereal that is usually 4 bucks a box.  Winco usually has it for $3.  I like that they give me a reusable bag discount for bringing my own bags.  Every store should encourage this type of behavior because plastic bags are so wasteful.  We have never bought their meat or seafood, so I can't speak on that, but everything else we've bought has been good quality at a fair price.

My dog is picky with her treats and this is the perfect place for her!  They have a great assortment of treats and chew sticks.  We got her a "bully stick" made out of beef tendon from here and the man said it would probably take her a few weeks to chew through.  2 days later we came back to buy her an even longer one because she just demolished the first one.  It is her favorite thing to chew!  The employees are always very friendly and helpful.

Drinking a beer in the middle of a grocery store may sound weird, but it makes grocery shopping so much more bearable.  Hubby and I love to get a burrito bowl or a piece of pizza, then walk a few steps to the Watering Hole to grab a beer to wash it down with.  The beer selection is always great, and many times I discover a new beer that I have never tried nor heard of before.

Our night at Uncle Bear's started out pretty well.  We drove like 25 minutes to get to this location because we were craving the nachos and ice cold beer.  The beer was cold and the nachos were tasty.  We ordered dessert and then everything went downhill.  The cookie was cold and rock hard, and the ice cream was so hard it seemed like it had been in the freezer for months.  My husband and I were talking amongst ourselves and the bartender starting talking with us.  Everything was fine until he started saying things that were quite insulting to both my husband and I.  My husband was so annoyed and angry that he didn't even want to tip the guy.  I did, even though he was very rude and made our experience an unpleasant one.  Note to bartenders: don't piss off the patrons because it makes your wallet a whole lot lighter.  We will not be returning to this location purely because of the unpleasant service.

The service was not amazing, but I just don't care.  The food was too outstanding for the service to matter.  And the beer selection... just order your customized tasting tray and you will find out!  My hubby and I are self proclaimed beer snobs, and there were many beers on the menu that a)we had never heard of and b)were super complex and delicious.  Whoever is curating the beer selection is doing a great job.    We ordered two types of tacos ( I forget what they are called on the menu): one fish and the other pulled pork.  They both came with a side of an amazing avocado dip that went perfectly on each type of taco.  The beans that came on the side were so flavorful and smooth.   I may dream about these tacos in the future.   This place seems perfect for after work happy hour.  They have a huge patio and corn hole set-up.

I've lived in AZ most of my life and I have only been to downtown Mesa a handful of times.  When my hubby told me there was a brewery there that intrigued him, I was skeptical.  Who goes to downtown Mesa anyway?  After our experience at Desert Eagle, my skepticism is gone.  Desert Eagle is a gem.  We stopped in on a Thursday night and they had a great band playing, there were dogs and owners on the patio, and the beer was flowing.  We ordered a flight of 5 beers.  I was most impressed with the pomegranate wheat and I enjoyed the double IPA because it was really smooth and didn't slap you in the face with hops like most doubles do.  The bartender gave us a taste of the pumpkin brew and it put me in the mood for Fall.  It had great notes of nutmeg and pumpkin.  The bartender and the clientele were very welcoming and friendly to Downtown Mesa newbies.

When the barrista poured my latte with a little leaf design in the foam, I was instantly in love.  I felt like I was back at Stumptown Coffee Roasters in my beloved Portland, OR.  The vanilla latte I ordered was smooth and delicious.  It was just the right temperature so I didn't have to blow on it for half an hour just to take a sip.  For coffee like this, you're gonna pay a little more, but frankly it's worth it.  Pass Starbucks quickly and head to Cartel in terminal 4.

When trying to figure out what I would write for this review, and how many stars to award it, I was at a loss for words.  Snoh is so unlike anything I have ever eaten before, that I wasn't sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.  I am not a stranger to taro, green tea, mochi or anything, but I think I have concluded that they are just not flavors that appeal to me.  We brought my niece and nephew to Snoh because they are huge fans of frozen concoctions.  Never having been to Snoh before, we were a little lost looking at the menu.  I asked the employee what kids normally get there and he said original with Oreo and extra chocolate glaze.  I got the mango ice with mangoes and caramel glaze.  I didn't really want a glaze, but he acted like it was an essential part of the dessert.  I have to say that it would have tasted much better without the caramel glaze.  My sister in law got condensed milk on the top of hers and she couldn't even finish it.  If you want to get out of your comfort zone, this is a great place to do it.   I, however, will stick to good old fashioned ice cream.

As for delivery pizza, this is as good as it gets in AZ.  Forget all those big pizza chains.  You can't get the flavor from them like you can from Barro's.  I absolutely love the tomato sauce on their pizzas and the crust is doughy but not too soft nor too crispy.    As for their salads and their salad bar in the restaurant portion, it leaves a lot to be desired.  Iceberg lettuce?  Seriously?  At least throw me a bone and throw in some spinach or lettuce with a little color to it.  The toppings for the salad are not the best either.  If you stick to delivery with Barro's, you can't go wrong.

YUM!!!!  This place is a little gem in Mesa.  My hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch and apparently beat the rush, because right after we ordered, the line started growing out the door and onto the patio.  We ordered street tacos, of which we like both the beef ones the best.  We also both ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which was way too much food, but we both couldn't stop eating because it was one of the best bean and cheese burritos either of us had eaten before.  The salsa bar was also to die for- at least 4 different salsas to choose from along with cucumbers and pickled onions.  We took full advantage of the free check in offer of chips and salsa.  The salsa that came with the chips was chunky and juicy at the same time and had a ton of flavor!  Anytime I crave a burrito from now on, we'll be going to Backyard Taco!

I love the laid back atmosphere of this tasting room.  It reminds me of some of the tasting rooms we've been to in Oregon.  There are huge TV's that are great to watch football on and the bar wraps all the way around the back and side wall of the room.  They had a Hawaiian food truck outside when we visited and the smell was to die for.  They opened at 5pm, so it'd be great to come for a few drinks and bring in your dinner from the food truck.   There are windows behind the bar that look into the innards of the brewing operations.  It's nice to have fermenters as the view as you drink down a cold one.

Ive gotten a smoothie here a couple of times and they are always really good.  They pack a ton of fruits and veggies into the smoothies, including kale and spinach, but they don't taste like greens.  It's pretty pricey for the smoothies, but I think the bowls are actually pretty reasonable compared to other acai bowl places I've seen.  I wish the menu had descriptions of the smoothies because it would be easier than asking the person working there to tell me the contents of each one.

When my husband and I moved within walking distance to Spokes on Southern, we figured it would be our neighborhood bar.  I am sad to say that due to repeated episodes of bad service, that will not be happening.   The first time we tried this place, it was right before Halloween.  The bartender dressed as Duff Man was really nice and knowledgeable about the beer.  He is the one breath of fresh air that we have experienced here.  The next two times, we walked our dog to the patio, hoping to enjoy a pint before the walk home.  Both times, we were neglected by the servers for very long periods of time.  The second time, we waited 10 minutes just to order a beer.  We asked for just a few more minutes while we decided if we wanted something to eat.  Thirty minutes later, the server comes back to ask us if we've decided.  Yeah, we decided about 20 minutes ago when you completely disappeared that we no longer wanted anything else because no server was anywhere to be found.    The servers act as though the patio is an afterthought.  I don't know if they pull double duty and serve inside and outside at the same time, but if that's the case, it isn't working.  A few servers should probably be stationed outside because the service on the patio is severely lacking.

I'm in agreement with the masses about Matt's Big Breakfast.  It's super tasty!!  I have brought two groups of out of towners to Matt's when they've landed super early at Sky Harbor and they have all been impressed.  I am in love with their strawberry preserves.  I also love the sauteed onions in the breakfast sandwich.  Everything is better with sauteed onions.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed and deicious.

I saw a rep from Spoke and Wheel on a morning TV show last week and it sounded like the place to be, so I quickly bookmarked it.  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and we expected it to be a lot more busy than it was.  They have a huge dog friendly patio where you can park your bike while you eat.  The inside feels very cave-like and home-y.  We sat at the bar, which meant that we could take advantage of happy hour food and drink specials even though it wasn't quite time for food specials to go into effect.  The drink specials are some of the best in the valley.  A pitcher that yields at least 2.5 pints for only $5?!  Sign me up.  the red sangria for $5 was amazing too.    My hubby and I both ordered side salads to start.  My only critique is that the salad bowls were so small and so full that I was dumping stuff all over the bar.  The bowls were far too small for the salad in them.  I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and cole slaw and my hubby got an Italian sausage Panini with macaroni and cheese.  We both really liked what we ordered.    The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  The music that played in the main restaurant/bar area was so good that my hubby thought they had stolen his iPod!  The whole experience was great.  We now wish we lived close enough to ride our bikes there and get happy hour all day!

This is one of my least favorite music venues in Phoenix.  I have sat in many different areas and sections, and all are lackluster.  The sound is hit or miss depending on the concert and where you sit.  The lawn seats are usually the only affordable option, unless I just love the band playing.  We saw Train perform there a few months ago.  I thought I had bought some great seats because they were over $40 each, but when we arrived we weren't even in the lower section of seats.  Those seats were over $80!!  Outrageous!!  I can't stand sitting in the lawn at this venue because so many idiots smoke pot while sitting out there and you are forced to smell that disgusting smell for hours on end.  The beer and food are insanely expensive and very low quality.

There is a serious lack of delicious sushi restaurants in the West Valley, so when I saw Sushi Catcher listed as the "Best in the West" in Phoenix magazine, I immediately wanted to try it.  We visited on a Friday around 5pm.  I was worried that it would be packed because the article in PHX mag had just come out, but there were only two tables occupied when we arrived.    We ordered large beer and saki combos which were only $5 a piece.  They brought us complimentary cucumber and crab salads to start, which were so vinegary and delicious.  We completely over ordered here because we are used to small sushi rolls at every place we go.  We were not ready for the magnitude of the rolls at Sushi Catcher.  We also ordered Gyoza, which came with this heavenly cilantro/spicy/sweet pepper dipping sauce that was so good I wanted it pumped into my veins.  The rainbow roll was to die for.  One roll that I nor my husband were fans of was the scallop roll with salmon on top.  I love scallops when they are cooked, but when they aren't, the texture and flavor was enough to make me gag.  I couldn't eat more than one piece of this roll.  I just took the salmon off the top and ate it sashimi style.    They brought us a complimentary sampling of mochi ice cream in a couple of flavors and a scoop of green tea ice cream in the middle after the meal.  The mochi was a little like the ice cream was surrounded by the squishy inner-part of a jelly bean.   Over all, we loved most of the meal, but I'll have to go back one more time, maybe order a bento box, in order to push my review up to five stars.

Holy large portions, Batman!  I got the Big Gooey Scrambled Mess, a mix of eggs and various other breakfast meats/veggies and I was bust-a-gut full after only eating about 1/4th of it.  The preserves they serve with toast had to have been homemade because you can't get anything that good out of a jar.  The pinnacle of the breakfast was by far the fresh squeezed OJ.  I am a self proclaimed OJ snob, and I was about ready to do backflips over the deliciousness of OBH's OJ.  You get a refill with each OJ order, so you don't have to ration it to make it last throughout the meal.

My hubby and I ordered a flight of beer (8 different beers, 4 ounce pours.)  We really enjoyed most of the beers.  I could easily drink more of the dark and light Belgians.  My hubby loved the Octomalt.  We didn't eat any food, but we will make sure we try it on our next visit.  We will absolutely be back for another taste of those brews!

Number one happy hour spot in Gilbert, no contest!  There are quite a few drink choices on sale as well as tacos.  We loved the assortment of salsas available as well.  This is a great place to go on a spring day when they have the huge windows open.

The word on the street is that Pomo is where it's at.  I have tested that theory, and it proves to be true.  This place is fantastically tasty and has the best service I have encountered in a very long time.  My hubby and I were hungry after Yelp's Downtown Revival Event and we had seen Pomo at the event.  They obviously support Yelp, which means Yelpers must support them.    We walked in around 9pm, so it was only about half full.  We took a seat at the bar and ordered two glasses of wine.  The wine is all reasonably priced.  We ordered the Margherita pizza and added mushrooms (which might be a crime against humanity in Italy but that's how we like it).  We also spilt a salad to share.  The pizza was perfectly cooked.  Unlike some other Neapolitan pizza joints, this pizza had an even char across the entire pie.  It was an amazing pizza and you could tell that all the ingredients were the absolute best quality.  The bartender and our server for the evening, David, was making a delicious looking martini with hibiscus and peach schnapps so I went ahead and ordered one for myself as well.  I don't remember what it was called (the first glass of wine had already gone to my head) but it was one heck of a great martini.  For dessert, we ordered the cr√®me brulee which came with strawberries and raspberries on top.  It had amazing vanilla bean flavor and you could see the flecks of vanilla bean in the custard.    I have to say that the service from David definitely put this place over the top in terms of quality for us.  Give that man a raise!

In my book, Potbelly is 5 stars all the way.  I am used to getting Potbelly in the Midwest, complete with that Midwest hospitality.  That was definitely what was lacking when I visited this location in Scottsdale.  I am used to the employees asking "What ya havin'?" and getting people through the line so quickly, efficiently and friendly that it is a treat to eat there.  The employees at this location were a little less than enthused to be there and didn't acknowledge me until I was standing there for a few minutes waiting to order.  They also don't have the BIG size sandwiches which was a disappointment because my hubby can eat way more than the normal size Wreck sandwich.  The taste of the sandwich was just as good as I expect, but I needed a little bit more hospitality to reach 5 star normal Potbelly caliber.

Why is it so dang hard to find a great Chinese place???  Well, I am happy to say that we have finally found it.  It's located right next to the movie theater, and since we never see movies anymore, it took us a long time to stop in.  The next time I have a craving for lo mien noodles or orange chicken with a competitively priced brew, this is the place you will find me.  The service staff is very attentive and friendly.  The only small, minute thing that bugged me was the white butcher paper they lay on the tables.  It was cut so long that whenever I put my hands in my lap I got a paper cut!  Oops!

My hubby found this place on Yelp when he searched for "Burgers and beer," our two favorite things.  When he looked on Hopdoddy's website and found out they were from Texas, he was really interested in trying it.  I remember seeing this place on South Congress in Austin before.  If it's on Soco, it's gotta be good.    He ordered the Goodnight burger and I ordered the Llano Poblano burger.  We got a small side of fries, which really was only big enough for one person, so when we go back, we will be upgrading to the large to share.  The Llano Poblano has grilled poblano peppers, bacon, onion, tomato, and some sort of delectable sauce on it.  The Goodnight burger had fresh jalapeno and the best grilled onions my hubby had ever had.    They have a great local beer list, including beers from Phx and Flagstaff.  If you are jonesing for an AZ craft brew, this is the spot to go.  Our only knock on this whole place though, were the huge goblets that the beer comes in.  Those goblets are better suited for margaritas or a drink you can drink with a straw.  They are a little cumbersome and unstable for good hard beer drinking.  Overall, there is no question that we will be back!  I'm already craving that Chipotle ketchup again!!

I had heard about the "create your own pizza" revolution that is sweeping the U.S, yet I had not tried it until Fired Pie.  I totally understand the revolution now.  My hubby and I didn't know what to expect when we walked into Fired Pie, because this location was another failed pizza joint before Fired Pie moved in.  We decided to split a steak and blue salad, and we created our own pizza.  I love the variety of toppings and the fact that you can load that baby up with toppings as much as you want and you don't pay any extra!  We got cappricola ham on our pizza which isn't readily available most places.  They also serve Bellini's, which the cashier let me have a taste of to make sure I liked it.  It tasted a bit like a lightly peach flavored slushy champagne.  Very good.  I also love that they have fresh squeezed lemonade.  We ordered a Pizza cookie for dessert, which was delicious, but small.  I wanted it all for myself!  Next time, we are ordering two!  No sharing for me!

Maybe I live under a rock, but I had no idea that Roosevelt had so many great restaurants/shops.  We were hungry after a DBacks, game so we stopped in here for a bite and a drink.  It was about an hour until closing, so the place was quite empty.  We sat at the bar, and my hubby ordered a craft beer that even he had never heard of, and I got a cabernet on tap.  I love the tap wine selection; 4 different wines.  There are also 4 craft beer selections.  We ordered the Moki, which was a delectable mix of beans, tomato, mayo, cheese, and a few other yummy items on a bratwurst, all enveloped by the best "bun" I have ever eaten around a hot dog.  It was more like a thick tortilla.   It was warm and soft and pillowy.   The chips that came with it tasted like they had just been made in house.  You better believe that this won't be our last trip to Short Leash!

We love Barro's pizza for delivery or pickup.  I wouldn't reccommend a salad there because it's only made of iceberg lettuce which seems pointless to me, but the pizza is always wsaucy and always has a ton of toppings.

What's not to love?!  The always offer to give you samples of flavors that might interest you and the flavors never disappoint.  I love that there are so many combinations of custard and ice.  The locations in AZ don't have even a fraction of the flavors I have seen in Rita's locations in New Jersey, but I still love what they've got.  I usually get vanilla custard with lemonade and raspberry, which is an amazing flavor combo!

It seems like a new brewery opens every other day in the valley and the quality of some is questionable.  Huss Brewing, however, is the real deal.  My hubby and I love to drink and talk with the people at the bar (fellow Tempe-ans are just so damn friendly) and enjoy their libations.  We are big fans of Rise of Rio and if I'm in the mood for something light, Scottsdale Blonde is the way to go.  They have a ton of great merch, and we'll be reppin' this place in our house because we bought one of their tackers.  Go see Nora at the bar.  She'll take great care of you!

I now know why Ratebeer.com showered this place with such an amazing award.  Their beer is amazing!  The Hellsgate Imperial Saison is so smooth that you would have no idea that it had such a high alcohol content until you saw the little snifter they pour it into.  It's all good, because I'll take quality over quantity any day.  My hubby loved their double IPA.  We took advantage of the burger and a beer for $10 special and absolutely devoured our burgers.  The food held it's own with such amazing beer by it's side.  My only question is, where can I get my very own AZ Wilderness tacker to hang on my wall at home? We collect them and I want to rep AZ Wilderness!

We were totally bummed when the Uncle Bear's location in Chandler went out of business, so we were interested in trying this location.  I know that they are trying to shy away from being known as a sports bar and are trying to be more well known for brewing, but I really don't think their beer is top quality yet.  I did appreciate the farmhouse saison though because a lot of breweries don't even attempt those.  We like Uncle Bear's for the great Happy Hour and daily specials.  Every seat at the bar is perfect for watching the game.  We love the tostada nachos and the sliders.

My hubby and I moved back to the East Valley after a two year stint in the northwest valley where we were totally obsessed with Yen Sushi at 43rd Ave and Bell.  We have been searching for a place to fill Yen's shoes ever since we moved back.  We have found our new go-to sushi place.  Thank you Bei!    The cucumber salad was vinegar-y and delicious and the free check-in miso soup was nicely salty sprinkled with the crunch of scallions.   We ordered the Bei roll which was such a pleasant surprise.  Every piece of roll was a new adventure because they all have different fish toppings.  They have a lot of selections for happy hour rolls as well as drinks .  One suggestion: add Sapporo to the happy hour beer selections.  Why Kirin and not Sapporo?

We were more than happy to make use of the buy one get one free meal coupons and the free soft drink coupons.  My hubby and I took some photos in the photo booth too.  The families on the patio were getting a kick out of the accessories for use in the photo booth.  Not bad for my first official Yelp event.

Joe's is the perfect place to go on a hot summer day.  When we walked in, we were greeted immediately by a free sample of pineapple ice that was soooo good.  I ended up getting Strawberries and cream and my mom got Tiger's Blood- a mix of strawberry, watermelon and coconut.  They were both great tasting flavors.  The service was awesome and they were willing to let us taste anything we wanted.

I have a very recent frame of reference to analyze the flavor of Belgian waffles because we ate waffles in Belgium only a few months ago.  With the first bite of my Waffle Crush waffle, I was transported back to the streets of Brugge.  I ordered the waffle with speculos spread, strawberries and their luscious whipped cream.  I could eat that cream on everything!  The waffle had a crisp texture on the outside, but was perfectly soft and sugary on the inside.  I'm gonna start stalking this truck!!  Everything runs about $7-7.50 and you can creat your own waffle starting at $4.

When I read that these owners also own El Zocalo in Chandler, I was super excited to try what they had to offer.   I love that they serve breakfast burritos all day.  We are always looking for a good breakfast burrito, and we found it here.  It has huge chunks of potato, egg, and either bacon, sausage or chorizo.  The salsa they serve here is absolutely transcendent.  I could eat that stuff like soup!  It's spiciness hits you after a few bites and slaps you in the face!  My hubby and I were both sniffing through the whole meal due to the salsa clearing out or sinuses, but neither of us could stop eating it.  The tortillas are just as good as Carolina's, but a little bit thicker, which seems to keep the burritos from tearing as easily.  Next time, I'm ordering the shrimp burrito because it looks like a winner as well!

This is the Chipotle of Asian cuisine.  It's fresh, it's healthy, and it's filling.  You can choose white or brown rice or cold noodles, then choose your protein.  After that, you can add one of two types of veggie mixes.  My hubby was a little disappointed because both the veggie mixes had broccoli in them, which he hates, so he had to skip the veggies altogether.  I think they should have more than two of the same veggie medley.  Maybe let people choose each veggie individually that they'd like instead of having them all mixed.  I liked the variety of sauces too.    One thing that really impressed me about Foosia was the use of sustainable and earth friendly products.  Nothing in this restaurant is thrown out.  Instead, it is all either composted or recycled.  If every restaurant had a conscience like Foosia, this world would be a much cleaner place.

We decided to try Little Miss BBQ on a tip from another Yelper whose taste in food is comparable to my own.  It did not disappoint.  We arrived at about 1030 and the cars were beginning to pile in.  There was a line of about 20-25 people once it opened.  The line does move slowly because the owner cuts the meat himself and often gives those waiting in line samples of things they have never tried before.   We ordered the fatty and lean brisket (both of which melt in your mouth), the sausage, and the pork ribs.  We were going to order the beef ribs which they only have on the weekend, but when the owner cut one for the person in front of us, we realized that none of us had an appetite as huge as one of those ribs!  There were at least 4" inches thick of meat on those bones!!   The pork rib meat fell right off the bone and was super flavorful and juicy.  The sausage is made in house.  We also ordered the potato salad which is made of chunks of red potato, jalapeno cheddar grits (amazing), and cole slaw.  All were equally amazing.  I especially loved the half liter Mexican Coke bottles that they sell to wash down the BBQ.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating.  You'll want to be in the front of the line though, because there are only about 6 tables in the inside dining room.  It's not fun to eat hot BBQ outside in the AZ summer!

So this is my new favorite sandwich place in AZ.  I had heard about it a few times, so it was on my radar, but I didn't realize how freaking good it would be.  I love all the kitschy names for the sandwiches... although you won't find me ordering one named after a SF Giants player! ;)  I ordered the Tony Soprano; turkey, ham, salami, Italian dressing and provolone.  All their sandwiches come with dirty sauce.  My mom ordered the Paul Ruebens and she wasn't sure how the dirty sauce would taste on it, but she loved it.  The moral of the story is- Always get the dirty sauce!   The service was fantastic.  The girl that brought out our to go order was so friendly and invited us back again.  I loved the classic 90's music playing in the restaurant too.  It's always fun to rock out to New Kids on the Block which waiting for your yummy sandwich.

We love stopping in here on our way home from a long bike ride around the canals.  They don't have bike parking very close, so that should change, but we just lock them up to the fence.  The bartenders are always friendly and willing to give us samples.  We love the chips and salsa because the chips always come out hot and the salsa is delicious!  We had the Peri peri chicken sandwich last time we stopped in and it was really good but really spicey so beware!

I really really love the custard at Freddy's.  It's so creamy and they have a ton of creative flavor and ingredient combinations to choose from.  The burgers are quite good, but the meat itself is super thin and crispy because of the way they smash it on the grill.  That could be improved, but the overall flavor is great.

We were totally bummed when we missed happy hour by just a few minutes, but this place was still a winner.  Happy hour ends at 6pm BTW.  I was impressed with the craft beer selection here.  I had a firestone DBA Amber and my hubby had a Founder's brew.  We both built our own burgers, and with the help of the server, decided not to go with Kobe beef.  She said Kobe is the best if you like your burger medium rare.  I don't like my burger moo-ing at me, so I went with regular sirloin, which was still totally tender and juicy.  I love the range of topping for the burgers and especially the many different sauce choices since I am a true sauce junkie.  The also have the choice of a buffalo burger (although it is the most expensive of them all) which is a good healthier option.  We both got side salads with our burgers and they were huge and were more than just lettuce, which made me happy.

I can't give this place a full five stars until I taste the beer they brew themselves.  I love the setup of this place.  The bar is large and forms a half circle in the front room.  If you like watching the chefs work while you dine, there is a smaller bar on the right that looks directly into the kitchen.  They only serve local beers right now.  We were excited to try beers from Beast Brewing in Bisbee at Mother Bunch.  I haven't seen those beers on tap anywhere else throughout the valley.  The bartenders were very friendly and obviously love what they do.  They also seemed really excited for Mother Bunch beers that are set to debut really soon.  We didn't have dinner here, but we had a stout brownie that was out of this world chocolaty goodness!

It's about freakin' time that a place like this open up in the Northwest Valley!  That also proves problematic though because this place is ALWAYS packed and it's hard to get a spot in the bar.  More times than I can count we have walked in, haven't found a single seat anywhere in the huge bar area, and left.  The beers they have on tap leave a lot to be desired.  Where's all the craft beer selection?  It's pretty non-existent.  We do love the dessert cookie with ice cream on it.  Sooo good!

I was quite impressed by every aspect of this new addition to the craft beer scene in the valley.  I ordered a tasting flight and my hubby ordered the IPA.  I am a huge fan of Belgian style brews, so I was super excited to see two Belgians on the menu.  They didn't disappoint.  We ordered a BBQ sandwich and we both loved it.  The service was prompt and friendly.

My hubby and I love this place, especially for breakfast!  If you have a hankering for a breakfast burrito, look no further than Salazar Bros.  We ordered the potato egg and cheese and added bacon to them.  Each burrito is huge so order one and split it if you aren't ravenously hungry.  I love their tortillas.  As a self proclaimed bean expert, their beans pass muster.  The inside is extremely clean, which usually means that the kitchen is also kept just as clean.

We never find ourselves this far west, so when we did, we made sure to make a stop at Saddle Mountain.  My hubby and I ordered the pretzels with mustard and beer cheese as our appetizer.  The pretzels were very bready and not pretzel-like at all.  The mustard tasted like they made it themselves.  The bartender said she loved the cheese the most, but we loved the mustard much better.  We also ordered the buffalo burger.  It was great of them to split the order and put it on two different plates so it was easier for us to share.  It wasn't great when I bit down on a 1" piece of toothpick that was in my burger.  It looked like it was a part of a toothpick they use to keep the burger together, but the one in my burger was intact, so who knows how it got in there.    My hubby and I both chose our own beers for our flights.  He chose all the hoppy beers and I chose the more malty beers.  I loved the amber ale and he loved the IPA's.

After looking at a few other bike shops, I found exactly what I was looking for at The Pedal.  There is virtually no signage (because the City of Tempe charges businesses an arm and a leg for it) so make sure you don't drive past!  They always have a row of bikes out front.  There is a small parking area in the back.  They also have another location next to Taste of Tops on University and Mill.  They carry a lot of different brands, but not the "Big 3" because he doesn't want to dedicate all his inventory to only a few brands.  They also fixed my hubby's bike on short notice.  We got great service from everyone there.  They even hooked me up with some free pedals since I bought the bike that day!

I can't speak for the food, but I can say that the margaritas they have for Happy Hour are dang good!  They're only like $3 on happy hour which is basically a steal.  We were served complimentary chips and salsa even though we weren't ordering food which was really nice.  The bartender was very attentive and had a great repoir with all the patrons.

This spot is right next to Four Peaks Brewing on 8th street, so the parking can get a little difficult in the afternoon.  We stopped by in the morning (coffee hours) instead of the afternoon (beer hours) so we were able to get a spot right in front.  Infusion has a small quaint eating and sitting area and a nice patio when the weather cools off.  I ordered a caramel latte and it was so buttery and creamy.  It reminded me a lot of the one at Cartel.  Delicious.  My hubby didn't really know what to get because there were a ton of choices.  The guy at the register didn't really help much but the guy making the coffee offered a few suggestions.  My hubby still felt a little misguided though, so I hope on the future the cashiers are also schooled on the coffee so they are able to make suggestions to the customers.  They sell bags a coffee beans and every type of press/roaster you can imagine.

This place is an amazing addition to the beer scene in Old Town.  My hubby and I came in during lunch  and they had a Pizza and beer special going on.  I was incredibly impressed with the local beer selection.  My husband's favorite AZ beer is Sacred Beast from Beast Brewing and they had it on tap there.  My hubby was in heaven!  I was also pleased to try some beers from Flagstaff breweries that I hadn't tried yet, like Wanderlust Brewing.    The pizza is an authentic wood fired and delicious.  We shared a peperoni and onion pizza and it was right up there with what Pomo makes.

Two words: Dole Whip.  I thought you could only get the stuff at Disney parks or in Hawaii.  Now I can get it at the Frozen Monkey! Yay!  Not only did they have the pineapple flavor, but they had raspberry which I had never even heard of before.  I got a swirl of raspberry and pineapple, and man, was I a happy camper!

I was expecting this place to be an order at the counter sort of place, but it ended up being a sit down restaurant.  We ordered the crab cakes, which didn't have that much flavor, although we did really like the tarter sauce that came with them.  My hubby and I loved the pinto beans that came with our beer battered fish and grilled shrimp tacos.  They are a little bit spicy and they have some crunch with the onion and green pepper.  Hubby also loved the rice.  It was moist and flavorful.  We weren't as impressed with the tacos.  I thought the beer batter would add flavor to the fish tacos, but the only thing with flavor was the cream sauce.  The shrimp in the shrimp tacos didn't have much seasoning at all.  If it wasn't for the sauces, the tacos would have totally fallen flat.  The service was great and our server was very friendly and attentive, but I doubt we'll be back because the food fell short.

The exterior of the building is very eye catching.  The interior doesn't disappoint either with it's tall ceilings and industrial look.  The bar is a huge cement square and there is plenty of seating.  We were there on Thursday night the week it opened, and there were very few tables open and only two bar stools open.  Our bartender, Cheryl, was very nice and introduced herself and asked our names.  She was quick to take our drink and food orders and was very friendly.  We ordered a pizza and the fish sandwich to share.  The fish sandwich was a little bland.  I think the fish needed more seasoning or maybe they could beer batter it for more flavor.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the tarter sauce that came with it.  The pizza was good, but pretty greasy.  The beer was fantastic and I can't wait until all those taps are full with more selections!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  This is an ice cream parlor from Chicago that serves ice cream that is light and creamy.  The cinnamon is especially delicious.  I got the cookies and cream and cookie dough flavor.  If you order one scoop, they can do half and half and give you two flavors, which I thought was really nice.  They also have Mackinaw Island fudge here, which any Michigander will appreciate.

We got a coupon for a free meal for Fresh Millions, so who am I to give up a free food opportunity?  Looking at the pictures for the food online didn't really make me too excited about trying it, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by our experience.   I got a hot chicken bowl with a noodle base and a sweet and spicy sauce. I loved the sauce because it reminded me of that yummy sauce they have at Pei Wei to dip your spring rolls in.  Love that stuff.   My hubby got a Buffalo Chicken Panini and a Chicken salad wrap.  The Buffalo Chicken Panini had great flavor, but the bread was insanely think.  A panini has thin bread that is pressed to be made even thinner.  Their bread overtook the entire sandwich.  His wrap was a little boring because they only let you have two veggie mix ins and he chose ranch dressing.  If he would have chosen a different dressing, he probably would have liked it better.  He said it needed salt and pepper.   Next time, we'll have a better understanding of what to try.  The man that helped us was very friendly to everyone that walked in.

This location has really upped the cool factor for all other Pita Jungles out there.  They hired an LA based graffiti artist to tag the walls in virtually every area of the restaurant.  Check out the men's restroom door; very clever.  The outdoor patio and multiple bar areas are great for busy nights.  I would love to see them up the caliber of their beer selection like some other locations have.  The only real "craft" selection they have is Ballast Point Sculpin, and, let's be honest, they just sold out for 1 billion dollars.  So come on, Pita Jungle.  Expand that craft beer selection.  I did love the wine on tap, including the wine that I enjoyed that gave all the profits to autism research.  Very cool.  The cilantro lime hummus is my favorite appetizer anywhere.  They had specially made olive oil and balsamic vinegar to eat with it as well that tasted amazing.  The bar service was fantastic.  Let's hope this doomed space finds it's permanent resident with Pita Jungle!
