Sitting at the cabanas , the staff needs to make the customer aware of the $15.00 gratuity fee.the wait staff and bartenders  where easily confused with orders and lost my credit card for a short period of time. Additionally,  the food was overcooked  and dry and bland, despite specifically asking for the burger to be prepared as medium rare. I would not recommend the food service here as the options are not quality. The only thing that was right was the pouring of drinks which were alcohol heavy. So if your looking for strong drinks to coinside with the high drink prices; come here.

The restaurant is clean, inviting and the aromas of freshness and flavor are ever present.  The pho was good and the jasmine green tea tasted good.
