Round and short! It is not that complicated. I was unfortunately very disappointed. They tried to get me in and out in 10 minutes, like really ?  They tried to just and file my nails and not cut them. After she was done and asked if I liked. I asked if she was going to shorten my nails and she started clipping them with a cuticle cutter. Basically I would never come back and would not recommend anyone to go here.

This location really gives bagel places a bad name.    I don't know why I continue to keep trying and going back to this establishment. Probably because it is right across the street from work.  No matter what I order a bagel with cream cheese or a egg and cheese on a bagel it just takes forever.  This morning I literally walked out when I was online. They had about 6 people waiting to order for over 10 minutes!  Secondly, I don't love their food that takes 6 hours to make. that is being handled by ex cons working there and people who do not care about their   I am not going back. I mean it this time. For real I will be going to chompies which is a mile away and get better, faster, and product.

Brent the owner is truly top notch! He is very competitor, and knowledgable about everything. From custom pieces to loose stones he has never let me down. I will continue to shop here and refer people to them.   Just so you know there is nothing they cannot do or something they cannot get. They will go above and beyond.

I have never been so disappointed by a restaurant before. We had a reservation for 7:15 and were seated by 7:20 which was great. After we ordered our meals and waited an hour and fifteen minutes for the food to come, we decided we cannot keep waiting, and walked out. They offered everyone around us chips and salsa because they knew it was taking longer then expected but apparently we did not count. It is a real shame because we had high hopes as the atmosphere and menu seemed really nice.

Burger21 was a great experience. You can taste the freshness in the meat with every bite. After talking with the owner for a few minutes you can tell his passion for food and burgers. They have a vast selection of burgers, and food. They have close to 10+ different dipping sauces and was very impressed.  The only item I wished had a little better taste or texture would be the generic regular fries.   Hats off to Burger21 and I am glad to add this to my lunch rotation.
