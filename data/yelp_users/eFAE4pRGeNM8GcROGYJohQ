First off, my wife and I are 'die hard' Target fans, so it pains me a bit to write this review. I will be taking my business elsewhere after my experience tonight.   The intent of our visit to Target this evening was to buy a new grill. However, instead of leaving with a state of the art grilling machine, I left the store empty handed, with a bad attitude, and with a terrible taste in my mouth.   When we walked back to the area of the store where this Target displays their grills, the area was being remodeled for new products to be displayed. But there were a couple of nice grills out on display, one of which, I planned on purchasing for nearly $300.   I asked an employee for help and he mentioned "I don't work that area" and he called someone over who would help, apparently. The gentleman came over, I asked him general questions about price and availability which he was unsure of both. I asked if I could purchase the floor model and he replied "we can't sell the display model because of liability concerns."   Why would you put products out on display that you can't sell? I was going to spend $300 just like that...but this Target doesn't need the additional revenue apparently.

This place has very good Chinese food. Also, the lady running the show was very friendly and made great recommendations. In fact, I'd recommend the chicken dish that I had but I'm not entirely sure what it's called. It's a spicy chicken dish. The house low mein was VERY tasty too.

Great food, authentic feel, and attentive service.   "Do not judge a book by its cover" is what comes to mind when I think about our visit to La Pi√±ata. I really enjoyed our server Jose as he was very upbeat and enthusiastic about the menu. The Guacamole appetizer  is awesome and their chips taste like they are homemade.   Both my wife and I had great dishes - carnitas and combination fajitas. Both dishes were served with excellent homemade tortillas.    I recommend this "hole in the wall" Mexican joint. It's guaranteed not to disappoint.

Cool, trendy coffee shop with great iced coffee and amazing baked goods. This is one of the best spots in Central Phoenix to grab a cup of coffee/tea and a snicker doodle.

Good luck putting down the warm focaccia...I dare you to try!!!  This is the BEST Italian food that I've had in Arizona- hands down.   My family and I have been eating at Miele's monthly for over 5 years now. The staff is great, the pasta is to die for, and the pizza is even better.  Do yourself a favor and order their "linguine and clams" if you want to bite into a little piece of heaven.

Hands down the best Mexican food in Phoenix. And that says a lot with nearly an endless selection of Mexican restaurants across the valley.

We had a great experience with this company thus far. The sales team was not aggressive, knowledgeable, and helped us save some money during the account setup process.   The tech that did the install, Dale, was prompt, thorough and very friendly. He was eager to answer all of my questions and didn't rush the process.    We are very pleased so far...
