This place has been here in this location forever. I remember coming here as a kid when it was called "The Spaghetti Company" and regarding it as a major treat. The restaurant is housed in what looks like somebody's house on the corner of Central and McDowell, (and I always thought it was.) The interior is cavernous and museum-like, with old Victorian-era photographs, bookshelves, hidden rooms, chandeliers, and antiques on the walls. There's even a trolley cable car in the middle of the place where you can sit in and eat. As a child, I thought this was the coolest place ever. My brother and I would even go off and "explore" the restaurant when we finished our meals.  So, this place definitely has nostalgia for me. I always thought it was a unique, special place and that the people that were in the photographs lived in there at one point and now probably haunted the restaurant from the hidden upstairs level (how do you get up there?! There must be a hidden staircase somewhere...)  But then my young, naive little mind discovered the existence of a little thing called a "chain restaurant." "Wait, so you mean there's ANOTHER Spaghetti Factory? In Fresno?! I thought this was the only one? I thought it was a Phoenix thing?" I wasn't sure what to make of that fact. I felt a little bit betrayed, as a matter of fact. Maybe it wasn't as magical and old as I thought. Regardless, the building it has occupied for the past twenty (thirty?) years has real charm and history, and I'm glad it's home to the Spaghetti Factory, and not a Cricket phone paycenter.   The food isn't really anything special. Honestly, it's rather forgettable. But then again, I was always more focused on finding the secret book that would open the trapdoor than on my lasagna. I haven't ever had a terrible experience with service or the food, but it's certainly nothing to rave about. I came here the other weekend with some friends and we had a good time; had nothing to complain about. The portions are rather small, however.   Now that it's directly across from the lightrail maybe I will stop by if I'm in the area. It will always have a sort of nostalgic status in my mind, but I have to say, I love the OSF of 1991the best.

The Ranch Market isn't necessarily Food City; grocery prices aren't rock-bottom. But why go to the Ranch Market to get Kraft macaroni and cheese? Seek out the products that are made here. They're cheaper and better!  They make their own tortillas here, which are inexpensive and fresh. You can literally watch them be made, packaged up, and placed on the shelf. The salsas that are made here are also delicious and taste homemade. The food in the restaurant part of the store has been nothing short of delicious in my opinion. If you don't speak Spanish however, there may be a slight language barrier during the ordering process, especially if you have modifications or special requests. Touch-up on your numbers because your order will be called out in Spanish via loud-speaker.   The aguas frescas taste great and are cheap. I love tamarindo and papaya. Yes, there are going to be small bits in the drink - it's made from real fruit. If you can't handle that, they do sell Capri Sun juice boxes, too.   All in all, the "authenticity" of this place isn't what should be in question. I think it is rather authentic. It's a Latin-oriented chain supermarket run by people who know about the products that community seeks. And that's exactly what it says it is, right?  Highlight: Live music in the aisle!

A friend of mine and I have been going here for lunch for a while. Our tradition would include escaping from school/work on Mondays and meeting up here for lunch. The coffee is good, the pastries are great, and the food is excellent. They used to have this iced tea there (but seemed to have swapped it for something else as of late) that was unbelievable. We called it the "Tea of Freedom." It tasted like a promising adventure awaiting you just around the corner. Stop laughing! It was really damn good iced tea. But just as it came into my life, it was gone just as elusively.  The owners are accommodating and charming. On slow days we would see him sitting outside with a demitasse of espresso and reading French newspaper, only to hop to his feet when we walked in.   It does appear the prices have gone up, and they're approaching steepness for a cafe, but this is the Biltmore after all.   Highlight: Don't know what to get? Ask for a recommendation. You won't be sorry.

I stopped in here with a friend on a whim because a) we were in the area and b) it was hot, and a scoop of fro yo sounded like a good idea. I'm not really a huge ice cream or frozen yogurt aficionado but I'm glad we stopped here.   The girl who was working alone in the shop was a pleasant little ray of sunshine! They were about to close, and we were probably the last ones to come in, but she was still super friendly and talkative. I have to admit, when I worked in food service I was one of those that would sigh and eye-roll all over the place when people would walk in five minutes before closing time. But that didn't happen here. In fact, she offered up samples of whatever we wanted, even after I made a comment likening the yogurt to play-dough.   I prefer fro yo to ice cream because I don't have much of a sweet tooth, and the stuff here is great. I'll be back.

(2 1/2 stars).  Don't get me wrong, I love hanging out here and have been doing so for a while. It's a unique spot and has a kind of awkward-but-homey feel, like it's housed in a building it's not really supposed to be in. The vibe is upbeat and friendly for the most part and it's kind of cool to hang out in a VAULT. But the two-star rating comes from the most important reason why I'm here, yo: the coffee.  I have never once had HOT coffee here. I like my coffee searing hot. Like lava. But I always get flaccid, limp, lukewarm beverages here. I even specified "extra hot" once and it still wasn't up to temp.  But the tea selection is really good. I like how the loose leaf is presented in a way that you can see the contents of what's in the tea blends. And the pastries always look very tempting. There's a lot of fun, zany stuff on the menu, but I have the coffee tastes of an old man. I want it plain, strong, and hot. XB seems like it may be more geared toward providing caffeine bombs pumped with sweet stuff for students pulling all-nighters.

Ghetto. Classless. Surly-ass crew that needs a reality check on how to work in a service-oriented profession.   Get this: the reading lights above my seat would not go out. On a 9 hour red-eye flight to Europe. They just wouldn't turn off. There were a few other seats with the same problem. So what did the stewardess do? She stuck a styrofoam cup over the light. "THERE."  Never again.

Listen, I COULD have danced here... The night I went I thought the DJ was actually spinning pretty well. We danced a little bit but I kept getting weird looks from the collar-popped meat heads next to us (who weren't dancing). Their looks were saying to me, "You mean you're dancing... without a female ass parked up in your crotch? What the hell are you doing?!"  Douchyness abounds. CK1 is heavy in the air. Drinks are expensive and even though we had bottle service, our waitress was over at the other table flirting most of the time. Oh, and she didn't know how to make anything.

One's experience at Kazmierz can really depend on when you go and who you go with. Moreso than most places, it seems. For example, one night I came here with some friends and it was packed to the brim with obnoxious socialites getting wasted on their husbands' Amexes. I felt like I could have had the same deal across the street with a Smirnoff Ice at Saddle Ranch. But on my last visit to Kazmierz it was quiet and mellow with middle eastern music in the air. I also sat next to a tipsy "Francesca" at the bar who claimed to be able to read my aura.  I for one, love Kazmierz for the little elitist comments peppered throughout the wine menu and the general nose-positioned-firmly-upward attitude about wine that most of the staff has. Sometimes it's just more fun when you're drinking a Slovenian white from a place you've never heard of and certainly couldn't pronounce. There are definitely some things on this menu you won't see anywhere else. You have to be adventurous. If you are looking for your usual glass of KJ, you're going to get a scoff and chuckle. (Oh, and never ask for a mint julip, either.)   As far as the food goes, it's good. Their Egyptian Flatbread pizzas are surprisingly delicious. And the fondue was enjoyable.  But the wine is really where it's at. Kazmierz is impressive, unpredictable, and a little bit strange, but boasts the best wine list in Old Town by far.

Grimaldi's doesn't make the absolute BEST pizza in town, but it definitely is good. The ambiance and overall vibe of the place works really well. It's elegant, but casual. The food speaks for itself: come here to eat some pizza, not to be seen.   Grimaldi's offers a surprisingly nice wine menu focusing on Italian (or Italian style) reds. I had a personal favorite, Coppola Claret with an italian sausage/sweet roasted pepper pizza and was in love. Another great "pizza wine" they offer is the Antinori Santa Cristina Sangiovese. Delicious. We had dessert as well, which was pretty good. The tiramisu my friend had was great. Pair it with a glass of Rosa Regale with it. It's... sexual.   Most of the time that I've eaten here has been work-related wine tastings, but the service has always been attentive and prompt. Grimaldi's fills a nice niche in OTS of being an upscale, yet casual and uncomplicated pizza place.

Big Fish has cleaned up its act, just a bit. I went there last night with a few friends after not having been in at least a year and it looks... nicer somehow. Yes it's a little divey, but divey with a smile. It's actually pretty clean and maintained inside. I think the term "neighborhoody" would be more appropriate.  We sat at the bar and were taken care of right away. I struck up a conversation with the bartender about how we wanted Agwa mojitos, and he only responded with a quizzical look. "Uh... We don't make ANY mojitos here."   Oh really? Hmm. You see, Big Fish was voted "Best Place to Drink Agwa" by the New Times, and the article mentioned something about a wonderful glorious Agwa mojito that the bar makes. So, we wanted 'em. But to no avail. Notice: They don't make mojitos at Big Fish. EVER. The New Times lied. They do however, make "Liquid Speedballs" which is Agwa, Sprite and Red Bull. So if you ever need to give yourself a heart attack AND get drunk at the same time, this is your shit.   Later in the night some drunk dude spilled me and my friend's beers all over the bartop, and before we could even say anything the bartender had us covered with ice cold new ones. Very nice!   There is also a small stage, but tuesday night is Rock Band Night (the video game) so people were playing that. Fun! We ended up joining in with some of the other people playing. They have a little sign up sheet so you can play with your group whenever you're up. No drama, just hangin' out. See, neighborhoody!

This location is a pleasant, "cozy" restaurant that can fill up fast during rush hours. Call ahead, or get take out if it's packed. The food is very good; the signature dish that gives the restaurant its name is my favorite.   Thai food is traditionally spicy. You know this. You expect this. You want this. On my last visit, I ordered my food at the "medium" level, and it was not spicy at all. Certainly not "Thai medium." Are they holding back?   Plus, Thai always makes the BEST leftovers. I purposely save a portion of my dish every time just so I can have it stew in its own juices for 24 hours and reheat it the next day. YES. ...Is that weird?

When you go to "the bar" in Tempe, you go to Casey's. It is THE neighborhood bar (literally), and it always feels like home.   In the summer, sit outside and sip on your ice cold beer. In the winter, sit under the heat lamps and bundle up to whoever you're sitting next to. It doesn't change; Casey's is always a good time.

I've been to Amsterdam quite a few times, and it remains one of my favorite bars in Phoenix. Get there before midnight to avoid the cover (which isn't bad, anyway). The inside is elegant in an over the top way (come on, the homoerotic statues-in-handcuffs on the bar top are just lovely!) and the patio outside is comfortable, although the flow of the place is a bit awkward. The drinks are good, albeit a bit inconsistent. For example, I ordered a gin and tonic, got a nice stiff glass, came back for another, and got a dixie cup with too much ice. Their famous martinis are great, but to me seem to be more of a novelty than a real drink (Fruit Stripe Gum, anyone?)   There's a bit of diva attitude floating around, but as it should be for any yuppie gay space. Amsterdam is the perfect place to go with a group of friends for cocktails, and it seems as though that's the majority of the crowd here. Not much of a meat market vibe going on at all.   I've heard some "interesting" and "terrifying" stories about the ladies' room, but all in all Amsterdam is comfortable and fun; you can dance inside (or out), mingle, and smoke and drink at the same time on the weird tiki patio. A mainstay in Phoenix for sure!

From the voyeuristic "HE/SHE" bathrooms to the big-ass "look at what you're missing" windows, to the rotating and (usually) interesting art installments, the ambiance at AZ 88 boasts a sort of funky, yet arrogant sexuality that is unique. The crowd has seemed to be quite varied in my experience. But this is OTS, and the usual rules apply.   The current setup of art includes huge pseudo-abstract figures in Kama-Sutra-like sexual positions on the gigantic windows. One per window! It's sort of like a tutorial. I would imagine many a over-the-shoulder-sweater wearing aging socialite has gasped at the "inappropriateness" of this. Good. Gasp away, Maude. Props to AZ 88 for being dirty/classy.   The food is not cheap, but not expensive either. It's completely accessible, even casual, which might be different than what some people would expect. But I totally get it. I mean, what's wrong with looking good and having a grilled cheese?  Personally, I would recommend AZ 88 as a place to get cocktails. The prices here are no more or less than any other equivalent restaurants/bars in the area and they do great martinis. The wine list isn't anything crazy, but they do offer a somewhat hard to find but inexpensive Spanish red called Carchelo that is awesome.   Highlight: Come here for drinks and to hang before going dancing to one of the more rowdier (or raunchier?) clubs in the area.

My douchebag radar was so far off the scale here I just shut it off completely. There's stairs ALL OVER the place, (I swear, some drunk chick in stilettos is going to fling herself down one of these one day) silly fog machines and unenthusiastic go-go dancers, with security guards standing watch at every doorway. Do you really need that much security? Eh, to be fair, I did witness some drama go down.   I would hate to live in a world where I subscribed to the thought that Axis/Radius is THE hippest nightlife destination in the Phoenix metro area. Sadly, a lot of people seem to be trapped in this mindset. The patrons walk around in a zombie-like daze. In their intense social longing to "be someone," or "find someone" they force themselves to frequent this club hoping to be seen by the right person, maybe get a snapshot on 944 or Dirty Scottsdale .com. It is true that this is quintessential Scottsdale, but it is not representative of the entire city's scene as a whole, as some sadly write it off as.   Highlight: Dancing to "Sandstorm."

I love BS West. But more as a novelty than anything else. I'm not sure if I would necessarily classify this place as "unpretentious." There is certainly some diva spiciness in the air here. But at the same time, it's friendly and fun. The crowd is consists solely of sexed up, well-groomed 20 somethings. And that one older skinny guy with platinum hair and the Bono earring.   BS is really only busy on Wednesdays when they have their 2-for-1 drink special all night. Then, it's packed. Wall to wall. Unfortunately, the drinks aren't so great. You really have to know the bartenders for them to make you a good one, with so many free drinks flying around (and people not tipping when they get them,) they slack. You might be better off opting for beer.   For us smokers, the proximity of the patio to the bar and dancefloor is nice. In other words, you don't have to isolate yourself to have a smoke. It's all one big churning pot of hair product and muscle, baby. This the place to people watch; ridiculousness abounds without fail. But the best thing about this place is undeniably its dancefloor. There are giant video screens in sync with what's playing (and no ADD DJ mixes). One of the best gay bars in Phoenix to dance at for sure. Nothing tired and stereotypical, just good booty music. Sometimes you need to get toasted and have a little Beyonce in your life. This is the place to do that.

Steve's has great prices for some of the best coffee in Tempe. The space is warmly decorated and inviting, perfect for an after-dinner cup of coffee with friends.  They make their own food and pastries here every day as well. Try their brioche!

I like the coffee here much better than anywhere on Mill or on Campus (though not as much as Cartel, which is a bit further of a walk when you're at ASU). The food is alright, it can be a bit pricey, but it seems like they've also tweaked their prices a bit recently. Plus, local musicians like to play here, which is great.   I haven't ever experienced any snobbiness from the staff here actually, and I've been here quite a few times, and I am not really a regular. Overall, Three Roots is pretty rad. The only gripe I have... and it may seem petty, is the outdoor seating. The patio furniture is just kind of an eyesore. Some nicer stuff that doesn't look like it's going to blow away during the next breeze would be awesome. Also, it's unfortunate that the patio is so close to Mill, sometimes it can get too loud to really even hold a conversation. I'm a smoker so I sit outside a lot, but this is one place where I'd rather hang out in the cafe. It's a lot purtier in there, anyway.  Highlight: Walk or ride your bike here for breakfast.

I love PSC. Known colloquially as "SANDWHICH SHOP!!!" it's like an oasis in the drunken wasteland of 3 AM Old Town. PSC is open 24 hours, and any restaurant in Phoenix that is such gets an automatic 3 stars in my book, no matter how abysmal their service/food is.  Luckily, the sandwiches here are great. And after a few dozen cocktails, they are absolute perfection. Not to say that this is purely "drunk food." It's probably not. I think PSC's food is legit, and I hope that they don't get pigeon-holed into that category, but I haven't ever really been here in the day so I'm not really sure how I would react to the place in the sunlight. But if you couldn't already tell from the previous reviews, this place gets rushed by the drunks when the surrounding bars close at 2. It can get PACKED in here. Claustrophobia-inducing, fire-code-violation packed in the insatiable lust for roast beef and provolone. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but biting into a piping hot, mastercrafted 9th Street (spinach, roasted peppers, and cheese) makes it all worth while. Yes it does.   Highlight: PSC is the only place that provides an arena for the crowds of BS West, Saddle Ranch, and Axis/Radius to mingle together in intoxicated greasebomb love.

Nothing but great experiences each time I've visited The Roosevelt. I stopped in the other night with some friends and it was no exception. The house was packed, the beer was flowing, and the dimly lit nooks and crannies each held their own conversations. it's a magical time of night.   There is still not enough seating (I am always the one to stand as I'm the tallest) and you will be banished to Dante's seventh level of hell if you attempt (you will be stopped) to swipe a chair from the bar.  The beer and wine selection is usually provoking. The North Coast stuff is always a comfortable starter, but I also love seeing what's on the rotating tap, and it's almost always good.

Essence is SO my type of place. The coffee is great, (particularly their iced coffee) and in my experience the food has been consistently delicious. Essence is a perfect place for breakfast/brunch/lunch (but nothing later! They close early at 3 pm.)   I would certainly say Essence is one of the best bakeries in Tempe. But it's absolutely a destination for their food, as well. For example, their Quiche Lorraine is pretty much perfection. Getting a good consistency with quiche can be tricky. But here, they're not gloopy or runny, yet not too firm or overcooked. Although I wish it were a little bigger. (And not just because it's so good--it's a bit on the dainty side.)   And let's please not forget about their baked goods. Yes, the macaroons (the real kind) are heavenly. Paired with a latte or cup of iced coffee, they are divine.   Ultimately, Essence is good because their ingredients are always fresh and of high quality. This is apparent in the first bite of anything you taste.

No other company I've had to deal with has been more inept than Qwest. Because our apartment complex is forcing us to use Qwest over Cox, we have no choice. We had a problem with our internet connection (surprise surprise) and spent over half an hour trying to pull up the account. Not only can Qwest not provide its services, it can't even maintain a consistent system for keeping track of its customers.   "I'm sorry sir, are you sure that's your address? We have no account on record for that address or phone number."  Uh. Do you not send us bills in the mail every month to this address? No record of our names, of our address, our phone numbers, nothing. And yet we pay them every month. Like bitches. We finally tracked down our account number and got the problem resolved by "Fred" over the phone.  Cox isn't a shining example of quality customer service either, but compared to the barnyard bonanza that is Qwest... I can't wait til we can switch over.

This the best place to take your vehicle if you prefer honest, straightforward mechanics who speak to you like a human being and don't treat you like your car is on the verge of exploding on the freeway UNLESS you get that $1,500 part fixed today.   I've been here a few times, and Gene is extremely communicative, detailed, and honest. You will not get taken advantage of or sold anything. Plus, they have the cheapest towing service around for when you can't actually "drive" your car into the mechanic.  Can't imagine going anywhere else.

I would give B.O.B. a 3-star rating, but that extra star comes as a direct result of the amazing selection of draft beers this place has. Their lineup features lots of domestic specialty brews and a surprising amount of other stuff available. Plus, since they rotate the selection so much, the bartenders are happily willing to give samples of what's new, which is the way it should be. I got no puzzled faces, groans or stinginess.   The service we had was attentive and the food was good. My friend ordered the "interactive" guacamole and the waitress came out and made it right then and there at the table. Overall, I was impressed! Beer lovers beware, untold deliciousness awaits you inside, beneath the ski decor and deers' heads.

BFM, in its amorphous identity, seems to now be a venue. I recently saw Yacht and Washed Out perform here. There was no cover (we purchased tickets ahead of time) and I was pleased to see that getting a drink at the bar was no longer a thirty minute bartering process. Franziskaner and Optimator on tap (although no more boots?! Who ruined it for the rest of us?) and more efficient servers behind the counter were great to see.   It's such a weird ass, unique place. I love it.

Tempe Marketplace is Desert Ridge's bigger, huskier, more intense yet slightly dumber brother. Made by the same development company, the layout of the place is similar (but worse) to D.R. with "The District" in the center, and the big stores surrounding it, separated by a vast impenetrable wasteland of parking lot. The District is an admirable concept I think. It's like a traditional mall but at least there's an attempt to move forward on it by making it outdoors? That's cool when it's nice out, but when it's 139 degrees out, the misters are in full amazon jungle force. The biggest gripe I have about the place is the layout of the place. The design is horrendous.   First of all, it just irritates me how the giant flashy signs face the 202, beckoning unknowing, random passersby to come shop there. Meanwhile, the entire shopping center's fat ass is planted firmly and stubbornly toward Tempe, the city it's supposed to represent. The drive past Tempe Marketplace on Rio Salado features a glorious view of the backs of Pier One and Old Navy and Target's loading docks. It's ugly. And most importantly, it didn't need to be designed that way.   Secondly, this place is one of the least pedestrian friendly strip malls in Tempe. Which is shitty because it's also one of the newest. Our planning and development should be propelling forward, not going backward. Does the developer know anything about the city it's in? Does it represent that? If you're going to create a mega structure like Tempe Marketplace, shouldn't it at least vaguely represent the qualities of its city? Tempe Marketplace is impossible to walk around when you're outside The District. If you wanted to, for example, walk from BevMo to Pier One, you must first throw yourself into a the middle of  a harrowing situation. There are no well designed sidewalks or walkways across the meandering, confusing road systems. You must just walk across the parking lot. Between the speeding frat boys in Mustangs and the SUV driving soccer moms who've gotta get to Sport Chalet FAST and have no time for pedestrians, Tempe Marketplace simply does not account for two major facts about its environment, and thus its consumer: people will be walking, and people will be riding bikes. And it didn't need to be designed that way.   And then there's Big Brother-esque advertisements that are going on via loud speaker all the time. What's up with that? I love the one with the most anglo sounding chick they can find harping about how great "San Feleep's" cafe is. You can't even pronounce the place's name right and you're doing an ad for it? But the music is hilarious. Sometimes it sounds like a gay club circa 1992 out there. It's like all Whitney and Technotronic. Makes me grin.   The good thing is that the Orbit (Earth) goes through T.M. The bad thing is that the Light Rail should have been a bit more accessible. Other than that, hopefully Tempe Marketplace can be an example of what not to do for other developers of similar places in the future.

The reviews speak for themselves, but for those of us who want a real cup of coffee, not a bullshit sugarfest, this is the place to go. I'm not really the type who chooses to hang out in an industrial garage for hours on end, but when the coffee is this good I suppose one's surroundings falter in relevance.

I retract my previous statements about Cartel's ambiance. The "garage" has grown on me. Not only do I not mind hanging out here, I love it! I find myself coming back time and time again. It's a combination of the location, the baristas, and some of the best coffee in Tempe. If I could kiss you Cartel, I would. And I'd make it wet.

I really enjoyed the food here. We stopped in for a casual dinner after being highly recommended. I left happy, and WAY more full than I had anticipated. All those light, airy dhosas are deceptively filling.  Another reviewer was on point by saying that this spot isn't really a restaurant, but more of an eatery or dhosa shop. You order at a counter, take a seat, and your food is brought out to you. Pitchers of water are self-serve and there is of course a soda fountain. There is also a chutney bar where you can explore to your heart's content. We brought a sample of each back to the table. Each were delicious and fresh.   I got the palak paneer, which was delicious. My friend ordered one of the giant table-sized dhosas, of which they were happy to tone down the spice at her request. All in all, everything was great. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the plastic... everything. Our food was served in dixie bowls and all the silverware was plastic. It sort of felt like we were camping. The space is clean and bright, I think some real dishes and silverware would really round this place out. At any rate, I will be back.

This place is a trip. Here's the rundown on "F.G." It used to be a sports bar with not-so-hottie waitresses, Coors flowing like water, D-Backs all over the place. Then one day, POOF! It's now a gay bar! Why? Who knows. But it is.   We went to check it out one night just to see what the hell was going on. Inside, it still looks like a sports bar. There's everything you would expect to find in a typical sports bar and nothing you would expect to find in a typical gay bar. Except, the big screen TVs that once hosted Cardinals' games were NOW showing a commercial for "Guys Gone Wild" and playing some show from Logo. After it started getting less and less likely that it was just some "weird awkward scene on the TV that would pass" and more and more likely that this channel was all male all the time, the guys at the table behind us started getting confused.   One of them asked, "What kind of place IS this?!"  My friend responded, "You do know you're at a gay bar, right?"  They had no idea. Their reactions ranged from sheer terror to amusement all in the span of like 3 seconds. It was weird. Finally one of them asked, "But, are we welcome here?"  To which my friend responded, "Well that's up to you..." They were uncomfortable and left a few minutes later. (But one of them was dancing outside the window as they left?)  I don't know, it was kind of entertaining. But come on, F.G.! If you're going to be a gay bar, you need to thoroughly gay it up. The Budweiser posters need to come down. So does the Kathy Ireland shit. Do something. Fantasy Grill needs to get an identity and create something out of it. Right now, it doesn't know where or what it is, and neither do the people that are there. Everyone's just confused and it's not because they're drunk. This place might be able to have potential, and the sports-bar-to-gay-bar transition is admirable, but let's seriously reevaluate our situation. That being said, I'm keeping my eye on you, F.G.  Highlight: The bartender left before we did.

The "F.G." has apparently closed down... For good. I can't help but feel a little bit bad. I really did want to see it make the "full transformation." But maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Ah well.

Why had I never been here before? I had dinner here after a serious WEEK of craving some good Thai food. The Elephant did not disappoint, I really enjoyed my visit.   The interior of the restaurant is tasteful, well-maintained and spacious. The layout sort of wraps around a semi-circle, with the bar keenly separated in the back, attached to a cozy patio. I'm the type of person that always notices the music playing in a store or restaurant. The music choice in here was pretty interesting; a good deal of '90s hip hop, including the famous Cops' theme song, Inner Circle's "Bad Boys." Lots of volume and bass going on as well, it was really unexpected, but kind of awesome.   I usually try out a new restaurant by ordering something basic. I got the Pad Thai at the "Hot" level. They didn't go easy, their "Hot" level was nice and spicy. The food was delicious. Fresh, vibrant, and full of flavor. None of it was soggy or too salty. My partner in crime ordered the Spicy Eggplant, which also featured fresh, well-prepared ingredients. Eggplant is sort of hit or miss with me, but this was cooked to perfection.   The menu is extensive and has lots of interesting options. Including a dish called "Crazy Beef Salad." I will absolutely be back to Thai Elephant very soon.

I really, really like SideBar. Perched above a Pei Wei/Starbucks duplex behind an odd neighborhood, this place has an excellent beer selection and is small enough to be intimate yet still packs in a crowd. SideBar is dressed in modern and upscale furnishings but still maintains its neighborhood lounge identity.   Every time I come here with friends, it seems like we always get pleasantly toasted. I'm not sure if it's the overflowing glasses of Unibroue or the creative house cocktails, but there's just something about the vibe of SideBar that works with me.   Two minor notes: first, the music can be a little weird. I think they were playing Sublime at one point? Secondly, an outdoor patio would round this place out to five stars. But, given the architecture of the building I don't think this is possible. I suppose for now, we smokers will happily crowd on the landing and entertain ourselves with the colorful characters that hang out at that bus stop on 7th Ave.

So, I thought I could pick up some things for school since the campus bookstore was closed. "Just a few notebooks, they're cheap," I says to myself.   But uh, here at CVS, I actually laughed aloud at what they were selling this stuff for. Paper was five dollars and UP.   First you kill Sahara, now you want TEN DOLLARS for a spiral-bound notebook?!  Die.

I work near here, so it's the most convenient place to get coffee when you're hungover and already 5 minutes late. But every time I go in I wonder why I had.  Starbucks' coffee isn't really that good for the most part, but I've definitely had some good baristas that know how to make a good latte. The baristas here however, are obnoxious teenagers who don't know/care what they're doing. It's dirty and hectic, and they're always throwing empty pitchers around and sighing heavily at the STRESS of it all. You probably won't be addressed for a few minutes when approaching the register, as the girl will be frantically stirring some frappuccino mix and mumbling to herself about how much she hates her life.  At least the coffee's been hot every time I've been in here. But guys. Relax a little.

The interior of Lola Coffee is beautiful. It is all one room, (even behind the counter) and neatly sectioned by the arrangement of the furniture rather than walls or building floorplan. This is an expert way of dealing with the existing design of the space, rather than tearing up floors and knocking down walls. Furthermore, the (from what I could tell) original ceiling support beams of the building were also left intact, painted, and incorporated as part of the overall design in a very elegant manner.   All in all, I was very impressed at the interior design at Lola. Even though it's a bit like a Eurway showroom, everything is well placed and cohesive.   Beyond the visual aesthetics, my coffee was great. I ordered just a plain latte, which was precisely what I was hoping for. There was an assortment of  pastries at the counter, which from what I understand are the work of Sweet Pea Bakery. I tried the cinnamon coffee cake, which was delicious. The crumble topping on the coffee cake was rich and crusty, and the cake was moist and tart, almost carrot cake-like.   It's obvious that the baristas here are still trying to get in the groove of the flow of service and developing a system for taking orders/serving food/making drinks, etc. But this is definitely related to the place barely being open a week. That being said, I was quite impressed with Lola and foresee the cafe doing very well. I'm going to be back soon.

The waffles... yes. The chicken... YES!   I had the Tre-Tre and my friend had the Lil' C.  Drinks are served in mason jars so you don't need refills very often, and everything comes with huge mounds of butter and in generous portions. Lolo's does not skimp. The waffles are golden brown and have a cinnamony, home-cooked element. If my waffles were just a tad on the crispier side they would have been perfect.   The fried chicken is pretty amazing. I don't claim to really know much (or anything) about good friend chicken, but I know this is among the best I can remember having. Perfectly seasoned, juicy, and again, non-skimpy. I finished all mine and even stole some from my friend's plate. Whoopsie.   Service was fine, the kid who was our server could pick up the pace next time for a better tip. Also, my check was returned to me cardless. I guess he accidentally dropped my card behind the counter and couldn't find it for a few minutes. Alright.  I'm going back soon.

Anyone who's anyone in Tempe knows that Tops Liquor is the go-to local liquor store, ready to fulfill your every alcoholic desire. Naturally, its spawn-child of a bar, cleverly named "Taste of Tops" would be just as precious. Right? Right.   Taste of Tops has a simple, unpretentious vibe, and is a fresh addition to the businesses in this part of town. This is a beer drinker's paradise for sure, with a consistent selection of good brews on tap. There is always something new and interesting to try (and samples are happily offered). The wine list is straightforward and well-crafted, featuring inexpensive, "more bang for your buck" selections. As for the beer selection, you want it - they got it.  I can't wait to make this place a regular hangout.

I vowed not to review H&M until after the first month of chaos. The first two times I visited, that's exactly what it was. And it's to be expected, of course. The first time I went, we didn't even bother trying to get into the line for the fitting room. I just tried things on right out on the floor. Despite the mobs, the checkout lines still moved at an efficient pace, and the staff was collected and helpful.   After my visit today, the store had cooled down, things were much more tidy, people weren't slaughtering each other for the last flannel button-up, and there was a general vibe of togetherness. Even though it was a Monday afternoon, the store was at a normal level of business and the staff was upbeat and on top of things. There was no wait to get into the fitting room, nor to check out.   The selection is not bad. The menswear section is a smaller portion of the store, of course, but it is not small. I was expecting the worst: a tiny corner relegated to graphic tees and jeans. That was not the case at all. Sorry for doubting you, H&M. The selection of clothes in the store for this season was not amazing, but not bad. The right selection of  Fall/Winter clothing can be difficult to market in Phoenix, especially upon opening the very first store in the state.   I am pretty much guaranteed to find something that I would wear at any given H&M location. With their prices and the close proximity to where I live, I will undoubtedly be here a lot. I'm excited to see how this store rolls out future collections. My advice: a bit more accessories (for both men and women) and I'd like to see some of the dressier menswear.    Fiiiiinally!

I love Eddies. After a long night of drinking at only the most prestigious of watering holes, there is nothing more luxurious than stumbling home at 2, 3, 4, or even 5 am and having a delicious jalapeño pizza from Eddies delivered straight to your door. Trust me, I do it all the time.  Or you could get vegan options that aren't too bad for the price. But at 4 am, you know you want that jalapeño.

We stopped in here after a brisk walk from the light rail and were immediately greeted, even before stepping in. Inside, it was busy. Virtually every table was sat and the bar was full. Maybe it had to do with the building itself, but there was nothing about TMI that made it seem new or recently-opened to me. The vibe felt like it could have been here for years.  Although we were only out for drinks, the food looked really tempting. I remember seeing the Coronado Coney on the menu and rethinking having dinner #2. I skipped it, but I'll be back, don't you worry.   I had some draft Nimbus and noticed that their entire draft selection was either local or Westcoast, which later was explained to us as no accident. Some Dogfish Head, Stone, or some imports would be delicious additions, but it's not like you can't go anywhere else and get it.  After finally making our way to the bar, we chatted with the owners and tried a previously mentioned luscious dessert/drink made with an imperial porter and raspberry vodka. The owner was playing some oldschool Outkast from his laptop behind the bar, and I sampled an IPA out of Colorado (?) that I definitely want next time.   I'll be back soon.

Really glad to see this place open up, as since I work right in this area, I'm constantly running to the Einstein's next door for coffee. The coffee there is fine, but it's always kind of a weird, tense shitshow in there. I was glad to see that the baristas in Hazelrock were not fronting the  typical coffee-chain overhyped, aggressively sunny demeanor and just spoke like real humans. Thank you.  The interior is spacious, open, and extremely clean and polished. Great care was taken to design the menu boards and they're packed with information about their proprietary beans: tasting notes, production information, growing regions (today it was Brazil, Ethiopia and Cameroon). I personally was thrilled to see this, and excited about the prospect of choosing a bean (I went with the Ethiopian).  After ordering, I waited a few minutes and was given an iced coffee when I had wanted hot. The barista was apologetic and mentioned that she "just assumed" and I admitted that I didn't specify, either. However, I do think that if you don't specify, it should be hot. Isn't that the default? At any rate, I just ended up going with the iced coffee since I was in a hurry (and anyone who knows iced coffee knows that Ethiopian beans are the best for iced anyway.) No big deal. The coffee itself was great, by the way. Bright, vibrant notes, smooth and intense. Yes.   When it comes down to it, all the high-concept, coffee-as-the-new-wine, making-the-gourmet-the-norm is essential, and there is a market for it, and it's necessary to raise the bar and lift us from the depths of the bottom of Einstein's brown-stained coffee urn, but you also have to be able to take orders, and make drinks fast and not have your baristas short circuit and blow up when someone orders "just a decaf, please". I think the real mark of excellence in coffee comes from a certain subtlety: exceptional coffee that doesn't need to be dressed up and called out by a long list of pseudo-Italian terms. Good coffee can be served black, as-is, and stand on its own. And no matter how you market it, if it's a good roast, people will notice.
