Mmmmm the food was so good! The chips, salsa and bean dip provided in the beginning were plentiful and replenished without even having to ask for it! That's a big plus because a lot of places almost seem reluctant to give you more chips and salsa.   I had the two enchilada plate. The lettuce and tomato salad that came on it seemed fresher than other places, and the rice was good (no beans for me). I went with a party of 7 and everyone else's dishes looked very good and there were definitely no complaints from anyone!  It was my niece's birthday, and the servers all assembled and sang happy birthday with a big sundae for the birthday girl. Our server was named Caesar, and he did a great job. So the service was top-notch!  I'll definitely want to come back!

Not sure if anyone else was able to use their Groupon here, but I wasn't able to...that was a bummer. Our neighbor super-hyped us about Buono's and highly recommended this place so when I saw a Groupon for it, I bought it.   But when we went for lunch one Saturday, there was a sign on the window saying they were not accepting Groupons. So I had to notify Groupon for a refund--that took a few days but I eventually got my refund processed. I think at least a few people had contacted them about Buono's because I received a mass email from Groupon apologizing for Buono's Groupon not being valid anymore and I also received a personalized message from the Groupon customer support shortly after.  Anyways, on to the food. We started off with spicy honey wings as an appetizer. DELICIOUS! The sauce was tangy and flavorful (although not spicy enough, but we have a high tolerance) and the wings were gone in a flash. We had high hopes for the pizza...  I had a mushroom/spinach/tomato slice and a sausage/mushroom Sicilian slice. Well, I had actually ordered the veggie slice to be on a white-garlic sauce style, but the sauce wasn't prepared yet (boo) so I had to get it in the traditional style.   The mushroom/spinach/tomato slice was very sad-looking. The mushrooms were the canned kind!!! Blasphemy!!! And the amount of veggies was pretty skimpy. The sausage/mushroom slice was not my cup of tea, but I don't know if I'm just not fond of the Sicilian style.   My husband ordered the calzone and was veeerrrrryyyy disappointed with it. The crust wasn't good and overcooked to the point of being rock-hard so it was kind of a pain to eat. Usually he scarfs down his calzones quickly (it's his first choice at italian places), but we left with 3/4 of the calzone intact and I ended up having to toss it when I was cleaning out the fridge because he didn't eat the leftovers.   All in all, it wasn't a great meal. But we really did like the wings so maybe when we have a craving we may order them from Buonos for takeout.

I'm giving this place 5 stars because I'm a sucker for mom-and-pop places. An elder Japanese couple runs this restaurant (apparently since 1983!!), with no help. Just the two of them bussing and cooking and taking orders.   For all the previous reviews who complain about the lack of fawning service....REALLY? The elder man handles all the tables by himself. The wife stays in the back. This couple works side by side, all day every day. They make straightforward good food. No frills. Don't nitpick--try to do what they do all year round and see where your priorities are.   Anyways, on to the food:  Gyoza: Very good! Perfectly pan-fried, flavorful, and not too oily.  Curry Katsu over Rice: Delicious! I wish they put the pork katsu on top of the curry so that it doesn't lose some of the crisp sitting in the sauce. But it was delicious! The curry was thick and the proportion to the rice was perfect.   Tonkotsu Ramen: Definitely did not come with the typical ramen toppings like wakame, charsiu and bamboo. It came topped with Chinese cabbage and chicken. It was almost more like Chinese noodle soup haha. If I were to judge it as a ramen, it wouldn't be good. But as a noodle/soup dish, it was good.  Soft Shell Crab roll: Okay, sushi is definitely not their strength. I would not order another roll from here. There was too much mayo (the presence of mayo was already odd), the sushi rice was not the right consistency, and the nori was soggy.  The inari that came with my tonkotsu ramen tasted a little odd as well. It's ok, they have plenty of other things I need to try on the menu!  If this review was based purely on food, I'd give it 3.5 stars. But I really appreciated how hard-working the couple works! So 5 stars all the way!

My favorite pho place!  I love coming here to study and have a good quick bowl of pho. Their portions are great and their prices are the best. Service is great as well -- every time I go I overhear the servers all chummy with their tables, so clearly they have many regulars, and I am definitely one of them now!  I love their string beans with ground pork as well, a big whole plate of them for just $5.95.   One odd thing though, for the past couple of months, they have not had jalapenos to serve with the pho. Instead, they use little thai chilis. Not sure why they stopped using jalapenos but in the off-chance they read these reviews, please start buying jalapenos again!! lol

ALWAYS PAY CASH HERE.  This review is not about the food at Filibertos. I love their food and have had many meals from different locations--I need my Filibertos Fix at least once every couple of weeks. Their portions are big and grossly delicious.   This review is rather about a shady credit card charge at this particular location.  I drove through, ordered my usual #16 (2 fish tacos with rice and beans), and pulled up to pay. $7.26, as always, awesome. I gave them my card, they swiped, I signed a receipt, got one back, drove off, life is wonderful.  2 days later, I'm checking my credit card charges and I see a charge for $9.26 from Filibertos. WTF? Thankfully, I found my receipt from that purchase. Oddly enough, the receipt they gave me listed that I had paid with $7.26 in "Cash"--it wasn't a credit card charge slip. I should have looked at what they gave me, but who really does? I just assumed it was a credit card charge slip, crammed it into some orifice in my car and drove off.   I don't really feel like printing out my credit card statement and arguing with them over $2, especially since this is the closest Filibertos to where I live and I don't want them spitting in my food if they see that it's me in the drive-thru. So the bastards will get away with overcharging my card this time.   But I definitely did just want to warn you all about this shady business.   I know I will definitely be paying cash for my meals here now. And counting my change.

I went for a dinner with a few friends on a Friday night around 8pm and we were one of two tables. It was a perfectly good dinner, with friendly staff waiting on us. One of the ladies was trying a bit too hard to upsell more expensive dishes, so that was a bit too obvious on her part but it wasn't too big of a deal.  Lemon Chicken - my husband's favorite. He seemed to like it well enough so I think it was good!  Double Tofu Delight - Fried tofu arranged on the border of the plate with steamed tofu in brown sauce in the middle. Pretty tasty!  Steamed Tilapia - Seemed a bit pricey, $24 for a roughly 2lb tilapia. But I guess they have to markup market prices to make a profit.  Honey Walnut Shrimp - Good, but the breading was a bit inconsistent among the shrimp. But you can't really do much wrong to this dish :P Yum...  All in all, it was a good dinner and we left pretty content. We'll have to come back for dim sum.

DIM SUM REVIEW:  So my dinner here previously wasn't too bad, but the weekday dim sum I had here was horrendous. I was pretty embarrassed--brought some co-workers here for their first dim sum experience ever and I ended up apologizing for how bad the food was. They ended up ordering regular lunch entrees after trying their first couple dim sum items (I could have died of embarassment).  Siumai were cold and hard as rocks, ha gao very dry and chewy-skinned, charsiubao filling was odd-tasting, etc...we came at about 1230 so it wasn't off-peak lunch hours or anything. The selection of dim sum was dismal overall as well.   So for regular entrees, this place is ok. But if you're looking for dim sum, check out China King or Phoenix Palace just a few blocks away.

It's your standard international supermarket! Has everything I need and it's very conveniently located for me. Produce and meat doesn't stay fresh though as long as the same products bought at Safeway or Frys for example, so you definitely have to use them within 2-3 days max of buying otherwise you've wasted your money.   I think Mekong's prices are a bit cheaper, but we're not talking a huge difference. Leelee's is closer to me so I come here much more frequently.  Awful news though: they have discontinued their standard 10% off every purchase! Nooooooooo :(

It's your run-of-the-mill casino, I guess. But there was a lack of Keno machines, which doesn't sit well with my husband. There is also no card room, which doesn't sit well with either of us. So we probably won't be back very often since there's not much else I like to do besides play poker. lol Talking Stick, here I come!  (FYI, people posting under Casino Arizona talking about poker games...they're confusing it with Talking Stick down the road)

Their chips and salsa are the best I've had! The chips come with a bottle of regular salsa and hot salsa, and they are generous to refill anything you need! The regular salsa is chock full of tomatoes, onions, cilantro...yum....mix in some of the hotter salsa on your plate and it's perfect!   I had their 2 chicken enchilada plate, no beans extra rice. It was really good, although it was cubes of chicken, rather than shredded chicken which I'm used to. Tasty, nonetheless, lol I'm just being overly picky :P Their rice was cooked well, and it came with a nice little side of lettuce and tomatoes.  All in all, a great plate of food! It was a tiny bit pricey...around $13.  But I really enjoyed my food! Service was great. My sister-in-law and I went on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm, and there were only a few other tables. They don't have horchata though :(

The food is typical of any YC's Mongolian Grill, but the reason why I'm writing this review is because of the great service at this location.  There is a staff member (server? not sure what to call her) named Janet that is just so helpful. While you're in line making your bowl, she'll ask you if you'd like a sauce prepared, she'll recommend sauces for your taste, etc.  She helps you bring things to your table, and checks in on you during the meal. Awesome service!

ARE THEY OPEN AGAIN YET?  I swear it's been forever since I've seen they closed for the summer. Anyways, hope they are so we can resume going. My husband's family has been going to this place for his entire 30 years of existence so it would be blasphemous to give this place less than 5 stars for the sense of tradition it holds in their family.   There's not anything I could quite say about their food or decor to set it apart from other Mexican restaurants...but it's just El Charro! You either love it with all your heart or...you're indifferent to the place! lol   One thing's for sure, you always get your food FAST. They have their system down pat in the back, and I've seen the same servers there for the three years I've been coming to this place. Ryan's seen the same servers since he was a little kid! So they must treat their servers well.  El Charro's will always be a family favorite. It's an oldie but a goodie!

We've had two pugs neutered and one pug spayed here -- all 3 procedures went without a hitch! Other than being a little bit sleepy the rest of the day, all pugs were back to normal the next day like nothing had happened!  Their prices are MUCH more reasonable than all the other quotes we'd gotten. Paid about $80 for the neuters...a little more for the spay i think but not by much.

Wooooo this was a pricey dinner, but it was worth it!   I ordered a Cucumber Collins, with cucumber vodka, lemon juice and soda water and it was yummy! I wish I knew where to get cucumber vodka so I could make it myself at home.   I received 50% off my appetizer with a Yelp Check-in (woohoo!)--we ordered the spinach artichoke dip. Wow, it was very different than any other spinach artichoke dip I've ever ordered! That's something I order very frequently everywhere because I just love it. Usually it's a cheesy and delicious gloop in a baking dish with sparse spinach and artichoke chunks. But the spinach and artichoke dip here was chock FULL of spinach and artichoke! It was a wonderful change! Don't get me wrong, I love my cheesy gloopy alternative versions, but I just thought that's how it was always prepared :P Monti's dip seemed to be a batch of fresh spinach sauteed with artichoke hearts with a little cream added to the mix. Wonderful! That was a great start to the meal. Oh, also the rosemary bread served in the beginning was so good and I had way too many pieces before even eating anything else.   I ordered the 16oz prime rib rare with chipotle mac n cheese and a baked potato...wooooow. The rare prime rib was perfectly cooked, and the au jus served with it was delicious. *wipes drool from mouth* I had a little corner of the prime rib, most of my potato and most of the chipotle mac n cheese left at the end of the meal which made for a great extra meal! I definitely had way too much dip and bread before my meal lol...  We will definitely be back whenever we have a steak craving and we're feeling a bit fancy!

If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Also, as Paolo did below, I would like to thank Yelpers for helping me decide on a place to take my car. This place was the highest rated repair shop I could find, and there is GOOD REASON for it :)  Anyways, I got into an accident earlier this year and was struggling whether to scrap or repair my car. I decided to repair it, and Jeremy Black and his team did an amazing job. Jeremy was so polite and patient with me (I asked him a lot of questions) and he would text me updates on my car.   My husband and I have odd work schedules that don't allow us to get to this shop during their hours and Jeremy even had our car dropped off at my husband's work! He was even willing to drive all the way up to 101 and Raintree to my office to pick me up so I could get my car! Talk about service and accomodation!  It's been a rough patch for our cars -- my husband's truck also went caput and needed a major repair. Jeremy sorted it all out for us. Then a couple months after my car had been in, I brought it to Jeremy again to get new tires. He had already quoted me a very fair price for all 4 new tires, but when the time came to pay, he gave me back $30! He could have easily kept it and I would have been more than happy with the price but he was very honest.  I will always bring my cars to Jeremy as long as I live in this area and I highly recommend him to everyone! Honest, highly competent, reasonably-priced and respectful -- qualities I didn't think possible to find all in one car repair shop!

My husband and I decided to elope to Vegas last August :) Ryan absolutely wanted an Elvis singer to serenade us during the ceremony, and Graceland Chapel caught my eye (well, my name is also Grace...that helped in my decision too lol)   I had no problem making my reservation, and everything went without a hitch. The chapel was very cute and quaint, and the ceremony was simple and beautiful. Our Elvis singer was A-MAAAAAAAAA-ZING! So tall, so Elvis-ey, so sparkly--everything Ryan and I wanted. He sang "Amazing Grace," (of course) "I Want You, I Need You, I Love You" and "Love Me Tender."  The ceremony was fairly priced and our minister was very warm and friendly.   We really enjoyed our experience at the Graceland Wedding Chapel. It was simple and intimate--just what we wanted.

Having lived in cities with amazing dim sum, I am pretty desperate to find a place here in Phoenix I could go to. This was not a good first attempt....  We went to dim sum on a Thursday lunch around 1:45pm.   There was only one cart. The woman said there was usually one more cart with the fried stuff, but they weren't running it at this time. So normally there would be 2. I thought, not a good start but it's ok I mainly like the steamed dim sum anyway. We got everything they had in the cart excluding short ribs and beef balls, which I typically don't order anyways. Here's what we had:  Siumai - no shrimp, spongy and bloated,  weird tasting. When you cut into it, it was colorless--just this pale brown blob. It tasted like...nothing? It was the weirdest thing. I had to ask for chili sauce just to have a flavor.  I swear you can judge a place's dim sum by their siumai--it's the staple dish! So of course everything else followed suit.  Bean Curd Wrap -- Isn't this supposed to be filled with seafood and vegetables? Easily unwrappable in a light broth? Nope. More colorless pork. The sauce it was in was CONGEALED. Like a weird gravy.   Ma Tsang -- This sticky rice wrap was probably the best part of the dim sum. It seemed over-steamed though. When I unwrapped it, the rice just slid out, and it was overly moist. Usually when you unwrap one, you gotta scrape it off the leaf. The flavors were there at least. I had a bone in mine though. But other than that I could at least manage to enjoy it.  Chicken feet -- Overboiled skin and not very flavorful sauce. worst part is one of them still had the NAILS on. I definitely did not want to see that.  Char Shiu Bao -- The bun had a good texture. The char siu filling seemed candied and overly sweet and the pork was dry.    Meh.

Ah, I have found an acceptable place in Phoenix for dim sum. It makes my move here at least a little more bearable :P   The variety was good. The dim sum carts came around frequently. If I were to compare the dim sum to my favorite dim sum places (in other cities), it would be only mediocre, but for Phoenix, it is great.   My favorite thing I had there was their Ma Tsang. It was the right consistency and flavoured well. Their look funn was also good. Their chicken feet lacked in flavor and didn't have enough sauce! Their congee was fine--not enough century egg though for me :P Their ro po gao (radish cake) was pretty good--came out a little cold though. I wish they had a cart where they fried the entrees to order for you like in other dim sum places. Their siu mai and ha gao were standard, as well as the xiao long bao (soup dumplings). I was impressed that they did have to hu hua (don't know how to describe this in english...sweet tofu dessert/soup?), and it was really good!  There was one hilariously bitter woman who just barked at everyone who wanted something from her cart. She was exceptionally grumpy lol. She seriously looked like she hated the world, herself and her life. Other than her, the other cart ladies were very nice. The manager was very welcoming and very smile-y too.    I will definitely be back. Glad there is at least some decent dim sum in Phoenix :)

Every time we go see a movie at the Pollack Theaters, we always leave plenty of time beforehand for a dinner at Yupha's. We love our Thai food and Yupha's is one of my two favorite Thai places in the valley (the other being Thai Spices in Mekong).   I always get Pad Thai every time I go to Thai restaurants...I really wish I could try more things but I can never stray from Pad Thai! Arrrgh. Anyways, I love the Pad Thai here but one unfortunate thing is the heat fluctuates each time we come.  The first time, I got hot and oooo-weeee my bowel movements hurt the next day! I ordered a step lower on the heat scale the next time, and I barely even felt a singe of heat. So it's kind of hit or miss if the level of heat is there that I want, but regardless the rest of the taste of the dish is the same and it's great.   My husband thankfully changes up his order each time we go so I can try more of their dishes. Everything he's ordered has been good.   The ambience and timeliness of the food is also a plus -- we don't have to panic about not making our movie on time because we're usually in and out in 40minutes tops.   Yupha's will always be a staple of our movie date nights.

To the Yelp-powers that made my previous review for Yupha's the ROTD, thank you so much!  Update on Yupha's awesomeness: When I wrote the last review, I had only had dinner. Since then, I have gone to Yupha's for lunch and it's even more amazing! Their lunch specials are $7.99 and come with unlimited soup and salad bar that you can serve yourself at. The soup is a clear vegetable broth and the salad (kale, cabbage, etc -- super healthy) comes with cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots and onions as garnishes and they have a to-die-for peanut dressing. You can even do an unlimited soup and salad lunch for just $5.99.  I hope you all enjoy Yupha's as much as I do!!

Roy's sent out a promotional email with a $25 off coupon, so my husband and I went for our anniversary.    The food here just isn't as good as it is in the Roy's locations in Hawaii. I thought I might have been too picky the first time we visited this location a few months ago, or perhaps the kitchen was having an off-night, but our food this time around was even worse:   Hawaii Kai Style Beef Short Ribs: should have been savory and melt in your mouth. It was just ok. It was much better prepared on our last visit.  Side dish of Szechuan string beans: I  was appalled. It was a pile of steamed green beans -- that's it. When I asked the server, he checked with the kitchen and said they had sauteed the green beans in the Szechuan sauce. It clearly wasn't, but I asked if I could have some of the sauce on the side, so he brought some. The sauce was ok, but not really Szechuan. From what I could see it was just shoyu and chilipaste. Was pretty miffed I had to even pay for this.  Alaea Salt Crusted Bone in Ribeye - My husband ordered this. It was fine for a steak, but nothing great. The biggest disappointment was the Truffled bacon mac n cheese! It had zilch seasoning, had very little cheese sauce, and there was hardly any bacon. I'm someone who can get by without much seasoning, unlike Ryan who wants 10lbs of salt on everything, but even I thought it was waaaaay underseasoned.   Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake (forget the actual name on menu): The last time I was here, I commented that it was a bit chewy. I was hoping for a better one this time, but it was even worse. There was not much oozing of chocolate goodness unfortunately, and the cake was even harder/chewier than last time.  I think if you've never been to Roy's in Hawaii, the food is fine and you'll enjoy your meal here. But if you have been to Roy's in Hawaii, it will be a letdown. There is just no comparison!

I'm warning you already, I am very grumpy in this review. More than usual. I am a very lenient Yelper most of the time. This one isn't going to be a pretty one.  Oh man. I was really looking forward to this meal. Having to drive 30min for the highly-recommended Sushi Ken? It'd be worth it, right? I had even skipped lunch in the hopes to be famished and love every bite of the dinner even more than normal.  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( It was the worst Japanese food I've ever had.  I had the Beef Curry and Tonkatsu Ramen combination with a salad. The salad was colorless and wilted, and the dressing (I love Japanese dressing), was overly vinegar-tasting. The Beef Curry was ok, but I make better Japanese Curry at home using the curry cubes in the boxes sold at supermarkets.   The Tonkatsu Ramen....should not have been called such. The ramen tasted worst than instant ramen! It was mushy! There was no taste in the broth of marrow-y goodness. It was a salty, lifeless broth with shriveled bamboo shoots, too much wakame, and one measly thin slice of charsiu. I had about 4 bites and left the rest to die. I didn't even take it home to try to remedy it.  My husband had the Tempura Bowl and Shoyu Ramen combination with an Edamame side.The edamame was the grayest-green shade I'd ever seen. Frozen edamame from the supermarket looked better than that! His tempura bowl was bizarre...gone was the flaky, crunchy Panko breading. What was brought out was a glazy, weirdly crusted abomination that was overly sweet. I would like to dip my tempura myself, thank you very much. His Shoyu Ramen was terribly salty. My husband even likes things very salty, and he couldn't drink it. He also left 90% of his bowl untouched.   The only thing they didn't mess up was their California Roll, which is pretty impossible to mess up so thank goodness for that.   And the service? Terrible. Absolutely terrible. We were a table of 9, and they could have cared less. The 15% was already included in the bill, so maybe that's why they didn't even bother to try to be nice to us. The ladies were so mean! It looked like they just hated everyone they were serving! And usually Japanese waiters are SOOOOO nice. I know, cause I used to wait tables alongside co-workers who had just immigrated from Japan.  Funny thing is, the rest of the table really enjoyed their food. (Update: One of them messaged me after reading this review to tell me she actually didn't like the food...lol I guess my husband and I were not the only ones that didn't enjoy it) Nobody enjoyed the service though, I can assure you of that lol.

Crazy buffet had pretty decent food! It was better than I expected. It also helped that one of the servers (possibly a manager) LOVED my husband and kept coming over every 10min saying "Ryan, can I get you anything? Ryan, would you like more iced tea? Ryan, you're so lucky you have a beautiful wife (of course he gets points for flattery lol)" We were in a group of about 10, but he was seemed to only want to serve Ryan. Haha it was pretty funny.  The selection was good--standard fare. We were there for dinner so we had a TON of crab legs. Just that alone was worth the money. The sushi bar was good too--better sushi than I've seen at other buffet. They had unagi sushi too, which is usually kinda pricey, so it was generous of them to serve that.   They had a mongolian stir fry station where they would cook toppings you'd choose yourself. I didn't notice this until I was already at dessert, but other people at my table had gotten it and it looked really good.  The only dish I really couldn't eat was an alfredo shrimp pasta. It was pretty gross--I tasted mayo in it? Not a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a nice creamy cheesy sauce.   They had good desserts too, which is usually my least favorite part of a buffet. They had actual ice cream, instead of gross frozen yogurt. There was an ice cream freezer with 8 different buckets--I gnoshed on the oreo and butter pecan ice cream happily. They also had some good cheesecake, which complemented the ice cream really well.   All in all, I'd definitely go back!

I used to work at an office in a plaza across the street and I frequented this carneceria quite often. The reason why? $2.99 STREET TACO PLATE. WITH A SALSA AND GUACAMOLE BAR.   4 delicious street tacos...for $2.99? Getouttahere. Seriously, I really miss having this place as an option. I always get the tripe street tacos, but they also had carne asada and chicken. There are bins of salsa and guacamole in the fridge next to the drinks on the far right of the store. Oh, was I generous with myself everytime I ordered them. I would pile it sky high in my box and hope the cashier wouldn't open it and judge me. hahahah.  My tacos would be so full I could scrape off all the toppings and really make 8 tacos (the four tacos had double corn tortillas). Seriously. You could theoretically make 2 meals out of this.   They also have a huge variety of very reasonably-priced seasoned meats and entrees. But I only come for one thing. The tacos. Absolutely amazing. Thank you!!  Service was always friendly and they had a great variety of household goods, pantry items and a little grocery section. I usually didn't get anything other than the tacos though.  Really my biggest issue was having to bring cash to pay, because they require a $5 minimum for credit card and my $2.99 lunch was such a steal!!

This place has great food! The menu is SO long--you'll spend a good 10 min at least just going through all the pages, and you'd only be skimming. I was with a large group of people, and half the table ordered the family set.   I ordered the Fujian style noodles that came in a broth--it was delicious! I wolfed it down, as I did the red bean drink. I had never had a red bean drink before--I loved it so much I had to order another one to take home.  Also for take out, I ordered the Amoy noodles, Yang Chow Fried Rice and orange chicken. The fried rice and orange chicken was really good, but the Amoy noodles were lacking the tang I'm used to. I probably won't order the Amoy noodles again, but there are a TON more dishes from the menu that I'll be going back to try at Asian Cafe Express!  The service was also very prompt and nice. The food came out quickly, and the prices were more than reasonable! The portions are also generous. They closed at 9pm, but with our large group we were chatting away til 9:30pm. We didn't realize they were closed! They never rushed us and were very nice! We were taken aback when we walked out and saw the hours of operation, and definitely appreciated how kind they were.

LOOOOOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Every time I go shopping at LeeLee's for my groceries, I HAVE to order boba to go from here. I call in my order when I'm almost done with my shopping and just swing by, pick up my boba and I'm on my way home. Our standard order is the red bean slush with red bean and boba for me and a taro coconut slush with boba for my husband. It is such a wonderful treat for us and it's always consistently made.  I also am impressed with the people that work here. They are all very respectful, energetic, cheerful and efficient. Usually this isn't something I comment about in reviews, but whoever does the hiring here has a great eye for the right employees. This place has the same kind of employees as In-n-Out -- hypothetically if I ever owned a company and was looking to snipe young, eager, well-trained employees, I'd scout In-n-Out locations and this boba house. LOL that's a weird comment for a yelp review, I know, but it just speaks to the quality of workers here.  But one thing I am bummed about -- they got rid of their loyalty cards!!! Boooo!!!

Oh my. I really wanted to like this place more because there aren't many Filipino food choices in Phoenix, but it was just ok.  The saving grace of this place was their special seafood layout (don't really know the official name of it) that we ordered on a Sunday at lunch time. It is only available at lunchtime and it consists of grilled shrimp, fish, rice and 2 sides all laid out on a table size platter of banana leaves. I went with 3 others and it was only $30! It was delicious!  But then comes the bad part--I've had some of their prepared foods in the little trays and they were not very good. I am a huge kare-kare lover and it was not the creamy, savory stew I was used to.   Also, their halo-halo and sago gulaman was.....HORRENDOUS! OMG I did NOT think it was possible to mess up such simple amazing desserts!!! The sago and jellies were so rock-hard and unappealing and the halo halo hardly had any filling. The crazy thing is they have a little section in the restaurant with grocery racks of Filipino foods, including the jars with the standard halo-halo ingredients! Why didn't they seem to use these??  I would not recommend any of their regular food. But if you're looking for a unique Sunday lunch, you should try out their grilled seafood special.

This place was fabulous! My mid-2010 13in MacBook pro died on me on a Sunday night so I brought it in to MacMedia to get it checked. I got there around 1130am on Monday and they had it fixed and ready  for me to pick up by 5pm!   When I got there about 10 min before closing (they close at 6pm), they were very patient with all my questions. The guys there are all so nice! My computer is better than ever!

If you are there during happy hour (3-6pm I think), be sure to ask for the happy hour menu. Otherwise they just give you their regular menu. I guess they don't want people to know about the specials?   I had the Fry Bread ($8) and Shrimp Ceviche ($8) off of the happy hour menu along with a Sangria. Ryan had the Ahnala Burger ($12) with sweet potato fries.  Everything was delicious! The fry bread was topped with cheese, chipotle aioli and some pico--just the right portion. The Shrimp Ceviche was served with two plantain chips that worked really well as dippers. I wish there was more than 2. Not a big deal, I ended up scooping up the rest of the ceviche with my fry bread!  I had a bite of Ryan's burger and fries--no complaints there either! Beef was really juicy and seasoned well.  All in all, a great meal!

Everything here is $2 more than any other pho place in the valley I've been to, but I will gladly pay it because their broth is MAGICAL!!!  The flavor just keeps going and going and going....you take a spoonful of it in your mouth and the flavors just seep sweetly into your tongue. It is amazing. I love it. This was the first pho I tried in the valley, and every other place I go to just cannot live up to it (although I do love how much cheaper the other places are lol).   I have never eaten dine-in here, I have only done pickup during my lunch break. I love calling ahead, picking up a couple things from mekong market and swinging by to get my magical broth.   This place has definitely lived up to it's name.

Wow, this place is popular!   I met a friend here at 11:30am on a Saturday and there was a little group of people waiting. I was told the wait would be 20min, but was seated in 10min, so that was a good start.   I had the Crabby Omelet ($11.99)-- a hefty red pepper and spinach omelet with 2 crab cakes sitting on top, 2 slices of sourdough toast, herb potatoes and the DD hash. The crab cakes were delicious, the omelet was filling, and i loved the sourdough toast.   My friend had the eggs benedict, which looked gorgeous. I'm gonna have to try it next time! I had a VERY long lunch there -- my friend and I ended up sitting there until 3:15pm chatting. Our waitress was wonderful! She told us that she's had patrons come and stay for all 3 meals, each for a different meeting.  The restaurant had a very cozy atmosphere and the menu had a lot of enticing choices. I spend so much time in my neck of the woods (Chandler) so it was nice to get out and find a good place in Scottsdale.

Stopped by on a Saturday night with a bum knee. The staff was very nice! The assistant/tech Chris was super friendly and very accommodating, and Dr. Luu was efficient and courteous. Really appreciate the great service. Thanks! Didn't know I could check in on-line; I waited roughly 30min so not too terrible. Good to know making an appointment is an option, but knock on wood I won't ever need to again ;)

He was more than eager to sign us up, but when we ran into hiccups with their underwriting department, he was less than helpful. I understand we may have had complications with our transfer from Hawaii (gap between insurance policies) and forgotten-reinstatement fee on my husband's license, but he didn't even try to explain anything. Kind of nonchalantly said, "I'm not sure you're just gonna have to check up on it." He also ignored my phone call at the end.    We have since found another agent (Bill Blay with Farmers), who thoroughly investigated our application, worked out the kinks, and even came by our house to get everything settled. We have a policy through Farmers now which wasn't much higher, and we now have peace of mind. We have an agent who answers his direct line every single time by the 2nd ring ... and gives my husband golf advice! :D  I wasn't unhappy with the fact that the underwriting department had a problem with our policy--that's out of the agent's hands and I understand that. It was about how he just ignored us. We were just another policy number--who cares, right?

I go to this One Stop and also the one on Scottsdale Rd. I receive great service at both :) My very, very frequent order of the Strawberry Lemonade low-carb post workout shake is always a  treat whenever I feel like being healthy (but it goes out the window when I have my midnight snack of course) after I work out.  Whenever I have a tournament or a really long day ahead of me, I will stop by beforehand and order a Strawberry-Lemonade low-carb meal replacement shake with an energy boost (Kryptolean) and it provides a wonderful consistent stream of energy without the jitters.   I'm glad I don't live too far from One Stop!

My husband and I came here to do a title transfer on our car, and we got our registration done for the next 2 years while we were at it. There was no wait, and we were in and out in 20min. We paid about $10 extra dollars than if we had went to the DMV ourselves. No line or wait to deal with? Big spacious office? Best $10 spent, ever.   I highly recommend this place! They are very efficient and friendly :)

I've been going to Arizona Combat Sports since February 2015 and I'm very grateful for the experience I've had.   I really enjoy their muy thai, grappling and BJJ classes. I've joined a lot of gyms in the past only to throw money in the wind because I stopped going after a few weeks. But I have finally found a series of workouts I genuinely look forward to with the benefit of gaining a lot of energy for my busy days and getting into better shape.   The coaches are helpful and patient; they provide different levels of drills for everyone in their classes. Pro or otherwise, everyone at the gym is very respectful--no intimidation or judgement here.   Logistically, their pricing is clearly-structured and reasonable, they are right off the 101 or 202 so it's easy to get to and the facility is well-kept.  ACS is a great place for those at any end of the spectrum--whether you're looking for top-notch trainers for your pro aspirations or just looking for a good (and really flippin' fun) workout to add to your day, they do a great job accommodating everyone's needs.

So I have no idea whats with all the negative reviews. I got lucky with this experience because i went against my normal process and purchased the groupon package for 2 colon hydrotherapy sessions before I read the reviews on the place. After I made my appointment, I checked yelp and saw all the bad reviews and I became greatly worried.   I made my first appointment with no problem--someone answered the phone by first call. My therapist, Jeanette,  was fantastic. I had gone to Revivination in Scottsdale before for my first colon hydrotherapy session ever, and my therapist there had been so aggressive with her lectures on vegan eating,  the evils of meat and dairy,  etc that I was very turned off. That's why I was so hasty to try another groupon without checking.   Jeanette told me about the open-system option for Colon hydrotherapy where you sit on a machine and control your own releases into a tub below.  It sounded interesting so I tried it for my second appointment, facilitated by Brittany. Loved it!!! It's kinda grosser but I liked that you didn't need a therapist in the room the whole time so I could play on my phone.  Anyways after that second appointment,  I went ahead and bought a package for 6 appointments for open-system sessions.  They were running a great special for December 2013.   As I'm writing this,  I am on my 4th session at Added Touch lol. Brittany continues to assist me in my appointments.  She is very informative and very accommodating.   I'm sorry so many people had such bad experiences here,  but they are always booked solid and plenty of people are always with me in the waiting room when I go so there are definitely enough happy campers to come back here.   The office is clean, comfy and dimly lit for ambience.  The only thing I would complain about is the chairs in their waiting room, while modern,  are so tiny! Lol and they have colorful pillows on the chairs so then there's no room for your butt!   I'm a fan of this place!

YEEEEEEESSSSS. Finally, some awesome soup dumplings in Phoenix!!! Not some chewy-skinned dried up semblance of one, which I have found at other Chinese restaurants.   The moment we sat down, we ordered some xiaolongbao while we perused the menu. Our main goal was to eat soup dumplings, so we just ordered a beef/vegetable noodle entree as a complementary dish. The noodles were fine, nothing special.   As we awaited our first order of xiaolongbao, we enjoyed watching one of the ladies hand make the dumplings at the counter. It only increased our anticipation. When the dumplings finally came out with vinegar + ginger, I was so happy! You can be certain no other place I tried in Phoenix automatically brought this sauce out--I  would have to ask for vinegar separately!  They tasted great. Is it the best xiaolongbao I've ever had? No, but they were damn good regardless and certainly the best I've had in Phoenix. The broth in the dumpling was very savory, the skin wasn't too thick or dry and the filling was delicious.  Their entrees are reasonably priced too. We'll be back :) Thank you Chou's Kitchen!

Wooooow. I was very impressed with this place. Kinda surprised by the 3-stars. It seems like most of the complaints are about the wait for the food. If you go in expecting it, it's really not a problem. Our server let us know at the beginning that the pizza would take about 45min to come out because it was being made from scratch--sounds fine to me!   I came here with my two sister-in-laws. We had a round of Drunken Monkeys, which were VERY strong and tasty. We started with a regular-sized dinner salad ($5.99) which was just the right size for the three of us. Then an appetizer of garlic bread came out. It didn't seem much longer until our Grandma G's pizza came out. The pizza was HUGE, fresh and delicious! The three of us ate until we were stuffed, and then two of us brought home separate boxes with the leftovers, which were enough for a lunch for the both of us!   At the beginning of the dinner, I had ordered a Hawaiian (canadian bacon and pineapple) Chicago-style deep-dish pizza to-go for my husband. He LOVED it. It lasted him 3 meals--the pizza was so heavy! You could do your weight reps for the day with that pizza...  I am definitely a fan of Oreganos and will definitely be back! Word of advice though, GO EARLY!! We went at 5:15pm, and were seated promptly and the food came out in a reasonable time. The place was very full, and I'm sure the later you go, the longer the wait is.

I work right in the plaza right next to them, so this is going to be a great place for me to get lunch. They also have a mart section. I got a huge jug of Horchata concentrate and a couple bags of fried plantains which made me very happy :)  The owner told me and my coworker that they are the only Colombian restaurant in the state. Great food and very reasonable prices! I had an empanada and arepa and both were delicious. Next time I'm going to have to try their $5.99 lunch special of a 1/4 chicken, rice, salad and drink!

This place was such a nice surprise! I found the restaurant by chance looking through restaurant.com, and I hadn't found an acceptable Japanese restaurant since I moved here.  We had the What the Heck and the Screamin' Roll, ahi tuna sashimi, an unagi roll, house seasoned edamame, and a house salad. Everything was fresh and delicious!  It was interesting to eat a roll with a jalapeno, tomato and onion mix on top. Got a bit of local flair in their sushi menu! It was delicious though.   The family running the restaurant is so nice! We got a chance to talk to the chef, Johnny, who was taking a break outside when we left after the meal. He was so friendly and sweet! He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.   We will definitely be back! There are plenty of other rolls we need to try.

I really can't praise this place enough! It has been 6 months since my first review and our first visit to this restaurant, and all our meals since then have been just as spectacular! We have brought our friends here and they are all 5-star converts as well!   My husband and I have always enjoyed trying new rolls and they have all been interesting and delicious.   The udon here is phenomenal. I usually don't finish my broth at other restaurants, but here I lick the bowl clean. I'll order it even when it's burning hot outside -- that broth is addictive! If only they made ramen as well....lol  The food and the family that owns the place are truly delightful. Love, love, love!!!

Words cannot express how much I love this place. It is definitely my favorite steakhouse I've ever been to, and not even just in Phoenix.  Such reasonable prices, and the tasting spoon, bread basket and pallete cleanser that comes before your entree is phenomenal. The intro alone to your meal is worth 4 stars.  Bread:There is a variety of breads, including one with bacon swirled into the bread, and amazing mini jalapeno-cornbread skillets. It is to die for. The bread also comes with a pesto dipping sauce.   The tasting spoon (don't know what to call it lol): Every night, the chef prepares a one-bite tasting spoon--my favorite was a bite of filet mignon with bleu cheese crumble over some arugula.   Pallete Cleanser: Lemon Sherbert! So refreshing and delightful!  And then the entrees. I have had Lamb and Filet, and they have always been perfectly cooked. Their mushroom sauce is amazing. Everything my husband and his family gets always looks amazing as well--I don't think they can do anything wrong!  We also always get the Sweet Corn Casserole! It's one of the prime sides for $5 and it's large enough that I always have leftovers for another meal the next day. It is so delicious -- crunch, sweet, creamy -- and tastes just as good the next day.  The entrees range between $20-$30 for their steaks, which is on par or cheaper than other steak houses. But what you get for the money is way more worth it. The same entree at Monti's is $40+, and I don't enjoy it nearly as much!   All in all, I cannot tell you how much I love this place. I love it so much I'm always waiting for the next holiday so I can suggest Cholla's as a place to eat :P

This was my first experience at a movie theatre/restaurant, and I was pretty pleased! The food was standard fare, decently priced.  I had the chicken nachos, which was a huge serving, but a bit hard to eat in the dark. Probably gonna just order a sandwich the next time I go so I don't have to look down so much and fiddle with scooping and stuff lol. My husband had the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries, which he enjoyed! We both had vanilla milkshakes, which were kinda pricey--around $5.   We watched The Campaign, which was a light-hearted comedy that didn't require too much attention. At the end of the movie, we came to the consensus that we would never come here to watch a serious movie that required a lot of focus, but for a comedy like The Campaign, it was just fine.  The servers were very nice! They did their best to stay out of the way of the screen--poor things were hunched over and scurrying around the entire time!

I'm glad I found this place -- they aren't the most organized, but once you get in the chair, it only takes about 10minutes to thread your eyebrows, and they did a great job.   I signed in on their clipboard, but a woman who signed up after me ended up going before me because they weren't going down the list. Once an associate was done with someone, they just kinda looked around and ushered over the closest person standing next to them. So I made sure to stand very closely to one of the ladies so I would be next after she was done with her client.  I was expecting to get my eyebrows waxed -- I'd never heard of eyebrow threading -- but I like this new method better! They run a thread over your skin, snipping all your eyebrow hair as it brushes along. Doesn't sound like it would work well, but the results were great. My eyebrows were nicely shaped and it didn't hurt as much as waxing does.

This place is amazing! My brother-in-law lives a 3-minute walk away from this place, and boy, am I glad he does otherwise we would have never found it! I was having some severe poker withdrawal, and finally came here on a Monday night with my husband, his brother and our friend.   They had just finished a Monday night tourney that started at 7pm. We were supposed to make it for that, but got caught up with errands. We arrived around 9:00pm, and played a 10-man 1/2 cash game.   All the players we met that night were very cordial, good sport and fun to play with. The dealers, dapper in their matching purple button-downs, were very professional and polite.   The establishment was very clean and well-maintained. While we were playing, one of the dealers was cleaning and asking if any of us needed drinks. There were a few TV screens tuned into ESPN, a kitchenette, coffeemaker, water dispenser and fridge. They provide pretzels and a few other snacks, free of charge.   I highly recommend this poker room! It's a friendly spot with good people.

This place is a guilty pleasure, found in the most unlikely place--a food court in a mall? Whodathunk. Not gourmet by any means, but its greasy goodness that pleases every time.  The portions are generous and the turnaround is fast. I especially love their singapore rice noodles. Flavors are there, coated in oily wok goodness.   Another surprise is the shrimp they use in their dishes --theyre huge!  Youd expect dinky little shrimp for a fast food place but their shrimp are quite plump and large!  Ive never tried anything else in the food court.  I like this booth too much!

Ryan was craving fried chicken, so we searched for what seemed to be the best place for it. Ezekiel's seemed like our best bet and it was a great choice!   The woman behind the counter was very sweet and friendly. We ordered the 8 piece fried chicken meal with 3 pieces of corn bread and a side of mac n' cheese. The fried chicken was delicious--not too oily or heavily breaded--and the corn bread....to die for!! Wish there was some jalapeno in it, but they probably don't do that to cater to the bigger population.  It's a little far from us, but whenever we have a future craving for friend chicken, we'll know to come to Ezekiels! I need to try their crab cakes...

This is my favorite coffee shop :) Service is always wonderful. Their cold brew provides quite a kick for me to jumpstart my studying!! Their selection of teas are also badass. I like their peppermint green tea a lot. If I'm cramming for a final, I start off with a cold brew and at midpoint switch to the tea and it really keeps me focused for the whole day. I really love that I can zip through the drive-through too if I just want a quick drink while out on errands, especially in this Phoenix summer heat.   I usually come here on Sundays and from time to time they'll have cool local events at their venue. Sometimes they'll have local kids' recitals or live music or little art festivals. I like that they provide a space for these sorts of events. Doesn't affect me too much, I just sit at the bar facing away from everything and put in my headphones so I'm not disturbed at all. There are  outlets in the bar itself so it is very convenient.   One minor thing: I wish they opened til later on Sundays!! They close at 6pm unfortunately :P

If you have little or no experience with ramen, this place will suffice, as the other reviews show. If your only experiences with ramen consists of top ramen or ramen places in Phoenix, then do not hesitate to go here. It's in a good area (albeit kinda hidden in the building they are in), and they seem to have a good selection of sake and alcohol.   ~  BUT....If you are a true ramen enthusiast, do not expect anything close to what your standards are used to.   The way you order is by checking off options on a slip of paper. Broth choices: a sea salt broth, a shoyu (soy) broth and a miso broth. I got the miso broth, and paid for extra toppings: charsiu, togarashi corn, and roasted garlic. The toppings that come standard with their ramen is spinach (really odd...), a sliver of fish cake, a slice of dried nori and scallions.   Charsiu: I was really, really saddened by their charsiu. It was really hard, and they served it cold. If you are used to melt-in-your-mouth, savory and tender charsiu, do not waste an extra $2 to add the charsiu here.  Broth: My miso broth was ok. Lacked any real depth of flavor, but it wasn't terrible. I ordered my husband the shoyu ramen for take out and he really didn't like it. Said it tasted like the powdered seasoning from top ramen, but even saltier.  Noodles: I was satisfied with the noodles here. Not the best, but they are the best I've had so far in Phoenix. They do not make their noodles in house; it is shipped here from LA. That doesn't bother me though. I am used to ramen shops where you can see cute old japanese men making the noodles and shouting greetings to you as you enter their restaurant, but I am sure that won't be a sight I'll see here in Phoenix.   ~  Their grand opening is this Friday, and they will be rolling out their Tonkatsu broth then. That's usually what I would get, or a paitan or tan tan broth (but they don't have that). Maybe in the future I will stop by and try their Tonkatsu broth on a cold winter day...but a good tonkatsu broth needs to stew for a good two days and I remain skeptical.  I will admit, I am a ramen snob. So that's why I must re-iterate that this place will be really good for most people who really haven't had authentic ramen. But alas, my never-ending quest for good ramen in Phoenix continues...

I came aboard at the wrong time--they did my accounting/bookkeeping for a brief stint from Nov 2015-May 2016. They had just moved offices from Gilbert and I was a part of an influx of clients they were sorely unprepared for.    I wouldn't get a response to any emails for weeks even after multiple sends or calls. When I did receive some kind of response, I felt like I was quite the bother. Didn't feel comfortable reaching out to them except for utmost necessary tasks. Details gone over in meetings were forgotten. Going over my files since, there were a few year-end deductions that weren't taken advantage of. It was my first year of business so I didn't know. But I'm not surprised. There wasn't any kind of guidance or communication because they were just trying to get through my files as soon as possible.  Hopefully, they have figured things out since then. It could be a much better experience for anyone looking to use them now. Unfortunately, it was an unnecessarily stressful relationship for my business.

After a shopping expedition at Walmart,  I had an intense craving for pho.  Should have just gone home,  but I had to satisfy my urges.  I'm glad I did because pho vietnam was a great find. I yelp searched for the closest pho.  It was between saigon pho and pho viet nam. I have been to Saigon Pho so I thought I'd try something new.   It was a 6pm on a Tuesday evening and I was the only one in the entire place for my entire meal.  Hopefully they picked up after I left.  My beef pho #16 was delicious!   Broth had good flavor,  plenty of meat and noodles,  and the price was right.  My favorite pho place in the valley is unphogettable in Mekong Plaza, but their prices for everything is $2 higher than here at pho viet nam. So being cheaper is always a plus!!  I will definitely be back!

Yup, just like the other reviewers, I got jipped.   Bought their Living Social voucher, then suddenly received an email saying my voucher had been redeemed--what??  Called MbD, no answer. Emailed Living Social, they said to just call MbD. Duh. Called MbD again, and again, and again. No answer.  Ended up getting a refund from Living Social.

Fabulous place! I don't like going out much on weekend nights because I don't like being asses to elbows with other people, but this place is nice and spacious so it never felt crowded.   We just came here for post-dinner drinks and fun so I can't say anything about the food. Drinks were a little pricey (i.e. a Stella is $7). But they have a a cool $2 brown bag special where you get a random beer in a brown bag. I had wine, but Ryan got one and I think he ended up getting an Amstel Light.  There are 4 ping pong tables and 4 cornhole game setups spread out nicely in the venue. We played both games until closing.  Will definitely be back!

I bought a groupon that was good for 3 visits. We live right around the corner from Aloha Kitchen on Alma School and Guadalupe so we will always be partial to there, but Golden Hawaiian was good.   Most of the entrees are average compared to other Hawaiian places in the valley, but the one thing that really solidified my 4th star for them is their loco moco. Their loco moco is one of the tastiest ones I've ever had (and I'm from Hawaii)! Their burger patty is big, well-seasoned and juicy and the egg/gravy is always well prepared.  I've had the orange chicken, katsu and musubi--all of it was so-so. The only thing I will get from here is the loco moco, but it is well worth the trip for me :)

Oh dear, thanks Karen W. for getting me obsessed with this place! I live very close....too close for my own good.  They have an all-too-convenience reward points program that also reminds you too often of their existence through text reminders. If I didn't like them so much, I would probably be annoyed actually lol. For every $1 you spend, you earn a point. 10pts = free upgrade to large drink and 40pts = free drink.  I'd never had a che before so it's been a very fun new treat to explore! I have so far ordered the Fruit Addict (added red beans), Taro Lover (for the hubby) and Bambu Favorite. Not a fan of the Taro Lover. The very very large portion of taro paste in the drink made it unenjoyable.   I just enjoyed their halo-halo (a limited time special apparently) today and it was delicious and refreshing! Nice twist to the filipino dessert and feels healthier/less sweet. Thank you Karen W. for letting me know about this new addition to the menu!  I will be visiting Bambu far too often for my own good! lol
