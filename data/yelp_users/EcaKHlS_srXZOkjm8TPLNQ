This place is horrible. It was burning hot when I walked in, I don't think the air was on.. and the door is wide open letting heat in.. not smart in AZ. Then the water for my pedicure chair was ice cold.. the chair was broken and looked very dirty. The nail tech I got was very rude and demanded me to move closer or put my foot down more.. even hold my leg while she was going the massage. Really?!! Never again...

This place gets 5 stars for amazing work and customer service. I had my engagement ring sized here and he did such a great job! Only took 3 days for me to get back and I couldn't be happier! Thanks David Jewelers!
