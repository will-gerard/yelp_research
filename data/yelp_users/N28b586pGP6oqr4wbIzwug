Took my 4 year old here for his first sushi, since some reviews said kid-friendly. The staff was great and even brought him some specially rigged chopsticks. I must admit, I was a bit jealous!  For apps, we ordered veggie tempura & edamame. There tempura batter is very light and the veggies were a perfect texture. The edamame was above average.  We ordered a rainbow roll and a philly roll. My son graciously tried both but is not a fan of the stuff just yet.  I however, thought both were delicious!  The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the ambiance there. The flourescent lighting is terrible, I reccommend it for lunch more so than a romantic date. The attentive smiling staff made up for that, though so I will likely be back

great selection of import beers and cheap wine. Thats the main draw for us. Nice staff and in-store wine tastings. Often items are cheaper than the grocery store.

This family owned restaurant is awesome. They serve the olive oil for the bread sizzling, the salads are fresh and great. The pasta is out of this world. So are the meat dishes. If you like veal, theirs is the best!  Note: Be careful when you get a spicy dish!!! The scale goes from 0-4, and I got a 2.5 for my seafood pasta. It was HOT and i eat hot stuff all the time. Best Pink sauce, and they will customize any dish for you. Seafood is very good.  Best Italian I have had in the Northeast Valley, maybe even all of the valley.  Also, please dont come here expecting fast food! The owner is in the kitchen preparing each and every dish himself. Amazing!

I love this restaurant, it is very close to my house and very affordable! The decor is nice. I have eaten here 3 times, and the quality has always been top notch. My only complaint is that the service can be a little slow, so it may not be the best place if you need a quick meal.  Their homemade country fried steak is awesome, either as a breakfast or lunch item.   I will definitely be returning! Thank you :-)

NEVER USE monotronics alarms. not if you ever need to use their customer service anyway.  everytime i speak with them, i cannot understand anything they say. they speak monotone and do not care about their customers. it is a waste of a phone call every time i need to discuss matters with them.

I LOVE this salon. Its a great, centralized location in midtown Phoenix. If you have curly or wavy hair, Charlotte is the stylist to go to, she understands and will give you great cut/color to compliment it. Trust me that is SO HARD to find...And the Aveda products are just heavenly.  The salon is very cozy, yet professional.  There is a great little local coffee shop in the same building too. It is really hard to find a good salon & stylist that you love and feel comfortable with, I am so happy to have Charlotte @ Salon Embellish!

i went to this place expecting very little, we would always drive by and it looked like no one was really there. But this particular Friday night, the lot was full. I had never seen the patio in front but as we walked by, i saw it had great, loungy outdoor patio furniture. Both tables to eat at and couches to chill on. It was already full by 6 pm though.   it had been a long day at a spring training game, so i was reluctant about going out in the first place. But this place exceeded my expectations ten-fold. Its minimally decorated with dark walls and several TVs that all had some sports. There was a nice sized 21+ lounge that we did not see but looked very fun. We were seated and served immediately.They brought out pizza dough for my son to play with, and the service was so spot on and FAST! The food...OH MY this was the best part... so fresh and amazing, and our server Matthew was very knowledgable. He reccomended fresh salami for my caprese salad which was great. We also ordered a small (if small is 16 inches!!!) cheese pizza. It was margherita style and they make the mozzerella for the salad and pizza fresh on location. Very thin, fresh crust, but not too crunchy. The wings were the best part. I am sure this chicken has never been frozen, and not to fatty or oversauced. Speaking of sauce, they have 8 different ones to chose from. I love wings and i am tempted to say these were the best ever.  It was midrange in price, $55 for pizza, wings, salad, beer, wine, a lemonade, & tip. More than i was expecting but i also didnt go into it knowing it was family style. The tables are a little small, and they have no kids menu, but overall I am very excited this place is in my neighborhood. Definitely coming back for date night.
