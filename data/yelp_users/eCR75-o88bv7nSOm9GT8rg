It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.   I'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps.

First guy that helped me had the excuse that he just started 2 weeks ago, 2nd guy had to get an older co-worker to clarify what I could use a store credit fir and what I couldn't and then there was a call out to the owner I assume to re-confirm that I could actually purchase the entry level trumpet on display using a store credit...owner didn't answer so the 2nd guy said 'I guess you cant use the credit' so they failed to make the sale happen due to 'store policy' no one could confirm.  Turns out I would have to pay the higher msrp price to buy something using store credit vs. the  sales price on display...not satisfied and not happy.  I will not be back here.

I walked into this T-Mobile store by my work during my lunch hour yesterday to add a line to my contract and apparently 4 out of the 5 employees there were also heading out to lunch.  I stood in the space where I thought the line would normally be for at least 5-7 minutes while employees went in and out of the back storage area, logged on and off of computer stations at service desk and answered phones and not one said 'welcome to T-mobile we'll be right with you' or offerd to 'help in just a few minutes'...nothing!  I got bored of standing while being ingonerd, so I walked around the store for a bit.  I noticed they have a poorly labeld second desk at the entrance of the store where one of their employees came out of the back room and logged into that station, I gave her a few stares while I was at one of their demo stations to see if she would maybe offer to help and again nothing.  I walked out of there after about 15 minutes of zero acknowledgement or even a sign of service.

The $5 Bacon Burger, Fries & Soda sign on the sidewalk was what brought me in, I just started a new job down the street so I've been sampling the non-franchise hole-in-the wall joints in the area.  I will be back to Two Hippies, the kid behind the counter (Brandon) who to my surprise ended up being the owner of the place was super friendly, helpful with pointing out menu items and came around when I was about half way through my meal to check on me...today I went with their daily special (which changes depending on their butcher/meat selection) which was a prime rib pihilly cheese steak, fries and can soda for $6...this meal anywhere at any of the Camelback/Biltmore spots 3 miles east would have been an easy $12.  He mentioned Fish Taco Friday so I will plan on coming back to try those...also I learned Two Hippies and Long Wong's families are related and that is why he serves famous Long Wong's wings on his menu, another reason to come back.  Support your local non-franchise businesses folks! thx

My First YELP review!  I work by Yogi's and you know how it is trying to find something other then subway or cheese burger for lunch...so I noticed Yogi's opened right next to a failed Moronis hot dog shop by the Harkins theatre by work so I thought I'd try it.  I am a big fan of Teriyaki so I tried their Chicken, beware if you like veggies on your Teriyaki then you order the Veggie Teriyaki which I did not see when placing my order...I been back at least once a week for past month and I have introduced a couple of my co-workers to this joint as well as my wife and kids for dinner once.  simple, clean and friendly - if you smile they smile back...  If you plan on going frequently get their Rewards card, every 5 dollars you get a stamp and at 10 stamps you get 1 item from the menu.  Already redeemed 1 card about to fill my 2nd.  I like good sushi places like Sakana and the now closed Zen32 so I cant compare Yogis with those places but for a quick lunch roll or chicken bowl, you cant go wrong.

Yogurt is tasty as it should be...employees denied wifi access claiming they did not know password and one of the 2 employees kept flirting/playing with a patron the whole time we were at the venue.
