We had a great initial meeting, but things started to turn for the worst at install. The net is incredibly cumbersome, and the installers did not even want to demo the complete remove/put on process at my house because of this. I told the installer that I was really concerned about how long it took and how much work it was... and that I was starting to have doubts. He told me to just leave the net half-off of the pool so that it would be easier to secure. I tried this and with the net half-way in the pool underwater it felt less safe than no net at all. Upon removal I noticed that the roller had a safety sticker recommending that the net was always completely off or on, to avoid entanglement issues. My husband and I gave the net a week... we really wanted it to work out, but found it was so much work that the net did not make it back on the pool after a swim (at least 20 mins in the 100+ heat while my child(ren) waits... no thanks. We called the company exactly 8 days later for a return. They scoffed and said that they have never had a situation where someone wants to return. That there was nothing they could do for me. Now I am stuck with an $1800 net I will not use. So disappointed in the customer service.

We just had a pool fence put in by Arizona Pool Fence. It looks really nice and clean. I was really pleased with the face to face quote and customer service that was provided. We chose the dark brown fence over the sand colored we had in mind, because of Michael's recommendation - so, so glad we did. It is way more transparent, and we can see the pool super well.  Our price matched the quote exactly, and they came right out to get it installed. They arrived on time, and cleaned up quickly.  I also really like that AZ Pool fence takes every measure to ensure safety. Super happy! Highly recommend!

My hungry family of 5 tried this place out because of the location and high ratings. I got a little nervous when we pulled up because the front isn't all that inviting (in a strip mall with a vacant tenant next door). We pressed on.  I'm really glad we did! Our 3 kids shared the chicken noodles (we chose the flat thick noodles, which was a great choice), and my husband and I shared the beef noodles... which was way better than the chicken. Both were good though. We also got the famous dumplings which were really delicious and huge.  Our food came super quick, which is awesome when you have little ones. We got the boba teas for desert and we were full and happy. We still had left overs, even with the two dishes and 1 app. Oh, and the bill was awesome, around $25. Can't beat quality food for that price. We had good quick service too. Totally happy, we'll be back :)

Elite came out today and totally wow'd us today. Our carpet and Travertine was in rough shape (we hadn't had it cleaned since Aug, and we have 3 little ones including 18 month old twins that are hard to keep up with). I left with the kids and came back to a sparkling house. I didn't think it was possible for the floor to look this great. As an added bonus, they even cleaned my highchairs! What a nice treat for a tired mom! Thanks Elite!!!!!!
