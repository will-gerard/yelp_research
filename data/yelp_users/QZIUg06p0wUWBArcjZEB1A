My family decided to come here half an hour before closing. They told us that because it was so late, there wasn't going to be any more food being brought out, which seems reasonable. It was nice that they gave us the option to go inside and look at what foods they had left before deciding if we'd like to pay. My family was starving so ended up staying despite the lackluster food.  There really was nothing great about this place. I've definitely been to a lot nicer and better buffets. I got about two plates and decided I didn't want to put any more salty and greasy foods in my body.  Before people were even finish eating they had already started cleaning. I guess that goods to know... but it was kind of rude considering everyone was still getting food.  The experience was meh.

Came here with family for Sunday morning breakfast and as expected, it was busy. Plenty of parking though. Surprisingly we didn't wait too long until our party of 5 was seated.   Service was a bit slow and not that friendly. Our waitress seemed rushed and never even came back to refill waters.   Food was okay. I've had better from other greasy spoon diners and brunch places in California. I was a little disappointed with the quality and portion. I honestly wasn't full after having my meal, which is not a good sign for a great breakfast.  Maybe I'm picky or all the great brunch places like Bill's and Evergreen Inn have spoiled me, but I expected A LOT more.

Not too much of a recent review as my visit was back in June 2015.  My family and I decided to stop here as our last meal before going back to California. The place was so tucked away that we almost missed it. Parking in the plaza is plentiful.  Inside the restaurant it was very dim and dark. I suppose it's nice if you're in to the whole lounge-modern thing, but to me it just felt like they just didn't want to turn on the lights until it got darker...  My family was a party of at least 12. Service was DEFINITELY slow. Our drinks got refilled maybe once? The staff here spent their time talking to each other at the front desk and in the back then properly serving their customers.  Food was decent. My aunt ordered for everyone so I can't tell you the exact items we got, but everything was mediocre and nothing was that flavorful. Fried rice, stir fry noodles, bulgogi, pork belly... I think the best thing we tried was the sashimi and cucumber salad which I wish was a bigger portion.

Hands down the best buffet I've been to yet!   My cousins and I discussed many options before settling on this one. Although it can be pretty darn pricey, I honestly think it's worth it considering the extensive array of options you have for food, dessert, and drinks! So many amazing options; it's a little overwhelming! My favorite had to be their chicken salad and pasta dish.   They had so many different kinds of dessert, including various flavors of gelato. I came back so many times the staff remembered me (kind of embarrassing, but he was really funny and made light hearted jokes about it).  The staff here were unbelievable! I never expect much from the staff at a buffet, but our waitress and waiter were so great; they were refilling drinks every 10 minutes and clearing plates at the same time. They were all super sweet and nice and made great conversation with us.   Food here was so delicious, my family and I ate until we couldn't move.  The only downside was that there was so special show going on and we couldn't park on the premise. We had to park across the street and be go-carted to the entrance... which was pretty cool.

A great place to go if you're looking for something to do for a weekend.  My family and I came here for some fun bonding time. We all chose to do something different. Some of us made candles. Others made soap. And others decorated a cake!  Making candles: Such a fun process! Pick a shape, chop up some colored wax, choose a scent, watch your candle get made! I made a beautiful rainbow peach scented candle. It smelled wonderful, even a year after it was made.  Making soap: Got to choose cool letters and glitters go add to it. We got to watch how they make the soap and put it together. It was way cool, and we were all adults. I'm sure the kids to nuts for this!  Cake decorating: Difficult according to my cousins. You need a lot of skill and patience. Lots of fun fondant to play with! And then you get to take the cake home and eat it after 50 or so pictures to post on social media.   Staff members here are such a delight! They were so fun and had a great sense of humor. Amazing customer service! They had a cute little Instagram frame in which you could snap a photo of yourself with.  Finding parking was a nightmare though.

I wish there was a Dutch Bros in San Jose, CA...   My cousins and I were running some errands when I noticed we drove by a Dutch Bros! I told them if we stopped there, I'd treat them out.  We got two customized teas and a coffee. The wait was long in the middle of the day. It was raining oddly enough in the middle of July. Cool dude was standing outside taking orders just like how they do it at In N Out. He was funny and charming.  Our drinks came out perfectly at the drive thru. Can't wait to be back for some of that refreshing tea and strong delicious coffee.

Good, not great.   Sorry Arizona, but your milk teas don't even come close to the unique variety of teas we offer in California.   My cousins were craving milk tea after dinner and this was pretty much the only place to go...  The place was very colorful. Music was blasting while we were waiting in line, which kept us occupied. Various different drinks were ordered that I can no longer list all of them. Overall they were decent, but nothing special or memorable. No "wow" factor about the place or any of the drinks.   Staff was friendly. Plenty of seating. They also had a few board games to play if you ask.

What a great little lunch spot!  Make your own pizza and salad places usually disappoint me due to their rushed nature and poor quality, but that was not the case here.  Staff members were so patient and friendly, recommending which items paired well with the ones my family and I have already chosen. We went with both salad and pizza. The ingredients were so fresh.  Everything came out in a timely manner and was absolutely delicious! We all did family style so that everyone got to try a bit of everything.   Seating can be a little limited, but what do you expect from such a great place located in a shopping center.
