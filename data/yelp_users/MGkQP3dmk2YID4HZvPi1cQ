Seriously the slowest service I've ever experienced. Been sitting in the drive thru for 30 minutes and not moved. I would pull out and leave but I'm blocked in. This is insane.   If I wanted to wait for over 30 minutes for food, I would have gone next door to Cornish Pasty. At least I would be able to grab a beer while I waited....

It's a dive bar but it's a GOOD dive bar! $.50 pool and $6 pitchers of Bud Light. This turned out to be a great little venue for guys night out! Rock and roll playing on the jukebox and friendly staff.

Sent my wife home crying. This location is a complete joke. Ordered the wrong tires multiple times, lied, and didn't communicate for 4 hours as my family waited.   Only ONE person was willing to help and that is the reason for the single star. Without him, I would give this zero stars. With so many mechanic shops and auto repair places around, you can afford to treat your customers so poorly.   When mentioning their yelp rating, I was told, "no one cares about that."  Well, new manager of Fletcher's, for your sake, I hope you're right. I would be willing to bet that more people take stock in customer reviews than you think though. Especially when it comes to shady service and poor treatment.

The service here was extremely sub par. We had a Groupon and ordered food for pick up. I was put on hold for 5 minutes before they took our order.   We were told the food would be ready in 30-35 minutes. We went to pick it up right on time, but when we arrived it would be just "5 more minutes" we waited another 40 minutes before someone else came back out to ask us what we were waiting on.   Finally, after an hour and 15 minutes of ordering our food, they gave it to us without an apology or anything. We got home and the order was totally wrong. They had given us someone else's food. We called and they said we could come back in 30-35 minutes if we wanted to fix the order. Too little too late. It was 8pm and my pregnant wife was starving.   Avoid this place if you can....even with a great Groupon, it isn't worth it.

Honestly, was not impressed. Employee taking order was short and rude. Overpriced for what I ordered. Better than subway but not nearly meeting the level of what I expected. It's supposed to be a local icon and favorite. I dunno...was not feeling it at all.

This place hand changed hands many times over the years but remains open! It had been YEARS since I had been here and I was pleasantly surprised at the remodel and with the now owners.   The food was good (had a breakfast sandwich and my kids had a bagel with cream cheese).   The only complaint that I have is that they do not display their prices on the menu board and I didn't get a receipt when I paid so I don't know how much everything was.    Because this place holds a special place in my heart (my wife and my first date, 10 years ago) we will be back!

To be totally honest, I wasn't really impressed with Joe's. That's a sad thing to say because it's pretty much a Gilbert staple. The pecan smoke flavor was okay, but I thought the sauce was very very runny and not to my taste.   The other major issue that I had was the way that the soda fountain was set up. During busy times you weren't able to get refills without pushing past what seems like 100 people.   I've given it a few different tries, but I think I'll stick with what I know to be my taste in BBQ here in the valley.

Super impressed with this location. Had another auto shop tell me I needed brakes and other stuff done. I got a groupon for here and went to have the work done. They were honest and told me I didn't actually need most of the stuff I asked for. Hands down the most honest place I have found in the industry.

Service was prompt and the food and good! Really enjoyed that they had a happy hour but was a little surprised when the happy hour portions were just a couple bites. The server didn't explain that and when I ordered mushrooms for the table, it ended up being a couple bites for one person. If we needed enough for the table, we might as well have ordered a full priced item.   Other than that, this is a good little place to grab some fresh, semi-healthy foods. My kids love the hummus trio and my wife and I always seem to order the chipotle chicken lavash pizza!

We swing through the drive thru occasionally Sunday mornings. It is almost a guarantee that they will mess up the order in some way. This morning we had to ask FOUR times for the correct donuts and I still had to go back inside after they put the wrong ones in the box.   We also have noticed that their coffee (which Dunkin is known for) has gone totally downhill. I would rather drink gas station coffee over the stuff they are selling at this location. I'll gladly drive out of my way to avoid the service and quality of this location.

Hard to find someone is this field you can trust. Had some issues with wisdom teeth and Dr. DeFelice was a total rockstar!! Helped calm my fears about the procedure and everything went well! Follow up was awesome. Like having family help you out.   I would totally recommend this practice to ANYONE looking for a good dental practice!

Horrible horrible horrible customer service. Overpriced food. I really can't say enough bad things about this location.  We go here because of convenience of location to our house. After multiple visits here, I would rather drive all the way to Glendale for a bagel before I go back to this location.   Management doesn't care about ANYTHING and our food always comes out wrong. When asked to make it right, we are treated like we are a burden to the staff. I really don't know how this place stays in business. We have made multiple complaints to corporate about it as well.

SO happy we found this little hole in the wall right near our house. The prices can't be beat and the food is amazing!! Management was SO polite and helpful to my family. Every time we have come in we feel like we are treated like family!   The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my favorites. We used to go to The Coffee Shop for burritos but we just found food that is 10x better for 1/2 the price!   This is definitely a spot we have added to our regular digs.

Customer service is a huge thing for us. They close at 10 PM but we went in at 9:45 and was told sorry everything is already closed down we can't make anything. Why in the world would you close your restaurant 15 minutes before your actual closing time and tell paying customers that you can't do anything for them.

Sweet delicious burrito heaven! This location is closest to us so we usually frequent it when the cravings hit. Can't go wrong when you are getting Chipotle.

I wanted to give a five star review but I can't make myself do it due to the speed of service. We did the drive thru and it took almost 15 minutes to get two meals and two shakes out to the car.   The 4 stars was definitely for the food and ice cream. My wife found this place and recommended we try them out. The burgers tasted fresh and the grilled onions were delicious. The big kicker was the shakes. These things will change your world. If you love Bilzzards, you will never go back to that other place. Order a small because it took me three sittings to finish all of mine!   We will definitely be back!

Probably some of the best prices on coffee I have come across in the Valley. They have toddy concentrate that you can take home to make your own.   Staff is friendly and it's a super cute atmosphere. They have a back patio that is perfect for relaxing and enjoying your food and drinks during the parts of the year that it doesn't feel like we are living in the fourth ring of Hell.

One of the best and least expensive gyms around. I pay $10 a month and it has everything I need. Good machines, plenty of cardio equipment, a squat rack, a pool, and lots of free weights.   I have looked at several gyms in my area and this one was hands-down the best in price and options!

This is a PERFECT place for the little ones during summer! When it feels like your children will burst into flames if they step outside, finding a place to take them and allow mom and dad time to relax can be difficult.   We have been coming here for a few months and both of my children LOVE it here! The price you pay is for come and go, so you can come early, leave for nap time, and come back.   They have a jungle gym, bouncy house, and tons of games and toys for the kids.   They even bring in superheroes and Disney princesses to entertain the kids and do story times.   Make sure you bring socks for you and the kids.   My only complaint is that I am surrounded by moms. Where are the dads??

Super helpful! Their prices are lower than any I was able to come across in the east valley. Prices were great, but the service and what they offer was even better. Got what I needed quickly, and without a hassle. I would use them for sure another time!

I have used Lyft many, many times and it has ALWAYS been a great experience! My drivers have been prompt, polite, and fun. Last ride I took, my driver had cold water and candy also.   On the nights where we go out and have a good time, it's nice knowing that I have an option other than a cab to get us home safely.

Tucked into the northwest corner of Williams Field and Power, this is a great find! I came here after hearing about it on KUPD and will definitely be back! They had a great selection of juices and the staff was incredible when it came to answering questions and making me feel comfortable.   Prices were great. Glad I found this spot close to home!

I am going to start this review by saying the some of the staff we have dealt with have been friendly and TRY to at least make things right. However, the quality of the food really kills this place.   My wife and boys really love donuts and we tried to make this our Sunday morning spot. However, after consistently getting food that is either cold, undercooked, over cooked, stale, rubbery, with hair on it, or weird shades of gray, we can't do it anymore.   We tried and tried Dunkin! You let us down. I don't want a refund. I want you to fix the system in your store that is broken.   In all honesty, if you need a donut, go across the street to Bosa Donuts. Support a local business and actually enjoy your food. Sorry Dunkin...get your life together and maybe we will come back.

Ok so I have to preface that this review is not for the food. We didn't actually have a chance to EAT the food because everything else was so terrible.  We arrived at 8:30am on a Sunday to grab a breakfast with the kids. We quoted 30 minutes wait for a table. Not a problem at all! Took the kids across the street to grab some coffee from Bergies and to wait. After 40 minutes, go back to check on our time. Still a wait....30 minutes after that we finally are sat at a table.   After a little bit our server comes over (she was very nice but could tell she was hot and stressed out). We place our food and drink order right away together. We wait 40 minutes and food still isn't there. Server is no where to be found. Water is empty. It's now been almost 2 hours since we first arrived and still no food or anything.   We ended up getting up from our table and just leaving. I tried to find our server to let her know but again...nowhere to be found.   I would highly suggest hiring enough staff to handle the demand you clearly have!   I don't know if we will ever attempt to eat here again but if we do, I'll update my review.

First of all, I have to say how amazing the follow up from management was following my previous review. They were professional and prompt in getting us taken care of and addressing each of our concerns. We went back today for breakfast and the food was outstanding. Service was prompt and friendly. We will absolutely be coming back! Well done Snooze!!       Previous Review: Ok so I have to preface that this review is not for the food.
