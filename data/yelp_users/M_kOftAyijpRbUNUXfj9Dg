Will more than likely not come to the salon... The girl at the front counter greeted me as I walked through the door and said "please let us know if you need anything, you have the entire store to yourself" . So I said "even the salon? " and she kindly said yes. There were 3 people at the salon looking like they needed something to do. I asked if I could get a haircut and they said yes but the girl then proceeded to head to the back to talk to an older gentleman and after about five minutes came back and said he had already clocked out and they were waiting on some appointments. Hhmmm?!?!? All of a sudden they had appointments? #rude

This place is legit. The overall theme looks franchised but the food tastes authentic.
