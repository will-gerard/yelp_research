YUMMY, YUMMY.....Awesome cupcakes.    Randy did a great job assisting us for our friends birthday treat.    Thanks for the recommendations on flavors.    Everyone enjoyed and our server at lunch was pleased to have such a great treat with the few that were left.

Arby's isn't what it used to be, I went thinking of the roast beef of my youth.   It was average at best.

Easton  ashe  playing today, it's amazing outside today.  You need to find your spot and try the wines.   We spent time at the Spotted Donkey and enjoyed a few cold beverages and yummy food.     El Pedregal is really trying to get traffic thru the plaza by bring great entertainment each and every Sunday in the Spring and Fall.    The crowds are pleasant and always a nice breeze thru the plaza to enjoy the concert.      I recommend trying a few events and visiting the merchants in the plaza.

I love this Pei Wei, Tim the manager makes it a fun place to be.   The Thai dynamite is always good.   I love the black tea.   Mix it up and order the brown fried rice.....

Thank heavens this Subway is still in Biz.    The staff is a rotation of kids, but the sandwich and bread never fail.    Thanks subway for your $5 promo.

I love this place, who eats a hot dog in fry bread.   You will if you go to Indian Village.   Great tacos, fry bread and burritos.   Stop at the Circle K next door and get a sixy of your favorites to enjoy with the best mexican food in Cave Creek.

I'm not sure why such a good review, this store is always cluttered and seems dark.   Check the dates as we have purchased items that were out of date on multiple occasions.     Too much competition in the area to spend time in an average store.

I tried to give them another chance.   They baited me in with the 30% off wine sale.   I thought ok, sure.....why not.    I went last night and purchased 6 bottles to receive the additional 10% off.   Today I went back to find another wine I wanted and met with the  wine department manager.    She was snotty and walked away from me while I was trying to understand why they don't carry the specific wine.      Thanks but I don't need the drama.   The sale was nice but I'm out!

I love to sit at the Bar with Gary and Thea.   The buffalo meatloaf is amazing.   Don't fill up on too many chips as they are extremely addictive.   This is a great date place.   ENJOY!

Not sure about all the hubbub.   The samples were nice but the food didn't do anything special for me.   The cookies at the end were delightful.     I'm not sure that Chinese and Mexican belong together.   My husband liked the relleno but wasn't wild about it.      The people were all incredibly nice hence 2 stars.

We visit this restaurant often.    Visitors from out of town love the atmosphere, especially the ducks.    We were looking for breakfast and wanted to go somewhere different.    We had not tried the brunch and thought it was about time.    The brunch was a good value at $14.95 with a large selection of regular menu favorites and a few added bonuses.    The omelet bar, waffles and fresh fruit were a nice added bonus.    It's a great place to take the kids and grandma.    Enjoy a nice margarita or mimosa with your brunch.

Nice birthday dinner celebration.   Awesome place to take starving college kids.   They loved the food and the to go bags to feed them for a few days.   Everyone there was very friendly, making sure that the birthday was special.

This is a bit out of the way but I was pleasantly surprised.   They got us in very quick and did a nice job on the pedi.   Even the hub was pleased as she brought out the power sander (just kidding) to our dry dry feet.   The prices are competitive and the massage chairs were some of the best around.     The creative design on my toes was no challenge and turned out awesome.

Not sure what the other review has to do with this subway.   This one is a great improvement to the store that was in this shopping mall previously.   The kids that run it do a good job of moving the customers.   With $5 sandwiches it's always busy.   The bread and ingredients seem fresh each time we have had lunch....

I so love this Costco, everyone is great!   I'm working on the under $200 plan but the wine selection is so good that I rarely make it.      Your team is great and always helpful!

Zipps, always fun and good food.    Had the Saturday burger special for $6.50.     Quite tasty and good company.   Great lunch for under $20.    Can't beat it.    Free rides to events and all the tv's to watch any game.    Great for the kids and the lovers of Golden Tee too.   Zipparitas are hard to beat.

I live in the neighborhood and had been avoiding the place.   The reviews from others  were mixed.   We went on a Sunday mid day and it was packed.   We saw our old friend Donna and had a beer.   She brought us her favorites, Sloppy Joe, Roast Beef and Fries.    Those fries are AMAZING.   The sauces really bring out the flave.      I would have the Roast Beef again, the Joe a bit sweet.   I'm much more spicy.   We finished with the apple tart, quite tasty I must say but a bit on the small side.      Worth the drive and the atmosphere.....

Yummy is all I can say.   My husband had never really experienced great tamales.   He had the usual dried out bland tamale, not at The TAMALE STORE.   It was the Saturday before Christmas and they were basically sold out.   We bought the 3 options they had, Red (hot) pork, Green Pork and the green corn.   WOW, the green corn are now going to be a favorite.   We used our rice cooker to steam them and made rice at the same time.   AMAZING.     We can't wait to go back and get more flavors.    Thank you so much!!!

Vampiro, wow it rocks.   Happy hour $2 beers.  I love this place.   Pork w/mangos, carne asada, chicken it's too hard to decide.   It's a drive but so worth it!

Walmart, what are you thinking?   You match everyone's price, it's a blast at the checkouts with all the ads from other stores.   This store is clean and quick to get in and out of.    All the cashiers are smiling and ready to help.

Oh so yummy.   The breakfast actually turned to lunch.   3 outstanding tacos Pulled Chicken & Pork and Brisket.   I didn't get my car washed as rain was in the forecast.    My spouse had the 2 meat plate and didn't share.   He was highly impressed, service was stellar and refills on drinks never stopped.     The menu has a nice variety for every appetite.   Do try the corn, it was a nice treat and they even cut it in half for sharing.    Don't stop there, make sure to finish it off with a nice tasty desert.    The cupcake was just the right bite to finish a very nice morning.

I've never been much of a quitter but I'm thinking I may need a longer stint in Rehab.   This place is great.   These people made one of my other fav's so why not start anew.    We started with the Pig Wings (the sauce will be my new favorite on everything), YUM.   We proceeded to have the burgers (Hatch Chili Burgers and Mush/Swiss).  The hub ordered a 1/2 Shelby Spinach Shalad (he wasn't sharing).   We enjoyed the Fries (I did not see a Mermaid) and Tots (oh so good).   I recommend the sauces in this order  Peach Habanero, Spicy Ketchup, Chipotle Aioli, Stellar Mustard, Teriyaki Pineapple Aioli.    Like we really needed more so we had the Key lime pie.     The team at Rehab are great!   Everyone is helpful and engaging.     Whatever your addiction, they have the Therapy!   See you soon.

I wish it were closer.   I love sampling from each truck.   You gotta love when you can have a smoothie and burrito at the same table.

Wow, I wish I lived closer.  Rebecca met us at dark thirty in the morning with a big smile.   The specials are priced right.     We asked her what she recommended, her first was waffles or pancakes.   Check, pancakes ordered.   Next the choriso (they make it in house), yummy.   The price is right and a great value.   Weekday specials are $1 better than weekends but you won't be disappointed either way.    This is a must visit.   Don't let the limited # of reviews factor in your decision.

This is a long drive for me, but very well worth it.   The tacos are YUMMY and the margi's tasty.    Local Arcadia people that have been in the neighborhood forever.   Take the time, it's worth it.    Great flavor and choices.   Make it yours!

Thanks SkyHarbor for putting a great quick place like this in the airport.   It was packed as usual and La Grande Orange has the same great english muffins and homemade jams as the location on 40th and Campbell.      Nice friendly staff and a great selection.    It was the busiest place in the airport and worth the limited wait.

Gigi's is my go to place, no longer... 2 X's I've stopped in (4pm) and they barely have anything in the counter and no chocolate.   I appreciate busy but it looks like it is time for a new cupcake store.
