Au Petit Four was a fabulous lunch find! Located in the Esplanade, its tucked into a nice spot behind Houston's. Simple Decor, nice patio and plenty of tables. Lunch was so tasty! I ordered the lunch combo, 1/2 a cold sandwich and soup. The soup was a minestrone and it was so fresh! The noodles were nice and firm and there were tons of vegetables and beans. For the sandwich I ordered the Prosciutto & Brie and it was awesome! For 2 lunch combos, 2 beverages and 2 pastries the total came to $31, not bad for a fabulous french lunch! I will definitely be back :)

This is a "go to" spot for us. Always. I have never, ever had one complaint about an experience or the food and I have had the pleasure of coming here for 5+ years regularly (weekly?). Great for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. Great for clients, friends or dates. Fabulous ambiance inside (always have fabulous music) or on the patio (Central location is my fave). Love the simple modern decor peppered with mid-century touches.  I've used them for catering and it's been a delight and clients LOVE Postino! Nothing on the menu is the wrong choice, absolutely nothing. Incredible ingredients, impeccably chosen. Favorite Bruschetta choices (you choose 4) are: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. Yum! Best starters: Pub Board, NYC Grilled Cheese (I die for that mustard), and The Butcher's Block. Favorite salad is the Mixed Greens, better than it sounds! I've been known to come in and just have wine and order the bowl of olives for dinner, they are that good. This is one of my happy places, if you haven't been, you must!

Great place to pop into for healthy lunch, I recommend takeout unless you want to watch Telenovas during your lunch, I don't.  The interior hurts my eyes, bright blue and red furniture was a little too much for me. I love Greek food, and they serve a solid chicken kabob, chicken was great and marinade was sooo flavorful! Lots of fresh vegetables served with the side salad, the rice was unusual, but good, not your typical jasmine rice which I prefer. All and all good experience.

Too bad there is not an option for NO stars...Meeting clients for lunch, my associate and I were seated in the back, on the left in one of the middle booths. First red flag should have been that the back of the booth upholstered back and seat cushion had at least a 1" gap, exposing the wood frame its built on. We both sit down on one side, facing the back door. Waitress and trainee were very nice and got us water. After sitting for about 5 minutes, something catches my eye, I look down and in my lap is a COCKROACH!!!! I kid you not! I hit it out of my lap onto floor, and managed not to scream which is a miracle. I immediately got up and told my associate and waitress, quietly. Had to stay because we were meeting clients, moved to front table to white knuckle it through this meeting! I will never, ever go back.

Here's the deal- As far as food goes, this place deserves 5 stars, its inventive, fresh, Mexican food and always amazing. The location is great and I would love to frequent it. However, the owner Azucena Tovar always comes off as a little ambivalent about her clientel, and I just can't get over it. We eat out a lot. My expectation and hope is an evening with great company, food, and service. Great company I can handle, great food Los Sombreros has covered...but the service makes me wince. The owner is the first person to greet you at the door and she is abrasive and has been rude (kinda sets the tone, it's her place after all). Not once, not twice, but several times. I try and support businesses that value and appreciate their clients, especially in this financial climate. So my compromise is take-out. We only (rarely) order take-out and on the condition my husband picks it up so I dont have to be reminded why we no longer eat there. Christmas tamales are to die for.

My favorite local sushi spot for years! Don't be misled by the outside of the building. Back in the day this was an El Pollo Asado, complete with a drive through window, intially when I first visited Dozo, this almost prevented me from venturing inside. So glad I took a  chance! Sushi is always fresh, I have never had a bad experience, and at times I visit Dozo several times a week.  You can dine at the sushi bar or at booths. The decor inside is simple and comtemporary. Service is great, but may not be the best option for you if you are in a hurry. Say hello to owners Rissa & Robert they are so friendly and if you are a regular they will remember your name and order...who doesn't love a place where everybody knows your name? Ha!

I've never had a bad experience here ever! The hummus is incredible, the hummus trio is my absolute favorite! They are always extremely accommodating when I ask for a side of cucumbers instead of pita bread which is great! My best recommendation is to always try the daily specials, they are always the best! Their lemonade is to die for. Very fresh and inventive! Super friendly staff, always go the extra mile and ask if I would like a to-go iced tea for the road...yes please! Healthiest kids meals ever! My kids love eating here, and we've patronized many locations. Only drawback to this location is parking...if you come during the lunch rush, good luck to you! Come early, like 11 am. or late after 1:30 so you can get a spot & a table :)

Fabulous mid century treasures...for all price points. They are absolutely a delight to work with and complete professionals. I am so glad they have moved into this space and are no longer just by appointment only! All of their pieces are in such great condition and they tend to have really unusual cool items. Love this place- huge fan!

Not being a "bike" person, the thought of venturing into a bicycle specialty shop is a little intimidating to me...however, they couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, which totally put me at ease.   They have a very informed crew working there, everyone was busy working on bikes or talking with clients, but they didn't hesitate to take the time to answer questions and educate me a bit about the products I was looking to purchase. My son purchased a "Fixie" and not only is it slick, its a piece of art really (and this coming from someone who doesn't really dig bikes!), but the price was more than fair. Not sure whats going on with some of the haters reviews on here, my experience was delightful and I would definitely recommend Bicycle Haus to novices who are looking to buy a fabulous product but need a little guidance.

Upscale, throw back vibe to when dining was an experience. The interior is spectacular, our favorite place to sit is in the bar, the glowing blue light really sets the mood for a relaxing ambiance, and we love the musicians that play. The happy hour is impressive, and the prices are unbelievable! The staff is fabulous, from the hostess, server, busboys, to the management, everyone is friendly and attentive...you really get the impression that everyone is invested in your dining experience. We have dined here many times, and they consistently exceed our expectations. For appetizers we have tried the calamari, goat cheese ravioli (my fave), and the fondue which I love. My favorire thing about our dining experience here is the fresh day boat seafood! Its such a treat to have fresh Halibut, the day after its caught in the ocean, in the middle of the desert! Steaks are phenomenal...Im not sure how they cook them, but something about it is different and special. I recommend Oscar style with asparagus, lump crab meat and bernaise, decadent but worth it! My favorite desert is the creme brulee, warm crunchy sugar crust on top with a cold creamy inside. Sides are delightful and ample enough for sharing, favorites are the jalapeno au gratin potatos, asparagus with hollandaise, and glazed carrots.

When I want a completely over indulged, guilty-pleasure, (what diet?) meal I come here. I love Lolo's. The staff is warm and friendly. There's usually a wait (Scottsdale location), but it moves fast and is so worth it. If you're counting calories don't come here...you will starve, there's nothing for you on the menu :) But if you want comfort food, soul food...read on. I always start with a nice tall jar (love) of old school red kool-aid! I die, it reminds me of being a kid, so good and pure sugar. Everything I have tried has been wonderful: fried okra, grits with butter (yum), fried chicken, waffles, greens, mac&cheese, and to conclude a fabulous meal red-velvet cake. Take-out is great and done well.

Consistency is critical, and difficult when there are so many factors needed to have a good experience dining out...but Culinary Dropout has never been a disappointment- food, service, decor, and ambiance! Love the antipasti create your own menu, its my favorite! Other items I have tried that have been amazing: House Potato Chips, Soft Pretzels, Onion soup, Roasted Chicken salad, Grilled Cheese Sliders. The deserts are so flipping good, the best being the Salted Caramel Custard. Not sure what happened to the Chocolate Cake, its the best in town and I miss it.

Great Old Town Scottsdale hang out. Located on Goldwater & Main. Upscale decor, think 1950-60 mad men-esqu, very masculine. The drinks are stiff, you get what you pay for because they are not cheap. The food is fabulous! Incredibly fresh and delicious upscale bar fare. My favorites so far are the Tuna carpaccio which is served with avocados, potato's and blood oranges- great combination of flavors and textures. The filet bites with creamed horseradish are served bite size and are tender and juicy. Best scallops I've ever had-ever, ever- I have no idea what is on them but I crave them now! Butter lettuce and golden beet salad is a score as well. The service is great, it just keeps getting better and better. This place is hoppin', chef Aaron May has done a fabulous job with the menu, this is a bar that I go to for the food, over and over again.

Let me just say I have always been a fan of the original Vigs interior. The uptown location is no exception...absolutely fabulous! Each time I visit, I discover a new feature I love about the interior here, right now its the sculptural wall behind the bar. But honestly I have never been impressed by the food, once, and I always want to be...until Tuesday night. First off, had a fantastic waiter, Stuart (a transplant from AZ88) loved him, great service, couldn't have been better. Right there, just for fab decor and an equally fab waiter is 3 stars with me, but tonight the food killed it! Had the Pad Thai and it was incredible! I could not believe how good it was, super flavorful! Finally!

2 stars based soley on customer service. I actually loved this place, great finds, at really affordable prices, I'm a fan of their merchandise (can be a little rough), location, and prices (merchandise sometimes needs a little work, and prices reflect that). I would tell everyone and anyone I know that is looking for mid century furnishings...even a few that aren't. Not any longer. I believe one of the owners names is Jeremy, really nice guy and very pleasant to deal with. Ryan, the other owner, not so much. Such a shame, I will have to refrain from shopping there any longer due to my last visit and my unpleasant experience... **I will add that Ryan was cool enough to message me and apologize for my bad experience...pretty rad and appreciated**

Fresh & Easy is a delightful addition to the neighborhood. Love the prices, love the produce, and love the pre-made items. Not a huge fan of the meats here, but I'm weird about meat anyway, so that's all on me. I love that I can seamlessly shop and be secure knowing that the ingredients are worthy or serving to my precious little fam. What was life like before we knew about Fresh & Easy's peanut butter pretzels...hello? I love that items such as brussel sprouts, radishes, the pain in the rear to clean produce, is all neatly packaged and cleaned! I hear this location is the busiest in the state & one of the smallest. Great staff- We just love it!

Without doubt THE best frozen yogurt in town!  Yes they do swirl your sample for you, which took a little getting used to...However, at a recent visit to the competition I noticed patrons eating from the sample cup, and then refilling...yuck it's the equivalent of double dipping! So I now view it in a different light and I'm happy for the assistance with my (and everyone else's) sample!  I tend to be fairly calorie conscious, but I'm a sucker for pastries and baked goods of any kind...and they have mastered the art of capturing birthday cake, or an oatmeal cookie. Yum! Ample topping offerings if your into that and a fabulous streamlined decor. They have a TV. inside which is typically running Nickelodeon which the kids love.

Love the new digs! This is a MUST for dining in old town!  Met a friend for a light lunch, and it was a delightful experience from beginning to end!  We chose to sit on the patio, and glad we did because that wont be an option much longer heading into summer. Beautiful patio, lots of low slung chairs with comfy pillows, and plenty of umbrellas for shade.  We had the chilled cilantro-lime crab dip and wow, just wow! It is paired with plantain chips, and per the recommendation of our server, we went half plantain chips, half sweet potato chips, we enjoyed every last bite! It was excellent. We also had a special of the day, flat bread with brussel sprouts, pancetta, and cheese, extremely flavorful. I would order the same lunch again over and over I enjoyed it that much.

Kitchen 56! How have I managed to miss this little gem? Loved it! Started with the chips and onion dip, a classic, paper thin, fresh chips and creamy onion dip, what's not to love? Our party ordered the pulled pork sandwich, burger deluxe, and the arugula and fennel salad, all excellent and prepared to perfection. HAD to order the brussel sprout hash, as I love brussel sprouts, and figured it would either be very bad or very good...delightfully, it was the latter! Fresh and savory, a perfect side. For desert we order several to sample, creme brûlée with fig reduction, deep fried banana split (was that homemade ice cream?) and made to order zeppoles with sugar and cinnamon. Phenomenal. Start to finish it was a great night. David was our server and he was fabulous, I'm a stickler for good service, it can make or break a restaurant for me, and he was impressive. I will absolutely be back, can't believe it has taken me so long to make it in!

Wanted to love it...and I did!   First and foremost, love the decor, love the vibe. Mid century vintage lighting, paired with an entire wall treatment made out of old cassette tapes...whats not to love? Killer music.  We started with two ice cold no.89's and they hit the spot, very smooth, mild pear taste, perfect cocktail for a summer night. We also chose to sit inside.  Our first item was the double dip, very good! I hate eggs, but I liked the Cobb dip anyway, it was that good. The posole salsa was delicious and my fave of the two, paired with the kettle chips it hit the spot.  For our entrees we selected the mixed grain salad (excellent vegetarian option) and it was light, but substantial enough to be a meal. The orange basil dressing is fabulous without being too sweet. I also order a side of the house smoked salmon which was incredible, best I've had, my only complaint would be the portion size, very small, but maybe my opinion is skewed because I enjoyed it so much I wanted more... We also ordered the Porkwich which was very generously portioned! Holy smokes it was large, wasn't sure how it could be maneuvered to get a bite, but we managed and thoroughly enjoyed it! Here's a tip: once you have picked up the Porkwich, don't put it down! You wont be able to arrange it properly again :) Also opted for a side of mac & cheese, it was good, and a nice departure from typical "side" offerings. Great staff from host to server! The only element missing from this picture are fabulous deserts...coming soon I hope?  All and all great new spot, next time, and there will be a next time soon, we're sitting on the patio it looks fab :)

This is by far one of my favorite lunch time spots. The feminine decor really lends itself  as the perfect destination for a lunch with your girlfriends, but the food is substantial enough to impress any guy. Started with the Crab and Avacado tower appetizer, it was divine. I had the Pesto shrimp salad and my guest had the goat cheese and mushroom tart. Both were prepared perfectly. Loved the fact that they left a nice sized decantur of iced tea on the table for self service. It was less intrusive and ensured my glass was always full. Great experience.

After a delightful experience at Windsor, we decided to walk the 20 steps next door and check out Churn.  Glad we did, it was fantastic! Two scoops of Coffee ice cream in a waffle cone was the perfect conclusion to a great meal! Great coffee flavor and the ice cream was the perfect consistency, yum! We also ordered an ice cream cookie, snickerdoodle cookie with coffee ice cream, which was equally splendid.   Its Windsor and Churn for the one-two-punch of dining :)

Had an absolutely spectacular experience from start to finish, what a fabulous score for Old Town dining!  We went for happy hour and it is by far the best happy hour in town! They offer a nice selection of wines by the glass for $5 each. We decided to try an ample selection of appetizers to share to get a good feel for the menu. We had the Kobe sliders, the salmon bruschetta, the pulled pork sliders, the fig jam & ricotta sliders, the Cesar salad, and the artichoke orzo. The portion sizes were perfect and I can't say enough good things about the presentation! And the taste...unbelievably good, like too good to be true good! We finished with a delightfully light tiramisu. Quality all the way around, by far exceeded our expectations, we will definitely be back. The service was on par with our meal and flawless as well. The server was attentive and witty, and the manager (owner?) took time to introduce himself and inquire about our experience. If you haven't been, you MUST try it!

We are fans, regulars, and mildly obsessed with this place...We have tried almost everything on the menu, with fabulous additions and specials from time to time. The food is impeccable. High quality, fresh, and inventive and the prices are good. The location is great, the atmosphere is casual, staff is friendly and attentive. Late night dining is the best in town with a slightly abridged menu. Drinks are hand crafted, great beer and wines. From dining in to take out, we have never been dissapointed! AMAZING!

Authentic, quality Italian. Loved it! Restaurant is quaint, owner is very friendly and warm, chef is also very friendly and inviting.  What we've had:  Caesar salad, homemade dressing which is hard to find and very good! Lasagna, outstanding, pasta is light, sauce like my grandma from Italy made. Gnocchi, feather light with an exquisite Alfredo sauce. Chicken piccata, chicken is so moist and pounded thin, finished to perfection with a fresh lemon caper sauce, and served with wonderful oven roasted rosemary potatoes. Chicken Parmesan, also pounded thin, best I've had.  We've had take-out and then sat on the patio tonight with my husband and daughter. Love this place!  They don't have a liquor license yet, so it's byob, and you can pay a small corkage fee.  Go here, seriously.
