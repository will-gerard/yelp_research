if you like terrible service and overpriced food you've come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I would've stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasn't awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a "Rock" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n' cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe.

Got a burger here and opted for the onion rings instead of french fries.  Once the food arrived, after a considerable wait and empty water glasses, I instantly regretted my decision.  The onion rings were those skinny little fried, non-onion, onion rings that seem to be showing up everywhere lately.  While they are all fine and good on a burger, as a side they are a major disappointment.  The burger was pretty much a McBurger with a bigger bun.  I could have handled the average food if the service wasn't so lackluster.  Go for the golf, don't stay for the food.

If you go for the pizza you're doing it wrong.  It's not very good.  1 or 2 star pizza at a five star place.  But sub par pizza is still pizza so it ain't all bad.  We got our food really quick and stayed for about an hour an half to watch some kind of mad genius play something that looked liked the cab on an old steam powered locomotive!  He controlled a little mechanical bird that chirped notes to certain songs from that thing!  The future has truly arrived!  Do you hear me?  The future!!!!!

Since Sweet Tomatoes decided to become some pay to play bull... decided to go here for a salad bar.  What a relief to find a place not trying to charge you to breathe on the food.  All you can eat for the price of a combo meal at Jack in the Box.  They have all the fixins you need to make a decent salad, and that's all you really came for anyway.  The soup tastes canned, which isn't a bad thing, and the bread is what it is.  The service was great and I will be going back.

Probably go to this location, or the one at Arrowhead, once a month.  Very much a fan and rarely disappointed with each visit.  They usually have coupons online and they take them from your smartphone!  The only gripe I have is that their bananas at breakfast are usually still a little too green to be tasty.  Although the donut muffins make up for it!  Recommended for all meals, but lunch and dinner are usually a little better.  Screw Flanders.

After you get your drink the waitress turns into Houdini.  Poof, gone, no more service for you.  Needless to say I didn't eat here, you can only sit and wait for someone to take your order for so long before you just get up and walk out.  Just a tip, don't eat here... ever!

House Special Chicken!  Eat here at least once a month and always get the same thing.  House Special Chicken dinner combo.  I suggest you do the same.  I'm sure their other stuff is good too but why try anything else when you've had the best?  Good egg rolls!

It had been a long time since I had eaten at a Garcia's and I was kind of looking forward to it.  Last one I actually ate at is now a Popo's.  I think I'll go to Popo's.  If the rudest hostess in all of Phoenix doesn't put you off the lack of air conditioning certainly will.  I'll be happy to see all the Garcia's close again.  And to the rude hostess, I hope you lose your job.

The egg roll wasn't too bad but the house special chicken just seemed a little off and dry.  Also the fried rice had quite a few of those hard crunchy grains of rice and burnt eggs.  The service was incredibly fast for take-out so I would definitely go again, just maybe order something with beef or pork.  The prices are pretty hard to beat, $16 for two dinner combos!

Sweet and Sour pork and Beef with Broccoli is outstanding.  The Garlic chicken is good too.  Had to up the stars because two was really unfair after one dish.  Service is super fast and you won't find a much better price!  I'll keep ordering for a long, long time!

A bar within walking distance (albeit a bit of a long walk) is a very happy time!  Their beer selection is pretty ho' hum and the big screen projection screen TV has seen better days, but the clientele and pitcher prices are second to none.   When it comes to entertainment during your intoxicated adventure they got you covered.  Pool, darts, jukebox (The internet kind, nice!), FREE shuffleboard (Unless you really need a machine keeping track of your points.), and golden tee/buck hunter style arcade games are all at your disposal.   I've spent many a long night at Dave's and will continue to do so, not just because of the proximity, the prices or the games, but the atmosphere and interesting individuals you're inevitably going to run into.

Went to 2 games in the last two days, sat in two different spots, both lower level, both wins and both excellent!  Having been to quite a few games in past seasons I knew what to expect, but it seems that every year they improve upon the experience.  This season, for the All-Star game, they added a canopy on the west side of the stadium for those either hanging out at Sliders or just waiting to get into the ballpark early to take in some BP.  It's a subtle feature, and yes, it was necessitated for those out-of-towners waiting for god knows how long to get into the mid-summer classic, but a great addition nonetheless (Haven't seen the north gate area, so if they added one there as well, kudos!). They've also added a new craft beer to the standalone beer carts, an unfiltered Arizona brewed ale called "Fretzy's."  At $10.50 a pop for 24oz. it ain't cheap, but it's fairly tasty.  Other than that the food seems pretty similar to what it had been in previous seasons.  I may have seen a new yogurt place in there but I'm usually not about the food...  Good team, a new decent beer and a place to hide yourself from the unrelenting AZ sun, talk about a hole in one (Golf reference!)!

I miss the "Metro Midway."  If you enjoy shopping for shoes and baseball caps look no further, other than that there is nothing left.  They have added a movie theater that smells like cat food, so I guess that's a plus...

You order and they fill out something that looks like a tax form, hand you a metal rod with a number on it, take the tax form to another person behind the counter that makes your sandwich, they hand you the sandwich and you hand them the metal rod and go to the register.  Anyone else seeing too many steps in this transaction?  I'm pretty sure they are running some kind of practical joke show and airing it on some channel I'm unaware of.  How else do you explain that insanity?  Does Paradise Bakery own stock in carbon paper or something?

Woohoo! As good as gets!  Probably would give four and half stars but since I liked it a little more than that I'm glad yelp sticks to whole stars and not fractions of them.  Great pizza, with broccoli my favorite vegetable, is what you'll find on this menu!  And at 10 bucks for a small, which could easily feed two people your wallet certainly won't be giving you grief.  Oh, and the vodka penne pasta was so rich is was like a dessert but in pasta form, fantastic-ness-ism-astic!

Eaten here many times, just figured I should write a review after eating at another bakery that claims to be "Paradise" that shall not be named.  Wink Wink.  They have this crazy concept of ordering your food at a register, paying the cashier, then waiting for your food to be prepared.  Mind Blown!  The only thing that bums me out is that sometimes they have the Cuban sandwich and other times they don't.  If it's on the menu it's the only thing I will order, if it's not it isn't the end of the world.  They have a wide variety of interesting sandwiches and standard soups that are done very well.  Plus they always have The Arizona Republic available to read!

Ate here today after work!  The exclamation point was unnecessary because I eat here a lot after work on Fridays.  Also eat here a lot on Saturday mornings.  That explains my weight gain.  The green sauce.  Get the green sauce/salsa.  Everything is good that I've ever had but the green sauce/salsa takes it to the next level!  Eff that red B.S!  Go green!  Usually get a taco and burrito.  Good prices, great green sauce/salsa!  Is it salsa or is it sauce?  You be the judge!

Martin Mull is trying to seduce Terri Garr and she ain't having it!  Oops, must turn off TV to write about delicious $.99 fish tacos at the great, wonderful, fantastic LJS!  If you don't like fish or are put off by the smell, have no fear, batter and oil are here.  And if you've had a hush puppie you know what heaven tastes like.  Well maybe not heaven, but 65,000 ft or so...  Good fries also.

I am not an interior decorator so I'm going skip the shortcomings of the restaurants design, feng shui, I need a place to have Ikea furniture for me to enjoy a meal there, and talk about the omelette.  Mel's Omelette is delicious.  It must have an entire block of cheese in it, plus you get hash browns (Those are covered in cheese), and it's filled with breakfast meats.  The amount of cheese is just unreal.  I love cheese!  So in turn I love Mel's Omelette.  Oh yeah, and you get toast.

I'm going to go back.  If only to try a different soda.  Fantastic!  It honestly would be a 4.5 kind of place but I'm rounding up because of how quick the service was and the insane variety of sodas you can choose from.  it's basically the Total Wine of soda places.  I got some Leninade soda and it was delicious!  The wife got a grape soda that made you forget about any other grape soda you've ever had.  The food is great too.  I had the Santa Fe burger and it had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting (it had to be the pickles!) , and a very nice bun that absorbed everything the burger was throwing at it, and it was a lot (Good house sauce!).  Again, I will go back, and I will get root beer!

Went here for dinner on recommendations from a friend and a giftcard from my sister.  We didn't have to deal with the parking nightmare so many people are complaining about because we have legs and can park a block away.  Didn't have to wait for a table, although if we would have shown up about ten minutes later...  The place filled up quick!  And I can see why.  We had the firecracker shrimp appetizer which we thought was very good, we ate all of it including the lettuce that was underneath, just to get some more of the spicy wing style sauce.  We shared a spring roll, I forget which one, it had imitation crab, some noodles, lettuce and something else?  My girlfriend really liked it, it was just a little too much (not meat and cheese) for my liking, I will say it tasted very fresh, just not my thing.  For the entree she had the beef pho soup and really enjoyed the hell out of it.  I had the (I think it was called) Shaking Beef?  Little cut pieces of beef on a hot iron with onions and some really good garlic sauce and white rice, very much approved and much more my style!  The waitstaff was very friendly and quick with water, always a plus!

This might be the first Chinese buffet that had fried rice available that wasn't bright yellow and full of huge chunks of onion.  Also they have a spicy chicken that most other buffets seem to have gotten away from.  The real star of the buffet though (besides the neon sign above the entrance to the bathroom that reads "resteroom") is the Hibachi grill.  Nice fresh vegetables and a good assortment of meats, good teriyaki and garlic sauce, and a nice talkative guy behind the glass making it all for you!  Hooray!

Are the hash browns supposed to be almost raw in the middle and taste kind of fishy?  Everything else was okay but those hash browns needed some serious help.  I think this movie on tv right now called "Big Miracle" is better.

This used to be a Bamboo Grille and then it was something else I think?  Now it's a really good Chinese food restaurant.  I get the Sun Devil Chicken (At least I think that's what it's called?) and the wife gets this fried coconut glazed shrimp stuff, they are both out of control!  Abacus Inn also has a Sun Devil Chicken but I don't think it's quite as good.  Very happy this place moved in near home.

By far the best Gamestop to get recently released used games.  Whenever they run their buy 2 get one sale this is where you wanna be.  The staff is also very nice and the store is clean and organized.  Very much my favorite of all the Gamestops.  Now back to Gran Turismo 6!

This place is fantastic!  Try to pop in once a week to get something new and I'm never disappointed.  Not only do they carry a bunch of stuff you don't see anywhere else they have some extremely competitive prices!  Easily the same or lower than anywhere else I've seen in the Valley.  If the prices and selection weren't enough the owner knows his beer and is always ready to give a suggestion on a certain beer you may be looking at as he's tried most of them.  If you like craft beer and you want to try something you may not find anywhere else check this place out!
