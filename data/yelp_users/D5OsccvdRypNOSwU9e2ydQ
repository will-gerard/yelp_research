This market is pretty incredible... not only do they carry a large variety of asian food and kitchen products, but they also have a variety of products from other countries (such as India, Nicaragua, West African, etc.)  Their produce is typically pretty fresh and cheap and they have an extensive variety of meats and fish.  My only complaint is that they do not carry a great deal of seafood.  They have some clams and some tired looking baby octopus, but no mussels, fresh calamari, etc.    I noticed that they also have a great selection of imported beers (some I had never even seen before).  My bf's kind of a beer conoisseur so I'm always scoping out new products to surprise him with.    Lee Lee's is a great one-stop shop for ALL your ethnic food needs.  Feel like Thai cuisine tonight? got it.  Mexican? got it.  Cambodian? got it.  Some crazy looking fish? definitely got it.

Beautiful presentation, delicately simple flavors, and a superb chef.  We ordered one each of the seasonal omakase (which you have to reserve in advance since the ingredients are hand selected by Chef Nubuo and prepared by him only on the nights he is in house) and the regular omakase with wine pairing.    First of all, I thought I was going to be out by the end of the meal after drinking so much wine and I'm not a huge fan of wine, but the pairings really were spectacular.  There's also a list of a few thousand wines available if you are so daring to read through the whole thing.  I was pleasantly full after the meal which included such dishes as seared octopus over tomato and fresh mozzarella, oyster uni shooter (my personal fav), mushroom melange, lamb chop, etc. etc. etc. Also, the last dish of the regular omakase... the foie gras was so melty, smooth, and rich that I almost cried... I literally had to hold back the tears from pure culinary ecstasy...    The dessert assortment at the end was a nice finish-- banana creme brulee, assortment of ice creams, green tea custard.  Chef Nubuo is not only creative, but incredibly kind and attentive to his customers.  Not the typical stuck-up sushi chef....  The hostess was a bit snotty since we were sharing omakase meals, but we ordered a bunch of a la carte items and drinks as well.  The total for four of us still came out to be over $400... so why she was giving us the glare from time to time I have no idea.  If the chef is fine with it, the hostess should care less.    So aside from the annoying hostess, all was well in Sea Saw land.  It was a truly fantastic experience and one I would recommend you to try, but be willing to open your wallet for the pleasure.

Glad I'm not the only one who could care less about coming back to Myst.  Very typical club, with pretty hideous music on a Friday night (the hip hop in the smaller room was ok once he started playing some fun classics that I could actually dance to).  Whatever noise was playing in the main room was ridiculous... everyone there was probably just so out of it that they didn't notice that the dj was just spinning s*** on vinyl.    No intentions of returning, but it was fun dancing for a bit to some oldie hip hop.

Sushi Ken is completely unassuming.  From the looks of the outside, with its neon beer signs, etc. I thought what kind of place are they taking me to... but after seeing the extensive menu and tasting the yummy cold soba (with its slippery goodness) and surprisingly fresh for the desert sushi, I was hooked.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix, this is one of my top choices for lunch.  They have some great special lunch deals as well. I haven't had dinner here, but it seems like more of a lunch destination to me in terms of atmosphere.

El Rancho is not just a market...it's almost like a food village.  As soon as you walk in, you're confronted with the hussle and bussle of people moving about, ordering food from one of the many stalls, and eating nicely priced burritos, meats, and desserts.  I've been here twice and it's just a fun place to visit, like Christy T. said.  There's just so much energy in here and some great aunthentic food that is quick to go!  There's a yummy juice stand inside that sells a variety of aguas frescas and they even have homemade ice-creams, which unfortunately I couldn't try because they were cleaning up for the day and everything was already put away...   This is also one of the cleanest Mexican supermarkets I have ever seen....it's like the AJ's of Hispanic markets... with neatly placed products on every shelf.  I'll upload pictures soon so you can get a peek.  El Rancho is definitely more than your ordinary supermarket.... it's an EXPERIENCE!

Came here on the way out of Phoenix and had an amazing special iced coffee called a Toddy.  They cold brew it for 24 hours which retains all of the flavors and caffeine, but because there is no heat involved, you don't get any of the bitterness that you would find with an espresso.  It's super caffeinated though--I drove back to LA high and wired!  I got the spiced version, which has subtle flavors of clove, cinnamon, and cardammon(?)  The owner was so nice and even explained to me how a Toddy is made.  They even have supplies in the store if you want to try and make your own at home.  Everything in the store is FAIR TRADE and ORGANIC.  You can also purchase loose leaf teas and coffee beans by the pound.  I got 2oz (about 10-12 servings) of Blueberry Rooibos tea for $5!  What a steal!  Definitely check this place out--I read a sign on the door that said they are trying to change ownership, so hopefully this place will not go by the wayside.  There's yummy breakfast wraps for $4 and the bagel with homemade sundried tomato and basil cream cheese ($3) was also a great way to start my morning.    Support Bunna Coffee and organic/fair trade goods--'nuf said!

We decided to stop in for some dessert and tea after spotting the delicious assortment in the window.  As we walked in, we were told that they were actually closed, but since the server hadn't turned off the open sign, she could still serve us desserts (which was perfect because that's what we came for).  Even though it was closing time, the server was really friendly and let me smell a variety of the rooibos teas before deciding which one I wanted to order... those teas smelled so yummy it was hard to decide!  We ended up ordering the Faux Coco rooibos (which has a hint of spice, fruit, cocoa flavor) to it and the Ginger Peach which smelled fragrantly of jasmine flowers.  We also tried four desserts: the three-layered chocolate mousse, strawberry mousse shortcake, chocolate hazelnut ganache cake, and the cheesecake.  Each one of these not only looked good, but tasted delicious.    The tea was served in the most interesting container that actually pours the liquid from the bottom of the pot as you place it on the rim of your glass.  Ingenious....    This place is on the pricey side ($6 per dessert) but the treat was well worth it.

I just got back from eating lunch at Stacy's.  They offer a pretty extensive variety of items on their menu and we ordered a nice sample of the goods--fried tilapia, fried catfish, rib tips, fried okra/pickles, yams, fries, greens, potato salad, rice and gravy, and sweet potato pie!  I was so excited to find out this place had rib tips because I love sinking my teeth into that yummy cartilage, but the cartilage was slightly overcooked and the meat was kind of chewy.  The fish had an overly fishy flavor to it and the greens were a bit on the salty side.  Suprisingly, the sauces they served with the items came in packets!  We would have thought that the hot sauce and tartar sauce might have been house-made, but it was just the cheap kind from the packet.  The yams were incredibly sweet as was the pie.  The best items were the potato salad and french fries, but I don't go to a BBQ joint just to eat the sides.  Overall, I probably wouldn't go back here since there are always other BBQ places I could try.  Nothing really was wow.... so another one bites the dust.  :(

Double Yum!  Pho Ao Sen is a pretty place to get Pho and other Vietnamese dishes.  A big group of us went so we could try a collection of items.  It was pretty chill when we went since it was after the typical lunch feeding time, but I heard this place is pretty popular so it's probably a lot busier on weekends and evenings.    Here's a smattering of the things listed according to my favorites:  1.  Marinated Fried Chicken Wings-  These were phenomenal... marinated in a sweet and tangy sauce and then fried.  When you bite in, the juice from the marinate seeps out.  Just try it and you'll know what I mean.  2.  Grilled Pork Spring Rolls-  I typically don't order spring rolls in restaurants since I like to make them myself at home, but these came with a really interesting mango type sauce that I have never had paired with traditional Vietnamese spring rolls.  That was what made them so unique and delicious!  3.  Vietnamese Beef Curry-  Not a huge portion, but just enough to satisfy a hungry girl.  The beef was tender and seasoned nicely with a hint of star anise.  4.  Pho Dac Biet Bo Vien-  Actually I ordered pho with just rare beef, tendon, and tripe (you can kind of pick and choose the meats you want if there are certain meats you don't like).  The meats were fresh, the pho broth was clean and tasty, but lacking some of the spice flavors that I'm used to... couldn't tell you which ones.  And for drinks:  Try the Che Thai (coconut milk over ice with mixed fruits--jackfuit, palm seed, jello strips, and coconut jelly)  or the Che 3 Man which is coconut milk with mung bean, red bean, and some other mystery bean.  A little on the sweet side for me, but still yummy!  Pho Ao Sen has a great atmosphere... fresh, bright, and stylish, but still serves comfortable Vietnamese food in an unpretentious way.  Great presentation of dishes and overall nice experience.

BoCa7 is an exotic Vietnamese restaurant that offers the traditional specialty of 7 courses of beef and fish.  As soon as you enter the space, you are enveloped in a sea of red... from the red orbs of light from above to the red mosaic tiling on the walls.  This place has a very bright and friendly feel while still maintaining a sense of the exotic.  The food is also fabulous--they offer a variety of dishes other than the 7 courses of beef and fish option.  Being a fan of red meat, I tried the cubed beef tenderloin with garlic and onions--this is served with a watercress salad and rice.  The slightly sweet and peppery marinated meat simply melts in your mouth.    We also ordered one of the house specialties, the crispy skin oven roasted whole Catfish sprinkled with crushed peanuts, scallions, and carmelized onions. This dish is phenomenal and unlike any fish that I have had.  What I really enjoyed was the crispiness of the skin.  The Catfish meat was also very soft and delicate.  The dish is served with rice paper, mints, mixed greens, green banana and apple slices, and bean sprouts which you use to wrap the fish in.    They also serve a variety of traditional desserts and specialty drinks, such as freshly squeezed coconut juice with lime.  It opened its doors just about two weeks ago and if the food is this good now, it can only get better.  It was late Saturday night when I dined here, and there were still a number of patrons in the restaurant.  If you want to try some non-typical Vietnamese food in a friendly, chill environment, this is a great pick.

I ate at Bo Ca 7 again on my weekend trip to Phoenix.  It was as yummy as it was the first time.  We decided to dine outdoors since there was a loud graduation party happening inside with some not so happening music.  We ordered the freshly pressed sugarcane and kumquat juice which kept us cool and the thinly sliced beef that you cook yourself in heated vinegar and then wrap with lettuce, mints, and rice paper.  Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was lively, yet relaxed (since we sat outside).  Too bad it's so HOT in Arizona!

Grabbed a few things from here to go and everything was pretty tasty!  The Vegetarian Spring Rolls were yummy with fried carmelized onion threads instead of shredded pork... the dipping sauce tangy and sweet.  We also got some tiny sea snails cooked in a coconut sauce with a hint of yellow curry.  Basically they're so small you have to suck them out and along with that come the tasty juices!  We also got some larger sea snails which were steamed and served with a simple fish sauce.  I actually preferred dipping these big boys in the coconut sauce from the mini-snails.  All in a all a good take-out experience and the crawfish Austin C. mentioned sounds tempting since there are not really any good places to go for this in Phoenix.

I agree with the other Yelpers in that Truckin Good Food is awesome!!  They bring such an authentic style crepe to the PHX area--something hard to find.... for a reasonable price too!!  I also had the sweet crepe with banana, vanilla pastry cream, and crushed meringue (I have never had anything with crushed meringue before and it was yummy!)  We also got the kimchee vegetarian crepe with cheese and shredded coconut  (what a crazy combo--I think I'll get another one today since I'll be volunteering at Tet today again--yay!)  Erin and Jeffrey are so sweet too--something very hard to come by these days :)

My bf's dentist is in AZ and now my hairstylist is too!  I'm really low maintenance, but I do need to get a trim every few months... so after a little frustration with how my previous stylist has been cutting my hair, I figured I'd give someone else a try.  Trevor is very affordable at $50 for trim and style.  And his chunky, assymetrical style preference fits with my style likes.  He is trained in the Toni & Guy fashion, where edgy meets modern.  It's been a few weeks since I got the cut and it's growing out great with no need to blowdry or style....  I'm keeping it at 4 stars for now, but if my next visit meets the standard, then 5 stars Trevor will get :)
