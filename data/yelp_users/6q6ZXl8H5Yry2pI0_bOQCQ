Tuesday nights can't go wrong. But don't try to find a parking spot. Great place for a date!

What can I say...Love this place. The food is definitely the best mediterranean I've had in the valley. Chicken Shawarma and lamb shank are where it's at. The hummus is thick and delicious too. Go in not expecting much but awesome food at a very reasonable price.

Went to Totties being Noodles Ranch is closed Sundays. The tom kha gai was really good at a spice number 7. She laughed on the phone hearing a white boy order something so spicy. The ambiance inside is really interesting as well. I'm definitely looking forward to trying their pho there next time!

Kelly was fantastic. I was pressed for time and he took the initiative to make it work. Thanks!

Great patio and nice beer selection. The pizzas are small but delicious. I could probably eat 2 by myself if I was really hungry.

Great atmosphere and good food. This is my go to pho spot. Not as good as the place with the un-rememberable name on Apache and McClintock, but great for Scottsdale. I'd ask for extra noodles with the pho bowls though. Thanks for the cleanliness and the topped off Sriracha bottles!

After seeing this place start to chain out everywhere I decided to give them a shot. Seems like a good idea but I left after waiting in line for too long. There was only one couple eating and 2 people ahead of me but nothing moved. I guess I wasn't in a patient mood but I had to leave frustrated. I'll give them another shot sometime. Two people working on a busy Friday night while ASU is in session won't cut it.

Very nice place with an awesome beer selection and tasty foods. The AZ burger was as good as the server said it would be. Hard to find parking for dinner because it was so packed but valet was complimentary at least. Not much of a night scene but great for an early evening.

Great place to get some awesome beers. I always have fun picking out the flight combination of the night. I realized that I'm a "save the best for last" kinda guy! The food is really good too. But I wouldn't bank on getting in for dinner during peak times...I probably wouldn't even want to with how busy it gets.

This place is the jam. I was pleasantly surprised from the moment I pulled into the parking lot. The Steak taco with the tempura style poblano was one of the best tacos I've ever had. The guac was legit too. I think this is one of the few guac servings that we weren't able to finish being it was such a heaping pile of goodness. And the frozen margaritas are the way to go, tastes just like the famous Z-tejas margs.

Great place with healthy options. I am a fan of the hot breakfast cereal with greek yogurt and fruit. Definitely another great addition to an already superb lineup in Arcadia.

This place is always a good time. It's definitely the classier option along the "strip." I like all the coconut water mixers available too.

Another great patio spot to hang out at in old town. Seems like a fun day drinking spot too!

Decided to give this place another chance after a terrible experience last time I visited the previous location. The new building had a funky odor going on inside so we opted for patio seating. As soon as we sat ourselves at one of the 7 open tables we were approached my a manager saying that we had to wait to be seated by the hostess. Upon mentioning all the vacant tables he told us that they were in the process of "tracking down" those people to seat them. So we stood up and lingered until we were given permission to sit back down at the same table.  The table side guac was great but the server never returned to take our order for entrees. We finally flagged down the manager who apologized and began taking our order until the server ran over to relieve him of her duty. He then told her how embarrassed he was for having to do that...awkward. We then continued to wait for our food for 30 minutes before I finally called the manager over again and told him they obviously forgot our order somewhere and we wanted to leave. For the negative experience he comped us a round of cheap girly shots (Washington apples or something) and presented the rest of the $25 bill.
