I have formally been banned for life from ever attempting to do my own electrical work. Seriously. The Dodge Electric electrician told me this.   The guy who came out was inappropriately hilarious and I will definitely use him again...as I will inevitably need him again. Not only did Mike's (I'm PRETTY sure his name is Mike) visit fix the electrical issue I created myself, he made me laugh and saved me HUGE. I was playfully mocked for working at home in my pajamas and for making a stupid DIY mistake. He also understood immediately that I attempted to upgrade my outlets and switches in my house built in 1968 to save some cash, so he assessed the issue, fixed it, and actually TAUGHT me how to do it correctly so he wouldn't have to charge me for more than the initial 1st hour flat rate. YES!   I hope I don't get him in trouble for outing him about the inappropriate humor...but I can admit that I started it (something I never would have admitted in every fight I instigated with my brother as a child) and that it was incredibly endearing and has won my business for LIFE!   Thanks guys and good luck on your novel, Mike! I love having electricity in my living room again! I'm sure I'll see ya soon.

uhhh...this place is terrible. Like...TERRIBLE. Goodwill next door ranks about 400% better than this place. I have no idea how this place has anything higher than a star??

These guys are amaaaaazing! I've been taking my dogs here for years. Not only is the staff extremely friendly, they have the best groomers I've found, and I've tried out many across the valley. What's even better is that they're the best around and their prices are extremely reasonable.   So back to the staff being amazing - at least 2 employees remembered my dog's names after just their first visit. We probably pop in about every 2 months and yet they STILL remember their names and their quirks every time. Chris is awesome by the way!   I have absolutely NO complaints. Try this place out, you'll LOVE it.

A fantastic idea!!   I'd describe How Do You Roll? as the Subway of Sushi - but good!   You are able to select each and every attribute of your sushi roll and they make it right in front of you as you like. Yesterday I created my own version of a traditional Spicy Tuna roll and it was phenomenal! I had a Seaweed Salad on the side and was stuffed on just these two.   Since this was my first time I was impressed that the staff was so patient with me, especially with the epic line forming behind me. This is definitely a lunch hotspot! If you're a sushi fan, I'd say this place is DEFINITELY worth a try!

Insanely, ridiculously amazing! I am kind of mad I found this place...because I'm obsessed! I'll admit that I have yet to try the tacos but that's only because the Standard Burger is just way too good not to order every single time. Don't skimp and not order a shake. Once you have one you'll see what I mean! Yum!!!!
