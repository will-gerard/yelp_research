When we called to ask about reservations and wait times, the hostess refused to tell us how long the wait would be. Asked to speak to a manager, who proceeded to do the exact same thing. I guess they don't need our business, so we won't be going. Ever.

If your goal was to hire the biggest douchebags on the planet as bartenders, you certainly succeeded. We would have stayed and ordered more food and drinks as the night went on, but your bartender was such a colossal jerk, with so much attitude, that the 12 of us left and took our business elsewhere. You can count on us never coming back. Ever. Extremely rude, especially for an anniversary party.

Beware! We called to ask if it was possible to get a reservation and were told that it was. We asked for 7pm and they confirmed. On arrival at 7pm, we were told that we would have to wait an extra 40 minutes, and that they don't give reservations. We left immediately. I'm not eating somewhere that would make misleading statements to get us to come in.

The two stars are for the good service. NO stars for the food and drinks. Sub-par, to say the least. The sauce tasted canned, the bread was flavorless, the pasta was overdone, the pesto was just weird, and the cocktail tasted like a grocery store mix. Unsatisfying on every level, and an insult to the people who chose to eat there. I imagine it only survives by getting the overflow from the far superior restaurant next door.

I would have rated them 5 stars for the furniture and some of the prices, but they lose 3 stars for the bad salesperson I dealt with. I walked into the store, cash in hand, ready to buy a fairly expensive chair. The person said they would price match most retailers, so I showed him a deal I'd found online, the same chair for $150 cheaper. I don't expect a brick-and-mortar store to exactly match an online price, so I was willing to meet somewhere in the middle. However, the salesman had no interest in even trying. He just looked at the price online and said, "Yeah you should just buy it from them, then." No attempt to make a sale, just completely dismissed me even though I was ready to make a deal. Salespeople like this are the reason Internet retailers are destroying local stores. If Mod Home ever goes under, they should know it's because their people are costing them money.

Best burgers in the valley, best frozen margarita in the valley, with a fun and relaxed vibe. This is one of my new favorite spots.

Excellent food, very fresh. Good service, nice atmosphere. The wait can be killer, but if you have the time, it's worth it.

Mediocre food, indifferent service. The beef carpaccio was underdressed, the short rib was closer to pot roast and woefully under seasoned, and the olive oil cake paired overly tart flavor combinations and unstrained raspberry sauce. The food wasn't terrible, it was just unsatisfying. No desire to go back. Decent happy hour prices, but they were out of all the unique beers on the menu.

Killer atmosphere and service, great cocktails, and the food was absolutely delicious. It's more upscale than I expected, but in a good way. I realized I was underdressed as soon as I walked in, but no one seemed to mind. Definitely make reservations if you want to go during any kind of peek time. I will absolutely go back and bring friends with me.

Stellar service and delicious food. One of the owners was frequently on the floor and checking in with us, and the wait staff was attentive and accommodating. The beer selection is a bit too skewed toward IPAs, but there's still a good selection and it's great to see all AZ beers. The pizza and desserts are very obviously made from high quality ingredients, and the flavors were bright and strong. I will most definitely come back, and I'll bring friends.

Mediocre food, lackluster atmosphere. Not a good sign when the lobster roll is flavorless. There are restaurants within walking distance from Crab & Mermaid that do the same food, only much better.

A refreshing take on the Chipotle fast-casual style. Nice flavors, good quality seafood, and fast service. I've been several times and always enjoyed the experience. My one criticism is that the employees can't seem to handle any kind of special request. If it's not exactly their routine for how they build the dishes, I usually get a confused stare. But the place is new and probably still working out the kinks. Aside from that, I dig it.
