this is a good place to get stuff like toys leashes and collars. they are more affordable than your small mom and pop shops. as far as dog food goes you are better off going to wag n wash they are at least 10 bucks cheaper if not more

I've been a premier silver member for the past few years and just got extended till 2020 so i consider myself a fan of the place. The location is so convenient for me plus i've had nothing but great experiences with the staff. If i've had any problems with an item there's no questions asked and they take it back.

great pizza i always get the brooklyn and am satisfied everytime. the only thing i think they can work on is their delivery times maybe. not sure why but it takes them a minimum of an hour to get the pizza to my apt even though i live only a couple blocks away.

great place to get the hardware you couldn't find at the bigger chains (home depot, lowes ie.). Every single employee i have spoke to has been very knowledgeable.

so far this is the only place i've come back to get a steak in town. I have yet to find a place in town that has a steak as tender as ruth chris's.     list of places i've gone to recently for comparison  mastro's city hall BLT  capital grill del frisco's hillstone houston's  STK (very close second best steak could be better but i need to go back :) ) gallahers (vegas)

it's not a very good airport they dot not have the  airlines listed next to the terminal signs when you enter the airport and you have to drive a couple miles if you wanted to rent a car. the inside is not all that in terminal 2,3 or 4.

very reasonable prices when using the gun range. I will definitely be coming back since i've gotten my kimber. as far as prices on their guns for sale there they are out of their minds.

this is my favorite course but due to the rude old man working the register i will never come back. me and another tee'd off at 6:22am (first group of the day) and were on track to complete the course in a little over 2 hours with another twosome following behind. we arrive to no. 9 tee box and the sprinklers are going off with maintenance all over the hole, no problem we'll play on to the next hole and go from there. Well the maintenance guy catches up with us and says they have maintenance working on 6 holes at a time and that we must play behind them, i told him ok and we decided that we were not going to wait and just go home. We went back to the clubhouse and requested our money back for 9 holes each and the old guy said "what are you doing playing in 2 hours?? thats not allowed!" WTF!?!?!? he said " you need to play in 3 hours minimum so you can give the maintenance guys a chance to do there job and i can't give you your money back". wow why have a tee time that early if you have to wait for maintenance?????

so the manager emailed me apologizing for his staff and fully refunding us. I wish i woul've never had to write this negative review in the first place because i truly love this place and would've hated not being able to come back due to the principle. kudos to bret for fixing the issue!!!!!!

I like coming here because it's only a block away from my place! the mall is pet friendly so we take our olde english bulldogges for a walk here and ocassionally stop at one of the establishments to eat.  the park has misters all over the place so it makes it alot more bearable during the summer nights.

This is definitely my favorite non-cibo pizza in town, for me it doesn't get much better then here. i normally get the meaty type pizza with extra basil on the side uncooked and the pizza always comes out so juicy (you wouldn't think of this as a good word to describe pizza but it is) and tasty.

This is probably the worst rib-eye steak I've ever had at a place that is suppose to be pretty good. according to their page they have the finest dry aged beef, i don't know where  this came from but that's a total lie. I asked for a rare steak and the steak was cooked to medium-medium rare, the steak was tough compared to ruth chris, capital grille hell even hillstone restaurants. the only reason i'm giving it 2-stars is because the staff was great and courteous

I decided to come here for my birthday and i'm glad i did, i had the ribeye with mashed potatoes. I ordered my ribeye rare which was cooked and seasoned very well. The steak though wasn't as tender as i thought it would be which surprised me maybe it was just not as good of a cut that day. the mashed potatoes though is another story i swear i was biting into clouds! those were some of the best mashed potatoes i've ever had.

best neopolitan pizza i've had in the states. The chef i believe is from caserta which is pretty cool. this is one of the only places i don't mind waiting to get seated and personally i like their food better than pizzeria bianco.

guys this is one of the few places that pays attention to their customers and listens to what they write on here. they are definitely stepping their game up adding more great food to their menu and also expanding their selection of fine top shelf liquors. this place is becoming more of a place that i want to have a casual drink at even if they don't have a football game or a ppv fight and thats what i thought  was lacking before. keep up the great work clay!

sometimes you just want to go to an old fashioned country style restaraunt and order some biscuits n gravy and don't need all the over the top fixins some of the other places put (hint hint: snooze putting carrots in their gravy realllllyyyyy?!?!?!?!) in their dishes. the place serves generous size portions and I am a fan!

I loved it here the smell of a non-smoking hotel was refreshing. the concierge was great in helping us get all our tickets for the shows we watched even though he did recommend the cirque du soleil show ka which i thought the name should've been changed to caca. the valet was great we just called from our room ahead of time and the car was down there everytime waiting on us. getting our luggage to our room was the only time consuming drawback. rooms were clean and they even organized our bathroom toiletries according to his and hers. i will be coming back

this gym is whack compared to the other ones i go to(chandler, tempe). I have been trying to figure out the best times to go and pretty much i've come to the conclusion that if you're not there at opening time dont waste your time. If your goals are to put in a good solid hour of no bullsh**t working out then this place is not for you. I swear there's a gotdamn fashion show going on while i'm here everytime. this place really takes the enjoyment out of going to the gym.

On a mission to find all the pet friendly restaurants in town...and hope we like their food. Hula's Modern Tiki makes the list. Great patio, nice ambient lighting, moderate traffic passing by, relaxed feel. I really like the "in the city" feel the restaurant has w/ Central traffic passing by. Started with the Samurai Beef Sticks: Excellent. tasty w/o being too much, juicy and the pineapple was good too. Main:Duke's Luau Pork plate, great. I would get it again. The date had a ribeye, he says it was just alright. His side of macaroni was so so delicious!!!! It is one of those dishes I crave. We know we like a place when we both say we would go back, especially for the mac & cheese! Giving it a 4 star until we can go back and try more menu items.

I love this place! the drinks are nice and stout and are definitely not watered down. somehow I always show up on thursdays so i get the special which is the prime rib (rare). the steak is very good but at first i  questioned it not coming with au jus but don't worry it doesn't need it, it is that good. the bruschetta is the best i've had in phoenix the cheese is outstanding and the tomatoes very flavorful. i've already been here quite a few times and i seem to never get tired of it.

where do i start well first off we had reservations and when we showed up the hostess wanted to make sure that we were out by 8 since they had live music and i guess they weren't much of a fan at the idea of kids being there.  i decided to order the spaghetti with sweet italian sausage or so i thought. the sausage was so over cooked it looked almost like slim jim beef sticks in my pasta. the wine selection was very lacking i decided to get their most expensive bottle of wine which came in at 21 dollars and tasted watered down.

I came here for a corporate function on a saturday and i tell you what I am a fan! The DJ was outstanding. We decided to have the never ending mimosas and mind erasers so i can't really be a good judge of character on the food due to being a little tipsy but i did have the breakfast taco plate and it was pretty darn good, i will be returning for sure.

i love it here very contemporary compared to the bellagio and some of the other high end casinos. when i walk in i look around and feel like there's an age limit, 35 years and younger. i will be returning even if at the time i'm over 35 just to feel young and hip.

its located in a strip mall so i didn't expect much but upon entering their establishment i couldn't be any more wrong. it is a contemporary place with some pretty cool art in there. their chorizo, egg and potato is pretty good but i really like their street taco asadas.

So I've been searching for a peruvian restaurant to fill that empty void in my life since contigo peru closed and whaddya know i finally found it! The chef from contigo peru is the chef at this new restaurant Tumi.  We ordered the papa ala huancaina for an appetizer and as usual it was outstanding. For main courses I had the tallarin verde (peruvian pesto sauce w/pasta) and bisteck (pan fried steak) and my girlfriend had the chaufa de pollo (chicken fried rice), both meals were outstanding in flavor and very generous in portions. I am and will be always a loyal customer of this chef and wherever he cooks.

great place to hang out upstairs on the patio this time of the year. Their cheesesteak egg rolls are the greatest appetizers i've had there. i normally get the ribeye there which they season and cook just right (i order mine rare). The only disappointing meal i've had there was the stroganoff it was really salty other than that definitely a great place to hang out and even watch a football game.
