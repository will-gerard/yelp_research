The only reason I go to this location is strictly out of convenience, but after today I will inconvenience myself to drive to another location. The ONLY reason we went to this location today was because we decided at the last minute to get Chipotle, now I wish we went to the location off Rural and Baseline I believe.   First off the place was a hot mess today. Food ALL OVER the floor in the dining area. Yes there were kids there and I know they can be messy but WOW food, rice and paper(yes I said paper, did not know that paper was on the menu, must be new) was all over the floor. Ya know I don't expect places to be completely spotless by any means but at the same time it's just not appealing to see stuff all over the place.   Second, the customer service or should I say lack of customer service. If I wanted attitude and nasty looks by the employees I'd go to the MVD because you know everyone there hates their job and has no issue sharing/displaying that to others. The first guy in the food was just gave me a look of "yeah lady I know what the "f" I'm doing" with slight attitude, I move along and get my carnitas, beans and rice slightly annoyed. THEN comes the guy that puts the salsa, cheese sour cream and whatever  else you might want. Once again I get the same look as the last guy, just a little more dominant accompanied by MORE attitude. This guy also decides to OBVIOUSLY completely miss my taco with the sour cream and put in in between the two. Thank you guy, I really didn't want it on my taco, I like to eat it by itself. At this point I just want to get my food and leave.   Third, I will have to say that this trip was better than the last. The last one, my boyfriend had to practically hold me back from completely lashing out at the VERY incompetent employee behind the counter. My order REALLY isn't that difficult and I really don't understand why it was sooo hard to comprehend. I always get the three tacos on corn with carnitas, pinto beans, white rice, corn salsa(extra), sour cream(extra) and cheese(extra)(I have to get extra because they never want to put an actual decent amount of any of those three on the food). The only thing I ask to be different is to place the tacos in the bowl instead of the foil because I don't want to EAT foil. Anyways, the first guy that was making my order just simply could not for the life of him understand what I was asking and on top of that was VERY VERY nasty/mean to me. Worse than a three year old throwing a tantrum. It was absolutely awful including the taste of the food!! I ended up throwing it away after just a couple of bites!!   Last but not least, I have worked in the customer service for about 15 years now in one way or another. I know what it's like to have difficult, mean, unruly and just downright mean people. I also know not to take it personally and just bite my tongue because arguing with the customer is just adding fuel to the fire and will just not go anywhere for me or the customer. After all that being said, the way we were treated and the way horrible way the food was prepared, there is not anything(and I mean nothing) in this world that will ever bring me back to this location.   Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me, fool me thrice, yeah...No not gonna happen! All in all this location is horrible, rude and messy. People have asked me where the nearest Chipotle is and I only tell them about the location on Rural, there is NO reason I should tell them about this one. Thank you for reading/listening to my rant.

Came here looking for a tablet. JUST wanted to look around and see what was available. Even if I did find what I was looking for, there would have been ABSOLUTELY NO WAY I would have purchased it here. I was approached and asked if I needed any help/assistance 5 times in less than 7 minutes.  Three of those times were by the same women. Seriously?!?! You people are worse than a used car lot. By the 3rd time being approached, I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I had no interest in looking or being there in general. Its one thing to be approached once or twice, but FIVE times in less than 7 minutes is down right ridiculous! While I was there, I did have to use the women's restroom and WOW!!!!! Ive been to run down nasty gas stations with cleaner bathrooms than this place. I honestly couldnt believe how dirty it was. Obviously the only people that actually work there are the absolutely annoying tablet sales people!

I've been doing some research on finding a salon to go to, to get my haircut. Like most women, I am VERY picky and nervous about getting my haircut and don't trust just anyone to do it. In my research I have noticed that trying to get someone on the phone at OTHER salons is somewhat of a challenge. Which just made my anxiety of finding a place even higher.  So, let's get started.... I called Cloud Nine this morning around 11:30am and I couldn't believe it, the phone rang MAYBE 1 1/2 times before someone picked up. I'm thinking ok, that's a good start. The receptionist on the line was VERY nice and polite. She was informative, friendly and above all actually caring. I told her what I was looking to get done and asked for a price range. She told me the price and asked when I would like to come in. I askedif there was anything available today. I completely expected her to say no, well I was wrong. I got an apt for 12:30. So at this point I'm thinking either I just got lucky or I'm gonna regret going to this place....  I get there a couple minutes before 12:30, I check in and sit down expecting to be there waiting a while. Receptionist again VERY friendly and polite. Offered me and my boyfriend a drink. Not more than maybe 2 minutes later Brittany, my stylist, comes up to get me to bring me back to the chair and she offers my boyfriend to come back with us(totally cool because not many places actually offer that).   So we get to the chair and get started. She asks what I want done and to be honest, I'm kinda clueless as to what I want done except that I want to keep as much of the length as possible yet have a new and noticeably new look. She offers up her suggestions, which I take but make it a point that she thinks we should start off longer than I want at first, just incase because we can always cut it shorter later, we can't cut it longer after its cut already. It's a great idea and she is totally right especially since I am very sensitive/particular about my hair to begin with.   Next we move to the shampoo/conditioning station. At this point I'm a little nervous so to speak about how my remaining time with her will go. I'm wondering "is she going to talk to me, is it going to be completely awkward or is she going to just plain talk my head off?" Conversation starts, which is very pleasant and enjoyable, as well as the little massage given while washing/conditioning. Whatever she did sent chills down my spine and made me completely relaxed.   Now that that's over we move to the stylist chair, conversation continues as well. I come to find out we have a lot in common. I felt so comfortable and confident with Brittany that I just let her do her thing without really paying attention(which I NEVER have done in my entire life when getting my hair done). She worked her magic with y hair, continued with reasonable amount of conversation, no awkwardness what so ever, even gave me compliments about my hair and best of all, she didn't push to try to sell me anything at all!! Brittany is also very knowledgeable about what to do and what not to do. She also didn't push to do anything with my hair that incident want. She respected me, my hair and my way of doing things, which I can't say about a lot of places.   Cut, blow-dry and style is done, she hands me the mirror and turns me around. WOW! I am beautiful!! My hair is perfect. I couldn't believe it. Brittany is absolutely amazing. She is kind, caring, informative and above all did everything I asked for. She understood where I was coming from, had funny stories she shared, was appropriately personable, made me very comfortable and very pleasant to be around. I couldn't have asked for anything better!!  I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone. Prices are VERY reasonable, staff is polite and respectful, salon is clean, comfortable to be in/very inviting and noise level is pleasant, not too loud and not too quiet. It's not some high upscale intimidating, don't touch anything, snotty staff, overpriced kind of place. Which I avoid like the plague. They also offer many other services, such as massages, facials, mani/pedi and waxing. I have every intention on trying the massages, mani/pedi and possibly a facial sometime in the near future. They do have packaged deals as well as gift cards and a client reward system! So if you are looking for anything I mentioned above, I highly recommend this place, I REALLY don't think you will be disappointed!

We went here a couple weeks ago(just forgot to leave a review). Great place, great prices! Very welcoming and very knowledgeable! Customer service is everything to me and they have it. I've only been to a few places so far and this place has been my #1. They all have a sense of humor and try very hard to engage in conversation with everyone there, especially new people. Going back today to get some more awesome flavors for some awesome prices! I highly recommend this place to anyone, newbies and experts.
