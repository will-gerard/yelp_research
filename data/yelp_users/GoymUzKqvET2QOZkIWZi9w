Wonderful food and great service.   I love that they always have a different soup every time we come, which is served before the salad that's included with our entrée. If there's something you need to change with your meal, that's not a problem. They are very accommodating and will go above and beyond to make sure your experience is top notch.

A large group (17) of us came in for NYE and it was fabulous as always.  We started off with a bunch of appetizers for the table followed by soup then salad.  The soup that evening was some sort of mushroom, artichoke, potato combination that was out of this world and if anyone has the recipe, please send it to me!  The salad was the same as always, nothing spectacular but it serves the purpose.   On to the entrees, they had a prix-fixe menu as they do for all major holidays. There were A LOT of seafood options, but no vegetarian (they were able to accommodate but it wasn't listed) and only one chicken option. I was hoping to see at least 2 chicken options for those of us who don't love breaded chicken. There were also a lot of beef and pork options.  The chicken was similar to a Cordon Bleu without the ham, served with gnocchi and some sort of cheese sauce on top. I loved it but others in the party didn't care for it as much as some of the other options you can get when it's not a holiday.   We then finished with desert.   Service was wonderful, the food was great and we will definitely be back.

We stopped in here previously to meet some friends who were dying for the burger they used to have on the menu. Once we realize you don't have the burger anymore, the gin told us to go elsewhere. But, I have been DYING to have the Chicken Wonton Soup ever since.   So my bf and I came in for dinner last night. We started off with the crispy spring rolls which were awesome, my only complaint was having to share them. I don't like sharing.   I obviously ordered the wonton soup and he ordered some noodle dish. Since my soup came out 5 minutes before his meal, I was finished and staring at him eat, which I'm sure was quite annoying. Oh well, it caused him to offer to share his dinner with me and it was yummy!!  We took a vote after we left and decided to add this place into our rotation.

I've came and picked up pazaki the past few years on Fat Tuesday, this year to make sure my parents had some we tried to come in the day before. Unfortunately they were closed, I think it was a poor decision to be closed the day prior to Fat Tuesday, now my mom is stuck eating grocery store "doughnuts".

Saturday afternoon was my first time here...but not my last!  When we walked in there was a rambunctious group of OLD LADIES talking about the importance of a good support bra while taking pictures of their chests! I couldn't agree more!!  I can not comment on the price of the drinks since we sent the guys to open a tab, but I can comment on the heavy hand that poured my drinks. Kudos to you!!  My only regret is not having came here sooner to experience Christmas at the Swizzle.

I've had nights where I'd give it a 5 star and nights I wouldn't give it a 1 star, but whenever it's been bad they always do whatever they can to fix it.

My fiancé and I had to head to Minnesota for a funeral and needed his suit cleaned in a hurry. I used Yelp to pull up a place close to the house with good reviews and this seemed like the best location.   I dropped his suit off on my way to work and it was done when I picked it up (before the time they stated). We were both very impressed with how great of a job they did.   I'll certainly be back in the future for my dry cleaning needs.

I needed a backup, for emergencies only sort of account, somewhere I could put money and forget about it until the day rolled around I needed it. It was a mistake getting it from BOA.  I need to take some of the blame though, I am the one who opened a BOA account and didn't realize I needed to have paperless billing or I would be charged $9 A MONTH. After many months have passed I finally checked my statement to realize I didn't have enough in savings (the majority was all in checking) which charged me an additional $5, so for months I have been being charged $14.  I'm willing to take responsibility for that. But, I do think it's pretty crappy to charge someone that much a month in fees!  I stopped in this branch yesterday to close the account and was surprised how little they seemed to care. We exchanged greetings and chatted about our Halloween and what each of us were doing. I told him I needed to close both my savings and checking account, he said OK and printed off the paperwork no questions asked. Really? No Questions? This bothered me more than the fees, he never asked me why I'm closing the account, never asked if there was anything he could do to keep me a member, seemed pretty happy to let me go. I've heard this from other people, BOA just doesn't care about their members. If he would have asked why I was leaving and asked to look at my account to see how we could eliminate fees from that point forward I may have considered staying a member, but to no avail, he just didn't care.

I'm sticking to my 5-star review! I don't understand why this place has a horrible star rating.   We've been here a dozen times and it's always great. I've never had a bad meal or bad service.   We came in again last night for dinner and like normal we get the 2 for $20 deal. We always get the chips, salsa and guacamole. I'm unsure why someone would just order the chips and salsa when you can get the amazing guac for the same price. I'm not kidding on it being amazing, it's loaded with yummy avocados and CORN.   James ordered the fajitas and had comments like, "wow, these onions are cooked perfectly" and "mmmmm this chicken sure is good".   I had the grilled chicken salad, it's the right amount of food for the price.   We'll be back...many more times!

This location is a joke!   I canceled my membership 2 weeks ago and unfortunately I had to escalate my problem to corporate. I canceled online and had the option of mailing the cancelation form or dropping it off by 5 pm. I went in and the manager Parag wasn't there, he went home early. So I left it with someone else who assured me Parag would do it first thing in the morning -keep in mind this guy never asked why I was canceling my membership, never asked to see what they could do to get me to stay, just said ok I'll give it to him. A little after noon the next day I called to find out the hold up. Parag said it's up to him if it gets canceled and he needs to review it first. IT'S NOT UP TO YOU! At no point does anyone within this company get to decide if I'm canceling my membership. I'm not under a contract. I paid my first and last months up front. You have my money and I'm not giving you anymore. He was unbelievably rude and condescending, he kept interrupting me and was clearly stationed on his high horse.  So I called corporate who instantly canceled my membership.   The reasons I canceled:  Good luck working out between the hours of 5-7 during the week, you will wait and wait and wait to use any non-cardio machine. If you wanna prance on a treadmill chances are you can get one easily. But, if you're into strength training...good luck!   My biggest problem with this gym is the hours. They close at 8 on Sundays and 10 Fridays and Saturdays. Seriously??   The sales reps they call personal trainers are pushy and rude. I was told by corporate they are able to sell individual training courses but according to the folks here they can only do the one year training membership...stop lying to your customers!!

WOW!!  We couldn't decide where to have lunch so we based it on Yelp reviews and I'm happy to report, everyone was right!   We shared the greek salad and a pizza. First off a medium was too large for the two of us, especially getting it as a deep dish.   We will definitely be back ASAP!!

Came in last night for FREE Blooming Onions. We went straight to the bar area and ordered our onion, mushrooms and two side salads.   First off the Blooming Onion is always looks fantastic but that sauce is horrible. I get that some people like horseradish but to me it's a taste that I can never get out of my mouth. I don't know who you folks are that like horseradish, but I just can't trust you.   The mushrooms were awesome as always! We even took half of the order home and warmed them up in the oven for a snack.  However, the salads were kind of pathetic and not worth $3.99 each. I loved the croutons though. But, the salad was very small with cheap iceburg lettuce.   Service was top notch. We never went without a refill and he checked back after everything he brought us.

Great Salsa!  While driving down Cactus we had a sudden craving for Mexican food and stopped at the first place we found.   We were seated immediately and had wonderful service, I saved the receipt so I could remember to put her name in my review but I can't find it. Once I do...I'll let ya know!  We had a slew of folks that helped bring drinks, chips, salsa and everything else that we needed. I was pretty impressed with the level of service we received.   The ONLY downfall is not having an Italian dressing that's not creamy. No one likes creamy dressing. Please get a true vinaigrette  on your menu. I loved your taco salad but didn't have a good dressing to put on it. I promise to add this to my roatation if you do.

This ACE Hardware has it all. If you want a blender, some dishes, candles, a Christmas Tree, you name it...they've got it.   I've been in a few times over the duration of my North Phoenix living and I gotta say, Ace is definitely the place!

Why is it pizza joints in the middle of a shopping plaza always taste the best? We've driven past this place for years and always thought it was a great name but didn't stop in for dinner until a random Thursday night for Open Mic night.  My husband and I each had a side salad and we split a large pizza (with food to take home). The pizza was wonderful and so was the service.  My only complaint was the salad dressing was nothing spectacular but other than that, wowzers. We will definitely be back.

We came in Saturday with a Deal Chicken voucher. The service was AMAZING! We had a private booth behind a curtain and despite having to move tables because our burner was broken, we couldn't have asked for better service.   The spinach and artichoke fondue was wonderful, the salads were good but the entrée was Meh, as soon as it came I dropped a couple potatoes to get them going, by the time we were done eating the potatoes still weren't done which is a huge disappointment. I wish they would partially cook them first.   The ravioli was wonderful.    We didn't get desert because we were too full. Next time.

Garage doors are not supposed to open and close whenever they want, they're also not supposed to grind really loud and then emit a puff of smoke as they slowly die. But, I caught it on video, so it was totally worth it!  I sent the video to the guy who owns my house and he quickly called Lodi (the number was on my garage door). They called me that day to schedule an appointment, unfortunately I travel for work so we had to make it for the following weekend. I like they didn't charge additional for a Saturday appointment.   We scheduled a time of 1-3 as I was running a 5K that morning and wasn't sure if I would require hospitalization after since I am out of shape and it was my first one (I survived).    At 12:30ish I received a call from the tech asking if it would be more convenient for me if he came early instead of the hours of 1-3. The way he asked was very polite and he made it all about me (great quality in a guy) instead of insisting he come early since it was easier for him.   He was there in literally minutes and I'm lead to believe he called me from outside my house.   He was extremely friendly and efficient (not to mention easy on the eyes). He was in and out in just over an hour. He only provided one remote with the install but after insisting I needed two, he grabbed one from his truck.   Because of his professional behavior and how he seemed to go above and beyond I would definitely recommend Lodi in the future.

We decided to have a litte staycation and stay at the Hampton. We made a great choice, the staff was friendly, the beds were comfy and the breakfast was pretty good. The only problem we had was the jacuzzi tub took forever to fill, but once filled it was heaven =)

All the MSU family members stayed here for our bowl game, and was beyond impressed with the manager Tim. When we showed up to check in he was wearing an MSU shirt with other stuff on display in the lobby! That was awesome!  Some of the family members flew 2,000 miles away into the heart of a much different conference and to see your team's school colors everywhere in the hotel meant a lot to us. It showed that we weren't just another group of people, we were treated like family!  I am local to the valley and the next time I need a staycation I will definitely be booking my reservation here because of Tim. Granted the rest of his staff went above and beyond but his friendly, helpful and caring demeanor sealed the deal for us.   The kicker is: he's not even an MSU fan. He borrowed the clothing/decorations from a friend who is a fan =)

I came in on Valentine's Day to pick up some eyeliner. I bee-lined it for the Smashbox only to find out they were out of the color I wanted. Within seconds a guy stopped over to ask if I needed help with anything, he said he would go check in the back for me. In the time frame I was standing there, three others stopped to ask if I needed any help. None of them were pushy, just willing and able to help.  Luckily he found my eyeliner and then asked if I've seen how their new eyeliner works and gave me a quick demo. I wish I would have gotten his name, he was so helpful and friendly (he did have a pretty neat tattoo on his neck).    Kudos to the staff on 2/14/14!!

My boyfriend keeps talking about his friends from Cuba that moved away a few years ago wishing I had the opportunity to try their cooking.   So when Groupon had a deal for this place, he scooped it up hoping it was even half as good as what he's used to. Happy to report, it was fantastic.   I wasn't extremely hungry so I ordered Sopa de Polo and Frituras de Frijoles Negros. The soup was a little on the bland side so I ended up using a lot of pepper and a dash of salt, nothing I couldn't fix. The black bean fritters were amazing!   I can't remember what he had but he kept saying "wow, this is good" and "this is exactly how I remembered".  We will defintely be back.

I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars.  3 for the pizza, it's not fantastic. Maybe it's because I prefer Brick Oven style pizzas, but these pizzas lack flavor. I've been here on a couple different occasions and left unimpressed both times.  But, the service is 5 stars without a doubt. They're super friendly, will strike up a conversation with anyone, about anything. From the second you walk in the door to the moment you leave the staff here is wonderful.

I'm here enough I was greeted by my first name last week.   The service is always phenomenal, the smoothies always taste the same (I'm addicted the Apples & Greens) but the pretzels are hit or miss. Twice now there hasn't actually been cheese in the cheese stuffed pretzels =\

Never consistent.   I was in twice this week. On my first visit I ordered a potato, chicken nuggets and a kids size frosty. I paid at the first window and when I reached the second they tried to collect money from me, when I informed her I already paid at the first window she asked if I was sure that I already paid. I wasn't OK with her implying I was lying about paying for my lunch. After all that confusion they handed me my lunch, told me to have a nice day and I drove away. One I got about 10 feet ahead I realized they never handed me my frosty but at this point it was too late. A car was already at the window and since it's lunch time the parking lot was a disaster and I wasn't going back.   My second visit was yesterday, I ordered a kids meal but it didn't have a toy inside. While this isn't a huge deal to me since it was for myself. But, if I had a kid in the back seat waiting on a toy, I'd be pretty upset.   In previous visits I'm usually missing an item 2 out of 5 times. Whether it's butter for my potato, dressing for my salad or a straw for my drink.

I came in for lunch with two co-workers. It's a darn good thing we weren't in a hurry because lunch took FOREVER. We sat at a booth in the bar area, the bartender came up pretty quickly to get our drink orders but didn't bring menus. I asked him if they had watermelon margaritas and his response was "I don't think so". So I asked if he could find out, his uncertainty immediately changed to "nope, we don't have that flavor". I ordered my drink, which was supposed to be a normal size, not the world's largest margarita. Oh well, what's a few more dollars, right? We sat without chips/salsa for quite sometime.  Our lunch took forever and when it finally came, I wasn't impressed. It was probably the worst taco salad I've ever had. The chicken was luke warm at best. It lacked flavor.  I had to ask for the guacamole I ordered when I ordered the salad.  My friend's burrito looked NOTHING like the photo. It looked like it had those kraft single serve cheese slices melted on top.   All and all. It's not worth coming back since I value my time and my taste buds.   The peach margarita was fantastic though.

Consistently Inconsistent.   Some days I come here for lunch and think "WOW, why don't I come here more often" and other times, I ponder the greatest question of all, "Why did I come back?"   I love the Forest Mushroom Soup, I think it's fan-freaking-tastic.  I do not love the bread it comes with, it's often rock hard as if it's been sitting out for days.   I love the fruit salad.  I do not love that unless you read the whole menu you will never know it comes with yogurt. So if you can't have dairy or you just think it's gross to have yogurt all over your grapes, you won't be pleased.   I love the sweet potato sandwich.  I hate that it's never the same. Sometimes it's dry, other times there's no fennel. UGH   The folks at the registers are rarely friendly but the folks who package up my lunch incorrectly are usually super nice. It's the little things, like when the cashier asks if I want utensils to go and there aren't any. Or they don't include the banana bread with the fruit salad, sometimes I get it, sometimes I don't.

You know those mornings you wake up, look in the mirror and realize your eyebrows are out of control and they certainly didn't look that way when you went to bed? I was having one of those days so while I was picking up lunch from Wildflower I noticed a sign at the nail place next door saying they do eyebrow waxing. I've got $10 and some time to spare, what could go wrong? Nothing we wrong actually. They weren't busy so I got them done instantly, she was quick and to the point.  My only complaint was when I went to pay, I wanted to add the tip to the credit card receipt but was told I couldn't do that and needed to go find cash. So out to my car I went (while she held on to my card) to find a few bucks.   I've continued coming here 4-5 more times and each time by eyebrows look great.   I have yet to get a mani/pedi but from what I've seen, they do a great job as well.

This was my first time at this location. Normally I dine at the one on indian bend. Maybe it was just me but the "buffet" had fewer options.  I got my food to go. I got the large bowl and filled it to the point I could barely carry my tray. I ended up with two large containers, plus a small container for rice, and a drink. The gentleman at the door was very helpful. He asked if I wanted a container for soup, I didn't because the soups were not vegetarian. I would like to see them have one meat based and one without. Other than that they definitely carter to vegetarians, they have a card you can take so the guys will clean the grill prior to preparing your food in case of allergies or you simply don't want your tofo/veggie creation cooked in meat. I would also prefer little cups to pour my sauces in rather than in the bowl to gain a better picture of how much sauce I'm using vs actually need.  For just under ten dollars I have food for 2-3 meals.

This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. So much we just came here two days in a row.   When you sit down they bring everyone a glass of water and chips and salsa for everyone which is a mild and a hot (which isn't very hot). The chips are thick with just the right amount of salt. I could eat them for days! The food is always piping hot and comes out really fast.  The service isn't always personable but it's always efficient. We've never had a bad meal or bad service. We'll definitely be back.

There was a group of around 35 Browns fans that came in to watch the game week one. Some of these Browns Backers members have been coming here for a long time and we decided to join them.   Pros: Bloody Mary Bar  Cons: Everything else. Right before kick off the owner/manager decided he wasn't going to have the sound on for the Browns game as promised. He stated that despite the fact there are far more Browns fans in the bar than anyone else we are consistently cheap! Seriously? We're Browns fans...WE EAT AND DRINK A LOT!!  So he decided to appease a small amount of fans in the corner that wanted to hear their game.  Since we had already ordered a bunch of drinks and food for the 4 in our little group we decided to stay until the half. Slowly most started leaving to head to another bar. By the time we ate our pizza that tasted too much like flour and downed our drinks we also left. Our close to $100 tab would have been double that if we had stayed for the whole game.   The unbelievably rude manager lost out on a lot of money and a lot of future business.   We will NEVER be back!

We were excited when our closest Sweet Tomatoes location was reopening, however, we won't be coming back. We will continue going to the locations that weren't turned into a Field Kitchen at one point.  The salad bar is missing way too many items, the beverage area is too small/awkward and the soup/potato area is also a squeeze (and I'm a small person).   It's not worth having to wait in line for soup, not having enough items on the salad bar and being unable to get to the ice machine because people are piled up around the ice cream.

I have a rule against leaving a 1 star review before a cooling off period. I've cooled off and I'm still upset.   Knowing I was heading out of town on vacation, I booked an appointment at my regular salon but the powers to be at work had other plans for my lunch hour. So I had to cancel with my stylist, but since I had left the house with my hair in a messy ponytail, I knew I at least needed to get it washed/styled before I hopped on the plane.   In a pinch I called this place and scheduled a trim and a style. I don't normally get my hair cut elsewhere, but I have long straight hair, how could someone screw up a 1" trim? Oh she screwed it up with ease.   I'm not a cosmetologist but I've had my hair cut enough times to know the right way and the wrong way to cut it. We agreed to cut the bare minimum off, she showed me my hair between her fingers as a visual and I agreed and inch at the most was best. 3+ INCHES LATER my hair is a lot shorter. I knew from the way she sectioned off my hair I was rolling the dice, but I figured, the piece of paper on the wall that says she's trained, would indicate she can pull this off, that piece of paper lied.   When she was about done destroying my hair, her next client came up and inquired how much longer. She was told it would only be a couple more minutes, so I asked the stylist how she's going to be done in a couple min when she still has to dry and style my hair. She said my apt was only booked for a hair cut, no blow dry, no styling or anything else. Seriously? I made it crystal clear I needed to walk out of there with a finished look. In a snobby tone she said "I can dry it but it's going to cost you $16". The tone implied I should just leave with wet hair. So I tipped her way more than average because the stories I had to hear made me feel sorry for her and left.   So instead of running a quick errand and heading to the airport, I had to hurry home and dry/style my hair. When I left the salon with wet hair I wasn't able to clearly see how horrible my hair cut was. Once dried, I could see the random chunks of long hair and the chunks of hair that were cut too short. I've never in all my years had such a chop job. A blind person could have given me a better hair cut.   So while sitting in my bathroom crying, I called my brother's fiancé who has her cosmetology license and asked where she was. Luckily she was at home, so we rushed to her house for her to at least make it look like I didn't have a child trim my hair. She was able to partially fix it, but the problem is, once hair is cut off there's not a lot you can do about it besides cut the rest of the hair to match.  Never. Ever. Ever. Ever. Ever again will I get my hair cut here.

We came in for dinner Tuesday. Our server new but he did a great job.  We started out with the mushrooms off the bar menu which are always amazing, my bf ordered steak and lobster. Being from Maine he's very picky and unfortunately this lobster didn't meet his standards. Oddly enough he blamed the majority of the problem on the butter. He wouldn't order the lobster again but he would definitely order the filet, it was cooked perfectly.   I wasn't super hungry so I only ordered a baked potato and some mixed veggies. I appreciate they don't drown the veggies in butter.

I was on a mission to find The Eagles Greatest Hits 1971-1975. Should be an easy find right? NO! After multiple stores across the valley from Gilbert to Scottsdale to random places in the Avenues, I ended up here. I checked the "E's" and the new stuff when some  bubbly chick with purple hair asked if I needed help. Apparently, I looked frustrated. I told her what I was in search of and after checking the computer and talking to her vinyl manager, she ended up searching all the bins on the ground with me. She didn't have to but she did to help a girl out. Granted, we didn't find it but the time she spent helping me search was going above and beyond. I can barely remember all the places I've been looking for this album (besides the place I finally found it), but this place sticks out the most because of her help.  Next time I'm in search of something, I'll definitely be coming here first. Top notch service!!

We had family in from out of town and it just seemed like too much work to cook for 12 on Easter so we made a reservation at Claim Jumper.  Our table was all set up and ready for us before our scheduled reservation time, so we sat quickly and was able to start getting our cocktail orders in.  The bread. Oh good gosh, that bread. I couldn't stop eating it.  It's as if they combined crack and yeast then tossed on some butter and cheese.   I ordered the portabella mushroom sandwich with fries. I've had it before and it's never disappointed. But, I took one bite and the whole table could see something was wrong. It tasted horrible and had a thick slime. UGH.  So I motioned for the server who quickly asked what she can bring me instead. Since I was torn between the mushroom sandwich and the pulled chicken sandwich, I ordered that. It came out in a hurry and was fantastic.   My brother ordered a steak med-rare, unfortunately it was VERY well done. If you wanted a well done steak you may actually think they cooked it too much. So naturally he asked for a new one. The manager brought out a new one pretty quickly and my brother cut into it then asked the manager what cut it was. The manager quickly responded "rare". It was bright red and bloody.  At this point, everyone was half done with their dinners so he simply said, no need to bring out a third steak or toss this back on the grill.    My mother ordered shrimp and ribs. The ribs looked fantastic. The shrimp which she asked to be very well done, was undercooked. So she had to get new shrimp.   So why the 4 stars? The manager Tim.  They could have just recooked our food and barely acknowledged their errors, but he was fantastic. He kneeled down next to me so I could clarify some errors and ensure him we're not trying to be difficult but his kitchen screwed up big time. He adjusted our check and sincerely apologized.   Our server was sweet. I can't for the life of me remember her name. but I'm sure she won't soon forget our table. I appreciated her responding so quickly to our issues and getting them resolved.   We've been here many times before this and will continue to come back. Hopefully the kitchen got a stern lecture.   But, honestly, if it wasn't for Tim, I think the experience would have left such a negative impression, I probably wouldn't have been in a rush to come back. But, given how great the whole front of the house staff is, we'll be back for sure!!

I hate hate hate seafood. I can't stand the taste or the smell. So I have been fighting my boyfriend for years about coming here.   I finally gave in and holy cow I was impressed. It didn't smell horrible at all (it did the one other time I came many moons ago).   I ordered the chicken with a portabella wine sauce, mashed potatoes and green beans. HOLY GOODNESS IT'S AMAZING!!!   My biggest complaint is they had NO Italian or Balsamic Vinaigrette dressings. Blueberry or Raspberry isn't a realistic trade off.    I will be back for sure.

I love this place!  You must either cook or freeze the fruits and veggies within a day or two but it's always worth it. A cart full of groceries for under $20. Worth the drive.

It's been a few years since I've been at The Good Egg. I don't remember if I didn't like it or was just underwhelmed and opted to not go back.   I can't say that about this visit. WOW, I left full, impressed and wanting to go back ASAP!  We came in around 10 am on a Sunday morning so we expected a brief wait, it wasn't bad, maybe 10 minutes at the most. After being shown to our table we were greeted by a super friendly girl named Tarisa. I ordered the mushroom caps and she quickly had a suggestion for me. Apparently there are mushroom caps that aren't on the menu that have feta, mozzarella, tomatoes and pesto. Sure, why not! I appreciated the suggestion and liked all the ingredients she listed. The only problem was, I couldn't have imagined they were going to taste so phenomenal.  Without her suggestion, I never would have left that happy. I will be back SOON and will not even consider ordering something else. I didn't care about the eggs, potatoes and English Muffin, granted it was all wonderful but the star was the mushrooms. Please put those mushrooms on the menu!!   Tarisa's phenomenal service has gained your restaurant a repeat guest!!

After a long day of wedding dress shopping with my brother's fiancé and her sisters, we were tired and starving.  I was craving Avocado Egg Rolls so I insisted on stopping by Kona. We entered through the mall entrance and proceeded to head upstairs to the bar area outside so we could just seat ourselves and enjoy the beautiful weather.  To our delight we found out Happy Hour is all day Sunday. Wahhh-hooooo!!  So in addition to my Avocado Egg Rolls I was also able to try the Chicken Potsticker and they were amazing. First off, thank you for having chicken, too many places have pork and I just don't do pork. I wasn't expecting them to be so crispy, but they were fantastic.   I couldn't tell you what the other ladies had because I was enjoying every last bite of my late lunch to pay attention.   Knowing there's Happy Hour all day Sunday will likely cause me to rearrange my schedule so I can get two appetizers for the price of one!

Ehhhhh.   My boyfriend and I met up with a buddy for happy hour last Friday. He got there first and said he already ordered a beer and some wings. When I asked what flavor wings, he had no idea because he wasn't given any options. He asked for wings and she said OK and walked away and he was left to wonder what he's about to get.  After she came over to take our drink order, I was left to ask the guys if she spoke any English because she couldn't seem to understand us nor did she actually say more than one word at a time.   It was horrible service!!  When I checked in on Yelp, I was given a coupon for a free drink. So when I tried presenting it to her when we asked for the checks she had no idea what it said, so I explained it and that was like talking to wall.   The wings were tasty, but had no sauce. Do you offer sauce??  The beers were cheap, but it was like pulling teeth to order one.   I can't think of a good reason to stop in again.

The best thing about this place is being able to get a passport on a Saturday afternoon!   When I arrived for my 10 am appointment, I was told by a real snippy lady that it was going to be a while since she was backed up. OK, I've got nothing but time to wait....  When I finally got called back she took my photo, a horrible photo. She was standing above me so I'm looking up. You can see the white in the bottom of my eyes and I'm all "cheek". A normal person would have taken the photo head on. When I asked about why it's such an awkward angle, she huffed and said she could retake it if I absolutely need to. No worries lady, I'll just spend the next decade with a horrible passport photo.   She was quick but good golly she needed a snickers bar to improve her mood.  The website says it's $10 for a photo, it's actually $12. Don't bother telling her that though...  5 stars for getting my passport on a Saturday 2 stars for your crappy attitude.

I'm confused by these great reviews. I stopped in to talk to them about a wedding cake and to sample some cupcakes. The ladies hovered and butted in on the conversation between me and my mother. When I told her the date, she huffed like I was inconveniencing her. And, when we got home the cupcakes were old and dry.   The place smelled great, I'll give them that.   But, their customer service is lacking and so is their food.

My mom owns a dog who putting it mildly is a horribly snippy little thing. I can't even imagine someone willingly putting their hands near her face to trim her hair and brush her teeth while expecting to keep all their digits. Well, Vicki is that brave soul who not only can handle this little Maltese but she does a fantastic job.  Her rates are reasonable, the place is very clean and she goes above and beyond. I would reccomend this salon to all my friends with pets.

We've been to Dillon's many times but this was our first time at this location, given how close it is to Sun City it explains why we were the youngest couple in there (we're in our 30's). My boyfriend keeps buying the Groupons and we keep coming back. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the Groupons we wouldn't come here, but for the price we pay it's a great deal.   This particular visit we started with the breaded mushrooms, they were good, we were able to choose between regular ranch and a chipotle ranch, we went with both.   James ordered the pulled pork with sweet heat like always and I decided to try something new. I ordered the taco salad with chicken and wow was it tasty! That chicken was amazing, it's different than the chicken used in the chicken sandwich. The only thing that could have made it better was guacamole.   We had a table in the back by the window so we got to watch the bunnies. I am, however, deeply concerned about the one that looks like it has a huge tumor on its neck. Has anyone gotten that checked out??

We have a friend who said the salsa is way too hot. All I heard was "you must try Los Dos Molinos". We love spicy food and are always up to a challenge.   It wasn't very busy when we got here so we were seated at a large booth in the middle. I started with a margarita and normally in flavored frozen margarita you often wonder if they forgot the tequila. Not here, wow it had quite the punch to it. I'm excited to find a place that can make a great margarita without skimping on the liquor.   Yes, the salsa is hot and yes, you're going to hate it if you don't like spicy food. But, that's just the way it's gonna be. They bought two different varieties, a green and a red. I preferred the flavor of the green.   My favorite thing to order in a Mexican restaurant are taco salads. The only thing that I found a little disappointing was they didn't have any dressing for the salad. I prefer a little Italian dressing with mine, this is the first place I've been to that didn't have any dressing options. The salad was good, but not great.   The service was awesome. Everyone really seemed to be working as a team to pitch in and make sure we have everything we needed.

It's been a while since we've been here so when we came in Sunday for lunch our expectations were high since we've been craving it for so long.   It wasn't crazy busy which was nice, I hate waiting behind people.   The vegetables were fresh and well stocked. Instead of creating my own sauce I decided to just follow the board, I'm not good at direction but the Spicy Thai was wonderful. My biggest problem was the chicken, it tasted like jerky.   We'll be back but next time sticking to a vegetarian lunch!

We came in Friday night for dinner. There were two parties ahead of us so we passed the time by checking out the menu. Keep in mind, I hate seafood, I don't enjoy the taste, the smell, and I definitely don't like how sick it makes me. Being a Vietnamese restaurant, I knew my options were limited. I hinted to leaving but I lost that battle (thankfully).   We started off with Vegetarian Egg Rolls that were better than most places.   I had chicken Pho (7)  and my bf had a chicken dish (52)  My Pho was AMAZING. I was smiling the whole time and kept uttering, this is AMAZING. I wish he enjoyed his dish as much as I enjoyed mine.    While we were waiting another party politely asked how long it will be. He snapped and said "maybe 10 min, maybe 30, I don't know when people are leaving"  That was enough to make me want to get up and leave. I did not like how he talked to people. When he was seating us some lady gestured that she needed something and he rudely dismissed her.  Once we were seated all the staff was super friendly, but until you are actually at a table they can be quite rude.   5 for my food   2-3 for service

Uuuuaaaaaaaaaaahhhhggggggggllllaahhhh (that's my puking sound). While I didn't actually puke, I'm very surprised.   It was a typical Thursday night where neither of us (*cough* James *cough*) could make a decision on where we should eat. So while driving aimlessly down the road in every which direction, we pulled up Yelp and went to the closest Thai restaurant with solid reviews.   We sat down and both of our noses turned up wondering what that smell was. James proclaimed "it smells like a bathroom in here" I, however, couldn't smell what he was smelling....YET. All I could smell was cleaning products, like too many combinations of chemicals that make you wonder if someone is laying in the back passed out. I could smell bleach and something that smelled like a lavender scented ammonia.   I don't know why we stayed, maybe it was the hunger pains. Maybe it was laziness, but I regret that decision.   I ordered Hot and Sour soup and Egg Rolls.   The soup wasn't good, it was chicken broth with cayenne pepper dumped in. Some bland chicken and some uncooked mushrooms (straight from the package). James kept telling me to move my soup back because he thought it smelled like dirty feet, although I'm not sure how he could smell that over the bathroom stench.   The egg rolls were better but very greasy, I did like the inside however.   At some point in our meal, I finally got the whiff from the bathroom. OMG. I'm done eating, can we just go??  We thought it was a one time thing, maybe the line cook had some nasty Taco Bell for lunch, maybe their plunger broke, but after reading the reviews, this has been happening for months. Get a damn plumber out there or shut your doors.   NASTY!!

If you want store brand, cheap salsa to go along with the rest of your bland food, this is the place to go!  We live fairly close to this location and have heard mixed reviews, some have explained the horrible things it will do to your stomach while some have said it's the best in the valley.   We came in for dinner last weekend to give it a try. Boy were we disappointed...  First off, the salsa tastes good but if I wanted store bought salsa, I would stop at Fry's and pick some up on my way home. When I go out to eat at a Mexican restaurant I expect they aren't opening a jar of Pace and dumping it into a bowl.   I ordered the taco salad with shredded chicken. While there was a lot of chicken, I couldn't believe they used bagged lettuce with giant chunks of carrots and radishes. At no point does a taco salad recipe call for carrots or radishes. It was a cheap presentation on top of cheap ingredients.   I will say the guacamole was good, I'd love to know what store they buy it from so I can pick some up as well.    We have no desire to be back. If you want some good Mexican food try Don Ruben's on Cactus.

We came in to pick food up to-go this past Saturday for dinner. I ordered the Balsamic and Roasted Veggie Salad with chicken and NO roasted peppers and onions. But, when we got home I had to sit there and pick all the onions and peppers out. Now if they weren't roasted veggies it would have been easier and the flavor wouldn't have tainted my dinner.  I know she heard me because she repeated the order and emphasized NO peppers and onions, so this falls on the guy in the back cooking. There were ZERO guest in the restaurant when we came in, probably because it was storming really bad and it wasn't ideal weather to get out of the car.   IF, and that's a BIG IF I come back (my boyfriend lives a mile down the road so it's always on the list of possibilities) I would have to thoroughly check my food before leaving, something I shouldn't have to do.

They have turkey sausage.  I love turkey sausage.  I come here when I'm craving non-pork/beef breakfast meats.   I also come for the crepes.   And the pancakes.   And the omelets.   And the coffee.   Mmmm Coffee.   Service is decent too.

Being vegetarian Subway is always a great choice. Last week I came in and ordered a veggie sub and a cup on minestrone soup. However, when I got back to the office and had a spoonful of soup I quickly realzied it wasn't minestrone it was vegetable beef soup!! I can't eat beef and had that awkward moment where I needed to decide if I was going to swallow the soup or spit it out in front of my boss. Needless to say, I was not happy.  I took the soup back after work expecting an apology and my money back at the least. They explained to me they don't have a sign for vegetable beef soup and it's close enough. The apology I got was forced and meaningless.  They would not refund my money, they wouldn't give me a gift card for a future visit, they did nothing besides offer me a sandwich. No, I don't want a sandwich I would not be able to eat it before it went bad, I wanted my money back.   Needless to say after the way I was treated by the management staff I will avoid this location at all cost.

I never thought the day would roll around when I would give Discount Tire a negative review. I have always loved this company, they've never done me or my family wrong until now.   Not long after getting my last tire rotation my bf commented that I needed to get my tires rotated, I tried telling him I just got them done but the tires told a different story. Then my dad noticed that my tires need to be rotated ASAP. So I stopped in Wednesday night to get them done.   The guy walked out to my car to take a look and suggested it has been at least 11,000 miles, if not more since I've gotten them done, if ever. So, when we got to the computer and he looked up my information he noticed I had just gotten them done less than 5,000 miles ago. I  asked him to explain how it's possible there's more than a 3 mm difference between the front and the back if I had them rotated so recently. He tried blaming the weight of the vehicle and my driving habits, but we both know that wasn't the case. The bottom line is they DID NOT actually rotate my tires. I took my car to a different Discount Tire location the following morning in addition to another "unnamed" tire store to get their opinion, based on their comments. They all agreed something wasn't right, there is NO way my tires would have looked like that if they were just rotated.    Also, if you're going to complain about the customers after they call in with questions, do it quietly so other customers can't hear you. I know you think you're whispering, but you're not.

Horrible service. Disappointing food. Huge waste of almost 2 hours.   We stopped in this afternoon for lunch and to catch up with a buddy.  He arrived 10 min before us so I was quite surprised to see he didn't have a beer in front of him, we received our drinks and still he waited. It took OVER 20 MINUTES for him to get his Miller Light, there was no apology, no suggestion for a bottle or a different beer. We just sat there, being ignored.   It took forever for us to actually get her attention long enough to place our order as well.  The only good thing about our experience was the spinach and artichoke dip we had as an appetizer (it was actually really good, but not good enough to bump my review from 1 star).  My buddy, who was quite depressed about the NASCAR race being delayed obviously needed another beer to drown his redneck sorrows but despite telling our server, the beer never came so he went up to the bar and asked the bartender to pour him one. After she poured it, she went and pulled the tickets of all the drinks she needed to pour. There were five tickets, clearly standing there staring at her nails was more important.   Finally our food came but we still didn't have silverware, (despite wanting some when our appetizer arrived). Since it's a little difficult to eat a salad without a fork... I immediately asked for one (again) along with more water. Now you'd think grabbing silverware would be on the top of her priority list, nope...chatting (by chatting, I mean flirting with her obnoxious fake laugh) with another table was obviously more important. After sitting there patiently waiting for a while, my buddy got up in search of a fork. One of the other servers brought the silverware over but slammed them on the table with one hell of an attitude. At this point, I'm so over this restaurant.   Then I bit into my chicken. It's very possible it was cooked yesterday, left under the heat lamp for a day then cut into strips when my order came back. I've had jerky that's been easier to chew!!  Finally our server came over to ask how everything was...well I still don't have my water and my bf would like more coke, but I'm not holding my breath.   We spent the whole time waiting and waiting for our server to do her job. It was ridiculous, at one point we started timing her...8 minutes for a refill is completely unacceptable!!   She's lucky I wasn't the one paying, there's no way she would have received the 20% tip my bf felt obligated to leave. She didn't deserve it. She was horrible, incompetent and lazy!   I will NEVER be back, not just to this location but the tilted kilt in general.

Last week I received an alert a package had been delivered to my office, well after yelling at my mailman and checking the offices near mine, I gave up.   Then all of a sudden a Costco worker walked in my door with my package. I was both confused and overjoyed all at the same time.   (Costco is on Hayden, I'm on 84rd Way. I don't understand how they screwed this one up).   The employee who found my package had the following choices: Keep the package as his own  Give it back to USPS for redelivery  Look up my company's phone number and call to have someone come fetch the box.  Do the greatest thing ever and bring it to my office on his lunch break.   He chose the latter!!   It is little things like this that make Costco employees stand out from the rest. I was very grateful to receive this package, it contained much needed medication (I obviously use my office address for personal stuff).   Thank you again!

After 3 weeks my Galaxy S4 decided to stop charging.   I came in and was helped by David, after plugging it in and realizing it wasn't going to charge said we need to figure out if it's a battery issue or a problem with the charging port. He asked a co-worker Gina if he could borrow her battery for a minute so we could have a definitive answer. She said NO (in a really rude tone) and explained that I'll need to wipe my phone to see if it still doesn't work. I told her I needed to be able to make sure my G Cloud backed up my phone, plus wiping it with 6% battery life would cause the phone to shut off in the middle of it and brick my phone, a chance she thought I should take.  Well even if I could wipe it without bricking it, I'm not going to just wipe my phone if it's a battery issue. She said they don't have any batteries laying around, I said well he asked if we could use yours real quick and you said no, she then rolled her eyes and walked away. I asked her to come back so we could keep discussing this but she refused.   David apologized and said he shouldn't have put her on the spot like that.  He was just trying to think outside the box and come up with a quick solution to my phone not charging. So he went to talk to the manager to see if she had any ideas.   In the mean time I went over to the display phones, took the battery out and put it in my phone, plugged it in and got the answer we needed. It's the port, not the battery. I could hear the manager yelling at David...everyone could. He got yelled at for asking Gina to borrow her battery and for allowing me to take the battery out of a phone. He didn't tell me to do it, I did it all on my own since his co-workers and manager were completely worthless.   Since I purchased it at Costco ($70 cheaper plus awesome accessories) I had the option of having them send me a new one or just exchanging it at Costco. I obviously went that route.    I called Verizon Customer Service today about my incident last night and they took it very seriously. Especially since I had a billing error and the manager was supposed to correct it and she never did.    I highly commend David for doing whatever he could to help me.  Gina and the manager on duty were rude and absolutely worthless!!!

I've never seen it as busy as it was last night. 7:00 on a Sunday and it was packed, 30 min wait just for some lettuce wraps to-go.   We dine here about 3 times a month and *knock on wood* it's always been great. I've never had a bad meal, my order is always correct. I never get home and realize they forgot a sauce or gave me the wrong food. I'm impressed.

I never thought the day would roll around when my mom would stop telling me to sit up straight (even at 31 years old). It always hurt to sit without slouching, I always thought I was domed to look like a hunchback with a lot of back pain.  After a few visits with Dr. Steve, my posture has improved, I don't find myself cracking my neck and back all the time, I can sleep on my back whereas before I always lower back pain.   I would definitely recommend Dr. Steve to anyone who needs a top-notch chiropractor!

It's sad to see the menu prices consistantly increasing. At least have a lunch menu on the weekends too.   It's our favorite Thai place in The Valley, my boyfriend is obsessed with the Sweet and Sour Chicken, mainly for the cucumbers.   I've gotten something different every time and have never been disappointed.

This is by far our favorite location in The Valley. It's not congested like other locations, I don't have to fight for standing room in front of the soda machine, I don't have to pump elbows with someone getting a drink while I'm trying to fatten up with ice cream. I don't have to wait for some unsupervised kid to get soup while spilling it all over the place. The soup is it's own little island so you can get it from both sides, the bowls are spaced out in front of the soup for easy access.   It's laid out correctly and I wish the other ones would follow suite.   The staff is always nice. I get to seat myself rather than have someone put me at a table I don't want.    All around, we have no complaints about this location.   Two Thumbs Up!

This is our favorite breakfast joint.  They have the BEST pancakes in the valley.   We've only been in for breakfast since their dinner menu doesn't offer any vegetarian options besides getting a grilled cheese or asking for no meat on the salads. Adding a veggie burger would be inexpensive for the restaurant, can be tossed in the back of the freezer and be charged the same price as a beef burger.   This simple addition would allow us to come in for dinner all the time!

I've had a gift certificate burning a whole in my wallet for far too long.  Finally, the chance to use it!    Leah was our server and she was fantastic!   I started off with a glass of Colby Red Blend, while enjoying my glass I goggled the story behind the wine, it was created by a father whose son had undergone open heart surgery twice in order to raise money for The American Heart Association. Great wine with a great back story!   We split a salad and a pizza.   After drastically modifying the Waldorf Salad with the cheese and dressing on the side we quickly realized a whole salad is way too big for just the two of us (and we like to eat) with a Wild Mushroom Pizza. The salad and pizza were fantastic!   We will definitely be back!

We came in last night to watch the Tigers destroy the Red Sox which was great. We ordered a bunch of apps.  Regular wings - cooked nicely, not rubbery Boneless wings - very meaty, hated the Thai Peanut flavor which I expected to love Calamari - smelled HORRIBLE. Way too fishy smelling. I didn't eat any but the guys said it was OK. Edamame - it's hard to screw up edamame, it was great.   Our server was wonderful, she was attentive and brought us refills and extra plates with out having to ask.   It's close to the house and they have a great happy hour, half off all apps.   We'll be back!

Saturday night after a long day of being in the sun we ordered pizza, I had a quick errand to run so I chose pickup instead of delivery. I've never been to Barro's before and was just hoping it would taste better than Papa Johns and somewhat close to Spinato's because that's our go-to place in the area.   When I went to pick up the pizzas there was an issue but it was 100% my fault in my opinion, I didn't clarify my order when I placed it. The girl behind the counter politely disagreed, stated if the person who took the order had followed up with questions it would have been made correctly. I thought that was awesome and she even offered to remake them. No need, I have hungry folks at my house and need to get home. But, she did discount my pizzas to apologize for the error and I thought that was more than generous.   I also took a large salad to go. I LOVE THAT I CAN MAKE MY OWN SALAD. I like 5 pounds of mushrooms on a salad and I was able to do that. I would have been in a long time ago if I knew about this DIY side salad.   The customer service alone deserves 5 stars. I walked in the house and made the statement, even if the pizza is gross, I'm still going back!! But, it wasn't gross at all. It was fantastic!! If I had ordered it correctly it would have been a thin crust, so I can't be mad at all the extra dough. But, spot on.   I am certain the next time we need a pizza to do, we will be calling this place first. The prices are fair, the customer service is good and it's pretty darn tasty!!

Wow! Wow! Wow!  We came in Friday night on a whim and I now credit this as the best decision we have made in years! The restaurant was pretty full but there was a table for two available so we were seated immediately. Sandy was our server and at first she seemed kind of brash but after chatting with her a bit we quickly realized she must have lived in Jersey at some point. She was an absolute delight, she answered all the questions I had, and quickly brought me wine.   My favorite moment of the evening was when I heard her ask the chef if they were out of lemons, he said "No, why?" She responded by handing him the dish he just put in the window with the response "than take this back" I loved that she was so attentive of the food coming out of the kitchen and asked the chefs to make it right before bringing it to the guests. We joked that she was a female Gordon Ramsey.   I ordered the caprese salad and James ordered the margarita pizza knowing I wanted a slice but did not want meat on my pizza. The pizza came out first and after one bite I didn't even care about my salad that hadn't arrived yet, I was in Pizza Heaven. James had the analogy of it melting in your mouth like cotton candy. Sandy walked by and asked where my salad was, then immediately went to the chefs and requested it ASAP. I didn't even care at that point, I was half way in to my first slice and nothing else mattered.   I had 2 pieces of pizza and we shared the caprese. The only complaint about the salad is there wasn't an equal amount of mozzarella and tomato.   The next morning we regretted not taking a pizza to go so we could have left overs for breakfast.   We'll be back sooner than later and will be requesting Sandy!

I was devastated when the location on Raintree "located" to Camelback. Even though it seems sooo far to drive to this one it's worth my drive at least once a week for lunch. Especially on Wednesdays when it's $2.00 off.   They have everything you could ever want between the salad bars, hot bars and deli.

I was very impressed the service last night! The cashier was friendly, quick and welcoming.

The pickles are the best part!  Whether you get breakfast, lunch or dinner the food is always good and the service is decent.   I wish they had more non-breakfast vegetarian options besides vegetarian chili (it's not that great).

I brought my wedding dress here based on the reviews. Unfortunately, I did not have the same luck.  The dress was too large on me, especially in the chest area and it needed to be bustled.   I tried the dress on for Valentina and went over everything that needed to be done, she provided me a reasonable quote and I was to come back in two weeks for another fitting. When I came back, the dress was still too large on me, she suggested adding cups and taking more in off the sides. She also determined that the bustle was going to be more work that originally quoted and it would cost extra. ugh.   The next fitting, the top part was still too big and she accused me of losing weight. Yes, I lost a little weight but certainly not 2 inches around my bust, I can assure you of that.   When I came in for what was supposed to be my final fitting, the dress was all wrong, it puckered in places, I now had creases in my dress from it fitting improperly and the beading was no longer straight.   When I came back for my second final fitting, the zipper broke. I was actually relieved it broke there and not while walking up the isle. How it broke is beyond me though. I feel she should have checked the zipper.   So on my third final fitting, she helped me in and out of the dress and zipped it. I never took the time to look at the back of the dress closely, I didn't know I needed to. She offered me a small discount for the amount of times I've had to come in and I left with a dress that was not altered correctly, but at this point, there wasn't a lot I could do.   I took the dress to my mom's house so she could take it to my bridal suite for me. The next morning I sent some photos to a bridesmaid when I realized the buttons were missing from the back. There was originally a panel that hid the zipper and gave the illusion that it was button up. it was truly beautiful. So I called my mom crying and asked her to run it back over. Who also noticed the cup area was caved in and there was beading hanging from the dress.   For some reason I'll never understand, Valentina removed that whole panel. Which meant on one side I had beading up to the zipper and the other side, there was over an inch of no beading. She was able to do a makeshift panel that didn't fully cover the zipper, it was still visible, and sewed the buttons to the side. And, I was left with a chunk of dress with no beading so it looked like the dress had to be let out.   The back of the dress was destroyed. I am still furious. On my wedding day, I had to wear my veil for the whole evening just to hide the back of my dress.   I will NEVER bring anything here, I will continue to tell everyone I know how she ruined my wedding dress and how I am out a lot of time and money.   I can't clean and sell the dress because, who would buy a defective dress? I can't preserve it for my (future) daughter, because she deserves better! I would feel bad if someone bought it from goodwill.

Everything was fabulous!  Out waiter was wonderful from the second we walked in the door until he chased after us after we forgot something at the table. We were just going to check out the menu unitl he mentioned it was happy hour and we couldn't resist.   My boyfriend had sweet and sour chicken. He has a really hard time finding one he loves because of his obsession with cucumbers in it. We were super excited to see cucumbers listed in the ingredients. He ordered Medium since it was our first time and some places are hotter than others. It wasn't too hot by any means, easily could have ordered hot.   I wasn't super hungry so I just ordered edemame and spring rolls (and picked at his dinner) plus a glass of wine.   I definitely give this place 5 stars and can't wait to go back!!

I asked if I could wait inside instead of outside, they said not a problem but what they failed to mention is they will NOT let you know inside that your car is ready. I even mentioned to the cashier I was waiting inside to double check someone would let me know my car was ready. After waiting and waiting and waiting, I finally asked if it was ready and with a snippy tone I was told to go outside and check...  I drive an SUV (2013 Tucson) and had a large dog in the back, I specifically asked to make sure they were going do the "trunk area" since there was dog hair everywhere. They didn't.   There carpets were still dirty, there was white stuff on the seats that I could easiy remove by licking my finger and rubbing it. The steering wheel was greesy which is extremely dangerous. There are spots on the dashboard where they neglected to clean.   There was still dirt on the outside of my car, it looks like it was just hosed off, not actually washed.    All and all, 19.99 for a VIP wash is an extreme waste of money!!!

Ruby Tuesday used to be in our rotation but since we're never WOW'd it has been at least 6 months since we've been in for dinner.   We had a coupon for $15 off our meal, no restrictions so we happily came in for dinner. They recently (sometime in the past 6 months) got a new menu that was loaded with new options. I was sad to see my zucchini sliders disappear but half the time we were told they were out anyway. I kept things simple and just ordered the Veggie Trio which comes with three sides and the salad bar.   I don't remember what my bf ordered, he wasn't overly impressed, it was just OK.   We didn't leave hungry or unsatisfied. But, what really got us was the service. He was fantastic, I kept telling my bf that he could easily work in a fine dining restaurant, that's the type of service we received.   Service was a 5  Food was a 3.5

My favorite thing about this location is Stacy, she's always at the door to greet you and hold the door open on your way out. If she wasn't at the door I don't think there would ever be a straight line in that place. I love her friendly personality. She always asks how my weekend was or what's new.   The rest of the staff is hit or miss. Today I stood waiting for soup for a really long time while those making salads stood there chatting, I counted 6 folks not doing anything while I stood there waiting. Finally the cashier came over, apologized and scooped me some soup.  This happens often, no one is very attentive. The food is always consistent but service isn't.  I often get the Greek salad with no olives. So I tell the first guy no olives, then he hands the box with lettuce to the second person and says greek with no olives, she repeats "greek with no olives" then puts olives in the box. I then have to tell them I don't want olives and they always seem surprised despite the fact they repeated my order. This happens ALL THE TIME. It's similar to when I ask for soup to go and they ask if it's for here or to go, I tell them to-go and they put it in a regular bowl. There's not loud music. The staff just doesn't pay attention.

We placed an order for delivery last night online and not even 20 min later our doorbell was ringing. The pizza was piping hot, exactly how we ordered and very tasty!  Kudos!!

I came in with my mother on the 19th for a late dinner. She's never been to Paradise Bakery (I eat at the one in N. Scottsdale all the time) so I thought it would be a nice treat...it wasn't.   First off they rambled off a bunch of bread they didn't have which in turn meant a bunch of sandwiches they couldn't make. There really isn't a good excuse for running out of bread in a bakery, there just isn't. My mom picked a sandwich and asked for the mayo to be served on the side, simple request but she said they already premade all their sandwiches so it was take it or leave it. What? You premade all your sandwiches??? Gross  Moving on, mom picked a different sandwich, something with chicken that they could put on different bread. We both got some soup, a drink and those amazing carrot cake bites.   She opened her sandwich to take a peek and the chicken was pink. Not just a little undercooked but RAW. She took it right up to the counter and they made her a salad instead but it really grossed us both out. I will never eat chicken here and I highly doubt my mother will ever be back!!

The food was much better than expected, I'm a picky eater and when I asked them to change a dish completely they did so without a problem and it was amazing!  I hope this place is able to stay in business despite never having a packed restaurant.

We came in around 8:00 for dinner on a weeknight, the place was fairly dead.  I'm pretty sure my baked potato was cooked that morning, it was hard. My salad tasted like dirt.  My boyfriend's chicken was very thin and in-turn very dry. He did however love the baked beans which appeared to have pulled pork in it.

This is probably one of the best chinese buffets I've been to. They have a lot of options, the food is always hot and tastes good, plus it's not too expensive.  The only issues I have are the floors are always messy and it disgusts me when the servers sweep the floors, please start using a cordless vacuum!  The deserts are out of a box and aren't very impressive.   Also, It would be nice to see more non-meat entrees on the buffet.

We stopped in on the 1st to order a birthday cake for the 4th assuming that would be plenty of time. The girl working said it needed to be placed a week in advance, as we weighed our options on just picking up a pre-made cake or going somewhere else, she was calling her boss to see if they had time to do one more. And they did!   She was extremely friendly and helpful. Luckily it wasn't very busy in there since it takes quite a bit of time to order a cake.   We asked for Mint Chocolate Chip with purple and pink frosting, however it was very basic looking with sloppy writing. Nothing fancy, it was a little disappointing to give it to a 12 year old little girl.  But, it tasted great and we apprecaited them accomodating us with only 3 days notice.

Saying they have a great selection of beer, wine and liquor goes without saying. But, I like how I can usually stop any employee walking by and ask them a specific question about a wine or spirit and they know the answer. Friday night we stopped in to get a bottle of Rum and while we were standing there staring at a liquor we rarely drink a guy walked by asking if we were doing OK. We asked him about something specific and he actually knew what we were talking about! This happens more often than not, and if they don't know, they immediately find someone who does.   Their customer service is top-notch.

We had purchased a groupon a while back and realized it was about to expire so we'd come in for dinner. We weren't expecting much since we're always seeing billboards for $5.99 pasta on Monday's and Tuesday's. How great can a place be if they sell pasta for that price?  Well, it was amazing!!  We both ordered off the chalkboard menu, my bf got the chicken and I had the portabella mushroom. Between my margaritta, the bread, our salads and a decent size portion of dinner, I had left overs. He doesn't normally have a hard time deciding what to get but he kept flipping back and forth since there are soooo many good options.   I'm hoping they run another groupon soon, we're coming back regardless but it would be nice to save a few dollars =)

I purchased a booklet for $50 the allowed me to come in for multiple visits only needing to pay at least the predetermined tip amount, since I work in the area and I'm always looking for a new, amazing salon this seemed like an awesome deal.  I came in a few months ago for the first visit which was a deep conditioning treatment, cut and style.  First off, it was a basic wash, they used their normal conditioner, just rubbed it in and rinsed it out. Nothing deep conditioning about it.  My hair cut was horrible, I had to go elsewhere and get it fixed. It was uneven and I had random chunks of hair that were longer in certain spots, the left side didn't match the right.  If it wasn't bad enough he gave me a horrible hair cut, his attitude and personality left a lot to be desired. He was very self-absorbed, kept playing with his hair in the mirror instead of focusing on mine.   So needless to say I wasn't in a huge hurry to get back to this place, but my vouchers were about to expire so I called to make two different appointments. One for a mani/pedi but they explained they do not have a nail tech at this time and I'll have to call back in a couple weeks to schedule. Ugh  The other appointment was for highlights and another deep conditioning treatment (that doesn't actually exist). I asked the girl if she could see who I had my appointment with last time, she could and I explained in detail that I did not care who my appointment was with as long as it wasn't the same person as last time. She apologized my first appointment was a disappointment and said she'll be happy to schedule me with someone else. There was no room for confusion.  So I left work early yesterday for my appointment, I checked in and waited and waited.  Finally the one darn person I requested not to touch my hair walks up and calls me by name. WTF. You have got to be kidding me???   Beyond irritated I have a seat in his chair figuring I'm just going to let him do the highlights bit will not let him cut it. First off he had no idea what my appointment was, he seemed confused when I told him. He asked what color I wanted, I told him I thought we could figure it out together with his color samples. All he needed to do was put the samples by my hair to see what look the best. Instead he huffs and puffs and asks why I didn't bring pictures with me then storms off to get some magazines. Ummmm, What??  That was my cue to get up and leave. I told the girls at the desk about my issue with them scheduling me with the one person I requested to not have. They didn't seem to care, just an "oh, that's weird" instead of apologizing    I'm beyond irritated with this place! Problem is I already "paid" for these services. I'd rather just have my money back for my voucher!!!

This is a follow-up review to my original one star review. As you can see my rating hasn't change, I was really hoping it would. But, unfortunately I cannot in good faith increase my star rating or delete my review after the irate conversation with the owner Lindsay Smith.   As you read in my original review, after purchasing a booklet of deals I had a horrible experience. When I tried coming in for my second appointment, I was disappointed once again. Now, you could very easily ask why I would ever make a third appointment, well that's simple, my services were already paid for and after complaining three times (on the phone, via Facebook and in person) I was assured I would not have the same stylist as my first two visits. I understand that just because the salon hired one guy who can't cut hair and is extremely rude, that doesn't mean the rest of the staff is that way. So, I scheduled an appointment for Saturday, Feb 1st.    On the Thursday prior I received a call from the owner asking me why I scheduled an appointment after leaving a one-star review (2 weeks prior). I explained that I had essentially already "pre-paid" for my services and that I was going into my appointment with an open mind. I was hoping I would leave with fantastic hair and would then be more than happy to rewrite my review. Lindsey didn't see it that way. She made it very clear she wanted that review removed, claiming it was "unfair" for her. I told her I could not just remove my review because she asked me to, that I would be happy to change it after my appointment or if she made things right and just refunded what I paid for my booklet. She explained she was canceling my appointment, that she did not want me in my salon simply because I gave her a negative review and said she would contact the third party I purchased my booklet from for a refund.   Lindsay called me again that night to remind me I no longer had an appointment (I heard you the first time) and that she spoke with the third party and I would NOT be getting a refund. She insisted I remove my review since in her opinion it was slander, claimed she had already talked to her attorney about this. Well guess what, you can't bully someone into removing a review you don't like!!! She repeatedly blamed me for being in this situation, saying I should have contacted her. However, I informed her salon of my problem on 3 separate occasions, it is NOT my fault if your staff does not inform you there was a problem and you have a client that's extremely upset. The fault lies with your staff not informing a manager like they stated they would, it lies with your stylist whom I wouldn't let groom a homeless dog and you for having NO clue how to run a business. Based on the filtered 1-star reviews I'm not the first to be dissatisfied and unfortunately I will likely not be the last.   To cancel my appointment simply because you do not like my review is not very professional (or mature), a real business owner would have wanted me to come back in to show me that her company is better than this. Instead, (to no surprise) she threw a fit and hung up on me when I refused to delete my review. Very unprofessional!!   In the end, I never got my money back. She claims that the $50 I spent on the booklet was less expensive than a $65 hair cut there, which would make sense if I had actually left with a decent haircut and didn't have to go elsewhere for it to be fixed.   Additionally, they are advertising services they do not have. The booklet included services for a manicure and a pedicure but for months I have been unable to schedule one because they cannot seem to keep a nail tech on staff...I wonder why??  One more thing, please read the previous 5 star reviews. Some are employees (they said so in their review) and others are clearly either friends of the salon or work there themselves. There are too many reviews where this is their only review. They don't have a yelp photo, didn't complete their profile, don't have any friends and this is their only review. Seems mighty suspicious to me. But, if that's how Lindsey feels she needs to portray her business, she's only hurting herself.

Came in Tuesday to watch some baseball. Our server was really friendly and helpful, I heard him mention he used to be a cook. Most cooks I've experienced aren't front of the house material, but he was great!  We had some half priced apps. The tortilla chips claim to be homemade but they tasted stale from a bag with cheap spinach and artichoke dip. The mushrooms were great and my salad was just as I expected.   Depending what's on TV, I might be back but I wouldn't go out of my way.

Since my mom and I are going on a cruise in 18 DAYS I wanted her to get a little base tan because I'm not about to rub aloe on her back for a week in the Caribbean.   While this wasn't the closest tanning salon to her house, it did have a great deal with no contract. Well what their website doesn't tell you is they are skating a very thin line on the word contract. Granted they aren't forcing you to commit to any certain time you'll be tanning here, they do FORCE you to do auto-draft. When she gave my dad the price, he opened his wallet to pull out the cash. She said that they can not accept cash (WHAT???) and that he had to use a credit/debit card. But, why? You claim you don't do contracts and someone can purchase just one month. She said they could just cancel at the end of the one month. Why should he give you his credit card number, sign up for auto-draft for something we only want for 2.5 weeks?   So we left.   They could have made their $25 for my mom's handful of tans, made money on some tanning lotion, maybe even some new goggles if they had ones better than hers, but instead are stuck with yet another 1 star review on yelp.   Any place that does not let you pay cash for a service and requires you to give them your credit card information is likely a place that will "accidentally" not cancel your auto draft and continue to charge you time and time again. We weren't going to take that chance.   Additionally, their website offers 5 tans for $5. What they don't mention is it's 5 days in a row and if by chance there's a holiday in the middle of the 5 days and they're closed, you only get 4 days.

I work in the Scottsdale Airpark area and often I am going door to door giving everyone else their mail and they are often coming into my office to bring me mine.   It's getting out of control.   Monday, I received notification my package was delivered, I was confused since I assumed it was too big for my mailbox so I went to check there and the other offices near me. But, it wasn't anywhere to be found.   So Tuesday I patiently waited for my guy to drive by so I could go ask him where it was. His response was "I don't know I was off yesterday". Well that's not very helpful since the box contains medicine I spent over $100 on and I didn't have the option for insurance.  Later that day some guy walked in with my box. I was overjoyed to say the least. When I asked him where my package got delivered, he said Costco. Seriously? Costco?!?!   Good thing it wasn't delivered to Sam's Club or I never would have gotten my package.   Kudos to the Costco worker who came all the way over to my office on his lunch break to bring it to me. Booooo to the USPS carriers who ONCE AGAIN screwed up.   You guys are getting out of hand.

DO NOT GET YOUR HAIR DONE BY ANDREA!  My mother made an appointment to come here on the 15th and had problems from the get-go. I called my mom when she was signing in to tell her about a special they were running and the stylist was so rude to my mom when she asked about it, I told my mom to just walk out and not even get her hair done. If I can hear how rude you are through the phone and not even be forced to see the snotty faces you're making then you certainly don't need to be in a customer service position. To my mother's regret she stayed.   I called my mother a couple hours later to see how her cut and color went and she was crying. This "self-taught stylist" turned her hair ORANGE, cut it crooked, used a razor on her fine hair and in other words, DESTROYED HER HAIR. Not only did she destroy her hair but apparently her shift was up and she decided it was time to leave before my mom even had time to come to grips with what she had done.   I told my mom it couldn't be as bad as she thought. Sadly, it was worse than she described.   The following day she had an appointment with Lauran, the salon manager to try and get it fixed and I went with her.   WOW, Lauren is a miracle worker, after multiple cycles of chemicals and washings the orange was for the most part gone and the cut was...better. The problem with a bad hair cut is there's only so much you can do. Not only did Lauren do a great job with her hair but she was a lovely person as well. Very friendly and VERY patient while my mom kept describing how horrible of an experience she had with Andrea.   I wouldn't let Andrea ever touch my hair and if you don't want to look ridiculous, you shouldn't either.   Lauren, however, was AWESOME!!

We came in on Saturday 12/14/13 and had the most amazing customer service experience. As soon as we walked in the girl asked if we were looking for anything in particular, she chatted with us about what we were buying, knew prices of stuff without even having to look and made our whole trip to Hi-Health, easy and fun.   I know how boring it can get working retail on a Saturday night and while I'm sure there are a million other places she'd rather be, she looked like she truly enjoyed her job.

It's been a while since I've been to an Einstein's but I woke up Saturday morning with a craving that couldn't have been satisfied anywhere else.  I ordered the Asparagus, Mushroom & Swiss on a thin everything bagel. When I ordered it, the cashier said "is that the one with...." heck if I know, I just know it was good last time and that's what I want. I was taken aback a little by her question. But, she was friendly, just possibly new.   Our food came out really fast and it was everything we hoped for and more. It was like a scavenger hunt to find a table that wasn't dirty though. I would like to see them actually wipe down tables. It wasn't busy (we slept in).

I can only rate their Thai lunch to go.   We've picked up lunch from here half a dozen times and it's always spot on. I've requested substitutions, always called during their lunch rush and ordered at least two different entrees.   The spiciness level is accurate, the vegetables are cooked perfectly, there is always a large portion of food and it's always tasty.  They do the little things that makes a difference like taping down the lid to my soup so it doesn't end up all over my car and having it ready every time I show up.   This will continue to be a staple for our lunch time cravings.

The food is always consistent but getting them to answer their phone to place a to-go order is a nightmare! On multiple occasions we've ended up placing an order elsewhere since they either don't answer or they put you on hold and never come back.

For a while Ocean Blue had groupons all the time so for a few weeks we would come in and get yogurt, we're now addicted. I often hear "let's go get blue" which is code for grab your shoes we're getting yogurt!  I love that they have yogurt made with stevia, although not often enough (I did not like the coffee flavored one fyi).  I love the fresh fruit and if that went away I probably would too.  I love that I'm able to try all the flavors before making a decision although I never have to think twice when they have cake batter. All in all the service is always good. They're really just bored teenagers wishing they weren't working on a Friday night.   My only complaint is the soda machine is always broken. Please fix that!

Best Chicken Wontons EVER!! We stopped in on a whim last weekend. It was raining and we were hungry.   We weren't sure at first if we are to just have a seat, go to the counter to order or just stand by the door and wait. (You just seat yourself).   We started off with chicken wontons which were fan-freaking-tastic. I wish there was more of a "filling" though.   We both ordered the garlic chicken extra spicy...wow, spicy indeed. Often times we'll ask for something hot or thai hot and it's medium at best. But, they weren't messing around. I would suggest ordering medium and going from there if you don't want it over the top hot. It was served with rice and cucumbers/tomatoes on the side. I loved the side of raw veggies.   This was the best Asian food I've had in quite sometime and we'll definitely be back.

My dad took my mom to the ER and was admitted last week  which is scary in itself. Luckily everything turned out great and she's "fit as a fiddle" as she keeps telling people.  Although, we certainly didn't know that when she arrived but every nurse, doctor, lab guy along the way treated my mom like she was the only patient in the building and treated her like she was part of their family.  I could not have asked for a better staff to entrust with my mom!  No one likes going to the hospital, but the next time I need one, I might consider the extra drive getting to Boswell based on how my mom was treated!

We came in Saturday night for a friend's birthday and it was great! The food was wonderful, our server was extremely upbeat with a great personality, our chef was funny and great at what he did.  They accidentally served our soup and salads to the table next to us so we had to wait longer than normal, but it wasn't a big deal. We probably wouldn't haven't noticed if they hadn't of said anything.   We'll definitely go back!

I always get naked veggie dogs with lots of saurkraut, gouda, banana peppers, tomatoes and mustard! It's amazing.   If you haven't had their fried pickels, it's a MUST!   I work in North Scottsdale so I get very excited when they will be in the Whole Foods parking lot, however I only made the mistake of going at noon once. I spent almost an hour in line, but it was sooo worth it.

Don't pass this restaurant by like we did so many times. Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place. Great food, good service and friendly on the wallet!!  We've been twice and plan on going many more times.   The only complaint I had was on our first visit I asked if I could SUBSTITUTE the meat for hashbrowns. She said "sure, not a problem" but when the bill came I was still charged for a side of hashbrowns. The point was to substitute not to have them hold on to the bacon and charge me extra.   It woudl be nice not to have to choose between pancakes and hashbrowns when ordering an omlet. 2 pancakes and a small side of hashbrowns would be a much better idea than getting 4 pancakes OR hashbrowns.

We had a horrible experience a couple months ago and decided to give it one more shot this morning, it didn't pay off. Unfortunately we have ate here for the final time. Every time the food and service have gotten worse and worse.   We waited over 10 min to be asked what we wanted to drink, our food came fast but my boyfriend's omlet looked like it was only made with two eggs, not the three eggs they claimed. It was very tiny and the only thing on the extra large plate (the pancakes were served separately).   My omlet was equally as small and I was disgusted by the fact the mushrooms were from a can!! They never brought my toast, I would have asked for it had the server have came and asked how our food was prior grabbing our plates and dropping off the check.   I wish I could say this was a fluke but it's happened multiple times. If you want a great breakfast place, go to Black Bear Diner, you will NOT be let down like you would be here!

I will never understand why it's so difficult to slap some cream cheese on a bagel. But, consistently they screw up my order. I'm not talking about once in a while, I'm talking almost every single time.  Every time I ask for a specific bagel toasted very very dark with a specific type of cream cheese and as I sit here writing this I'm staring at a bagel not toasted with plain cream cheese. I really hate plain cream cheese and I can't stand a non-toasted cold bagel. Keep in mind the receipt taped to the bag has the order right.   I decided this morning I am done with this location. I'll head over to Big City Bagels, even though I'll have to get out of my car, it'll be worth it. My order will be correct and I won't have to literally throw my money in the garbage can.

I work nearby so when I'm in the mood for a bagel and an iced tea, I pull into this Dunkin location, but time after time my order was wrong. Every time, I'd ask myself the same question, "WHHHHYYYY DO YOU KEEP COMING HERE".   I've brought my issues to the attention of the manager who was always super friendly and you could tell he didn't stand behind his incompetent workers (my words, not his).  So I stopped coming. I've only been here 3 times in the past few months and I'm happy to say, I haven't had one single order wrong. I think 3 times in a row is enough to change my review and admit maybe they got their ducks in a row now.   Kudos to you for making some positive changes, maybe I'll stop in for some Iced Tea (and a bagel) a little more often now.

55 minutes.  FIFTY FIVE MINUTES.   That's how long it took to get one sandwich delivered.   I called at 46 minutes to inquire how much longer, I work less than a mile from their store. It shouldn't take long to get here. He said the driver has already left with my sub but offered no apology for me having to wait so long.   If I'm getting food delivered it's because I don't have time to pick it up. If I don't have time to leave my office, I probably don't have time to wait ALMOST AN HOUR to get my food.   The arrogant kid just tossed it on my desk with an attitude. You're lucky I already included my tip.  And, once again the bag is filled with pickle juice and my food was darn near falling out of the bag.  WHYYYYYYY IS THIS SO HARD FOR YOU??    Here's the main reason I'll NEVER eat at Jimmy John's again.... http://www.bilerico.com/2012/05/more_than_one_reason_not_to_eat_at_jimmy_johns.php

I wish this wasn't the closest Chipotle to my house. Their biggest problem here is inconsistency. The portions are never the same, you have to keep repeating yourself.  Sometimes they give you a good scoop of rice, other times you can still clearly see the bottom of the bowl.   I always get a vegetarian salad, with the vegetarian options Guacamole is included. Countless times when I say I want guac they tell me it's $1.80. Instead of correcting I just say OK with the hopes the cashier is smarter than the salsa girl.   Countless times there hasn't been any hot sauces put out. None by the soda machine, none on any of the tables.   We try to avoid this location at all costs, unfortunately it's the closest one to home. I just wish they would train their staff better and be more consistent.

I hate this location!  My boyfriend picked up food to-go Wednesday night and for the SECOND time liquid soaked through the bowl and through the bag! This does NOT happen at other locations. There was so much liquid at the bottom of my bowl it looked like soup.

The Sweet Potato Tortelli is AMAZING!!   Dining out as a vegetarian can be tricky if you want something besides a salad. I love that they have a meatless entree, especially one as delicious as this. Kudos to the chef!!  My boyfriend had the Prime Rib (it was a little over cooked) and we shared the Salted Caramel Pudding for desert, it was yummy!!

It's not often I venture away from my desk for lunch during the week without having to bring it back and eat all alone. So I was quite excited to actually get a lunch break... Since other Yelpers keep checking in here, I thought I'd give it a shot.   The place is nothing spectacular to look, but the service was great and the food was good.   What I was in the mood for, wasn't on the menu so in a hurry I just spit out "General Tso's Chicken Please". After we ordered and paid I walked away wondering how they will get the food to me since I didn't give them a name and they didn't give me an order number. Oh well, they'll find us....I hope.   We took a seat outside and waited about 5 minutes before some lady brought our food right to us with wonton chips for FREE.   For $12 (no drinks) for two, I was happy.  I'm not in a hurry to get back here but they met all my expectations and I'll add it to my list of places to eat when I'm craving Asian food in North Scottsdale.

I understand leaving a note in my box telling me I have a package if it's something I need to sign for. But, when no signature is required why can't my package be left in one of the lockers and a key left in my box? I don't receive packages very often and when I do, they never need to be signed for. A couple times in the past few years they've put the package in the locker but the rest of the time I have to ask for it. It wouldn't be a big deal if their hours weren't horrible and the customer service was even worse.  Ya stand at the counter FOREVER waiting for someone to come help you and when they do, they take FOREVER to find your package.  I asked a few weeks ago why they couldn't have left it in the locker considering my package arrived on a Tuesday and I wasn't able to get there during business hours until Saturday. She said it's a hassle to walk around and put the packages in the lockers.  Well it's a bigger pain in the butt to spend over 30 min waiting at the counter and then waiting for a package. Yes, I said over 30 min! But, I appreciated her honesty.  The folks who work here are rude, condescending and lazy. I often do my business at the location in North Scottsdale and those folks are wonderful. Why are you so angry? You get to leave work at 4:30 every day!!!

Last night my dad had an epiphany...he purchased Groupons for AZ YO CO that are about to expire!! Ahhhhhhhh. So after our family dinner, we hopped in the car and headed to get frozen yogurt.  There weren't any other customers in the store when we walked in, but it was pretty late on a Sunday night. First thing I noticed was the lack of frozen yogurt options. They had a lot of machines but not a lot of flavors. So I looked around for the sample cups and to my disappointment I quickly realized this is one of those places that gets your samples for you. I HATE THAT!!! We will drive out of our way to avoid places like this. I don't know why it irritates me sooooo much, maybe it has something to do with the fact I'm a big girl, I can get my own sample of yogurt without making a mess. Careless folks ruin it for everyone I guess.   The yogurt wasn't good. It was very soft, borderline runny.   The toppings were lacking. If I wanted tons of candy, I would have been all set. But, since I wanted fruit, my options were limited. I could have strawberries, but they weren't fresh strawberries, it was like a chunky syrup. I could have cherries but I'd have to pick off all the stems, I could have pineapple...but I don't want pineapple, that sounds horrible on my half peanut butter, half cake batter yogurt.   So despite my dad telling me I needed to get $6 worth, I just couldn't.    I'm glad this place isn't by my house since I have no desire to come back. But, it is by my parent's house...guess I should check yelp for better options for them.

We met up with a buddy of ours this past weekend for some wings and beer. First off, the server we started with wasn't the server we finished with, she got busy and apparently handed off some of her tables.   We started off with potato skins and a half order of nachos. The menu states it comes with your choice of meat but our server never asked us what type of meat. It all happened so fast that we didn't really get a chance to specify. Of course the nachos came out without any meat, I'm assuming when he puts the order in he's prompted to choose the meat and he decided to just put no-meat instead of coming to ask us. When the nachos came, I asked about it and he said in an accusatory tone "you didn't specify". I didn't like him, he had an attitude the whole time.   The music playing when we got there was great, a little old school alternative. But, in the middle of our meal they changed it to rap music, very-very loud rap music. While I do listen to that music, it has a time and a place. Mid-afternoon in a sports bar is not the place.   Between the service and the unenjoyably atmosphere, we will not be back.

PORK SOAKED VEGETABLES!  Now, I'm sure I know what you're thinking, don't eat at a steak house if you're vegetarian but I've done it many times over the years and been completely satisfied since other restaurants are honest about what's in their food. This joint has an item on the menu for vegetarians to pick 4 sides to create a meal, what they fail to mention is all their sides contain animal products.    They cook their baked and sweet potatoes in bacon fat, their mashed potatoes and rice contain chicken broth, even their green beans have pieces of pork in them.  To offer a entrée of four side dishes for non-meat eaters is an awesome thing for a steakhouse to do, but to have all those sides contain meat is disgusting. If I hadn't inquired about the potatoes I would have never known until I was throwing up that evening from eating hidden meat products.   The ONLY reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because they were accommodating enough to microwave a potato for me. I ordered the salad without animal (wasn't washed), I asked for steamed veggies (raw) and fries (horrible choice but what can ya do?)   My boyfriend's steak was supposed to be medium rare, it was well done and no thicker than your finger. The 11 year old with us ordered medium well, hers was borderline raw.    Even the meat eaters in our group were unsatisfied. We will never be back!!!

I hate to admit that I come here often but it's soooo close to work and I find their onion rings  irresistible despite the fact I don't care much for onions. If I'm getting fast food, chances are I'm not getting out of my car - this place is no exception, so I can't say much about the cleanliness of the restaurant or bathrooms.   There is one lady who is ALWAYS working, it never fails. She is awesome, always smiling, super friendly and never forgets to hook me up with ketchup and anything else I may require.  My order is always the way I ordered it, hot and quick.

If you're going to use your Groupon for a movie and a soda for $6 it's a great deal. If you don't make it in and the Groupon expires...you're screwed because SMG violates Groupon's policy.   It clearly states it can be used towards any goods or services after the promotional value has expired, if you contact Groupon they will tell you the exact same thing. If SMG refuses to accept your expired voucher for ANY GOODS OR SERVICES, contact Groupon and they will refund your money.

I'm not an antique person, but my boyfriend is so we often go Mantiquing, looking for manly things.   We stopped in here on a whim and was pretty impressed with all the neat stuff. Even for someone who doesn't care for old things, I really had a good time browsing around. We didn't buy anything, but maybe on our next trip since I have agreed I will come back.

Not worth it!  I wasn't expecting to have to fork over so much cash. Luckily we had half priced tickets. If we ended up paying the full $12 just to get in the doors then pay an outrageous amount at each of the vendors, I would have been even more upset.   The only plus was, I had some amazing tacos. But, that's it. We will definitely not be going next year.

This review is for the car wash: WOW! They did a wonderful job, I had spilled something on my passenger's seat and asked if they would be able to get it clean as well even though that's not part of the interior/exterior wash and they did. They could have pushed a detail package on me which I wouldn't have purchased but instead they went above and beyond and because of that I will definitely be back.

I hate to write this review since I've been super impressed in the past. But, it needs to be said.   I came in for a car wash and a quick lunch on April 3rd. It was slightly after noon so I knew the line to get lunch was going to be extra long. Even though I had plenty of time to stand in line and eat, I decided to just grab a turkey wrap from the cashier. The tortilla portion of my wrap was hard around the edges, so I ended up just dipping the turkey meat into some mustard, disappointed.   When my car was finally ready, (almost 20 min after the estimated time), I naturally handed the guy a large tip when he handed over my keys. Note to self: don't tip until you see if the job was performed well. I hopped in and drove away, it didn't take long for me to realize my car was still dirty. I lifted the floor mats and there was still sand/dirt/random stuff under the mats. The backseat had white all over it from the polishing cream and there was still dust all over my dash.  If I wanted a sloppy job done, I would have cleaned my car myself. But, I came to professionals to have it done correctly.   The only good thing was the outside of my car looked great. But, any $3 car wash could pull that off, my car wasn't that dirty on the outside to begin with.   Based on this experience, I will not be back. Nor can I continue to recommend this place to friends. What a shame.

I'm not exactly what you'd call motivated when it comes to cleaning my own car. I'd rather pay someone to wash and vacuum it while I sit back and read a magazine. So places like this are right up my alley. My last visit was unfortunate, I left unimpressed and decided I wouldn't be back. But, since my car needed some TLC, I was torn on where to go.  Michael, the general manager had contacted me on Yelp asking for a second chance, although, I usually don't jump at second chances, even if they're free. My Yelp reviews can't be bought. I don't care how much free food and service you throw at me, if it's not good, I'm not going to say it is.  I decided I'd take Michael up on his deal because it's one of the few places I wanted to give a second chance to and boy am I glad we did.  We came in Saturday for an interior and exterior wash. I dropped my car off and let the cashier know I was looking for Michael. He promptly greeted us, apologized for my previous visit and assured me this time would be different. He told us to order breakfast or lunch and it would be on him.  I ordered the breakfast tacos with chicken, it's not on the menu but since I don't eat the suggested meat options, I went rogue. OH. MY. GOD. Those were the best tacos I've ever had in my life. At this point, I didn't care if my car looked like they went off-roading instead of cleaning it. I was hooked.  Michael stopped by to check on our breakfast and suggested we grab some sauces. It's very rare I don't douse whatever I'm eating in sauce, but there was NO need for any flavor, I actually thought it might ruin my breakfast. On my second taco I did try some of the salsa that came with my breakfast and it was fantastic.  My fiancé ordered pulled pork and eggs. I didn't pay much attention to what he was eating since I dove into those tacos like a fat kid who hadn't ate in a week (it wasn't a pretty sight). But, he definitely made a point to say he would order that same breakfast again in a heartbeat.  When our plates were empty, Michael stopped back by to offer us desert. There is no way I'm fitting anything else inside of my belly. But, sure why not? So he brought us a banana cupcake that was to-die-for. I knew we were receiving "special treatment" but he went above and beyond. While we were eating our cupcake, I noticed he took another table one to try on the house. He wasn't just treating us like royalty, he was treating others that way too.  Michael went above and beyond to make sure we were pleased.  Now it was time for the car reveal, it was spotless, my car looked brand new all over again. It would have been nice if they had vacuumed out the random cookie crumbs from the cup holder, but overall, the job they did was just like my first few visits. I was impressed.   Needless to say, we will be back. Even if it's not to get my car washed, just for those tacos.

We came in for date night last Friday night and sat at the bar. We were greeted quickly by the bartender who was eager to tell us about their Sauv Blanc options by the bottle. He was knowledgeable and super friendly.   We ordered a bottle and shared bruchetta. We both ordered the classic with tomatoes, mozzerella and basil. My date ordered one with salmon, i don't know what it was but he loved it and I ordered the warm artichoke. Mine was fantastic, it tasted better than I had expected from the description.   The whole time we sat there our wine glass was never empty (until the bottle was gone), rather it was the bartender who waited on us or a passer by in the bar area, someone was always topping it off.   We will defintely be back again...hopefully soon!

I love this little car wash. It's right on my way home from work, the vacuums are free and the $3 car wash is usually suffice to get my car clean. My biggest complaint is you have to ask for a towel to clean off your dashboard and other places you may have spilled something and they're always dry. I expect them to be damp.   I do have a few tips for all the customers.  1. There are lots of bays to clean out your car, unless they are extremely busy and more than half are full, there is no reason you need to park next to me when the next 5 spots are free. It's kind of crappy when I can't open my passenger's side door because you are parked next to me with your door open.   2. Turn your stupid music down. Blaring heavy metal in your old Chevy Cavalier does NOT make you cool.   3. The automatied machine is not that hard. You select your wash and pay. It should not take more than a minute. PS the $3 wash is in the lower right hand side.

This was very possibly the WORST dining experience I have ever had. Like everyone else we bought the groupon thinking we struck gold with a $10 buffet for two. Especially Mediterranean which normally has a great selection of vegetarian food for me and lots of meat for my boyfriend.   We walked in and could instantly hear construction on the other side which was a huge turn off and it's not that the decor was tacky but it was unfinished and had that gross feeling of not wanting to touch anything. I don't know why they thought this was the perfect time to trick everyone into dining here with a groupon when they were still trying to get the place together. At least take down the Fuji Buffet signs!!  The girl who greeted us immediately stated they were having plumbing propblems and did not have fountain water and asked if bottled water was ok and that it would be no extra charge. I'm still a little confused how they were able to have fountain soda if they were having plumbing problems and unable to serve water.   From a distance you'd think "wow, they have a great selection of food" but then you get closer and quickly realize it's far from impressive. Since it's a buffet and of course I wanted to get my money's worth, I filled up my plate but low and behold EVERYTHING was cold. I don't mean a couple things weren't as hot as they should be but actually cold.   They brought pita bread that was burnt and left an awful taste in my mouth. Knowing there was nothing on the buffet I could eat I settled for watermelon which was not fresh, it was definitely last weeks produce.   The owner gave me snide looks when she cleared our plates, I actually regret not explaining to her why I couldn't eat anything on my plate. But, honestly how could she not know?   When the girl came back over we asked if we could just get our check for the coke he ordered, she went and asked and was told $4.00. Seriously??? You're charging me $2.00 for a 35 cent bottle of water that I had to drink because you had plumbing problems and couldn't give me tap water? I'm not trying to be cheap but I don't drink soda.   We gave her exactly $4.00 and she handed it to the owner who again gave me dirty looks. I still left a tip but only because I'm a former server and not to commend a job well done.  I plan on contacting the health department today to inform them of this place serving food that's not at the right temperature. I can only imagine what's really going on in that kitchen!!!  My advice to everyone is to not walk foot in here. If you bought a groupon, just chalk it up to $10 down the drain and don't even bother!!

We stopped in here with some friends after having dinner at Hula's Friday night. They have a great selection of froyo, lots of toppings to go on top of my CAKE BATTER and they're not one of those snooty places that gets the sample for you. I really hate that, I'm old enough to get a sample of froyo without making a mess everywhere!  The guy working was friendly, the place was clean and there was ample seating. Plus, I really dig the little TV in the corner.

I get take out from here 2-3 times a month and it's always right. I've never had a problem.   Today was the first time I placed the order in store, usually it's done online. I expected a horrible wait but I was in and out in 10 min with my lunch.    Awesome food and awesome service!

I've never been here before but my boyfriend sold me on this place with " it's similar to Chipotle but with tortilla soup". I'm not one to ever turn down tortilla soup so I was game! Besides the soup I also ordered a kid's quesadilla.  All seemed to be right in the world until I had a spoonful of soup and it was ICE COLD.  Do you know how long you need to keep a vat of hot soup off of a heat source for it to get cold? A really long time! Which tells me NO ONE was checking the temperatures of the food and no one bothered to notice the heat source wasn't on.  So after my first bite of cold soup, I took it up to the cashier and I got a deer in the headlights look. Like they were confused about needing to fix my problem.  I was asked if I wanted them to warm it up. Seriously? NO. Do you know what that's going to do to my avocado?  So they offered to make me a new one from scratch. I sat down and ate my kids quesadilla and my boyfriend wolfed down his burrito. Then I was done and bored and still hungry and I didn't have any soup.  So I went and asked for a refund. They assured me it would only be a few more minutes. At this point I had waited almost 10 min for new soup. No thank you.   What could have been a Rock My Socks sort of experience turned into me vowing to never come back here again. The food wasn't edible, the customer service was horrible and I can't trust a place that does not check the temperatures of their food since I have no desire to get food poisoning,

We came in Sunday to watch football, this was my first time at this location. Luckily my game was on the big screen in the bar and the guy who was changing channels put the other game I wanted to watch on the next biggest TV for me.  So far we're off to a good start.   We had Alexis for our server and she was PHENOMENAL. If my boyfriend's drink got a little more than half empty he had a new one there instantly. At no point did we ever have to ask for anything, she was there like clock work.   We ordered apps in the first half and they were OK, nothing special. In the second half we ordered lunch. His chicken sandwich was great but my boneless wings were dried out and a little tough to chew.   The service is what made this visit totally worth it.

We came in for dinner and watch some college football Friday night. Since we've been here multiple times to watch NFL and MLB we know that good service can be provided even when they're crazy busy.   The bar is seat yourself so we sat and waited and waited for someone to come wipe off our table (it was the only one available) and bring us menus. Not a huge deal since they were super busy.   Our server (who will go unnamed) greeted herself and took our drink orders. I ordered a long-island iced tea since they were on special and I haven't had one in forever. It was HORRIBLE, I have had many Long-Islands in my day and this by far was the worst. It was orange, I think they filled the glass half way with sour mix, added some well liquor even though it was supposed to be top-shelf and forgot the splash of coke. Problem is she brought the drink when she took our food order so I didn't get a chance to drink it until she walked away. Normally, I won't say anything, I'll just down the drink and order something else next time. This was so bad and so sour I couldn't even get it down.   Finally I flagged her down and ordered something else, when I told her I would like to get something else because...well i couldn't finish my sentence because her ADHD took over and away she went. I sat there with my mouth opened wondering if I was even talking out loud (my bf assured me I was). She left the drink on the table so I really wasn't certain she heard me.   Then the food came. I had ordered a create-your-own chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. The sandwich came out exactly as I had ordered. However, I had the wrong dressing for my salad and we had no silverware. She dropped off the food, never asked if we wanted anything else and just took off, I tried stopping her but that was a lost cause.   I sat there looking around, trying to make eye-contact with anyone who was glancing my way. Our server was just standing by the bar chit-chatting. Finally someone walked by and I asked if we could get silverware and ketchup, I had high-hopes she would bring me a fork, but she didn't. So there I sit some more, unable to eat my salad. Finally a manager walked by and I asked him, instead of him grabbing it, he shouted for someone else to do it. YAY, I got a fork. Too bad the dressing was wrong (and not tasty) and no server to ask to correct it. Finally when I'm putting my last bite in my mouth she came over and asked how we're doing. Really? You're going to ask me now? UGH.   Well at this point I'm fed up and while we'll probably go to BW3 in the future, it certainly will not be this location.

I had a salad and absolutely loved it. Since Salad Works and Scottsdale Salad Co closed I needed a good place to get lunch from. I never eat in, it's always to go and I think I have found my place.   My coworker had pasta and didn't like it. Since neither of us had been there before we weren't exactly sure on some things. We expected all the veggies in the pasta to be cooked but they weren't.   Everyone was extremely friendly and I can't wait to go back and try some more stuff. Just please move the cookies with Nutella away from the register, they were toooo tempting!

After a few more visits by 4 stars have turned into 5. These folks never disappoint!!  Met my boyfriend here for lunch and wasn't excepting him to love it but he did. His only wishes were there had been more sauce on the pasta (but that can easily be fixed next time)   Today was the first time I've ordered in person, I usually place my order online and pick it up. I was impressed with how quick they were from the second I walked in until I was eating, they were fast and super friendly!

This is my first time at this location and I wish it wasn't the closest one to my new house.  The service was HORRIBLE.   I came in to get a sandwich from the deli, I filled out the form and waited and waited and waited for someone to acknowledge me. Finally some girl shouted to just leave the form sitting there, well if you can't bother to notice me how can I be sure you're going to notice a little piece of paper?  I walked around the store seeing what else I needed only to get back to the deli and see my order slip still sitting on the counter!! So I stood there, the same girl asked if I needed something, "yes, my sandwich 15 min ago". One of the ladies grabbed it.   Now the point of filling out the form is to only get the items listed, no more/no less. I wish that were the case, My sandwich was close but not how I asked for it. I didn't ask for peppers and I did ask for avocado. At the other two locations I frequent often they have yellow mustard packets, I was told this one didn't. I prefer good old fashioned yellow mustard on my sandwiches!    Needless to say I'm not in a big hurry to get a sandwich from here again!   The only reason I'm giving it two stars is my cashier was very friendly.

So far, so good.   I've only been here a couple of times and I don't have any major complaints given the price. The staff is friendly and it's clean.  I have heard they have a pizza night which I strongly disagree with. The point of a gym is to promote a healthy lifestyle. I also could do without the candy at the front desk.

When my fiancé and I started looking for rings, we stopped in a handful of stores to see what was out there with the full intention of buying from his best friend who is a store manager at a very popular jewelry store in town.  When we walked into House of Diamonds, we were quickly greeted by Brent and Lance who quickly asked if we wanted some whiskey and/or wine.  I like these guys already!!  After multiple rings on my finger, they finally put one on that I fell in love with instantly. At that point, I didn't care to try on anymore rings. As we went about our day, stopping at a few more jewelry stores and finishing at the place we initially intended on buy from, I tried on dozens of rings with no luck. I was getting very moody, finally Dan asked me what was wrong. I told him I didn't like ANY of the rings, he shook his head and asked me if we're going back to House of Diamonds. YUP!!  So we went back, I don't think they guys were surprised to see us. This time I took them up on their wine offerings.   We put the ring back on my finger and Lance asked me, "what would you change about this ring" sensing I wasn't 100% in love. I told him, I'd rather have it as a kite style (it's a princess cut). he said DONE! Well that was easy.  He asked what else I would change, I immediately said "price" since 1. it was more than we wanted to pay and 2. my mom always said "it doesn't hurt to ask". He gave us a number that we were more than happy to pay.   He showed me exactly how my ring was going to look with the kite style and I was just as in love with this ring as I was my soon-to-be fiancé.   These guys are amazing. They will work with you to get you exactly what you've been dreaming of, even if you initially had totally different plans.   I can't thank them enough for their hospitality and everything they did to make us happy.

Since we're on an "eating healthy" kick at work we had to try out the new salad place.   I placed our order online, there were some glitches in their system but was assured they are working on it (had to call after my order was placed to change the pick up time since the first available was in three hours). My food was ready for me when I arrived.   My boss who is very picky actually gave his lunch two thumbs up and mine was equally as delicious. We both had the "create your own salad". I didn't care for the basalmic vinaigrette but all the veggies were fresh and crunchy.    I liked it so much I placed another to-go order today, this time getting vegetable soup, it was tasty. The soup wasn't hot but that's probably my fault for not picking it up fast enough.    They do have frozen yogurt with the normal toppings, for $2.00 you can add a small yogurt to your lunch, they need to do a better job of advertising that though. I had to ask them what's up with yogurt since there are no signs and they don't mention it.   The line can get pretty long at lunch time so be prepared.

When you walk through the door you're greeted with an amazing smell (reminded me of when my dad would cook meat in our smoker with apple wood chips when we were kids). Second was how great the restaurant looked, it was clean and inviting. The bartender smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and told us to have a seat anywhere...(time was 12:22)  So far we're off to a great start. So what possibly could have went wrong to cause a 2 star review? Our service.   The bartender brought us over some menus and explained that we could order brunch or lunch, brought us some chips and salsa, then went back to the bar, we didn't see any other server in the restaurant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us. So we sat and sat and sat waiting for our actual server to come by. Keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the restaurant, one was just leaving so we'll call it two.   Let's touch on the chips and salsa. I loved the chips, they were fantastic, however, the salsa was not a "dipping salsa" it had a wonderful flavor and would have been great on a taco salad (why don't you have taco salads?) or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips. There were NO chunks, it was the consistency of hot sauce.   Finally our server greeted us with her presence, she walked up and didn't say "Hi, I'm so-and-so, I'll be taking care of you folks today" or "Welcome to Lenero, have you been here before" or even just "hello" instead she said "what can I get you to drink". I almost responded with an "hi, I'm fine thank you for asking" but I refrained. We ordered our drinks and I asked for an order of guacamole, it's 12:31 at this point (9 min after walking in the door).   There we sat, bored with our chips and salsa, read every yelp review of Lenero, discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. Our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order. Not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions. She walked up and in her snotty tone said "what do you want". Seriously?? That's not how you talk to someone! I was so taken aback by her attitude I decided right then and there we will not be back. This food would have to be sent straight from the Heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restaurant.   I ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas. As she was walking away he mentioned to her we're still waiting on our guac, it's been over 10 min at this point. She seemed surprised by our request to get the guacamole, almost like she just plain forgot I even ordered it.   Finally our guacamole came. TWENTY-ONE minutes after ordering it. By this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone. She gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy. The only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave. That left one table of folks. You're telling me the cook couldn't manage to toss some guacamole together because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaurant? She told us it was on the house. That was nice but I would have rather of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago.   Finally the bartender came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the OWNER'S FAMILY first. So I've been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority?   Our lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good, what the menu doesn't mention is they are street tacos, not normal sized ones. Which was fine by me but I could see where someone else wouldn't have been impressed with 4 really small tacos. The enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish. While we both love spice, again I can see how someone else would not have liked it. If my mom had ordered it she wouldn't have been able to eat it, the dish was that spicy.   Bottom line is we do not have any intentions on coming back. While the food was good, it wasn't phenomenal. The salsa was not ideal for "chips and salsa" and the service was HORRIBLE. It's been a long time since I've had a server that snobby. She should be really lucky we left her 20% because she certainly did not deserve it (I'm having tipper's regret).

Stopped in last night and as usual the service was amazing! The staff here is always fast and they don't skimp on the food. Other locations I can practically see the bottom of the bowl.

After leaving Tailgaters at the half Sunday (after being treated like crap by the manager) 20+ Browns fans piled into this place. Not expecting a large crowd there was only one guy working out front and he did an amazing job!   The drinks and food are cheap. Service is wonderful and we will definitely be back again.   Only complaint is the TV's are too small for Sunday Football unless you're at the bar.

We were in last week for a birthday party in the bar area. Unfortunately, I had a pretty hefty sized lunch so I wasn't very hungry when I came in. I ordered the tortilla soup and it was fantastic, one of the ladies at our table thought it was a bit spicy, however, I didn't taste the spice at all. It had a wonderful flavor and the avocado was a great addition to the soup.   They really made this new location look great. I loved the windows all the way around the restaurant until someone decided they needed to open them. It wasn't warm out, the temps were only in the 60's and it was windy so as soon as the windows opened everyone's napkins started flying around. Most folks appeared to be cold, when people start putting on sweaters/jackets while you're opening the windows, it might be a sign the windows don't need to be open.   Because of this, I wouldn't be back unless it was warm out for fear of freezing to death.

Wow! So far so good!  I came in today for lunch. Had Quinoa Pasta with tofu, tomatoes, cucumbers, broccoli, feta and sesame. It was great! I'm full and satisfied but $10 was a bit much to pay. I think $8-$9 would have been a better price point.   My biggest suggestion is changing the hours from 8-8 to 7-7, it would allow those who work at 8 to grab a juice first.

The first time the food was very tasty. This time it was disgusting, if I had time I would have came back in but I was stuck at work. I ordered the exact same thing I ordered on my first visit.  The quinoa pasta was in chunks (like when you leave elbow pasta on the stove too long and it turns into one gigantic slimy chunk) The broccoli was in such a large clump I had to get a knife to cut it. There was no feta and there was so much sauce on it that the bottom of the container looks like soup.  The flavor was off, it tasted more like sesame oil than sesame sauce.   Very disappointed, I wanted to love this place =(

UGH.   That was a waste of $10 +tax. First off, I waited 11 min for my lunch. They're not making everything from scratch at the time of order. Everything is prepared and ready to scoop, plus when I walked in I didn't wait in line, I went straight to the counter to order, it wasn't busy!!!   I ordered a "create your own" with Brown Rice, Chicken, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Broccoli, Feta, Cilantro and Sesame Sauce.   While lunch did look appealing when I opened the box I quickly realized there was NO SAUCE, the chicken was tough and the brown rice must have been sitting in a rice cooker for days.   WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO GET RIGHT.   The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is the cashier was super friendly, asked if I needed any help with the menu and repeated everything back to make sure she had it right. Which she did, the folks shoving food in a box got it wrong....AGAIN.

I called prior to placing an order to make sure I could have them in a few days. The guy on the phone said ABOLUTELY, so I went online to place the order. I roughly placed the logo on the shirt with a note for them to adjust it so it's centered properly.  When I was about finished it said the turn-around time would be a week.  So I called back to verify again they could do it in my time frame and that they would just note the order.  The guy said it would be faster if he just took the order over the phone, I wasn't sure how, but why not. After going over everything he said I could either submit the payment on the phone to him or on their website. So I told him I'd just finish the online order and verified the purchase would be based on our conversation, I also emailed him a copy of the logo since we weren't basing it on the online order.  When I sent someone to pick up the shirts, they weren't ready on time. They were available that afternoon instead of morning. Not a huge deal. But, having our company logo on the wrong side of the shirt was the issue.  I contact the company and they couldn't care less they made my shirts wrong.   So instead of me placing another order, this time much larger, I am certainly going with someone else. What a waste of time and money!

We stopped in on a whim one Friday night to play a little roulette and slots. When I signed up for a players card they had a promotion to get a free night's stay if you accumulate so many points. Well we easily did it and because it was December we were able to stay during the week since I wasn't working Christmas Eve morning.   Our hotel room was AMAZING. Between the large TV, comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom it was a perfect stay plus we stayed in our budget of how much money were willing to lose.

I was super excited when I saw they added a Potbelly to North Scottsdale. Today was my second visit.   I had the Chicken and Cheddar sandwich, it's very basic. Chicken, Cheese, Bread (lettuce, tomato, pickles) but it was phenomenal. I also added a cup of vegetable soup which was surprisingly very tasty.   I ordered online this time, my sandwich was ready but they still needed to scoop the soup which I appreciated. Nothing worse than cold soup.

We're always looking for a good Thai restaurant, especially in North Phoenix. I was torn between 3 stars and 4 so I went with the benefit of the doubt.   We came in last Saturday for lunch and the place was dead, we were the only two in there the whole entire time. Since we were there during prime lunch hours, that doesn't speak positively for the future of the restaurant.   I ordered grilled pot stickers with a side of vegetables and my boyfriend ordered Sweet and Sour Chicken. For what I paid, my food was good. James on the other hand, asked for his to be a level 3 on the spicy scale and it was only a 1. He's a HUGE fan of cucumbers in his Sweet and Sour Chicken, this only had 2 pieces and the rest of the dish wasn't fantastic. He said he would definitely order something else next time even though that's his go-to dish =\  My biggest issue was the water. It tasted HORRIBLE! It had a funky smell as well. I decided to just go thirsty, James however, purchased a Pepsi.    I do not understand why they have such great lunch specials during the week but they do not offer them on the weekends. I think we would definitely be willing to give it another chance (assuming their nasty water was a one time deal) but only if they had lunch specials on the weekends. They have no customers, what do they have to lose???

We stopped in on a whim Saturday night. While the menu didn't instantly impress us, we decided while we're here we might as well give it a shot.  I am soooo glad we did. WOW, the service and food were phenomenal. They brought out house chips with a chipotle sauce that were spot on.  I ordered the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger. Everything was better than we expected.  We finished it off with an Apricot Cheesecake that came with Vanilla Bean ice cream. Again...WOW.   We left stuffed and excited to go back again!!   As for the other reviews, to complain the U.S. Flag is displayed everywhere seems very Un-American to me. I'm a die-hard liberal and I didn't find anything offensive or that would point to the owners being right wing. Yeah they like country music and are proud of their country's flag. That doesn't make them conservative, it makes them Americans!!

This location is the newest style. They have comfy chairs to sit by next to the fire place, what looks like fresh baked cookies, TVs and a digital menu. I must give Wendy's kudos for this new design.   We stopped in yesterday for a quick bite. Everything came out exactly as ordered and the staff was super friendly. My only suggestion would be trying to upsell cookies at the register. My bf would have definitely purchased one, but didn't think of it until after we paid.

I'm a member at the Moon Valley location and I gotta say, this location is so much better. I was on my way to Gilbert and decided to stop in for a workout since I had an hour to spare. The facility was clean and the folks working were very friendly.   I wasn't a big fan of "specialty equipment" being in the stretching area. ASU girl working on their inner thigh muscles for the better part of 20 min, It's really congested in there. I prefer Moon Valley where the area is designed for those who are done with their workout to stretch and do abs.   But, if both locations were side by side, I'd definitely come here though.

I'm a little shy when it comes to going to events where I don't really know anyone. After getting my drink tokens I made a beeline to the bar for a glass of wine and with the help of BINGO I was chatting up a storm with everyone I encountered. Folks sang to me -as a duet no less-, talked like an Australian and told me to sit my butt down and eat some wonderful appetizers with them. By the end of the night I met some great folks (the highlight was finally meeting Rand H.) I loved just relaxing with a glass of wine and girl talk with some amazing ladies I had never met before but can't wait to hear updates on their lives =)  Outback has always had their mushrooms on their "secret menu" so we always order them when we come in, they are my favorite, in a close second was the Margarita Flatbread,   I love that Lindsey recognized me when I walked in and mentioned me being there for my second Elite event, she's so sweet!

I am in love with this place!  We came in because they serve KCCO beer (The Chive) but stayed because of the beer/wine list, the brownies and the service!  When we first walked the guys with me gave me the look of "really, you're taking us to this tiny, little bar" but as soon as they checked out the beer list on the wall, they were set. We laughed, played trivia pursuit and made new friends.   Like someone else said in their review, "I almost don't want you to know about The Whining Pig, because I don't want it to blow up too fast." I agree. Seating is very limited in this place and there isn't a lot of room to move around.   Kudos to the owner, you did a great job and we will be back with friends sometime very soon!!

I came in this weekend for a FREE yoga class for their grand opening and loved it! I'm a huge fan of hot yoga and when I saw we were getting a Sumits in North Phoenix I was ecstatic!  They did a wonderful job with this studio, it's very warm, bright and inviting.   Once my membership at my current studio expires I will be purchasing one here, it's less than 5 miles from my house!

As a surprise for my mother I purchased her a DELUXE MANI/PEDI on Groupon. She mentioned she needed a pedicure desperately so I searched Groupon for something that was above and beyond the basic service, she scheduled an appointment yesterday.   Based on other Groupons there is the difference between a basic and a deluxe (taken from multiple different deals): * The deluxe mani/pedi comes with a sugar scrub, as well as a paraffin treatment. The basic mani/pedi only includes filing, cutting/trimming, cleaning, and nail polish application. * The deluxe mani-pedi swaddles feet in steaming hot-towel treatments before a massage loosens tense leg sinews and kneads sore hand muscles.  * The deluxe manicure or pedicure is twice as long as the regular treatment and includes twice as much hand or foot massage, plus a hydrating mud masque or a soothing  paraffin dip. *  The basic mani/pedi only includes filing, cutting/trimming, cleaning, and nail polish application. The deluxe mani/pedi includes a scrub/soak & paraffin treatment.  As you can see it's pretty standard across the board that a DELUXE mani/pedi includes more than just slapping some lotion on the legs, trimming and painting the toe nails. (The Groupon also mentions they have a standard and a deluxe, I'd hate to see what the standard gets you)  This however was NOT my mother's experience. She was told it was an additional $5 for her to use a salt scrub and an additional $5 for her to use a file on her heels These are all services that should be included in a DELUXE pedi, if it's not then they should have just called it a basic pedi and saved me $25.  The lady next to my mom was just leaving with beautiful toes. My mom assumed the glitter on her toes was from glitter nail polish, who wouldn't? Well my mom asked if she could have that same polish on her toes, little did my mom know that it was actually regular polish with glitter applied, oh and it would be a $5 charge which she was told AFTER the fact.   So I spent $25 for the Groupon, my mom spent $15 on charges that should have been included since it was a DELUXE PEDICURE. Then when my mom went to pay the $20 the lady had the nerve to ask her if she needed change back. You NEVER assume a tip, my mom would have tipped her on her own, but to ask for one is HORRIBLE customer service.   I called yesterday for clarification and the lady who spoke way too fast for me to completely understand seemed to think it was pretty funny we were over charged, lied to and treated poorly, she stated the reason they say deluxe is it gets more people in the door.  I will NEVER make an appointment here, my mother will NEVER be back and hopefully you won't either.

We stopped in for the first time based on a recommendation of another Yelper.  The chairs are extremely comfortable, but the artwork on the wall is very strange. I don't get it. It seems like they just decided to hang ugly paintings instead of actually painting the walls, they are very dirty.   Our service was ok, but I assume she was new. I ordered 2 tacos a la carte and my boyfriend ordered a meal which comes with beans and rice. We then headed up to the salsa bar to accompany our chips. There were sooo many to choose from. I loved the green salsa and who would have known salsa made from radishes would actually be really tasty??  Our tacos were great, the beans didn't taste like they were from a can and the meat was cooked perfectly. The only issue I had with my lunch were the taco shells, I feel like they were a little too soggy.

After a second visit, I am happy to bump up my rating to 5 stars!!   Noon probably wasn't the best time to come, but they get you through that line very quickly. Everyone was professional, friendly and on their "A-Game"! My buddy ordered a pizza to go and they offered to put it in the food warmer to keep it nice and toasty while we enjoyed our lunch.   I ordered the tomato basil pizza with mushrooms and it was fantastic. When it was handed to the guy running the oven, he asked the guy to toss on a few more mushrooms. I liked that he took the time to look over the pizza to make sure it was up to his standards.   This location is now in our regular lunch rotation (on days I'm not convinced I should be on a diet).

Welcome to Firehouse!!  I hate to admit it but I like Subway, I go there often during lunch but when the boss is paying, you go where he wants. So a couple months ago he suggested we stop here for lunch. Ehhhh, I don't really like trying new foods. Besides hiring me, this was the best decision he has ever had!  I ordered the Capt. Sorensen's Datil Pepper Grilled Chicken and fell instantly in love. They claim it's under 500 calories but I think that's a lie, it takes way tooooo good.   I've been here more than subway in the past few months and I'm happy to say, I love this place. I also love that you have Mellow Yellow, no one ever has that anymore.   I can't comment on any other sandwich since I refuse to try anything different. I crave this sandwich.

I initially heard about Orange Theory Fitness on the radio but tried it for the first time when there was a Yelp Elite event a couple months ago. I loved how I felt after my first class - my legs burned, it hurt to lift my water bottle to my face, I was physically exhausted.   I had a feeling that I can't get on my own at the gym. No matter how great my intentions are, I just can't seem to push myself to the point of breaking.  At Orange Theory there isn't someone yelling in your face to push it harder, but it's expected that you're going to keep up with the class. You're not going to lower the resistance on the treadmill until you're told to. You're going to do all the reps with the weights. You're going to hustle back and forth between the weights and the rowers. It's almost like peer pressure to push yourself. But, hey, whatever it takes right?  When I heard they were opening an OTF near my house, it got me thinking about how much I loved that workout. So I called to find out how much the pre-sale rates were going to be. I talked to Dane for quite a while about my goals and what I did/didn't like about my initial experience at OTF. He convinced me to sign up but to head up to Happy Valley for a free class, if I loved it...GREAT, If not, then just give him a call back before the studio opens and he'll cancel my membership. That seemed like a fair enough deal.   I went up to Happy Valley last Friday and loved it, come Sunday morning, it still hurt to sit and I regretted living in a three story townhouse.   Over the weekend they were offering preview sessions for non-members and members if they brought a non-member with them. Well unfortunately my guest had something come up at the last min so I went anyway, I was already in workout clothes, what was I supposed to do? So yesterday I went for my first workout at this studio and loved it. The instructor was very upbeat and friendly.  I wish they were opening the studio sooner than Dec 4th, I'm going on a cruise in January and have a lot of work to do in the next 59 days.   While the price is not what I want to pay monthly on top of my other gym membership, I am getting a workout I can not get on my own which seems invaluable.

This was my first time at a Señor Taco and since I work a mile down the road, I thought I would have a new place to add into my lunch rotation. I was wrong.   The cashier seemed annoyed that I was taking a while to review the menu. Well I've never been there before and wanted to make sure I checked out everything and despite being really hard to read. I even had my glasses on but found myself squinting to read the board, whomever designed that system wasn't using his thinking cap.  When I finally ordered, I asked for the two taco combo with chicken. I asked a couple questions regarding my order such as what's on tacos and wasn't really given a real answer. I asked if they had sour cream, instead of saying yes or no, I got a "do you want sour cream?" Nope! Then we moved on so I'm still not sure if there's normally sour cream or not. I asked for flour tortillas but was given corn. I hate corn tortillas. So I ended up just dumping the contents of the tacos into my container and eating it like that.   The customer service was horrific. The cashier kept pulling her pants up but was getting surprisingly low into her pants to accomplish her task of covering her midsection. No one looked clean and professional. I seriously worry about the cleanliness of the kitchen based on the staff.   The only reason it's getting 2 stars instead of one. The chicken was fantastic.

I've been here a total of three times. The third time was the straw that broke the camel's back.   The first time I ordered the veggie sandwich with no sauce. It had sauce, a lot mayo-naise looking sauce. I don't do mayo, so when I took it up to the counter, she grabbed it out of my hand so hard the sandwich slid from the plate. My lunch partner was done eating by the time they brought me a different one. it's literally just bread and veggies. No cooking required.   The second time I ordered just a bowl of soup. From the time I ordered until the time it was given to me was 23 min. When I told the food runner, she said "well the drive thru takes priority". Rude.   Today I did the drive-thru thinking it would be much faster and it's the closest place to work I can get soup without getting out of my car. It wasn't quick by any means but it was decent. I ordered a half-sandwich and a cup of soup. I ordered Asiago Bisque. I'm thinking it's like a tomato bisque but instead of tomatoes they used a boatload of cheese.  Ham. It had ham. Why? I don't eat ham, I can't eat ham.  So now here I sit with a cup of soup in the garbage can (there was no one at work to give it to) and a belly that's not quite full.   Three attempts. Three disappointments.
