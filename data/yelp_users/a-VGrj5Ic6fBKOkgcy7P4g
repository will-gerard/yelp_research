Beverly Canyon for beginner hikes. Park at 46th St & Baseline, really easy to find parking. Take the Javalina Trail to Beverly Canyon to West Loop.  If you get lost, just follow the trail underneath the power lines back to your car.  Pretty cool, right?  You can see the power lines from everywhere.  Great tip from a friend!  this is a good interactive map:   http://mtbikeaz.com/trail-index/phoenix/south-mountain-park-trail-map/  other parking lots near Tempe / Chandler / Ahwatukee: 1.  type in "pima canyon rd, phoenix, az" in google maps.  it's basically what Guadalupe Rd turns into west of the I-10.  2.  type in "760 s desert foothills pkwy, phoenix, az" in google maps for directions.  park there, on the north/east side of the street.  head north to the telegraph pass entrance.  if you're a mountain biker, check the maps for rideup trailheads.

They sold me a fish with Monster ICH!!!  It was horrible, persistent, completely covered all the fish, was medication resistant, killed all but one of my fish :(  You would think that a professional aquarium store like this would quarantine their fish before putting them in the display tanks and teach their employees what ich was, so they could avoid selling sick fish to customers.    So disappointing.  I've asked for a refund and help several times, they're horrible, won't let me speak to a manager, interrupt me, tell me it's my fault for not purchasing $40 more of equipment, sell me more fish, give me the run-around, are rude, shady people in general.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.

My go to place for cheap sushi.  Don't miss happy hour or reverse happy hour for half price rolls.  They're about $3.  Best deal in town!  The place is super good and fantastic atmosphere.  Their fish tank is gorgeous and the inside has beautiful water features.

If you like PF Chang's, but not the price tag, definitely come here. The mongolian beef is identical, same portion (small), half the price. Spring rolls are tasty too. They also have lettuce wraps, like PF Chang's is known for. Their menu is small and compared to PF Chang's the prices are low, but I think their competition is Tott's Asian Diner right down the street.  Lower prices, bigger menu, same stirfry wok's, spectacular service, clean, super nice owner who remembers your name for years :)

100% prettiest, fanciest place i've ever seen in my life.  absolutely breathtaking.  from the lobby with rock features and waterfall, to the lit up painted ceiling, to the enormous pools that overlook golf courses and lakes as well as wide 360 views of the surrounding mountains, etc... just... wow.  even the stairs have little decorations as big as my head.  a random pot of flowers sitting in a corner was twice as tall as me.  i felt like a little ant.

The best key sega watt (spicy beef cubes) in town!  My only complaint would be the high prices and lack of service on water refills (when i'm eating something spicy, i expect LOTS of water refills).  It's definitely filling and the ingera bread is actually really healthy for you... it's made with TEFF, a type of flour.  If you like meat, don't let your tastebuds miss the key sega watt!

Super helpful staff in the aquarium department. They have a really nice, clean healthy stock of freshwater and saltwater fish and invertebrates. I was telling them about a horrible experience I had with Aquarium Arts (a store in mesa) selling me a sick fish that devastated my entire tank. The guy working at this Petco reassured me that they're super knowledgeable and careful about sick fish and quarantine everything before they stock.

I really really wanted to love zerorez. I hear John jay and rich talk about them all the time on the radio and so many reviewers said they make carpets look like new. I wasn't really impressed with the results. I have a bissel steam cleaner and honestly get the same results with that thing. The only good part about using zerorez is if you have kids and pets, it's safer than chemicals and won't leave a residue. the guy that came out was really nice. I'd wait for a special and just get rooms with simple stains cleaned, forget about high traffic areas.

Zerorez came out again, free of charge to try to make me happy. Well, they did a wonderful job this time and addressed my concerns with the high traffic areas. They brought a special tool out this time. They're really good with customer service and doing what they can to make things right. Carpets look great now!

I had a good experience with them.  My car is super clean.  The outside definitely sparkles!  They didn't use alot of slimy stuff on the dashboard, but there's a bit on the side doors and everything where I put my feet.  I was sliding all over the place, but it's ok.  Either way, they got all the much needed dirt out and I'm happy with the price... one of the first Groupons I bought that was actually worth it and not a rip off.  I wish they had better air fresheners (the ones in the cans that you put under the seat are great), they just have really weak ones.  I'll be back to finish up my groupons :)

i'm a local and decided to check this place out with a couple of friends.  we decided to chill by the cozy pool and dip our legs into the jacuzzi.  we loved the fire and waterfall features.  the main lobby area was very comfortably laid out and inspires guests to mingle with each other.  the beds by the pools were very comfy and i loved the little sand bonfire.

Best service in town, hands down!  The waiter got to us as soon as we sat down outside and his timing was perfect and non intrusive during our whole meal.  The menu is pretty simple, but it has the classic taco or burrito that you can customize.  You have to pay $1.75 for chips and salsa, but honestly it was one of my favorite salsas I've ever had.  It kind of reminded me of Macayo's, but a tad spicier... it was very flavorful, which I love.

Dirty tables everywhere! Sticky, grimy, old drink machine.  I had the chicken gyro, it wasn't great, kind of dry. Just cut up strips of chicken with pepper. I was the only one in the place when they started emptying out the garbage in front of me. I hate when places do that while I'm eating!

I came here to sit around and do some sketching.  I ended up sitting under a tree near the catfish stocked pond, which is actually big enough to give you a nice, outdoorsy lake feel.  People were sitting around in lounge chairs fishing, feeding ducks, you can see a few turtles here and there near the shore, on the other side of the lake/pond, there's a swampier area where you can see alot of interesting birds.  It's definitely a relaxing retreat, the buildings are close to the lake, there's a library, so it's kind of a park, only bigger, yet smaller than Tempe Town Lake.  Hope that makes sense and gives you an idea.

Wow this place sucks.  We were in a hurry to go ice skating down the street, so we popped into the first place we saw that was open and not crowded.  We ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich after looking at the prices for pizza.  A tiny personal pizza was about $7.  The sandwich was also $10, but we figured we'd split it.  They asked us if we'd like a large and we said yes after some thought.  It came out about 45 minutes later.  It was literally just an overbaked piece of chicken and some cheese on some crappy bread.  It was tiny.  I'd hate to see what the "regular" size was.  What a waste of time and money!

The general tso chicken was really good!  They give you alot of food, everything came out really nice and hot.  The only thing bad I would say about this place is that it's probably not the best place to go for a fancy sit-down dinner.  Definitely a take-out place.  You can see the kitchen from the seating area.  It's clean, but it looks fast food, dive style.

I went there today to get my car washed, used a groupon.  It's the cleanest I've ever seen it in years.  I watched for 45 minutes as the man (I wish I would've gotten his name) scrubbed and scrubbed the interior and used this AWESOME smelling strawberry spray.  It smells and looks AMAZING!!!  I've had "just ok" service from this place before at other locations, but this location is my absolute favorite now.  I'll definitely be back for more!  I've tried some of the air fresheners they sell inside.  The only ones that really work are the ones that come in the sealed cans... all the other gel pads and stuff don't work well at all, so don't waste your money on anything but the CANS!  before i left, the guy asked me to make sure that i was happy with everything also.  i think that was PERFECT customer service.  they obviously want you to drive away happy and guarantee their work.

Best place I've ever volunteered at!  They're super organized and efficient.  Bring your friends and family, I guarantee you'll have fun packing food boxes.  You can pick different jobs at your packing table, they play music and you watch a video before you start.  They'll give you a tutorial of what to do.  Everyone is super nice and you'll be making a big difference to starving children all over the world.

Super therapeutic! Everyone seems to have a different experience in the floating pod. I went through the full range of emotions from freaking out at first to relaxing, then laughing. Some people fall asleep, some people bring their own music and relax (you can hook your own music up to an ipod connection in the room). You control the lights, which are BEAUTIFUL. The staff was amazingly friendly. I thought the salt water felt like vaseline.  The goodies you get after your float are 5-star as well. Softest towels in your shower ever. Shampoo/Conditioner/Lotion that smells heavenly. Free tea, water and oxygen bar in the waiting room when you're done. Cute little private makeup rooms to get ready and do your hair. They have blow driers, lotions, tons of mirrors with good lighting and magnification, couches, etc.  You'll definitely feel relaxed, refreshed and pampered!

Great boba and service!  The large cup is actually a large, unlike other boba places.  The donuts are yummy and the person behind the counter was super nice!  I got the blended mocha boba and my boyfriend got the cookies and cream.  I tried both and they were both delicious.  The only thing missing was the cute little lids, they just put them in regular plastic cups.  They're also a tad bit pricey for me to do on a regular basis, but it's the perfect treat.

It's like cinabon meets donut.  Really super amazingly yummy.  They come out hot, glazed, customized however you want.  It's about $1.89 a donut, but you only want to order maybe 1 or 2 per person, they fill you up.  It's a cute place to possibly take a date.

I don't understand why anyone would ever come here? They follow you around the store and hassle you, the check out line all 3 times I went in goes all the way to the back of the store. The girls up front are not only slow, but have catty attitudes and I swear you can buy a car faster than it takes them to sign you up for their emails and promotions and whatever crap they ask you about up front. And the deals aren't even that great. $7 for a one-time use face mask that has Chinese directions on it? Ok. I asked to try their "best" sunscreen/foundation and it left my face a greasy, caked mess. Most of the stuff they carry, you can find at any drug store and they're cleaner and not sticky and opened/tried by everyone with annoying orange price tags all over them. But this store is technically in the mall area. Malls are notoriously known for high prices and annoying customer service. Not sure why people even go to them, but ok, have fun standing in line for a couple hours to buy waxy, over-priced crap with the main ingredients being water, or soap.

Got the machaca beef burrito. Soooo juicy.  Great value!  Nice, big portion, under $6.  The salsa is too spicy for me, I wish they had an ultra-mild.  Best cheap/value mexican place in the area.  I used to go to Amado's, but this is closer, has wifi, newly remodeled, cute outside patio, about the same prices/portions.  The first time I went here, the wait time was a little long, they had lots of people (usually a great indicator that the place is good though!), but it was super fast last time (still had lots of people eating/in line also). :)
