Sadly, I missed dinner service here so a couple of associates and I grabbed a late-night dessert at this lovely Italian restaurant.  We were very impressed with the atmosphere of this restaurant. Although we chose to sit outside, the location proved to be very hidden and private-- perfect spot to take your date! Our server was perfect and extremely attentive. Even though he knew we were only ordering desserts, he still took the time to go through their best options. We decided to go with a couple glasses of wine, some coffee, and a Tiramisu to share. The attention on our table was never lost, in fact, as the night grew chilly, our server came back and helped move a heat lamp closer to our table to keep warm.  The Tiramisu was excellent and I'm truly sorry to say I wasn't able to experience more of their great food! Will definitely be back on the next trip!

Cowboy Ciao was an overall great dining experience!   A group of six of us grabbed some late-night eats here immediately after a four-hour flight into the city. Our server was fantastic-- although we arrived less than two hours before their closing time, she greeted our group with much enthusiasm and satisfied all our curiosities about their menu highlights and extensive wine list. The atmosphere is classy, warm, and inviting-- a perfect date night spot!  Although I limited myself to a bowl of soup, I was able to sample some of my group's picks, which included The Stetson Chopped Salad (phenomenal), truffled mac & cheese (great!), Buffalo Carpaccio, and the Berkshire Pork Belly (very delicious).  Everyone walked away with a positive dining experience and only great things to say about their food. Next time I'm in town, I'll be returning to this spot!

Oh my goodness.  This place is one of the reasons I would return to Vegas--especially with an empty stomach. My boyfriend and I decided to try this restaurant on a whim after reading the terrific reviews. It did not disappoint. We came here for breakfast and were seated on their lovely patio. I love the d√©cor, the atmosphere, and the casual feel as you watch people stroll walk by as you're eating. It's a very cozy and comfortable restaurant. Service was fantastic. I ordered the Chocolate-Hazelnut Waffle with Nutella and fresh whipped cream. It is easily the best waffle I have ever had. Their whipped cream was also spectacularly delicious. I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place, my only wish was that we dined here for a more substantial meal like dinner. Yum, I can't wait to go back!

This place is an indecisive diner's worst nightmare! The menu is huge and features most everything one could think of!  We experienced very good service here. The food is average but the portions are huge! Prices are relatively cheap, just be prepared to walk away with a doggy bag!

Wow, may I say....definitely overrated?  I was determined to try this place after hearing people rave about their delicious desserts. Not too hungry, I went to their window to order a cup of their famous frozen hot chocolate. Firstly, it took forever for them to prepare my drink. Secondly, when it was finally ready, the kid at the counter called out a frozen Oreo hot chocolate. Normally, I would not say anything, but since I paid $11 for a blended frozen beverage and went out of my way to try this place, I wanted exactly what I ordered. The kid at the counter (who also took my order) then starts arguing with me, claiming I ordered the "Oreo". He then proceeded to call the attention of his manager, also a kid, and she also gave me a hard time about my order although she was relying entirely on the kid who took my order.   All in all, I felt berated and unnecessarily confronted over re-making my drink that probably costs them less than $.50 to produce. Don't let kids handle your business. I will not be back.
