I made the mistake of strolling into Landis first.  Well, actually, it wasn't a mistake, because it helped me really appreciate how cool the guys at Sun Cyclery are.  I got Josh's undivided attention for as long as it took for me to test ride, choose and accesorize my bike.  There wasn't a question he couldn't answer or a tip about this bike or that.  I ended up with a beautifl 3G that just happens to match my car.  But it gets better.  When I went to pick up my bike, Joe helped my put my ancient bike rack on the back of my PT in the middle of the day - roasting hot sun - and he did it all with a smile!  Josh is a genius at accesories, but not at all pushy.  Adam took time to say hi and say he was glad I had wandered in.  While I was there, I watched various associates giving excellent service to everyone who was there.  Best purchasing experience I have had in AGES.  Oh, and it gets better.  In two or three months I take my totally amazing bike back for a free tune-up!  Yay!  A word to the wise - if you don't speak bike don't to go Landis - go to Sun Cyclery.

Dr. Riley has been my doc for 6 or 7 years now.  When I first went to his office, I was confused.  There weren't a ton of people in the waiting room.  I didn't have to wait one hour in the waiting room and another hour in the room.  As soon as Dr. Riley walked in, I started my "speed-recitation of current symptoms" - (this because my previous MD actually would look at his watch and note the time - and then do it again at the end of the "consult") - Dr. Riley listened calmly.  I was confused again, when he didn't just tell me I could pick up my prescription at the counter on my way out.  He actually TALKED with me.  He asked questions.  He didn't make a mad dash for the door!  Miraculous!!  And the good news is that this has not changed in all these years.  I don't have insurance, so Dr. Riley works with me on that.  He and his wife, the staff, everyone is great in this little gem of an office.  Dr. Riley is a real FAMILY doctor - he is always there for you.  What more could you possibly ask for?

Rosa's is kind of a Mormon staple - it's being so close to the Temple and all.  I have been there countless times, but my last visit on June 3, 2009 was an unqualified disaster.  Service was painfully slow.  The food, normally good for Baja, was lousy.  We complained to the person who was pointed out as the manager - Bert - and he was less than interested in our problem.  He basically said, "There's nothing I can do for you."  Awesome business skills.  Well, there is something we can do for him.  The five of us, and our families and anyone we can dissuade, will not be patronizing Rosa's ever again.  There is a lot better Baja in the Valley.  I think they are resting on their laurels.  Oh, and the best part?  We found out that the good regular chef wasn't there - and that a DISHWASHER had been recruited to fill in with the other regular chef.  Seems that clogged up the kitchen, because it took them a while to call in another dishwasher.

So, I walk in to KFC - already savoring my extra crispy chicken - only to find out that the FLIPPING CHICKEN NAZIS HAVE DONE AWAY WITH EXTRA CRISPY!!!!!!  All they have now is original and grilled.  Excuse me - but I don't need the food industry to regulate my diet!!!! It is my inalienable right to clog my arteries.  I am not on any kind of government assisted health care.  I pay my own medical bills - so let's not act like I am abusing the medical care system.  Oh -this just pisses me off.  No more KFC for me.  The end.

I was a little skeptical, at first blush.  The place looked a bit sterile - and after my recent outing to True Food, I groaned inwardly.  I like shi-shi places, but I also want good food.  I think I have to get out more because the menu was difficult for me to understand.  Fortunately, I had my son with me and he was able to interpret.  Oh, and kudos to our server, Amy.  She provided very good descriptions of the foods.  I finally decided on the Poulet Rouge. Oh, and we had some awesome appetizers - pancetta, and some brie-like cheese and some little green stuff and bread - and some fuit cake like thing - it was all VERY good.  The chicken was amazing.  I thought I had finally landed in Heaven.  Tender and crisp and so very flavorful!  After True Food - I was transported.  I know this is an unfair comparison - kind of like comparing WeightWatchers to Paula Dean -there is a lot to be said for fat.  Yum!  I am a fan of smaller portions.  I have been fighting my weight forever, and now that it is finally down, I want to keep it there.  I never go to Claim Jumpers.  My chicken dish was huge though!  I had the brownie for dessert and I should have passed.  I was way to full to enjoy it.  We should have shared.  We had wine, sparkling water and digestifs.  Walked out for 131.00 for two before tax.  Not an every month even, but will definetly return.

If you are looking for impeccable vintage clothing, this is the place.  Also, if you want to have more fun dressing up than you have had in a long, long time, this is the place.  Veronica loves her clothes!  She loves to see you in them!  The shop is awesome.  I came away with 4 dresses, a pair of shoes and a hat.  I am SO ready for Easter!  The prices are great - very fair for the quality and condition of the items in the store.  Veronica is a gas.  She knows her stock backwards and forwards - she doesn't lie.  If something is not for you, she will let you know.  She had a lucite purse that almost gave me a heart attack - but I already had all this other stuff.... there is no pressure - the shop is fun - if you start to hyperventilate, there is a bookstore next door.  Go rest and dive back in the Alley.  Seriously, this was sooooooooo much more fun that Macy's or even Nordies.

If you are the type of person who is going to get his/her thong all in a knot over prices of vintage candy and other fun stuff, you are not worthy to cross this threshhold.  No one wants a Sour Lemon drip in this very happy place.  I found Charms!  Fire Balls!  Skull cupcake molds - and I lusted after a few lunch boxes until I remembered that I am retired.  Kid's chopsticks - real kaleideoscopes - the good ones - tin and all - and the atmosphere just rocks.  I loved, loved, loved it - and I will be back.  My only disappointment was that they didn't have Life Savers!!! What's up with that???  I guess I have to keep going to Michael's for my Butter Rums. The next thing I am going to buy is that cool plate with the face on it.  You use it as a foundation and dress it up with your food - I LOVE PLAYING WITH MY FOOD!!!

I love DB so have been curious to try Revo out.  I went there today and had a vegetarian burrito with a wheat tortilla, a sugar-free(stevia) lemonade, and a gluten free chocolate cake thinggy.  First, the food - meh - it was okay - the rice was moist and the veggies crispy - but there was absolutely no wow factor.  Good thing they put salt in the take out bag too.  If you do not absolutely love stevia - and/or licorice flavored lemonade, don't go there - I wish they would just have it unsweetend and let you add your own poison - mine would be truvia - the cake thinggy was chocolatey - and the white stuff in the middle was tasty - and it was gluten free - so for a gluten free cake, it was pretty good - but again - no wow.  But then, maybe this type of food is not intended to have "wow"?  I felt kind of like I do at True Food.  In my heart of hearts I am not really loving this experience - but I am thinking that I am doing something GOOD for my body - so, as with exercise - I hope there is some gain with pain - maybe better antioxidant levels or something - NOT weight gain.  This healthy journey ran around 15 bucks - not unreasonable for what I got.

I don't come here often, but I am ALWAYS happy when I do.  I bring in small stuff and it is always received as though it were the most important job of the day.  I love Dennis.  He is so concerned with providing me with the best possible results and his staff is great.  I see his business is rated as pricey - and I guess it is.  I sew.  I have a sewing machine.  I have a room in which to sew.  However, Dennis and his staff do what I do about a thousand times faster and better.  His work is worth every penny and I will always bring my stuff to his store.

Nice, comfortable studio managed by a very able and professional trainer.  Melissa is a consumate professional.  She keeps an eye on every move you make, regardless of the size of the class.  There is a nice mix of mat and reformer work.  The other thing I love about this place is the people who come here.  Very relaxed - friendly - I am a chubby girl and don't  have the bendability of the my more svelte students, but I don't feel uncomfortable.  Also, my K-Mart leggings are good here - not talking the Lulu Lemon, Lucy set - not that they aren't nice, just saying...  One of the best things is that you can make and cancel all your appointments on line!!! Wowza.  That is great!  No painful phone calls.  I cannot say enough good things about this studio and the people who run it and teach.  I never thought I would be comfortable in a pilates class, but lo and behold!  I almost look forward to going!

Where to begin?  Yes, it is a bit pricey.  But not too pricey.  It pays to become a member - and membership is free.  The place is very uh...trendy.  Nice places to sit and wait for your movie to begin.  You can also have dinner here or get sloshed at the bar before your movie.  I think, at some point this may present some problems.   The staff is very courteous.  There were more lovely boys there than I have seen anywhere - many, many lovely boys.  I think they are the wait-staff for the Gold seats.  But we will get to that.    The ticket sales are by machine or by human.  Lovely people behind a nice counter.  Your choices are Premier (17.50 w/o membership) no perks; and Gold - I forget the price, something like in the 20's and I don't remember if the blanket and pillow were a perk with our without the membership.  Yes, you read that right.  With the Gold you also get a lovely boy to fetch your food to your seat - even your wine.  Since we were Premier, when we went to collect our food we were told we were in the wrong place - that we had to go back to the counter.  The food on the trays was for the people in the expensive seats. So now we know.  There is a menu at this place!  The popcorn is available, but nowhere to be seen.  And the butter machine hasn't arrived yet.  Everything seems to have a starting price of 4.50 and goes up as high as you would like it to go, I presume.  There are all sorts of lovely boys to point you in the right direction.  We went into theater 5.  We blundered into a section of orange seats.  So you don't make the same mistake, here is a heads up.  The Gold seats are actually the orange ones and the gold seats are the premier seats.  There are these little trays for your stuff.  If you are skinny, you can actually bring the tray over your lap - unless you like to cross your legs, in which case, this is a no go.  The seats are those theater things like you would have at your home theater, but they don't recline - well, the Premiers don't - don't know about the Orange ones - I mean Gold priced ones(?).    You don't get the annoying Dolby thing or the THX thing or the Turn of Your Cell Phone thing or the Shut up and and watch the movie thing - which leads me to make a suggestion - PLEASE HAVE EAR PHONES PROVIDED - I only say this, because I think the idea is to kind of imitate a home theatre atmosphere except you are stuffed in with a bunch of strangers - and what if a bunch of them are sloshed - or simply being themselves, just like they would be at home?  The bathrooms are impressive, but here is another heads up.  The little thinggie that tells you whether the loo is vacant or occupied is really, really small, so you kind of have to stick your nose under the long bar thing that opens these floor to ceiling door.  The other thing is that the hole for locking the door is really, really, really tiny - so aim well or you will have people walking in on you - I walked in on someone, so I know.  The screen is awesome - overall I liked the thing and I joined and I will be back - this time I am going for Gold - I mean Orange - oh whatever and hope that I get a beautiful, beautiful boy to tend to my needs.  In my next review, I will tell you about the blanket and the pillow.  Stay tuned.

Granted that they have just opened.  However, they have several other outlets around town, so there is no excuse really.  If you are up in the bustier ranges, skip this particular location.  They advertise that they go up to size 42DD, however, the selection is pathetic.  The young woman who was "helping" us, didn't even offer to measure my friend.  She just took my friend's word for the size.  Now, anyone who has ever shopped for a bra knows that different brands will fit differently - and this is supposed to be an upscale joint, right.  The girl who has "helping" my friend get going to answer the phone and was walking around with a phone to her ear while looking for bras.  Not classy.  Then, when my friend was trying on bras, she was off talking to another girl who was plopped on a seat in the back, apparently texting to pass the time.  I don't know if she was working, but she was not a pretty picture.  I finally intervened and ASKED THE BOZO CLERK to measure my friend.  We went from a 42 D to a 38 D - gee!  I finally gave up and just went in with my friend and helped her to fit her bra.  There used to be a magic bra fitter at Dillard's in Mesa who taught me everything about fitting a bra - and I thank her today for that.  The service was so low-rent.  It was not at all what I expected.  I have gotten more help at Wal-Mart for crying out loud.  The bra ended up costing 35 bucks - not unreasonable - in fact,  pretty darned inexpensive, as I was expecting more expensive wares.  But the whole experience was absolutely the pits.  I mentioned this location at my pilates class, and as it turned out, two other women had similar experiences.  One went out to Kirland Commons and said it was a much improved experience.  She, and I, would never waste our time at the Biltmore location.  We had to go over to the Hagen Daaz store and gaze at the chocolate to get over this disaster.

Get in your car and get to this place now!  All natural ingredients.  Calories posted by the flavor and none of the calorie counts will have you slinking away in shame.  You will strut out of there feeling proud of yourself for the excellent choice you have made.  Flavorful, handcrafted, creative.  Three bucks a pop (smirk...see what I did there ?).  If you are having a skinny day or you are naturally skinny (I may be jealous) you can get your pop dipped in chocolate and other good stuff for a pittance.  Buy 10 for 25 bucks.  Discounts!!!! Whoa.  Unbeatable value, awesome staff, samples, good AC.  I am in love...or did you miss that?

Still on soft opening, but still...The iced tea dispenser (manual) was out of order.  I ordered a Chronic Salad with the lime cilantro vinaigrette.  I got a handful of lettuce and some kind of nasty chicken....then I was asked if I wanted something else on it...huh?  So, I eyed a bunch of dispensers and asked for cilantro and onions.  All this for 7 bucks and change.  Ugh.  They serve beer.  A customer was in there eating a burrito.  She said it was good.  I will give this place a wide berth for a while.  I will wander over to Potbelly or Chick Fil A for my salads.  Both are a few steps away.  Oh...the t-shirts were cool.  They will be available at some point.
