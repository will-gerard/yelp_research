Decent food for the most part.  I went on a Saturday morning with an expectation of the place being overly crowded but surprisingly it wasn't. Great!! The downside is we sat for 15 mins without an acknowledgement...I was not pleased. Had we been served in a more courteous and timely manner my review may be higher because I did enjoy my food.  Great portions and very fresh. I would go again and possibly consider revising my review.

So if u are looking for a cheap pedicure this is the place to come.  They offer the bare minimum, which is fine, but they need more people working to perform the job...especially on a Friday after work.  The water temp for my pedi was tepid...TEPID!! Which in pedicure language is not a good thing. The manicurist was nice enough to turn on my massage chair but it was more annoying than relaxing. Very loud!!   I would recommend this place if you only have a few bucks and you HAVE to get a pedicure!

This is a mom and pop shop and the mom and pop who run this little operation are super nice!!.  They both came out to greet me, gave me a detailed analysis of what they are going to do and what the end result will be.  They have a coupon on their site for first timers and trust me, it came in handy.  Not because of the prices, which are very reasonable, but because I had so many items: a pair of suede boots and 4 pair of jeans that needed to be taken in. My total came up to $84...AWESOME!!  I highly recommend them.

The bartenders are the nicest people. I could hang out at the bar all night. DJ is awesome and the Lemon Drop martinis are the best in Scottsdale.  Simple but delicious food. I recommend the Las Brisas burger...so good.  Good for groups and a nice place to start your night before you hit the town.  Luckily we went on a night were the crowd was not out of control because this joint can get pretty busy and crowded.  You won't be disappointed.

One of the best spots to eat hands down.  I swear there is nothing bad on this menu.  Good for groups without the guilt on your waistline or your wallet.  No matter what I order, I have to set a side of the garlic potatoes...YUM!!

Honestly, this isn't the best chicken and waffles I have had.  I would rather go to Waffle House & Popeyes but then I would have to make two stops and who wants that.  Roscoe's has them beat hands down but since there isn't a Roscoe's here LoLo's will do.    There is a breakfast spot at the corner of 48th st & Indian School who offers better chicken and waffles if you have a craving.

Very good food!!  Great happy hour prices; small menu though.  A+ for ambience and food.  The menu prices are awesome and the staff is friendly.   The stars are for the menu prices for happy hour.  Roast beef slider $2, fries $4.    Can u tell I am about the cost?   The outside patio is nice on these chilly winter nights and also good for groups.

Loves this place for its laid back vibe.  The DJ is good because he plays just the right songs for the mood and spot. The makeover did wonders for this place.  The drinks are good and it's never very crowded, which if you are the owner is a bad thing, but for me it is perfect.  Great for friends or a laid back date.
