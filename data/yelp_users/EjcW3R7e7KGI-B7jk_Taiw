Very friendly and informative staff that really do care about the well being of your pet and not as much about the amount of money coming out of your pocket. The doctor recommended watching the sores rather than trying to pressure us into getting an expensive skin sample right away. I really respect that because she had an idea of what it might be and said, "let's watch it" when I am normally use to "we need skin samples and that will be $200 please and thank you.

I would not recommend coming to this office. I came in mainly because of tooth pain, my entire mouth was hurting and I wanted to find out what was going on. They scheduled me for an appointment, but they only had time to do x-rays. The doctor sat down for all of 2 minutes to look in my mouth and had zero answers or solutions to my mouth hurting, then sent me on my way. Not only was I upset leaving without any insight on my issue but the entire interaction with the doctor was very uncomfortable. Before I left, I met with the finance lady to pay up for my xrays and she was incredibly rude and snotty. EVERYONE hates the dentist, except me. Although, this experience made me not want to go back to hope they might give me answers for my mouth hurting and finish up my appointment.   I called the office manager and explained my situation and she cancelled my second appointment and forwarded my x-rays (that I paid for during my first visit) to the new office I decided to go to. Weeks later I received a bill in the mail. Called several times to try to figure out what it was for. When I finally got through they gave me a false answer, which I discovered after speaking to my insurance. I called, emailed and left messages numerous times and the office manager would not return my calls or emails. So with out response, I wasn't going to pay the bill if they weren't going to answer me. Hoping that once the bill was pass due they would actually call me back. Instead, sent me to collections. After two months of still trying to get a hold of someone who would talk to me at Open Wide, talking to my insurance and being harassed by the stupid collection company, I just gave up and paid the bill. Poor business practice and terrible customer service.   Go here if you are looking to be treated like garbage and pay for a doctor to look in your mouth, charge you and give you zero answers. Central Valley Dentistry is just down the street on 7th St and are much more thorough, respectful and the staff is awesome.

Ashley B. has nailed it right on the head. Check out her review and she says it all. On top of the rude and degrading employees, really $13 for a day pass? The average person probably lasts about 2 hours (at most) at the rock gym. And that price is if you have gear.... $18 if you don't....UGHHHHHH

I came to Central Valley Dentistry because I had a bad experience at another local dentist office down the street. They have been everything and more from what I am use to from my childhood dentist. They are friendly, welcoming and give you all the answers you need when asked. Dr. Behbahani is a great guy, very funny and friendly. Candace, the dental assistance I have seen both times I have been there, is really great too! She is personable, really helpful and so nice. I sent my husband here after my first great experience and we have been going here for almost a year and a half. Honest and helpful service is everything you could ask for in a dentist. Thanks Central Valley Dentistry for being awesome! I would recommend you every time!

Just celebrated a friends birthday party here and it was a great time! Amanda was our art teacher for our private party! She was really fun, corky :) and very helpful! I really enjoyed it! Have never painted like that before, on a canvas with someone taking you step by step. Very cool! The paint, brushes and canvas were provided and it was BYOW. I love the concept and will definitely go back again to paint something new!

Really great breakfast! And equally important, the service (all off the employees) were so nice and helpful! I had the b.m.o.c. and my husband had the biscuits and gravy. We both got coffee and a cinnamon roll to go. Very satisfying meal and experience!   We will definitely be back!

The Açaí Bowls here are excellent!! I had the Vortex Bowl and added coconut oil to it. The combination of the smooth frozen blend and the crunch of the hardened coconut oil and granola.... MMMMmmmmm!! So tasty!! Love the store too, so quaint and cute :) I will be back again and again!!
