They had exactly what I need, they were helpful, and cheaper than Leslie's down the street. I'm going to go here whenever I can.

From the get go, Marty was great. Very knowledgable and passionate about what he does. He recommends what he feels is best, not what will make him the most money. He finished the job quickly and it looks clean, as promised. Definitely recommended.

This is not your typical suit store.    A guy named Barry runs this place and he is definitely a character.  He'll let you know what looks good and what doesn't.  He won't necessarily cater to you just to make a sale, which I respect.  Don't get me wrong, he was extremely pleasant while I was there and I had a great experience.  In fact, I didn't even realize that I'd spent an hour just looking around the small store because he was like an entertainer.     You SHOULD go if: You have an idea of what you want. You're flexible with what you want.  You're looking for a low price.  You should NOT go if: You don't want someone offering suggestions.  You can't roll with a few lighthearted punches.  You get jealous easily (he was harmlessly complimenting on another customers lady-friend throughout their purchase).  Going forward, Men's Apparel Club will be my first stop when I'm looking for a suit.  Also, I'm not a serial Yelper.  As a matter of fact, I went through the trouble of resetting my password just so that I could leave this review.

The one star is for a change of gate hours. I scheduled a moving company (who charges by the hour) for 8am. When I showed up, there was a sign taped to the gate that said something along the lines of "gate will only be open during office hours," which started at 930.   Hours were changed without any advanced notice and it left me screwed with my moving company waiting.   Aside from that, this neighborhood is rough and there have been sketchy folks every single time I've been there. I don't feel comfortable sending my wife there alone. I highly recommend finding a different place to store your stuff.   I'll update this post if something changes.

All I can do is echo what everyone else has already said.  This is a one man band, but that one man (Matthew) knows his stuff.  Probably the best haircut I've ever received (and it was only $20).  I was trying out a few places around Phoenix but the search is over for me.  The only drawback is that you're going to see him, and only him.  There will probably be a wait so don't go when you're on a time crunch.  However, the finished product makes it well worth it.  He's very quick and always has a good movie playing so you probably won't mind hanging out.  I can't recommend this place enough.  If you're looking for a barber, go here.

I love this place.  Food, atmosphere, location and staff are all great.  I regularly get either the sunny breakfast burrito, a massive pop tart or the banana bread.  The coffee (from Cartel, I believe) is always good as well.    I head here whenever I can find an excuse.

I'm paying for 100mbs internet speeds and I'm consistently getting 3mps and under when I test it.   I don't think it'd be possible for cox to care any less about their customers.

I wish I could add another star!  Alex came out and went above and beyond expectations. He was quick to arrive and very thorough in his work. He did a great job and we highly recommend Arc. Next time we have electrical issues, I know who I'll be calling.

I'd heard nothing but good things about Barrio on 16th so I figured this place would be a safe bet.  I've eaten here three times and that'll probably be it for me.  Ambiance: The indoor portion of the restaurant is nice and decorated well with some beautiful paintings.  The outdoor area is basically shared with yard, which is cool.  Service: In the three trips I've made here I don't think I've seen the hostess smile once.  Wait time for someone to take an order and wait time for food were both too long on both occasions (I met friends there mid-meal on my second trip).  This last visit we (group of 5) we're waiting for our food for about 35 minutes and the restaurant was barely half full.  Water glasses sat empty for a while as well.  Food: I ordered the huevos rancheros on my first visit and I was underwhelmed.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but the portion size left me far from full.  The dish itself wasn't particularly flavorful in my opinion.  Maybe it's just my underdeveloped palate, but I was craving some 'bertos afterward to satiate my Mexican food craving.    On my second visit I got the chorizo and egg burrito a shot.  The chorizo was tasty but it was literally just egg and chorizo.  Some cheese, guac or sour cream would have gone a long way.  Again, this is purely subjective but it wasn't all that enjoyable for me.  On this last visit I got the torrejas (French toast, basically) and it was pretty good.  Serving size was more than adequate and the jalapeno bacon that came with it was great.  I did, however, have to ask for syrup twice.    I can say that neither myself or anyone I've eaten with has ever been disappointed with their drinks. The muelas (SP?) are their version of a Moscow mule made with tequila and they're great.  I really wanted this place to be good but I just didn't enjoy my meals there enough to want to go back.

Fresh, great tasting food and coffee.  Friendly staff. This place is a great addition to the area.

Clean shop, good prices, friendly staff, and most importantly, good cuts. I usually go to Barber Parlor and despite the great service there, it can be inconvenient (no appointments, closed on weekends, cash only).  Roosevelt barber shop just makes it easier. Definitely recommended.
