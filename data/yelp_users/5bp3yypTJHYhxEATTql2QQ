My oldest daughter and I are trying a different sushi place every month Moto at 16th and Bethany was our first.  It's a pretty busy corner with the sprouts and Mcdonalds but parking wasn't an issue.  We were seated pretty quickly as there was no waiting for a patio seat.  Everyplace we go we will order the California roll and tootsie roll.  The California roll tasted so fresh I was actually surprised. It was very tasty and we both loved it.  The tootsie roll was also very good. The eel aside was very sweet and tasty. I had a hard time tasting the fish in the tootsie roll but I enjoyed it nonetheless. We used the low sodium soy sauce and that was rather salty the wasabi was fresh as was the ginger.  We give it 4 fish heads out of 5

Family owned business. Good pizza, good specials, decent menu. I personally like the pizza and wing special.

I was in a car accident about 8 months prior and was still having pain. My primary care doctor sent me to this guy for a thorough exam, X-ray, consultation, etc.    This guy likes to brag how he's so well trained and knowledgeable. He might be. But all I got from him was "It's in your head, get on with your life". When I tried to explain that the pain happened in very specific situations, he said "Your X-rays are fine. Get over it and get on with your life."  Long story short, I ended up at A DIFFERENT doctor who listened to my concerns, explained what likely happened in the accident, why I was still having pain, what to expect going forward, and suggestions for follow up care.   I would never, ever recommend this doctor nor would I go there again..and I live walking distance from his office. He was so dismissive of my concerns, arrogant, and truly seemed like he had more important things to do than help me.   The actual office was very nice though. Zero stars for the "doctor" but one for the nice office.

Great pizza good food. dinner service is fabulous with great wait staff. Lunch is good to the only negative is the charge for refills. But that doesn't stop me from coming back

Had a carne asada chimi I found it dry without a lot of favor.  Chips and salsa good I'll try something else on the menu before writing off

I used to come here all the time when I worked nearby.  Well I am back and nothing has changed but the menu.  They still gave my favorite gyro platter for lunch special.  I had the gyro sandwich it was very good VERY good.  Went back a few days later for the Gyro Platter and its exactly how i remember it.  Going back next weekend or the one after with the family to see how good it is for bringing Children

Growing up in Detroit's I would go to a Coney Island a few times a month. Having lived in Arizona for 20 years I've never been able to find an authentic Coney Island hot dog until yesterday. Both my wife and I said after taking our first few bites this is exactly how I remember it. Hot dog, the chili, the atmosphere it's like being in downtown Detroit all over again

Came for the first time tonight on Carolyn and my quest to try more sushi places.  This place exceeded my expectations.  We had California roll. Spicy crab roll and caterpillar roll and the special of the day, which is not something regular on the menu. Carolyn thought this place was amazing. Rachel liked it too. Definitely going back!!
