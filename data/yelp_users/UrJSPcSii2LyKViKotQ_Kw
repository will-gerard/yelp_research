I came here for breakfast a couple times and I like it :). The salsa that comes with their chips is spicy :). Finally a place with a salsa that is spicy enough !!!  There is another good Mexican place nearby called Caroline but that's mostly a take out place that u want to order and pick up.  This place is more of a sit down restaurant with great service and good food.  It's only drawback is it's pretty obscure and in a bad part of town, otherwise definitely worth a visit :)

Okay this is a noodle bar.  Come here for noodles, and i mean all kinds of noodles, not just the japanese kind.  I say this because their korean Jambon is one of the better ones in the valley, even confirmed by my korean friends.  I think the soup noodles, soba, ramen and all are decent, but U shd all try the japanese fusion pasta dishes.  Yes pasta is noodles too :)  I especially liked the spinach noodles with chicken in alfredo sauce.  Trust me cause I am not a big fan of creamy alfredo, but theirs is balanced without too much of the cheesy taste of alfredo and the spinach pasta was cooked closed to "perfection",  yes its that good the day I went as the spinach noodles was just right, a little past al dente but not too soft and not too hard.  I don't know about the sushi, but unless someone tells me they make a good sushi roll, I will not try it at a place thats called a noodle cafe :)    I also had a plum sake kind of cocktail.  Very good, very strong, even though it was a small cup.  My friend had the rootbeer float sake cocktail.  That one's worse and he feels the effects almost immediately.  Nonethless. Service is good. Price is decent.  Food is very good.  Definitely coming back.  Oh, this place is kind of small, so seating is tight, thus if you come in a big group, try and call ahead or get ready for a wait.  I know this place is famous for 30 mins to 1 hour wait, so don't be too surprised if you have to wait a while :)

Great place for a quiet evening with friends.  good wine and unpricy selections.  we were hungry and gotten the half soup and sandwich combos which were all good and nicely prepared.  the portions are not too tiny too.  I like the ambience here very much and it reminds me of how kazmeriz in downtown scottsdale used to be, before it got famous.  so dun swamp this place with your wannabe friends :)  bring nice people okay :)

Four stars for this wonderful little hole in the wall kind of place.  The location is a little out of the way and I came in for lunch which is okay as there is a very varied crowd.  From longsleeved office workers to utility company uniformed types to gold chained and tatooed tough looking chaps, this place has it all.  Fret not because everyone's here for the good food :).   I had a machaca plate and I like it very much.  The beef was nicely cooked, juicy and tender and full of juices.  The tortillas are home made and very elastic.  Yes elastic, cause u can pull on it and it will stretch, it's almost a little rubber band like.  Unlike most tortillas at other places that simply tears off and crumb when u pull on them, this one will flex with your pull :)  I will be back for sure, can't wait to try their green chili burro :)

One of my fave places to come to for Breakfast.  Bring folks from out of town here and try their different creations and omelettes :)  There are a lot of other great reviews posted so read them and go eat :)

I had the pollo fundido here, it was pretty good.  I think you would like this place if you are someone who's not afraid of cheese and a little grease to go with that.  Its Sonoran style so U should know that there is gonna be a bit of cheese thrown in.  As for the grease, it comes from all the frying : )    They have pretty decent salsa and chips, but I guess the bean dip does not come standard any more because I did not see them serve that with the chips.  Maybe you got to ask for it.  Food alone should give this place 4-5 stars but the service was a little underpar.  Its not that bad, but certainly was just sufficient without any attempts to improve.  The host was in the midst of seating me but stopped to address an issue with the kitchen on a phone order.  I guess its not a big deal as the bus boys were really fast and would bring u, the salsa and chips and greet u warmly.    As for my server, well I guess she would be a 7/10 service-wise.  Passable but not exceeding anything.  She was in a hurry to put her order in and I noticed her doing the same thing to other customers too.  When the table next to me asked what kind of meat was in their chilli rellenos, she just replied, there is no meat in the chilli rellenos, without any explanation of what it was and if there is an alternative.  The customer got convinced into ordering a pollo fundido which according to the waitress was the same as a chilli rellenos but with a chicken (not really !).    In her defense, she was not rude or uncaring, just very order-oriented and focused on fulfilling them.  She would go around and ask if everything was okay with her charges and did ask if I needed a refill on my ice teas.  I guess its better than a server who would not come around at all, that would be worse.  So perhaps you would want to view the menu online first, using the link on this page and then read about what they were, so you can ask "educated" questions about the foods or know right up front what you want, so they can bring you something nice and hot to eat real fast :)  I would come back again if I am craving a nice cheesy (in a good way) meal.  Also the view is pretty good, its overlooking a little lake that it shares a view with Coffee Rush.

if you are looking for fine dinning italian and like speciality pizzas or creation, this place would prob be just a 3.  if however you are looking for a good italian place to have a pizza, a calzone or some nicely cooked wings, this is the place for you.  They have giant calzones.  come for lunch for their lunch special, a two toppings of you choice calzone and a drink for like 6.25 :)    Had their pizza and its pretty good too, it does not taste like a chain pizza like dominos and papa johns.  freshly made with good ingredients so its hard to mess it up :)  if you come here expecting olive garden, u will be pleasantly suprised.  if you come here expecting chain store food, u will be impressed.  I think because they get so crowded at lunch, it kind of makes it impossible for them to keep food and reuse them/ reheat it, and the ingredients will always be fresh and not sitting in the fridge for so long.  so, dun expect this to be a palce to move to chandler to, its not that great, but its very good enough to make your choice to move to chandler bearable and adds variety to your choice of places to eat over in the chandler area.

I don't like to write bad reviews but this place managed to get from really good to just average to now being pretty bad.   I am giving them one star as the curry chicken is still passable, its a lot more bland and watery now. else It will be 0 star.  My friend ordered and picked up our orders.  She had the terriyaki chicken and she said its watery now and it seems the taste is off.  I tasted a few pieces and the sauce is indeed very different.  Its watery and sweet and seems like something you buy in a bottle at lee lee.  FAIL, they used to claim they make the best teriyaki chicken back when the old man was here, but now I guess U can make the best teriyaki chicken at home, since it's a generic tasting sauce :)  I ran into the old man that used to work here last week and his wife at lee lee's, they confirmed that they no longer work there and, whoever is writing about them being there is probably posting it in the hopes that, those who really loved his service would go back and give it a shot in the hopes of running into him.  Don't waste your time if u are hoping to do that as I think the old man and his wife frequent the fry's across the street or lee lee's more often.  If I see him again I will tell him everyone misses him and if possible get a number from him.  He is doing very well and enjoying his time off after being let go off by the new owners.   He is not interested in finding a new job for the moment as he is headed to Malaysia for a holiday in February. He is healthy and happy and glad we all remember him.  I did not have a chance to chat long with him as another former customer saw them and came over to give him a hug and chat with them.  anyway, back to this place, I guess its time for me to move on to trying the food at red dragon or simply going north to aloha kitchen.  too bad this place used to be cheap and good but now I guess its just cheap.

Okay 5 stars because they are the alternative to Filibertos style food, without the Filibertos taste.  Its pretty clean and they have a nice salsa bar.  Menu is a little cluttered but they have many combos and different types of items.  If you are lost, order a carne asada burrito.  if u dun like guacamole, order a green chili burrito (pork with green sauce)  real good.  what else do i like about this place, price wise, its very comparable to most fast food and mexican fast food places.  U order at the front, pay and get your own food and drinks and bus the trays after.    its also 24 hours, so whats not to like ?

What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.    Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and "old" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)

this is the best thai food place in the valley.  period.  other kitchens come here to learn and guess their food contents and how to cook it.  trust me, i been to sawadee, thai rama, the old char thai, malee, yuphas, thai paradise.  if u talk to the owner, he can tell u that sawadee's owner and chef started coming the longest, thus their food come in as number 2 behind this place.  the rest are still trying.  if u want noodles, order this "kim-mao" or tell the owner, drunken noodles.  its not on the menu but its very good.  oh, it can be quite spicy, so if u dun like it too hot, let them know.   An alternative for the noodles will be pad see yew, which is also rice noodles, but this one with dark sweet soy sauce.  i dun need to tell u abt their good curries, just order them and try them.  do order their pork with mint leaves.  its got an interesting flavor and very tasty :)

very excellent salsa that comes with your chips :)  food is very good, very traditional mexican place without any of those fancy gorditas or cornitas or whatever they try to put together at taco hell !   i will keep this short as others have more details and everytime I am here, its a good experienc- food wise.  Customer service is decent too, they are not very fast at seating you, but I guess if you have an endless crowd at the door, it tends to tire out the servers too.  they do try to bring the food out as soon as u ordered, thats for sure.

Great service, delicious food, and the price is really not as expensive as the restaurant appears.  Very nice looking restaurant in an mostly office building area.  As you step in, you are greeted warmly and professionally by the staff.  The decor is very nice and classy, and not overly pretentious.    There is a nice variety on their menu to please everyone.  Well maybe not everyone, I did not see if they had a good vegetarian selection but pretty much a good place to bring friends who dun eat certain meats, like beef or seafood.  I had their RF Mixed Grill, which I highly recommend to anyone.  It gives u a sampling of all that is good at this place.  U really cannot disapprove of baby back ribs, chicken, shrimp and sausage.  all nicely cooked in a wood fired grill.  And all for only 24 bucks.  thats actually very comparable to a dinner at many chain restaurants, like outback steakhouse or even olive garden but without the tackiness and crowd you find at a chain restaurant.  We had a big group and everybody loved what they had, be it the buttermilk fried chicken, pork carnitas, or dr pepper baby back.  All were good and everyone were happy.  For appetiziers we had the really well cooked green chilli pork and, amazingly lamb chops and fondue.  I never knew fondue could be this good with lamb chops.  U would think an overwhelming combination as one is rich and the other oily, but it was really a tasty combo.  I think folks who come here expecting mastro would be genuinely impressed with the excellent service and relatively lower price.  Definitely a place to come to for a change if you are someone who is bored of chains like outback or olive garden or buca di beppo.

Don't let the appearance of this place fool you, they may be part of a grocery store, but they make good stuff.  they have a good chicken sherwama, that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  A good appetizer would be the dormades (rice wrapped in grape leaves), followed by the chicken sherwama plate and a cup of their nice and thick turkish coffee.  The plates comes with a generous serving of taboili, hummus, rice and meat.  For the price, its definitely worth a visit.  Can be crowded during lunch times.

Suzie's a great place for their lunch specials, they have good posole and beef tacos, and I remember they only cost like 6-7 bucks for lunch, throw in a 1 penny beer and you are ready to go back to the office a happy man.  Like someone else posted, you have to know what to expect.  Think a nice sit down Filibertos with bigger variety and a little more food.  and yup, the food's gonna be a little oily, but their salsa is nice and spicy :)  My buddy from El Paso loves this place cause he says the food is pretty authentic, like what his grandma would make when he is home.

Great Calzones, good pizza selections.  Their ambience is nothing to shout about if you are eating there.  But I am more concerned about taste so its fine, we sat in their back area when they had renovations once.  Its like U are seated on the other side of the false wall partitions and you see the cement floor, overhead wirings, wirings and pipes in the wall.  But hey, the food is all that matters, and they have decent servers who try hard to take good care of you.  Prices are also very decent due to their location being in the middle of an entire office and warehouse building zone.  My old office was just next door and my mechanic is in the same complex.  They get busy at lunch time with a lot of pick up orders and walk in for lunch from the nearby businesses.  If you are in the Tempe Marketplace area and need a good pizza and you have been to Slices over there and wanna try something different, this is the place.

I think its best to come here with an open mind because its not really a full fledge, hot butter-melty flakey crossaint place.  I don't recall how flaky the croissants are to be honest because I was too busy checking out the list of fillings they have inside their croissants.  Also they make a bunch of other snacks that are pretty good too.  Check out their website for the full listing of fillings they have inside their croissants.  Its a very long list and should fulfill anyone's desire of a peanut butter or even butter scotch croissant.    Oh ehh, i know its kind of weird at first because U can't quite place it.  The choices of flavors reminds me of selections normally found at a donut store.  Yet the appearance of the crossaints are between a bagel and a english muffin.  But hey, eat it and enjoy it :)  I had their breakfast sandwich kind of thing and its decent, tried their sweet croissant and it made me smile.  So come here if u like donuts, but wanna try something a little different, come here if u want to seek out a nicely made breakfast sandwich vs the typical microwave ones, and come here if u want breakfast on the go :)   I support the guts the owner has in pursuing this very interesting take on croissants and I shall be back again :)

i like tott's.  they make good food and have a fairly interesting menu.  Its like Pei Wei, but with a couple more options :)  I especially like their off menu item, the fried salty chicken :)  very yum.  Some of their items might be a tad dry with not a lot of sauce, but if u ask for extra sauce for it, they will be happy to oblige u.

This is the place to be if you shoot a bow.  Especially true if its a recurve you shoot.  Everyone here, staff, coaches, staff shooters are extremely helpful and happy to answer any questions you have.  Don't waste time going to the other hunting shops to ask about recurves, they will tell you the wrong answers and put compound parts on your recurves.  Its not fun and its always a waste of money.  Come here and Rhonda and her team of staff and coaches will do everything for you.  From ordering a bow, recommending options, listening to your inputs, to following up with you with updates on expected bow arrivals.  When the bow and parts arrive, come in for about 1 and 1/2 hours for them to set it up for you.  Every little detail is looked into, alignment of your plunger/sights/arrow rest/nocking point/ draw length.   I have been to several other places to try and get a recurve put together but, its very disheartening when you staff is not as current or not as informed about the types of risers and limbs as yourself.  When you come here, you will not have such problems.  Oh, don't get me wrong about this being a recurve place.  Far from it, a lot of hunters and a lot of compound shooters come here to get their bows tuned, arrows, accessories.  They help compound shooters adjust and tune their bow settings, recommend the right kind of arrows for them, help them figure out why their arrows curve a certain way, set them up with different kinds of compound targets for their practices.   Oh did i mention accessories.  They have everything you need....................everything. if they don't have it in stock, u can be sure they can order it for you.  I have seen people here with their 4th or 5th bow, and they will talk fondly about their first bow which they had gotten here too.  You will see parents with their own bow shooting alongside their kids in the shooting ranges.  This is the place to be when you have decided you are going to try out or get into archery/

This place has great breakfast, with a menu thats not too big and complicated and some pretty nice creations of their own.  The bread they have is unique for sure, duh, its called a bread company :).    I shall thus point your attention to their omelettes and other creations.which is though not as full as Crackers Cafe down the road, nor overloaded like the good egg or us egg, it does have a certain amount of creativity and uniqueness.  For example, do the az omelette which has a nice creamy hollandise like sauce over the omelette.  Else do the carne adovada, :)  no elaboration needed with a name like carne adovada.  I am gonna go out on a limb here and assume their lunches and breakfast sandwiches are equally good.  I don't know cause I have only been here twice for breakfast and twice I like the casual atmosphere, friendly staff, good breakfast that has not disappointed and overall feel of the place.    Come here and U will like it :) Its not everyday that I find a spot as good as Crackers and Co :)

This is a good asian place, if you know what to expect.  Think a mix of Panda express prices with HK style coffeeshops.  If you expect un-oily food, better to look elsewhere.  Its Cantonese cruisine, fried with a wok and oil, definitely a little greasy.  I think they have decent american chinese food, like kung pao chicken, chow mien, terriyaki chicken bowl.  But what makes they stand out would be their huge menu of cantonese and asian food.    The owners are adventurous and would try making dishes from other countries other than HK, like they have their take on Hainanese Chicken Rice found commonly in Singapore and Malaysia.    I don't feel the quality of the food was compromised in anyway due to their lower price.   But due to their huge menu and having a large crowd, sometimes the standard varies a little.  Also, when the owner Michael is not cooking, sometimes his assistant makes a little different tasting dish.  I do recommend what I know.  Instead of Terriyaki Chicken, try their Curry Chicken Meat Rice, Instead of Mongolian Beef, try their Xo sauce Beef or if you dare to Bittermelon with Beef over rice.  Instead of Chow Mien, try their Beef Chow Fun.  Instead of Orange Chicken, try their HK style Sweet and Sour Pork.  Instead of a couple of meat dishes, try their Hong Kong style Grill, where U can order like 2 meats and they give u a soup, rice or spaghetti all for like 7 bucks.

okay, come here for their tofu soups.  best one in the valley if u like them hot and thick and spicy.  a plus too that they serve their rice in a hot stone pot separately.  i won't come here for their korean bbq as its good but there are 2 other places i know that does better.  but their tofu soup and their other soup items are all very good to excellent.   but dun get me wrong, i am not saying i won't eat or order their korean bbq, but just that its not their strong point, but if we come in a group, for sure we will order it along with some tofu soup for sharing too.

I like this place.  Don't come expecting like Filiberto's or an authentic Mexican place.  Instead think of this as a mix in between Baja Fresh and Filiberto's.  The owners and cook make their meat as authentic and Mexican as they can, but they would make very interesting  creations, in addition to the regular beef burrito.   Its like what Pita Jungle did with Gyros and Arabic food.  This is their more modern and adventurous take on good Mexican food.  Its a pretty well kept secret because I see the crowd that comes here are people who live around this place who comes in after a run or hike, and people who drive around for work kind, delivery guys, AAA vehicle guys, construction vehicles.  I don't think they use Yelp thus, only 2 reviews so far.  Check it out, you will be pleasantly suprised.

Great cupcakes, five stars for their creative designs and five stars for their super patient and understanding stuff who  took the trouble to digress the various ingredients and flavors in each cupcake.  I will be back again to get my next half doZen :) yum yum bring a friend to split a cupcake as they are pretty big.

wings place.  good wings, sports on tv.  i like the spicy flavors.  not so much the parmesan ones, they taste a little too funky :)  the staff that works here are pretty good and they will be happy to remind you that you are ordering boneless or with bone combos, just so you won't feel cheated when the bones are missing or are in there :)

Like Pho Nat in Tempe, this place used to be in business because of their convenient location, next to Lee Lee.    As of some time middle of last year, I guess either there is a new boss or chef, but right now this is my go to place for Vietnamese Pho if I am in Chandler area.  Used to be Saigon down the road but that place is not consistent with their pho taste and portion, also they have too much msg-like things in them that you know is msg, cause U are swallowing gallons of water after U finish a bowl of pho at Saigon.  Okay back to this place, back when we were students and before Mekong open, Lee Lee is a weekend carpool thing with friends for groceries and then maybe some asian food.  So I am sure this is the same for any poor student that don't drive or drive a student car, your options are pretty limited, and you will have made the mistake of visiting Pho 68 like 3-5 years ago or earlier.  Chances are you will not go back again because the soup is bland, artifically sweet due to a lot of msg and the color of cloudy water with a few slices of meat.    But like I mentioned, as of last year, a friend tipped us off on the change in chef or boss there and the pho is very good.  so, we trust our friend and she was right :)  She may not be vietnamese but she is in the food industry and shes right that it has come 180 from before.  So come here and order the Pho, with spring rolls and an ice coffee.  U will like it, your stomach will thank u for it and when you are done, go thru the sidedoor to lee lee and go buy some groceries that are foreign and whose name you cannot pronounce, but still are tempted to try anyway :)  Oh, the boss here is very laid back and friendly and will recognize u if he sees U for a second time that same week.  He is usually a one man operation and can be a little slow, but don't fret, its gonna get here, just keep your eyes on the tv in the middle and be confused at what they are singing about :)  Most of the soup noodles are pretty decent, I had tried several different ones, the regular pho, seafood broth ones, tomatoe broth one and the spicy hue style ones.  I don't know if the rice plates are good, but the spring rolls are decent too.    So if u are in chandler and craving pho, u know where to go :)  let me know if u know of any place better, i am always interested to try ;)

bad bad choice for sushi buffet.  sashimi was thick and limited, gyozas were drenched and not crispy at all tempura was okay sushi rolls had carrots in them, carrots, seriously............ rice in sushi rolls keep breaking and coming apart, pack them full or rice and have a hard carrot piece in there and just a little bit of fish service was terrible, other than the ice tea and water refills, our server messed up our order each time we put it in.  first time, only half the sushi came out so we re-ordered, took 20-30 mins for reorder to come, again, missing several rolls, did a 3rd reorder, another 20-30 mins.  we were there for 3 hrs.  3 terrible hours, i kid u not, we will never go back here again. i rather they increased the price from 20 to 25 and give us a real decent  buffet like they used to, say about a year ago.  now its just really bad. staff were doing their best to mess up or ignore us.

Maybe when they opened in 2009, they had better service but this place is pretty close to horrible.  I am pretty easy going, and would come back to most places but this place is a one time thing.  Too many complains that are similar to others who have 1 or 2 stars.  Read theirs, its very similar to my experience there.  The 2 stars is purely for the decent quality of their meats and sides (except the macaroni salad which taste of pure mayo).  No stars for layout/appearance/settings, no star for unfriendly and rude customer service.  No stars for being cheapskates and posting signs asking for 25 cents for to go boxes, one refill each or they will charge u if they catch U.  Use the water cups for soda and they will "catch you and charge U the full price", and oh also no Restrooms.  Not even for customers.  I wonder who they bribed at the City of Tempe to get away with this.    My own experience goes like this, stood at the counter after looking thru the menu at the side.  Was the only one there except for another customer who is sitting and talking with the cashier.  Cashier reluctantly comes over and take my order.  Told me to pick 4 sides, half way thru scooping my mac salad, turns away and disappears to the back.  Comes back and ignored me, went to the microwave and pulled out a plate of food.  Grab chopsticks and a napkin and brought it out for the customer she was busy chatting with (probably a regular)  Realized that I am still here (its hard to miss a 6-1 fella standing behind your damn counter)  and came back to get me the rest of my sides.  What is wrong with that previous paragraph................Microwave.  other than bad service which I have already expected, i guess they have meat and stuff ready grilled and just popped them with the sides all on a plate into the microwave.    The Kalbi ribs were decent, some sections had too much fat, use a better grade of meat to prevent this.  chicken terriyaki is good.  Meat Jun is disgusting.  Sorry whoever had it, might have had the fresh ones, mine is stale cold and microwaved, I know it because anything with egg when left for too long will start to leech oil and turn a darkish yellow color.  They have a lot of food, yes, but their formula for success is just that, lot of food, lot of mediocre, cafeteria, mess hall type of food.  if you are hungry and need a lot of food and have no problems handling this, well, its all good, this is your place to come to.  I would have loved this place when i was in college, but wait, I had mai island Grill back when I was in ASU and they made really good BBQ for about the same price.  Don't be impressed by the sides because all Korean places in the valley give U these sides of 6-8 dishes with your lunch or dinner.  Their sides are nothing special and same as any Korean place.  if that is all someone need to beat them, then just make medicore food like they do, don't use a microwave or better yet just hide it from the front, give 5 sides with every order, charge the same price, give free refills, free to go shit and last but not least, service with a smile.  Open your restaurant down the road from this place and yup, maybe even call yourself the Real Paradise Grill :)  I think some of the people I usually see with great reviews on Yelp had probably came here in 2009 when it first opened but now, its lost its sense of pride in terms of appearance and food.  Its time for either an owner change or a restaurant change.  Last but not least, Sun Devils, come on, you need to pick with you feet and walk away from places that gives you bad food and service, I did, you can too.  get a george foreman grill, some korean bbq sauce, some beef short ribs, put them in a bag, pour in some bbq sauce and let it sit over night, next day just grill it.  Thats it, all the kalbi u like to eat.

Their pho is the worst I had in the az area.  with respect to the other rave review, their only saving grace is good service, esp for people who had not had vietnamese food before, as their servers do speak better english and because they are not crowded usually, they would have more time and patience to explain the food to you.    The reason why they are not crowded is because they are located in a vietnamese/asian centric mall with large crowds of asians shopping for food and groceries at the mekong supermarket, and they know a good pho from a bad one.  Trust me I am asian :)     Going here would be like a vegetarian going to texas roadhouse and having them cook up a steak and try to explain to you the fine art of grilling aged beef.    If you are at the Mekong plaza area, and U need some vietnamese food, go to the other vietnamese restaurant that is directly across from them, I can't recall the name, but they have a large menu full of rice dishes and stuff.  U can order like noodle items too, I love their dry house special noodles there.    If you are new to vietnamese food and would like an intro, I guess this place might work, so 1 star for that.  there are a lot of other places U can go to like Khai Hoang, Dat Vang or even Saigon.

I come here too often to write a unbiased review :)  It is good food, great service (80 percent of the time) and just a great place to bring friends, family, and out of town folks to.  I believe they would prefer the originality and creativity of the creations found here over a bunch of other chain breakfast places.  Especially their omelette creations, which can go anywhere from a classic denver omelette to the new princess.  Also check out their lunch sandwiches and burgers.  I had their chicken tortilla soup, and it was good.  I hear good things about their burgers too :)  if you got a sweet tooth, check out their bread pudding for dessert.  its moist and warm, and just so very tasty.  Read the other great reviews for more details, i need to focus on my food now.

It should really be a 3 and 1/2 star review but the 1/2 extra star is for the excellent customer service.  The reason for this was the burger I ordered was a little too charred.  I am not very fussy, but it actually tasted charred.  My friend ordered a chicken wrap which was very good, till he got to the second half and found that it was charred too.  Way too charred for him to eat, thus he had to send it back.  The saving grace of all this was that our server was really nice and did an excellent job from start to finish.  She kept refilling our tea, brought the orders out swiftly and kept coming back to check on us.  I noticed that the other servers were also doing that too for the other clients, thus they all deserve an extra star for it.  I think that because we had gone in right when they had just opened for lunch, the cook was probably multi-tasking while cooking our food.  A couple minutes too long and U get burnt burgers and wraps.  Otherwise, no complaints on the level of service, food presentation and taste or variety.  We will be back and hopefully next time they will not burn their patties and meat again.  Seems that is the only thing keeping them from another star for a lot of reviewers here.

Update :)  very happy to say that they did not mess up the food this time.  Nothing tasted burnt and everything was fresh.  I had their all u can eat fish, which is very good fresh fish.  I say that cause if U had left fried fish under a heat lamp for too long, they get very hard and dry.  The fish here were all nicely fried and hot, from the inside, fresh and not dry, but very supple to the touch.  Well done !  Service was again top notch like the first time :)  I am however glad that, this time, I am very happy to say they deserve a 4 to 4 and 1/2 stars for their excellent service and great food.  I always come during lunch so I can't try their beers, but if the food and service is any indication, this place should be definitely good to visit :)

2 stars, would have been 4 if the service was at least decent.  Hard to justify waiting 25 minutes before someone came and talk to us after we were seated.  We came here after hiking Picacho so we were too tired to leave but this is shamefully bad.  Food quality was actually pretty good, better than the Chandler's Mimi, but after the drinks came and food order was taken, it was another 25 minutes before the food came.    Refills were slow, the lady who helped us tried to smile and apologize but she was certainly quick to drop the check off when we barely finish eating.  So 25 mins wait for drinks order 25 mins wait for food order 30 mins to eat check was not late, came right as soon as she took the first few plates off.  Oh and we did not go during rush hour, we were there at 2pm.  All in, we got out of this place at 10 till 4.  Not impressed and kind of shocked that a national chain could be so bad.  If anyone from Mimi Corporate is reading, just send someone over there and pretend to be a late lunch client on Saturday, guaranteed a very full report.

Very nice and busy neighbourhood breakfast place.  Closest comparison I can think of for such a busy place would be Liberty Market in Gilbert.  I had the Corque Madame.  Its was well done with the right amount of cheese and ham and the fried egg was good.  I was a little disappointed that the only side it comes with was just a fruit cup, but then, what kind of sides do U give to a carb heavy sliced of bread anyway ?  I guess fruit is the best choice in this case.  I saw the Huevos Rancheros my friend ordered, he liked it very much too, the server even offered him a side of a spicier salsa when he asked if the sauce was gonna be spicy.  He does have one little query, why does it not come with beans ?  It comes with potatoes and a fruit cup too but we asked the server about it and he says, they usually don't serve beans with huevos rancheros.  But those are two small things that did not affect my overall experience by too much.  Because based on what they cooked and offered, the food was well made and very tasty.    I will definitely be back again because the coffee is really good (no longer cartel but also a local brand, expressions), service is excellent and food is well prepared.  I don't know what kind of service the other people here received but we had a very good server who kept coming back to refill our coffee.  I did see that the table next to us with a different server were visibly displeased when their server was too busy running around to refill their coffees often enough.  Also the server did come over and apologize to them, when we got our food before them, though we got in behind them.  I guess you can't control the kitchen and maybe the server was a little younger than our server, thus might have appeared a little more rushed, but I dun recall him being rude or away for too long.  Their coffee cups stayed half full most of the time still.  I will need to come back again to sample the other food choices, apparently they serve a good dinner too.  I guess it would be prudent to come earlier here on sunday for brunch as the farmer's market in the corner brings in a big walking crowd.  I imagine on saturday it would be pretty packed too.

Prices had increased a little, from when they first opened.  But the shakes and juice mixes are really fresh and tasty.  The guy behind the counter, the manager I think would make interesting concoctions, they made something called morning dew one afternoon, with like mint leaves and some other ingredients that was left to bake in the sun.  I had a slice of their really nice pomegranate chocolate cake and it made my day :)  Its next to Trader's Joe and is near the Ahwatukee area, so it attracts a nice variety of people, ranging from young sporty types, to family spillover from shopping from trader joe's, to groups of friends catching up.  I don't know how good the food is, but most of the people who came seem to like it.  I think if you are looking for a nice play to chill and have a cold refreshing juice or shake and catch up, this would be a nice place to go.

firstly, they get 2 stars cause of the good effort and the sincere service of the wait staff, who are obviously anime fans and like all things Japanese :) but seriously, very attentive and good service, only reasoin why i give them 2 stars  overpriced and very average broth.  For like 7 bucks u get 3 thin slices of "char-shiu" , some sprouts, some golden mushroom and decent amt of noodles.  But realy, its 2 bucks to add 3 more slices of char shiu ?  and like 1 dollar to add sprouts ?  come on, thats a rip off.    The only reason U go here is if u are too lazy to drive to somewhere better and really must have a hot bowl of ramen.  In this case I guess U can settle for this, but if U just want soup, go down to Khai Hoang on Apache and Mcclintock and U get much much better and more ingredients soupy broth noodles.  Dun go here for ramen if U can, go to like iKitchen or Sushi Ken, either one will top this place hands down.

Forget abt the earlier post abt their acceptable ramen.  Went there just a few days ago and its ramen is on par with republic ramen, equally bad.  Pls go to sushi Ken, that is really the only good place for good ramen.  order their spicy miso ramen there.  The ramen here is 3 thin pieces of pork and noodles and some "western" vegetables like cabbage and brocoli.  yes, its that bad.  if i wanted this kind of stuff, those packet ramen noodles would be better.

They have really nice hand pulled noodles, with various choices of soup broth, or sauce and ingredients based.  They make the noodles here themselves and it is its key ingredient.  I like their beef noodles soup which comes with broth and pieces of beef.  One complain which leads to their 4 star is the lack of pieces of meat.  Noodles aplenty but the condiments and meat are not enough.  I had only a few pieces of lamb with my lamb noodles soup.  Do order their combination appetizer plate which comes with pieces of cold cut meats.  Also, the wait is very long if u come on the weekends and during lunch time.  Remember to flag down a employee and get a number, its pretty chaotic with no one at the front, but U need a number so U can get a seat when they have one.  But I will be back, for sure, thanks to their good noodles and tasty broth.

Great food, great service, very interesting menu with many many choices.  Price was decent, only complain might be the place is a little too small and gets busy very quickly.  In fact, go there at opening time to get a seat and get served fast.  Keep up the good work of trying to introduce a new taste to the SW.

Really good neighborhood cafe for breakfast and brunches :)  I have been here like 4 times and each time, they had great service and good food.  In terms of creativity of the menu, this place beats Cracker Barrel but does not have as adventurous a menu as Crackers and Co Cafe, down the road.    The ambience is kind of like a comfortable neighbourhood eatery where u go to for dinner if you are too tired to cook.  Comfortable seats, lots of natural light thru their diner looking windows and a staff that will probably get to know your name after a few times.  Food wise, like what the other reviewers said, they make a mean biscuit.  I know, not everybody is a big fan of it, so get their pancakes instead.  They do put in some biscuit batter in it to give it a very different feeling.  But dun just go there for biscuits haha, other stuff like egg and sausage, are very standard breakfast stuff.  Do check out the portugese sausage instead of the regular ones, a lot more flavorful and a little spicy.  I also had lunch here before, they have a smoked chicken jalapeno alfredo.  I like it very much, its got a lot of chicken and quite a bit of cheese over it.  True the jalapeno does not make it spicy enough for my liking, but its fusion italian so I guess the jalapeno is to enhance its flavor and not dominate it.  Also jalapeno in az is not spicy, if you want spicy pasta, maybe ask them to add a pinch of habanero to the sauce to spice it up.  Its by far one of the best fusion pasta I have had before.  I know its not those fancy fusion food where u get two bites worth of food and U are still hungry and end up with a big check.  This is a pretty decent size plate which will keep you full and happy.  I hear they have an excellent fish fry too on Friday, but like others who reviewed it, they seem to close a little earlier.  But its fine, just go earlier if you really mean to eat there ! :)  or else just do brunch there on a lazy weekend, you will likely be satisfied.  Else let the owners know, they are usually at the counter or going around refilling coffee and asking if you enjoyed your meal and such.

I see a lot of complains abt their dim sum.  I think its cause of their opening hype and a new crew being unable to keep up with the opening day crowd ?  Nonethless, I am giving this place a 4 star for the food, not dim sum cause I have not tried it.  I have eaten inside the restaurant area and outside in the food court area.  Decent selection.  Good food.  Especially of note is their roast and bbq items, like bbq pork and roast pork.  Both are excellent and done right.  Trust me, if you go to Best HK or buy them from Lee Lee, they will give u fatty bbq pork sliced very roughly in huge chunk.  Its not the way that should be served as the taste of a giant chunk of pork is a little overpowering especially if you have the bbq sauce flavor.  My buddy who came to visit from Colorado loves their roast duck so much, he went there on the last 3 days of his visit.  His main complain was why I did not bring him there earlier in the week ?  So U know, come here expecting seafood well prepared ,wok dishes cantonese style, cantonese/hk style bbq and U will have a good meal.  I cannot vouch for their orange chicken or mongolian beef but if U want asian american food, there should be a good offering inside the mekong supermarket at the food court.  Inside the mekong supermarket yes.  This one is at the Mekong complex main food court.  don't go to the wrong place okay !

Trust me, I worked at a Chinese take out place before and this rice here is stale and day old, because fresh rice does not look off white and is not so hard.  Spring rolls when fried once are light brown in appearance, but refried ones that were not sold the day before, and thrown back into the deep fryer turns the edges dark brown and greasy.  Some folks might try to say the oil is just darker, but darker oil in the fryer means its not been cleaned and changed regularly enough that its gotten to a gunky black color.  It's a troublesome process and, it is true that most places do not do it often enough, but U have to do it before it starts to corrupt the taste and appearance of your food.  The chicken and broccoli I had was not great at all.  Its several small slices of chicken and broccoli that are coated with a thick black sauce.  Overly starched and overly salted.  Does not have any flavor at all.  If this is NY style Chinese food, then its not the NYC I have been to.  My friend had their teriyaki chicken and its bad too : (  Same stale rice with pieces of oversauced chicken.  He said after it tasted kind of weird, not the teriyaki taste he was expecting.  Again too much starch and salt.  And this is the dude that eats everything.   Dear fellow yelpers, stop short changing yourself.  Please stop accepting fresh vegetables as a criteria for being good Chinese food.  Neither does big shrimp, crisp cabbage in egg rolls, big pieces of meat qualify as criterias for good Chinese food.  Guys, U have to send me a message if you do not agree and I can give U a list of Chinese food places to go eat at where all of the above is a given and the decision lies in taste.  If your criteria is a lot of decent food for a good price, that's perfectly fine too, send me a message and I can point U in the right direction to a good Chinese buffet, seafood or no seafood.  But please do not rate this place as 5 stars because a 2 star is generous.  I gave them 2 cause the service is good and they keep the place pretty clean and neat.  I think I am too generous already.

Chopped salad, believe the hype :)  its very good.  I'm not vegetarian or a big salad eater but this salad is a great way to start your dinner, esp if shared.  Get the smoked salmon version okay.  What makes its special is the great mixture and variation in texture of the different ingredients.  And I am not a very selective palate eater and cannot usually detect any subtle differences, but this mixture of ingredients screams very soft, to soft to medium to medium hard to hard to crunchy.  Its very well balanced.  I had meatloaf and it was very good, the sauce they use to coat the meatloaf gravy is very good.  My friend had the scallops and it was cooked very well.  Just right, not over cooked and rubbery or undercooked and raw.  U may think its not a big deal but trust me, not a lot of restaurants can do it properly.  service here is top notch and everyone is very nice and polite.  the place is a little noisy and can get crowded which might make it a tad noisy to have conversation.  but its pretty good overall and I had a wonderful experience here.

First off, I am not from Pilly so if you are judging this place based on how great the subs are compared to Pat's or Gino's in Philly, I can't help you with that question.    However, this place is clean, staff are friendly, service is good, food is very good.  Definitely a great choice for lunch with their 6.49 for a cheesesteak of your choice, fries or chips and a drink. And don't restrict yourself to just regular cheesesteak with the yellow cheese, those are good, the ones here are very juicy and cheesy :)  But check out their other cheesesteaks, they have one with peppers which they pair with some semi-spicy peppers and white cheese.  Its a great combo as the white cheese does not overwhelm the taste of the peppers.  I have been here twice and had the regular and the pepper and both are very yummy.  Also, you will be surprised that they sell pretty decent pizza here.  Its not the dominos-full of tomato sauce below their cheese pizza, but actual decent ingredients you can see and taste and comment on their freshness.  We had a lady give us some pepperoni and sausage pizza slices to us the first time we went, not cause its no good, but because they were expecting a smaller pizza; and the large she ordered was too big for her and her son.  They too have a nice pizza deal, 5 dollars for a large pizza and every topping after it is just 1 dollar.  You really can't beat that.  Anyway, the pizza the lady gave us was cold but it still tasted very good and fresh, and not overflowing with the canned tomato sauce you find in most delivery pizza.  Last but not least, they deliver, so if you live around this area, good for u, I came here for lunch but I live in the other direction so I guess I will have to check out their other branch in tempe.  But really, come here for the fast friendly service and really decent cheesesteak.  Oh and don't get that weird tasting cheesesteak from subway, come here and get some of this, your tummy will thank you :)

Come here if you are   1. a sun devil 2. too young or too old to go to be at the breakfast club 3. want to go to the breakfast club but are too drunk to drive, walk please.  its located downtown, its crowded, its youthful, its noisy, its got decent food, creativity is decent, food taste pretty good.    u go up and order and pay, they bring the food to you.  the crew is energetic and would do their best to fight thru the crowd to bring your food to you, bring your sauces to you :)  U get your own drink, just be careful not to run over anyone thats hungover.  for old farts like me, this is quite a nice place because it captures some of the ASU campus spirit when you are here.  it kind of reminds U of the MU at lunch time (I am sure its still busy as hell now)  come here, order some coffee, eat an omelette, oh but bring a friend, so someone can watch the seats while the other go order.  its very crowded and mostly first come first serve.  try to limit your party to like 4 or 8 people or 12, u get the idea, the tables seat 4, so if worse come to worse, you can split up to 2-3 tables but still fit everyone in.

Excellent buffet with awesome variety.  I was here on a Tuesday night and it appears they had just opened.  The location looks very new with shiny new plates and silverwares.  The appearance and cleanliness of the place is very good, cause its new I guess.  The dinner buffet was $10.  which is pretty standard for a buffet dinner.  I was however not expecting anything special like oysters or stuff.    Suprisingly, its like a Pacific buffet, with a sushi bar, fresh oysters, variety of ice cream-green tea even, about 8 stations full of food.  Pacific only has about 5.  But this place have 8 stations full of different varieties.  I like that they have a very good mix of american and chinese american food.  From fried bananas to roast beef to broccoli beef to fried rice to string beans to a full salad bar and a full dessert bar, u name it, they got it.   But here's the kicker, I really like that they have a very fresh and clean mongolian grill area, where u go over and pick and mix your own plate of noodles and meat and they chef it up for u.  This place has noodles, beef, pork, shrimp, several vegetables and such.  But Their biggest surprise is, they have Ribeye steak.  Yes raw Ribeye steak right there for U to pick and place on your plate for them to stir fry along with your mix.  That was really impressive I thought, such a nice piece of meat that would have suffice as a main course itself at most dinner places, now U can add it to your grill plate and they would cook it any way u want it.  Its very far away from where I live but U can bet I will be looking out for other Hibachi Buffets.  I hear they have one on the I-17 and my buddy who lives in Mesa claims they got a new one opening out where he lives on Alma School and Southern.  I am not sure if they are all the same but U know I will be checking that branch out to confirm is the same chain :)  Meanwhile if U live in Peoria, U lucky Bastard !  Go there and fill yourself up for 10 bucks.     Oh, one little thing that did not mar my experience enough to give a lower rating, was there seems to be too many staff or maybe its cause they just opened, they were hanging around in groups and chatting and disappearing in groups to the back area to laugh and joke.  They were making a little too much noise and having a little too much fun, and not refilling my ice tea fast enough !  But, the manager came around a couple times to check on everybody, and that does help keep them on their toes a little bit.

One confession, I did not try every item on their menu, so this 5 stars is for Fried Chicken and excellent customer service.  I have brought lots of folks here after I tried their fried chicken and they all agree this is the best.  Forget about LoLo's or Mrs White.  Forget about Church's, Popeye's or even Louisana Fried Chicken.  They do not have the kind of crispy, crunchy on the outside, moist juicy on the inside that this place has.  The cook is the husband and the lady in front is his wife.  Sometimes their daughter takes orders too.  I like their service very much, they try to answer any questions you have and make very good suggestions on what to order.  In spite of being here many times, I have always ended up ordering fried chicken as I would bring someone new each time and we end up doing the 8 or 12 piece, and have not once been disappointed.  I do have to say that you might want to call ahead before you head over there and order.  even if you are eating in. :)  That is how their chicken taste so good, they do not have a heat lamp like you see at church's or kfc where the chicken gets dried up.  they only cook it when u order it :)  so don't give them a one star cause their food makes u wait and u get all angry and unhappy and have the bitter taste of bile in your mouth ruining your taste ;)  so enjoy it and check out their carrot cake, its not too sweet and very delicious and a good end to your meal of yum yum chicken !

A wonderful place to learn to dance. The weekly group classes are a good place to start. The size of the group classes are small enough to ensure u have the personal attention of the instructor.   I have attended group classes at other places, and this place is heads and shoulder above it. At those places, u are in a room full of like 30-40 people and U always end up having an unbalanced class ratio of guys to gals, so u might end up dancing the wrong steps many times, or end up standing around more than dancing.   The instuctors here, Maryanna and Carlos would dance with each student and also observe each of U when you dance, allowing for immediate corrections and guidance on making you a better dancer. At those other community classes, U'll be lucky if the instructor knows your name at the end of 6 weeks.  Definitely worth a visit and stopping by, you will not be disappointed.

Come Check out this place :)  Very decent food if you if you are looking for HK/asian style food.  I thik they are like Asian Cafe in mesa but with less asian variety for the moment.  They have the typical HK cafe kind of food, like wonton noodles, beef chow fun, duck lo mien, rice plates.  They also have the very typical dishes you can order in restaurants here like peking pork chop, walnut shrimp, singapore fried mei fun, various kinds of hot pot.  They also do some pretty interesting dishes, U can usually see those on their daily boards or special boards in addition to their menu.  Most of the dish ordering items are good for sharing.  if you are in a smaller group, definitely do their rice plates, or noodle soup or fried noodle items for individual  I have also tried their lunch special of mapo tofu, its americanized, but since its lunch special, thats understandable, still it was tasty and a decent size lunch portion for the price.  No complains there.  I don't judge a dish based on its cooking style, if its a good american chinese dish, it is a good american chinese dish.  Of course if you use the asian taste for mapo tofu, its gonna look like an utter fail due to the fried tofu and slightly sweet chilli sauce, but they are two different thing okay.  Do come here to try their unique dishes like chao chow duck and garlic shrimp.  I will get some chow fun and lo mein to go one evening and see if they do a good job with those ;)

Friendly staff and fast service, but if you are looking for Baja Fresh.,.......this is not it.  I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.  I guess the flavor is a little bland too but I did not notice it as I was trying to figure out how this place could be so crowded even when the meats are dry.    well the salsa and chips are decent, good spicy salsa.  Otherwise for 7-8 bucks for 3 subpar tacos, no thank you.  I have had better at a lot of places and also, if your tacos are leaking and falling apart, why don't you use 2 shells ?  I mean, it can't be that much.  I had 5 dollar plates at el rancho ranch market and they serve them that way and their meat was not dry.    Anyway, I guess the bright light, clean eating area, friendly staff makes up for subpar food for folks who want a quick lunch.  it is indeed america's taco shop if you are looking for an american taco, but heck I had better tacos at Dos Gringos and I'm pretty sure the chef was drinking too :)  Pls bring back Baja Fresh.

Probably for the moment, the best overall TW place in town. Its been so long we had to go without a semi-decent TW place.  They have a very nice menu and list of items.  From your typical beef noodles, to oyster omelette to rice rolls.  They have them here.  Also they have got stinky Tofu.  yes stinky tofu :)  Smells horrible but taste so good :)  Food overall is good, but U cannot compare this with Taiwan standard.  especially if you have friends who just came from TW, this will not be good enough to register as TW food.  but comparing this to what we have here in the valley, with the few TW places around, this place does a great job.  The service was brisk and they will try to bring you the orders quickly.  The location is a little hard to spot.  Just remember on the Southeast corner of Mill and Southern.  Look for the O'Reily's autopart store and its just directly east of it (away from the intersection).  Look for the restaurant with the big windows and people sitting in booth.
