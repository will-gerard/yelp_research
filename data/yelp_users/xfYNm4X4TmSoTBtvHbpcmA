What a waste of money.  I got home and cleaned off all the missed spots and glass that wasn't cleaned.  Not to mention when I was there I was hassled to upgrade to everything, even fixing my windshield. WTF

So, I struggled with how to handle my emotions and how to best communicate my experience.  Let's begin with the positives.  It was a Friday night (April 6th), Mom was in town for the weekend and wanted to take her to a good Mexican place I had been to many time in the past.  Waited 30 minutes, but no big deal as we started on a pitcher of margaritas.  An interesting note to begin with is the bar setup.  They have decided to save 1/4 of the total bar space as a server prep station.  When we started to drift over the tape line into this section on the bar we were shooed by one of the bus staff, pretty rude IMO, but made me wonder.  Why the hell would you steal precious bar space to have silver, napkins and pitchers of water a place to sit.  There are many other spots that could have been created for this purpose.  On to the meal, as always love the options presented and tried a new dish with an egg on top.  Love eggs with my meal.  My mom got fajitas and loved them as well. Finishing off the meal and the original pitcher was quite a challenge as the portions are very healthy.  The margarita was the house variety and not that flavorful, pretty much watered down.  That's when the rating hit the floor.  Upon finishing my margarita, I set my glass down and notice something in my glass. Whoa, that's a roach!  Not sure exactly how it got there, whether it  was in the pitcher of margarita or in my glass the whole time, but either way, completely disgusted.   At this point all the food was gone, and so was the roach margarita, so what to do.  Well since I really value yelp reviews and this is not something I caught at the beginning of the meal I decided to hold my thoughts for this review. No getting free meals, or making a scene, because honestly the food was good and I don't like getting stared at as I explain the circumstances.  So for everyone to see as proof, I'm going to attempt to upload the photo from that night.  If a roach got into my glass I wonder what else roaches have gotten into at this restaurant.  Let's just leave it at I won't be going back.

Love the food.  Typically order delivery and it arrives in reasonable time, every time.  Robbie (sp?), was very polite and friendly.  Even hooked me up with a free set of spring rolls for delivery, nice surprise.  Portions are always very adequate, enough for two meals.  Maybe one of these days we'll eat in to check out the place.  Definitely recommended!

Sam A you have painted a pretty good picture of why I will probably not go back.  Let me add to your review.  Let's see 93 degrees outside at 7pm and 100 inside from the opener til we left on May 5th. Seriously run the AC you're so cheap.  Next the sound, two towers of speakers way too loud for the concrete bomb shelter that is the marquee. Seriously add some noise dampening and don't blast the music.  Loud music just sounds more muddy with this crappy setup.  Next the fiberglass insulation falling apart in the ceiling, probably breathing it in during the show. Or probably not since the air wasn't blowing. Hustling bathroom attendant, really?   Re-emphasizing the expensive beer, seriously 6 for bud light and 7 for kiltlifter, its cheaper in Scottsdale.  Security is higher than any venue I have been to in phoenix, what gives?  pat down, id scan 4 tempe cops wasting taxpayers money and time hanging around doing nothing.   What a dump, bands if you ever read this do not play here. There are plenty of other good places to play.  Crescent, Mesa arts, Mesa amphitheatre, sail inn, or orpheum. This is approaching clubhouse bad and not far off it.

I like this place. It was my second time there and this time I ventured past the awesome pizza.  That is why it only gets 4 stars.  The mac and cheese was like easy mac, baked.  Not impressive at all.  The other dishes were great, Caesar salad and Bella Rosa pizza.  So, stick to the pizza, which is fantastic and you'll love this restaurant.

After a morning hike, this place was an awesome refilling station. Their food was so delicious and the atmosphere reminded me of a neighborhood eatery with a modern twist.  Didn't feel out of place even though we weren't in our Sundays best.  Love the rosemary potatoes and jalapeno cornbread.  Thanks for the eats!

I went here for my birthday dinner on a Thursday night.  Walking into the place it was very well laid out and a nice mixture of swanky lounge feel and then football games on the surrounding tv's.  The server, Jordan, was very good.  Most places bring you a scoop of icecream or something small for your birthday, this place wend the extra mile and let me pick from anything on the menu, nice touch!  I got the cajun shrimp and sausage skewers with white cheddar grits and decided to mix the two together for a little shrimp and grits action.  My girlfriend got the salmon and onion bread pudding, also great. Great choice for a nice night out; I will be back.

I bought a few Groupons to this place and used my first this Friday.  The line to order was about 8 deep, but it took about 10 minutes to get to the front to order.  2 registers, and only one person taking orders on a Friday night at 7? Once I gave my order I waited for my togo at a nearby bench.  I was able to watch the order times for all orders as they were entered since there was a monitor with the orders near the kitchen window.  I noticed a guy waiting for his order while I was in line, shaking his head and waiting impatiently.  I now know why he was disappointed.  It took 8:02 to assemble my order of an AZ burger and a Black Bean burger.  Really?  At this point I have spent 18 minutes from arrival to reception of my burgers.  I think most sit down restaurants can also meet this time with no problem, but this place specializes in burgers....?    Ok, now to review the food.  Our burgers were tasty, but they didn't replace the onions for grilled ones as I requested on one burger and the other burger didn't have fried pickles that I paid extra for.  Being in a hurry I didn't have time to check or go back to fix this.  I guess the discount I planned on from my Groupon was not really a discount after all :(   On a positive note, I did like their rosemary fries.  So much that I scarfed down the last ones without offering any to my girlfriend, oops.  For what it was, it was overpriced "slow food".  I guess I'll go back to use my other $12 groupon, but it'll be for just that, $12 worth in rosemary fries.  I might share some this time, ha.

Love this place. Great food, good beers, fried oreos! Had the wings and a burger this time. Not terribly busy for dinner but should be if you ask me.  Service was outstanding and if we were in the mood we would have stayed for the music that was setting up during dinner.  Great non-stereotypical Scottsdale scene for Scottsdale.

Went here for lunch with work friends and it was pretty awesome.  I had the TriCity Meat pizza, very good and filling. Nice alternative to the standard pizza joint.  Highly recommend this place.
