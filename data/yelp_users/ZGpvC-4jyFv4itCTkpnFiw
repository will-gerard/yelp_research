Always a pleasure walking into cold stone ! The smell is mezmoring and the staff is always upbeat, freindly, and smiling and ready to assist me. Ive been working my way through the flavour wheel and its partly because of the taste but like i said its always nice to go in there just to chat. The fact that the ice cream is A1 is a bonus!! Keep it up Cold Stone

I do belong to knockout fitness, im very true to them ahah but i also enjoy yoga so for that reason i went into mt. Side to see what was all the hype about and its a good facility clean people were ... generally nice i really wanted to do like 2.5 stars cause it wasnt a bad experience just not a memorable one i guess you could say, but maybe they sensed i didnt have to much intentions to sign up so they didnt take there time or what but id probably try another location cause the yoga class was good

I dont always get a coffee, but when i do... i make sure its from this starbucks ! Lol jk but honestly, im not a avid coffee drinker, but i really needed a pick me up so i went in to this starbucks and stephanie was there and im sure she had never seen someone take so long to order a drink ahah but she stayed surprisingly calm and just wanted to help me find the best drink for me and we did agree on this pink drink that absolutley rocked my socks off.

Great place to go out and have some fun and even better food! The service was quick, the food was delicious. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff all seemed to be having a good time working there so i also loved that. Its always nice to be in a place that the people working there like working there. Overall great experience and youll see me soon !:) hopefully for ufc 200!!

Just left House of Diamonds because i've been looking for a ring to propose to my girlfriend with and lemme tell you, what a set up ! Ahah Between the Jellyfish and the amazing selection of diamonds, my eyes were constantly wondering in ah. The staff was super helpful and were throwing out somereally cool ideas that honestly made the ring (that i was custom making by the way) 100x better. I really felt like i was with professionals at H.O.D and i cant wait to get back there and finish it !

Knockout fitness is an absolutley great place to workout! The staff is always polite and the instructors are just as awesome. The classes are the hardest workout ive ever had and i used to play college basketball! Getting started here was the best decision ive made, ive gotten stronger while leaning out and thats always something ive been lookin for ! I appreciate what knockouts done for me and i dont plan on leaving anytime soon !

Ok... so im a die hard chipotle fan, i even worked there lol, anyways, i was a little skeptical when my friend told me about this place at first, he said it was fresher and tastes better, and all this. Well when i walked in, extremely clean, smelled amazing, and the staff was on point with the portions and everything. Like i said im a die hard Chipotle fan but i would never turn a trip to Uberrito lol
