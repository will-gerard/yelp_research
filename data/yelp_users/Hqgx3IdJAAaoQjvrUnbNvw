The only theater we go to in the area. They keep it very clean.

I couldn't even sit for more then 5 minute while my oil was being changed without them making me get up to try to sell me something. They even tried to sell me on some charity thing. I came to get an oil change! Also they didn't turn of my service light which was on because I needed an oil change.

This place is magical! The staff is first class. They make you feel right at home. The dance is exciting and the instructors ease you in no matter what your level.  I first came to the studio as a guest for a halloween costume party. I fell in love with it and the adorable staff. I then did a 3 class trial. It was a blast. Unfortunately I didn't get to finish my whole trial. I live in north Phoenix and it was too much of a drive. If I lived in the area I'd definitely take more classes.  Great for couples getting married. You're sure to impress on the dance floor. I believe it would also be a great date idea to try a group or private class!

Best sushi in town hands down! I am a sushi guru and have been all over.  My dad has worked for a Japanese company all my life. When his clients come into town from Japan this is the only sushi place he'll take them because it's the best in town.   It is a small intimate place that has become a daddy daughter tradition. Him and I get together around Christmas time and splurge ourselves full of sushi and saki. We finish off with green tea ice cream, my absolute fav!!!  Love it, love it, love it! Can't say enough great things about Hiro!!!

This place made me so sick and I have an iron stomach for sushi. The volcano roll was horrible. Tasted like old hot canned tuna fish with mayo and cream cheese. I will never even think about going here again. Also horrible service. I'm not one to write many review but this place should not have as many stars as it does. Do not go here!

If you like the stuck up Scottsdale vibe this is a good place for you. The food isn't impressive. Nice outdoor seating.

This place is awesome! Some of the freshest sushi I've had. Love their spicy miso ramen and spicy tuna Donburi combo so affordable, delicious, and a ton of food! The only issue is it gets really packed and sometimes you will have to wait for a table and service may be a little slower at prime times. The wait is definitely worth it. I highly recommend!

I love the western theme & the mechanical bull is entertaining. Food is average but huge portions, great for sharing. The bartender's always give me free shots. Got to love that!

One word describes the food here...HORRIBLE!  Everything was salty! From the appetizers to the salad and soup. WAY too much salt, we couldn't even eat our sample platter because of the over seasoning. I seriously tasted salt in my mouth for 2 days after eating here and felt sick. I love salt. I practically drink soy sauce so you know it's REALLY bad when I say something is too salty.  I also had a salmon Caesar. Salmon was over cooked, lettuce soggy, and again salmon, salad SALTY! They need to keep their cooks away from the shaker!

I always get my baby shaved here! They aren't the best groomers but she loves it here, which is why I keep coming back!  I am so afraid that my dog isn't very social and I will have problems with her at the groomers! But I have always had great updates with her, Sydney (dog) is such a sweetheart and she enjoys being around the other dogs for a few hours and no problems grooming her which makes me extatict! She is such a hard dog and doesn't like anyone especially men so she always has a chick groomer. I don't even have to ask anymore! She loves the doggy interaction, it  makes her feel comfortable and me as well. She always goes here and she will for life. They are good to her and she's so happy after her doggy spa day! A bit more pricy but extremely worth it and her hair grows back fast!!!

Worst Panda Express ever! Possibly the worst meal we've ever spent money on. My hubby made the mistake of not checking the boxes of food before he left the restaurant. He came home with dinner. His teriyaki chicken was black, too burnt to eat. My beef and broccoli had one piece of beef and the fried rice was just rice and a little hard. Absolutely disgusting. Avoid this Panda Express by far the worst experience I've had with them.

Too expensive for what it is. Food is not all that great. Sushi rolls suck!

Can't say a lot I had a bacon bloody mary and a side which was of course fab because I love bloody marys. My friend gave me some of her turkey burger which was the best, most juicy turkey burger I've ever had, even with mayo on it! I hate mayo. The burger didn't come with fries which I hate! If I eat a burger I want some fries and I don't want to pay more. I want to Grease it up and go all out. I got a side of parmesan zucchini fries which were nothing special.  I will definitely go back and try a burger when I'm in the area and the mood to treat myself!

This place has amazing deals! There 50% off all rolls for the summer is divine! Not the greatest sushi in town but for the price and the experience A in my book!   My friend got a cucumber roll and the presentation was out of this world and fun! Think rave flashing light fun! We spent so much time taking pics of the food. For sure a fun friend event!   New regular affordable sushi place! Thought about going back again the next day because I drive past everday coming home from work!

I was unimpressed. Very surprised this place got such high reviews. It's definitely a hole in the wall. I had the beach house burger. Very greasy. The patty reminded me of a Wendy's burger. The fries were horrible they had bbq seasoning on them. Not my thing. I don't think I'll return I was looking for a nice juicy burger and this was more of a fancy fast food burger.

Great regular place if you're into yoga and zumba. Didn't get a chance to try their pilates classes but I'm sure they're a good workout too! Purchased a two week pass and utilized it as much as I could.   Their yoga instructors are a bit aggressive but enjoyed that throughly. They want you to be serious and do poses the right way. Savasana was great! A gentle push from instructor opening up the heart, relaxing the shoulders and neck. In most classes a light peppermint spray that opened up the sinuses and breathing.  Zumba was so much fun! A first time Zumba-goer, both instructors I took classes with made me feel very comfortable. Christina is amazing! Fun, full of energy, gets you going and her routine/experience shows! I took my first zumba class with her and really enjoyed it! I took another one with a different instructor and she seemed disorganized also it was hard to follow her but she was still tons of fun. Became a fan of Zumba here at One Love!  Really great place and really enjoyed it. The restorative class is amazing and I am not so much into all that but they put so much work in to making it exactly what you need. Also the owners are amazing and great people. So far out of all the different places I've been and experiences I've had in yoga this is the place I would call home. A bit pricey for what it is and far from my area unfortunately.

Did a free zumba class. They have all types of great free fitness classes every day of the week plus amazing smoothies and teas. Also get all your herbalife needs here. I just started mine.I hear great things from people I actually know so I've seen their dramatic results. I will be back to measure my results and try out some more free fitness classes.  Really want to try the yoga that's my thing!

Bought a Groupon $12 for $25 so I thought I'd check it out. I will never go back!  First thing that was very unpleasant was it was freezing in there. I understand they need to keep sushi cold but if it's fresh they shouldn't need to keep it to where our teeth were chattering. Next thing service was extremely slow. I mean come on it's not like you have to deliver much!   The sushi is shitty. There was only one roll we truly liked. I've had revolving sushi else where and I know it's not 4 star sushi but even for lower end sushi it was not worth money. Most of the rolls reminded me of low grade grocery store sushi.   My fiancé isn't too hip into sushi so he ordered the shrimp tempura. It took at least 20 minutes to come out. When it finally came it was freezing cold, inedible and the fried rice was disgusting.   I ordered a piece of sushi that wasn't on the belt and again took forever! I had to give the waiter a displeasing look as he stood around before he realized he forgot.   Do yourself a favor take you money else where even with a Groupon not worth it!!!

We had a blast! Got a Groupon 2 for $20, both houses and wasn't expecting too much because it was cheap compared to most. It was definitely worth it. They even got my fiancé who was trying to be tough and my heart was still racing on the way home! Lower budget haunted house but so much fun!
