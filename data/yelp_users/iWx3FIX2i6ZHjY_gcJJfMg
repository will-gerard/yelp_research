If you are looking for a good sandwich or salad without breaking the bank in an otherwise expensive Wynn casino, Zoozacrackers provides a good option.   Since they only serve soup, sandwiches, and other deli food, things move fairly quickly. They also have cream soda, though they were out of it when I ordered.  The triple-decker club sandwich on rye was excellent.  It was big enough to be filling and satisfied my hunger.  There was plenty of turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato.  The chop vegetable salad had an awesome balsamic vinegar on it that made it nearly irresistible.  If you are looking for fast deli food and not a five-star gourmet experience, this is the place for you.

This restaurant came highly rated on Yelp so we figured that we would give it a try.  What a terrible experience!  It took more than 45 minutes for an order of four rolls: a rainbow roll, california roll, and two spicy tuna rolls.  To make matters worse, people who came in more than half an hour after us got their food and were done before we even got our rolls!    The rolls, once they did finally arrive, were less than one-inch in diameter (i.e., less than half the size of rolls at most similar restaurants) and consisted mostly of rice and vegetables.  The only thing we did enjoy was the shrimp ordered from the "japanese tapas" menu, which tasted outstanding.    However we will never go back here, based on the horrible service and indifferent attitude of the staff.

This restaurant is a total post-modern 1950s-style diner, complete with a retro building design and counter service controlled by computerized buzzers that go off when your order is ready. It has been featured several times on the Food Network, and was on an episode of Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives," which have definitely put the restaurant on the map.   Everything about the place has character.  For example, the menu has standard hamburgers, as well as unique and tasty items like the Ahi Sandwich, or whatever special they happen to offer that is not on the menu.  When I was there, they were offering Pork Tenderloin and fresh-squeezed lemonade.  Everything we got was great.   The restaurant itself is located on a working farm, and has a nifty little outdoor seating area with benches underneath a huge and ancient pepper tree that provides some shade from the heat of the sun.  There is also a little grassy area where kids can run around, play, or have a picnic.  After you eat, you can also walk through various areas of the farm.  You can make your visit here a short one, or stay all afternoon.  There's a lot to see.   Though there are only two bathrooms, they are clean, and feature old school barbies and G.I. Joes in stainless steel, LED-lit cases in the walls.  They've also got old episodes of the Thunderbirds playing on small T.V.'s.  It's unique and compellingly awesome, like so much about this restaurant.   Be advised, however, that it can get slammed with customers on the weekends, and if you don't get there before the rush, be prepared to wait!  This is despite the fact that they are prepared to handle volume and pump out the food at an incredibly fast pace.   Overall if you are in the area, this place is worth trying at least once, for the experience.  In my opinion it's worth going back several times, just to try all the food.

The Palazzo is a beautiful hotel and casino, and let me preface this review with the statement that I've always been in awe of it.  My expectations of a stay here were met and even exceeded in a major way. We had a comfortable, enjoyable four days in Las Vegas.  Since my family has grown, the traditional two-twin bed rooms are not cutting it.  So we need a suite - and we got an amazing deal online for a suite at the Palazzo. It was my first time getting a suite in Las Vegas and we were really impressed.   Though the price was substantially more than an average hotel room on the strip, the value was definitely there. Everything about the room seemed elegant, luxurious, and tastefully appointed with a quasi-European style. The design of the suite is really unique as there is a "step down" in the middle of the room. The two queen beds plus a pull-out couch meant plenty of room for everyone.  There were two televisions, meaning that people could watch two different programs simultaneously.  The pools are also great.  There are several.  The Palazzo and the Venetian have a joint pool complex with at least six pools, including one fairly large shallow pool that is perfect for small children.  The area is quite large, meaning that there is plenty of room and it doesn't feel super crowded like some other pool complexes. Plus all of them are right next to the hotel towers and slightly raised above street level, meaning you have some pretty cool views of the Palazzo and Venetian towers, as well as some other nearby locations like the Mirage.  There are bars spread out amongst the pools, and there are also plenty of shady spots if you know where to look (major hint - ask the towel attendants, they know where all the good spots are)!  Overall this is one of the top pool complexes in Las Vegas.   The Palazzo is also adjacent to the Grand Canal Shoppes, which is an upscale-style mall filled with unique shops and restaurants.  The architecture of the mall is the medieval-Venice style, with marble buildings and a canal where you can actually take gondola rides.  The indoor ceiling is a sky that changes color as the "day" passes, with about 10-to-15-minute intervals.  There is a model Fontana di Trevi in the center of the mall, with a few amazing restaurants around it.  Overall, the Palazzo is an upscale luxury hotel that is superior in many aspects to others in its price range.  Highly recommended!

Unfortunately this was one of the more terrible experiences I've had at a breakfast buffet in Las Vegas.  There wasn't a wait to get into this one and we were in a hurry.  Unfortunately, we paid the price for that in more ways than one.  First, the cost - $25 per person.  Fairly standard, until you realize that they have seating for at least 400 people in the restaurant, which is usually half-filled, and only have one person pouring champagne, one person making omelettes, and then only one place to get hot food like eggs and bacon.  So what happens when the place gets full, is that you wait sometimes up to 10 MINUTES IN LINE to get a spoonful of eggs, or a couple pieces of bacon!  Want a refill on champagne? Gotta wait 5 minutes! Clearly the funding for this buffet has been sharply reduced, or it never had much at all.  Additionally, we decided to sit by the window next to what looked like a nice pond from a distance.  But when we sat down, it looked like the pond hadn't been cleaned in a very long time and there was a dead turtle floating in it!!!  If you are reading this - heed my advice and give this place a miss!  You would be better off going to a Denny's or even McDonald's for that matter!  There is certainly no value here.

This is a very unique, yet excellent example of a "yuppie nature" park.  If you've read my other reviews, "yuppie nature" parks are those where there are manicured and groomed "wildlife" areas that feature broad, smooth, largely flat trails that can easily be traversed by the elderly, children, or just about any would be "hiker" that wants to go for an adventure.  All of the plants and animals are maintained by park rangers who eliminate anything that does not fit with the motif of the park.   Don't get me wrong, these places are usually extremely cool and beautiful.  The Riparian Preserve in Gilbert is no exception. It has many excellent examples of local desert flora and fauna, as well as several man-made ponds designed to attract migrating waterfowl and other more permanent resident birds.  There is a drought right now, so most of the ponds are dried out, but there are still a few out there which have many different interesting species of birds, including wood ducks, regular mallard ducks, white herons, hummingbirds, and other creatures which can be identified by the signs that are posted all around the different ponds.  There are also many helpful signs in front of different trees, bushes, and flowers so you know what you are looking at.  There are also play areas for children, including a few "dinosaur footprint" areas where little kids can have a great time discovering real dinosaur footprints in the cement.  There is also a small planetarium where you can view things at night, and learn about planets during the day.  The local library is also a beautiful and fairly new structure with many excellent offerings for anyone with the time to investigate.  If you are in the area and looking for something unique to do outdoors and the weather is right, be sure to visit this place.  It is really special and worth your time.

This restaurant openly discriminates against people with children. If that appeals to you, great, but wait - there's more!  It has terrible service too.  We walked up with our three kids when we saw there were at least six tables open.  We were told "there was a reservation" and that we could put our name on the list.  We did and went for a walk, for about 45 minutes.  We walked by again and guess what?  The same tables were open.  I asked again and guess what we were immediately seated, though the hostess seemed unwilling to do so.  What about that list? It was never mentioned.  They put us in the back corner.  I saw the same open table in the front patio that had been and still was open when we first asked to be seated.  And when I asked, you guessed it, a "reservation."    The hostess had an extremely unwelcoming attitude. She said that they didn't have a kids' menu and we would have to order off of the adults menu.  Once we sat we were ignored for about 10 minutes.  It was clear that we weren't welcome, so we got up and left.   When I walked by an hour later after eating somewhere else, that table was still open.     Let's get one more thing straight - this is no gourmet restaurant - it's in the middle of a mall adjacent to a food court!  There are kids and families everywhere.  Yet another business that has no need for paying customers! Don't bother going there!

This water show in front of the Bellagio has become one of the quintessential things to do while you are in Las Vegas. It is absolutely free and is not something you should miss.  The 100 + water jets are synchronized to classic Las Vegas show tunes and Frank Sinatra songs.  At night, the songs and water also include different colored lights which can be really dazzling.  While this show can look really neat when you are driving by on the Strip, it is really something that you should take the time to see in person on the sidewalk.   During the weekend and busy times they run a show every15 minutes to half hour. So if you have the time it is worthwhile to watch one or two shows because there are many different ones that play throughout the day and night.  The area has also become popular with sidewalk musicians, performers, and other characters you can take pictures with. So there is more entertainment than just the show. I would totally recommend making it one of your stops while you were in Las Vegas.

This company charges higher rates for property management than many other companies in the area.  They additionally charge hundreds of dollars extra for items which are not typically included as extra charges in standard property management contracts.  They also charge service fees on taxes paid on properties!   From what I have observed, company representatives do not follow directives given by legal representatives, and are not willing to discuss fees for services, stating that they are "not negotiable."  In particular, avoid Scott Laflen, who is particularly arrogant about the "quality" of services that he overcharges for.   These business practices, and borderline hostile attitude toward at least one customer who paid them thousands of dollars per month, would lead to my strong recommendation that you take your business elsewhere.

If you are staying at the Palazzo, this is a super-convenient gourmet hamburger place right to the left on the second floor as you get off the elevator! It usually is not busy and the food is pretty good.  I found myself returning multiple times during my stay.   Like any self-respecting modern hamburger place, they have several exotic burger options, as well as many different beers on tap.  Although things can get a bit pricey, they do have a great happy hour with half-price appetizers and deals on drinks (which I enjoyed on more than one occasion during my stay).  If you order a large beer, you can bring the cup back later for a $5 discount on the next beer.    The receipt you get is also good for 25% off of a breakfast order - and although I didn't try it, I heard good things about it.  If you are looking for something quick, easy, and pretty good, this place will hit the spot!

Like the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino where it's situated, the Wicked Spoon is a hip, trendy buffet in classic Las Vegas style. It definitely has a high-end flair, all the way from the silverware and plates, to the food itself.  We were here on a holiday weekend and it was quite pricey - $$$ - but the younger kids under 4 were free so it did have value.  This buffet has a brilliant solution to portion control and avoiding food waste - virtually every food offering comes in its own small stainless steel or ceramic bowl.  Now, you might think this would be annoying but having experienced it myself, the bowls look really cool and the amounts in them do not really seem to small once you get them back to the table.    The food offerings here are mostly standard for Vegas buffets: salad bar, crab legs, sushi, dessert bar. Nothing to special or outstanding. However, there are a few brilliant standouts that bear mentioning here, which makes this place worth trying.   First and foremost, and probably the best part of the whole buffet, is the fresh seafood you can get cooked to order.  It is set up similar to an omelette station at a brunch. They have fresh shrimp, scallops, red snapper, mussels, and various other things you can get custom made in a tomato or scampi broth (mixed is best), with a bit of spice.  And my god, is it good!  I'm tempted to go back there just for this.  Secondly, they actually have RARE prime rib, which is a "rarity" in and of itself.  Ha! Virtually every place that serves prime rib has it medium or well done, so this was a pleasant change of pace. We likes it raw! (If you want it more well done, they will grill it up for you on the spot.)    For desert, beyond the standard carrot cake, chocolate-covered strawberry, and custard offerings, they also have fresh-scooped gelato of many different flavors. They again serve it up in relatively small cups, so if you want a lot, you need to order multiple scoops. But the bright side of this is that you can try many different kinds - and let me tell you from personal experience - they're all good!  Overall this buffet was a slam dunk and really good in my opinion.  I was totally satisfied and would go back again. And again, and probably again after that.

When you walk into the Palazzo from the Wynn bridge, you will smell an awesome Italian-pizza-tomato sauce smell, and Grimaldi's is where it's coming from. After striking out at a few other places on Friday night, we remembered that smell and followed our noses.  It turned out to be a pretty good idea.    Pizzas are cooked to order in a wood-fired pizza oven.  It has standard Italian pizzeria decor and they can accommodate fairly large groups, as there are some bigger tables there.  Plus most of the seats have a pretty good view of the bridge entrance of the Palazzo.   The basic large pizza is what you get for a flat fee, and then each topping is a couple extra dollars.  If you keep it simple, it is very affordable.  Like a proper pizza, everything is thin crust. They only have traditional toppings, like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, et cetera - you won't find any pineapples here!  The cheese is real pieces of fresh mozzarella, not shredded generic cheese.  So you won't have complete cheese coverage, but it will be great.  The salads you can order are also family style and fairly large.  They are worth it.   Overall if you are looking for an affordable,simple, and tasty pizza, this place is a good bet.

Maybe we got lucky, but we had a great experience at this hotel. It was by far the best deal in town on Friday night, less than $75 for a room with a view in Vegas!  It is located just a block or two from the Strip  It was apparent that word has gotten out about this place, since the check-in line was at least 35 people long (even at 12 a.m.!).  Note that when we went back to the room later that night like at 2 a.m., it was even longer!  However, I will say that even though the line was long, it was moving all the time.  The staff was doing an excellent job checking people in and moving them through the line.   The room we received had been recently renovated - everything looked new and was very clean.  We had a 55" HDTV, with two double beds, and new furniture.  We were on the 15th floor and still had a decent view of the hotel grounds and some of the hotels on the Strip. In fact, it was an awesome room for the price we paid.   The hotel itself used to be the Las Vegas Hilton.  It has a bunch of cool Elvis memorabilia, as well as some nice casino decor.  It also offers the standard table games and slot machines that you can find everywhere else.  They also have a large and highly-recommended sports book area, which is worth investigating if that's your thing.  Another bonus of this hotel is that the monorail terminal is accessible right from the hotel itself - meaning that you don't have to drive to get to some of the biggest casinos on the strip, including MGM, Bally's, Caesar's Palace, and Harrah's/LINQ.   Overall if you are looking for a good deal in a reasonably clean hotel this is a solid choice. Four stars!

This is the first all-you-can-eat steam table takeout Chinese food place I've ever been to. And I have to say the experience was interesting. Forget about getting enough of your favorite dish!  You can have as much as you want.  The food itself consisted of all the standard offerings you find at a Chinese food place like this: chow mein, rice, broccoli beef, orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and the like. The food was all pretty good.  Another cool part is that they offer and all you can eat salad bar when you dine in that has salad (obviously), fruit, and a few other healthier options.  The restaurant itself was clean and looked new. They have a big screen TV which happens to be excellent for watching Monday Night Football. I I enjoyed some of the game as I devoured many portions of food. The bathrooms were also clean and we're in good working order.   Overall if I lived nearby, I would probably go here all the time for fast food Chinese.
