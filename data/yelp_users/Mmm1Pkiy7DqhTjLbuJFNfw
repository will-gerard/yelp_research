We come here about once a month, and despite it's dive strip-mall appearance, it's one of the coolest sports bars on the west side.  The pros: Lots of stuff to do inside, and the bar is bigger than it looks.  Plenty of televisions, and the beer is priced right.  Food is well above average for a bar.  Like, really good.  Pizza is one of the best in town.  Service on the inside is good, but a word of caution for those who like to sit on the patio... we have waited up to 25 minutes to be acknowledged out there.  So patio service is hit or miss (get a drink at the bar inside and tell the bartender to send a server outside).  If you want to combine happy hour with another good value, check out the $3 movie theater next door!

Ive been coming here regularly for 7 years.  Zipps has some of the best beer specials in town and pretty good bar food.  The servers are top notch, and the patio is a chill place to chat with friends or people watch.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best nights for food: Tuesday for 6 dollar specialty burgers and Thursdays for foccacias.  The patio has heaters for chilly winter nights and misters for the summer.  There is a drawback though... As this location trains managers and servers for their new locations, you can have off nights.

The food is fairly decent here, and it's pretty much the only restaurant within 5 miles of its location.  Their grinders and sandwiches are good, the salads are not so great, and the pizza is average/above average.  The reason this place doesn't get another star is the price.  You may do a double take when you see how much they charge for what you get. $10 for a tiny side salad you can get for a buck at Wendys.  Pizzas are $25+ (for a large), and 6 inch sandwiches are roughly 10 bucks.  I know the rent in this area is high, so maybe it's not the fault of the restaurant that they charge so much, but as a value-driven consumer, I find it really hard to bite the bullet and eat here.

One word, crap.  I'm a fan of local strip mall bars, but this place doesn't offer anything interesting of note.  The food is par for the course at best, the drinks are uninspiring, the decor is blah, and the service is just okay.  So you might think why not give it 3 stars... Well, unfortunately the clientele that frequent this place drag it down.  I've never seen so many mean, burnt out drunks so willing to pick a fight over nothing in my life.  A friend and I went in there, sat down, and ordered some drinks... a customer across the bar from us stared at me the entire time (literally, never took his eyes off me).  I got out my camera to take a happy little picture and the guy next to me asked me why I took a picture and then informed me he would be ramming the camera down my throat if I took another one.  That was my signal to leave the joint.  Zipps is so much more fun, lively, and enjoyable.  Maybe the nasty attitude is an Irish thing, who knows.  I won't be giving this place another chance.

Great mom and pop hole in the wall kind of place.  Food is great--everything we've ever ordered was tasty.  It's not the most amazing burger in the world but it beats fast food, and at a similar price point.  Also delicious are the deep fried sides (zucchini, mushrooms, pickles, etc), and they have an amazing selection of glass bottled sodas.  One area of concern is the strip mall it's in needs renovation, the parking lot is too small/confusing, and Church's Chicken is awkwardly placed.  Oh well, what can you do, it's 35th avenue.

First time here; went in on a Friday evening.  Parking lot is small and there was one spot left.  Restaurant was very busy, so we sat at the bar.  The sign by the front door said "now serving beer and wine", so if you were waiting for that addition, it has arrived.  We ordered the egg rolls, chicken satays, massaman curry, and garlic sauce.  I had 2 glasses of wine, and it was boxed wine, but this isn't a wine cafe so I'm not going to let that get me down.  Bottom line is this: service was excellent, and the food was the best Thai I've had in the valley to date.  I like my food spicy, and this place delivers.  (We ordered a hotness of 4, which is Thai hot).  The only flaw in the entire order of food was one of the larger potato pieces in the massman was undercooked.  But still, I cannot dock a star off the overall experience.  We will definitely be back.  Another positive I feel I should mention is that they have televisions... so now you can go on Sunday and catch some games while you eat :)
