I'm so HAPPY! I now have a brand new laptop computer that I just LEASED from RedSeven. For a small deposit and monthly fee I have a new. speedy computer and RedSeven is basically responsible for any issues. They will help me over the phone, at one of their stores and I even get some house calls.    Ask them about their worry-free leasing program!

Elevate appears to not care about answering their customers. I sent the quoted text below to them two ways: via email and a FB message and received NO response for either. In conclusion, not only is their service sub-standard and their products mediocre, they feel no need to address their customers comments.  "I spent some time at Elevate this evening...had some tea and decided to order some famous Rock Springs pie. I've never tried it. First of all, the service was nonexistent. I was given a number to take back to my table, 15 minutes later, nothing. I had to go to the counter...then they got it! It's not as if it was busy! The pie was visually unimpressive, especially for almost $5! It looked kind of small, fallen apart and no garnish. It tasted nice but nothing better than I could do.  I'm glad I didn't pre-tip for no service!" (originally emailed April 7th, 2013...then a FB message April 11)
