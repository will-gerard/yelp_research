This place is awesome sauce!its only down the street from me and i think i might be in trouble I had the green chili pork handpie which is amazing and vanilla creme brulee also so good...one of the more decadent creme brulees i have ever had.this place is adorable and i cant wait to try all the other handpies both sweet and savory.They also have breakfast handpies can't wait to try those aswell.great quick food for a good price.I plan on being a regular

I bought a groupon for this salon months ago and have called and left multiple messages to schedule an appt for at least 5 months,i had no reply or call back....when trying to get my money back groupon didn't let me.i pretty much just gave this salon free money.whoever owns this salon is running a scam on groupon talking peoples money but not following through with answering messages and providing the services advertised and purchased .at one point i thought maybe this salon closed but after seeing several reviews i think not.happy to know some clients got their services that they paid for via groupon.makes me very angry throwing money away and being taken advantage of!bad business terrible customer service or lack or service should i say!

Worst Hawaiian food i have ever had....ate it hours ago and my stomach is aching .the macaroni was flavorless,bbq beef was so fatty ,kalbi ribs nohing but fat,even the chicken was low quality meat.growing up in southern California I expected more....best Hawaiian food i have had in Arizona is aloha kitchen in mesa only 5-7 mins from this nasty place and way better quality,taste,and portions. Dont waste your money here!!!!!

Mischa is amazing!great customer service and my hair came out beautifully.i did a cut and all over color and im so happy with the healthy bounce and shape of my cut as well as the beautiful organic color she did.her prices are very good considering we are in old town Scottsdale and she took her time and made sure my experience was comfortable and pleasant .I will be returning for many more hair appointments!she uses great top notch products like paul mitchell and organic hair dye  most places in scottsdale dont do as great of a job and charge an arm and a leg.i highly recommend seeing mischa for all your hair needs
