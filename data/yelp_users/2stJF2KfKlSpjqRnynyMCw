Let me start by first expressing my amazement that there are, as of now, no Yelp reviews for such a unique place. How can it be that this hidden gem of a store has evaded exposure? My guess would be that, after visiting, its clientele chooses never again to type on a boring old laptop.   That being said, I'm the sort of person who is petrified of venturing into niche shops - including, but not limited to: cobblers, tailors and violin stores - for fear that my absolute lack of knowledge on the subject will be cripplingly obvious. But, with a troublesome typewriter and less than 24 hours before Valentine's Day, I overcame this fear and called up Mesa Typewriter Exchange.   One of the benefits of these labor-of-love sort of stores is the unparalleled customer service, and Bill was no exception. He offered to meet me at the store at 7 PM, well past normal business hours, and when I showed up he was cheerful and excited to see my machine. Bill is a contagious mix of enthusiastic, knowledgeable, patient and unpretentious. Within a matter of minutes he had replaced the ribbon and had my typewriter working as good as new.   The shop itself is overflowing with typewriters of all sorts and sizes, from all decades and in all conditions. The fact that someplace like this exists, undiscovered, in the heart of downtown Mesa is a modern miracle, and anyone and everyone within 30 miles of this place should, at the very least, stop in for a look around, if not to fall in love with a typewriter of their very own.

I loved this place - it was the end of the summer and I had just a week to move out, at a time when everyone in this area was doing the same (college students and whatnot). After making an online reservation, I decided I couldn't waste time, so I called up the office. The owner was helpful and suggested that I come in any time before 7PM. I was worried about finding an available storage unit, especially in the smallest size and at the lowest price ($30 for a month), but I was able to get into one for no money up front (except the cost of a lock) and move in that same night!   This facility is clean, the management is nice, it is quiet, I feel safe and offers all-hours access (just ask). Very easy to work with, and I will definitely use them again. When they called to inform me that my payment was due (and a day late, no less), I told them that I had moved out a week ago and the nice young man helping me said "Oh, well, since you used it for less than a month and we have a BOGO offer going on, we won't be charging you at all." How great is that? All I had to do was come in and get a receipt. Absolutely recommended.

I've lived at the Rancho Las Palmas complex for the last two years and can't spread enough good word about the place. My one bedroom apartment provides more than enough room for me and would easily house a spouse, number of pets and even a small child, should the need arise. I have an open kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, and stove, all modern and complete with necessary functions (I love to cook and get endless use out of these appliances).   After moving from one dorm to the next, one apartment to another, I'm elated to have found a place I can call home. I searched a 20-block radius around this place and found only cheap, ungated communities with hideous interiors and no amenities. This complex is a hidden gem for just a small amount more than what you would pay at those other places. As a plus, it is inhabited mostly by small, minority families who are quiet, friendly and respectful, as compared to most apartments in the area that are populated by perpetually drunk college students playing Skrillex at 4AM.   The landlords are friendly, know all their tenants by name and go the extra mile to make me feel taken care of. I feel incredibly safe in this community, even late in the evening, walking to and from the laundry room (one of Rancho Las Palmas' only downsides). In addition, maintenance is lickety-split. In almost all cases I have had same-day service and the problem was fixed without trouble (including a leaky ceiling, clogged dishwasher and lack of hot water, although these problems are few and far between).   Really, the only cons of living at Rancho Las Palmas is the fact that it can be noisy. As mentioned, most of the tenants are quiet as dormice, but the walls are thin, and if you have loud neighbors, you will hear them clomping about. In most cases, this isn't an issue, although for a while my upstairs neighbors fought loudly and walked aggressively across the floor for weeks on end. Also, some units, including mine, directly face the train tracks. I never hear the train anymore and sleep soundly through the night, but some might have a different experience.  All in all, this is a great place to live in Tempe. Location is superb - just off of Apache and Dorsey, you can walk to the light rail, the mall across the street or to campus, while still avoiding a lot of the raucous ASU crowd. If I could live here into perpetuity, I would, but I hope my future holds bigger things for me than staying here.

Unfortunately, my experience was much similar to Mark's. The staff was indeed friendly, but entirely unequipped to provide proper attention to a patient's individual needs. My therapist, Melissa, was nice, but after the initial assessment she failed to explain in any detail the source of my pain, where it might have come from or illustrate a course of action. Instead, I was handed a sheet of exercises that looked like I could have printed it off of Google.  Melissa often had more than one patient scheduled during our appointments. I would arrive, and she would have me work on a machine while she saw to someone else. On multiple occasions I would spend entire minutes sitting, motionless, waiting for Melissa to come back and instruct me. This is "treatment" - time that I was billed for! This did not seem to be the case with Melissa alone, either. At almost all times there were at least six patients for a total of two or three therapists. One morning a woman even brought her labrador into the treatment room and it proceeded to bound around, off-leash, for her entire session. I'm a dog lover as much as the next person, but it's bad enough I have to share precious time with other members of the same species, much less a dog!  Ultimately, I received no relief, no specialized attention and no care. I stopped treatment after three visits and would not recommend this clinic. In addition, as Mark said, be sure to read the "Welcome" form - it will inform you what your insurance deductible is and how much has been met. Under my plan, previous chiropractic and physical therapy treatments had not been subject to a deductible, but my benefits had recently changed. I was shocked to get a bill in the mail for $570! That is an outrageous amount to pay for such poor care: patients need to be informed of what mediocre medical treatment will cost them.   I will add that, after expressing my dissatisfaction to the Patient Services manager, she was quick to respond and offer a resolution that I thought was fair. As stated before, the entire staff is courteous and patient, but I would caution that it may be worth your time to seek treatment elsewhere.

I have an unabashed addiction to scoring insane deals on clothing, and Sunset Clothing Exchange is a complete enabler. I stopped in just this last weekend to do some spring shopping and was thrilled at the deals I found. Two French Connection dresses with the tags still on: $128 marked down to $35 each, and two tops and a BCBG skirt with the $78 store tags still on, marked down to $20.   Certain brands make frequent appearances here, often times brand new. The owner tells me they have agreements with local boutiques who often have to purge excess or end-of-season garments. Brands include FCUK, Giani Bini, BCBG, Jessica Simpson, Sanctuary and Cynthia Vincent, among many other designers. The selection is much higher end than Buffalo Exchange (or, y'know, Goodwill), meaning that you have to do a lot less browsing to get to the good stuff. The kind folks at Sunset have done all that hard work for you!  Perhaps my favorite aspect of Sunset is the apathetic attitude - at first glance, this may seem like I bad thing, but I, for one, am an avid shopper, and like to peruse the racks without being constantly pestered by sales people. The folks at Sunset leave you alone to do your purchasing in peace, but are forthcoming with friendly comments ("Do you work out? Your legs are amazing!") and warm banter when you so engage them.   I have been dropping in here for at least two years now, when I get tired of roaming the endless racks at Buffalo Exchange a few blocks down and need to find some cute duds quick. There's free parking out front, the store is never busy, the clothes are designer, the prices are reasonable and they've got some pretty kickass local art up on the walls. Plus, the owner let me shoot (and acted in) a scene for my movie there a few years ago. So how would I describe Sunset Clothing Exchange? I think "chill as fuck" about does it.

I could spend this review harping on all the others who unfairly compare Engrained to a five-star restaurant, but I'd rather focus on the fact that Engrained is of such a caliber that people are even able to confuse the two. Keep in mind that this café is essentially a school cafeteria that happens to cater to outside guests.   When Engrained first opened, I was thrilled. I spent almost every spare cent I had enjoying lunch there twice a week. The restaurant is built in the spot where a previous café had burnt down, and follows in the footsteps of Arizona State's sustainability initiative. At first, it was incredibly slow, but three years later and there are almost never enough tables to seat everyone who shows up for lunch. Yes, the ordering system is a bit archaic, but I like the freedom it affords me to browse (and, also, not to tip). Hint: tell the hostess you'll be eating outside, place your order at the sushi station to avoid lines and head out onto the beautiful Starlight Terrace to seat yourself.   Although I am not affiliated with the business, I have dined there so often that I have come to be on a first-name basis with both the original Assistant Chef, Chadwick, and the new one, John, as well as some of the waiters. You will also see the manager and owner here on an almost daily basis. It's very obvious that the people who work here care about what they're doing. The food staff has always been kind to me, and are very knowledgeable about the items they're serving.  The other day I had a side salad and was absolutely thrilled to notice fresh, nutty fiddleheads in the mix. When I enquired, the Head Chef, Jerome, told me they had been sourced from Sonoma Valley.  Engrained used to advertise it's menu as all from within 200 miles of Arizona State. I'm sure their customers caught on that they weren't locally sourcing ahi tuna, but that doesn't detract from Engrained's sustainable and green practices. They use real plates and silverware, recycled napkins, fair trade coffee and the restaurant itself is built out of renewable resources such as bamboo. In addition, they observe sustainable seafood practices, use cage-free eggs and free-range beef. Food is sourced locally when possible, from valley locales such as Queen Creek Olives, Shamrock Farms and, most notably, right from the ASU campus. I have personally eaten dishes made with the campus' Seville oranges, dates and lemonquats.   The menu changes on a rough two-week schedule, but always includes a few staples such as artisan pizza, paninis, quesadillas and a burger. There are also salads, soups, sushi and dessert to choose from, as well as the "Engrained Trio," a small sampling of a salad, entreé and dessert for $7.   Menu items run the gamut from pork loin with peach chutney paninis to chicken scallopini to eggplant ragout, and everything in between. Prices can be steep (from $5 - $15), but it's not too difficult to find something delicious and affordable here.   Overall, Engrained is a restaurant that offers an amazingly healthy and high-caliber alternative to other campus dining establishments. It has come a long, long way since it first opened it's doors. The restaurant is always seeking to do better, often holding seminars for staff and students alike, as well as participating in numerous other community events, such as the farmer's market on campus. On a number of occasions I have written suggestions on the comment cards and later been personally approached by either a chef or the manager, telling me they had appreciated and would be considering my suggestions.   I would recommend that anyone in the area try Engrained at least once, keeping an open mind and remembering what a noble cause this restaurant is striving for on a campus where a Big Mac and Frappuccino qualify as "lunch"

As a rule, I never review something until I've visited it at least three times. My first experience at Tempe Farmers Market, however, was so remarkable that I can't wait to share it.   My friend Chris and I walked in on a slow, sunny Tuesday afternoon and were immediately greeted by an incredibly cheerful gentleman who proceeded to crank up the radio when Chris told him it was playing his favorite song. After a few minutes of looking around, the man brought us a shopping cart and insisted that we had to fill it up. I told him politely that I would take a basket instead (these are Circuit City baskets with the logos sandpapered off. Very chic).   A young woman working behind the counter proceeded to bring us a huge back of sourdough rolls and told us they were on the house because they were dated five days prior. We would eat them with local cheddar cheese for lunch, and there was nothing wrong with them - still delicious and soft. A second man talked to us about the new produce they had in, including some interesting rainbow carrots and some bizarre, flat onions called Ciopinni.   Overall, the prices are moderate. Some things are comparable to or better than a grocery store - $0.99/pound for non-organic onions, $1.99 for a good sized bag of organic cane sugar, $2.99 for a bottle of Martinelli's. Some things were a bit pricier - $7 for local honey, $6 for a box of organic cranberries. I would imagine it depends on the product and season. Tempe Farmers Market carries a nice if small selection of produce, dairy, bread, some meats and many other local goods. I was a bit disappointed to see things like Coke and Cheerios on the shelves, as these are not local and certainly not organic, but I understand that they have a college-minded set to cater to.   The cherry on top of our visit was when our greeter brought us a cup of organic watermelon cubes. We looked at him suspiciously when he offered it to us. "Just... stick our fingers in?" He nodded enthusiastically. It wasn't until we popped the fruit in our mouths that he let us know it had been soaked in a certain Russian spirit.  Guess that explains his friendliness!  During check out he proceeded to give us - for free - a package of his basil pesto spaghetti, and the second man instructed us on the best way to prepare it. He even tucked a sprig of basil in with the onion. Tempe Farmers Market accepts credit, debit, cash and food stamps, and they were delighted to see that I had brought my own bag. Overall, the energy here is great and there's no attitude like I sometimes get from people in the "hipster sector." I plan to visit again tomorrow for more rolls for Thanksgiving dinner!

Don't let the obvious IKEA lights put you off: Canteen has captured lightning in a bottle, as far as Mill Avenue is concerned. I was present for drinks at the Grand Opening, for Happy Hour on a second visit and for dancing on a third. Truly, Canteen operates masterfully at each of these levels, all while somehow managing to maintain an air of that oh-so-elusive adjective: class.  Canteen keeps business good by opening only at 4PM, which is just in time for their Happy Hour. At this time, the place is slow, but the food is delicious and the prices are right. A plate of three gourmet miniature tacos for less than $5 hits the spot, and don't even get me started on their on-the-rocks style margaritas. Delicious, wickedly strong and, thankfully, made of forgiving ingredients including agave nectar, lime juice and 100% agave tequila. Just one or two of these is more than enough to get the party started. In addition to great food and drink, it seems that Canteen has gone to extraordinary lengths to hire only waitstaff that might make the pages of GQ or Maxim, and are incredibly personable too boot.   As afternoon fades into night, the lights dim, candles are lit and the music swells. Canteen has concocted the perfect atmospheric blend of fun, friendly, upscale and intimate.  On weekends, however, it's another story. The tables are moved aside and people pour onto the patio, where there is an open bar (that, oddly enough, served only margaritas and did not know what a "Citron and tonic" was, but who am I to complain?). Somehow, everything that is wrong with Mill remains far away from Canteen, as if the place is protected by some sort of enormous bro-squito net. The people are beautiful, well dressed (not a popped collar in sight) and, for the most part, the men seem to understand the concept of "look, don't touch."   Ten of us arrived on a Saturday, and it took us no time at all to vote our night at Canteen the best we've ever had. Great music, great drinks, great dancing without any of the cheap alcohol, sweat and lecherousness that generally ruins a perfectly good night out with the girls.  All in all, Canteen has my vote, day and night.
