Shroom deep dish was my favorite pizza in college, but I haven't had one in years.  So all of a sudden when we were wandering around Tempe and saw Pizzeria Uno, I thought that I just got to have one.  It was a mistake.  The mushroom tasted highly acidic, nothing like at all like my fond memories of the dish.  Also my waiter spent most of his time hanging out with his buddies' tables.  So menu, drinks and pizza took much longer than warranted.

A great place with impossible parking.  Just  a minor hurdle on my way to a cute neighborhood hang out place in a neighborhood that I don't live in.    Good sandwich, better pizzas and best vibe for a little cafe-like place in Phoenix.

After tasting these donuts, I realized that not all Rainbow Donuts are created equal. These are the best I've had in the Valley.  Worth braving those early Sunday mornings to get my fix.

The long line at CPK for a weekend dinner is testament to the triumph  of good location over mediocre food and not very good service by the  frazzled staff.

Fast food burger the way it's meant to taste.  Fresh beef and lettuce and non-frozen potato fries with a super thick vanilla shake to fill out any remaining empty spots in my stomach.   And as a frosting on an already yummy cake, it's open till late too.

Though I'm not much of a crafter, each time I wander into Micahel's I get totally sucked in by all the strange and interesting doo-dads.  Wandering down the aisles, my thoughts usually go along the progression of of what-the-heck to (figuring out what the item actually is) holy-heck-that-is-cool to (looking at price tag) whoa-that-is-so-not-cheap.     I'll end up with cool odds & ends that I'll end up not using, but thoroughly enjoying myself in the process.

Pasta Pomodoro is chain Italian's answer to Peet's Coffee.  Good consistent modern Italian, almost a neighborhood place and not as corporate as Starbucks.  And much like Peet's, Pasta Pomodoro also originated from the San Francisco bay area.  You're welcomed with bread and a delicious olive oil basil parsley dip.  The apps are also delicious with stand outs like the shrimp with garlic and chili (though the menu said cast iron pan, ours came on regular plate).   The ravioli with brown butter and sage is so good that I usually order it as a main.  A terrific classic pasta dish is vongole with linguine.  If you don't have a great neighborhood Italian joint, then Pasta Pomodoro will take care of you in a pinch.

I'm a fan of Aladdin, except when I'm in a hurry.  The owner told me that he prepare everything from scratch.  But it all does take a while.  So go ahead and call in your order for some kick@#$ gyro or chicken shawarma, or just be patient.  Home cooking takes time.

May be I went on a bad day for the kitchen, but the dishes I had was well below the average touristy level.  - the salsa that came with the chips tasted generic and canned - the menudo was a quarter chunk of a potato, half of a carrot cut in two and some blobs of flavorless beef - the mexican pizza was soggy and chewy (no, not in a good way) - the green corn tamale covered in chilli sauce is the only thing that made me think the kitchen can be better  La Fonda Del Sol is a place that I pass by a lot.  But it looks like I'll have to keep on passing on by.

After going to My Florist for  Sunday lunch, I'm in with the less-than-thrilled-with-it group of yelpers.     The place was half-empty (guessing that most people were elsewhere for brunch as opposed to lunch) and yet we were ignored by our waiter (multiple requests needed for him to procure us water, coffee, utensils).  Moreover, the reuben sandwich was bland, while the asparagus salad tasted mostly of canned artichoke.  The place is cute, but I would need either better food or better service for me to go back.

I'm can't help but join the 5 stars fan club for T&G Academy.  Thanks Elle T for the tip.  It was many months since my last cut so I had to take several inches off and I wasn't sure if this would be the right place.  But I loved it, loved it and my SO loved it too.  Can't get more bangs for my 12 bucks.    Yeah, it was crowded, but I made an appointment ahead of time, so no wait for me.  I also asked for someone who was close to graduation.

I love this place.  But then again I like standing in lines.  The longer the line, the more reassured I am the the food is likely to be good.  So I was estactic to be told that it would be a 2 hour wait till we get seated.  Not that waiting was any hardship with Bar Bianco so close at hand.  I was half-way gone before I can start on the pizza, so I don't remember too many specifics, but I do remember that it was good.

This place is amazing.  Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.  I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.  It's modern and Asian.    Went there with 2 friends and the food was great and the service was superb.  My friend loved it so much that she is going to bring her Mom on her next visit.  The stir fry shrimp dish was wonderful with large shrimps.  The green bean was so delicious that I want to add it to my next Thanksgiving dinner.  I had a bit of trouble with the bones on the roast duck, but it was finger licking good.  The only miss for us that night was the pot sticker because we didn't like the thick wrapping though the fillings were quite tasty.  I agreed with Nicole that most of the clientele are on the older side, but with the great food, service and reasonable pricing, I could care less how old the people at next table are.

OMG! This place is awesome...my new favorite fancy date night place that won't be breaking budget.  We had 3 dishes each which left us with barely enough room for the yummy deserts. My chef suggested trio was a recession friendly $24 for crunchy cream fried risotto balls, followed by halibut and lobster chunks and finished off by 2 giant prawns (these suckers were half the size of my palm), Mean while, P. ordered roasted cauliflower, froi gras, and snails. We ended up splitting everything including the deserts of cream brulee (trio again with vanilla, chocolate and grand marnier) and fried to order donut holes.  Couldn't ask for a more satisfying meal.

I'm not a vegetarian, but some friends visiting from out of town are.  After taking them here for dinner the other night, they loved it so much that we had to go back there for lunch the next day.  Their favorite dishes: - Mediterranean platter, especially the eggplant dip - Veggie stir fry, which is technically a side, but really large enough to be a main  I had beef gyro both time and would thought it was good, but I would have preferred lamb.

Bland pizza.  Not particularly horrible nor particularly good.  Staff that cared more about what's playing on the tv screen than keeping the tables clean.  But a nice space otherwise.

The best thing about Cupcakes is the display case.  It's was a really neat copy of Sprinkle's style.  As for the cupcake itself, it was a cloyingly sweet frosting on a dry carrot cake.  Something I would have expected at my local Albertson.  Not really worth the drive or the $3.25 price tag.

Yay...another winning meal based on reviews from Yelpers.  Best Milanese ever.  I mistakenly thought that I'm not really into Torta.  But it just turned out that I haven't had a good one...until Los Reyes.  Now I'm a convert.

I'm a fan of humble pie.  But strictly for the pies cause I'm way too cheap to spend $7 for a side of fries.    I love the charred sourdough flavor of the crust here.  It's a great choice for when I don't have 2 hours to invest in waiting for Pizzeria Bianco or deal with the crazy parking at LGO.  One thing I don't get here is the olive oil gelato.  I'll take it on faith that they actually put a drop or two of olive oil in there, but I can't freaking taste it.

While not a full-on supermarket, Fresh & Easy fills most of my needs.  Good selection of cheeses at a good price, nice looking produces, some canned and frozer stuff for those lazy days (most days).  And easy pricing, plus their many coupons make this an easy choice on my wallet.

I've never wanted to move in (literally) to a public facility before.  D@$! this place is full of blings!  It was suppose to cost $10MM to build.  Finally, a place where I can go to sit on a Herman Miller Aeron chair for hours without menacing looks from pesky sales people.  Free wifi, coffee bar and yeah, lots of shinny new books.

One of those cute independent places that I wanted to give a great review to but ended up having a couple of issues.  While the gelato tasted okay, it  was just way too melty.  I was told that the gelato was  actually made elsewhere, so may be it melted during delivery.  Also they really shouldn't use the word "scoop" on the menu if they're not actually scooping.  When I ordered 2 scoops, I really thought I would get twice as much gelato as 1 scoop.  But it turn out to be a medium cup that was just a little bigger  than the small.   Hope that they work out all the kinks soon.

The sushi bar here just rock.  Second and third visit to  Sushi Roku, P made a bee line for the sushi bar.  That made all the difference.    First time here we sat at a booth and while the food was good, there wasn't anything to make me want to go out of my way to come back.  But the sushi bar just transform the experience.  The sushi chefs are friendly and willing to engage you and what's fresh and good.   I put my trust and their recommendation and left happy and satisfied.

I don't know about the rest of the menu, but their happy hour food is just an awesome deal.    I was there for the reverse happy hour (9pm-close).  So after an evening of working through dinner, I got the blacken fish taco plate which came with 2 substantial fish tacos, rice and black beans for just $4.95, that's cheaper my usual late night tacqueria and much tastier too!  Next time I'll be going for the $1.95 burger with fries.  Simple comfort food done well and at a great price...what more do you need?

Woohoo!  This is definitely as good as it gets for farmers' market around here.  McClendon dominates with a large corner space, and the long lines to prove it.  Maya farm also has a good presence.  But there were also two other small growers this morning, one of which has really good looking heirloom tomatoes.    The chocolate bread fromt he Phoenician hit my sweet spot straight on.  I also really liked the tomale stand with vegan option. Next time I'll try to check out the bbq man.   Now this is something worth getting up early on a Saturday for.

Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.   Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list.

Have heard good things about this place for months. Should have checked Yelp for latest before going and could have ducked the bullet that was chicken fried steak lunch.   John P's review said it all.  My lunch was institutional and canned tasting.  The "real" mash potato tasted like it could have been fake with a slick & sticky texture. May be breakfast would have been better.
