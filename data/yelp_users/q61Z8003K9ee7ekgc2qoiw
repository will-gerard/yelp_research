I'll tell ya what:  You have to go HERE if you have a Mercedes.  Honestly, one of the best, most reasonably priced shops I've ever dealt with.  You go inside and you will meet customers that have been going there literally for years and years.     I've never had a bad experience- just today they got the ignition switch fixed after I had to tow it in LAST NIGHT- yes, it involved undoing the steering column and using all kinds of nasty cutting tools to remove teh old switch (tumblers failed)  but they had it FIXED in less than 1/2 the day.    WOW.    Fast, accurate and best of all real good pricing....  PS- BUD is president of the local MBCA (benz club) so yes, he is a bit of a fanatic about these cars.

Read the perfect scores, this place is no joke.  I had my 2003 BMW Trans (ZF 5HP24) rebuilt here.    In summary, no matter how you cut it, there was no possible way to have it done at a better price, with professional courteous service and best of all, a warranty.  I got one heck of a deal on a quality rebuild backed by a national name.  Even had I bought a junkyard transmission, and paid for a drop in the pricing would've been close to what I paid for a fully rebuilt, guaranteed transmission.  Anything goes wrong?  No hassles.  You won't be disappointed in the service, pricing or quality.  I'm astonished, frankly-  never seen a scenario where it was actually CHEAPER to have them do it then to try to swap it myself- until now.  Best decision I ever made was to come to this shop for trans work.  Thanks to everyone at AAMCO.

"YOU MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT WE MEANT!! THERE IS A FEE FOR FOLLOWUP!!  /\/\/\/\-- Same thing as VW.  I read the review and went, figured if I got them to confirm actual costs a few times I wouldn't get zapped.  WRONG.  I went, got Logan checked out, bought $150 worth of meds and services, Vet assured me that "She won't charge for the 30 day checkup- it's a WEIGHT CHECK"  Went in 28 days later to weigh him (on my own)  confirmed AGAIN that the checkup I was scheduled for 2 days later was FREE  Went in for actual scheduled checkup, walked out since there was supposedly no charge, got a call saying I skipped out on $24.95.  I said I confirmed 3x the follow was supposed to be no charge and they pulled the "well that was WEIGHT check, for looking in his ears it's $24.95"  Not in the context of the first 3 conversations and confirmations I had.  Oh well, guess it's time for another Vet.  Hate that "billing mistake" crap and I'm not gonna subject myself to it.  PS --  am I off or when was the last time you had the VET ask for your SSN#?    If you guys at the ARK are reading this, all that info is bogus, I'm not giving you my SSN and personal info.  My credit cards and cash are all you need.  Sorry, but that's not your business to know.  rjp  EDIT: Answer to Becky below:  Becky, asking for my SSN isn't for "identification"- it's so you can blackmail and threaten customers with collections and ruined credit if they don't pay those sudden follow up fees you promised were free...  Nice try tho.

Fast!  Got my rig in today (had off center issues)  and now it drives perfect- again.  Came in under quote as well.  These guys actually DRIVE the car to make sure it's right before it goes back to the customer.  When was the last time you saw a McShop (like a worthless Goodyear store) do that?  rjp

WTF?  I have a 1.5 y/o macbook with a slightly loose hinge they wanted to send it to their depot and charge me $430 to fix it- saying they "will diagnose my computer"  The nice but young and inexperienced sales girl I heard her unzip her fly when she quoted me.  I laughed at her and told her even "at $100/hr their quote is completely fcked up" so NO, I'm not doing it.   I don't understand how she kept a straight face quoting that number, but whatever.  The place they referred me to in town did the fix in an hour and charged me $90.    APPLE: some of us can afford your product by NOT wasting money on inflated services.  Please remember that.

can those TV ads and that website be any more annoying?  They market to ADD sufferers.    Awful techno music on the TV just blares up when it plays (virtually useless - non informative TV ad) and their website has those annoying "live interactive" salespeople that tries to talk to you and you can't find any relevant info on your own.  Good luck finding the monthly fees on the website.  I gave up.  Not worth the hassle.  EDIT- good deal on membership once I showed up.   I feel like an ass now since I wrote bad review.  This place is pretty good compared to the local 24 Hour..  Cheap too.

Overall, not a bad experience.  I traded on a CPO 2016 STI.  I think the deal was good, but it was earned- rough and tumble, but not drawn out so no agony there.  Remember, do your homework, and walk if you just don't like the deal.  It'll be there tomorrow.    They do a decent job of standing behind their wares.  Usually you expect some monkeying around and to be blown off once you sign and are out the door, I had a few minor issues after the fact with cosmetics of the car and they stepped up.   I would do it again.  They kept their word, and that's all you can really ask for when buying cars, especially In a place like Las Vegas, NV, not exactly a bastion of civility, tasteful understatement or service excellence.    Also had two experiences with service- which is really the better half of the lot- once with old car (2016 WRX) they were courteous, and quick with handling the recall.  On the new car, there was an underbody panel that cracked and broke free (probably from a tow or someone not putting it back on after the oil change) they took care of it, immediately, putting me in front of the other vehicles.

I shipped an amplifier IN PIECES I bought off Ebay on a gamble- an old Fosgate P150 that I got cheap.  In pieces- many resistors and diodes simply cut out and in a baggie along with a million other bits and pieces.  They got the amp back together, and lo and behold out of the box it was PERFECT.  Frankly, I'm used to playing the back-and-forth game with places that say they fixed it but they didn't.  I honestly thought I might be hosed since the amp was in so many little pieces- I figured they'd either tell me to throw it away or never get it right.  These guys have their act together, if you have a dead car audio amp this is the place to ship it to.  I live in Las Vegas, NV FYI- other side of the country.  Excellent work.  Amp is in my truck doing what it was meant to do- play music and play music well.

Believe the Hype- read the other stories, mine is no different.  Great place to come to for a BMW / Benz.   Chris took good care of me when I came in with a leaky water pump- not only was it a great deal, Autohaus also took care of a few extra issues (that I knew of) at a price that was way less than expected.  They care enough about their work to ensure it was done right, and made sure I was completely put back in order.  It's just a good deal all around.  They have my business as long as I have my BMW and I"m here.  Thanks again for the great work!   rjp

being a Euro car owner for over 20 years, I've had experiences between good, bad and ugly I must say that finding this shop was the best thing that could've happened to me (currently) owning a BMW.  Being around the block a few times with these cars, I know a few things...  Devon (owner) is a hard working, honest guy who does his best for everyone,  I have never been disappointed in the service, the pricing or the quality of workmanship from this shop. He has a sterling reputation and believe me, he deserves it.  Read the other reviews, you don't get nailed and punished for owning a BMW by this shop.  They are beyond reasonable, and treat you like an intelligent adult, not a dummy with an open checkbook..  Las Vegas has a big shortage of reputable repair shops....As long as I'm in LV and own a BMW, this is where it's gonna go-End of story.    Southwest Bimmers is building a good business around sound practices and excellent customer service, they deserve the highest possible ratings here.  rjp

Lobby full of people waiting to see Dr Ryan- and no one bothers to come out to tell everyone they are TWO HOURS behind schedule.  I only found out how long the wait was when I overheard someone who got sick of waiting (less than I did) they were behind schedule   This place is run by dingbats and dumb little kids.  AVOID.
