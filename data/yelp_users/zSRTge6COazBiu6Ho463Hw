This place is excellent New Mexican cuisine! I especially love the new mexican potstickers and am obsessed with the cream sauce that it comes with! The lobster enchiladas are also to die for!!!

I came here for a slice this evening and I have never experienced worst customer service in my life than here (and I got out to eat every single day). I walked in and notices three old slices in the window and asked if they had anything fresh. The man rudely replied that they had fresh cheese and pepperoni in the back. I asked for a slice of cheese and watched him put the old slice of cheese in the oven so I promptly asked for the fresh slice. The woman working next to him said "this is fresh and has only been here 5 minutes. Do you want it or not?!?" I chose to believe her and said yes as I stepped aside to let a big party behind me order. After they finished, I watched the woman take out, the then burnt slice of cheese pizza, put it back in the window and asked me again what I wanted as if I had never ordered. I told them I would like a slice of cheese so she picked up the burnt slice and tried to put it back in the oven. I've never reviewed a single restaurant (good or bad) in my life, but this was bad enough to share to everyone. Owners who treat customers like this should not be allowed to run restaurants. Don't ever go here!!!!
