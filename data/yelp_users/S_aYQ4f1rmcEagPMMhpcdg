I can't help but order the Doughboy every time I'm at Cheese. Mmmm my fave! Yeah, they use an avocado spread rather than the real thing, but that's just the way it's made. It makes it all gooey and delicious. I like to add a sarsaparilla or iced tea, along with a tiny mac salad or potato salad side. It really doesn't get any better. (The Long Tall Texan is another family fave.)  The space is a blast from the past -- humble beginnings with personal family touches. The family owned and operated shop is clean and always welcoming. The clientele ranges from blue collared to white collared, high school kids to grandpas. You really can't get any local than this, people!  Every time I'm in the neighborhood, I have to stop in for lunch...or breakfast (tasty breakfast egg sandwiches). Cheese 'N Stuff is a real treat and never disappoints.

US Egg is one of my favorite "typical" breakfast places -- nothing fancy with standard breakfast foods. If you have a hankering for pancakes, you must have the protein and blueberry cakes! The skillets are very good as well. I like that the owners are always visible, and friendly. I definitely prefer a local spot over a chain, even if I have to wait a little longer for a table.

Another location is in North PHX on the north side of Bell Road just east of Cave Creek Road.  The most delicious Sonoran dogs in Phoenix! I love how they load 'em up--bacon, beans, mayonesa, onions, cotija cheese, yellow cheese, guac, salsa, (canned) mushrooms, jalape√±os--all on a soft, buttery bun. The service is ALWAYS super friendly and their tables are clean. You really can't beat the price... 2 dogs and 2 Mexican Cokes for under $10?! YES PLEASE.

Bleh! Coffee was all water with grounds at the bottom. The guy checking us out was rude. He also said the coffee was "supposed to taste like that." They don't have half & half--only fake creamer. Don't bother. Eat at Paradise Bakery before you go through security.

Been going here for years -- back when it was just a hot dog stand. Now it's a food truck with an extensive menu. I recommended the hot dogs, vampiros and street tacos. Delicious!!
