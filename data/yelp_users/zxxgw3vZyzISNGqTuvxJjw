I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :(

Never going here again and you shouldn't suport them either. The OWNER (blonde) was at the bar. We sat at the bar and didn't get a hello. Nor did we get menus. We sat for a few minutes before she slowly walked around to come wipe down the bar in front up each one of us without saying excuse me, hello, nothing. She went back behind the bar and continued cleaning glasses. Finally handed us 2 menus for 5 people. Still no hello. I had to ask a couple minutes later for a 3rd menu.....a couple of us just shared menus. About 5minutes later she walked over with a piece of paper and said "what are you guys gonna get?".....yeah, hello to you too. The first person ordered her beer and before she could even say what she wanted to eat the lady moved on to the next person. Normally this is okay but after almost 15 minutes of not being acknowledged I think we have had enough time to decide what we wanna eat.  So, this place's burgers are al a carte and I understand we should pay attention to the menu but it's almost unheard of that your burger comes with no side. So my friend got her burger and wondered where the fries where. She was informed she can buy fries for $4. Fine. But it should go without saying that when such a common item soo commonly comes w a side the waitress should explain while ordering that you can add a side if you like. the guy next to us had the same problem. So, tipped her 15% and i didn't wanna give her anything but my fiance used to work in restaurants and won't let me leave less than 15%. Anyways, as we were walking out my fiance gave her the benefit of the doubt to say goodbye and he told her "have a great night!". She didn't look, respond, nothing. We were invisible, all 5 of us, walking in and again walking out. Never going there again because I refuse to support someones success when the owner won't even greet customers. Horrible service. I'd give zero stars if I could but it's impossible. Plus the food is decent. Again, the al a carte thing isn't clear.

I love this place! I frequent it on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Though, I work during the week so sometimes I only make it on Saturday :( The club is pretty damn small, but they make extremely good use of it :) I love climing onto the carpeted bleachers. Makes me feel young! The co-ed bathrooms are a definite plus! Only because it's taboo and decorated like a gorgeous gothic nightmare. Also, because if you're a chick and feelin spontaneous, you can pee in the urinals! (not that I've done it....). The bartender, Bailey, is to die for!! I don't know if he's gay or straight but he gives the guys and girls equal special attention and he's absolutely gorgeous. Another plus to going there :) There's no cover on Wednesdays but there IS a $5 cover on Saturdays. Very worth the cover! Wednesdays is an Industrial/EBM/Goth night. I believe they have $3 vodka drinks all night on Wednesdays. The resident DJ Noize Fkr is amazing and extremely friendly. He was the resident DJ for Tranz :) He also DJs there on Saturdays, switching off with some other dude. Saturday's is "Retro and Beyond". It includes late 80s and early 90s of everything from pop to goth to industrial. I love dancing to Prince, then NIN, then Billy Idol! It's heaven for me :) They have drink specials til, I think, midnight on Saturdays...but not sure. Not to mention I know a grip of people so it's a nice place to arrive alone, if I must, and not fear I'll end up alone in a corner the whole night :) One more thing, there are some hidden Lounges behind the bleachers, in case you and a special someone feel like being naughty...or just being alone :)  I HEART sanctum!

this place is the best of the best of modern, macabre, alternative, dark, creepy, sexy, and beautifully put together in a wonderful little cove on 5th street, right off of Roosevelt. Perfect location. Friendly and passionate artists. Priceless art of all kinds. BUY BUY BUY!

The Tsoynamis are amazing!! you have to try one! *&^# Dairy queen and others alike! Vegan soft serve mixed with heeps of junk is the only way to go! Their brunch is also quite impressive. They always have a Tofu scramble and hash potatoes accompany your meals, but their meals themselves are quite impressive. I Love this place!

For being, basically, the only vegan restaurant in the downtown area, these people deserve 5/5. I've rarely had mishaps with my food and even when I do the food is still delicious. For being vegan, this place is the best of the best. The fries are a bit skinny for my liking but I still devour pleasingly them with the seasonings and ketchup and fake ranch provided. They now offer alcohol, which is a major plus for the demographic nearby. You have to try the wings. They are delectable, especially for carnivores. And the food is downright delicious. Make sure to check out Nami, next door, for their brunch on Sundays or their Tsoynamis any day of the week!

Overall, I give them 4/5 stars because they aren't top tier and the mimosas seem to get drowned by OJ 50% of the time but the service, environment, and food are ultimately impressive. I always have a good time here. No dissatisfaction with the food, as of yet. We always enjoy the food. The bottomless mimosas are $15 and this price should be lowered, in my opinion. But other than that, it's a stand up place that offers comparable prices with other restaurants nearby. The servers always provide great service, the food is always great (especially the sweet potato fries and Thai chili wings), and the environment provides a decent mid 20s to 30s crowd of decent human beings that you are likely to get into a conversation with. Not to mention, the pleasant live music provided on a daily basis.
