So, I Had The Chicken Yakisoba (Chow Mein) I was not impressed at all. Sadly as soon as I took my first bite I knew I wasted my money. Didn't have enough chicken and  the noodles were over cooked the flavor could have been better. Now I'm now saying the place was horrible that's why I gave it two stars not just one. The atmosphere wasn't great either that should have turned me away in the first place but I had a friend that was telling me how good this place was so I gave it a shot. I will not go back

Hand Down One Of The Worst Gyros I Have Had Not Sure If The People That Like This Place Have Had Other Gyros Before Or Not. I Tried A Lot Of Gyros In Other States And Other Countries Even And The Gryo Meat Here Is Not Good At All. I Honesty Didn't Want To Eat The Whole Thing.

I Had The Linguini RWB Shrimp and Mushroom. The Shrimp and Mushroom where good the Linguini had No flavor at all there was no sauce at all I guess It was my fault for not reading the whole thing I just assumed that it would have some kind of sauce but It's ok this was the Second Time I been here first time I was disappointed too I had the "No Bones Buffalo Chicken Breast"  and to be honest if it didn't cost 10 bucks I wouldn't ate as much at I did and I still didn't eat it all. My friends said the pizza was good, I had a slice I wasn't impressed.. But to say something nice and the reason I gave it two stars not one was the service was not and the atmosphere was nice too.

This is the type of place you want to keep coming back and trying other "Pasties" this has only been the second time I've been but will go back the first time I had the "Cajun Chicken" it was great this time I had the "Rosemary Chicken" and it was just ok not enough flavor and a little dry but it still was good and it didn't turn me of from this place at all. I will be back soon

So, I had there "Tacos De Pollo Cascabel, Ceviche, Tacos De Barbacoa, Flautas, Nachos Al Carbon and Crab Cakes"  Over all the food was Ok, nothing amazing but ok there's stuff that I would not order again but I couple that I might. The atmosphere and the services was real nice. There was nothing that stood out that makes me wanna come back to try it again so as far as coming back I might if I'm in the area for Happy Hour but I will not go out my way to come back

I normally never try to write a bad review but I had to for this place the only good thing i can say is the atmosphere was nice as far as the food as the service horrible. First the food I had the "Sportsman's Platter" witch is Fried shrimp, catfish, alligator and fries. The Alligator was over cooked and very salty almost not worth eating the Catfish had no flavor at all the Fries were cold and hard the Shrimp were the only the that I could eat without being mad at excluding the fact the there were only two of them. Now The Services if you can call it that saw 8 Waiters standing around talking had to wait over 15 minutes for someone to come and ask us if we needed refills on drinks and they were not busy at all there were only two tables with people in the whole place and we were one one the tables and when she did bring the drinks she forgot one and never came back. We had empty plates on our table for over 15 minutes and when she asked if we were done instead of grabbing the plates she grabbed two cups and again never came back had to ask for our check or I would never got it.

So, I had The Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas With Plantains and a Beef Pattie. The Jerk Chicken had a good spice to it. I've Been here a few times before this places is pretty good I like the Jerk Chicken I also had The Curry Chicken and The Curry Goat was not a big fan of the Curry Dishes and I do like Curry. But the Patties and the Jerk Chicken I do recommend. The only thing In my mind about this place that is a downer is the prices 12+ and I didn't get full other then that it's a good place to check out. I will good back again

Ok, First let me say I've never been a big fan of "The Cheesecake Factory" been a half a dozen times and the only reason was because my Girlfriend at the time liked it. So yesterday when my friends said let go I wasn't to keen on the idea but I said fine I'll give them one more chance.This time I went for Happy Hour so I only ordered appetizers. Chicken Pot Stickers, Chicken Sliders and the Fried Calamari. So here's what I thought I wasn't Impressed Nor Disappointed. The Pot Stickers had good flavor but were a little salty the Fried Calamari was good could have been cooked a little longer and the Chicken Sliders were good not a lot of flavor thou. If you beem here before you know they have a Great Atmosphere and the Service was good as while. Over all I might go back for Happy Hour but not in any rush. Hope This Helps

Been here a few time normally get the "Chile Verde Birdie Turkey" and it's always good this time I tried the "Philly Cheese Steak" with The Works. I enjoyed it at first I second guessed my order thinking most likely it wasn't good be that good but I was impressed it's wasn't like a Original Philly Cheese Steak the bread was different the meat also but it had great flavor. I also tried the "Goat Cheese Bruschetta" and that was amazing

So, I Order The "Side Fish Taco"  For 3 bucks, When it came I was like ok cool they give you a good amount for 3 buck so I asked "this is the side taco right" she said "yes that's why is doesn't come with rice or beans" They Where not good at all to be honest I didn't even them or take the rest to go and I very rarely leave food. So the bill came it was 12 bucks. So I said "I order the side for 3 dollars why is it 12 bucks" (Keep in mind I pointed at the menu and said my order twice to make sure She understood me.)  She said "O I thought you order something else" and what ever she thought I said wasn't even on the menu. So I will never go back to this place waist of money and time

So, I had #10: Tre-Tre - 2 drumsticks & waffle with a side of Fries. First let me say I been to the one In Phoenix a few times and this was my first time at the Scottsdale location and the Phoenix location I was not impressed at all you could tell the oil needed to be changed each time I went. Now on to the Scottsdale location, I was Very impressed food came out hot good flavor fresh. The atmosphere was nice, The service was just ok took them awhile to take our order and come back for refills but over all it was a good meal.

First off  I been here a lot but first time I wrote a review,  The Service was good. The atmosphere is really nice and the Food was just Ok I tried The "Gourmet Five Meat" Mini Pizza. The oven roasted ham made it to salty other then that it was Ok. Like I said I been here a lot but have not been awhile it seems like they're going down hill on the the food hints the reason why I don't go often.

So, I ordered Yellow Curry with Chicken & Cheese Rolls for an Appetizers. The Curry I ordered Mild and asked to give me some Chile paste on the side because I split it with a friend and she doesn't like spicy food. as soon as I saw it come out I could see it was spicy but I took it anyway. It was very spicy not overwhelming but not Mild at all. Other then the spice there was no real flavor to the curry. There was barely meat I know we split it but we both go like two small pieces. It kinda suck because I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now and now I'm not sure if I'll ever go back.. I doubt If I go back anytime soon

So, I had The Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas With Plantains And Cabbage. The Rice and Peas were the best thing about this place everything was was not good at all.  The Jerk Chicken had no flavor no heat at all and if you had Jerk Chicken you know it should be spicy. I had better places. This as my second time here I forgot the reason why I didn't go back now I know. Will not go back again

So I went yesterday with some friends for their 40th Anniversary. They had good deals going on pretty much 50% off of a few dishes So I had "Half Spaghetti With White Clam Sauce & Half Meat Sauce With A Meatball" The pasta was $3.95 the Meatball was $3.75 they say they give you two but its really only one that they cut in half. So to be honest even at Half price for the Pasta I felt like I paid to much Pasta was under cooked no flavor in the Meat Sauce the Clam Sauce was the worst I had took one bite sent it back. I understand it was their Anniversary and they had half of food so they didn't put there all into it but it wasn't busy at all so the the food should have not been under cooked. You would think knowing that people are gonna come you would want to entice them to come back. It was my first and last time going here sad to say.

So, I had the Gyro. It was ok not great but not horrible either the meat was soft the Pita was soft witch are good things, Now as far as The Tzatziki Sauce it was one of the worst I've had. No flavor it tasted and looked watered down. Looked like a watered down Ranch Dressing. I doubt if I'll ever go back again..Unless I'm really craving a Gyro and happen to be near there most likely I wont go back.

So I had the Hotlink Sandwich It wasn't bad I've had better It wasn't Hot really meaning the Temperature of the Meat and the Spicy of the Meat if it was hot in both ways it could have been better. It was sliced different also that not that big of a deal thou but it was different. Wasn't a big fan of the BBQ sauce either.

Wow, I'm Shocked how many people gave this place 5 Stars. They must not know what good wings or good fish taste like Or they work there and are putting up fake reviews.. The wings were not that bad not great but not bad. The fish I didn't want to eat the whole this way to salty no good favor just taste old and salty. For what you get I feel it's a little over priced but everywhere is getting to be like that. Will not go back again

So, I'm not trying to be funny when I say this But I wish I could have gave this place  Zero Stars. As far as the Service it wasn't that great but l i'll give them the benefit of the doubt since its new and they have Teens working up front. It was my first time going there so I wish she told me I could have a flavor crust she told the two people after me thou. And one of them got there Pizza before me not sure how that happen The pizza wasn't good at all to be honest but  $5.00 Large 1 topping pizza  you can't expect Greatness but I do expect better then that. Now on to the Philly Cheesesteak Hands down one of the worst Cheesesteaks I've had if not the worst. I had the Philly Cheesesteak  with Grilled onions and Cheese Sauce. There was not one good thing about it, The bread was nasty and hard, there wasn't enough meat, Not sure if it was the Cheese or the Meat but it was was very salty. Its over priced also 7 bucks for a 8"in.. If was just want a Cheap pizza and don't care about taste I'll say got for it. But do not waste your money on the Philly Cheesesteak

So, Let Me first say this I tried all The Martinis they have including the ones they took off the menu and the new ones they added last week And I'm a fan of them all excluding the ones with chocolate just because I'm not a chocolate fan but I still tried them just to say I did LOL. As far as the food I tried the Meatballs they were Ok nothing amazing but ok. I will come back for sure.

So, I had the "3 Piece Fried Fish & Fries " Ok let me first off say this. I debated for a long time on giving this place a One Star or a Two Star. So they call it "Fish" on the menu they don't say what kind it is so I asked them he said "Catfish" I honestly think it's "Swai Fish".  Swai Fish is another  white fish that similar  to Catfish but taste a little different. But when food is fried it's hard to tell the difference between the two especially if you don't eat fish a lot. So I honestly think they don't put the name of the fish on the menu so they wont get in trouble for false advertising. But anyway on to the Taste of the fish. It had no real favor in the cornmeal it had a little salt but no real favor. The fries were cold and given the fact that you have to wait 7plus minutes for them to cook the fish you would think you would get fresh fries too. The one positive thing I will say about this place is the services was nice & very friendly. I really doubt if I would go back.

So, I Had The Steak Sha-Wirma. It was horrible.. Really horrible. Very Dry, Not A Good Flavor At All. Even The Garlic Sauce They Have With It Didn't Help. I Took 3 Bites Had To Toss The Rest In The Trash. A Waste Of $7 bucks. Also Had The Chicken Gyro Here Before & The Regular Gyro. The Chicken Was Not Go Either Would Not Get It Again The Regular Gyro Was Ok, But If You Come Here I Would Say Away From The Steak Sha-Wirma & The Chicken Gyro.
