My review can be summed up by the letter I mailed to the owner.  Personal names have been blacked out because I'm not totally horrible.  RE: Bootzer, male Chihuahua  Dear Dr. ******,  I have been a client of your location since I moved to Phoenix in 2004. Your facility has cared for two of my dogs, Bootzer and Mattie. However, I will no longer be bringing my pets to Alta Vista.  The reason for this letter is to inform you of my disappointment in your staff. On numerous occasions I brought Bootzer in for a consistent, honking cough. Each time your staff would test him for something new; such as Valley Fever or Kennel Cough and each time, after paying around $300 for a specialized test, we would be told our dog was healthy and just needed to shed a little weight.  On our last visit we met with **** ******. **** examined Bootzer and did not perform any tests, rather he suggested a prescription weight loss food and then tried to up sell us on flea baths and preventative de-worming. He had no explanations for Bootzer's cough except that he was overweight and small dogs often breath in dust and it could be a response to that.  On July 13th my husband and I had to euthanize our beloved Bootzer due to his trachea collapsing. The emergency hospital we took him to was extremely knowledgeable and knew right away what was causing his distress. After speaking with the veterinarian we learned that collapsed trachea is a common problem with small dogs, and Chihuahuas are a high risk for this problem and its not uncommon for this to be a hereditary issue. We were also informed that the cough and his lack of being able to exercise should have been a significant sign to any experienced, professional veterinarian. This could have been treated earlier with medication, a harness instead of a collar and putting a humidifier near his crate.  As you can expect, my family is very saddened by the loss of our friend and frustrated that not only could this have been prevented, but that we could have improved the quality of his life while he was with us.  I will be informing the public of my disappointment in Alta Vista via word of mouth and review sites like Kudzu.com and Yelp.com. I will also be contacting your receptionist to have Mattie's records transferred to a more reputable vet.  I don't know how much money we have invested in your clinic to date, but I'm confident that we spent too much - considering that the real issue was never diagnosed, tested for or addressed. I don't see you considering compensating us for our loss or the money we spent with your organization, but I want to voice my displeasure in losing a family member due to a lack of caring, negligence and incompetence.

Love Wag n Wash!    The owner was SO helpful when we went in to get new harnesses and leads for our pups.  He helped us find the best options for us then actually spent the time to fit our dogs personally.   I had been researching "the best" healthy dog food and I was very pleased that they carried the line.    Very impressed with the toy, accessories and food options and AMAZING customer service!

They dropped off menus at my company and I thought it looked yummy.  Got a group together and ordered for delivery.  Over an hour later, food had not arrived.  I called and checked to confirm that they had actually placed our order.  The man confirmed that our order was on it's way and there is construction in the area that may have slowed the driver down.  He said he would contact his driver and then call me back with at ETA.  15 min later, still no food and still no call back with an ETA.  Having coworkers raz me about starving, I called and canceled the order.  During they phone call they were not apologetic and said "Well I couldn't call you back with an ETA because I can't find my driver."  Awful service.  I can't even review the food because it never came.

Based on other reviews I read on Yelp I decided to try Paulene nails since it's closer to my home then my usual nail place.  It was a disappointing experience.   Minimal colors to choose from.  The hot rock massage was nothing spectacular and seriously only lasted 35 seconds on each leg.   While I was getting my nails filled the lady was very rough -- cutting into my cuticles on numerous fingers.  It is cheap.  This is a place where you get what you pay for.

Recently ate here with a bunch of girlfriends. Though we had reservations we still had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated. The appetizers were great -- I loved the baked goat cheese and the flat bread but I think I could have stopped the meal there. For dinner I had the French Onion burger and it was just Meh. For a $13 burger I expect more then Meh. Also the service was terribly S-L-O-W. Soooo slow. If I wouldn't have enjoyed my company I would have gouged my eyes out with a spoon. Unless my friends insist on it -- I won't be returning.

Went to the Firehouse for the first time today on my lunch break.  Very friendly staff, quick service and YUMMY subs!  Because the sandwiches are steamed they are sooo soft and juicy.  They totally don't skip on the meat, though I would have enjoyed extra veggies.  I will for sure go back again.

My husband and I just had a wonderful "staycation" at Xona Resort Suites.  We stayed in a King Size suite.  The living room was spacious, complete kitchen (including glasses and silverware!) The bed was comfy and the decor was hip and modern.  Bathroom was very small and they could definitely provide better shampoo/conditioner.   We did have a problem with our first room's A.C. not working but as soon as we called the front desk they quickly transferred us to a nearby room.  Loved the options of 4 different pools.   The adult pool was fabulous - besides the music that was targeted at the 50-60 year demographic.  Bring your i-pod.  They do offer kid movies at one of the pools each night which is a nice option if you have children and want them out of your hair for a couple hours.    We enjoyed happy hour  in their lounge, which included free appetizers, then dinner at  restaurant.  The service was fabulous!  The food was pretty good but it's not somewhere I would go to enjoy if I wasn't a guest there.    Overall I was very satisfied with our stay and the service we received.  We were able to relax and forget that we were only 20 minutes away from home!

I heart MoJo Yogurt!  It's sooooo yummy!  I love the selection of toppings and I think it's great how you are charged on the weight of your yogurt, so really you can get as little or as much as you want!   My fave is Skinny Strawberry piled high with lots of fruit!  YUM!

I was very happy with my visit to Oliver & Annie.  Though it is small the items that are carried are so healthy and the prices are very reasonable.  My main compliment goes to the owner.  He was so nice and helpful.  I also LOVE how many products he carries that when purchased they go straight back to charities.    This is small business with a wonderful business model.  I will continue to visit and support Oliver & Annie!

Love SuTra Midtown Yoga!  The studio is gorgeous and completely relaxing. The classes are unique and fun.  The staff has always been friendly and it seems they really want to know the yoga-goers and support downtown Phoenix.  I'm looking forward to taking many more classes there!

Awful.  Horrible haunted house experience.  Expensive.  The actors didn't even try.  There even was a guy in the middle of the dark tunnel telling you how to get out safely.  There wasn't even the classic scary ending with a guy and a chain saw chasing you.  It was completely underwhelming.
