I wish there was a way to give them zero stars!!! The customer service is horrible!! They are rude and talk down to their customers!! Don't waste your money coming here go somewhere else!!!!

Horrible horrible customer service! They have one person working early morning and she moves slower than a snail! She hates her job and it shows! She talks down to people she trains.. Starbucks is known for their great customer service and she doesn't have what it takes!

I drove 30 minutes to get a tan, and the girl tells me that since I have my daughter with me she can't allow me to get a tan! Horrible customer service!!! I've brought my daughter with me before and it was never an issue!!! I will be canceling my membership!
