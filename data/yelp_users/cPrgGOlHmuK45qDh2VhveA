My fiancé took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.  We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.  My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite!   What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!

My fiancé and I had great experiences with The Right Touch yesterday.   I scheduled massages for both of us at the same time for a Sunday afternoon. He opted for the Deep Tissue Massage with Traci and I had the Therapeutic Massage with Kelly. It had been a log overdue treatment for me and Kelly was AMAZING. She was gentle yet firm in areas that needed to be worked through and my body felt like butter after it was over. I was also pleasantly surprised that she asked me if I wanted the oil removed from my body. Yes, please! She spent an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning me off with a hot towel and even that process was gentle and massage-like. We will definitely return again soon!

I recently got married out of the country, and in preparation for leaving for my wedding I had to make all my "get prettied up" appointments for 6 days before the big day. I had never had a shellac mani or pedi so I was excited to get something that was going to last through my week.   When I got to Applause the girl that worked with me informed me that there was a misprint in the Groupon I purchased, and the deal only covered a shellac mani but a regular pedicure. I explained that the shellac pedi was the reason I purchased the deal and because this was for my wedding, they needed to honor the deal, so they very kindly worked with me.   My overall experience was mediocre. I basically got my nails polished, but my skin was really, really dry, and my girl didn't even bother to moisturize them. No hand or foot massage either. Isn't that a requirement? It really was as basic as you can get. While the polish didn't chip as advertised, it started peeling at the top as my nail grew and the the polish separated from my cuticles. As for the pedi, the toes were not looking great after a few days. The polish was touching the cuticle and sure enough they peeled faster than my fingernails.   Needless to say it wasn't as picture perfect as I had hoped, thus will not be returning to Applause for any of their nail services in the future.

Harrison shot our engagement session last month and we couldn't be happier with our photos. He has a keen eye for the photojournalistic style we were looking for, which was a top priority in my search for a photographer. The shoot was fun, relaxed, and natural. We brought our dog for the first half of the shoot and Harrison even captured some amazing, frame-worthy portraits of her by herself. She quietly stole our show!  Price-wise, Harrison fit right into our budget. I was looking for a photographer that was willing to give us the digital files of our photos. He charges an additional fee for this, but the total cost was still less than what I would have paid other photographers for just the engagement shoot. One photographer quoted me more than double for the same package, so Harrison's pricing was very fair, in my opinion.   We are planning on having another photographer shoot our wedding overseas, but had we arranged for a local wedding, I would have loved Harrison to shoot for us again. When the time comes, I will be knocking on Harrison's door again for family portraits!

This review should have been written a LONG time ago, but we were holding off in hopes that Treeline would finish the work they started in November 2012.  We initially met with Treeline's then owner, Odean Ortega, who drew up our plans and really left no room to budge with the budget. A job well done on his part if I'd say so. We spent almost $8000 for his crew to redo our front and backyard with new plants and some hardscaping. The company transferred the project to their contracted project manager Mark Banderett who oversaw the work, which took about 5 days to complete. They left a few things unfinished including painting a stucco wall which needed 2 weeks to cure, and a few other things like adding stabilizer to the decomposed granite in our patio.   Fast forward 2 months, Mark finally returned to address the odd jobs. We were charged some more money for other things that we requested (fine by us), but when I wrote the check to Treeline, Mark told us to write a new one directly to him instead. He explained, "I'm doing this on my own to save you money." He collected his money and neglected to complete the work. Text after text, he repeatedly gave me excuses for not showing up, pushing me off to later dates, blah, blah, his aunt died, and then he just stopped returning my calls.  I called Treeline MANY times and explained our unique situation to their office manager, Paula. When Odean finally reached out to us, he came and evaluated the work that still needed to be done, and he said he would send out some guys to finish everything since the original work in our contract from almost a year prior still hadn't been complete.   Then, nothing. He never came back.  I called the office again. Now they have a new owner, James. He personally came out to take a look at our yard, not to DO anything, just to look. Several weeks later he returned. At this point our irrigation system in the front yard was not operating, he claimed our timer had broken. He sent us a quote to replace it, and another quote for Treeline to come by weekly to maintain our property, you know, to "protect our investment." We gasped at the ridiculousness of their quote to replace our timer: $400. And the maintenance: $200/month. ABSURD.   My husband replaced our sprinkler timer for $50. Turns out that was never the problem. We called our neighbor's maintenance guy to see if he could get our sprinklers to work and he fixed whatever was wrong for free. BOOM.   We regret every penny we spent with Treeline and their contractor Mark. You will too. I promise.  Goodbye Treeline.

We are looking to do some improvements to our front and back yard and Joseph was kind enough to come take a look at our property last week. He gave me some great suggestions including installing artificial turf in the back yard while covering and extending our less-than-desirable cement slab patio with pavers and a firepit. After discussing the plans with my better half we decided that we would prefer using more modern materials than pavers and keeping the grass natural. I sent Joseph an extensive email with some inspiration photos and an illustration of my new vision for the yard and followed up with a voicemail to make sure he received it and hear his thoughts. Joseph has yet to respond a week later, and that leads me to believe he won't be calling anytime soon. Whether he has the resources and ability to do the work on our yard or not, I would have appreciated a reply. I guess my business is going elsewhere...  I'm probably being generous with 2 stars honestly, but I suppose he earned the extra star for meeting with me and proposing the work.

I went to Tortoise & Hare Sports on Friday night to pick up my team's race packets for Saturday's Color Me Rad run. I live in Central Phoenix, so this location is faaaaar for me, but after a friendly neighbor recommended it, I was happy to make the trek up to Glendale and check the place out. Plus, I was in need of new running shoes - how convenient!   My experience at Tortoise & Hare Sports was fantastic. Nathan, the owner, found me a great pair of shoes and inserts after evaluating my feet and my natural foot strike. He whipped out his handy iPad and recorded my foot strike running away and towards back him while outside, determining that the shoes were a good fit, preventing any pronation that I would otherwise have.    I have to say Nathan got it right with his knowledge, experience, and top notch customer service. He was kind throughout the process and I never felt any pressure to spend. The only drawback for me was the distance. Maybe he'll be open to expanding into Central Phoenix in the near future... ;)
