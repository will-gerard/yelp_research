I recently was in the market for a cruiser, but being that I am very tall, this is not the easiest task.  Mary and the great folks at Bike Barn helped me to identify two separate 'tall' models of Electra bikes.  The one I originally decided on actually didn't fit me as well as I'd thought it would, but even after they had to special order it, they took the bike back and we exchanged it for the other option.  They exhibited phenomenal customer service and were a pleasure to do business with.  You have a long-term customer for sure, Bike Barn!  Thank you.

I have purchased 2 vehicles from World Motors, and they have earned my business long-term.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  I was able to get exactly what I was looking for at a great price, with no hassle.  They have the best deals in town, even better than private party sellers.  Highly recommended.

I can understand why Pete's Fish & Chips is a Phoenix area staple and has such a loyal following.  I'd heard nothing but rave reviews and finally decided to see what the hype was all about.    When getting a quick bite to eat, I typically don't care about how a drive-through or restaurant looks from the outside, much less notice or remember much about it.  Pete's was different, in that they clearly have paid a lot of attention to detail not only making sure the food is great, but the overall experience is enjoyable as well.  Everything I saw was well-kept, and as driving around the restaurant, there was a sea-themed mural on the wall with all of the different Pete's locations within the painting.   It's good to know I can get my Pete's fix, regardless of where in the Valley I am.    They were quick- I only waited a short time for my food, and as expected, it was excellent.  I ordered the #2 Super Seafood Combo:  Two piece fish with seven shrimp, fries and a drink and #4 Chicken Tender combo:  Four piece chicken, fries and a drink (this wasn't all for me).  It's amazing how much great food you can get at Pete's for a few bucks!  I can't leave out the sauce.   I'm not sure what they put in it, but it's some of the best sauce I've had anywhere.  It would be good on anything. It's just the right  amount of sweet, tangy, and spicy.    All in all, Pete's was a great experience and I will definitely be back.  Keep up the great work, Pete's!

I've been to countless chiropractors over the last 15 years or so.  Dr. Judge at The Joint Scottsdale Lincoln Village is by far the best I've been to and he has my business for the long term.  Dr. Judge is always able to easily uncover any issues I may be having, and correct them.  For years, I'd walk around in pain much of the time. Since making regular visits to Dr. Judge, I've been basically pain-free, and it's easy to drop by The Joint a few times a month for preventative maintenance.    Not only is Dr. Judge an excellent chiropractor, but he's a great guy and always a pleasure to talk to.  I couldn't be more pleased with my experience at this location of The Joint.

Tri-City Pool is the best in the business.  My only regret in working with Ty at Tri-City is not having found him sooner.  I had had a number of negative experiences with other pool service companies- mostly not showing up, or saying one thing and doing another.  Working with Ty has been a breath of fresh air.  He is always professional, on time, courteous and always open to answering my questions.  He has also been very patient and explains things in thorough detail, as I am still learning about my new pool equipment.  I highly recommend Tri-City Pool Service if you want honesty, integrity, and excellent service.

I am personally very specific (likely obsessive) about all things A/V, and when remodeling our home, I knew that if done right, it would be my favorite part of the house.  After doing a significant amount of research into multiple local A/V and home automation companies, Randazzo's was the clear choice.  My first impression of Randazzo's Home Systems was great.  The owner, Steve, showed up promptly at our scheduled time (where others had not), was professional, courteous, clearly knowledgeable, and took the time to answer all of my questions in detail.  What really stood out to me was the fact that Steve designed a system around exactly what I described to him, and did not recommend or quote me on items/components that were not needed or overkill (as others had).  Steve was clearly vested and interested not only in delivering a great looking and sounding system, based on exactly what my family and I wanted, but his continued service long after installation has been phenomenal.  The finished product exceeded my already high expectations, and we constantly receive complements from house guests on how great our system is and on functions they didn't realize were even possible.  We could not be happier with our A/V system from Randazzo's Home Systems.

They have an F rating with the Better Business Bureau.   The only reason I used them is because Spencer's uses them for warranty service.  In hindsight, I'd rather have paid a good company than these guys do it for free.  Their customer service is an absolute joke.  The people they have answering the phones and scheduling appointments are rude, incompetent and could not care less.  Furthermore, you have to agree to be available for a three hour window for your appointment.  It's frustrating they can't be more precise than three hours, but I know must utility companies do this as well and I know some jobs take longer than others, etc.  I came home from work during my time and didn't hear from the repair man so I called to check.  He said he would be about an hour.  This was fine, it was still in the window.  I went to get some lunch, came back in about 30 minutes, and he never showed up at all. He told the main office that I had cancelled on him and needed to reschedule.  This is entirely untrue, and beyond that, I had to miss over three hours of my work day, reschedule meetings, etc. to wait for this guy.  They rescheduled me for Saturday morning.  I got a call today (Saturday) from the repair guy saying he would be here between 1-4 PM.  This experience has been awful.  Don't use this company.

I hadn't been in a few years, when they were in Scottsdale at Fashion Square.  I'm glad I came back, and will be back soon.  The location is much better, and fitting; as this place is way too cool and independent for the mall.  Jessica, the sales person who helped me, was awesome, and her customer service was some of the best I've ever had.  She was high-energy, fun to talk to, and listened to exactly what I was looking for.  Then, she immediately brought me about 8 solid options. This is no easy feat, as I am very tall and I'm picky as well, so it's usually hard to find jeans I like.  Jessica made it easy- and she clearly loves what she does, which made it a cool experience.  She knew and gave me a detailed backstory on all of the brands; how, when, where, why and by whom they were started, the process certain jeans go through vs. others, raw, selvedge, Japanese, slubby, etc.  I could probably give a 30 minute presentation on the jeans I bought yesterday, based on the knowledge Jessica dropped on me.  Thanks again, Jessica and The HUB!  I'm sold.
