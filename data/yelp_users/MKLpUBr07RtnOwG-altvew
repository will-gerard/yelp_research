Why did I even come here, this is a big ass tourist trap to begin with and I knew it, I have been to the one in Time's Square for Peet's sake, the beer were expensive, I had the wings and it was barely tolerable as it didn't really have a real flavor to them.  The only decent things were the service, the big screen TVs with sports on them (this is ESPN Zone after all) and free wi-fi, so supposedly you can do work.  Just skip this place there are far better places to enjoy a game while in Vegas.

Kobe burger done medium with swiss and a side of sweet potato fries and a cold beer or two for lunch.  What else do you want for lunch?  Even lunch during the week there was a line for groups, so go with a group no more than 4 to avoid the wait (isn't it always 4), there is also a long bar that you can grab a seat at.  The decor: think traditional diner turn the lights down, and throw some wood in place of shiny stuff.  The burger came out quickly and done right.  There are several chef burgers for you to choose from but than you can select your bun, your patty of choice, cheese, and any condiment you want.  But think carefully, for me: kobe beef so I went with the swiss because it is lighter in taste but salty and cheesy still, its a kobe buger so don't even think about putting some crazy topping that will overpower the meat.  I digress, the service was prompt, the burger was great, the sweet potato fries were good, the beers were cold.  Yeah, I will be back.

Tons of ups and downs during my 2 night stay during the week when I was in town for work.  Vegas during the middle of week is full of conventioneers, conferences, and old people. Well the Palms had its share of older folks or the folks that you won't see typically drop $$$ at the tables but hey it was still nice crowd overall.   Valet was on-point every time except I couldn't call down because of the phone somewhere.  When I checked-in they upgraded my room to deluxe rooms on some really high floor of the Fantasy Tower while paying the basic rate.  Down to the casino floor, the vibe was "alive" or as much as it could be for during the week in the middle of winter, the Palms always play great music throughout the casino floor which makes it great because during long stretches at the table you can feel something besides the stack of chips in front of you dwelling down.

Don't let the fact that this place is inside the Paris Casino fool you.  My Friend Gabi, you were so delish.  Paris Casino has dropped from its prime, if it ever was on same level as the other major properties so you wouldn't expect the food at this place to be at such a high level.  Since the wait was crazy long for outdoor seating, I opted for sitting inside which was fine because it reminded me of the autumn brunches and afternoons I had in Paris, very traditional decor inside with dark rich colors.  The tables here just like in Paris are crammed together.  The service was great, I had the plate du jour, which was a Meatloaf Sandwich, this is a classic French Bistro so the bread they give you was incredible enough, and the bread for the sandwich did not disappoint either.  The meat in the sandwich was yummy, but it was rather petite, the fries that accompanied the sandwich was a disappoint though.  They were crispy but too thin for me, and this is a French bistro so why are you offering me ketchup?  I had to ask for mayo, and out comes this big-ass gravy boat of mayo, they didn't have any small sauces cups or something.  Besides the size the mayo tasted like homemade, French people love mayo to the point that they will make their own, and this is not home-made.  Oh I had a drink which was okay too, really decent price, good joint, MAKE RESERVATIONS (online or phone), sit outside unless it is sweltering and enjoy.

I am more of a lounge guy, so this is a good spot for me, you can pre-party with a view.  Decent amount of seating or leaning space, it was hopping couple of years ago, not as popular but still great views.

I have only been here for drinks, they have some happy hour specials because cheaper boozes is always good.  The drinks are pretty good and the service was not bad.  The decor feels very traditional European with the colors and the trimmings.  It is right by the pool so you can have sit inside or out while enjoying your drink and food.

Go and get your drink on, they got a cute view thing going on outside, the bar feels small and quaint although it is in the nexus of several of the top restaurants at the Wynn.  The Acai Kiwi drink is packed with vitamin C, so keep telling yourself you are doing yourself a favor and you are not downing more booze.  This place sure has attitude, if you have a need to have a fancy cocktail, which we all do about once a day than take the parasol down and have a drink.

It was later in the evening when even the Vegas dinner crowd was thinning away, I found a seat at the bar and ordered up my favorite bourbon, Booker's on the rocks.  The service overall was good, and I had the salmon because I just had steak several days ago and guess what the salmon was really good.  A really good sear was on the salmon that caramelized the exterior while it is juicy on the inside, yummm.  The sides however jusy okay, the overall experience was okay.  It was super trendy in there, all for a steak? It is Vegas after.

This place is off the strip a bit, but worth it if you are jiving for some crawfish and you live on the wrong side of the dixon-mason line.  This place is located in a small strip mall like many others in the Asian part of town, keep driving past the Pho shops and the Chinese restaurants and you are here.  This is not your "traditional" crawfish, it keeps a lot of the traditional flavors but throws in some Southeast Asian flair.  I got the two pounder of crawfish, got couple of beers,  rolled up my sleeves literally but the bip and went to town on those bad boys.  I go the Hot and Spicy and it was the right about of heat in it for me, if you know what the jucieness from the head of the crawfish tastes like than you know what I am talking about, tons of shrimp like flavor juices with the spices, and since this reciepe has tons of butter it creates a layer that stays on the shell which ups the calories, cholesterol, and saturated fat but takes the flavor up too.  The corn was a bit overdone though, the potato was good but only two little pieces.  This gets me a bit because corn and potato are cheap but tasty bits and yet they skimp on it.  Everything was good besides the corn and potato.  They should have a sign that tells you what the market price is before you order because $12.99/lb??

This place should be great judging from the reviews, prices should be reasonable since it is slightly off-strip, sort of in convention-land.  The prices were a little higher than I was expecting but hey when in Vegas live it up.  I had the Samurai Special with Prawns, my steak to be medium-rare.  The salad that came with it was decisively not fresh, eh what is the point of stale greens.  The steak came out medium well, and the shrimp was a bit on the dry side, the meat was covered with garlic almost to the point of taking away from the flavor of the meat.  The service was the only thing that was okay, otherwise there are plenty of other spots around that would worth the hard fought money you took away from the casinos.

This place was highly recommended to me and as an American I was naive, I walked in on a Friday night after drinks and appetizers with some friends.  And load and behold there was a seat at the bar no wait, elbow to elbow with a local with her cycling helmet and a gentlemen dressed in a finely tailored suit.  And I am wearing a shorts and a t-shirt (us Americans are so horrible at dressing up while on vacation.  The service overall was really good, traditionally trained bartenders dishing out fine wines and suggestions for diners.  This place is straight up traditional, with the right food, service, and ambiance.  For me I had a glass of red wine and the duck confit salad, I am not normally a salad kind of guy, but I did not regret getting the salad.  The duck was seasoned well, the meat was moist, the greens were fresh (this is the end of August by the way) and the balance of the bitters and the sweets of the greens and the sweet meat was on point.  This is one salad I would eat again, but there are so many other great things on the menu if I was to go here again.

This is the best smoked meat sandwich in Montreal, albeit I only ate at 3 different establishments in my weekend in Montreal.  The sandwich here was noticeably better, the meat was not only juicy but flavorful, you can taste the essence and not just the meat.  I have being told that this place always has a line, the combination of time honored restaurant, small establishment and yummy sandwich tends to do it.  There is a place to the left that does their to-go and catering orders, so if you are ok with sitting on a stoop and eating your sandwich that one will save you the wait.

I came here on an early Friday night while on a day drinking adventure in the area.  I can say that this place could be awesome because the vibe I got.  The particular day I was here St Laurent was closed so plenty of tables were setup outside, and people were really laid back.  Pretty decent beer selection, not knowing much of the beer culture in the area I was corrected and the bartender highly suggested I get another which I gladly drank.  This place reminds me of a bar I spent a lot of time in college, the plus side of this place was the restroom was clean.

Great downtown spot, great customer service and open later for late owls like myself.    First meal in Montreal and I order the large smoked sandwich, I was going to order it with a poutine appetizer but the bartender kindly told me to just switch the fries to poutine instead and it was a wish choice because the amount of food was enough to feed two people.  The sandwich was massive, the smoked meat was really good, the overall experience of the sandwich was really good.  The poutine was ok, not that flavorful.  They have beers too, so the experience was really good, a ittle pricey yes but overall a great meal.

Stepped in here on a Sunday for an early lunch before riding the bus back to the airport, this place just so happens to be near the airport bus stop in the area.  This place served beer, food and had TVs with sports on, I am an American male, these things should satisfy me.  I ordered a beer, a burger with poutine on the side and sat back. The beer was ok, price was kind of high but I am in downtown, the burger came next and so did the disappointment.  The burger and fries both tasted like frozen commercialized food that was thrown on the grill and the fries were just dropped into the fryer without regard to temperature, and crispness.  The poutine tasted like it was from canned gravy that had being warmed up.  Overall for the location and price you can totally do better somewhere else.

Very nicely organized with biking lanes, walking paths and entertainment spaces and green spaces.  Walk or bike along the waterfront and enjoy the view, as a tourist this place is nice to see how clean and organize it is.    Plenty to see and do here, if I more time I would get some take-out, and a bixy bike and enjoy this area a little more.

Thought it was cheesy to come here before but it ended up being pretty cool.  Another of the tourist must stops in Edinburgh if you are a tourist, stuff that ranged from the cheesy to "they were doing stuff like this back than?".  This place has free wifi so if you are backpacking through Europe you can still check-in on yelp or facebook with your friends.  This place is a place to act like a kid again with a group of people to get the best effect, otherwise the pictures you get won't be as cool.  This place is a bit pricey and could do better with some newer stuff but remember to act like you were a kid again and do so on sugary drinks to maximize the effect of running around making faces.

Frankenstein memorabilia everywhere inside, looks like a church on the outside, check.  Have beers on tap with loud music on, check.  This is definitely a place for you to stop by and have a beer and take a look around, even once.  This place is unique and one of a kind.  First came here on a pub crawl one night, and we came back the next day for a later afternoon beer just to make sure it wasn't just weird when I have had a couple of drinks already.

You come to Edinburgh and don't come here if you are a tourist? If you grew up here you probably came here once when you were a kid avoided the place because it is full of tourist.  But since I was visiting as a tourist I came to check this place out.  The Castle dominates the surrounding area with great views of the city, it is a little pricey to get in but I think it has a number of well curated museums if you are into history and in particular military history.  There are the rolls for a number of wars/battles for the fallen, and each of the Scottish Military Regiments have their Regimental museums here too.  The are aplenty so bring a camera with lots of memory, a jacket and a bottle of water.

I walked by it one day and was like this place looks awesome and actually later that day I was with a walking tour and we stopped there.  Really great customer service, and the Espresso Macchiato was really good too, I bet this place makes you smile when you walk in on a cold, wet day.  I could see myself being a regular if I lived nearby.

Just stayed here for a week for work in the area, they handled my group's last minute reservation, and all of us were very satisfied with the service and the hotel.  The property is fairly new and so are the amenities, the locations of the elevators are a bit tricky because there is no central location off the main lobby except they are on either sides of the hotel.  The hotel staff was very friendly.  The only compliant I have was when the housekeeper came to my room I was still working on my laptop and I asked her to come back a little later and she never did.  I would take my work down to the lobby but I couldn't VPN for work unless I was wired access.  The breakfast was decent, the morning fruit salad was weird but different.  The complementary evening reception was decent except the two beer limit, we had to resort to having my co-workers give us their beers.  My GPS couldn't locate this place but it is located next to the wal-mart off happy valley so you can just point it there and you can probably see it from the street.  Because it is so close to the two strip malls in off happy valley you can walk to food or its a short drive.  Which is great when traveling for week or two at a time and all you want to do is grab a bite to eat and relax with a movie.    Overall, great stay I would stay here again next time I m in town.

Every Sandeman New Europe Tour operation is a classy act, and this one is no different.  The free walking tour was great, full of knowledge, the tour guides welcome your challenging questions and takes you to the nooks and cranny that most tours don't.    The pub crawl was basically pays for itself with all of the free drinks and drink specials but be warned if you drink every drink special and have a drink at every location you will be feeling it by the last stop.    The Ghost tour was well done, but it was more of a bloody journey of Edinburgh, still fun though since it comes with a free drink at the end of the tour.  You will be walking up Calton Hill so bring your walking shoes.  If you plan of doing the Ghost tour and the Pub Crawl, buy the combo ticket, you save money and know what you are doing for two nights you are in town.

One of those touristy things you have to do in Edinburgh, and since it is free even backpackers can enjoy the wonderful views.  The walk up is not hard, but wearing actual shoes will make it more enjoyable.  You should walk up once during the day so you can poke around and take the scenic pictures, bring a lunch with a date and enjoy the views. But come back again at night for city skyline at night with your date for some QT.  Oh and besides the view there are monuments to snap up pics during the day.

Call it a hipster bar, or a old-school tavern, but the mustaches and uniforms make me say hipster bar, but the great thing about hipster bars is that they make awesome drinks.  The down part is that they never have a TV to watch while you drink.  I had a Hendricks and Tonic, they really balanced the unique flavor of Hendricks Gin with their homemade tonic superbly.  Their pimms cup was different not like the ones I have had in the UK but it was still pretty good.    I came back two nights later to have couple of drinks and those two were really superb as well.  Not 5 stars because there was no TVs.

Super legit tacos, and burritos. Tacos are straight street taco style = they are small.  I originally came in to grab some tacos, you can order a 5 pack and don't have to stick to one or two meats.  The tacos were on point, meat had plenty of flavor to them, the salsa bar was solid.  I was so happy with the tacos, I had to take a burrito back to go because they don't sell beer here.  This is what every neighborhood, not just city should have.

Retro-American Diner with attitude and class.  This place has all the classics like burgers, meatloaf, and pot pie, but I was really hungry so I went straight for the prime rib, the big boy cut.    Let's back up a bit, this place looks really classy, we are in downtown YUL by the way.  The decor is super modern with a retro flair and this attitude falls into the food as well.  When you first walk in there is a bar to your left that shows off the drinks available and the bartenders that are ready to deal out some drinks.  Now back to the food, the prime rib entree was large, like really big.  Normal humans should split this meal if you are getting the larger cut or you have your next meal waiting for you.  The prime rib was prepared, pink and slightly red in the middle, the outside had a slight crust/bark on it and it was heavenly.  The drinks expertly prepared by the awesome bartenders were on point as well.  The only downside of this place is walking out of there a little poorer than I walked in.

I had brown-bag lunch with a friend here because it is close to where she worked and the hotel I was staying at.  Even at lunch on a Friday in late August it seem really well kept, with lots of people enjoying the last of the sun and grass.  Kids were running around and hardly noticed any trash, only a handful of the usual drunk people.    If I worked around there I would be brown-bagging it too because how nice it is.

Stopped here during the St Laureant street faire, and we needed some drinks in the middle of the afternoon.  I never turn away from drinks, especially in the afternoons and suggested by two locals.  They had plastic tables and chairs setup outside so people can enjoy the weather, this was end of August by the way, the nice server brought us our pitcher of drinks and we were never hassled.  We drank until we were content.  Sorry no food this time, maybe I should be back one day .

City BEACH in Montreal !!! And it is free by the way.  They have an area for getting your drink on.  They have chairs and umbrellas, throw in a free bathroom you can BYOB.  The sand is high grain, fine white sand that they truck in so it will get in everything so dress accordingly, ie, sandals.  I was there Friday afternoon in August when the weather was perfect and it was not crowded at all, people stopping by to sit and chat for a bit after work.  They just need water access and it will be complete

I was brought here by some friends who a MLS match, I didn't know what to expect since I am a big Chinese guy and they decided to sit right next to the Ultras, haha, what could go wrong right?  The stadium itself is of newer construction and reminds me of a large minor-league baseball stadium.  By they have all your needs, parking, right next to a metro line for public transport, food and beer stands.  They have a beer guy that keeps selling beer until the final whistle, which is cool and dangerous.  The fans were really cool, lots of energy, the seats were right on the edge of the stadium and it was easy in and easy out even when the stadium was sold-out.  You are so close to the stadium but there is only one jumbotron and no other screens like in other stadiums.  But great vibe overall though.

5-star luxury accommodations with a doorman, concierge, bell-hop and the receptionist kind of give you a weird look when you come in here with a backpacking bag, like I did.  But the service here is first-class nonetheless when they realized that I did have reservations.  The lobby area and parts of the hotel were newly renovated and it shows, I personally think they went a little overboard in modernizing the lobby area instead of keeping the original layout.  I always request the basic room for one when traveling on my own dime, it is my hard earned cash by the way but being a Diamond member does have its perks like being upgraded to a nicer room, a room with a direct view of Edinburgh Castle on the top floor.  The hotel room had all the luxury items you would think a place like this would have: robes, tea set, coffee, HDTV and etc.  The room I got was really big by any standard, with a large desk to work, two chairs to sit and sip the complimentary wine and enjoy the chocolate.  Since there was no executive lounge they provide free drink vouchers which I didn't get to use over the 2 nights I was in town.  And at night feel safe as both times as I m getting out of a taxi at 2-3am they made me show my room key to even enter the hotel.

I have being to the original Humble Pie location downtown and i was eager for a quick pie to go at the airport.  I am use to airport pricing, so I was okay with price point, the pie turned out pretty good, the crust was slightly too burnt, but the pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  My biggest compliant was my wait, I ordered my pie, than went to the restroom came back and saw the customer in front of me just get her pie, I waited patiently and saw that there were several pies in the oven going.  Than 6+ pies came out, all these were from customers who ordered after me, a set of 6+ pies went in and as they were coming out I didn't see mine's, I asked the guy baking and he didn't see my name on the tickets for the pies.  So about 12+ pizzas came out before mine's did, no this isn't an airport where people are in a hurry to catch their flights or anything important like that.
