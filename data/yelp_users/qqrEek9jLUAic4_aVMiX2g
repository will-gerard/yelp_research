I can't recall a group business dinner anywhere that was better - 50 People - $8,000.00 and very good service and food.  If you have an event coming up ask for the Library, Wine Cellar or the Board Room  (and you have to visit) - we had too many people to use these rooms but our guests were treated like friends by Lon's and the food incredible - little touches of greatness that clients told us about weeks after the event was concluded.  I am in Scottsdale again in January and plan to make a dinner reservation this week. Thanks everyone at Lons!

Ring Ring - Hello reservation for four please, overlooking the mountains and the golf course please. We have room for four but not on the course side. OK well thanks for 6:30 please.  I wanted to see Rancho Manana and look at the condo's here for sale for a 2nd place. Never got to see the property.   When we arrived - we were seated at the window against the outside wall just not in the tent that was set up outside. Perfect - Hello I am Mary and I will look after you. Wine list yes please (I shouted - it had been a long week). Then I saw that my dear friends were not going to order wine as the wife has been battling cancer since 2003 and the drugs and wine - well you get it. Then Mary saw this on Lorene's face and her cancer wig too and with that before I could even say a thing Mary said - why don't we save our wine money for a couple great desserts. As she grabbed for the wine list, Mary lingered a second longer asking about the specials but also squeezed my shoulder communicating that she understood. The rest of the evening she was on auto-waitress mode. Every bit of her energy went into this table and into delighting Lorene and Kevin too.   Had Mary noticed Lorene had to wear cotton gloves because of the sensitivity in her fingers from the cancer drugs. Something happened as Mary shifted gears and gave even more of herself subtly. Our cute Long Island native, Mary suggested the best things on the menu - even telling us what was off and on from the specials board that would work or not. She was accurate with every detail so I asked her to just pick for me and with a couple questions about beef or fish, salad and veggies she picked my meal - Kevin ordered the same thing.  All of our food was wonderful, incredible grouper - a favorite of mine - just right pasta too. I guessed that the kitchen staff was in on Mary's Make-A-Wish like plot too. The GM would bounce over to our table and check on us ever so politely. By now Mary had endeared herself to us and she was graciously caring for our friends.   Then dessert (instead of wine) time came - we opted to split something - the girls picked with Mary's help. When it arrived it was huge and Mary was beaming. The check arrived - but the desserts were x'ed-out as a zero charge.  Thanks Mary - you were an angel and so were your chefs as you gave unlimited comfort to Lorene. Lorene never looked like that she was being patronized just enjoyed the evening.  We normally go to Lon's at Hermosa but this worked so well. We will be back again to eat with you everytime we are in from Houston. Now about that condo overlooking the for t-box...

Always a favorite spot, last night the Cantina Laredo Fajita's for four were charged as if for 8 server couldn't fix the bill! Then the meat was reheated cold meat since it was late. It was a critically ill friends birthday - and I didnt not want to make a big deal? Boycott!

Prep visit for the annual IECA fall conference - deal with great people all over this property.  Frank Idris - Director of Resort Operations, Shana Teal, Front Desk Management and the wonderful Denesye in Concierge and Guest Services. Marriott's finest phone staff -  Nilay Munoz and Rene Brietske in central reservations were crisp and professional too.  This is a wonderful property with a brilliant staff.  Thank you.

Fish and Chips in the dessert - this cheezy place is incredible.  Sign me up!  $8.00 and I close my eyes and I am in Northern Scotland at Banchory Lodge. My first trip here I sit with an Arizona Senator and his family. NO CREDIT CARDS - all outdoor seating and barrios neighbors but still, well done.
