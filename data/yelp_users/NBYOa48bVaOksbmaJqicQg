I'm Great Dane's new neighbor across the street at Xavier Home. I can't figure out what's better, the chili dogs or talking with Tony. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, trust me I've had most of it. I highly recommend it, tell em Joe sent you.

I've never had a bad time at the Windsor! I eat a lot of different things there but the porkwhich is stupid good. If you like pork and you like sandwiches and you like a little bit of a mess eat this sandwich because any time you throw a little coleslaw and a little honey mustard on pork I'm in but they got it just right! That was a really long sentence but I had to get it all out. If you really want to have your mind blown maybe add a  number 17 cocktail on the rocks and substitute the fries for Joe's potatoes, just sayin...

Sweet Barbacoa pork. I mean what else do I have to say I just said sweet Barbacoa pork. Shredded chicken good, steak good, grilled chicken good, but sweet Barbacoa pork...  There's also Vanilla Coke and mango lime limeade so...

"Thanks so much for being a loyal customer and almost filling up your punch card but oh sorry, we don't care about that anymore and do take those".   Me: does this kids quesadilla meal come with more than just disgusting looking orange?  Cashier: Nope!  Menu: kids quesadilla comes with drink, chips and choice of rice or beans...  Might be kinda over this place since last time they also accused my mother of stealing a drink even though he was the guy who handed her a printed cup instead of a water cup.... Oh and by the way she was drinking water in the printed cup!

I don't know why anyone would ever come back here? I'm so confused how they stay in business. I ordered a Sourdough Melt that looks really good on the menu with a few layers of meat but it's a burnt sandwich and the cheese is literally thicker than the meat. I took it back and they stood by it saying their meat is pretty thin. She offered to make me another one but if there was nothing wrong with the first one in their eyes why would I want another one? Worst sandwich I've ever had. Will never come back. Not offered something else or a refund...

I mean I own the joint but I love this place! I am here 24/7 it seems like but it doesn't feel like my job feels like my home. I love it here. I love making you stuff , I love rearranging the place so it looks different every time you come in, I love the customers. It's a great place to be. We feel very welcome in this neighborhood and we're happy to be here!
