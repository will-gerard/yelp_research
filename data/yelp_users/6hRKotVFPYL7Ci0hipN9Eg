I'm always in the mood for rice bowls, I guess you can call me a rice bowl connoisseur, so I decided today to try The Blue Fin. I decided to start the meal with an order of Inari Tofu Pockets and follow that by a vegetable bowl with brown rice and tofu. Service was very quick and the place was spotless. When my food arrived, I was extremely impressed. The inari pockets were large enough to be a meal on their own! I thought the inari were absolutely delicious and ate all three. The bowl was packed with vegetables and for $1 extra I got a TON of tofu in the bowl, perhaps the whole block! I left feeling stuffed and guilty (because I ate so much food). Good food here!

I need to update my review of Blue Fin. This place absolutely rocks; that's probably why you can find me eating lunch here 4 out of 5 weekdays, seriously. I haven't ever had a bad experience here after finding this gem and cannot speak higher of everything about they provide. Service, quality and freshness of food, as well as value, cannot be found elsewhere.

Los Olivos definitely takes the cake when it comes to car washes for me. Even though I live about 15 minutes away, I always bring my car here at least once a week to be bathed. The wash is cheap, well done and bonus that they are perpetually friendly. If you want a sub par wash that uses brushes and the employees couldn't give a crap about you, please, frequent the other 'cheapy places' closer to you.

I really enjoy That's A Wrap... all of the food I've ordered here has been really enjoyable, plus it's all a really good value for the money. My favorite wrap here is the Prince of Thai, sin pollo con tofu. The Veggie Bowl is also another good option and I'm pleased they can make anything vegetarian. Worth a stop for lunch, however, the parking lot is tight and I have been here more than once when it was full.

I really enjoy wandering around the gardens so much so that I became a member recently and since then have been back almost on a daily basis. My love affair first began when I went to see the Chihuly exhibit at sunset this past spring. I'm kind of glad that the exhibit is gone now because you can actually walk around and look at the specimens without the large crowds. Although the Chihuly piece by the main entrance is still there, it is debated whether it will remain a permanent installation. I highly recommend the DBG to all.

Ajo Al's, I don't know why I keep coming back to you. Perhaps it's because I've eaten at the 90th Street location since I was a pre-teen. I've had good experiences and horrible; guess this is a trait at all Al's locations.  This is the second time that I've visited this location, last time being a year ago and the food was ok. This time the food was mas o menos. We ordered Sangria, however, the sangria served was unlike any other I've had. The server told us it consisted of watermelon juice, brandy and he couldn't remember what else. No wine in sangria? Hmm... Anyways, the appetizer of guacamole was great with a lot of garlic and lime to it; the entrees, at least mine, was downright nasty. I ordered the Garden Fajitas light oil, to be served Garden Fajitas swimming in oil. So much oil I think that by consuming my entree it might serve as a laxative as well as a meal. I didn't eat the fajitas, or the rice because I'm sure it contained chicken broth. On the bright side the Mushroom Enchilada I had was good. Now I know why I visit Al's on an annual basis, if that.

Copenhagen rocks. I had the pleasure of stopping by the store about a dozen or so times over the past few weeks to redo my entryway and living room, top to bottom, and could not be more pleased. Of course I spent way too much money, but the selection and quality of furniture they have is quite impressive. I actually prefer this store to the North Scottsdale one, as I found the service and prices to be better.

I really love this store and the computers, iPods, iPhones, as well as the accessories that I have purchased for them at this location. The staff is extremely personable and helpful when they aren't tied up with others. The only gripe that I have is that sometimes the store, especially on weekends or nights, can be a zoo and all associates are often tied up. Bonus that I only need to hand them my credit card, with no other information, and I'm out the door with my receipt emailed to me.

I am a member of all Village Clubs and when I can't make it to Gainey, I'll occasionally drop in here since I have the multi-club membership. This club is immaculate. Love that they have two restaurants, equipment is gorgeous/new and it's relatively Centrally located in Phoenix. IMHO I think there are a couple of minor issues to this club but I think it's probably due to my lack of experience here and I need to adjust to this particular locations specifics. The cardio area can become very busy and you might have to wait for a machine because this location doesn't have as many machines as Gainey. The men's locker is gorgeous, but I feel like I need a map or GPS because it is so sprawling and I often have gotten lost. Bonus for the full bar, you can consume all the calories you burnt off at the full bar! Besides my slight criticism, this gym is awesome. Group activities, often that are free, yoga, etc. Love The Village!!

After stopping by here several times to buy bread on Sunday, because Pane Bianco is closed, I had the opportunity to have breakfast here several times; amazing food and grocery area. Very glad they have a complimentary valet these days but seating can be chaotic. Love the strawberry brioche, pizza, and daybreaker sammie sans meat!  Buy the reuseable cups for cheap iced tea refills which are necessary in PHX during the hot summers.

Baker is my first go-to place when I'm looking to add to my gardens. Tons of natives, cacti, herbs and etc fill their property & I can always find what I need. They also have experts and some special shows on occasion which are very interesting to see.

I love Yelp cause I can share my many experiences with you and the world. So today, in desperate need of a margarita, I decided to stop here with a couple of friends for a pitcher and some guacamole. After a few margaritas, I found their "healthy" menu and decided to order their  "vegan" veggie burrito. Problem was there was nothing vegan about it. After several bites of the burrito, I found a large piece of burnt steak inside. NASTY! If that wasn't enough, after consuming nearly half of the black beans it was served with, I found pieces of pork in the beans. That explains why they were so salty. I presented all of this to the manager who was kind enough to take most of everything, minus the booze, off of the bill. Revolting.

Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.  I have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered "Traditional Vegetarian", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the "Traditional Vegetarian". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.  Please, if you want pizza, do not come here.

Sassy Glasses rocks- seriously! Stopped by about a week ago to check out their selection of frames and was totally blown away! They have a very large collection of frames and styles that you will not find elsewhere. I found an absolutely gorgeous pair of glasses and they were ready in about a week, which was sooner than expected! The staff is totally friendly and I have a feeling that this will be the only place where I purchase my eyewear from now on. I don't think that they take insurance but hey, if you want originality you're going to pay a little.

Aqua Touch is one of the few retailers that I frequent to stock and replenish my salt water system. I go here because the store is always impeccable, they have an incredible selection of fish/coral/inverts that are always good looking, healthy and priced reasonably. I come here to stock up on pre-mixed water and frozen fish food. Aqua Touch I am a big fan!

I heard about Capriotti's from my partner who discovered them while in Las Vegas for work; decided to try them out several months ago. The sandwiches are very good, and when I ate meat, I enjoyed the Bobbie.  However, since becoming vegetarian almost one year ago, I hadn't had the opportunity to dine here again. That was until I discovered they have vegetarian options! I returned a few days ago for lunch and sampled the veg turkey sub as well as the veg cheesesteak sub. Both were pretty good; I really enjoyed my lunch. The cheesesteak was ordered with mushrooms and was full of cheesy-oniony-peppery goodness but I think I preferred the veg turkey sandwich for its simplicity. Worth a shot if you happen to be in this part of Chandler. (Note- they do cook the veg cheesesteak on the same grill that they cook their real meat on, be forewarned if this bothers you.. although it clearly states this on the menu. Request if they can cook it on a freshly cleaned, different part of the grill.)

Wow. This dealership rocks! I've purchased 6 cars in the last 10 years; the last two have been from Audi North Scottsdale. These people seriously know how to take care of their customers and I guess thats why I keep returning to buy new cars. Today I  happily purchased my second Audi and highly recommend that if you stop by that you ask for Brian McCauley. He is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and you will not be disappointed with your experience!

After a long hiatus from yelping here I go for the first time in a long time... Welcome back to yelpdom; I had to express my feelings about the gyms! I joined The Village after two friends recommendations and love all the clubs, especially the Gainey location because of the staff, crowd, cleanliness, lack of children and  quietness. Equipment is clean, new and where else can you get your drink on, lunch, hair and nails done and Botox all in one place on the same visit. Yoga studio is awesome, totally chill with great instrructors and they are adding a Bikram/hot yoga studio space upstairs now which I cannot wait for. Cooking demos and private parties rock. Men's locker couldn't be more meticulous, clean clean clean. Goodbye LA Fitness and Tocasierra at the Hilton Squaw Peak, I'll be spending my three hours a day working out here, TYVM ;) OH! and they sell Men's lululemon athletica in the spa area so I can always find new outfits to buy and wear pre/post workout! The Village clubs rock! Best gyms in Phoenix guaranteed. :]

I nominate The Lunch Bag as one of the most delicious, quickest and cheapest sandwiches in and around Mountain View/ Via Linda area. Everything that I've had here was delicious and fresh, bonus points for delivering in the local area! When I ate meat, my standard was their turkey, bacon and pepperoncini on toasted sourdough, but their veggie sandwich is very god as well. So easy to fax in the order and either pick your order up or have it delivered. I miss working in the area and having TLB as a tasty lunch!

OK, so it started with my desire to get a pair of snake bites forever so one day while having brunch at St Francis, I yelped piercing and chose Halo based upon other Yelpers experiences. Thank you I am now in love with Halo! I have been to Halo twice now for my body modifications and this is now where I will only go to from now on. My first experience was with Jeremiah who couldn't have been more professional and painless. He explained the process, what he was doing and schooled me in cleaning, aftercare and what to expect afterwards with the 16g snake bites. My partner also got his nipples pierced at the same time and agreed that it was a great experience. My latest experience was with Ana, who helped me when I stopped in because I lost part of my lip jewelry in the shower. When I inquired about ear spacing, again, she was a wealth of knowledge and quite the Kiwi character. I couldn't resist so I let her pierce both ears with 8g plugs, painless and again another great experience. Halo stocks tons of cool jewelry, extremely clean (aseptic, they use an autoclave I believe on all of their equipment) and I have never seen so many glove changes during the process. You need to check them out! What to get next?

I was really excited to find out that there was a vegetarian option across the street from my college.  However, I have had several bad experiences with the restaurant. I have attempted to eat here twice when they were closed. One time when I did catch them while they were open, they were out of the main ingredient in the dish I wanted to order, asparagus. So, on the fourth try, I was successful at ordering what I wanted and they were actually open. Unfortunately, the price soured my mouth. I think that at $20 dollar each for a veggie stir fry and purple shoots is absolutely insane. Picture it, two scoops of rice with various vegetables. $20 each? It wasn't even as if it was a LARGE serving. I'd skip Persian Garden and go to Mu Shu grill on the other corner; it's much less pricey.

Lalibela, you are my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the Valley. I travel to you from Sunnyslope as often as I can. Everything you serve (vegetarian) is delicious, and I often think of your food. Consistently delicious and satisfying you are. You have never disappointed me; this is why you are one of my favorite places that I will never turn down if offered.

Go to Green... it's delicious! No, it isn't low-fat or low-calorie, so I have taken that to consideration and indulge in their food every now and then. Everything I have had (or sampled) is wonderful... with the exception of the egglessrolls. While very large, they were kinda bland with too much wrapper. I definitely preferred the crab puffs over the egglessrolls anyday. Good iced tea and decent iced chai, too. Worth the stop if eating your way through Phoenix being vegetarian/vegan.

While not the absolute best Thai in town, I really enjoyed my dinner tonight at Thai Basil. I read about the possible wait, and at 5:30 I was able to choose any table I wanted. Inside it is very clean, small but cute. We started off the meal with Crispy Sweet Potato and it was good... I wish my dining partner would have wanted the Spring Rolls though. She ordered the Sweet and Sour Beef, while I ordered the Vegetarian Green Curry with Tofu, Vegetarian Fried Rice and Vegetarian Pad Thai. Everything I had was delicious... and my dining partner enjoyed the vegetarian fare I ordered too. The only thing that I can note is that when I ordered "Thai Hot", I got a dish that was medium to mild, no sweating issues for me. Definitely worth a visit if eating your way Thai around town.

Solid Thai; like other reviewers, they can REALLY increase the level of their heat especially if ordered dishes to be Thai Hot. Unlike my previous review, I consider TB to be one of the better in town and have been back numerous times.

Appliance Express rocks. When I called my home warranty company to request service on my Electrolux range, they scheduled service with Appliance Express which was able to come out the next day! Score! Anyways, the technician was clean professional and truly caring, which was a surprise for me. He was nice enough to show me how to reset the problem in case it ever occurred again. Highly recommended!

Not that PB needs another review, or that mine will do justice, but PB is wonderfully amazing. Everything I've had here is TO DIE FOR and is definitely worth the wait. Nothing like going next door to Bar Bianco and polishing off a few bottles of wine before feasting on the best pizza I'll have this lifetime! Seriously people, wait. It's SO worth it.

Tried SBG last weekend for brunch and have been thinking about that meal ever since. Two words come to mind: absolutely delicious. Started off with an agua fresca (pineapple-mint), an iced tea and the mini quesadillas. The quesadillas were a fabulous start to the meal; followed that with the veggie omelet. OMG that thing was huge! Inside there was a delicious mix of calabacitas, veggies and cheese. The veggie hash that was served alongside was a great compliment. My dining partner had the huevos rancheros and loved it as it wasn't served the traditional way. SBG uses fried tortillas as the base and loads them up with eggs, guac, etc. making a sort of "huevos tostada" so to speak. Anyways, definitely worth checking out sometime if you haven't stopped in yet!

Eden's Grill has to be one of my favorite, and newly discovered Middle Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant in the PHX metro. Located in a sleepy strip mall, close to Artie's Ace, is EG. My partner and I had the opportunity to have dinner here a few weeks ago and we were totally wowed by everything! We started off with the hummus, followed by two orders of the vegetarian plate. The vegetarian plates were huge and featured dolmades, falafel, rice, veggie skewers and veggie patties (2). The vegetarian plate was massive and everything on the plate was delicious. Next time we'll pay the extra $5 and split one Vegetarian Plate instead of getting two. The pita and hummus were fresh and delicious, however, I find EG's hummus to be a a little thick for my preference and they use a heavy dose of tahini in their hummus. Overall, I would totally recommend EG to anyone with an itch for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food but be warned, they aren't open for lunch on the weekends yet.

I really am a fan of Kashman's Place, unfortunately I don't live in the neighborhood anymore or I'd probably make it a daily stop.  I swear that they have some of the best bagels that I've had in the valley- their jalapeno bagel hits the spot! So does their bagel sandwich for a quick on the run meal. I was also a big fan of and can recommend the Thanksgiving Cranberry Turkey and Sonoran Chicken sandwiches. Everything that I've had at either location was top-notch... if only they had a CenPho location.

Took my mom here this morning for Mother's Day (yes, I know, Mother's Day was yesterday but mom wanted to celebrate today) and thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. Mom got the apple pancake and I decided to skip my usual go-to dish (veggie omelet) and try the veggie hash. It was really tasty and seriously filled me up all damn day! Instead of poached eggs on top, I opted for scrambled egg whites. Mom loved her apple pancake, stating that it had significantly more apples than what she normally gets at the OPH. She claimed that it was only slightly inferior to the one she normally gets at the OPH but was still highly impressed. My only complaint was that the wait time on the apple pancake was about 30 minutes, when in reality ours came out about in about an hour.

I have to completely agree with Justin about the quality of food from Number 1 Brothers; it was one of the worst pizza experiences I've had.. and I gave them two chances. The 'cheez' is nasty and it seems like all of the toppings are either canned or jarred. Avoid!

Unfortunately, I've spent too much time in the office of Dr.s Mary Ann and Terry Works office because of my own neglect. However, after receiving referrals, and all the work I have had, I can say they provide first-class service to their patients and their teeth. They have straightened, sealed, filled and cleaned my teeth; all the time and expense was worth it. The office is immaculate, staff professional and friendly, so overall they deserve a 5 star rating.

Sunday brunch with live jazz and drinks are the best in Phoenix! Love the bakers boards, fingerling potatoes, and an order of the fritatta, egg whites only no cheese extra veggies. The space is amazing; so is the food and drink. You need to try out their Sunday brunch! ;)

Lemongrass left me underwhelmed. I had high hopes reading the reviews on Yelp, I decided to try this restaurant with a friend of mine. We got there early and ordered a ton of food (this was confirmed by the server telling us it was too much). What we had was ok, the crispy sweet potato was very good (how can you mess up something fried) but when we got the "vegetarian" Papaya Salad, it tasted too much like fish sauce. My Vegetarian Green Curry was nothing memorable and was barely Thai Hot. The fried rice was acceptable and not too greasy, a plus for me, but the Vegetarian Pad Thai was sickeningly sweet. I don't know if we went on a bad night, but for close to $80.00 (including another entree which I didn't sample and don't recall), I would head elsewhere.

This place is a gem. Absolutely everything I've tasted here was delicious, from the iced jasmine tea to the main entrees. I'm glad to have another vegetarian/vegan restaurant option of this caliber in town.  We started off the meal with the Fresh Summer Rolls, followed by the Lotus Salad, an order of Stir Fried Noodles and the Kung Pao Soy Chicken. The rolls were large and quite filling on their own. Next, we split an order of Lotus Salad; with fresh squeezed lime on top it was divine. Crisp, crunchy and cool... perfect for a summer lunch. The Stir Fried Noodles were very good too, but the real standout was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken... I couldn't stop eating it! We finished everything and I was very satisfied. The interior is immaculate and service is very friendly. I will definitely be adding this restaurant to my rotation of favorites...

Pizza A Metro you were my favorite to-go pizzeria until last night. I have had great pizza from here and thought that this would be a delight to please me for a long time. You are very close to my college and I thought  I'd be bringing your food home on a weekly basis after class until last night. The pizza is good, however, my calzone was not as described. It looked wonderful, and the menu lists its ingredients as ricotta, mozzarella, peas, mushroom and tomato, but mine came with prosciutto. A lot of prosciutto. I don't eat animals (maybe this would be a plus if you are a carnivore). For me this ruined the meal. While crispy and delicious looking on the outside, one cut into it, and a watery, meaty mess fell out. My margherita and vegetarian pizza (as described on the menu) were sans meat.. why was there meat in this?  I thought I had a solid thing to look forward to, but will be putting you on the back burner for a while. Oh well.

Covet rocks! Ever since Salon Jo El relocated here I've been hooked. At Covet you can get your hair cut, colored and styled and shop at the same time, which is what I always do. Not only looking fabulous, I leave with the trendiest clothes and shoes every month. Hard to find fashions abound here; Randy is so friendly. If you're going for your hair, please request Cassie! She rocks!

I'm so glad the Organic Cleaners are in my new neck of the woods. I used to use them up at Desert Ridge and was fooled a couple of times by other "Organic Cleaners" when I stopped in with my express bag to their surprise. Anyways, I find them friendly, fast and affordable and have never had anything but perfectly cleaned and pressed clothes. Thank you, Organic Cleaners!

My first complaint is that I think the name is too similar to Real Food Daily in West Hollywood and I am always confusing the two names. Secondly, while I liked the food, I thought it was overpriced for what we got. Started off with the hummus, split an order of the curried cauliflower soup and veg. caesar salad and then had the green tea soba noodles with added tofu. Everything was very good; I really liked sitting on the outdoor patio with the exception of other diners dogs getting loose and trying to say "hello" to me while I ate. I'll be back again!

I've avoided yelping this place for a reason; that reason is that it sucks just as badly as their other location in the Hilton Village. The food is horrible, the  diners are mostly douches and although this location features less popped collars than the one in SDL I cannot figure out for the life of me why certain people and bloggers can claim this as some of the best pizza in the Valley. Sub-par food, service and experience in both locations.

I'm pretty much a fan of any Pita Jungle.. but especially this newer Desert Ridge location for two reasons. First, it is only about a 10 or so minute drive up the 51 to this Pita Jungle from CenPho with little traffic during non-rush hours. Secondly, the tables are HUGE which is a big plus for me, considering that the tables at other PJ's are cramped and pushed together. They seem to be ironing out the flaws in the food and the space is really beautiful. Pita Jungle is perfect, as always, for a fast, quick and healthy meal.

I have been to this Mojo fro yo location several times now and really enjoy their yogurts! The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)

Luci's is a totally cool new space and idea in the shopping plaza on the NWC of Bethany Home & 16th Street. I'm really happy with what they have done with the place and they have a great idea going. Only problem is that they might need to expand with it. I walked in expecting more of a small grocer/cafe but found it to be mostly a nutritional supplement store with slim pickins. The prepared foods section is scary tiny, with only one vegetarian option. The grocery section is tiny and reminds me of some sort of mash up between Sprouts/Healthy Habit/Cost Plus. Overall an interesting place and idea but needs to improve the selection/variety of specialty grocery goods and pre-prepared foods.

I had the great opportunity of meeting up for lunch here today around noon and was pleasantly satisfied! Last time I was in this space it had an Asian theme but they've redone it and it looks super. To eat we started off with two iced teas, an order of the guac, two veggie tacos, a veggie torta and I had the ensalada de la casa. Everything was fantastic; the veggie tacos are a steal at two dollars! I could have probably eaten 10-15 of them! The torta was delicious too and had the same marinated seasonal veggie mix between telera bread. My salad was light and refreshing, although it could have been a little larger. Props to all the friendly staff and to our competent server who went out of her way to make sure everything was to our liking. She inquired about our food preferences, told her we were vegetarian, and impressed us by actually understanding what ingredients are veggie friendly. Can't wait to try breakfast and drinks here in the future!

I have to say that I really enjoyed my experience last night dining at the parlor. The space is ultra-chic and was very well redone. I was impressed just by walking up to the entrance from the parking lot. The food was delicious; we started off by sharing the cauliflower gratinata. It was very good. We then followed that up by splitting a 12" margherita pizza, a small parlor insalata (without salami) and a small farm greens salad (minus the chicken). The pizza had a good mouth-feel and was somewhat more airy than AJ's pizza. My dining partners only gripe was that the wine menu could have used descriptions of the wine. Overall was really impressed with the Parlor and can imagine that it would be in my regular rotation, especially for happy hour!

I have been a member of LA Fitness since 2007 and the Camelback location isn't much better than the Northern location, although I hear they are completely rebuilding Northern. Every time that I would work out at Camelback, the equipment was busy/taken and I would have to alter my workout routine which I am dedicated to. So, after having to use random machines and messing up my workout routine, I decided to use the Tatum facility. Not much better. Very dirty, busy; people watching? It's a gross meat market. I want a workout, not to be checked out and judged. Thank You Village! You are my new home!

Barney's is my favorite department store, hands down in The Valley. They carry all the best men's designers that I can't find elsewhere and can easily drop a paycheck or two in one visit because their selection is incredible. If they don't have it in your size or in stock, ask for them to ship it to you from New York. Krista in men's is the best!!

Thank you LGO! Not only do I have Postino Central but now the Windsor and Churn in CenPho! Not much in variety for vegetarians/vegans but the food and drink are great. I really love how they have transformed the space/architecture and I understand that they are going to have a rotating menu... The fried okra is delish! More of a bar than a restaurant, expect a long wait on Friday nights for a table, but that's as to be expected anywhere. Love The Windsor. "Drinking wine at lunch is not a crime" and I completely agree ;) Become an e-posee member and you will get coupon specials emailed to you!

Ok, Biltmore what is going on with your dwindling dining and shopping options lately? Decided (mistakenly) to try this place but should have stuck to original plans of going to True Food. Anyways, the food and service really fell through here. No water was offered, no salt pepper, no flavor, nothing. Chipotle makes this place look authentic and 5 star worthy. The nachos had no toppings and the tacos, no flavor just veggies on a tortilla. After the food was thrown at us not even a chance to complain because we weren't even asked how it was. The server dropped the check and didn't even offer to box what we didn't eat because obviously he knew what we were eating didn't satisfy yet didn't try to correct the situation. I'll be spending my happy hours and lunches at True Food, Stingray or Hillstone while at the Biltmore from now on. Fail.
