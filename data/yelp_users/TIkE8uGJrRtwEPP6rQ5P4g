Was highly disappointed with my experience here. Went for pizza to beat the crowds before the bar closed  and ended up waiting a collective total of 45 minutes for two slices of CHEESE pizza anyway! After I ordered, they didn't have any cheese slices left so I had to wait which is fine I get that.  I go back to the counter 15 minutes later wondering what's going on when I see several guys one after another coming in and slipping this bigger guy (who was actually really nice) cash to just skip the line and get them pizzas. He even snagged a couple waters for them too from the fridge he was standing by. I noticed at least six people doing this while I was standing on the side waiting while everyone else was just waiting in line the FAIR WAY.  These guys were walking out with ENTIRE pizzas after two minutes after I and many others had been waiting for about a half hour at this point just because they were sliding money to this guy as tips under the table. I will not come back to this establishment I don't care if the "pizza is better than Joe's" which I highly doubt- because once I finally got my pizza it was COMPLETELY BURNED. At that point I was just so annoyed, ate about half and went to Taco Bell. THANK YOU Taco Bell for saving me from an unfair corrupt establishment. If it wasn't evident already; don't go here especially on a Friday or Saturday night after the bars unless you have an in with the big dude at the wait area to get ahead of everyone else.
