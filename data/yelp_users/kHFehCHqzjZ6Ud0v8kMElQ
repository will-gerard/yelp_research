I loved the bread and oil appetizer. I loved the service. When it comes to the food, I can say that my daughters loved the children's menu. Plus, the host was very good about making sure the high chair I received was clean for my daughter. They both got a very nice size drink: lemonade and chocolate milk. So parents of smaller children beware the drinks for kids are very big. The kids pizza and macaroni and cheese was very good according to my children, but the noodles they used in the macaroni and cheese were very big. I had to cut them in half so that my daughter could comfortably eat and that was a little off-putting.  I personally feel that if it is on the children's menu  that  but noodles should be small enough to fit into a child's mouth.  The noodles have ridges so if your child has a sensory issue they may not like it. The friends I was with  ordered two of the regular salads,  which were a very good size. They both said that their salads were delicious so I may have gone wrong with what I ordered. My own food, quite honestly, was not very appealing to me. I had the steak rusticana and it was very bland. The bread had a very nice flavor, but the steak and vegetables were very dry with very little horseradish sauce being used. It could have been what I ordered, but overall it just wasn't very good. I would rather go somewhere that has great service and good food. I would love to give this restaurant more than two stars, however the food for me just was not very good especially for the amount that was paid.

I must have a foggy college memory because this food simply is not as good as I thought it was when I went to Arizona State.  The fries were bland and tasteless, the shrimp was....I don't even know, and the fish is very much akin to what you would find between two buns and slathered in tartar sauce at a certain drive through with Golden Arches. And how do people think this is cheap?!  I ordered a kids meal, an adult meal, and an order of chicken tenders to the tune of $19.  That is not cheap! The only joy I found in the bland food is the sauce.  It's apparently a specialty that is only available there.  The sauce is delish, but the sauce really should not be the only source of flavor in a meal, and that is the biggest problem here,

My team and I picked this location for our last meeting of the school year. When we got there it was quiet and not very busy at all. The waitress was there right away to take our drink orders and make sure that we have plenty of chips and salsa. Once everyone got there we placed our order and we waited. And waited. And waited. It really stinks because as teachers we wanted to have a fun time for our last meeting however the wait was a little long. Additionally when they brought out the food it came out in trickle's. It was food for one to two people at a time. When it finally came time for my food to come out it had been more than twenty minutes since they first started serving the food and my order was wrong. At that time I was already late for another meeting that I had to get to so after waiting an additional 10 minutes for my order to be corrected I had to get up and go find someone in the kitchen to let them know my order needs to be cancelled. At that point she finally came out with the plate and said well your food is right here. I explained that I needed to leave about 5 minutes ago and as I'm not going straight home I cannot take the food with me. She stood there staring at me and asked again if I wanted to take it with me and I explained again I'm not going home so I can take it with me. I asked if I could have my check so that I could pay and they said that they would bring it right to me. They brought the wrong check and across the room I could still see the waitress shaking her head at me as if I had done something wrong. I truly am sorry that my previously scheduled meeting affected your kitchen the way it did however I came in with plenty of time to order food sit down and enjoy the company of my team and have plenty of time to move on to my next engagement. I apologize that your waitress was upset that I didn't take the street tacos with me however I would suggest that you get someone in your restaurant to light a fire under your workers but because it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to get a couple of street tacos.

I'm currently looking for a new salon and unfortunately this salon is a dud.  I love the fact that I get service as soon as I walked in, I was given water, and everyone was kind and welcoming.  However, I'm not paying for any of those things.   I walked in for a gel manicure and a pedicure and walked out very dissatisfied.  I asked for my nails to be short and I like the length but when he filed my nails he was filing the tip of my finger and not the nail.  When applying the polish it was very sloppy and uneven with polish going onto my cuticles.  He didn't make sure that my nails were smooth and free of stringies from the cotton so I now have that trapped in my gel polish.  I don't know if this was his first time with gel polish but it does not look good at all.

I come here for the pharmacy. With two young children I use the drive thru.  My time spent waiting has ranged from 7 minutes to 40 minutes.  Seriously? The manager needs to loo st the schedule or figure out who's not doing their job because customers should not have to wait that long for any reason.

I just wanted to send a huge thank you to Walgreens!  From age 18, (I'll be 34 this year) Walgreens has been taking care of my pharmaceutical needs.  From the anti-seizure medication they so lovingly dispensed to the 24/hr medical needs of my daughter on that ill-fated hospital visit.  However, I refuse to frequent your business any longer. After waiting over 25+ minutes in the drive through at your 83rd Ave and Lower Buckeye location in Tolleson, Arizona, I was told my request for a refill had not gone through on your side and it would be about 10 minutes for them to fill it quickly.  I had no problem waiting, your pharmacist did.  He argued that I couldn't hold the line up for 10 minutes (even though the two previous cars took 20+ to do their business).  I explained that I had food, my laptop, and kids in the car (for 25+ minutes in Arizona heat...yay!) and that was why I did the drive through.  Then he said I could pull around and get in line again...behind 3 cars (or 4).  I then said that since it took close to a half hour to get this far, I would wait.  I mean, really?  Who wants to possibly wait an hour for meds?  Oh, that right!  Me!  My longest wait time at this location was 47 minutes.  But since it's the closest to my home, I deal with the wait. Well, until the pharmacist dropped this bomb on me:  Ma'am, if you refuse to go to the end of the line or come in, I'll have to call the police. Really?  Are you serious? A technical glitch on your end prevents you from receiving my refill and you threaten me with the police?  I patiently wait almost every month for 30+ minutes to receive my medication and you threaten to call the police on me?  You have to be kidding.   Nope.  He wasn't kidding.  So instead of completing the order he claimed would take 10 minutes, the pharmacist argued with me for upwards of 5 minutes while the two pharmacy techs stood there staring at my incredulous face.  Thanks. No matter how many minutes of my life you wasted in the past, I was never rude, short, or mean.  I joked about the wait and dealt with it.  I sarcastically tweeted about it and then let it go.  No more, Walgreens.  This is too much.  To be told the police will be called because I wanted to wait like the two cars in front of me waited is just too much.

I went in for a mani pedi combo.  They were not busy and began right away.  They were not rushed and took the their time.  I really appreciated that the nail tech worked hard to get a design just right that I found on Pintrest.  To make it even better, the gel selections come with regular polish so our toes and hands can match.   Overall, for a first time visit, I was very satisfied.  The only reason I am not giving a five star rating is because I've of my dots came off the same day.

Okay....so I spoke too soon regarding my second visit.  I had my nails for two days before I chipped a nail and the gel polish started peeling off.  Not just chipping.  Straight up peeling! I call and speak to a lady and explain that there might be a problem with the curing process or the lamps because my nails should not be peeling after a couple days.  I asked point blank if they could be fixed.  She said to come in.  I was not able to go in for 4 days, but when I finally go in, no one knows me, remembers my call or the nail designs they've done in the past.  I mean, really? Not to seem full of myself but as a 5'10" black woman with gigantic man feet....nail techs usually remember me.  So they offer to redo my nails to the tune of $20.   So I pick a completely new design and ask (since I'm paying twenty bucks and all) to have my nails cut at short as possible.  The nail tech then says the my design would not be possible because I need a nail tip.  Okay. I have very long nail beds.  Even the shortest nails on me look long.  So I pick another design.  They design looked fine in the salon, but the next morning when I had time to look closer without my baby crying in the background, I see wrinkles in the polish and a chip. I'm officially done.  The first person who did my nails here was great.  She paid attention to detail, and worked her butt off to give me the design I wanted.  The guy from the second time clearly does not know how to work with gel or replicate designs.  The last lady I went to simply didn't not pay attention to detail.  So I am now in the market for a new nail salon.

Best Starbucks drive thru I've experienced.  Though I have had the occasional drink muck ups, for the most part they get my drinks right and they don't comment on my bedraggled appearance.  There's not much more a girl can ask for...especially when she looks like Chewbacca early in the morning.

I've brought my vehicle here numerous times.  Last Friday was the first time the wash left white steaks on my car.  I explained to the first attendant and he pointed out steaks I the door I hadn't noticed then went to get his manager.  I then explained to him that the Friday I came, I was in a rush and didn't notice the white steaks and even if I did, I didn't have time to come back as I was in a rush.  Like leaving for las Vegas two hours late rushing.   I thought it would be as simple as swinging back by as soon as I had time.  Nope.  I was told that rain makes for a rewash but only with in 24 hours.  And if you are not satisfied, you have to let them know at the time of your visit or you are s.o.l.   Oh, and after paying ANOTHER $5 (so now up to $15) my black car still has white steaks on it.  Thanks.

My search for a nail salon began in December of 2014.  I went all over looking for nails techs who do a good job but also are willing to fix their mistakes and honor appointment times.   I originally came in last minute to get rid of a horrible gel manicure before an important job interview. Tina took care of me herself and was very patient even when my youngest was a bit fussy.   The next time I came,  Tom did my nails and I was hooked.  I showed him a pintrest picture and he killed it. After that,  I could not wait to come back.  Since then,  I have been back and had awesome designs done by Tom and Andy (I think).  And that is just my nails! The techs do an awesome making my man like feet beautiful.  But out of everything, I love that if you don't like something about your nails,  Tina will do what she can to fix it.  This is the best nail salon I've been to in a good, long  while!

I started at this OB office at the beginning of my second pregnancy.  The first visit was super long but I figured that was because it was my first, plus it was really nice they had an ultrasound tech on staff.  My second visit was super short.  They brought me in due to spotting and performed an ultrasound to make sure everything was okay.  This is where the good stopped. My next appointment was with the ob.  I waited an hour and a half before being taken back to the room.  I was in the room for twenty minutes before I gave up.  I walked out and no one said anything or even called. I was content to let sleeping dogs lie, but then I found out it took two months for them to forward medical records to my new ob! I found out yesterday after being charged for duplicate tests by my insurance company!  I don't blame my new obgyn.  I completely blame this farce of medical office for testing on their laurels instead of doing their job.   So if you like shoddy record keeping and ridiculously long waits, by all means, THIS is the office for you.

I love getting my nails done and haven't had them done in well over two years.  So, I during some mommymetime I got my nails done before relaxing at a movie.  I said I want a pedicure and a gel manicure.  I was asked if I want them both done at the same time...I should have said no.  Very awkward position.  I don't recommend it. Both went okay, but I'm noticing little things.  The paint on my toes is already chipping.  My nails bubbled after leaving the salon. I now have two nails with bubbles which means I will eventually start picking at it.  And...at $56 there were no nail decorations at all.  You mean I would have to pay over $60 to have a flower?  Seriously?  No thanks.  Won't be back.  Update: It's now July 22 and six days since my gel manicure.  It's chipping!  I thought the first nail was an anomaly but no.  In addition to the bubbling that happened on  three nails (I found more bubbles on a different nail) my thumbs have visibly chipped.  I am beyond pissed.  I've looked at the nails of my friends and while I wasn't sure what to expect, I should still get longer wear than a regular manicure.  Ridiculous....

I went there once for a week's worth of food.  I was dropped by my previous meal delivery service because I was too far away. I walked in with high hopes.  Unfortunately,  the meals did not meet my expectations.  Food was bland and cut veggies looked like someone took a hack saw to them instead of a sharp knife.  The most frustrating party is the price. I paid an arm and a leg for gross food that honestly sat in my fridge and grew mold.
