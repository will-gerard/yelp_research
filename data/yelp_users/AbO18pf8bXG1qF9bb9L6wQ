I love the location of this hotel!  It is right downtown where all the action is.  It is a great place to host a conference.  They have nice large conference rooms, as well as smaller ones for break out sessions.  Mints and water are on the tables.  The best part of attending a conference is the snack shack!  They can easily host two large conferences simultaneously.    The hotel is also pet friendly.    The pool was under construction the last time I was there.  Apparently, you could use a nearby hotel's pool but I did not find that out until it was too late.  It would have been nice to know at check in.  The pool does have cabanas and it's near the gym.  There is a poolside bar too.  I love how the hotel staff's name tags have their names along with where they are from.  Michigan was representing.  Also, they let me extend my check out on many occasions pro bono.  Granted, I was with two dogs and a nursing baby.  The rooms are nice.  A big comfy bed, desk, wifi, flat screen, alarm clock radio with i-phone/pad/pod synching, nice sitting chairs.  Nice roomy bathrooms too.  After your day you can hit their restaurant or bar.  Or if you are feeling adventurous explore downtown, hop the light rail to Phoenix, climb "A" mountain.  During, a recent babywearing conference, the hotel even provided a conference room for breastfeeding and pumping.    But, they really knocked my socks off during my last visit.  The concierge helped us get to our room by walking our dogs for us.  We had our hands full with all our baby gear- we looked like we were opening a Buy Buy Baby with all that we packed.  Then she sent us a bottle of wine, mineral water, chocolate covered strawberries, a cheese plate, a chartecurie plate and  handwritten note thanking us for sharing our family with her.  That was five star all the way.

Dear Slices Pizza,  Thank you for offering a yelp check in discount!  Also, your baked potato bacon pizza is just as good as my beloved Georgios in East Lansing Michiagn.  Thank you for using russet not red skin potatos.  The only things you were missing was a sour cream topper.  Your Gyro pizza is also the bomb, very similar to my Georgios.  I was only in town for three days, but you are one of the reasons I will make the 2 hour trip to Tempe any day.  You are delicious....my only regret, is not eating more of you.  I really appreciate your thin crispness...Parting is such sweet sorrow.  Till we meet again,  Christy R.

Woot!  I have found Chicago level good Thai food in AZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am giving Yupha's Thai Kitchen the crown for AZ's BEST Thai food-hands down!  I was elated to see they had beef and pork Thai style jerky on their menu.  Folks, this is the real deal...it might sound weird but it is amazingly good....just as good as the street food I used to get at the Thai Buddhist Temple's Sunday Markets.  It brought tears of joy to my eyes.  I will drive the two hours to Tempe any day for this dish!  The inside of this place is unlike any other Thai restaurant is no small, dingy, typical hole in the wall kind of place.  It is hip, modern and elegant (in a relaxed, non intrusive way).  The plates are white and square...the placemats are bamboo like...they even plate the food!    The beef jerky was cooked perfectly!  The sauce was dazzling- it is like a Thai waterfall sauce with lovely notes of lime and chili.  The sticky rice was presented in a banana leaf....the papaya salad was great and you could tell, they made it with a mortar and pastel-the proper way.    I also tried the Thai Toast, which was a special of the day...it was not much to write home about.  Minced chicken inside of panko crusted fried bread.  The sweet chili peanut dipping sauce was quite good.  One diner stole the show, when his dish arrived wrapped in tin foil that was shaped like a swan...I am guessing it must have been the duck (they have duck served 4 different ways here)...yes, it is cheesy....but kinda cool at the same time.  I saw at least 4 tables ask their servers, what he was having.  I wish more places offered Thai style jerky!  Now if I could just get some mee krob on the menu, I would be in total nirvana.   No room left for desert, but they had some nice offerings for sure...I rarely can turn down a Thai style fried banana with the tasty sesame seeds in the batter.....yuuuuummm.

I was over the moon excited when I saw crispy pad Thai on the menu....crispy pad Thai is super hard to find outside of Chicago or Boston.   And I have been dreaming of this dish for about 8 years...so Thai Hut had some pretty big shoes to fill due to my lofty expectations.  Sadly, it did not live up to my expectations.  I asked for no egg and it did have egg.  There were barely any bean sprouts, and the few that were present were soggy and cooked, I prefer them fresh and crisp.  There were also no peanuts and I adore peanuts on any pad Thai.  These elements are what differentiates the dish from mee krob (also, dear to my heart).  The portion was  large and the noodles were nicely fried crisp.  However, the sauce didn't evenly coat the noodles and the flavor was not that great.  They also did not ask about my spice level.  Still I give them props that they even have this on their menu.  The Thai iced coffee was really nice, tasty and refreshing.  My water was also refilled frequently.  This place needs a makeover big time.  The ceiling needs replacing and has extensive water stains and damage.  They do have a separate room for parties.  I would prob. come back, but I would prob. try a massaman next time.  2.5 stars overall.....

This review is for the food available at the Phoenix Airport.  I had the Classico.  It was served on rosemary focaccia bread with olive oil, fresh basil, tomatoes, mozzerella and nice quality spicy proscuitto.  It was a very tasty sandwich.  Not soggy at all, which many pre wrapped sandwiches tend to do.  The Chicken Milano salad with corn, hearts of palm, bell peppers, shredded carrots, grilled chicken looked fresh and tasty.  I could not believe I was seeing airport food.  I highly recommend.  If I am in town I would for sure go to their main location.

I often have a self debate on which cuisine I would chose if I could only have one for the rest of my life.  It's an epic battle between Middle Eastern and Mexican, but a coaled fired pizza is a close contender.  So, when I was downtown I was stoked to see some Turkish cuisine.  I went for the chicken kabab, which is one of their specialties.  It was served with Basmati Rice sans my beloved vermicelli, hummus, salad and pita.  There were two skewers of tender, juicy, nicely marinated breast meat.  If it came with some toum, I would have been on cloud 9.  Another specialty is the doner, the Turkish version of a gyro, where they slice the meat off the spicket in front of you.    I'd come back for sure.

This small batch paleteria specializes in handmade Mexican ice pops.  They use local, fresh, seasonal ingredients and they even grind their own spices.  Their menu rotates and they ship nationwide.  They are good.    On the other hand, the Agua Vitas are great.  If you want to "treat yo self" like Ben, Tom and Donna on Parks and Rec grab a Agua Vita, which is their take on an Aqua Fresca drink.  I'm an adventurous type who like spice, cucumber and cilantro.  So when I saw the Pepinto Vita (fresh cucumber syrup mixed with fresh cilantro and chile powder blended with refreshing white tea) I felt as if it was custom made for me and me alone.  As she hand crafted and shook my libation, I imagined I was starring in my own episode of pimp my drink, instead of pimp my ride.  Oh, how I wish I could have kicked this up a notch with a little hooch.    Not a fan of herbaceous?  Fear not, as they have plenty of fruit varietals to wet your whistle.

I'm frequently in town for work and this place is within walking distance.  Of course, when I'm in a new town I plan out my culinary treats via Yelp.  I seriously could not imagine travel without it.  I had to say I when I set my eyes on nachos with feta and garlic sauce, I knew I had to experience it.  But what came out was cold and I left most of it on my plate.  I was hoping for a creative masterpiece and it was more like a paint by numbers done by a blind person.  I think the positive reviews must be by college kids who have not developed a refined palate or the jungle juice has dulled their senses.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting gourmet and I get down with dives...but seriously, at least flavor your chicken and heat your food.

Market on the Move (MOM) is a 3000 club project started by Ester Wavey.  Market on the Move works with the Borderlands Food Bank to rescue about 30 million pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables EVERY YEAR!  How do they do it??  They bring over $45,000,000 worth of produce to local churches once a month, usually the first Saturday or Sunday.  And get this.....you get 60 POUNDS of produce for a donation of ten dollars!  Honeydew, baby watermelon, cucumbers, squash, green beans, zucchini, two kinds of tomatoes all fresh for you in a farmer's market atmosphere....  Instead of the food going to waste, they bring it to the community.  Save the Food.  Feed the Hungry.  Neighbors Helping Neighbors.  Those are their mottoes.  Not only do they distribute fresh produce, they provide free health screens, diabetes and cancer prevention and educational classes.  They help feed more than 460,000 families in need.  And distribute fresh produce to more than 300 food banks.    I was heading home from the Color Vibe 5k when I saw the sign "60 lbs of produce, $10".....sharp turn right and we were at Saguaro Canyon Church on Old Spanish Trail, which holds their MOM market the first Saturday of the month November-May.  The market is in Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Goodyear, Glendale.  Check the 3000 club's calendar for specific dates.  I think there is one somewhere in AZ just about every Saturday....  It's a juicer's dream come true!  These churches host in Tucson :    *Emmanuel Baptist Church  *Friends In Deed  *Most Holy Trinity Church *Mount Zion Lutheran Church  *Northminister Presbyterian Church  *Pima Community College  *Saguaro Canyon Church  *Santa Catalina Catholic Church  *St. Ambrose Parish  *St. Cyril Parish  *St. Pius X Catholic Church  *Sunnyside High School  *Tucson Fellowship Bible Church  *Tucson Medical Hospital  *TUSD Pueblo Magnet High School  *Vision Church  Thank you 3000 Club and Ester!  FYI- this is a nonprofit charitable organization with a 501 (c)3 status....so help support this amazing, generous charitable group!!!!!!!

This was a great way to break up an airport layover.  I had the BLT which was served on thick toasted bread and had delicious thick cut peppered bacon.  To my delight it was served with homemade kettle chips and a pickle that was pure pregnancy heaven.  I asked for another pickle and to my surprise three more were served up on a plate pro bono.  Seriously this is no Vlasic, this is some a-grade zmyology.  The kiddie meal of an egg, two pieces of the same high quality bacon, and hand-cut thick fries were a steal.  I was tempted to order a hand squeezed honey lemonade or a hand squeezed oj but I stuck with water.  They even had a high chair.  The food here is prepared with quality ingredients.  For example they make their own corned beef versus cheap-o deli meat. This ain't yo average airport fare.

I adore local businesses and Strawberry Hedgehog is tops in my book.  Who doesn't love luxury handmade eco-friendly vegan bath and body products?  I first started my addiction at a Yelp Gets Schooled event at Whole Foods in Tucson.  Which I might add that I got hooked up with mega samples.  I met the owner Tracy Perkins  and she was so bubbly and refreshing.  Bonus, she is a geology instructor and I am a rock hound...so she is uber cool in my book.  If you are lucky, you will get to meet her...follow her fb for demo dates.  Tracy, a vegan, was tired of misleading packaging and took matters into her own hands and created this business and I thank her.  Her soap are like works of art.  If you have acne, you will love the tea tree rosemary face soap.  The lemongrass ginger looked so pretty, I wanted to eat it....it was so pretty I didn't want to use it, but It was worth it.  I love, love, love the bamboo detox barm charcoal and green tea add to the detoxification process.  How I dream of being a member of the soap club or even better become one of her soap gnomes!  That's right you can get soap delivered to your door!  3 bars for 12 months is just 72.60 and 1 bar for 3, 6, or 12 months is 30.  The bars of soap last about a months.  Just imagine the aroma of essential oils filling your bathroom, transforming your shower into a zen like spa....  Check her out in AZ Whole Food locations or online.

Furbabies was started by a trained chef name Angela...and get this....he husband John is the human treat taster!!  He does not have it bad, as I must admit, they do look and smell pretty tempting.  I am extremely picky and conscientious of what I feed my furbabies, so I LOVE that these are grain free, BHA free, meat by product free and dye free.  They use human grade ingredients and do not use preservatives, by products, salt, artificial ingredients or sugar.   My pups are picky in the treat department and they woof this down and wag their tails happily.  I learned about them at Whole Foods' Yelp Gets Schooled Event.  I love that you can buy in bulk.  If you want to treat yo pup, I suggest you do so!  Hit up a demo if you can, she hooked me up with a bag of treats (one of each kind) for each of my babies...way cool.

As soon as I saw a sugar skull on the sign, I knew I was destined for the place.  Just as you cannot judge a book by it's cover, you cannot judge a restaurant on it's signage.  Luckily for me, cool sign aside, I was loving everything I tried.  Even the presentation was impressive.  They serve the tacos on a large branded butcher block.    Do not miss the Yelp check in bonus!  Our table got free guac and elote dip.  Both were double dippablly good.  I would order both again in a heart beat.  I'm not even a guac person and was all over this dip.  The braised beef cheek taco was super tender and juicy.  The chicken tinga taco with its passion fruit salsa, jicama relish, lime crema and hint of chorizo was addictive.  For their al pastor, they braise a pork shoulder, and it's full of flavor from the pineapple salsa.  I could eat these tacos- every day.  All day.  El Hefe (The Boss) Supermacho Taqueria also has some pretty good margs.  I stuck with the happy hour house marg but the salty chihuahua with jalapeno and hermanos pistola with cucumber pique my interest.  The place was pretty rowdy and this was just during a week night dinner.  I gather at night this becomes a club.  Who would have ever thought that a club would serve some of the best tacos I ever had.   They passed around crazy mustaches and we got some hilarious selfies.   While, it was not the best place to dine with a baby, we were with a group and made it work.  However, the food was so good, I would tempt fate again and bring her in the future, if it meat I got my hands on these boss tacos!
