During the day this place is acceptable, just to be served by a great guy named Ralph. He is a very cool senior with such a big heart.  The reason for the one star is that the service is so bad. If you are in a hurry go to the drive thru, that is where they focus their attention and pretty much ignore the guests in the lobby. However, you will get your food fast, just accept the fact that your order might be wrong.  This McDonald's is very close to our house and we sometimes stop in late night to get ice cream from the drive through. The service at night is beyond bad. They always have a difficult time giving back the correct change, the orders are wrong.   The one thing that really stands out is the way they shove your food order at you in the drive through. We like the ice cream cones, you would think that if I am in the drive thru in my truck and I order ice cream, that you might want to take a little bit of care in making the cone. Like clock work, they start handing me ice cream cones ( shoving at me is more like it) the cones are dripping and the ice cream is falling off the cone. I really don't want melted ice cream spilled all over, I asked for a napkin, the girl replied "there is paper around the cone"   For some reason, I keep thinking the service will be better at night, it never is.  If you want some late night entertainment, go though the drive thru at night. You must bring your sense of humor,Don't say, I didn't warn you.

I can now see why they have all 5 Star reviews. I needed to have a knot in my daughters necklace removed. I walked in and was greeted by a very nice welcoming Jennifer. I have been in many Jewelry stores and I have never felt so welcome. Jennifer is very friendly, she got the knot out and did not charge me a dime. As she was working on the knot, I looked around at the really beautiful pieces they had in the cases, very impressive.  Usually when you walk into a Jewelry store, you always feel this sense of pressure from the person helping you. I did not feel that at all. I will tell others about this store and I will be back to take a closer look at their offerings.  If that is the type of service that you receive when you need a knot removed, I can only imagine how great the service would be if I was making a purchase.   They are a great find.

We just heard about Ted's from a friend, I'm really glad that we did. When we walked in, there was a pretty long line, which to me meant that we were in for a treat. I had the Bratwurst Dog, my wife had the all beef. We are both used to Chicago Style Dogs, these are very different. The way they are cooked on the grill, the way they are poked at by the cook, I really enjoyed it.   Try the onion rings, we liked those as well.   It has a very unique vibe, we will be back.

I've been here before and the food was ok. Today the whole experience was worthy of a one star review. I called this morning to inquire about bringing my 16 year old daughter there today to celebrate Saint Patrick's day. I spoke to a manager and was told that we were more than welcome to stop in anytime before 9pm. After 9, everyone needs to be 21, I said we were coming down for the food.  We got there about 3:30 in the afternoon, we started to walk through the door and the employee at the door says its $5.00 cover for each of us. I said, we came to eat, his response, I don't care. The cover is $5.00.   I mentioned that I had called earlier and asked about bringing my 16 year old daughter down, and was him there was no problem.  Someone came out, claiming to be a manager and let us in to eat. Of course, I still had to pay $10 for the pleasure of walking through the door.   The food was really bad, it was just thrown together. I get it, it's a drinking holiday, it was busy, the food came quick, but it was a mess. And, served on a paper plate, with a plastic knife and fork.  Lesson learned, never returning on Saint Patrick's day.   I just called and talked to a manager named Brandon, his professionalism and apology has inspired me to add an additional star. I was offered to come in again and he would take care of my meal, I declined.  The guy at the door, could do well with some serious customer service training. He was not very welcoming at all.

Needed a great sushi fix. Asked around, everyone said "Moira". I'm so glad they did, Wow!   Great service from our amazing server Megan, we sat at the Sushi bar and watched the sushi masters at work. Thank you Michael, Able and Aaron. The Sushi was great! I'm coming back soon...and I live in Gilbert. Great vibe, well deserved 5 Stars.

There are good locksmiths and there are "Hacks" Mr. Lockout LLC is one of the good ones. They are professional, experienced and are there to provide a service and not rip you off.   The price that was quoted was the price on the invoice.   Carol runs a solid business, she does what she says she is going to do and I hope that I never need them again, however I know that if I have an issue with a lock, I am calling her.  Sadly, there are other lockout services that I believe are scammers. I called a few before I reached Carol. They were aggressive on the phone, the price they were quoting me was more than double of what I was charged and they even made it clear, that it is possible that the price could get even higher if they were not able to open the lock quickly. And they kept calling again and again even after I told them that I was all set.   I was charged a reasonable service call fee, plus a fair amount for the the different things that I needed done.  If you go somewhere else, Buyer beware.

Save your money, avoid this place. I would never go there again. If I could give it negative stars, I would.  My 11 year old daughter bought a Groupon for me as special treat for her Dad. I called first to make an appointment, the women who answered the phone was very short with me. I wanted to get an idea how long the appointment,  she told me that a Manicure and Pedicure would take about an hour, I did not mention that I had a Groupon on the phone.  When I got there for my appointment, there was only one other customer in the place. I thought to myself this is going to be great, I was there to just chill and relax.  Yeah, that did not happen. I have never seen someone clip my toenails as fast as this women. It was not relaxing at all! On top of that, before she began, she pulled out her upsell sheet.   She actually acted like she was offended that I just wanted the basic. After my less than 10 minute pedicure, I was the only one in the place, so I thought maybe the manicure was going to be relaxing. I was wrong there too.  The women who was giving me my very fast manicure, stopped in the middle and actually answered her cell phone.  I was in and out in 22 minutes. Cindy the owner was there and made the most amazing comment to me. "You can go ahead and leave her  tip on the counter"  the women who gave me my speed treatments was back on the phone.  It is not spotless, it is a very low quality and they really do not treat you very nice when you present a Groupon.  Buyer Beware  Please drive there first and see for yourself before you ever decide to go there.  You deserve Better!

We have received nothing but great experiences at the Apple Store in San Tan Village. We are always greeted with a smile and we get our questions answered. The One on One trainings are very helpful. I have to say this is a very busy store, however there are a lot of employees, so everyone gets helped. I see other reviews saying the employees are not friendly, I have never experienced that. What I have seen many times at the Genius Bar is the Apple Employees doing everything in their power to help the person in need, even when the customer was being rude and making a scene, they were still willing to help.  If you are a business owner, you owe  it to yourself to go in and meet the Business Specialist team. They are a great resource for you.   I have been helped so many times  by the Business Specialist Team. Delrhea always makes sure that I am taken care of, I have referred many people to her and I know that they are always  in great hands.   Casey and Jed are awesome as well.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!

The massage was GREAT! Kristen was awesome. If that is the case, why did I only give them 1 star. The main reason is the the way that I was treated from the different ladies at the front desk,it was not welcoming or friendly at all. I emailed in my intake form, so that I did not have take any time while there to fill it out. When I got there, the person at the front desk told me that I did not email that in, and was quite rude about insisting that I did not. Once they finally found it, I was handed another form to fill out. The first person had stepped away and someone else was at the front desk.  I walked up and asked about the add ons they offer, Foot Scrub etc. She did not want to be bothered.  I was hoping to love this place . The only reason I even stayed was I had a sore neck and shoulder. The experience at the front desk, really took away from the great massage that I received from Kristen.

Every time I am in need of an odd battery for one of the many electronics we have collected over the years. I am off to Batteries Plus. It is a pretty small store, yet they seem to have that obscure battery I need.  They are very friendly and they always seem to have the exact battery I need.

I have to say the store is impressive on the outside, the service on the inside, not impressive. I have driven by Dicks many times, however I'm pretty loyal to Sports Authority, they are always eager to help you get what you need.  I needed to get some 3 pound dumb bells for my daughter, and Sports Authority was sold out. I called Dicks in the afternoon asking for the 3lb dumbbells, I was told that they had plenty, almost a full rack. I had some dinner then off to Dick's.   I went to the dumbbell rack, I saw just what I needed, then looking closer I could see that the Neoprene was cracking and peeling on all of the 3lb weights,   The fact that many of the weights were in such bad condition was really surprising to see. I tried to find someone to help me, not much luck. I finally found the manager and asked for his help, I showed him the condition of the weights and he told me that they were not that bad. If I am going to buy something that is sold as new, I want it to be in new condition.  That seems fair.

I have lived in Gilbert for almost 10 years and I am so bummed that I only recently discovered Asia. This has become my new favorite place to eat, actually I have never had a favorite place. There have been places that I liked a lot, but never a favorite.   I love the vibe, the owner John and all of the staff make you feel very welcome. The sushi is super fresh and delicious. I am working my way through the entire menu.   It is really cool to have discovered palace that I can bring family and friends and business associates. If you do decide to visit Asia, don't be surprised if you see me. According to my credit card statement, I am there a lot.

I am so fortunate to have found Power MMA. I am 50 years old and on Aug 1 of 2014, I joined. It has been an amazing ride. I started with Muay Tai and it has really been amazing the The Brandts are some of the best trainers I have ever been around. I had no skills and they welcomed me with open arms and were patient and let me go at my own pace. When I started, I could not even finish the class, I was way out of shape. They encouraged me to come back, I did and with their expertise, I learned more and I got stronger to the point, I was doing Muay Tai every night, I then started boxing before the Muay Tai class.   Everyone is really friendly and always willing to help someone new. My 16 year old daughter does it too. It is a great way to spend time with your daughter.  It is really inspiring to be training with champion MMA fighters and boxers and also interacting with some of the top UFC fighters. It really feels like family.   By the way in Aug I was about 240 lbs, today I am 198. I will say that I am in the best shape of my life. I could not have done it with being around my power MMA family.   The focus is on getting healthy, you will not find many people taking selfies on the equipment, what you will find is kids and adults that want to get healthy and are working hard to get or stay fit.  I am proud to have my Power MMA sticker on my car and I wear my Power MMA shirt with pride.

I wish that I would have found Clearly Clean 9 years ago. I have not had the best luck with other carpet cleaners. I will never consider going anywhere else. Dale's work ethic is impressive. I have seen my carpet cleaned by many other carpet cleaners, watching the way my carpets were cleaned by Dale was so different. He took his time and did not rush, and the results speak for themselves.   Our carpets look amazing!

There is this word called courtesy and courtesy can really go a long way. I borrowed a friends car this morning and as a thank you for the favor, I decided to get their car washed. I saw a Full Circle wash and pulled in, I checked the Yelp reviews. They only have 2 1/2 stars, I know that people are picky about their cars so I gave them the benefit of the doubt.   Big mistake, there was a chip in the window that was brought to my attention, the guy told me that they can fix it while I wait and at no charge, I just need to give him my insurance info. I told him no thank you, he just kept at me, not taking no for an answer.   Now, I'm paying full price for a wash with some extras, I do not want to be hounded about the glass. I finally told him that the car was not mine, he starts acting like he does not believe me.  The pressure to get the glass repaired was offensive, the result of the car wash was poor, it was a very low quality job.   This place needs to be shopped by corporate, there is some serious management issues.  If I could give it ZERO stars I would.  Hire some neighborhood kids to wash your car, going to this place was not a good experience. Trust me, believe the bad reviews.

Val Vista Lakes is an amazing place to live. The clubhouse facilities are really something to see. A jr Olympic swimming pool, a sand entrance lagoon pool with water falls with a lake as a background. All in the middle of Gilbert Arizona.  A great place to spend time with family and friends.

Cafe Zupas has become a family favorite. The food is fresh, the staff is friendly, it is also a nice value with the $7.99 combos. Their soups are made fresh on the premises and lobster bisque has become my favorite.  One of the cool things that my daughter really likes is the italian syrups that you can add to the drinks.   They also keep the place spotless and they bus your table.  I think the chocolate covered strawberry that comes with everyones meal is a nice touch.  They can get busy, but the staff is very friendly and they make your order fast.  Two thumbs up from me...or in the Yelp world 5 Stars.

First off, if you start looking for the Super Star Car Wash, you may be a bit confused, there are no signs that say that. What you will see is the $3 car wash. Now that we have that taken care of, this place opened up and I just kept driving by and never stopped in because I will admit it, I was a self service car wash snob. I have to say, I am now a fan of this carwash. I have been going to Danny's and Full Circle for years.  I really thought that a full service place was the way to go, that is until  I found this place.I drive a Hummer H3 and I always like it to be clean.   So here is how this place works, you can buy a wash as a per wash fee, or you can pay for the unlimited wash plan. That is what I do, they have a $16 a month plan, which covers you for a basic wash. I really don't think that type of wash does too good of a job, that was the first plan I bought. I was going to cancel, then I learned about the $26 a month plan. This one does a much better job and to my surprise you even get your wheels dressed right inside the automatic car wash. If you get the automatic tire dressing, make sure you wipe the tires before you drive. Otherwise it will splash all over, I learned that the hard way.  They also have very powerful free vacuums available.  What I like best is it is fast, there can be a summer storm in the early afternoon or even a Haboob and in about 5 minutes, my hummer looks like it just got detailed.

It is time for me to change my review. WOW! Has this place gone down hill fast. I used to pay for the monthly service and I have recently cancelled it. The staff is not friendly, they rush you through the line. It appears that they have increased the speed that you now go throughout the tunnel, it just does not do a very good job. They are supposed to give your car a spray before going into the tunnel, they give it a light mist.  What really made me mad at this place was the fact that a bad driver panicked inside the tunnel and backed into my truck, which caused the car behind to hit me. I tried to discuss this with them and they just really did not want to be bothered. It is not that there is a problem, it is how they respond to the problem. They don't respond.  There are better places than this, if you want an ok wash at a cheap price, then this might be the place, is this place a good value???? NO!  I really used to like this place, read my previous review. Not anymore.

I was in need of a shower chair for a family member on a Saturday. If you are ever in need of medical supplies on a Saturday you will find that the majority of medical supply companies are closed on Saturdays. I felt so lucky to find Ahwatukee Medical Supply,they are open on Saturdays.  It is a small store in a strip mall, it was a little busy, so I waited my turn.  I walked around the store and was amazed at all the health related items that I had no idea even existed. The one thing I really appreciated was the way that they treated the customers. The average age of the customers in the store were in there 70's and 80's, and they were asking a lot of questions, the staff were were very clear in their answers and were also very patient. They really come across as really trying to help.  When it was my turn, I asked for what I needed and was shown a few options, I was leaning towards a different chair than what the salesman was suggesting, he clearly explained why I should get the chair he suggested. The reason was that it was a safer chair for my family member to use, and even showed me why, actually using the chair himself to make his point.  I really appreciated that.

Guitar Center comes to the east valley! I have to say I have been so excited to know that a Guitar Center was going to be so close to my house. I have been going to the Tempe location for years. I am hoping that soon I can add a few more stars in a future update. Today was a BIG disappointment. I think the new employees need way more training.  Pros: A Brand New Guitar Center in the East Valley. A large selection of amazing guitars, drum kits and a variety of other instruments.   Needs Improvement: I interacted with over 7 employees and I have no idea who they were, they never introduced themselves or even welcomed me to the new store. The Tempe store was a great place to go, there is just a cool welcoming vibe. I sure hope that this location grows into that type of place. The employees are new and they are just learning, they were not very up on what grand opening specials they had and then when I asked about a special on some software, ( Like what exactly does the software do) multiple employees had no clue.  This is just a young store and I hope that it will get better over time, right now, if you are someone who has been to the tempe store, the new mesa store is a bit different.  As someone in Pro Audio, I was really excited to see how they were going to showcase the PRO equipment. I don't think that the corporate office really thought this through. There is no room for monitoring speakers, the pro audio section seems like an after thought by corporate. I can't believe that they do not have a separate room for DAW demos like in Tempe. They have one for the drum cymbals, nothing for the PRO equipment. I think they really missed the mark.  I was really hoping that this would become a place where they would have Avid Demo nights  and special clinics. It does not look like that is going to be the case.  Like I said before, I will be back and I hope that can add a few stars, today 2 is all that I can give.

Hats off to the great staff at El Hefe!  There was a miscommunication on when myself and 100 more of my friends were supposed to show up. We showed up an hour early, they were a bit overwhelmed as they should be. However, they all kicked it up a notch, big time. The staff was friendly and the managers were making sure that everyone was taken care of.   The Mahi Mahi Tacos were outstanding, I will be back.

We tend to go to the same places all the time. I was in the mood for something new. I found a great new place. From the moment I was greeted to when we left, it was a 5 star experience.  The staff was super friendly, they made suggestions on what to order, the food was delicious, we will be back.   Was here last night, now I'm back again for delicious sushi. This is a really nice place.
