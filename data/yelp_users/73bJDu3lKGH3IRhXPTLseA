A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!  I can't say enough good things about this place!  I first discovered this lil gem barhopping with a friend of mine and was completely in awe of the whole ambiance of the place.  The entrance is a narrow stone stairway that leads down to a small bar area with a couple of booths and seats in front of a fireplace.  Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!  The prime ribs were huge!  We had a great time.  It's a quiet lil hole in the wall bar/restaurant.  Great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night!  I can't wait to go again!

Exactly what you'd expect from a dive bar.  They have a couple of pool tables, tv if you're into sports, karaoke, and a touchtones for music!  On another note the ladies bathroom has shower curtains as doors : Â·\

I worked mostly with Becky in the party rentals dept for my wedding and she was great!  I rented table linens, chair covers & sashes, and pipe and drape.  She was very easy to keep in touch with and helped answer many of my questions.  I had originally planned on renting 4 outdoor heater for our ceremony which was in January, but called the day before to cancel them once I realized that the weather would be perfect and we wouldn't need them.  This saved me $200!  Becky had gone home sick that day so I spoke with Sheila and she was also very friendly and helpful.  The delivery guys brought everything to the venue 1st thing in the morning and since no one was really around to tell them where to set up the pipe and drape one of them gave me a call to inquire.  I don't recall his name but he was kind on the phone and understood my instructions.  In the end we were missing a table linen (not sure how) but Becky told me not to worry!  The pipe and drape provided wasn't as high as I was originally told but it turned out fine.  I would definitely recommend them to anyone!

We came for dinner and got a booth right away. I was surprised there wasn't a wait. Our waitress was friendly, she could've improved on her attentiveness. My husband had to go looking for her for some condiments, and I would've liked a refill on my drink. All of our meals were great, no complaints there! I don't come here often but when I do I make sure to order a salad so I can have their mustard vinagrette! Their loaded baked potato soup is excellent too!

As most people know there are a lot of ups and downs to planning a wedding.  The event coordinator at ACC made most of this very easy for me.  I was worried things wouldn't come out the way I wanted but Amy, Carrie, Jose, and the rest of the staff made it all come together perfectly!  The food was AMAZING!  I've gotten so many compliments on Jose, my banquet manager, and the rest of the service staff.  My only complaint would be the price, but since the rule is you get what you pay for I can't really complain!  My day was perfect, I wouldn't have changed one thing, and I can't thank them enough for all their hard work!

We enjoyed an awesome Valentines dinner here!  Had reservations for 8pm, showed up about a half hour early and were taken right to a booth as requested.  Amina was our server for the evening, and she was great!  Very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  I ordered the Perfect Patron Margarita, it was average for my liking but I certainly didn't let it go to waste.  For the appetizer we tried the Jalapeno Pretzel Sticks with the jalapeno spinach cheese dip.  The pretzel sticks were huge!  The cheese dip was like a spinach queso blanco.  Anima highly recommended the Brew House Chicken, grilled chicken served over white cheddar mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.  The grilled chicken and potatoes had a brown mushroom gravy on it...YUM!  Veggies were also cooked perfectly!  Hubby had the 11oz sirloin medium rare, and that's how he got it, with mashed potatoes and lemon rice.  Overall great service & great food, two thumbs up!

This review is for Nadia in the fragrance department...I went in looking for a new perfume for my wedding day.  She new every fragrance and had the perfect description and occasion for each of them!  I told her my likes and she was able to help me narrow it down to my favorite.  Very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly!

I always feel like the food is pretty average for their prices, but they are pretty good portions. Service for todays lunch was quick, we were told a 20 minute wait to be seated but it was more like 5. Our waitress was very attentive, no complaints there. We ordered the artichoke spinach dip for an appetizer, the dip itself was OK, the tortilla chips were a little stale for my taste. My daughter ordered the fish tacos tempura battered, she asked for hard tacos but got soft corn. I had the chicken piccata lunch portion, chicken was tender and still plenty of food for the lunch menu. We were stuffed but still ordered a slice of salted caramel cheesecake to go. I'm sure that's delicious, when is cheesecake not awesome? Almost $80 for lunch is a good reminder why I hardly ever come here though.

I was referred to this bakery for my wedding cake by a friend who gets all her bakery needs here.  I have to admit I was a lil put off by the looks of the shop since it's not in a brand new building and all fancy and decorated with wedding cakes, etc.  We did a tasting and I remember thinking the cake itself seemed a lil dry, but I went ahead and decided to go with them.  They didn't ask for a deposit or any money for that matter until about a week before the actual wedding day.  This gave me plenty of time to look around for other options.  I went to one other tasting in a bakery that caters specifically to wedding cakes....my mistake!  I decided to go ahead and stop stressing and trust that Baker Wee could handle the job.  My cake was to have 3 layers all with an intricate lace looking design, I even provided a picture.  Compared to the quote given to me by the other bakery they were a steal!  I was able to add the 3rd layer and still be under the other quote!  I was mainly worried they wouldn't be able to pull it off artistically.  Boy was I wrong!  It looked exactly how I wanted and tasted great!  The cake was moist & the butter cream icing was to die for!  All the employees were very friendly and helpful and when I went days prior to the wedding to pay in full for the cake they gave my daughters two very large cookies on the house!  I appreciate all their hard work and creativity ( the other baker wanted to use fake edible lace!? WTH? )  I will most definitely be back in the future to see what kind of cakes and other yummy edibles they can create for me!

Everything was great until I saw our waitress sweep up a mess on the floor from another table then swept the seat of the chair.  Oh and she was having a conversation with her manager at the same time, and he didn't say a thing about it! Gross! Is that how they clean off the tables too!?

Came here on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch.  Not busy at all.  Food and service was excellent!  We ordered the bruschetta for our appetizer, one of the best in my book!  For main course, we split the Italian beef sandwich with au jus and a small 7" pizza with pepperoni with banana peppers and onions.  The sandwich do die for!  We added provolone cheese but in all honesty I could've eaten it plain.  The beef was perfectly cooked and sliced super thin the way it should be!  The pizza was cooked perfectly as well, it tasted like homemade pizza with the freshest ingredients.  I can't say anything bad about this place except there's not a location close to my house.  Even the napkins were great!

D-licious!!! We have been wanting to come here for a while, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much bigger it looks on the inside than just driving by. We were able to get a reservation on a Friday night within about an hour, and once we arrived were pleasantly greeted and seated within minutes. Our server was Steve who was also very pleasant, friendly, and informative. Although I couldn't partake in any spirits it appears they have many to choose from, and looks like an extensive wine list that I can't wait to try next time! Side note, they do not have beer on draft. Only by the bottle. They brought and assortment of bread, all very good. My husband ordered the Rhode Island calamari for an appetizer. I personally don't eat seafood, but he is from Boston and said it was the best he's ever had so I'll take his word for it. For our main course I ordered the 8oz filet medium well and classic mac 'n cheese, my husband ordered the 22oz prime rib and the Yukon gold mashed potatoes. It seemed to take a while for our meals to come, maybe due to it being a busy Friday evening. I started to get a little impatient. But once our food arrived I had no complaints. My filet was cooked to perfection, and tasted AMAZING! The mac 'n cheese was good, for me it had a little bit of a sweet taste. I tried the mashed potatoes and they were creamy and seasoned just right! I saw a previous review that bashed the atmosphere saying that it was not up to par with the prices. I didn't notice. All I can say about that is I'd rather have a spectacular meal for my money than a fancy chair or light. The restaurant itself was clean and well kept as were the servers and wait staff. For my next visit I would like to try being seated on their patio (weather permitting of course!) I drove by this place for years not realizing it's probably one of Peoria's best fine restaurants, and best kept secrets! I'll definitely be returning and spreading the word! No need to drive into the city or all the way to Scottdale for a prime piece of meat!

Not impressed with the new flat brad sandwiches...bring back the wraps!  I do however love the paradise pasta, salads, soups, chicken walnut croissant-which, and bakery!  The employees are always pleasant and quickly move you through the line.  Unfortunately my member key chain came off and now I can't redeem points towards meals, I have to start all over with a credit card type deal.  One more card to carry around :-\ Overall I have a good experience every time at every location.  Did I mention, BRING BACK THE WRAPS!?

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  I can't say enough great things about this company!  First let me point out that the first company I called to come to our office and give us a quote showed up 3 hours late, and we never ended up receiving the actual quote.  I found Just-In Time here on Yelp and based off everyone else's good reviews gave them a call.  We set up a time for Bobby to come out and walk through the office in order to provide an accurate quote and not only was he on time, he was early!  He was very professional, knowledgeable, and advised we use e-crates instead of boxes.  After he was done with the walk through he said he would provide his info to Gina and she would be in contact via email with the quote.  To our surprise she was in contact within a couple of hours!  Once we had an actual move date to schedule for I gave her a call and she was so helpful!  We ended up having 3 guys come out to pack up our office on a Monday, and the next day we had 6 guys and 2 trucks for our move.  Again, both days, they arrived early and ready to rock n roll!  I think it took them about 2 hours the 1st day to pack everything, and the next day (move day) it took about 3 hours to load the trucks.  Super fast, and not to mention this happened during some of the hottest days of the summer here in Phoenix with no complaints!  They were all very polite, professional, and careful with all our items.  They were very patient when trying to rearrange furniture to our liking, and even helped move some furniture previously at our new location from one floor to another.  It was also nice to see that the total came in under our quote!  I would absolutely use them again for any of my moves, business or personal!  When Bobby came to pick up our e-crates he let me know they work in 48 states!  Good to know in case anyone is looking for out of state movers!  Thanks Just-In Time for making our move a little less stressfull!  Sincerely, Pain Stop Clinics - Corporate Office

Been here a couple times now, both in the drive thru.  Quick and friendly service just like a drive thru should be.   This is not your Filiberto's, Eriberto's, or whatever chain and certainly not a Taco Bell!  No offense to those places but this is much better in my opinion!  I've had their tacos and just recently the chicken fajita combo...YUM!  Love the rice too!

Plenty of seats available so I'm guessing they were short staffed since it took 10 minutes to seat us and another 10 minutes before we had to ask if we had a server.  Appears that they have more working bussers  than they do waiters. After we finally ordered our food we waited another 45 minutes before we decided to let our server know we had to leave. She asked if we would like our food boxed up. I laughed and said well if it's ready just bring it out. She went back in to the kitchen then I noticed she walked around a different way like she was avoiding us to go ring up another check. I saw another server walk out of the kitchen with 2 plates and walked right past us that's when we left. The staff was practically oblivious to the fact we were even sitting there. They must be trained not to make eye contact. Never once did anyone acknowledge us 1st. Never once did anyone apologize for the slow service. An hour and half of my day wasted. I will never recommend this place, and will probably never be back!

I have seen Dr Harris for almost 12 yrs now and today was treated by the staff and herself with such disregard I'm appalled. It's been made clear to me they only care about making money and not the treatment of their patients. I am almost in my 3rd trimester with my 3rd child and they blindsided me today wanting me to make 3 consecutive payments of $751.66 due to my high deductible of $2500. I work in medical billing and insurance and am well aware of how it works and what I will need to pay. The office manager spoke to me like I was a complete idiot. They refused to make any attempt at working out another payment plan saying "It's their policy" to have complete payment 2mo prior to due date. If I wasn't willing to pay it the office manager Diane said they would have to discontinue my care! She practically mocked me asking if this was my first pregnancy and when I told her my 3rd she asked what my insurance was before like it even mattered. When I had my 1st & 2nd children with this practice 9 & 11 years ago things were VERY different! Today was just the tip of the iceberg for me. I was in tears and they were heartless. As if I don't have enough to worry about right now they didn't care that they were asking me to pay an insane amount of money before they even treated and submitted a claim. By no means do I have a problem paying up front for care, but to require and demand such a large amount in such a short amount of time was in my opinion unethical and inconsiderate.  They had previously mailed me an estimate of $290 monthly payments but when I tried to reach the person of contact, MULTIPLE TIMES, my call was never answered or returned. No follow up was made until I came in today and they hit me with $2255 due in 3 months. So according to them it's my fault. Yes I'm ultimately responsible for paying my share, and I made it very clear I intend to do so, but have some compassion and work with your patients financial needs.   I've noticed a lot of other things happening here as well. I'm consistently being called to change my appointment due to surgery scheduling, because of course I don't have a life and schedule of my own to keep. Most of the MA's come across as rude and are very short with you. For a woman, going to an exam is no picnic maybe they could make some attempt at making the visit a little more pleasant. My husband and I were in the waiting room once and an elderly woman who checked in was asked to leave a UA, she said to the receptionist she usually does it after her appt because it takes her a while. No big deal right? I don't know what that means exactly, but after the woman walked away the girl behind the counter turned to give the lady's chart to the MA and they rolled eyes at each other! Lastly, I was scheduled to come in for a procedure that they supposedly verified would go towards my deductible. In turn they asked for payment up front otherwise they would not do it. We're talking $140 here. When I got to my appt I asked that they bill my insurance 1st then bill me. Denied! So I pay it. Come to find out the claim was processed with a $40 copay. Do you think they attempted to refund my money or even let me know this? Nope! I only found out because I went onto my insurances website to print EOB's for my taxes and happened to see this date.

Been here quite a few times.  I'm not a seafood eater so I can't rate the sushi but the edamame, teriyaki chicken, and beef yakisoba are all awesome.  They have a good happy hour for saki bombers too!

Waste of time coming here for lunch!  Came in with three co-workers on our lunch break and service was horrific!  We immediately asked for extra bean dip.  Our waitress, Stephanie, took our drink order and said she'd be back to take our food orders even tho we were ready to order right then.  She proceeded to go behind the bar and make some drinks and ring some orders and check on other customers.  She finally came back with our drinks but no bean dip.  We waited and waited and waited for her to come take our orders and finally had to ask to get someone else to serve us.  This turned out to be the manager.  We had ordered four lunch specials and one to go.  After waiting some more she came back and said we could get the to go order only at full price so we declined.  We finally got more chips and salsa from our original waitress who brought two of everything even attitude.  By this time we had been waiting for at least 30 min since the manager had supposedly put our order in.  We got up and asked for the manager again since at this point we were running late for work.  She's nowhere to be found until we get up to leave.  She comes out with our food as we're half way out the door saying "they tried their best"!  No apology.  She offered to box it up but for what full price since the special is full price to go!? No thanks cuz they probably spit in it anyway!

Love the roast beef and cheese on sourdough!  This location is close to my work so I'm a frequent flyer.  I have always had great customer service here as well as their other locations.  Ya the prices are more than your Subway $5 foot long but you get what you pay for!

Absolutely by no means ever plan a party here!  I went in Dec '14 and spoke with a girl to get details about having my daughters birthday party here.  She told me that a $100 deposit would be required to hold the room and time/date and gave me their flyer also stating the same, this flyer along with the company's website clearly states under "The fine prindt" that "A $100 or $400 non-refundable deposit is required and is applied to the cost of the party".  I go in on 12/20/14 give my $100 deposit and schedule the party for 1/11/14.  On the day of the party there were 11 girls picking items ranging from $16-22. Every thing was great until I went to check out and the total came to $255.89.  I asked the employee ringing me up if that included the $100 deposit I had already paid as my understanding of what had been told to me, information given to me, as well as the website was that my deposit would be applied to the cost.  He said the deposit had been applied and that the total also reflected tax and gratuity.  I paid and went about my evening.  Still feeling that my total was incorrect I went over the final party receipt adding each item along with the tax and gratuity.  Everything added up to what I had paid, $255.89.  It looks to me as if the $100 deposit was NOT applied but added to the total cost of the party.  $355.89 for a kids party?!  That's insane!  The next day I contacted the store and spoke to the same employee who rang me up, he stated this was correct.  I pulled up the website again to confirm all the information that I was given before taking this further.  Under "Parties for Everyone" it does state "$100 plus the price of the pieces (Up to 14 guests)".......BUT then why would the fine print say the deposit is applied to the cost?  Maybe I'm misuderstanding the verbage of this companies policy or maybe they're using the wrong verbage.  Isn't a deposit just that?  Isn't a deposit supposed to go towards/be applied/be deducted from the final cost?  Otherwise wouldn't it be or shouldn't it be called a fee?  I contacted the corporate office and spoke to a Mary Kate who took my information asked me to email her a screen shot of my receipts and she would get back to me.  I did this immediately and never heard back from her.  I was finally able to reach a Shawn who's number was given to me by the store employee and he stated that it was ultimately rung up incorrectly but in my favor.  He stated the $100 deposit was not applied any tax which should have been $6 and some change.  Basically telling ME that I owe THEM money.  I explained as calmly that I could the way the party cost details were explained to me and that I felt very misled.  He obviously had no sympathy nor did he attempt to rectify any of it other than saying he would eat the cost of the uncharged $6 tax.  WELL HE CAN EAT MY SHORTS!  And that's being extremely nice!  I suggested he get together with his other corporate team members and revise all of their wording for parties as well as retrain all of their employees.  I hung up with Shawn and called Miss Mary Kate.  She answered and confirmed that she had received my email and I asked if she had a chance to look it over.  I asked if there was anyone I could speak to regarding this and she said "I think you already have" (with attitude, referring to Shawn).  She then, obviously trying to get rid of me, asked for my information to have someone else get back to me since I told her Shawn was not understanding me.  I told her she already had my information, she took it down the day before when I had spoken to her and I gave it again in my email to her.    This company gets 1 star from me...if I could give it less I would.  I will never be back.  I will never recommend this place for a party or any other get together.  They have the worst customer service, and the worst resolution skills.  It's obvious why they only have 1 valley location, and why their competitors As You Wish have successfully surpassed them.  If I didn't have a life and family to support I would stand outside the building to protest their poor quality of a business.  If it were my own piece of pottery I wouldn't even bother picking it up.  Actually I would pick it up, and then I'd mail it to Shawn and Miss Mary with a big F U!

No surprise here, still crappy service.  Today is the day the pieces are to be ready for pick up.  My best friend who has 2 young girls, 8 & 2, goes in to pick up their pieces and is told that the "party parent" will be picking up all the pieces.  Well that's news to me!  Shockingly no one shared this information with me when I scheduled the party or on the actual day when I and others asked when they would be ready.  I had my friend wait with her daughters while I called and spoke to the manager.  This is when it is explained to me that on the day of pick up all pieces will be ready after 1pm, and are to be picked up by party parent.  Reason being is they have limited space for pieces and a lot of the time other parents do not know or forget to get the item, then the party parent is called and either never calls back or comes to get the item.  Well that's all fine and dandy, but now I have all my daughters friends coming to pick up their pieces.  AND...if a parent is there to pick up the piece and you have limited space why not just give it to them???  Now I have a child who is upset because she was looking forward to picking up her piece today and you won't give it to her.  Nice!  Turns out even if I did know that pick up time wasn't until after 1pm and I showed up at 1:30pm some of the pieces aren't ready anyway and are still in the kiln cooling off.  My friend and her daughters live quite a distance and drove a long way to pick these up so by the grace of God I was able to convince the manager to give her the 1 piece that was ready.  Apparently the pick up time is displayed somewhere on their wall, which no one at my daughters party including myself saw, but you would think when we asked this would be explained to avoid confusion.  I certainly don't recall this being on their information flier and it's definitely not on the website either!....Listed under FAQ...  "How long do I have to wait to get my stuff? Pieces are available four days later.  For party and To Go items, please ask for specific pick up dates. Around holiday times the wait could be a little longer."  Sooo, just as I was calming down from the cost fiasco, now this!  Absolutely ridiculous.

My fiance and I were out running errands around town this past weekend and passed by this place.  I mentioned wanting to try it sometime and that I had been to a place with the same concept many years ago in Tempe and thought it was really cool.  After we were done running errands we were headed back the same direction and came up to Ghenghis and he pulled in the parking lot and suggested we go ahead and try it.  We walk in and wait to be seated like the sign says, right off the bat I notice several employees walk by without even acknowledging us.  Then this male employee walks over with a bewildered look on his face, like he clearly is not used to seating people.  I thought he'd figure it out since it's not exactly a large restaurant.  We should have just grabbed a seat at their bar!  He told us someone would be right with us and a girl came over and sat us...right next to the server station.  Whatever I was starving and didn't really care at that time.  Neither one of us had been there so our waitress who sat us rapidly explained the process, she went thru it so fast I just decided we should fill out their form and have them make our bowls for us.  When she got back to us for our order we ordered drinks, I got a coke and he ordered a beer.  We proceeded to sit there for about 20 minutes, meanwhile at the table next to us some people sat down after us and were brought their meals and were almost done!  Our waitress comes over and says our food should be out any minute, not long after that another woman comes over ( I assume the manager since she wasn't wearing a server uniform) and says that they are out of two of the seafood items that my fiance had ordered.  He changed his order and we continued to wait all the while thinking why the hell didn't they tell us that in the first place!  Then as we waited and waited some more I started wondering why our waitress said our food should be out soon when they clearly hadn't even started cooking it yet if they didn't even possess the food to cook it.  By this point I was extremely hungry and irritated, I had half a coke left his beer was empty and the waitress comes by and drops off a fresh coke that I felt like she did only to try and make up for our wait.  But maybe she should have thought of asking if my fiance wanted another beer since his was empty!  She did stop to ask if they had told us they were out of his order and said she would take our bowls off, whatever that meant.  We continued to wait a few more minutes until I just couldn't wait any longer.  We got up to leave and walked passed the manager lady sitting at a bar table who said thanks for coming...ya thanks for NOTHING!  They weren't even what I would call busy.  I have never had to walk out on service like that.  I was looking forward to a cool new experience and ended up being extremely disappointed.  I will never go there again!

We had my daughter's birthday party here and everyone had a great time!  Izzy was our server and she was excellent!  Give that girl a raise!  I scheduled for 2 hours of bowling, that included 2 lanes, unlimited sodas, 2 pizzas, and a GIANT cookie.  Izzy helped all the kids get their shoes and balls, she got all of our drinks and food, even helped serve it.  The atmosphere is awesome, definitely the best bowling alley I've been to!  I'll definitely be back, especially for an adult night!  I hear they have a live dj and live band, karaoke, laser tag, pool tables, arcade, and did I mention a full bar!?

Wow, this place was AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for a while.  I've heard parking isn't great but we came for late lunch so it wasn't bad at all.  I could see it being hard to find when the place is busy tho.  Sorry I didn't take any pictures this visit, I was too busy stuffing my face with all the delicious food!  We had the pretzel bites and fondue for appetizer by recommendation of our server.  My husband devoured the fish and chips,  I sank my chops into their prime rib dip and homemade chips.  I was hesitant to try it at first but so happy I did, it's one of the best french dips I've ever had!  I hate when the meat isn't cut and cooked right,  but it was done to perfection.  We'll definitely be back!

Received Valentines flowers from my husband... Sweethearts bouquet ordered thru FTD...hubby paid for the "Better" selection at $54.99 + tax & delivery & I got the worst!  This bouquet is supposed to have 10 roses and have burgundy mini carnations not pink.  I can handle the pink carnations it came with, but 3 roses really!?  Their "Good" selection says it comes with 7 stems of roses.  Even if there was a shortage of roses due to the holiday they should have called him to see if he wanted to replace them with something else.   Apparently they can't deliver a new bouquet today so they took $20 off...what the hell?  That's still a rip off!  These should be completely free!  Good job at ruining a sweet gesture, thieves.

Came here for early dinner during happy hour with the family.  Great happy hour specials!  Our server R.J. was awesome! Highly recommend his section.  All of our meals tasted great and came exactly as ordered.  We will be back!

Great service every time I come here!  Not a lot on the menu but that makes it easy to decide.  The chicken, special sauce, and Texas toast are amazing!  Not the greatest fries but everything else makes up for it.  Hoping one day they put one in North West Peoria!

Todd our server was very attentive.   We had a couple of glasses of wine on happy hour, and ordered some bruschetta which was delicious and a personal Margarita pizza also delicious!  I would love to see this place when it's busy,  it has a nice atmosphere.  I would definitely come here again.

Sat at the bar on a Thursday evening after work during happy hour and it wasn't busy at all.  Maybe due to it's location or the fact that it's still really new in the shopping center.  It's very nicely decorated and spacious once you walk in, sort of unexpected because of the shopping center itself.  Service was prompt and friendly!  I ordered a glass of Jellybean red wine blend to go with my Balsamic Chicken with sauteed spinach.  I had a hard time choosing between the Balsamic and Joe's special, which looked to be very similar on the menu.  The Balsamic was great, seasoned a lil strong, but still really good.  It came with two chicken breasts, a lot for me, so I took the second to go.  I'll definitely come here again to try Joe's special among other things like the bruschetta and pizza!

I tried this place after seeing another persons good review.  I drive past it almost every morning on my way to work, and it's right off the freeway with a drive thru!  I'm usually in a rush to get to work in the mornings so I love that I don't have to get out of my car.  I ordered a large iced caramel macchiato, which was delish, and a croissant with cream cheese.  The croissant was good, but I'll probably try a bagel next time or a donut since that's basically their specialty.  The girls that worked the drive through were super friendly.  The prices were fair, only thing that kinda stinks is if you're paying with a card your order has to be over $5.  Maybe that will change eventually as business picks up.  I personally never really have cash on me, but I'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.

I had such a great experience here compared to where I went to find out my baby's gender.  They were very friendly and informative over the phone when I initially called to schedule my appt.  I received several email reminders prior to my appt.  The facitlity was conveniently located, very clean, and welcoming!  My baby was being a lil stubborn snuggling up against my placenta but they were patient with her so they could try to get the best possible pictures of her.  They were very friendly and I liked that they pointed out what exactly we were looking at since we are not daily sonographers!  Complete opposite of our prior experience at Baby's First Ultrasound - 5125 N 16th St, Phoenix, AZ 85016.  I highly recommend scheduling your gender determination and/or 3D ultrasound with Sweet Pea in 3D!  You won't be disappointed!

Delicious! Breakfast for lunch? I'm in! Walked over from our office about 12:30 and had the option to be seated inside or out, no wait at all. We opted for indoor. While we waited for our waitress another had come to take our drink order, kudos for that! I love that a breakfast restaurant offers a full bar. I ordered Juan's Breakfast Tacos and added chorizo as a meat topping, slight extra cost but nothing to turn me away. Food came out in no time at all and it was awesome! 3 yummy breakfast tacos, because who doesn't love breakfast and tacos!? And let me just add that the prices are reasonable for Scottdale. I will definitely be returning to stuff my face with other things on the menu!
