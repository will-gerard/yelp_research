Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Mexican food......and its really hard (in my opinion) to f*$k it up!  My girlfriend and I decided to try this local establishment this past weekend....couldn't have been much more disappointed!  It was busy....some local convention going down in the area...anyhow, we were sat quickly....  Our drink order was taken...had to custom order our Margs....I mean who still drinks them with sweet and sour??  So we got them (after what seemed like an eternity!)  OK.....this was the one good thing about the experience.....the margs were top notch!  (but you have to remember....tequila, cointreau and lime juice...that's it NOTHING more....)  Now...on to the food....if I had to choose one word to sum it up.....wait for it....wait for it....ATROCIOUS!!  The chips were good but the salsa sucked....tasted like pizza sauce, I mean really how hard is good salsa...  I ordered.....carne asada.... ....a staple in the catalog of good Mexican fair....but  NO...it was horrible (believe it or not, I'm being kind here!)  It was a cut of meat that I'd never seen served in this capacity.......not sure what the h&ll it was...only thing I know for sure, it was bad....over cooked, and chewy...how does that happen?  Luckily, my patient and lovely girlfriend decided on the Chicken fajitas......thank god! they were at least a 7 on the scale....so we filled up on those...every once and a while taking a bite of my less than stellar second place dish!  The beans were 'ok'...the rice...well lets just say that the "San Fransisco treat' could have been a better showing!  Side note.....some one should let these people in on something...the "leather' aprons that the bussers wear.....yeah, you guessed it...they look straight out of Hostel....you know, the ones that the killers wore.....not really "setting the atmosphere" if you ask me!  All in all....the only reason I can give them two stars instead of one....the Margs.....great drinks can do a LOT to improve a bad experience!  Do yourself a favor.....skip this one all together.....  Second side note....all the 'best of Phoenix' awards don't mean squat.....if they are from the early 80's....

Foreword:  You may see that all my reviews are 5 stars (with the exception of one really horrible experience (I won't mention any names....*cough-MATADOR-cough*) reason being you may ask...I only feel compelled to share the really good ones, or really bad as the case may be ;)  Ok, to the business at hand...TDJ is HOTT from the chips with the amazing red chile salsa to the check this place is ON IT!!  I have been addicted to this place here lately and I can't get enough, what can you ask for in a good nosh spot....consistency baby, this place nails it....always good, never a disappointment!  So far I have tried about 6 different menu items...everything from the machca plate to the cheese enchiladas...right on the money!  I would say about as authentic as you can find my friends....  Not sure....but everything is soooo gooood that I may just try the "lengua" here soon....still a bit freaky, but I have to assume the same high quality will grace my plate!  Please don't be fooled by the well, quite frankly scary exterior...this place has what it needs on the inside....cold beer, amazing chips, mind blowing salsas....consistent service (even when it's busy) and great food!!  Well, what are you doing still reading this?  Don't stand on ceremony here people...run don't walk to this one!!

Oh how I love a good breakfast!       My first experience at this quaint little establishment was this past weekend, my sister, her boyfriend....my girlfriend and I decided we needed a bite to eat after a looong night of celebrating....they chose to make the trek from Gilbert to our side of town...our first logical choice laying in bed with a swelling head you ask?  Of course we had to try Matt's...after all, we had been hearing for weeks about the bountiful breakfast that awaited....       I absolutely love something about a place that can make you feel as though your a tourist in your own town...and this one does it, very small inside....no waiting area except the side walk in front....you have to "sign in" on an ordering pad (cute touch in my opinion)...any how, after seeing what we were up against....I thought the worst, you know what I'm talking about....long wait!  Thankfully I was wrong, we were sat within about 10 minutes!  (Side note, I think we were a bit lucky on timing....as we left, there were a LOT more people waiting, I believe we got there around 9-9:30)       Ok....for breakfast we all tried about the same thing....."The Hog and Chick"....fancy(kind of ;) way of saying eggs and some kind of swine....anyhow, all the basics are included here...potatoes (your choice, home fries or hash brown)  I chose home fries...and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised...with out a doubt the best I'd ever had!  Along with the potatoes there were onions and fresh rosemary....honestly the rosemary made them.  The eggs were cooked wonderfully....over easy seems like an easy fix...but its truly amazing how many times this can be a disaster.  My best friend had the ham....and let me tell ya...Nicki loves some good ham...and she got it!         I have read some other reviews of this place....some talking of prices too steep....not sure where they were coming from, but all four of us....huge plates, soft drinks and or milk....with tip about 45 dollars...not sure I would classify that as "over the top"....not for a meal of this magnitude...maybe Denny's...but hey if you want that...you know where to go ;)       Only quark with our truly wonderful experience you ask?....we got the wrong drinks....regular instead of diet....other than that, the wait staff was cheery and funny...two things that are a must with me when I'm baby sitting a hang over.  Like I said...I love a good breakfast...Matt's truly delivers!  Thanks Matt....I will be back, very soon!

Well what can you say.....beautiful atmosphere, intelligent staff and wonderfully creative food!  This place has all three!!  My girlfriend and I went for an evening out....a usual around our house, we decided to try this place that we had heard the usual "buzz" about....and we were, to say the least.....very happy with our decision that night.  The decor of the restaurant is an well thought out and simple....elegant but casual...  The flare of this quaint spot is definitely found in the bottom of a wonderful glass of the exquisite pinot noir....one of my personal favorites and found as well in the "special" that we enjoyed....we had the Ono, it was absolutely amazing....if you have a chance to wrap your mouth around this one....I would highly recommend it!!  Sorry...I would be more forth coming with description on the dishes...but to be honest, after a couple of glasses of the ol'vino....your lucky I remembered the fact I had the Ono ;)  The only draw back that I could see would be the lack of parking.....might be a downer for some....but for a typically lazy individual such as myself...the valet does the trick just fine.  All in all....want a great evening out...try this one, you will not regret it!

Sens+Friday Night=Good times!  So my girl and I figured we would walk to dinner this past Friday to one of the many new hip, downtown spots...couldn't have been a better choice for us to make!  Sens was excellent, our waitress (don't wanna try and spell her name for fear of butchering it.) was amazing, wonderful knowledge of the menu...you could tell she adored the food, so we went with it....we didn't order a single thing....just said "bring us more"...and boy was that the right call!!  SIDE NOTE: I LOVE small plates....I think more places should take this route!  I mean come on....why settle for tasting one or two items when you can have six?  Yeah, I thought you'd agree :)  As I sat there...admiring the beautifully appointed decor...drinking my signature chile infused "Hot and Dirty" martini (yes it is hot...and quite dirty...very tasty!)  I realized wow...this is the best duck I've ever tasted...really, "must try's" here include (besides the hot and dirty martini) Ginger Mint Duck salad...and my favorite of the night...the Soup Goyza, an amazing, melt in your mouth dumpling with a mixture of pork and cabbage in a broth...absolutely amazing!!  SIDE NOTE #2: ANY joint that's not afraid to play a little Puscifer is ok in my book...DJ's a great call here!  Oh....and not for nothing....the red light in the bathroom is kewl and make sure you DON'T miss the painting on the right as you pass through the red curtain...very HOT!!  Conclusion....run, don't walk to this one, you won't be disappointed!!

I will start by saying this is the first time a business (other than a restaurant) has even come close to invoking a "yelp" from me...but I had too, and if you were to use them I assume you may as well.  I'll start by pointing out what everyone wants in a home service...of any kind.  RESPONSIVENESS and actual care for a customer, BOY does Del Sol fit the bill!!  I have been through at least 4 different pool service companies over the past couple of years, now I've found the last one I'll ever use!  My first meeting with the owner went as most others until I (bare with me here) actually got the feeling he cared about me and not my money...yeah, right I know...hard to find.  The service had been going for some time and going well when suddenly my pump broke, normally wouldn't have been an issue except for the fact I was hosting a pool party in less than 48 hours!!  I know right...panic at the disco!!!!!  In any case one call to Del Sol with my plight and within hours he was there, my pump was fixed within just a few short hours....and....wait for it...AT A REASONABLE price...or at least that's how I felt, especially given the circumstances.  In any event, the party went without a hitch and pool sparkled like Kardashian's huge rock!  I give Del Sol the highest of marks, don't hesitate to give these professionals a call....you wont be sorry!

I haven't had an experience worth writing about in some time...this past weekend that changed!  My wife and I took a shot in the dark and came out with a gem, this place rocks...great atmosphere and even better food.  Small plates were so good that we never actually had an entree, we'll have to try again on our next visit.  If you have a chance, it's well worth the effort!

Honestly, I've never felt so unimportant in my life..  Compassion level seemed to be zero, empathy level even lower.  As they say, bedside manner is paramount and unfortunately, at least with me, Dr. O'Toole had a very poor one.  Unlike the previous (and only other) review she literally looked down her nose at me when comparing my anxiety issues to that of her 9 year old sons "issues", thanks Doc...I had no idea all I needed is five minutes of meditation before bed for it all to be OK!  On another issue she "enlightened" me with her knowledge (of course as unquestionable gospel) on testosterone therapy, I cant wait to tell my specialist (a Doctor who does one main thing...just one) about everything I learned today?!  The single star is for her staff, while I didn't feel very good about her, they were friendly and quite professional and the office was clean and inviting.   In any event as I said before, I felt unimportant...the very opposite of the way anyone wants to feel when visiting a doctor.  Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend her to anyone.
