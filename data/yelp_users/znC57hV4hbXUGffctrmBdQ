Fresh squeezed OJ...yum!  Food rating gets 3 stars, but I am giving 4 because I like the atmoshpere and staff is consistently friendly. I cannot count how many times I have eaten here. Surprisingly with all the awesome restaurants we have in Phoenix, and particularly Scottsdale, we are seriously lacking in the breakfast department. Not a lot of options for a good breakfast that isn't a big chain.  I always get the German Pancakes, "The Dutch Baby" (as long as I have time to wait the 20 min extra for cook time for them), they are quite delicious if you love lemon and butter as I do. Bacon is really good and consistent. Everything else to me is average. Omelet's are good, pancakes are okay...coffee is pretty good and they use cream, my pet peeve is when restaurants give you milk for your coffee instead of cream.The Hash Browns are kind of bland to me. I am always a sucker for fresh squeezed OJ.  My 4 year old eats the chocolate chip pancakes pretty good and the 16 mos old likes the silver dollar pancakes he can eat by hand.  Nothing has been as good as the old JP's Pancakes before that changed ownership, so this is the next best if you are accommodating kids and are sick of IHOP.  Beware there is usually a wait of at least 20 minutes on weekends and when snowbirds come back in the fall.

Color: Joslyn is the BEST! Have been going to her for about 5 yrs now. I have fine blond hair, and quite a few baby hairs along my hairline that do not grow. She takes her time to make sure she gets then all for my highlights.  The others there tease her about how many folis she uses. Haircut: I have seen many of them and my favorite is Courtney. She does a great job.

Wow, this is a hard one. I have been here several times for work functions and this last time for a nice Date Night with my husband. Hands down one of the most AMAZING views in town. They have these really cool high top private booths that face the sunset, and since my hubby is always planning the date nights, thought I would plan one for him.  First, I tried for 2 weeks to get a reservation at sunset. It was either 5pm with the seniors, 8pm or 9:45.  8pm it is which barely makes the sunset. Well, we were seated 20 minutes LATE (even though we were there 30 min early), but at least got to see the beautiful view of Camelback Mountain and watch the sunset from the balcony. Balcony is small and no handles on the doors so you get locked out once you shut the doors, so you have to knock to have someone let you back in!  Finally seated in our beautiful private booth. (BTW, it is $125 minimum on the weekend) We order some wine. We have to ask for bread, not automatically just brought. Bread was not that great, but before wine, I make sure to eat it! We ordered a dozen oysters, which we love. They only had 1 kind, and they were just OKAY....plus they only brought 1 TINY TINY lemon for the oysters for 12 oysters!! What?!?!  I despise horseradish and hubby loves it, was not very happy that they serve the cocktail sauce and horseradish together in the same bowl, so i have not choice by the end to eat some or ask for my own.  We ordered a bottle of Red Zinfandel. I strongly feel any restaurant that is $75-$90pp should automatically decant the wine, which they did not. At least the red wine was slightly chilled. (YES, i have become a wine snob after having lots of great wines, there is a HUGE difference when it is slightly chilled and decanted)  Dinner, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass ($32) and hubby had the New York Strip ($I think $30 something) along with a side that was a mix of quinoa, corn, green beans and much to my distaste-goat cheese. I HATE goat cheese and can always tell when it is in something. I asked the waiter if I had missed it in the description on the menu and he said no, for some reason they don't list it there and he has had quite a few complaints about it.  Sea Bass-needed salt badly. No salt and pepper were on the table, so I had to ask for it. I was pleasantly surprised the server came back w/ 3 kinds of sea salt-regular, bamboo and an alderwood type. The bamboo was my favorite and found my fish tasty after seasoning it.  Steak:Hubby said it was cooked fine but wasn't wowed by it.   Server was nice, but not what I would call fine dining material. He greeted us promptly and started to tell us the specials and then said he was getting old and forgot what they were.   Another odd thing, this restaurant is pretty large, and the bathroom in the restaurant is a 1 person bathroom. Very strange! There is another one in the lounge down the hall that is bigger.  Fun factor though there is great. in the lounge we ran into 3 different groups of people that we knew and had a great time. Then we went downstairs and just played some slots since Craps is my only real love and I don't do the video craps they have, I like the real deal.  SO, overall, great to experience it, sunset and view is AMAZING, place is hopping with all kinds of people, dining experience is subpar. I hands down would spend the money and Mastro's City Hall and just go to Orange Sky to meet up with friends for drinks when we can break away from the kiddos.

Let me first say, I am a foodie, and I eat out a lot!!  For as often as I eat here, you would think I would give it 5 stars, (I AM the Duchess of Coal Burger!) but I simply cannot. Coal Burgers when they are done right are AWESOME, but this place is so inconsistent!  Sometimes they deserve 3 stars and sometimes 5, so hence, we have a 4 star rating.  BURGERS:The first time I ate here, it was perfect!  I had the regular Coal Burger, it was juicy, not overcooked and I really DIG the Coal Burger Sauce which has Thousand Island mixed with like 5000 other things and it works!  *I typically prefer my meat Medium Rare, just FYI.... Then my 2nd trip, I was so disappointed. My burger was dry and I couldn't swallow my bites without water. I have had the Green Chili Burger and it was good, but I am just not a spicy person fan, although my husband seems to enjoy that one. I do like that you can the burgers wrapped in lettuce as an anti-bread option. Tried the Grass-Fed beef once and I wasn't impressed, but that was also on a dry-burger day so maybe that was why??  FRIES: The sweet potato fries when I do get them are always amazing. The regular fries....well, they are just fries. Nothing special. Have not had them for awhile as bathing suit season is fast approaching!  GELATO SHAKES: Well these things ROCK! My favorite is the Hazelnut Chocolate, although Banana Coconut is a close second. When I was pregnant I always ordered them, now save them for special rewards for myself.  KIDS MEALS: It is just okay. My boys get the hotdogs. My 5 year old is very picky and doesn't love bread so doing a burger is a tough one. But there are not a lot of options for kids. If they do want a shake I make them split it as they are super large for kids and do not have a "Kid's Size". They have new crayons which are always nice and a coloring sheet and is kid friendly. I can easily wheel a stroller up to the table when I need to if I am in the booth section.  CONS: It isn't cheap. Sometimes if it is just me and my 2 older boys (2 and 5) it adds up to $25 for a meal which I think is pricey. Maybe they could do a kids eat free day and more families would come in??  I am always annoyed that there isn't ketchup close by for fries and if I am there by myself with all 3 kids I have to "leave them" to go get it by the drinks.   PROS: When it is good, it is GOOD! I hope this place does make it as it is very tasty burger when done right. I cannot comment on the chicken as I will probably never order that. Also, you can usually always eat fast which comes in handy if I don't have lunch plans and am by myself because I am always in a hurry. Clean place, nice big bathroom, lots of great soda choices that are healthier even though I don't really drink soda. Service has always been great for me, I have never had an issue there with that in my 15 or 16 visits!  Overall, I hope it makes it as I do LOVE the sauce and the JUICY burger.
