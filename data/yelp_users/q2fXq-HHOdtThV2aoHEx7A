1st day for Cardinal football.  Thought this would be perfect. They raised beer prices by a quarter big deal. But the bad part is no sound for the cardinals game and they kept the juke box going.  We complained about it and they said to bad but the Dallas game that night we could listen to it.  Last year the girls could wear jerseys during football but not this year.  Thanks but no thanks

A 1 star is a generous rating.  I went back because I didn't have all day to get my car washed and they gave me a prepaid gift card for the amount of the wash since I didn't have 4 hours to kill.  They always negotiate services and I got a wash and wax and detail  for $120 (which was the amount on my card) The attendant (Simon) wrote it up as a wash and headlight polish and said it would take about 2 1/2 hours.  I went to pay for it and they wouldn't accept the prepaid card because its only for what you are replacing.  The cashier went and got Simon and he said if you want what you ordered it would be $80 more.  I told him nope  Its not happening.  I called my son to pick me up and we went to lunch since I had 2 hours to kill. He dropped me off 3 hours later and they said it would be 2 more hours.  The attendant   said they basically lie to do the sale and he gets stuck with the angry customers.  The big problem that I had on the car was I had a 12 pack of coke explode in the car and needed it cleaned up.  They really didn't wipe down the dash and they didn't spot shot the ceiling which the salesman said they would do.  The wax job that they were going to do didn't even take off a price sticker off the trunk.  Shitty job all the way around.  I can't recommend this merely bankrupt company

I go there several times a week and I rarely have a problem.  I think I have had pretty much everything on the menu over the past 8 years and its all good.  Thanks Gloria, Lance, and Derek for the great service.

I have been going to have my HP and Cannon machines worked on for over 10 years.  He is by far the fastest and most knowledgeable repair man that I have met ever.  Complete confidence in his company. Extremely fair, quick and reliable.  Thanks again Grant.

I have been a patient for over 10 years and I had LASIK about 6 years ago.  I wish I did it earlier. Dr Newman you rock!

I have eaten there dozens of times and it makes you feel like it's the old fashioned family owned diner, maybe it's because it is.  Quality ingredients make the food amazing.  I have become a regular there. 5 stars
