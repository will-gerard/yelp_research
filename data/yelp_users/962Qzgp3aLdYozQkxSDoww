Amazing service. Great beer, and the hop sauce wings are off the chart good! Highly recommend the IPA.

I took my iPhone 6 there to get the screen replaced. The person that got all my information was great. Came back in an hour and the phone was fixed. Good as new. Except there was this little bit of stuff by the home button/ Touch ID button. So the teck took the phone back to clean it up. He came back a few min later and gave me my phone back. I leave out the door, go to unlock my phone, and the Touch ID is not working. It worked when I got it back from the teck the first time, but not the second time. I went back into the store and asked them about it, and was then told that they had accidentally broke the home button, and had to replace it with a none Touch ID home button. They never told me and I guess just assumed I would not know the tuch ID didn't work any more. And was told that there was nothing they could do about it! Would never take your phone to this location. Very shady people work there.
