George & Dragon is THE place to start your new year off right!  Me and my friends have a tradition of meeting up at G&D on New Years Eve to begin our new year's celebration!  We show up around 2 PM to get a booth and spend a couple of hours gearing up for the big countdown at 5 PM, which is when the new year begins in England.  Although it is always packed during the celebration, the staff is always super nice and able to keep up with the orders from our table.  Just before the countdown begins the staff passes out champagne and party favors to everyone in the bar!  We've never had a bad experience here and plan to continue our tradition for years to come!!

This "dog park" is a joke.  Steele Indian School Park is huge and all they can offer the dogs is a small GRAVEL hill??  Dogs need GRASS...or at least dirt to run in!!    I really wish the city would move the fence so the off-leash area would include some of the large grass field that is adjacent to it so I could actually take my dog to this park to play!!

I went to Roka Akor over the weekend and WOW!!  The service was phenomenal and the food was even better!!    My date and I shared the shrimp tempura appetizer (which comes with a really tasty chili mayonnaise dipping sauce!), two sushi rolls and their shashimi tasting menu.  It was my first time ever ordering shashimi and I was a bit nervous, but our server convinced me that this was the place to try it...and man was he right!  Sooo good!  We also ordered a round of sake (be careful....it's really potent!), which our server poured for us every time.  We stuck with the basic blend, but will definitely try one of their unique sake flavors on our next visit!  Oh ya, and be careful in the bathroom!  There is a full length mirror at the end of the walkway to the stalls that can be very tricky after a round or two!    Enjoy!
