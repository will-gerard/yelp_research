This walmart is definitely a total shit and some of the employees suck.u can't find anything here also I went @8 pm to buy a cake and there was no one at that counter.they also closes their customer service center @10 pm.if u go at 10.01 pm u will find it close.how punctual they are!!then why it is written that they provide 24/7 customer service.. Ughhh..

So let me emphasize why 1 star.i wish I could give no stars for this.i ordered some photo prints online.when I edit the photos there were no '!' Sign which would say if the photos were fit to that size of prints or not.so I ordered online.n after I received those I saw our heads were chopped off in half of those photos.so I talked to customer care and they refund half of my money.after some time I again did it.i ordered online print.i order store pick up as this store is in my walking distance.so it's been 20 days since I order.n I did nt receive any call from store or any email.so I called customer care and they told me that my order has been delivered to d store.so I went there and after searching for sometime they didn't find it and the person who were searching my package told me that it's been a long time so may b his colleague threw it away.what d hell.my estimated delivery was 21st of February n I went to the store on 23rd of February.i wanted to slap myself that time fr doing the same mistake of ordering from walmart. I never ever gonna order photo prints from here.

I heard a lot about cheesecake factory before going there.it was my first time as I am not into sweet indulgence that much.we ordered nachos, garlic noodles, cheesecake factory special lemonade and tiramisu cheesecake. A lot I know.nachos was good.garlic noodles was awful. I don't know why they even call it garlic noodles. No hints of garlic. Lemonade was bad too.too much sweet.may b that's why they call it special.ughhhh.cheesecake was no doubt a good one...anyway I will go there only to have cheesecake, nothing else.

Last night it was our first time here.we went there after following good reviews.but what a disappointment. We ordered hot and sour soup, shrimp and egg noodles, Kung pao chicken, red curry chicken. No doubt soup was good.but red curry and kung pao was a total fail.i don't know why the curry called red curry.coz not even the colour was red.forget about the taste.there was a burnt flavor in kung pao.anyhow I didn't like it at all.never going back there.

Nothing to complain about.they serve the best complimentary chicken  gnochhi soup and bread.and they refill the bread too.i had stuffed chicken marshala and chicken scampi here.both are yummy. .also I had signature wine rosato rose.it was good too.service is quick.a good place to hangout with friends and enjoy some scrumptious Italian food. Only thing is I feel like stalked by the waiter all the time.just a nano second after u finish ur food, the waiter come to take ur plate. How come!!!!! :p Anyway nothing to worry about.will come here again and again for sure.:D

Perfect meat shop.fresh, good quality meats.the people, working here are humble.i come here 2 times a month.good customer care.u can have your meat as you prefer and if you don't understand about certain needs to prepare something, they always help u out.these people are good to do business with.

Though it is a place for kids I personally have seen much better park for kids.There are very minimal rides and all are old.Nothing new..

It was my frst thai food experience. Foods were really good.we ten friends went over there and ordered so many items.we took chicken and mushroom soup, fish fillet, lo mein noodle, shrimp fried rice,chilli fish, garlic and pepper chicken, cashew chicken etc.we couldn't able to order dessert as kitchen was already closed.we had to ask for our water, spoon, plates etc.i think they went a little nervous as they had to take order from 10 people at at a time.

I love starbucks. And this place is within my walking distance so I came here.one thing I noticed before also that the attendants are too busy always. I don't understand why. Coz there are always few customer whenever I go.last time I came here there were 2 boys and 1 boys attending everyone.the boy who took my order was pretty friendly and good attendant.but other two attendants were so busy talking with each other that I had to wait more than 10 mnts (though there were no other customer) and as after she gave me my coffee she had no time to say anything or to give a single reply of thanks.

Coz it is their job.damn groupon.though I do my hair here without coupon.she did a good cut and nice mild color.i love it.i want to give it a 5 star but I don't coz I wish it could be more cleaner in here.

Ladies night!! Wooohooo.live music, great energy, awesome friday night out, party, dance, music - great combo.ambience is energetic fun-filled. Only thing is they can put salt in your martini or can serve u flat bread instead of chips..:p what can u say..they are enjoying there too.so neglect these kinda fault and do ur party dance..

Literally I didn't find any difference between  gelato and a normal good quality ice cream.before experiencing I used to hear a lot about gelato and it's authenticity. But poor me,i couldn't able to understand the difference. But I love ice cream and they have a good variety so definitely a thumbs up.

Wow..what can I say.we wait for almost 20 mnts after sitting only to have a glass of water, after that another 25 mnts to have our food.though the manager gave us 10% discount for our long wait.but it is not about money.it is thoughtful to give a discount for such a long wait and I appreciate that.but it was 12 o clock at night at that time and our friend had his 1 yr old baby with him and ofcourse we were terribly hungry.so sorry but I have to give u one star for ur service.

Chipotle is my life.i lovvveee chicken bowl.this food is sooo tasty and no spices at all.i didn't imagine before I would like that non spicy food.but when I first tasted it ummm I was in heaven. .so I often take a round to this heaven.only draw back of this place is parking lot.it's a tiny miny parking lot.

This is my frst time here.and yes I am quite pleased coz you get that what you paid for.though I did not like the food that much.I went there with friends and ordered that 2 for 25 meal.I did not like the chicken florantine pizza at all.the service was impressive. And yes I will come again here to see some kind of movies..

Today was my 3rd day of zumba class and I am loving it so far.Ellie and Jenifer both instructors are kinda energy balls, creative, enthusiastic, great choice of music, u can really feel like dancing.all the girls working here r very welcoming, there are always smile on their faces that somehow gives a feeling of "let go ur worries and shake it off"..

after reading all the great reviews we went there and believe me after waiting for almost an hour(though there was only 5-6 tables were occupied) what we got a awful food.we ordered tandoori mixed grill and chicken biriyani,tandoori served with normal temperature which should not to be and what can I say for biriyani.It was salt-less and just not like as biriyani from any grain of it.when we told the waitress about it they behaved like it was normal and gave us a salt shaker.and not to mention that raita is not free here for biriyani.they charged you nearly 3 dollars for a small awkward tasted raita..we had a really bad dinner that day..:(
