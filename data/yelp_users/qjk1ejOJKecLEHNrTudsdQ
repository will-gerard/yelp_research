I love this place! I've been going here for years & it's always my first choice for my sushi nights.  The only 2 downfalls are that it is small so we have to get there a few minutes before their 5:30pm dinner opening time or else wait until later in the evening and it's decor is a bit dated.  Either way it's worth the wait. The staff is awesome & everyone who walks in gets a friendly greeting from the guys behind the sushi bar. Their creative rolls are delicious but be careful because some can get to be a bit expensive (the Fitzgeroll is $18.99).  The rolls are always a good size, not small like some of the "chain restaurants" around town.  I will recommend this place to anyone looking to have good sushi.

Terrible customer service. Rude employees (every time I've been). Reminds me why I go to Costco & not renewing membership with Sam's Club.  Extremely frustrated.  I found a table at Scottsdale store but it had a mark on it, they said they had the same one at the 15th Ave & Bell store if I wanted to go get it there or they'd give me 10% off the marked up one.  Called 15th Ave store & put it on hold for me.  I drove there, stood in their always long customer service line (with only one employee working behind desk, taking phone calls & assisting in store customers). The customer service lady rings the table up & it's almost $100 more than the one at the Scottsdale Store.  I explained they told me at the Scottsdale store that it was discounted because its a canceled item for Sams Club & not discounted because it was last one with mark on it; in fact the Scottsdale store said they'd take 10% off price if I wanted the marked one. She offered no apologies or reasoning as to why it was more at that particular store.  She blamed the Scottsdale store for not telling me they were different prices.  She was trying to rush me away from service counter.  Usually when stores have 2 different prices on same item, they give to paying customer for the lower priced one, but not Sam's Club apparently.  Now I see why Costco is always busy & Sams Club is always slow.

I get my nails done here on a regular basis & have done so for few years now.  They have always been very pleasant & it's felt very clean in there.  The past few times I've been in for mani/pedi I've noticed the regular nail techs I've used have left.  Then when I called to make an appointment with the nail tech I like the best, they said she was no longer there so I made an appointment with someone I didn't know.  When I showed up for my appointment, the nail tech I requested originally was there & available & she was surprised that they told me she wasn't there.  So I felt like there were some "politics" going on in the place.  Overall I really like this nail salon & I will continue to go back for the time being.

Do not go here if you're in a hurry! The slowest Starbucks I've ever been to & i've been here several times. Drive-through line wasn't even that long and I waited 25 minutes. I commented to The girl at the drive-through window how long my wait was she did not apologize and said well we're just always very busy....

My tip is go somewhere else! This place used to be great & used to do a nice job on my cars.  But it seems in past several months when I've brought my car in there has been a real lack of customer service & worse....they don't do a very good job on my car.  They never wipe the running boards. This past time I still had dust on the dash board & there weren't even cloth marks like they attempted to wipe it. Also cup holders still dirty.  They didn't vacuum the back seats or the even open back hatch to vacuum cargo area. I paid extra for them to wash my front mats which they didn't do & also didn't even clean my tires & wheels.  There was a total of 6 guys working, 2 cars being cleaned & my car just sat there with all doors open while no one started cleaning for at least 15 minutes. This place used to be much busier & much faster and they used to do a much better job. I complained as I was getting in my vehicle & the guy apologized but said he couldn't do anything (not even finish cleaning up the spots of my car they missed) he said I'd need to talk to the guy in charge, but he wasn't there. He said "next time  you come back ask for head guy to tell him of your displeasure"....well after several years of supporting Danny's car washes around valley, I can say that there won't be a next time.  Very disappointed in this new Jacksons Company.

Was very surprised to walk in on a Saturday night to find it not very crowded & this was after a big event at Salt River Fields.  We had a table of 7 people and our service was extremely slow.  My wings were good as usual, however the onion rings were cold (like they were sitting out waiting for the wings to be done).  Another person in our party had to have their boneless wings returned because they came out cold also. The manager did come out to replace the boneless wings & apologize for the problem.  But our service there just fell flat.  We all wished we had decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings which is right across the street.  I will probably give this Hooters another chance in the future, but if the service is the same it will definitely be the last time I go.

Wow!! The coconut shrimp is the best I've ever had. Be sure to use Tiger Sauce on the delicious fish tacos. This place is unique & worth the price for the quality of food! I work & live near here & I will definitely be a regular here. I can't wait to try the chowder!

I chose this place as my pick for our monthly girls night dinner; we go to different restaurants each month & try new places.  I was very happy we went!  From the moment we walked in the customer service was great.  They seemed a bit short staffed, however the waiter/bartender was very attentive & didn't miss a thing. I had the Notorious B.I.G burger & it was excellent.  The notorious sauce it delicious. We also shared some of their side dishes; cheese curds, sweet potato fries & onion rings; all were very good. I will definitely be going back to try the other burgers on the menu & to get more of the cheese curds.
