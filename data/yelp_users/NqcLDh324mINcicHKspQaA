I recently had my 2 cats examined by Dr. Bob at All Creatures Animal Clinic.  To sum it up the Dr. performed thorough examinations on my 2 cats in an efficient and professional manner.  As one my cats now require long term treatment Dr. Bob was emphatic and took the time to make sure myself and the wife knew how to perform needed treatment from home.    If you are looking for a caring and emphatic doctor for your animal and an awesome staff (front end and back end) to go with it without burning a hole in your wallet All Creatures is definitely the place to go!

Recently had some auto work done.  Prices charged are well within range if you compare them to repairpal.com.  Any dealer will be exponentially well above any repair average costs!  Standard warranty is 1 year on parts and 3 months labor.  They will try to sell you on providing 1 year labor for around $20 extra.

Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was "unusually" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.  Coco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars..

I would have to say my experience pretty much echos everyone else's here.. 30 minute wait for salads which were C- quality (lukewarm, soggy lettuce). I forsee another casualty just like it's next door restaurant that went belly up unless some re-organization takes place..

BJ Big Apple been around 50 years and want to stay around for another 50?  Back in the 80's I remember going in on weekend nights and the dining room and waiting area be filled beyond capacity.  Nowadays walk in on a weekend night be lucky if establishment is running at 50% capacity..   Some reasons I want to share on why I and my friends and family have reduced our patronage over the past few years.  1.  The all you can eat ribs, good price, but the ribs hardly have any meat on them.  I feel like I've been receiving half meat and half bone, sometimes more bone than meat.  2.  Steaks have either been too tough or overcooked.  3.  Chicken fried steak tastes like it came out of the freezer  4.  Mashed potatoes lost its sense of flavoring (bland taste).  I've experienced the above items identically at 2 separate locations.  I'm sure the economic conditions is a contributing factor to walk in volume.  During down times one needs to excel in food quality and service and not take shortcuts!!  Perhaps there will be a day I will give Bill Johnson's Big Apple another chance.  Until then I with them luck in future success.

Food is good.. Service is so so (to be expected on a Friday night...)  The reason for the one star is the server delivered the incorrect bill for our table.  While the waitress corrected the bill she billed my credit card for both the correct and incorrect amounts!!   My advice.. double check your dinner bill at this place..  Message to management:  Take the beef ribs off your menu.  The multiple times I've been there you're always "out."

Prices are the most expensive in the area for prime time movies.  Facility cleanliness needs some work, especially in the restrooms.

If you like that rustic, trip down memory lane type of steakhouse this is the place for you!  The food and staff were great!  Do a check in w/ Yelp you get 10% off!

If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.

If you're looking for a dining experience at Fry's deli area you're better off going to an actual sit down restaurant.  Fry's "dining style" food in the deli area is very substandard at the best.  The seating area has comfortable couches, flatscreen TV's and DSL quality wi-fi.    The annoying part is having to hear the loud fan blower going off and on everytime the outside sliding door opens and closes.

I recently took my vehicle in to Community Tire & Auto to have a coolant leak repaired.  While the coolant leak was fixed my vehicle started leaking oil in the same area the coolant leak was fixed, thus making it necessary to have the original work redone. The staff at the 32nd St location deserve a round of applause for the courtesy and professionalism they demonstrated from start to finish and for a job well done!    oh.. forgot one last note.. I'll be back!

Recently made a visit to this particular Chili's to take advantage of the $20 meal for 2 deal. Even though you getting a good deal on the food the restaurant raises prices on other items in order to break even. For example a small drink in the bar was $8!!   The food items on the $20 meal deal are sub standard at best. I had the baby back ribs (totally dried out) and the wife had chicken crispers (very greasy and no taste at all). The corn on the cob with the chicken dinner was ICE COLD and had to have it sent back to the kitchen to be replaced.   One more side note, on the way to the restroom, walked past the kitchen, and the kitchen looked like a someone lost in a food fight as there were food scraps littered on the floor throughout the kitchen area.   I always had good experiences at Chili's over the past 20 years. The experience I had with the most recent visit it will be a very long time before I step foot into another Chili's establishment.

Visited Big Guy's Sports Grill for the first time on 4/11.  The food and drinks were reasonably priced and the wings were great!   Establishment has enough flat screens so that no one will miss the action no matter where they are seated.  I look forward to visiting Big Guy's for an upcoming playoff game.

Had an opportunity to visit the establishment for the first time the evening of 11/20 to see Harry Potter. The atmosphere of the theater is upscale. While the basic movie ticket is 9.75 (cheaper than other places), you have the option of adding the D-Box seats ($8) or Star-Class featuring seat side food service ($2). Be advised you will be paying premium prices at the concessions! ($7.25 for a tube of popcorn, $3.25 for a small soda, $7 for a SMALL glass of beer!).   The seats in the auditorium were extremely comfortable and the sound system was out of this world. Non-D-Box patrons could still feel the vibrations from the sound system during the movie.   I take off one star as I feel the concession stand personnel have a few wrinkles to iron out.  I ordered a single menu item (The stariffic combo w/ a set price for popcorn, 2 sodas and 1 candy. Even 3 confused concession workers couldn't get my order right and ended up only charging me for the drinks and received free popcorn and no candy..   In addition the carmel popcorn is not made in house as I observed the popcorn was taken out of a bag (Cracker Jack?) under the counter and not from the popcorn popper. If you want fresh popcorn just order the non-flavored butter type.

Like any new establishment there's wrinkles to iron out such as making the soda fountain fully operational and making sure food prices in the registers are the same as on the menuboards.  As for signage I agree that without visible signage that can be a factor for long term success.  FYI, Brueggers offers 1 hour validated parking in the parking garage.

While the food was of great quality and the staff were friendly. I take off 3 stars for the following reasons:   1. Staff member observed leaving huge pile of ice mess on the floor after finishing transferring ice from the ice maker to the soda fountain ice bin. Staff member didn't bother cleaning up after herself! (ya mommy don't work there with you.. clean up your own mess!!).   2. Buffet serving area didn't appear to been recently cleaned. Utensils felt sticky to the hand and floors not recently mopped (floors felt sticky as well.. including the restrooms).   3. Been there 2 separate times and each time had to ask for silverware so I could eat my food! (make it a habit to bring the silverware out with the bowl or something!!).

I've been to this establishment on 2 different occasions and have no complaints.  Yes, the place resembles a neighborhood sports bar, if you want fancy and white glove service go to Lush or somewhere.  The food my wife and ate (Juicy Lucy/Mac n cheese) were of very good quality and tasted good, along with the sweet potato tots!  Establishment has ample supply of big screens to allow you to watch all your sports venues from which ever wall you are facing.

This establishment opened on 3/7/12.  Building was formerly 3 Margaritas (and it shows on the inside minus a wall or 2).  As for the service I'll just say that a lot of wrinkles need to be ironed out (if you are the manager/owner of the restaurant and reading this email me for details).  I'll spare this place and write a service review on my next visit (after the feathers have settled down..).  I rate the food a B- overall, not too good and not too bad..   If you are looking for a fancy, all out Sushi restaurant you're better off staying over in the Scottsdale area as this place looks like to be a mom/pop joint (don't confuse this place w/ Ritz Asia in NY).

Was not impressed my last visit.  Sushi quality has gone downhill or something.. What is normally cold sushi was literally at room temperature. The hot items were literally at room temperature as well.  My stomach did not feel too well for 2 days after my visit here..

Visited the establishment yesterday.  Service and food quality exceeded my expectations.  Nori Sushi has a Happy Hour from 3-6 (correct me if I'm wrong) where you can get 1/2 price drinks.

Visited the establishment for the first time on 5/26. Fish taco tasted very fresh and tasty.    While this place is a order at the counter and have food delivered to your table, they also promptly remove dishes after you have finished your meal.  Prices are in the 9-13 range for meals.. Again.. you get what you pay for when comparing to places that charge less!

I visited the establishment on 12/7 and have the following observations:  1.  I hope by the time anyone reads this review the sewer smell is fixed..  2.  Solid metal chairs were extremely uncomfortable, metal chairs will suit those only with small body frames. 3.  While I appreciate the beer samples bartender was passing around the dining room, bartender need not stand there hoping I say yes.. I ended up saying thank you politely and he eventually got the hint.

This establishment opened on 11/25/13.   The exterior and interior of the building has been completely remodeled and does not remind you of its 2 previous predecessors.  Look like there will be outdoor seating come spring time if not sooner depending on weather.  The food and service was A+!!  Lots of TVs present to keep you entertained w/ sporting events while you enjoy your wings and beer.  This establishment is off to a good start.  Keep up the good work this place should be around for the long term!

This establishment opened to the public today, I have to tell you the staff must have rehearsed prior to the opening day.  As with many restaurants I've visited on the first day one can tell there were some wrinkles to iron out as far as food and service.  With The Henry was no such things as wrinkles on a cloth..  the food and service went far... far.. beyond my extreme highest expectations.  Allow me to point out a few highlights:  1. The entire staff (greeter, host and wait staff) were very friendly and made the place very welcoming.  2.  The food and service was impeccable.  The food tasted fresh and was of very high quality.  I had the 1/2 chicken and I never had a de-boned chicken before (only bone found was the leg piece - I almost thought I've already eaten the breastbone!). Also finished drinks and plates were promptly removed by literally the next waiter/waitress that passed our table, I doubt not that many wait staff returned to the kitchen with empty hands!  3.  The establishment also has a coffee bar section with ample seating to break out the laptop and surf the web with their blazing fast wi-fi (I performed a speed test and clocked the wi-fi download speed at 10+Mbps !!).  I noticed there were like 3 other meeting rooms with TVs next to the coffee bar area and not certain if they are open for general seating during non-booked times (as I found more plug ins in there for laptops than in the main area). I look forward to chilling out in the coffee bar area after work in the near future.  As with any of the foxrc establishments I've visited I've always experienced food and service to be far superior than other restaurants I've reviewed in the past.  Keep up the good work foxrc!   As for the person who gave this place one star, I would imagine you will rate The Henry 5 stars upon your first visit! :-)

The rating for this Wal-Mart location doesn't deserve a 1 star, this is the most unwelcome Wal-Mart I've ever walked into, not worth the drive!  This place lacks customer service in all areas (too long to list).  My visit on 3/1, we had an item that did not have a barcode on it, cashier was like "can you go check the price on this?" like it's my problem there's no barcode on a item, cashier should have arranged in getting a price check rather than making me walk to the other end of the store to get the price for the item (did I mention there were others in line waiting?).  With this kind of customer service.. I will be taking my future business to Target & WInCo.

Today was my first visit to Corner Bakery Cafe.  I ordered a spinach salad and tea and both were delicious.  The atmosphere and decor is bright, charming and very welcoming.  My interaction with the staff was friendly and a lobby person picked up my plate when I was finished.  I hope I have the opportunity to visit this place many more times in the future.

Flower Child in Scottsdale employees deserve a high five!  This is my first visit to Fox's Flower Child, as the restaurant is casual (you stand in line to order, get the food brought to you at the table) the service is compared to their sister restaurant The Henry!   While waiting in line the staff keeps you busy in studying their menu (a must before approaching the cashier..) and offering drink samples.  The staff also asks if you are dining in and if so they assign you a number to give the cashier (did I mention they place the number on your table so the table is ready for you after you pay and get your drinks? - saves from having to table hunting!).  All food served at the Flower Child is gluten free, so anything you order is good for your heart, mind and soul! :-)  I had The Rebel which is a steak wrap and it had lots of flavor and tasted fresh.  The service was excellent, the food came within 10 minutes, the staff took up finished plates after eating and kept our table free of trash/straw wrappers.  If you're looking for a healthy place to eat The Flow Child is a place to go (need more restaurants like them).  Chris

The service was great and the food quality was superior when comparing to many national chains in the valley.  Hoping a location comes to NE Phoenix area in the near future!
