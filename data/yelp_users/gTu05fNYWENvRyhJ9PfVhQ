I started going to Warner Family when my NP had to shut down her private office because of it being too costly to keep open. When I was first notified that she was moving to a new office I called right away and scheduled my maintenance appointment so I could ensure that I could see her on time. I was on hold for over 30 minutes just to make an appointment. I was able to get in to see my NP and the appointment went fine. The medication I take can only be written for 1 month at a time. So they instructed me to call for a refill a week ahead of time. I found out that my insurance needed a prior authorization for the refill but gave me a suggestion for a generic equivalent while waiting for the authorization. I called and tried to explain my situation after another lengthy hold, but the girl seemed completely disinterested. She told me I would be given a call within 48 hours. Fast forward to today (over a month later) I have called at least 6 times and have always been told I would get a call back. I have been out of my medication for almost a month. I love my NP but I wonder if it is worth it. The icing on the cake was the mysterious $90.00 charge on my credit card that I have yet to be able to get a statement about. Save yourself the stress!

Choice Auto Repair did such an amazing job with my car. I was having a problem with the AC in my Nissan Sentra. Brought it in one morning and they called me within hours to tell me what was going on. It was a case of in-expensive parts, but they had to disassemble most of my car! They were completely honest about how long they expected the work to take, and recommended that I take my car to a dealership if I had any kind of a warranty. They allowed me to keep my car there until my part arrived (Tuesday - Friday) and had my car done by Friday afternoon as promised! Everyone was very friendly, and they took the time to explain (and make sure I understood!) exactly what was happening. It is so difficult being a girl getting auto-work done, I always feel like someone is trying to take advantage of my complete lack of car knowledge. I will continue to come back!

I had the most amazing experience here. This was my first high tea experience, and I was not disappointed. Wanda was our server, she was friendly, attentive, and made the whole afternoon amazing. We never once felt rushed, and you should definitely come hungry. The finger sandwiches were delicious, and you can have as many as you like. The scones were warm and flavorful, accompanied by the most delicious lemon curd, strawberry preserves and Devonshire cream. The deserts were adorable and delicious. Don't pass up the opportunity for champagne. The price might seem high at first, but Wanda never skimped on refilling our champagne flutes. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful, and the pianist was amazing. My advice, grab some girlfriends (make reservations!) and set aside an afternoon to really enjoy yourselves and the tea experience. I will most definitely be back!
