We came to Ninja for teppanyaki on New Years Eve and had a blast. The atmosphere is fun and the staff is great. I've also had sushi here before and it's one of my favorite places for sushi in the Phoenix area. If you go for sushi, you should definitely sit at the sushi bar.

The card readers at the pumps never work and I lost my gas points more than once because of it. When you go inside to pay they barely acknowledge your existence much less apologize that nothing here works. This place is more appropriately called an Inconvenience Store. I drive further out of my way to get gas elsewhere just to avoid giving them anymore of my business.
