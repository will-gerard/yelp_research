Okay, so the pizza here is good enough to give 5, (hell I'd give 6!!) stars even though they don't have the fastest service & LITERALLY up charge, even when your substituting out a meat for NOTHING. Last time we said "no sausage" & they charged $1. It's only $1, and it's SO EF-N good so who cares right??!?!! Oh, & good it is... dayyyemmm it's so "east coast rare" & delicious. It's totally worth it. Waited 35 minutes today for a carry out order (was told 15-20minutes). Was charged extra to sub out a meat & all we said was, "instead of sausage, could you just put on the cheese"... It's totally okay though because the pizza is THAT DAMN GOOD!! SO, if they run late, or overcharge, just deal... because it's IMPOSSIBLE to find such an east coast, NYC, (I'm talking about Lambardies on Spring St.) style pizza in AZ.

If you are looking for a TRUE perfumer & "mixologist" you have FINALLY FOUND ONE!! Sharon (the owner) is not only a legitimate artist & craftsman at what she does, but she's a GENIUS & innovator as well... I'm a VERY PICKY customer, if a scents top note is off in the slightest, or even slightly sweet, musky, spicy, etc. different then the original, I can tell... I love perfumes, but can't always fine a purse size, oil or  roller ball applicator in my favorite scents. As she can create / duplicate ANY dept. store scent, she has enough knowledge & know how to create the highest end boutique fragrances. From Eternity to Bond no.9, Sharon has her art down to a science!! A friend of mine that's a TRUE perfume connoisseur introduced me to Sharon, as well as all of my new favorite scents & perfumes. This friend has immense experience & knowledge of perfume & tends to like VERY UNIQUE, HIGH END, RARE smells that can only be found at stores like Barney's, or by the perfume company themselves & has had MANY fragrances made by Sharon. She not only has never been disappointed, she has a new obsession & has referred MANY people to Sharon @Lotions&Potions. So excited to have found Sharon & this new way of keeping my favorite scents on me always!!

AJ PETRUCCI helped me w/ a recent purchase & I couldn't be happier... He was nothing but helpful, honest, kind, patient & BEYOND knowledgable about the vehicles AND the purchasing system. I can't believe how much I love my new car & I feel like I got the best deal. I've needed to call back about a couple questions and had zero problems getting support when needed. THANK YOU AJ!! I can't wait to refer you!!

Used to love this place, until the manager ruined it... TERRIBLE food, EVEN WORSE service, and a manager that acts like you insulted her personally (and TAKES it personally) if you complain... After you've waited 20minutes for the mayo that they forgot on your sandwich... AFTER YOUVE ASKED 3 times lol... Just don't TELL them you've had bad service.
