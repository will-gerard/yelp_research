Had a great first experience here tonight.  It's not a big place, but the bar, dining, and patio areas are very cozy and well kept. Service was fantastic, and the wine selection was extensive. Ordered the Cappelini Puttanesca for dinner and thought it was a home run. Can't wait to go back and try something else.

This place puts a glob of ice cream in whatever size cup you order, puts whipped cream and a cherry on top of it, and calls it a shake.  I'll have to let it sit outside in 100 degree heat for two hours, so maybe it'll thaw out of the Arctic freeze it's in, and I can drink it without bursting all the blood vessels in my face and getting a hernia with the all the straining. What a rip off.

This location was recently remodeled, and I think it looks great.  This review is specifically for the bar area, as that is where I normally sit.  There are fewer TV's, but the TV's that are there are newer and larger.  I especially love the setup behind the bar.  All new tables and chairs (with seat backs) too.  It's just a far more cleaner and modern look. Sometimes less is more, and that is nicely exhibited in this recent remodel.

I tried this place out for lunch, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the gyro with fries.  It was really tasty, and the fries were done perfectly.  I'll be back to try more menu items, for sure.

Food was great, and Amber provided excellent service while handling a busy Monday Night Football crowd.

Had dinner here last Monday evening.  One member of our party received her order incorrectly.  She wanted fish, but got chicken.  The server took the plate back to the kitchen, and the manager came over to apologize and advised that it would be 8 minutes to correct.  This member of our party was really hungry, and the rest of us had our meals, so she told them to just bring the chicken back, which they did.  The manager, B.J., apologized again and asked if we needed anything else.  About 10 minutes later, he came by our table, apologized again, told us he was going to comp her meal, AND gave her 10 bucks in Chili's gift certificates.  He really went above and beyond to make amends, and we were all very impressed by and appreciative of his professionalism.  Mistakes happen, but service like this is rare.  We will be back.  Thanks again B.J.

Called before leaving my house to ask if they had the PAC-12 Network. They said yes.  I got there and waited 10 minutes before a server came over to the table that I had sat down at to greet me. I asked for an iced tea, and asked if the TV I was in front of could be changed to the PAC-12 Network.  She disappeared for another 8-10 minutes before coming back with my tea and then told me they didn't have that channel.  I left, and I won't be going back.

I was impressed here on my first visit, and I will definitely add this spot to my rotation of restaurants.  The prices are really good, based on what I got (Chicken Pho) and taking a peek at other plates that servers were bringing by my booth on their way to other tables.  It was fairly busy for noon on a Saturday, during a holiday weekend in East Mesa.  That's also a good sign. Place was clean, and service was friendly.

It really, really bothers me when servers bring you your check before you ask for it. It happened twice in the same visit here today.  This was before halftime of a football game that I was obviously watching.  So, I'll pay my tab and go to another establishment that won't seem so anxious to rush me out of their doors. I can't say I'd ever be in too much of a hurry to come here again.

Wanted to try this place out for a while, and It didn't disappoint.  Upon being seated, we were told they have a $5.99 Spaghetti & meatball with house salad special on Monday and Tuesday nights.  We tried that, and it was good.  Bread was also served. And, we tried a flight of 3 wines for $7.00.   Bill total was under $23.00 (also had iced tea) before tip.  Service was attentive and friendly.  We will be back to try other dishes!

Nice, clean place with a friendly staff. I really enjoy the chicken pho here, and their prices seem very reasonable.  My concern with this place is that there aren't many customers whenever I have been there.  Tonight, I was the only customer in the whole place.  I know it's Tuesday, but my visit was during the 6pm-7pm hour.  I find it hard to believe that any business can survive very long that way.  I hope I'm wrong.  If you've never been here, give them a try.  The sooner, the better.

Had the Thai Fried Rice with chicken, medium-hot. It was delicious. Also ordered a cucumber salad, and it was crisp, tasty, and refreshing.  The service was incredibly friendly and fast.  I will be back, for sure!

Dave Markus is extremely professional and informative.  He is very detailed in his responses to any questions or concerns that I have, and he shows a genuine interest in making sure I am getting the information and coverage that I need.  Get in touch with Dave for your insurance needs.  You'll be glad that you did!

This is a great place!  All of the classic arcade games brought back lots of happy memories from back in the day.  Went here on a whim, looking to do something different than going to a bar or movie on Friday night, and had a blast.  Check it out if you have a chance!

No issues here.  Ticket sales guy was friendly, concessions were quick and friendly, theater temp was nice and cool, and seats in the theater were fine.

Night before Thanksgiving, and the service from Kelli and Whitney was excellent.  The food was great, and the atmosphere was very nice.  Looking forward to coming back again soon.

I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while, so I thought I'd stop in for lunch.  The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the place was clean.  I ordered a gyro pita pocket with a side of rice.  The lamb and beef were tender and tasty.  Rice was average.  I got that and a fountain drink for just about 9 bucks.  Not a bad deal.  I will be back to try some other items.

I was in the area for lunch, and I thought I'd phone in an order for pickup.  The lady that answered the phone was nice, and I detected a slight bit of surprise when I told her I wanted to place an order for pickup.  I'm not sure why, but I just got that feeling.  Anyhow, I ordered an Italian Melt and she said it would be ready in just a few minutes.  Place was small, but cozy.  Cashier was friendly (I am assuming this was the lady that took my phone order), and she handed me my order in a plain, brown paper lunch sack.  I brought it home, and found the Italian Melt very warm and quite tasty.  Overall, a really good experience.  I would return if I happen to be in the area again.
