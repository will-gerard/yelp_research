Ray glasses is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. They are extremely helpful and their selection is very fashion forward.

The anticipation of going to SumoMaya was big but so was the disappointment.  My friends and I thought we would try it for the first time and we went on a Sunday during happy hour.  The food was good but nothing amazing but the most disappointing part of the experience was the service.  It was as if the waitress was going through training or should go through training.  She took a long time to come back every time we ordered something and our drinks sat at the bar for 10 min before I asked another server to bring them to us.  Every part of the mail was disjointed.  I think there was a manager on duty but all she did was walk around and talk to the bartenders it did not seem she has any idea of what was going on.  I think it would be a good idea for leadership to review their systems and staff and determine how they could be more efficient.  I wish them the best but until these systems are in place I will not be going back.   Sincerely  Very disappointed customer
