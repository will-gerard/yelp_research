My wife and I love any of their things with the chicken in it. It is amazing. So far everything we have gotten from there is so good. The Arizona Burrito is great, and so are the fajitas.

Best green salsa and chips to start things off. The tortas are what we go there for. The bread is fresh made daily and so tasty. You won't regret it. Make sure you get a lot o that salsa so you can dip your torta in it.

This place isn't what it's cracked up to be. We were downtown and decided to go. We heard from some friends that this place was really good. They said they have the best carne asada but it's actually just mediocre.   If you want really good Mexican food you should try out Los Taquitos, they have the best Mexican food in the valley. They were also featured on diners drive-ins and dives, so that gives them a little bit of cred.

Matt was great, he came to my rescue after my failed attempt to clean my own vent. He obviously loves what he does and is great at it. I would recommend to anyone who is having issues with their dryer not drying or if the dryer fuses keep going out.

I had one window broken from the 2010 hail storm that I never took care. I also had a bathroom window that I broke trying to swat a fly with my hand. I called Mark and left a message on his phone he called me back very soon after and was very nice and helpful. He asked me to text him pictures of the windows which I did later that day and minutes later he texted me back  with a reasonable quote and a time frame of when he would come. On the day that he replaced the windows he was there around the time he said he would, he was very fast. He was also very nice to my daughter and wife, who were the ones there at the time. I would highly recommend Garcia's Windows and more!

Being over on this side of town I was looking at places to eat this caught my eye on yelp. The burger was great, the bacon hot and crunchy and above all the fries were amazing. If I lived on this side of town I would eat there often. The selection sodas is overwhelming because they were so many. I had a cream soda. It was really good.

We went here last night with some friends that love this place. I am a big time Mexican food snob. I like mine authentic and spicy. This place is anything but authentic. Let's start with the salsa, the red salsa was about the only good thing therg, the green salsa was sweet, I can see some salsas being a litte sweet but this stuff was sickly sweet, not so good. Then I ordered the chimichanga with green chile pork. The fried tortilla was the only good thing on my plate. The meat inside was super dry and again it was sweet, not a good thing in my eyes. If I want sweet food I would have some cake or some St. Louis BBQ. I don't even think it was the green chile pork. The beans had too much of a smoky flavor, I could see if it was more of a smoky bacon or pork flavor but it didn't.   The only good thing that night was the waiter. He was great. If you want great Mexican food this is not the place, go to someplace like Los Taquitos

If you have ever had a Crown Burger in Utah and crave them, the Haven Burger is an even better burger. The pastrami is amazing and the burger is perfectly cooked over a flame. The fries and onion rings were good as well. I can't wait to go back.

We had an overgrown mesquite tree in our yard that desperately needed trimmed. Josh, Geoff's foreman, came out and trimmed and thinned it out. They did an outstanding job. I would definitely recommend these guys to anyone needing to get a tree trimmed. They were very courteous, and very nice. We even talked about great BBQ restaurants around here that they should go to. In the end I was extremely satisfied with their work and will call them again for more tree trimming.

A friend took us to Joes a few years back when we were in California. We loved it. It had the best Italian ice and THE BEST soft serve ice cream I had ever had.  We were reintroduced to it while on a trip to Disneyland and fell in love with it all over again. While we were there we found out they had one open In Tempe. We wetn there tonight for our anniversary and it's still the best. Don't go to 31 whatevers or Coldstone. Go to Joes and have a Joe Latti you won't regret it. Then tell your friends!
