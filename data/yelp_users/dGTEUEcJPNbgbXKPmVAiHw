Prices average. Horrible wifi. Location nice and next to the lake. But if you're coming here to study they play the music way too loud. With/without headphones. The music shouldn't be blasted.

Usually when I come to this location staff is always on top of everything, welcoming etc. Christopher this evening was exceptionally rude.

Got food poisoning from the tortilla soup. So I wouldn't recommend that. Hesitant to recommend anything actually. I was the only one who got SOOO and got sick so my friends made it out okay Waitress could have been more attentive to our waters being out at the table Etc.

5 stars because every time I have been here I have not been disappointed! We always come here after picking up/dropping off at the airport since its ohh ~9 minutes away! Really great spot too if you're coming for lunch. Service is really fast.   Food taste delicious. Salsa bar is huge!  Huge fan of the el gaucho and the la santiama tacos. The mahi mahi here is also beyond delicious. I've always found that 2 tacos al la carte is perfectly fulfilling but my brother loves their burritos!

Attempted to come here many times. Usually just for coffee and rarely ever breakfast. This location is way too slow, and everyone inside always seems dazed, perplexed and confused about what needs to be done. Breakfast needs to be fast and seem less, so if you don't want to be late for work.... don't come here.

Good food. Horrible service. Kitchen takes way too long to produce breakfast/brunch foods

You guys need to work on your black coffee in the morning. Either it's bitter, or watered diwn not typical of the DD coffee im used to

Little on the expensive side, but I usually don't paying more $$ for good food and good ingredients. Usually don't have any complaints when I go there. However 2 things from my trip this evening. On the California Cobb the guac scoops are WAY too small for a large salad I kind of expect at least two scoops. That's just being nit picky I guess but I want what I pay for.   Second, soups are way too salty. I want to go here to eat healthy, not to drink sodium.
