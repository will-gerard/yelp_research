What awesome food, atmosphere, and service! Eric and his staff made our dining experience amazing by helpful suggestions on the menu. Always made sure we were well accommodated by filling our drinks. Hint, you will get far more than you paid for with large portion sizes. A dining experience you will always want to repeat. Thanks!
