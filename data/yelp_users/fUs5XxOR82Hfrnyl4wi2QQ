Just went there with my family for a late lunch on Wed, 6/29/11.  It was about 2:30 pm and we were happy that they were open and still serving.  We have been going to Ruffino's for over 20 years, off and on, and still like it.  I am writing this review just to give readers some recent feedback.  Ruffino has a limited menu, but pretty decent food and prices.  Nothing outstanding, but decent and worth your time if you want to try their offerings.  My wife ordered their clam linuini, lunch portion, and it was good and substantial.  My daughter ordered the lunch manicotti and that too was decent and substantial.  Lunch does not come with anything -- no veggie, no salad -- just the entree and bread.  I ordered the dinner order of veal masala and it was good and came with veggies, side pasta, and side salad.  The price was fair.  We ordered and shared an antipasti platter to share first, and it came with two kinds of cheese, two kinds of olives, artichoke hearts, ham, procuitto, salami, mortadella, sweet and hot peppers, and about four big leaves of romaine.  Pretty substantial.  So I just wanted to report that it was pretty good and we will go back, but next time on a Thurs, since Thurs is Osso Bucco day.

It's been 4 years since I have been here and decided to go again since we wanted some Italian food for dinner.  Overall, an enjoyable experience with a few bumps.  We used a Groupon voucher and it seems that many other diners were doing the same too.  The place was pretty busy -- not packed, but pretty busy.  Some comments to share -- some good, some not-so-good, but nothing totally negative.  We arrived and were seated quickly.  It took a while for our waiter to come to the table (maybe like 10 minutes) and took our drink order, and I also asked for water for the both of us.  Our drinks came in an expected amount of time, but we did not get our waters until about 15 minutes later (I always have to drink some water or iced tea when I eat something).  My GF said her Sangria was OK and so was my cab -- Pretty plain as house wines go, but maybe a little pricey @ $9 per glass.  Appetizer plate was an antipasta platter that we shared -- plain and uninspired, but OK.  The pita bread was outstanding -- maybe more like thick, fluffy Naan bread.  We loved it.  Dinners were ravioli caprese and fungi and scampi alfredo.  Both dishes were very good.  Our  antipasta platter was delivered to us 2 minutes after we ordered, and our entrees came within 7 minutes after that.  Pretty damn fast.....somebody wanting a slow romantic dinner would probably have been disappointed, but we were not since I wanted to get home to watch the football games.  No dessert since we were full, and we were out of there within 1 hour total.  All-in-all, an enjoyable date night out!

Yeah, the service is slow due to the cutbacks in staff.  But all-in-all, this place has good food and good prices.  One of the best Vietnamese restaurants, in our opinion.  Contrary to popular opinion, they are not related to the one in Tempe.  Give them a try.

OK; we were there again yesterday for lunch.  My wife and I decided to have a big lunch and skip dinner and watch all the games on TV last night.  We ordered about three entrees and three appetizers.  Service is a little slow due to staff cutbacks due to the economy, but the food is still excellent and the prices extremely reasonable.  We know the owner since we frequent there a lot and he said that business was still very slow.  You readers should try them -- you will not be disappointed and the food and prices are good.  Give them a try -- I would hate to see this place go under due to the economy.

Went again for lunch on 6/29.  Only one gal waiting tables and they were pretty busy for lunch.  But she did a good job and relatively speaking the service was good and our food came out fast.  We ordered about three entrees again and two appetizers.  As usual, everything was good and the prices are still "right".  I guess you can say that this place is not the greatest Vietnamese restaurant in town, but it is pretty good, the service is good and friendly, and the prices are great.  More people should give it a try!!

The name has now changed.  I think the new name is Pho something, although the signage on the building still says DragonFly.  The original owner and his wife are no longer working or cooking there.  They moved to California, but the owners parents now keep the restaurant running.  The service and friendliness is still very good, but the food yesterday was mediocre at best.  I don't know if we just had a one time bad experience, but the food was not very good.  We ordered some Pho and the broth was not up to standard and the ingredients were mediocre at best....and the veggies were very sparse.  Just some basil and a handful of beansprouts.  The egg rolls seemed as though they were old and warmed over leftovers.  You could definitely tell that they were not fresh.  And my wife's crepe was super greasy and inedible!  So we probably might not go back again, even though we have been frequenting this established ever since they opened years ago.

OK; I thought I would add my two-cents here.  Been going to this restaurant off and on for like 20 years.  I still think it is a pretty good place to eat Cantonese food.  Again, not outstanding, but not bad either.  I often find it interesting that some people who write reviews about ethnic restaurants think the restaurant is bad when they do not eat the authentic ethnic dishes --- go figure?  Why go to a Cantonese restaurant and eat sweet/sour chicken and egg foo yueng?  Wifey and I went for lunch yesterday.  I took her shopping in prep for our out of town trip this coming weekend and we got hungry.  So we decided to go and eat here again.  I ordered a whole roast duck in a take out container and also two pounds of roast pork.  For our sit-down orders, my wife ordered her wor wun tun soup and I ordered Chinese beef stew lo mein.  My wife always orders her wor wun tun soup if she feels like eating something soupy, since it is always pretty good and consistent.  I like Chinese beef stew (naunam) over noodles and this dish was pretty good too.  We also ate a little roast pork and some roast duck out of the take out containers but took most of the duck and pork home.  Why did I order so much duck and roast pork? -- Because my two dogs love this stuff.  I hand strip the meat off the duck bones and they gobble down the duck and roast pork for their dinner.  They must have eaten at least $20+ for their dinner last night.  Then they had vanilla and strawberry ice cream with strawberry syrup for their dessert, while I was watching the Dbacks game.

Was in the neighborhood and decided to try this place for lunch.  I was very dissatisfied.  First of all, their prices with drink, are higher than Golden Corral, and their food sub par, both with respect to quality and selection.  On the salad bar, the romaine was yucky - wilted, brown, and some pieces with spoiled, black splotches.  Funny, since the iceberg lettuce selection and the spinach was nice and fresh...I assume the manager was asleep at the switch.  Two or three of the chicken dishes were overcooked and dry, as was the marinated (?) pork dish.  The steamed fish was dry and smelled bad; like the fish was old.  And some veggies were squishy, overcooked like what you get in the deep south.  And no beef selection.  It just was not a good dining experience.

This is the second Applebee's that I tried in the last year.  I went again to this one for a simple lunch with a friend, and we decided to try the 2 for $20 special again.  Once again, I was disappointed -- so I must remember to honor the old saying, "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice shame on me".  We shared the one appetizer, and we selected the fried mozzarella sticks.  They were bad and hard.  My friend order the SW shrimp and pasta dish and that looked pretty bad (I did not get a chance to taste it).  I ordered the three cheese pasta and grilled chicken.  There was some cheese on the pasta -- I could taste it, but there was no sauce or liquid -- just dry, cooked pasta, that tasted cheesy.  And my chicken was burnt and dry and overcooked.  The whole dish was disturbingly dry and bad!!    I know that what they show on their TV advertising and on their menus are "doctored" and "made up" dishes to make them "show" better for advertising purposes.  But what they actually serve is pretty bad and that is a travesty.    I think the other "semi-fast food" places like Olive Garden, Chili's, and Red Lobster, have better food.  And I think Applebee's would be better off (or perhaps their customers) if they provided small salads instead of the sickly "one appetizer to share" option.  So if anyone ever sees me write another Applebee's review, slap me up against the side of my head!!

OK; here is my input.  I have been here maybe 4-6 times over the last 15 years.  Still an "average" place for sushi and Japanese food.  The prices are slightly on the high side, but not outrageous.  The entrees and combos (teishoku) are average.  But the reason why I keep coming back (yes I know, not that often) is because my wife is a shrimp tempura freak and she says that they have the best tempura in the Phoenix Metroplex.  I have to agree...there are no good Japanese restaurants that know how to make good shrimp tempura.  Every watch that chef on Iron Chef?  Masaro Marumoto (???).  He always tells you how to make good tempura.  Whenever we go out-of-town, we got to go to a good tempura place to satisfy my wife.

Went again last week with my wife.  She had their shrimp tempura and beef teriyaki combo lunch and I had their Korean rice bowl with various sashimi pieces and veggies -- very good.  The owner, who is Korean, also told me that I can order some Korean dishes the next time and if they have the ingredients, she would make them for me.  I thought that this was nice and I appreciated her willingness to satisfy my craving for some hard to find Korean dishes.  We still like this place.

I cannot understand how the other yelpers could give this place good reviews.  My family and I went for lunch yesterday -- there were 6 of us.  Prices are not cheap, so you would expect some decent menu offerings and good food.  However, this was not the case.  I ordered some deep fried calamari as an appetizer with a so called lime-chili dipping sauce. The calamari was tough and very bready, and dipping sauce came out of a bottle -- very disappointing.  I also ordered a chef's salad.  Not a very good offering of salad materials and my ham and turkey topping was pressed deli crap, not real turkey meat or ham.  My friend ordered a prime rib sandwich.  Meat was not prime -- tough and tasteless and perhaps USDA Select grade of meat.  My granddaughter ordered breakfast and her bacon was cold and tough, like it was left out and cooked yesterday.  My son ordered Buffalo wings as an appetizer -- nothing special.  And he also ordered a supreme club sandwich.  Not very supreme with respect to its ingredients and they used plain white bread.  Grandson ordered some pasta primavera with shrimps -- he said it was rather tasteless.  And my DIL ordered a nondescript salad and some similarly nondescript egg rolls.  I have had better food at places like Chili's or Applebee's.

OK; last nite I have this $75 restaurant.com coupon for dinner, so I made reservations for myself, S, and K at Annabelle's at the Arizona Golf Resort. Then we found out that S' kids would be driving up from Yuma so they joined us too. When we got to the restaurant, we were told the Annabelle's is seasonal and they are closed cause it is now their off-season. WTF? Why didn't they tell me that when I called and made the reservation? So we had to eat in the grill (coffee shop) and the menu was like a burger joint menu with a few Annabelle additions to it. The apps were mediocre, the salad OK, the soup was good according to S, but our steaks were crappy. They only had sirloin as opposed to the thick cut NYC, and these steaks were about 1/2 inch thick. Everyone ordered theirs medium well, while I ordered my char-rare. Well, suffice it to say I got medium-well too! The steamed veggies were OK and the Parmesan fries were good. For dessert, K had chocolate lava cake, and the kids and S had cheese cake. Everyone said the desserts were OK, but nothing great. S said her cheesecake from Vegas is far superior. K said she thought they ran across the street to Jack-in-the-Box to get the cheesecake and choc lava cake that they ordered. Our server was good and efficient, but overall service was slow, since she was the only server there and she was also the bartender. WTF???!!! The biggest issue is I paid premium, white linen prices for coffee shop food.

OK; I know I am a non-learner, but this time I mean it!!  This is the last time I go to this place.  We went for dinner last night because we felt that we could have a nice Xmas Eve dinner here.  Well, it was OK, but far from what I wanted or expected.  Let me begin by telling you that they have been advertising that they have a new chef with a new menu that is great!  NOT!!  I call to make reservations for dinner and ask if Annabelle's Restaurant is open for dinner since the last time I went, I called and was told "yes" but in fact the restaurant was closed and we had to eat in the coffee shop.  I was again told yes.  I also ask if the menu is the same as what is showing on the website and I am told yes.  We get there and order a couple of cocktails and start to peruse the menu.  First thing I notice is that there are no appetizers on the menu except for shrimp cocktail.  WTF?  Are you kidding me?  What kind of semi-fine dining restaurant has no appetizers?  And the rest of the menu bears no resemblance to what is shown of their website.  WTF?  So I ask if we can order from both the coffee shop menu as well as the restaurant's menu and they tell me yes.  That is a relief since I ordered some onion rings with some smoked chipolte dipping sauce and some nachos with chicken -- both appetizers are pretty good.  There are four of us and we order as our dinners chicken ala king over angel hair pasta, chicken marsala, shrimp scampi, and a NY cut steak.  The dinners are MEH at best and they have no french fries or baked potato for my steak.  They do have mashed potatoes, but I am not a mashed potatoes fan.  Salad of mixed greens and Caesar salad are fine.    But the dessert menu is pathetic and only one of us orders dessert -- a chocolate lava cake that looks like a Mac truck ran over a chocolate cupcake and they scrapped it of the road.  The bill is $150 for four of us --- not expensive, but not cheap either.  But I think I can do better at another restaurant.  So today, I am cooking/making (with my girlfriend) our Xmas day dinner for the family.  It will be super good.  If anyone is interested, send me a message or email and I will tell you what we are having.

I am writing this update just as a follow-on to my recent review of Sweet Tomatoes.  We went to SouperSalad! yesterday for lunch.  Compared to Sweet Tomatoes, the salad material was better, the dressings were thicker and richer, and their tuna noodle salad had lots of tuna in it.  They also had Thai peanut noodle salad and that was very flavorful and good!!  Only thing was that their soups yesterday were mediocre at best.  But being cheaper than Sweet Tomatoes, I think they are a better deal and I enjoyed their food a lot more!

I can't believe I have never written a review on this place.  I even noticed that my son wrote a review for the one time I took him and his family there for lunch.  So having said that, I will tell you that I love this place -- It may not be the best BBQ in town, but it is pretty good and the prices and portions are more than fair.  I go here to eat mostly lunches with my GF about 2-3 times a month.  They accept restaurant.com coupons so it really is a good deal.  And once in a while, I order the family style package for dinner -- three meats, 4 sides, rolls, etc......very good and filling.  And the service is great.  The gal who runs the front is a gem!  I don't know if she is one of the franchise owners, but she does an excellent job!!

As an expat Hawaii guy, my family still loves "plate lunch" kind of foods.  So although Aloha Kitchen does not have great food, it normally is a relatively decent and passable place for us to pick up some plates when we are craving plate lunches and are too lazy to cook ourselves.  But in my opinion, this place is slowly getting worse.  The slight price increases are understandable and that is not the problem.  The problem is that they hire all these young kids who are sometimes more interested in farting around than paying attention to business.    So yesterday my wife and  daughter wanted plate lunch stuff so they called in the order and called me at work to go pick the food up.  My wife warned me that I should open each box to make absolutely sure that the order was correct, since the last three times they screwed something up.  So when I got there, the food was ready and already all packed up.  I wanted to check the boxes, but the girl said the order was all there and read the order back to me.  Since she said the order was all there, I took her word for it and took the boxes home.  Upon getting home, my wife opened up the boxes and two out of four of the boxes were wrong.  Yeah, the entrees were seemingly correct, but the salads and sides were all wrong.  Boy did my ass get chewed by my wife for being so stupid for trusting  those young dufess kids!!  Further, my wife ordered the hot wings for her meal and the wings were not hot wings -- they were more like honey glazed wings and my wife said that they either changed the recipe or made a mistake.  My daughter ordered the bulgoghi, and that order was correct but apparently the meat was over-soaked in the soy marinade and it was super salty, super dark, and the meat was disintegrating due to being marinated for too long.  The order for teri-chicken was OK, but the order for fried saimin was disappointing.  The menu and the history of this dish at this place (like 25+ years) says that one of the condiments on the noodles is slivered char siu (sweet red roast pork).  But there was no char siu in the dish, only slivered, old, left-over, over-marinated bulgoghi....maybe that is why our bulgoghi meal was not very good -- they had a lot of old, leftover, over-marinated meat so they gave it to us and used some of it on the fried saimin.  There have been many competitors to Aloha Kitchen open Hawaiian style plate lunch places but most, if not all of them have gone under.  But as a plate lunch expert and aficionado, I can tell you that a good plate lunch place will be a gold mine here.  Not only expat Hawaiians and lovers of plate lunch foods, but even the other people will love those kind of menu items.  The problem with the other places and Aloha Kitchen as well, is that the food is not that good, and the menu choices are not typical of authentic plate lunch choices.  I understand the issue of cost control and menu standardization, but menu choices can be increased by  changing the menu for different days of the week, or, having a new special of the day each day.  Oh well, what do I know?  I have only run about 30 large corporations and small businesses successfully, so my ideas and opinions must be worthless!

I think the ownership has changed.  The people who are running this place now are poor at providing customer service.  What a shame.  I have tried to eat lunch at this place three times over the last month (since the ownership changed) and each time they demanded cash only since "the credit card machine is broken".  WTF?? For a whole month?  If you stopped taking credit cards just say so.  Today when I went to check again, they again said the credit card machine is still broken.  So I declined to eat there and then the manager said "don't you even have seven dollars for lunch?"  WTF.....what business is it of theirs how I manage my finances.  I use my credit card for almost everything other than when I am just buying a drink at the Seven-Eleven.  That is how I maximize my bonus points and kick-backs and that is how I track all my expenditures too.  So if you want to be treated like an idiot go there to eat.  If not, don't go because you will certainly be disappointed.  I wonder how long before this place will go under too?

I ran into an ex-waitress of this restaurant recently and I was told that the ownership indeed changed and that the new owners were clueless.  Hence most of the staff left (allegedly).  I also heard that this place has now gone out of business.  Anyone know if this true?

OK, OK, OK -- now I proved it, all my myself.  My wife always says that I am an idiot, but I just proved it (again)!  I am making some Asian stuff for dinner tonight and I was too lazy to drive up to Mekong Plaza so I went to Lee-Lee again.  While I was there, I picked up what I was looking for and then thought that perhaps I should make a big roasted pork butt for dinner tomorrow night.  But at the meat case their pork butt is cut into thick steaks and there is no cut that is suitable for roasting.  So I went to the meat counter and asked the guy there if they had a big piece of pork butt that I could make a roast out of.  Since he didn't speak English, he couldn't help me so he called over two other guys.  None of these guys spoke any English so they just looked stunned and walked away.  I went to ask the manager and he was too busy talking to his friend to help me -- he said that I should come back "later" and maybe he would help me.  WTF????  Again, crappy customer service.    But I always believe that things work out in the end.  One of these days, these guys will wake up and find that poor customer service will eventually kill their business.  But for now, I will definitely shop at Mekong Plaza instead of here.

I have been here two times now.  The first time was over a year ago when my GF took me there for lunch.  We enjoyed it but I do not remember what we ate.  Today, we went for lunch again since BJ's sent my GF a birthday coupon for one free meal.  So we went and she had two chicken tacos in pita bread with chips and salsa.  The chicken tacos, especially in pita bread was super delicious or so she said.  The chips were fast food quality but the avocado dip and the salsa were very good.  I ordered their double brewmaster deluxe burger -- that is two 5 oz. patties with two slices of cheese, bacon, onions, tomato slices, and lettuce -- it comes with a boatload of fries.  It was very good.  A side note --- the have a half pound bacon cheese burger that has essentially the same ingredients but with only one slice of cheese and an 8 oz. patty.  Why would anyone order that for the same price as my double brewmaster deluxe burger???  We ordered two soft drinks too.  They gave her a birthday cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday.  We were stuffed and the food was good.  I was impressed, especially with the birthday coupon.

Went there for lunch today with my wife since we saw a good review in the paper.  We were kind of disappointed.  I had the menudo--while a big bowl, it was not very flavorful.  And we also ordered three of the standard (small) tacos - fish, canitas, and carne asada.  Fish was very skimpy and not good.  The carnitas and carne asada tacos were also poor -- meat chopped into itsy-bitsy pieces and overcooked.  It was like eating bits of dried and flavorless cardboard.  We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food.

I was disappointed.  I have not been to a Sweet Tomatoes restaurant for about 3-4 years due to their higher prices, but I went to join a friend for lunch on Friday.  Their pricing is still high -- about $12 for lunch and a standard drink.    The salad selection was sparse.  A few green salad types and additives.  Dressings were thin and not very tasty.  Toppings were sparse -- no cold cuts of chicken, pepperoni, nor any bacon crumbles.  And even the soups were not very hearty or tasty.  I remember them being better some years ago.  I think I will stick with the salad bars at SouperSalad!, Golden Corral, or even Sizzler's.  Better salads and better prices.

Yup; one of the very few five star reviews that I do!  I found this place quite by accident.  I need a piece of luggage repaired; a wheel replaced.  It was a Delsey piece and the Delsey people sent me 4 (I needed only one) wheels since their parts are warrantied for life.  But I had to find my own repair shop.  Their authorized repair center was in central PHX so I went to this place since it was closer to me.  The guys did a great job replacing the wheel, and he had to cut open the liner since there was no zipper.  But he hand stitched the cut back together and it looked fine.  And the best part is he charged me only $20 to do the job!  I will use him again if I ever need luggage repaired or leather work done.

I would give this place 3.5 stars.  Went for lunch yesterday with my GF.  This place is .5 miles from our house and we were in a rush for lunch since we got detained at home by a late contractor doing some work.  So we decided to give this place a try.  I am a stickler for good Cantonese food and was not expecting much.  But I was pleasantly surprised with the food and the pricing, which were both pretty good.  We had sesame chicken (I know, I know -- this is white people's Chinese food, but my GF loves sesame chicken) which was very good.  We had fried tofu with assorted veggies in a brown sauce which also was very good.  I ordered Mongolian beef which was good and it was served over a bed of deep fried mai fun, which I really don't care for, but it was OK.  And lastly, I ordered beef chow fun which was good too.  The noodles were thinner (not the width but the thickness) chow fun noodles which were OK but I like the thicker chewier kind.  But all in all, the dishes were good and the prices appropriate @ $8.95 per dish.

Decided to try this place for lunch today, since we are always looking for different and good places for a quick lunch.  We were rather disappointed.  My GF ordered a cup of chili and some chicken tacos with a side order of string cut fries.  The fries were OK, but the cup of chili was canned chili, and some cheap canned stuff as well.  The chicken tacos were made with boiled shredded chicken on some cold flour tortillas with some salad material thrown on top of it.  Not a very good lunch at all.  And to top this off, they charged her $.50 extra for cheese on the chili, and $.50 extra of chopped white onions.....maybe about 1 oz. each; and there is no mention of this upcharge for chili toppings.  I ordered the GodMother Sub....supposedly "not for the faint of heart".  I have had a better Italian sub at Subway and for about $6 less.  It came with string fries too (OK), and I ordered a small green salad.....nothing special and dressing from a bottle.  To be fair, this meal was not horrible, but I was expecting something a little better......Red Robin, Chili's, Applebee's all have lunches and sandwiches that were better.  And their competitor right in the same shopping strip mall, Copper Still Moonshine Grill, has better food.

OK; I agree that Diamond's customer wait time is long.  But that is because there is only one cook (the owner).  And I agree that it could be cleaner, from the walls to the floors to the bathrooms.  But come on, it is not that bad.  Those that are very critical probably don't frequent quaint, small neighborhood ethnic places.  When these people travel, they only stay at the Westernized hotels and eat at the westernized restaurants, I suspect.......ha, ha, ha.....I am being overly dramatic here.  But the real deal is that Diamond's has the best, authentic Cantonese food in town.  After Silver Dragon on the West side closed down, Diamond's is all that is left....maybe Asian Cafe Express in Mesa can also be included on this list.  But if you are not familliar or looking for old style authentic Cantonese food, don't go here.  Oh sure, they have Chinese-American dishes too, but those suck, in my opinion.  And the best part is that their prices are more than fair.

OK; took my wife for her Mother's Day lunch because she wanted to have Spicy Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab (fried).  Still the lowest price in town for Dungeness crab @ $13.95.  I think even this price was raised a little due to Mother's Day, but still a deal.  We also ordered the deep fried spicy calamari, pork chow mein, roast pork, bat jun tofu, and Chinese broccoli (gailan) with beef.  The roast pork was a little too salty, but still good.  Everything else was good, as usual, and I still think this is one of the best Cantonese places in town.  I have no complaints -- the service was a little slow as usual, but they were pretty crowded with the Mother's Day customers.

Just an update. Stiil pretty good food and great prices.  Went for dinner on Saturday, 7/16 and order 8 dishes.  We were not disappointed.  Read my previous post for detail, but just wanted to say that we are still fans.

An update here.  On Saturday, I ordered some take out and a whole 25-30 pound roasted suckling pig for a pig-out dinner with my children and my grandchildren -- just seven of us.  The pig was great, but we all wished the skin could have been crispier.  Some parts were crispy, but some parts were chewy.  I think this is because of the difficulty in roasting a whole pig in an oven as opposed to over a fire (spit roasting style).  But their prices for a whole roasted suckling pig is the best you will find in town --- $150 for my size, $170 for the next bigger size, etc. etc.  And the taste is pretty darn good.  The take out I ordered was good again, but I asked that the roast duck I ordered not have the sauce poured on it.  But unfortunately it did.  The owner who does the cooking is pretty good as a chef, IMO, but his customer service skills are the pits.  And he is pretty rude too.  I told him about "no duck sauce" and he yelled and said yeah, yeah, yeah --- but unfortunately, his ability to comprehend and follow instructions leaves much to be desired.  I will go back because I love the menu, the taste, and the prices.  But again his customer service really sucks big time.

I sent in a question to Cox.com asking if they had white page directory service since I was looking for the telephone # of an old friend. The answer from the customer service was, "unfortunately we cannot answer that question over the internet"......WTF? I guess they have idiots in the customer service center who either cannot read or comprehend my question!

Been here many times before.  But last nite, I felt like having some Korean BBQ so I took my daughter and we went to eat.  I ordered four entree meats -- marinated chicken thighs, bulgogi, beef deckle meat, and sliced pork belly.  Each serving was adequate -- not a lot, but not too little also.  I guess the only complaint I would have about the meats is that the chicken thigh was deboned and cut into very small pieces....I would rather have the chicken meat just deboned but left as big as possible.  They gave us about 8 different banchans -- nothing exciting or great, but very adequate.  I thought the kim chee was good, as was the fish cake banchan.  The other stuff was pretty good too but my daughter said she would have liked their apple banchan, but I thought they gave us enough -- even offered us refills.  We also got a plateful of lettuce leaves for wrapping the meat in, and a nice serving of green onion/lettuce salad with the spicy vinaigrette dressing -- I love that.    I ordered a bottle of shoju and my daughter had lemonade.  We thought that the service was very good and the food good too.  You might be thinking, why so much food for just two people?  Well, I gotta feed my three little dogs too, and they were waiting for their share of the dinner when we got home.  They ate all the leftover meat and chicken and some of the non-spicy banchan.  They too were satisfied and thought the food was good too.  I will be back again when the Korean BBQ cravings hit me again.

I always shop the specials and ads.  Their beef quality is USDA Select (I think), but if you are going to make stews or pot roast or something like braising the meat, then the prices are good and USDA Select is acceptable.  But I thought I would mention the Food Court.  Some good stuff their.  My favorite other Mexican Food Court place went under and lost their lease so now I go to the AZ Ave Food City.  We especially like their fired grilled chicken w/spice rub, and their Carnitas.  We take these two items out a lot and take them home to eat with our daughter and dogs.  But we sometimes eat-in too.  Last week my wife and I ate lunch there and she had two big carnitas tacos and I had the combo plate of stewed chili beef (I have forgotten the Mexican name for this dish).  I did not want the refried beans so I substituted ranch style beans and I also got a big spoonful of grilled round onions -- a pretty good and big combo lunch.  We also got a whole fired grilled chicken that we ate some and took the rest home.  Service was good and the people there were very helpful to non-Spanish speaking people like us.  Their condiment bar is very good and stocked with a lot of stuff --- all you want --- shredded cabbage, shredded lettuce, three kinds of salsa, onions, limes, peppers, and pickled vegetables.  Very good -- If you like more authentic Mexican food, this place is good.  Much better than places like Macayo's and Garcia's.

I made a previous post regarding the Food City food court.  But I think this update might be helpful to other yelpers.  This week, Food City is having a special on their "any meat" combination plate meals.  This means any prepared meat entree like carnitas, birria, machaca, etc. etc. is included on the combo plate which includes rice, beans, a small salad, and warm tortillas.  And included in this special is a two liter bottle of Pepsi!!  They also have a small but nice condiment bar which includes cilantro, onions, jalapenos, limes, three kinds of salsa, lettuce, etc. etc.  And the best part is the price for all this is $4.99 for this week's special.  And the food is pretty darn good too.  So for the price and for the generous servings, this is a good deal!

Don't mean to bore you folks, but I gotta tell you this.  Yesterday I went to buy some chicken and pork chops that were on-sale and just couldn't resist getting some menudo for an early lunch.  They serve menudo only on the weekends.  I got the "big bowl" for only $6.50!!  And it was a huge, freaking bowl.  And it was the best menudo I have ever had.  I must admit that I love menudo and have had it at about 5 other places here in AZ, but this was the best I have ever had.

Price is right, but food quality is blahhhhhh.  I succumbed to the TV advertising and went to try again.  I was disappointed.  I got a large 3 topping hand tossed pizza.  Crust was crappy, sauce was crappy, and toppings were OK but sparse.  I would rather pay a higher price and get a better pizza.  I also got  16 piece box of boneless chicken too.  That was pretty horrible -- just dry pieces of breast meat breaded and fried.  Very dry and even though the breading was seasoned, it still was crummy tasting.  I think it would have been better with batter instead of breading.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.  These days, all pizza is not worth the money.  For approximately the same price, you can get a full meal at other restaurants.  The only saving grace to pizza is that it is finger and convenience food. But that is about it.

So I dropped in for a quick lunch and a soda the other day with a friend of mine.  We just wanted something small.  So I ordered two chicken sandwiches and two cokes.  The girl said something that was not understandable and I said, " What?  Say again?"  -- she said something garbled again.  I really hate those establishments that hire people who cannot speak English.  I finally figured out she was saying "do you want fries with that?".  So I said fries with only one of them.  So she rang me up and pointed to the cash register readout that said $8.68.  So I paid.  When they called my number, I got one sandwich, one small fries, and two small drinks.  I said that I ordered two sandwiches which the girl could not understand again.  So she had to call the Manager over and he told me that my order was for only one sandwich.  So I said, "$8.68 for one small sandwich (not even a premium sandwich), small fries, and small coke?".  So to get the other sandwich they charged me $4.90.  WTF??? Almost $14 for our snack/lunch?  Not only another example where you are better off going for a real lunch at places where you can get a lunch special for $5.99 or $6.99, and get good table service, and they have employees who can speak and comprehend the English language.  And even for fast food restaurants, JIB is better, cheaper, and higher in quality.  I normally do not frequent MacDonalds because I always thought they sucked.  But this place was convenient to my cause the other day, but I will now never go back again.

Are these places Corporate owned or franchises?  I wonder?  Went for an early dinner with my wife last friday.  When we got there, we opened the door and waited at the hostess station for around five minutes before anyone came to greet us.  At the end of the bar, four wait staff were standing around and talking and not caring that they had customers waiting.  Then we were seated and waited a few more minutes before a male waiter came to take our drink order.  My wife ordered iced tea with no lemon and I ordered a beer on tap.  Her iced tea came rather quickly but it had a lemon wedge in it.  My beer did not come with her drink so I waited and waited.  About seven minutes later the waiter said that he could not find the bartender so he could not get me a beer --- WTF?  What kind of stupid place is this?  So after about 10 minutes we got our iced tea without lemon and my beer.    We ordered the two for $20 dinners they were pretty good.  Not outstanding, but pretty good.  We ordered the onion rings for our appetizer and they came hot, crispy, and perfectly fried -- I liked those.  My wife ordered the riblets with french fries and those were good too.  I ordered the four cheese penne with chicken and that came as a big serving and was pretty good too.  So I think the food is decent, not great, but decent, and the male waiter was a good server.  But the overall customer service focus and the way management runs that establishment needs to pay attention.  My guess is that this place is losing money and it is no wonder why this is happening.  I could be wrong, but these are my opinions and observations.

This review is actually for Godiva corporate -- they really piss me off!  Godiva buys mailing lists from other sources.  That is how they get your email address.  Then they spam you like heck, sending at least 6-8 spam messages a day!  On top of all of this, there is no way to "unsubscribe".  Their unsubscribe feature does not work, although it will tell you that you are now unsubscribed.  And their internet people use spamming tactics when building their spamming programs.  They use different URL schemes for each message so there is no way for you to identify the message source as Spam or Junk.  I have even written a letter to their corporate office telling them to stop this disgusting practice and have received no action at all.    Godiva sucks!  They epitomized the ugly American corporation!!

I assume Project Cure does good work and helps many needy people/countries.  But I gotta tell you that I am very disappointed in them.  I have tried calling them and emailing them on over five occasions now and nobody will answer my calls or emails.  I have thousands of dollars of new/unopened consumable medical supplies, and thousands of dollars of medical equipment and medicines and vitamins still with the safety seals intact.  I wanted to donate them to them, but I guess they are not interested.  I contacted St. Vincent de Paul's medical services clinic and they responded immediately saying that they wanted everything I have.

Was just there this past Monday, and here's the scoop -- you have to be realistic about these kind of places.  Food is mediocre at best, but there is a lot of it and its cheap.  I definitely have had worse, but for the price (under $7 for a senior citizen including the drink), you cannot go wrong.  Some positives -- they have a basic Mongolian stir-fry BBQ, but on it, there is fresh shrimp that you can make your own stir-fry combination with.  You cannot compare this place to buffets like Zen Buffet or Pacific Seafood Buffet, but for the price, you cannot go wrong.

OK; I just had to add my two cents here, after reading some of the review of other recent posters. I would agree wholeheartedly with some of the other posters, but some others must be dufesses or something.   First let me begin by saying that I have been a Cal client for about 30 years. I have literally stayed there for over 100 times. Sure they are a small hotel and casino, and sure they are not the nicest place I have ever stayed. And the rooms are not the swankiest nor the nicest, but let me tell you what is good about the Cal:   1. First, they are economical, both in terms of room cost and food and beverage (F&B) costs.  2. They are one of the friendliest and most customer service oriented hotels and casinos you will find.  3. If is one of the safest places to stay and play. This is because the clientele is mostly from Hawaii and most of the clientele have grown up with the belief that honesty and humanity is the best policy (no kidding -- not like other groups that may believe in screwing the next guy before he/she screws you). This is the only casino where you can leave your machine and go to the bathroom and ask the next person to watch your purse or money or save your seat and they will. It is one of the few casinos where the management takes the risk and expense to have their security guards carry firearms -- did you not notice? And they know how to use them -- one of the requirements of the casino and gaming commission is that firearm security guards be certified and re-certified every six months. This is one of the reasons why you hardly ever ever see scuffles or people stealing money or purses at the Cal.  4. Their player's club (B-Connected Program) is perhaps not the most generous kickback program in Vegas, but overlaying that is their generous "comp" system. You can get discount room rates, or free rooms, or free "comps" for meals quite easily which is overlaid over the B-Connected program so if you compute your B-Connected kickbacks as well as your free comps, you will find that your "rewards" far exceed what other hotels and casinos will give you --- try it, compute it -- you will find that I am 100% correct.  5. For us expat Hawaiians (or other) Hawaiian island clientele, they have the most Hawaiian style food anyway in Las Vegas. And that is very good if you are a Hawaiian or Hawaiian at heart.  6. They have a relatively simple and small steakhouse called the Redwood Bar and Grill and they have one of best prime rib dinners in Las Vegas. This is not an exaggeration -- their prime rib is outstanding in quality and in preparation.  7. They have a sister property called Main Street Station that is connected via a covered walkway. Here there is a buffet that is pretty good; especially the weekend Champagne Brunch. And also on some nights, there have a specialty menu that is outstanding like one night is T-Bone steak nite (all you can eat (AYCE)); another nite is AYCE prime rib; and on Friday's is AYCE seafood. They also have another restaurant named Triple Seven Bar and Grill, which is themed as a sports bar. But there is also a sushi bar there that has some limited, but good sushi at fair prices. They also have some outstanding bar and grill menu items -- their handmade pizzas are outstanding; their baby back rack of ribs is good; and they have super-duper burgers with fries, or onion rings, or cole slaw.   So my final comment to some of the other posters is that yes, the Cal is not the Bellagio, nor is it Caesar's Palace, but if you know what you are getting into when you book yourself into the Cal, you will find that it is a pretty outstanding place and place to spend your money.

Just an update for other Yelpers. We were there again this past weekend, and I wanted to provide some updated information. In my last post, I mentioned how safe the Cal is and again a couple of other things justify my opinions and observations. Twice this past weekend, I went looking for my wife to check on her since she is a cancer patient and not doing as well I had hoped. But both times I could not find her but I slowly walked the aisles between the rows of video poker machines where she normally plays. I was looking between the machines and saw her purse and her cigarette case both times. I looked at the credit meter on the machines and she had active credits and money in the machines, but the seat was empty. I asked the women sitting in the adjacent seats where she was and they told me that she went to the bathroom and they were watching her machine and her money for her. This was twice that I again personally saw/experienced this.   And one other thing.....my wife said that late on Friday nite (or rather Saturday morning) at 3:00 am, she was playing near one of the entrances/exits from the casino and she was by herself playing since it was very late. One of the security guards, who as I said was armed, stopped by her machine and leaned up against the wall and just waited and watched her as she continued to play for about 45 minutes. She told me that without asking her, or she asking him, my wife knew he was providing security for her since she was by herself, is pretty weak in her condition, and she was very near the exit/entrance. Now again I say, do I need to say anything more about the security at the Cal? They are the best casino that I have ever experienced over 40 years in providing guest security and customer service.   And the food again was outstanding. Well, to be truthful something things are good and some things are not-so-good. This is to be expected, but I will comment on the good. Their Friday nite special which is Chinese pork ribs (char siu ribs) is excellent. We always order two dinner portions and split one and take one home for later. In my wife's condition, she does not eat much anyway. And I fill up on the salad and condiment bar since their stuff their is pretty good too. On Sat, I had my special treat for dinner since the chef knew it was our anniversary and he personally asked me last month what I wanted him to make as our anniversary meal. I told him Osso Bucco since that is my favorite meal --- ever! He said you got it and we had that for dinner on Saturday night. Osso Bucco is not on their menu and they never make it since it is costly to make and too labor intensive, but as a favor to us, he did it. I brought a very, very special bottle of Italian Super Tuscan wine with me for our meal and it too was very, very good. I also brought a bottle of Kettle One Vodka for the chef since I knew he drank that.   Last comment -- on Sunday nite, we took a couple of friends of my wife to dinner at the Triple-7 brew pub. Again, we ordered the old standby menu choices and shared among us. We ordered a full rack of ribs with bbq sauce, we ordered an order of fish and chips, and we ordered a platter of selected (by us) nigiri sushi choices. We also order ahi poke (raw tuna marinated in a special sauce with sliced cucumbers, sliced red onions, and a good amount of high quality seaweed) and a larger order of Japan Hamachi sashimi. You might be thinking, "what a screwy combination of items to eat for dinner!", but as an expat Hawaiian, we enjoy the cosmopolitan menus offering a combination of all kinds of foods. Everything again was very good. Again, since we have been to this establishment a zillion times over the years, we know the menu by heart and know what is good. So these are some of the good things, but some things are admittedly not-so-good. Next trip I will make it a point to go drink some of their in-house brewed beers and have that with their own brick oven pizzas which are also excellent.

Sorry if I am boring you with these updates.  But some friends asked for an update since I was again there for the New Year's festivities.    So wifey and I also go for the New Year's Eve banquet and festivities.  Lots of fun gabbling and gambling with friends from Hawaii and California and eating till "we could eat no more".  So as usual, we went up on late Friday morning, 12/30.  Got there and our room was ready and all the room extras were there too --- coffee, water, coke, fridge, freezer, and extra towels, blankets, and pillows.  So since everything was A-OK with the room we went downstairs to gamble.  Had fun and played for about four hours then we met some friends for dinner in the Redwood Bar and Grill.  Had my double MacCallan 18 scotch as my cocktail and ordered dinner -- I had crab cakes, Caesar salad, baked potato (loaded), steamed veggies, and rack of lamb (medium rare).  Everything was very good as usual. Had a glass of cabernet too.  Wifey had clam chowder, king crab legs, baked potato, and piece of tri-sauced cheese cake.  She said everything was good too.  Then we went back to the casino floor to gamble.  I went to bed around 12:30 am.  At 5:00 am, I woke up to pee and noticed that my wife was still not back in the room.  So I called her on the cell phone and she did not answer.  So I put on my clothes and went downstairs to look for her.  I found her playing video poker in one of the video poker aisles and as I approached, I noticed one of the old time security guards standing at the end of the aisle leaning against the wall.  He saw me and I saw him and he gave me the nod that said that everything was OK.  I know without even asking that he was providing personal security for my wife since he knows us, and knows that my wife is a struggling cancer patient.  I have always said that the Cal's security is the best in Las Vegas!!  So I asked my wife if she was going to go to bed soon and she said let's go eat breakfast first.  So we went to eat breakfast -- she had saimin for her breakfast and I had eggs with Portuguese sausage and toast.  After breakfast she wanted to redeem the gift certificate that the casino gave us as our holiday gift ($300).  So we went to the gift shop and I had to wait about an hour while she calculated every penny and used every cent of the gift certificate.  Then she told me to take all the gifts and trinkets to the room and when I asked her what she was going to do, she said she was going back to play some more.  I think she finally went to take a nap at around 2 pm.  Since I did not shower that morning, I had to go to the room to shower, shave, and change clothes for the New Year's banquet.  I went up to the room at around 5 pm and met my wife standing in line with her friend for dinner at around 6 pm.  As usual the banquet was very good -- just to mention some of the food items -- prime rib, New York cut steaks, colossal shrimps, oysters (raw and Rockefeller), king crab legs, sashimi, sushi, salmon, sea bass, chicken a million ways, lamb chops, pork chops, roast pork loin, etc. etc. etc.  -- You get the picture; a major pig-out.  I ate my fill as did my wife and she had dessert too.  The only thing I would complain about is that we did not win any cash or the free, first class trip for two to Honolulu during the lucky number drawings.  Boy was I stuffed -- it took all my energy to stay up to midnight to wish everyone A Happy New Years.  The I went to bed.  Next morning, my wife slept in since she came to bed at 4 am.  I went to eat breakfast by myself at about 9 am......I had a bacon/green onion omelet with a side order of spam and dry rye toast.  I think my wife order room service later, but I am not sure.  We met for dinner at 7:30 pm in the Pasta Pirate Italian restaurant.  Again I had my double MacCallan 18 cocktail and my appetizer of deep fried calamari.  For my entree I had grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side of pasta.  My wife had a salad and lobster thermidor.  Then we went to play a little.  Now after three days I was only losing a little; maybe about $1500 since the gambling was very "up and down".  Win some, lose some, win some, lose some.  After playing for a couple of hours at the crap table, I was $300 ahead at craps --- again an up and down table.....cannot win, but at least did not lose too.  So I took the $300 and decided to invest it in the video poker machines.  After playing for an hour or so and losing $250 of the $300, I was playing this one machine and it dealt me the K,Q,J,10 of clubs -- I pushed the draw button and lo and behold the A of clubs came in.  So I won $2000 on this fifty cents machine.  So I quit.  I went to tell my wife that I was going to bed and that I won a sum total of $255 for the whole trip --- a pretty good deal if you ask me, since I alone probably ate and drank at least $800 worth of food and booze.  So we went home happy.  And my wife enjoyed herself.

Since my last post on the Cal in early Jan 2012, I see where others have posted as well.  And I am happy to see that all the posts have been positive and focused on the things that the Cal does well -- customer service, good prices, good food, and affordable table game limits.  Since my past post, have been back five times already --- yup, that's about every two weeks or so.    Going back next week again for a big slot tournament.  Never won one, even second or third place.  Maybe this time will be a charm.  I could use some gambling money instead of always depositing there.  But my losing is not the Cal's fault.  It is just my damn crappy luck.    Last weekend again, we ate well.  I had the large cut prime rib in the steak house with a loaded baked potato and some Caesar salad....very good and ono.  I had oxtail twice -- one was soup and one was stew.  I had hamburger steak, rice, mac salad, and gravy at the snack bar -- that was very good too.  I had the Sunday brunch at Main Street Station before the bus took us to the Nascar races on Sunday.  That was pretty good too.  And lastly, I had the Pasta Pirate's special spag with meatballs and a crab cake appetizer too.  I try to eat and drink enough to get my money back, but now that I am older, I can't eat and drink that much anymore (just joking).  So once again, if you don't mind a simple hotel and casino, without any entertainment or music, but want good service, good prices, and good food, try the California Hotel and Casino.  You will not be disappointed!

OK; you folks that follow my reviews must be getting sick of my comments regarding "The Cal".  But I thought an update would be appropriate again.    Just a short update -- we just came back from a 3 day weekend.  As usual the service was friendly and excellent.  And again my crazy wife who is sick, stayed up all night playing video poker, and I had to go downstairs early at 6 am to look for her when I got up and discovered that she did not come up to the room.  Again when I went down, I found her playing by herself on a machine in a corner, and one of the security guards was standing off on the side, leaning up against the wall and I knew he was providing her with personal security due to her frailties.  When I saw him and he saw me, he nodded with that look that said everything is OK here.  Some comments about some of our food -- Friday night we ate a simple dinner at the snack bar.  I had the hamburger steak and macaroni salad.  I have had this entree before but this time the burger was freaking huge; maybe about 3/4 pound.   And it was very, very tasty.  My wife ate a "bento" and it was good too.  One day we had oxtail stew in the cafe.  Again I have had this dish many times before but this time, the taste was better.  I cannot put my finger on it, but it was even more tasty.  And the oxtails were cooked perfectly!  Just some prodding with my fork made the meat  "fall of the bones".    And on Sunday night, we ate at the Redwood steakhouse again.  My wife's appetizer called "seafood medley", was excellent.  They take an escargot dish with the five depressions in it and fill each depression with an oyster, a shrimp, a scallop, lump crab meat, and a piece of lobster.  Then they put some cream sauce over everything and put cheese on the top and bake it until it is golden brown.  They serve it with garlic toast and my wife says it is excellent  -- it would make a good entree, but probably too rich as an entree and people couldn't eat that much of it.  I ordered (again) the "Redwood Cut" of prime rib.  This time the cut was noticeably smaller....I asked our server and she said yes, it is now 28 ounces instead of 32.  When I asked her why they did this, she said she did not know.  My theory is that 32 ounces was too big anyway for most people, so 28 ounces is still pretty big.  As usual, I ate 1/3 and took the other 2/3 home for my "girls (three dogs)".  Just out of anal curiosity, I looked at the menu again and they even lowered the price of the prime rib -- I guess to match the reduction in size.  The price used to be $38 but now it is down to $30.  And yes, it is real prime rib, slow roasted and cooked to perfection.  After drinking my two double MacCallan 18's, eating my Caesar Salad, my  "loaded" baked potato, and steamed asparagus, I was full.  But my wife ordered a dessert which she normally takes two bites of and is done.  But this time she ordered some kind of apple crisp dessert --- looked like a piece of dutch apple pie with whipped cream on top.  She said it was excellent and ate it all.  Well, it must have been excellent for her to eat it all.  Oh yeah, if anyone is interested, my wife again order her king crab legs and ate maybe 1/3 too.  But nothing will go to waste.  We wrap everything up and take it to the room and either refrigerate it or freeze it and take it home.  Either we eat it or our girls will eat it all, so nothing goes to waste.

OK; I have written multiple reviews about this place before.  So I will not bore you with my repeated diatribe.  But I did want to update my comments about the food scene.  I will also note that we went to attend the 2013 Las Vegas 400 NASCAR race and also witnessed the last flyover by the Air Force's Thunderbirds.  My son and I ate at the Redwood Bar and grill again.  As usual, our favorite gal waited on us and gave us superior service (as usual).  I had a Caesar salad, the Redwood cut of prime rib, and a loaded baked potato.  This meal comes with our special bread and steamed veggies.  My son calls this cut of meat the Fred Flintstone cut -- it is now 28 ounces, used to be 32 ounces a couple of years ago, and was even larger at 36 ounces even before that.  The best part is that the meat is indeed Prime beef in grade and expertly roasted.  I love it and can eat only about 1/3 and I always take the other 2/3 home to my three girls (little dogs).  My son ordered a 16 ounce cowboy, bone-in rib steak (super rare) and added two lobster tails too.  He also ordered some oysters on the half shell, a mixed salad, and a loaded baked potato.  He only ate maybe 1/3 of his steak, and took the rest home for his dogs too, but he ate the rest of what he ordered.  And again, I think our liquor bill was higher than our food bill -- so you can imagine how much he drinks.  We also ate oxtail soup for breakfast on the day we left.  As usual, it was good.  My home made version is better, but WTH, it was pretty good anyway and large in portion so we liked it.

I am posting an update again.  Must be boring to you yelpers.  I also noticed that the last update I posted was in 2013 NASCAR.  I attended this event with my son, but I did not mention the loss of my wife.  I don't know why I did not mention this -- I lost my wife in Aug 2012 after a long struggle with cancer.  In previous posts about the Cal, I did mention that she was a struggling cancer patient.  Well, anyway, I still go to the Cal a lot, but now mainly by myself.  But this past weekend, I went again to the Cal with some friends and family to celebrate multiple August birthdays of family members, and to commemorate the passing of my late wife.  Again the Cal graciously accommodated us and comped our rooms and meals.  They even arranged for a big family dinner in the Redwood Bar and Grill Steakhouse.  We all had a good time and enjoyed ourselves.    I am, as are the other members of my family, big fans of the Cal  - the casino with the best customer service, best customer security, and the best rewards for its players!!

OK; I am a regular visitor to Las Vegas, but I cannot remember ever writing a review for the Second Street Grill in the Fremont Hotel.  My late wife and my family and I have eaten here many times over the years.  We made reservations for 7:30 pm and that was good since it was packed with people waiting and people without reservations wanting to add their names to the waiting list.  I heard the hostess tell them that their wait would be 2+ hours or more.  We also requested and got assigned my favorite waitress there -- I will not add her name to this posting since I don't know if she would approve of me doing that.  But part of my good dining experiences in all the Vegas restaurants that  I frequent, is due to the special servers that I always request.  Without good, knowledgeable, and courteous service, your dining experience could be the pits!    Anyway, I had a small salad and the assorted tempura platter -- I thought this was excellent (as usual).  It contained about 4 large pieces of vegetable tempura, three large/jumbo shrimp tempura, one whole soft shell crab tempura, and big piece of fish tempura, and some other things that I have now forgotten.  I ate my full and couldn't finish, but my piggie son finished it for me.  And even after eating his dinner that he ordered!!  He ordered the combo escargot/scallop appetizer -- three escargots and three giant scallops in garlic butter with garlic bread.  A large salad with cukes and tomatoes, and then his Mongolian rack of lamb with garlic mashed potatoes. He ate it all and mine too.  Oh yeah, as usual, our liquor bill was about equivalent in $$ to our food bill.  But that is normal for us.  The food here is pretty good -- not outstanding, but pretty darn good.  And they give us regulars very good service.  I would also say that the prices are high, but not unusually high for a semi-fine dining place.  I would say that they are no higher in price that other fine dining establishment.  I will always go back again, maybe even this coming weekend since my daughter this time wants to go to Vegas with me.

OK; I am updating my reviews because I am seeing unfavorable reviews lately for this restaurant.  My daughter and I were there on 10/26 for dinner.  As always, we had a good dinner with good service.  They put back the whole, deep-fried fish on the menu and I ordered that cause I love it.  I couldn't figure out what kind of fish it was, but it was fine.  My D ordered crab legs and she said it was fine too.  Gloria was our server, as I always ask for her.  She has done a great job for me over the decades and decades that I have been going here and she was great to us again.  So I guess I do not understand the negative reviews of others recently.

Was there again for probably the 90th time this past week.  Things have not changed much at all.  This place is dinky and a hole-in-the-wall.  If you are looking for really authentic Chinese food, then this is probably not the place to go to.  However, if you are looking for "Hawaiian Style Cantonese Food" then this place is a must.  Cheap prices and great cantonese food cooked with a Hawaiian style flair (hard to describe, but those from Hawaii would know what I mean).  Last week, we had Chinese style dry chow fun (lots of bean sprouts with slivers of char siu), Hawaiian style Kau Yuk (pot roast pork), pork with harm ha and ong choi (really ono; my favovite), deep friend Gau Gee (only in Hawaii -- gigantic sized wun tuns), stuffed bitter melon, minced pork with egg plant, oyster sauce chicken, stuffed duck with barley, and Chinese brocolli with beef and cake noodle (cake noodles are only found in Hawaii -- some chef made these with overcook chow mein boiled noodles years ago and fried the mess into a flat cake---really, really great!).

OK; went there for lunch again on 7/23.  We were not disappointed -- we had crispy gau gee, oyster sauce chicken over cake noodle, kau yuk, port harm har ong choi, stuffed duck, and honey walnut shrimps.  All very good and the same old fashion "Hawaiian Style Cantonese" taste.  I heard a little secret that this place might open a second location in a very, very special place that will make a lot of people super happy and the owner a lot of money.  But I don't want to let the cat out of the bag or speak too soon, so I will leave what I said at that.

Went for a big lunch again with my son and his family on Sunday, 10/7.  We all love this place -- "Hawaiian Style Cantonese Food"  -- and as you can probably guess, we are all ex-pat Hawaiians.  Let me begin with a funny comment  - a guy and his wife were there already at 11 am and ordered the standard, plate lunch special off the menu.  They had their cup of soup and some entree with an egg roll and fried rice on the plate lunch.  So when our food came (I will get to what we ordered later) he says to the waitress, "what was that they ordered?  It looks so good!".  To me, the funny thing is why did you come to this restaurant and order the crappy plate lunch off the menu?  No wonder why our food looks (and tastes) so good and your lunch looks and tastes like crap.  So my son did the ordering.  He ordered a double order of crispy fried gau gees, stuffed duck, harm har ong choi with pork, kau yuk, beef broccoli cake noodle, spicy fried pork chops, fish cake with vegetables, and oyster sauce chicken.  He actually wanted to order a few more things, but we told him that we had more than enough food already for three adults and two kids.    Of course he wanted to order more --- not only because he wanted to eat those dishes that he misses, but that grandpa was paying and he wanted to take the leftovers back to California (they drove back right after lunch).  So everything we ordered was very good and tasty.  Not a surprise to us since we have ordered these dishes many times before and they have all been consistently good.  Now this place does have a few dishes which are pretty lousy -- I will not mention them but this baffles me since the cook is a typical and experienced Hawaiian Style Chinese chef.  But some things are not very good and that makes no sense to me.  So as long as you order the "good stuff", you will not be disappointed and the prices are great.    If you are of Chinese extraction and like good, authentic Cantonese food, you might not like this place.  The reason for this is that the Cantonese food has been modified a bit to reflect the "old style" Hawaiian style Cantonese cooking, that is traditional in Hawaii.  Some of my Cantonese friends do not like this food because of the modifications, but to us ex-pat Hawaiians, the place is the "bomb".

My son and I were in Vegas again so we decided to eat lunch at Wo Fat again.  We ordered four dishes since there were only two of us but we could not finish all that we ordered -- maybe we should not have eaten some of that rice too.  We ordered deep fried kau gees, oyster sauce cake noodle, stuffed duck, and beef bitter melon.  Here are the photos of what we ate.

Was here for lunch again on 8/24/14.  Still very good.  Did the ownership change?  Maybe a new cook?  The food tasted a little different (but still good), and the presentation style of the dishes were also different.  But I still think that for "Hawaiian Style" Cantonese food, this place is very good.  And the prices have gone up a bit, but still very good.  For those of you who are interested this is what we ordered: 4 orders of crispy gau gee, one order of beef brocolli/cake noodle. one order beef gailan/cake noodle, fishcake with veggies, spicy eggplant with pork, kau yuk, pot roast chicken, harm har ong choi, and one other dish that escape my memory right now.  The purpose of listing all the dishes is to let you know that all these dishes were very good.  We ordered extra since my son drove home immediately to LA and took the leftovers with him.

OK, bear with me and this long review. I am a Las Vegas and gambling freak, so this kind of topic and review is in my comfort zone -- so hear goes.   I rate the Sun Coast as four stars, only because they are just not up the super high standards of a mega casino on the Vegas Strip or Atlantic City. Sun Coast is now one of the Boyd Gaming properties having been acquired rather recently. Wifey and I have been Boyd Gaming regulars for about 30+ years now, being considered VIP regulars by Boyd Gaming and the downtown Vegas properties where we normally stay.   This was our first trip to the Sun Coast, having been invited by one of the shift bosses for over a year, who has been a friend of ours for many, many years (he used to be downtown but was transferred all over the place). So we took him up on his offer and made the trip this past three day weekend.   Our suite was very nice -- maybe not as nice a suite in a mega casino, but a pretty nice and comfortable suite for an off-strip property. I mean pretty damn nice.   They have a nice casino with literally hundreds and hundreds of machines. However, they only have three craps tables and only one is going with some players. Since I am a craps player, I found this a little disappointing since I did not have the option of moving from table to table trying to play where the "hot" action is. I really believe that this issue is part of the cause for me to have lost a bundle at craps this weekend. But my wife did OK on the machines -- of course up and down, but mostly up. Then on the last night she lost all her winnings, but never went negative the whole trip. From my point of view, that is OK.   They have a lot of dining options from simple push cart stuff like hot dogs, pop corn, snacks, sandwiches, etc. up to Northern Italian, Steaks and Seafood and stuff like that. We ate at the buffet a couple of times and that was OK -- nothing spectacular, but not bad. We ate at the Oyster Bar for seafood and that was very good -- good food, good prices, and good draft beer -- and let me say again, pretty good prices. We also ate at the SC Prime Steakhouse and had super-premium scotches, oysters, rib steaks, and lamb chops, sides, salads, etc. Again pretty good food and good prices. Let me clarify again and say that the food is very good (not outstanding) and the prices are very good (not cheap, but not atrociously high).   Also, for those visitors that are not on full-comp with the casino, it is very, very easy to "earn"  free meals at the buffet and the cafe.  It really does not take much play to earn meals from breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Using machine play as an example, the system works on a dollar in basis (dollars played, NOT WON OR LOST).  You can earn free breakfast for only $300 in.  With $600 in, you earn dinner.  If you play $900 total in, you earn breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Maybe for non-players this might seem like a lot, but it is not really.  For example, playing at the quarters level, $900 coin-in is only about 3 hours of play per day, for a slow (speed of play) player.  And lastly, the people and staff though out the property were nice, courteous, and very friendly. This is a reflection of the upper management of the property that must demand this kind of customer service from its employees.

Went yesterday with my wife and daughter for a big lunch.  When we go for a big lunch, we normally order a lot and pig-out so that we don't have to make dinner that night.  Been a fan of Tao Garden for a long, long time --- maybe 10+ years.  Go to sit down and eat, and we get take-out a lot.  Generally speaking, we are not disappointed.  We know what is good on their menu and what is not-so-good.  So we stick to what we like.  Yesterday was no exception, we ordered a lot and everything was good.  The service was good and we talked with the husband/wife owners again.  They are also nice and their lead waitress is an old-timer who is friendly and knowledgeable.  She speaks English well, but know Chinese and all the Chinese dishes well.  We order two noodles (my wife and daughter like noodles).  We had gong lo mein with extra beansprouts and chicken and gailan (Chinese Brocolli-Hong Kong style).  We also had steamed chicken with spicy oil and chili dipping sauce, deep friend stuffed tofu, Chinese beef stew with beef tendons.  All very, very good.  Perhaps not the very best Cantonese food we have had, but still very good, especially for the Phoenix area where the restaurants have to cater to the clientele's tastes and likes.  I really don't understand why other people don't go here more often.  Maybe the Chinese buffets, even with pretty crappy food, still draw the crowds due to the cheap prices.

I drove yesterday to a particular Chinese restaurant to have lunch since I was super hungry due to fasting for over 24 hours.  When I got there, I discovered I forgot my wallet and had to drive back to my office to get it.  Now I was really hungry so I went to Tao Garden which is half a mile down the street from me.  Since I was super hungry, I actually ordered two lunches.  One was a big order of char siu chow funn (dry) with extra bean sprouts.  The other lunch was one of their lunch specials - beef bitter melon over rice (rice plate).  Both were excellent.  I think they had the sliced bitter melon soaking in a baking soda solution, since it was very bright green even after cooking and the portion of beef was pretty good too.  Both dishes were consumed in total by me -- albeit it was a little struggle, but I did finish both of my lunches.    Still pretty good Cantonese food for the price.

Actually, I would give them 3.5 stars -- went for lunch last week with my wife. She had the gyros lunch special with a side of Greek salad. I had the roasted lamb dinner with a side of Greek salad. Both meals were very good. My lamb dinner was flavorful and with the three sides and with the addition of the small Greek salad, there was plenty of food to fill me up. My wife's lunch came to about $8 and my dinner came to $20. But with a $10 off coupon that they advertise, we had a great meal for $18! Oh yeah, my wife had a coke for an additional $2.00 (I think) and I had a glass of so-called Greek Cabernet Sauvignon. The glass of wine cost me an additional $10 and it was pretty putrid. Maybe this statement is an over reaction on my part, but being the wine snob that I am, I really thought that it was bad. Worth maybe $4.50 a glass at best. But a decent place for a Greek meal if you ask me.

I like Ikea's products -- fairly decent for the price, but their customer service really stinks.  It is difficult if not totally impossible to speak to anyone at the local store or at their regional offices via telephone.  Their auto attendant function is probably purposely designed to put you into an endless loop!!  And when you go to the store, they give you wrong information.  I was told you can look up product availability online, but you can't!!  How frustrating.

OK; just an update regarding the food.  My son and I went and sat at the sushi bar on Sunday at about 8:30 PM.  It was still busy and packed, but we got good service as usual.  We ordered hamachi kama (and got a super large piece with the whole collar and a lot of filet attached to it), a mixed sashimi plate of ahi, hamachi, ika, and tako.  Very big serving for the price.  And some various nigiri sushis.    Again the food was excellent and we were satisfied.

Went for dinner on a Saturday night and it was packed - the bar, patio, and the dining area.  I guess this is a popular spot on Saturdays.  My 4 star rating is a composite rating for all things considered -- food, prices, service, atmosphere, location, etc. etc. etc.    First the good.  I thought the food and drink were pretty darn good.  And the prices were fair and the portions large.  We even had a bottle of $36 cab, and it was decent, not some rot gut stuff.  Service was fast and efficient.  We shared 2 apps -- bruschetta and an antipasto platter.  They were both good.  The antipasto platter had salami, prosciutto, spicy Swiss cheese, mozzarella, and white cheddar chunks, olives, artichoke hearts, and roasted red bell peppers.  My GF had lemon chicken with asparagus; her daughter had chicken fettuccine alfredo; and I had double lamb shanks with risotto -- not as good as osso bucco but pretty darn good anyway.  We all thought the food was good.  Atmosphere was nice and good, but a little cramped in the dining room.  Service was efficient, but maybe a little rushed.  Maybe not someplace to go if you are looking to have a leisurely romantic dinner.    The prices were fair, especially when considering the large portion sizes.  We will be back.

Went for dinner last nite with my GF and Daughter.  It was pretty empty -- maybe because of the holiday?  We ordered appetizers, salads, soup, and entrees, along with a bottle of wine.  All pretty good, especially my Italian Sausage and Peppers over Rigatoni.  The sausage was removed from the casing and it and the peppers were cooked in some kind of white cream sauce -- very delicious.  It was the best sausage and peppers I have ever had and I have eaten a lot of them in many, many different Italian restaurants.  And the pasta was truly al dente, which is a must for me.

I've been here a couple of times before and I was always satisfied.  But last night I was a little disappointed.  We ordered two apps between the 3 of us and they were good -- the antipasta platter and the fried calamari (which came with a nice, big salad).  Our entrees were the curried seafood pasta (which was good), veal Marsala, and the stuffed pork with mushrooms.  Both meat entrees were good except for the saucing -- each had a generous portion of mushrooms on the plate, but the sauces were too sweet.  The stuffed pork has a brown sauce with too much sugar in it, and my veal had probably too much Marsala wine in it -- very sweet and heavy and "winey".  I had a Groupon and another expired Groupon which is a prepaid voucher for the face value I paid for it.  They would not take both of them saying that the rules only allowed them to take one.  OK, I acquiesced, but I don't get it -- one valid groupon I understand, but the face value one is just like a prepaid voucher -- the restaurant got paid for the face value.  Probably something I don't understand here, but it was not explained very well to me either.  And another thing, our water glasses and soft drinks were never refilled.  And the bottle of wine I ordered was crazy bad -- worse than two buck chuck; but that is my fault not the restaurants -- I should have know better than to order a cheap bottle of wine.  However, I do think that the restaurant management should be more aware that their servers are serving red wine in white wine glasses, even if the wine is two buck chuck.

OK; just a short review.  Some friends of mine have encouraged me to write this review and add it to the yelp postings.  I ate here twice last year, as a guest of the management of the casino.  Both times were great.  I ate steak (obviously) both times; once the $52 bone-in rib steak and the other time the $56 lamb chops.  Very delicious, as was the sides.  This establishment is very nice and the food and booze and wines are great, but pretty expensive.  Well, not ungodly expensive, but pretty darn expensive if you ask me.  My scotch costs like $25 a shot, and my wine was like $350 for the bottle (retail price is $149).  So in conclusion, if you want a very nice place and a very good meal, you won't be disappointed by going here, but just remember that it is a pretty pricey place.

Wow!  Look at all the crappy reviews, and they still do not do anything about it.  Shame on the management and leadership/ownership!  I agree with almost all of the complaints, since I have experienced them too.  But I am now doubly disappointed in the online edition.  The previous online version was pretty crappy too, but this new version is even worse!  I suppose it is supposed to be an improvement but believe me it is not!  The new version has too much flash in it and makes it very unstable.  It is not easy to navigate and due to the excessive flash, you have to wait too long for everything to load.  And the errors!  Egad!  Is there nobody who proofreads anymore?  On any given day, you can find at least 10 spelling, date, context, or erroneous captions.    What a freaking joke for a paper -  both the print and online editions.

OMG!!  This POS newspaper keeps getting worse and worse.  They have idiots for writers and morons for editors.  In the dining section today, they have a piece on a Tempe izakaya which contains at least 6 misspellings or non-existant words.  While I realize that these are white people trying to write about Japanese foods and items, for a newspaper, they should do some research as opposed to shooting from the hip and embarrassing themselves.  All I can say is OMG!

Wife and I went for lunch there last week.  We liked it very much and have been here now a total of about five times.  While their lunch buffet might not be spectacular, they have some things that make it worthwhile from our perspective.  My wife likes their fresh fruit offerings, which were fresh, cold, sweet, and very nice.  We love their spicy mayo chicken salad, and some of their curries.  I like their Thai version of Chinese char siu (roasted sweet red pork).  Their pad thai noodles are OK, but they use a little too much vinegar for my taste and the noodles they use are thinner than what I am accustomed to.  But don't get me wrong, the pad thai is still pretty good.

My GF and I went for lunch today.  For the price, this restaurant's lunch buffet is very good.  Good variety and pretty tasty dishes.  Our favorites are the spicy cream chicken with veggies, pad Thai noodles, Thai char siu, deep fried tofu with green beans, and spicy fish fillets with veggies.  They got other dishes too that are good, but there is too much to eat all of it.  Although I did have a little serving of chicken panang curry.

I am not a candy eater, but my wife is a chocoholic freak so I go here a lot with her or for her.  I was just there this morning to pick up more candy for her since she was running out.  I just thought I would mention the fact that they are always very courteous at See's and they do something very carefully that I most other establishments don't.  When you buy some candy, they have various box sizes -- half pound, one pound, two pound, etc. etc.  When they put your box on the scale when you are paying for your candies, the scale automatically adjusts for the weight of the box, whether it be the small half pound box, or a big five pound box.  You might not think that this is a big deal, but some places don't do this or the adjustment is not very accurate.  Also, I was using a gift certificate for one pound of candy so they filled the one pound box full -- when they weighed it, the weight was not quite one pound so they gave me the two extra pieces in a small bag.  Most places just fill the box and call it even.  So I think that See's concern for customer service and giving the customer full value for their dollar is very good, especially in today's "bad customer service climate".  Incidentally, my wife says that the value to price ratio of See's candy is even higher than Godiva Chocolates, Bill Blase chocolates, etc. etc.  She should know -- consuming maybe 50 pounds of choc candy each year!!

Went for lunch yesterday with two friends.  I was a little disappointed with the food.  The pricing still has not changed much, although they advertise "new lower prices".  And of course, they still charge extra for the drink, even though their advertising coupons say "drink now included in meal purchase price".  WTF????  My opinion is the entrees are not as good as before and the available choices are no better than the other cheap Chinese buffets.  Even though the prices are higher, Pacific Seafood Buffet is better and probably worth the higher price.  However, the salad bar has some better salads on it --- Caesar salad, spinach salad, etc. etc.  And the other funny and amusing thing is they have a few Americanized dishes on the buffet that are pretty good.  They have a baked or roasted garlic/herb chicken dish that is pretty good and they have a pasta dish --- angel hair pasta with a cream and cheese sauce with shrimp in it that is pretty darn good.  So I guess if I had the Caesar salad or spinach salad, the chicken, a serving of the angel hair with shrimp pasta, and the garlic bread, I could have had a nice big, satisfying Italian lunch.  And for the price, $9.00 in total, that would not be bad.  Maybe I will do that the next time...........

My wife and I have been there twice in the last two weeks.  Four times all together but the first two times over a year or so ago.  We were disappointed the second time we went when the Owner's wife charged us full price even though that day we went,  they had some promotional discounts and pricing on the meals we ordered.  At that time, they did not have the promos and specials listed on table placards like they do now.  So we felt that we were sort of "cheated", when we discovered this after the fact.  But then we decided to go again and give them another chance.  While their food is not the greatest and their sushi is nothing special, their pricing is fair (not low, but fair) and the food quality and quantity is acceptable.  But the thing we like is that they will accomodate special orders for things that they may have in their food/goods inventory, but are not on the menu.  My wife and I normally ask for a couple of special things that we really like but are not on traditional menus.  We appreciate the fact that they will accomodate us and do not charge us an arm and a leg for these special orders.  Also, my wife and I are big eaters and also eat the "good stuff".  So for the two of us, our bill at lunch is normally like $80 and dinner is in excess of $100.  We order stuff like toro sashimi, tempura fresh oysters, and giant shrimp tempura with tempura chiso.  The reason why I mention this is that while maybe we should not expect anything, you would think that for marketing purposes, they would try to remember their "good customers" and give us something small gratis -- like a small appetizer or maybe a small dessert.

Wifey and I went for dinner again last night.  We keep coming back to this place since they are consistent with their food -- pretty good; not outstanding but pretty good and fair prices.  Their "all day happy hour" menu is very limited, but there are some things on the menu that are OK.  And their sushi menu is limited but they have the "standard" stuff and it is pretty good too.  So all-in-all, my wife and I enjoy eating at this place.  As I have said before, my wife and I are big eaters and we order and drink a lot so we like places where we get what we paid for and the quality is decent.  At sushi places, our typical bill is over $80 and that is low by our old standards where our bill for two would average over $150.  But as we get older, we cannot eat as much as before and I cannot drink as much as before.  My wife is a shrimp tempura freak and she says that this place has decent tempura.  Isn't it funny that most so-called Japanese restaurants don't know how to make good, flaky tempura?  And I like good, traditional sushi and izakaya food.  Last nite, they had a couple of things that I sometimes have difficulty finding -- they had aji (horse mackerel) and shishito (Japanese peppers) which I had them fry in tempura batter.  And the large Japanese beers were $5 each, which is not necessarily cheap, but decently priced.  The best place for large Japanese beers are at Oriental Grill in Gilbert where the first beer is $5.75 and the second beer is $0.01.  I know these things because I like to drink Japanese beers when I eat sushi.  I don't do shochu anymore; I get too drunk.

Just spoke with a customer service rep.  Probably the dumbest rep I have ever talked to, including those overseas call center reps.  Couldn't understand what I was telling her; she was making up ridiculous answers since she didn't understand my questions or couldn't answer them.  SW Gas should be ashamed to have people like that representing their company.

So my wife and I, and her brother and SIL, went for dim sum this past Saturday.  We went due to the good reviews on Yelp and also the fact that both C-Fu and China restaurant in Chandler are going downhill really fast.  I would say that the dim sum was pretty good and that is why I gave it four stars.  The pricing for most of the dim sum choices are also pretty good.  They have a wide variety of dishes and all kinds of sweets, meats, stews, etc. etc.  Another thing we like is that you can order a combo of three different dim sum treats if they are the same price since a single order is for three thingies anyway.  This makes it very easy to try some things that you might not have seen or tried before.  Again, the food is pretty darn good.    Now a couple of criticisms -- the tables need Lazy Susan's on them.  We ordered so many dishes that you just cannot reach across the table to try all the things.  The other criticism is that the meats that are cut and served at the dim sum tables is priced outrageously from how they are priced at the BBQ counter.  For instance, you can get a whole roast duck for $16.50 at the BBQ counter, but at the tables about a quarter of a duck will run you $7.00, which equates to $28.00 for a whole duck.  Same thing for the roast pork.  At the BBQ counter, a pound of roast pork will cost you $8.95, but at the table, about 6 oz. will run $7.00 which equates to about $18 per pound.  I realize that the table service should be a little more, but not that high!  And on top of all that, you cannot go buy a pound of roast pork at the BBQ counter and bring it in to the table and eat it with your other dim sum choices.

I was just there this morning.  And again about two weeks ago.  I think the food is still pretty good and they changed their stupid pricing policy about not being able to buy BBQ at the deli and then sitting down and ordering some other dishes and eating some BBQ that we just bought.  But my gripe this morning is the crappy customer service.  I hate to generalize, but many Chinese restaurants have crappy attitudes about customers and feel that they are doing the customers a favor by taking our money and patronage.  I was there at 10 am the opening time to buy some BBQ.  I waited until 10:10 before they opened the doors, although the people saw me standing there.  And when I walked in, it took them another five minutes to grumpily ask me what I wanted.  Again, hate to generalize by many Chinese and Korean restaurants are like this.  Why is that?  Must be the heritage or something.

Generally, I agree with the other reviewers -- this place is pretty good and authentic.  Some things are really good and tasty, but some other things are underseasoned (I wonder why?).  The menudo was hearty, but underseasoned.  The lengua could have been seasoned more and thrown on the grill a bit.  But the tortas and the burrito were very, very good, as were the sauces.  The condiment counter is well stocked with a variety of typical but good things to add to your order.  I will be back.

Cox has done it again!  Frequent outages and when you call them, they always claim they have no problems in my service area.  Happens at least 6-8 times a year.  Yesterday, my internet went down about 1 pm, and they again claimed that they had no problems.  But miraculously my internet connection was restored by itself at around 2 pm.  And they don't have a way of letting us know if they was a problem so that we don't go on wondering about it forever!  Crappiest telecommunications service provider I have experienced in my life -- and that is across 9 states.

My beef is actually with Wells Fargo Bank in general, and not necessarily the Chandler Branch.  My issue is that WFB has now implemented new check cashing and depositing methodologies like taking a picture with your smart phone and sending it to them for deposit.  The only problem is that with some of these new methodologies, they cannot provide their customer's with copies or images of the cancelled checks.  But they won't admit their deficiency in this area.  They make up all kinds of excuses like the check must have been damaged or lost in transit, but I know that this is total B.S. since when I look at my checking account, the checks from all the EXACTLY SAME ESTABLISHMENTS ARE THOSE WHERE CANCELLED CHECK OR THEIR IMAGES ARE NOT RETRIEVABLE!!  So I know for a fact that these establishments are using the new deposit methodologies and WFB have not figured out a way to save the images.  Why do they lie?  Do they think we are stupid?  Banks all suck!!!

Update:  I tried to transfer some money with their online services from one of my trust savings accounts and it would not allow me to do it.  I tried 3 times with the same result.  So I called customer service for help -- I hate those call centers, you always get to talk with some dufess.  She helped me and said it was fixed and it would now work.  So I tried again with the same result.  So I called again and got some guy that said the first gal did it wrong and he fixed it --- NOT!!  Same result; still not working.  So I called back for try #3  -- this time another guy tells me that it was originally set up a long time ago and couldn't understand why it was not working and implied that I was doing it wrong......Gimme a break.  I have been doing online money transfers for decades with no problem, other than this one account.  So I call again for the fourth time and get another guy who investigates and informs me that trust accounts are not allowed to make online transfers.  Finally, I got a valid (hopefully) reason!!!  But when I ask why, he doesn't know.   WTH!  Why do these banks always use poorly trained dufesses in their call centers?  And why don't they have access to experts???  I hate freaking banks!

OK; been busy for a week or so, but finally got around to trying to address my problem.  So I drive to the branch bank here and talk with one of those so-called personal bankers.  Now not to seem officious or something, but I am a platinum/preferred client.  So they give me this gal as a personal banker and I tell her my issue and the problems I have had with their customer service call center.  She tells me that she is not well versed with trust accounts and cannot help me -- again, an issue of poor training.  So she goes to get the branch manager.  Now this gal is obviously more experienced and knowledgeable and I tell her my saga again.  She says that whomever gave me those stories were wrong.  There are no restrictions on trust accounts preventing me for transferring funds from or to those kinds of accounts.    So she shows me how to do it.  While she is showing me, I notice that she goes thru a series of internet maneuvers that differ slightly from what I have always used, but she says that sometimes you have to use a work around to get around the bugaboos with their computer systems -- WTF???  How the heck am I supposed to know that???  In any event, she solves my problem but I still do not feel comfortable with the way WFB has these "issues" with their computer systems that you need to understand the "alternate methods" to get done what you want done.  But at least I got my problem solved but I still think their customer service is sorely lacking when they have the public deal with poorly trained or non-experienced reps.

Went to pick up some plate lunch dinners on Saturday evening.  Spoke with Will and saw his mother cooking.  He told me that they took over this franchise location about six years ago.  So I had not been back to this location for over six years -- how time flies!  The previous owners made crummy food, even though they are supposed to be cooking from tried and true, franchise recipes.  So after trying the old owners' food about three times we gave up on this location.  But this past weekend, my daughter wanted their garlic shrimp, so we order from them again.  I ordered three plates, but my order was misinterpreted and we got four plates instead.  I paid for all four since we wanted to try the food again and Will assured me that I would not be disappointed.  Their kalbi short ribs and bbq chicken was very good, and my daughter said that her garlic shrimp was also very good.  The macaroni salad was "Hawaiian Style" and good too.  We also had some beef teriyaki and that was mediocre at best -- the beef was too lean and tough, and the marinade was not very good.  If they soaked the beef in the kalbi sauce and made a bbq version of bulgogi, that would have been better.  Prices are on the high side; not extremely high, but high.  Plates are about $9 each and the short rib plate is like $10.  But I still give them four stars since their food is pretty good and I will be back.  Will try some other entrees the next time.

The owners, Michael and Susan Lueng, used to be the owners of Hong Kong Dining on McDowell in Phoenix.  When they sold that place and opened this place, they offered only a limited menu.  I ate here three times over a couple of years after they moved here and was not happy with the limited menu.  But yesterday, my wife and I decided to drop in for a quick lunch of some soup noodles, but I was surprised to find that they now offer a very expansive menu!  We ordered seven dishes and took the leftovers home. The food was great and so were the portions and the prices.  Just like we remembered at their old place which we used to frequent every week or so, on the way to the Suns games.  But now, we can go to the Asian Cafe Express to have great Hong Kong/Cantonese food.

OK; we went for lunch again last week.  Susan (Michael's wife) was there and since we were between the lunch and dinner crowd, the customers were only a few.  So we had a chance to chat with both of them a little.  Just like the old times on McDowell.  Ordered seven dishes again for just the two of us.  Took the leftovers home for dinner for that nite and the next night too.  For the first time we tried their pork sparerib hotpot with taro slices....very good and tasty.  We have not been disappointed with their food.  But remember, this is authentic Cantonese restaurant and if you looking for Chinese-American or Mandarin or some other kind of Chinese food, this is not the place for you.

Went for lunch again, on 9/6.  We were gonna only have some noodles, but we couldn't resist ordering some entrees.  We had Hong Kong style chow mein with Chinese broccolli and pork, deep fried tofu, Chinese beef stew with turnips, and an order of Steamed chicken with ginger sauce.  The chicken was only mediocre, but everything else was very good.  The deep friend tofu is pretty simple -- just small pieces of tofu rolled in corn starch and deep fried.  But I love tofu so this dish is really comfort food for me.  My wife loves noodles, especially Hong Kong style noodles -- but of course, our favorite noodle style is "Hawaiian cake noodle"  -- on available in Hawaii or Hawaiian-style Chinese restaurants.    This style of noodles came about due to a cooking error many years ago.  A restuarant in Hawaii was boiling noodles for some soup noodle dish and overcooked the noodles -- they came out overcooked and squooshy.  Not wanting to waste the noodles, they put oil in a pan and fried the noodles until one side was crispy and then they flipped it over and fried the other side until crispy.  This way, the outside of the "noodle cake" is crispy and brown, but the insides are soft and chewy.  These days the technique has been perfected such that when the overcooked noodles are removed from the pot, they are drained but not rinsed -- this keep as much starch on the noodle and when fried, the starch makes the noodle stick together -- try making it at home.  It is delish!! Put your favorite Chinese noodle toppings on it, especially if it has a little bit of gravy with it.

OK; went to pick up takeout on Saturday, around 11:30 am, so I could be home in enough time to eat and watch the D-Backs game on TV.  Decided to go here instead of driving all the way to Phoenix to eat at Diamonds.  So I only ordered four dishes this time, but it was enough for us.  Order Hong Kong style chow mein with beef and gailan; mapo tofu (for my wife); deep fried spareribs with spicy salt; and Chinese beef stew with turnips (naunam).  Everything was OK, but the spareribs were excellent if you like deep fried spicy things.  The mapo was a little too spicy and could have used a little more "something" -- maybe garlic, etc.??    But I was satisfied and still think this place is good, especially for the prices.

I guess I would rate this place as 3.5 stars.  Four of us went for dinner last night and enjoyed ourselves.  We started with some beers and some frozen margaritas.  Like a good restaurant should, they immediately took our bar order and brought our drinks quickly--smart, they make more money on booze than on food.  We ordered a large quesadilla with cheese and chicken to share and that was pretty good.  For dinner we ordered 4 combo dinners -- combo enchilada dinner, combo enchilada and avocado tostada dinner, combo enchilada and taco dinner, and the carnitas dinner.  All pretty good -- not outstanding but good.  Service was acceptable especially since they were pretty busy on a Friday night.  The chips were excellent but only one kind of mild and unexciting salsa.  And they charge for any extras like extra salsa, extra sour cream, extra guacamole, etc. etc.  I guess that is OK to prevent the pigs for ordering so many condiments and running them broke.  All in all, we will be back.  We were satisfied.....again pretty good service, decent food, but not food that I would say was outstanding.  And BTW, they have an extensive menu, but pretty standard Sonoran dishes; nothing unique or intriguing.

Went with family last nite again.  Reduced my rating by two stars due to a few things that irked me.  1)  Made reservations but when we got there, they did not have table reserved for us.  So they put two tables together to accomodate my party -- one table had wobbly legs and was unevenly matched to the other table.  2)  Then they screwed up our drink order  -- got the plain and frozen strawberry margaritas reversed.  Also got the cadillac margarita without salt reversed with the regular one with salt.  3) Forgot to serve one of our appetizers. 4) and lastly, one drink arrived after we had finished eating.  No offer to exchange the drinks to make them right, and no comp from the bill as a token of apology --- did not expect them to take a meal off, but they could have at least taken one drink or one appetizer off the bill.

My wife and I went to Chodang on Friday for lunch.  They were pretty darn crowded, but service was good and fast -- I was pleasantly surprised.  As some other posters have said, the menu is limited but their tofu soups are excellent.  My wife ordered her favorite seafood tofu soup and I had mandoo tofu soup.  Both were excellent with the stone bowl of rice.  Since I knew we were going to still be hungry with only soup, I order a lunch portion of Tonkatsu (pork cutlet).  I was pleasantly surprised that the lunch portion was two good sized cutlets, a green salad, with a side order of potato salad.  It also came with soup and the standard banchans.  We were satisfied with both the price, quality, and amount of food.  We still will go back again and I have not noticed a drop-off of quality like some other poster may have mentioned.

Wife and I went for lunch again on Monday, 4/25/11.  Was rather disappointed.  They have new waitresses who provided mediocre customer service at best.  Something must be causing the high turnover with the wait staff.  Been there at least six times over the last couple of years and everytime, there is new wait staff.  The menu is the same and still the food is "not bad" but we noticed a couple of things -- the banchan ("small, side dishes") was rather skimpy this time and not very good.  Further I ordered the tonkatsu lunch (which I have had three times before) and this time the pork cutlets were very, very thin.  This creates very dry and leather-like fried cutlets.  My wife had the tofu soup again and said that it was pretty much the same.  It is still a "not bad" place to eat, but they are losing their edge over other dining choices.

These guys are weird business dudes.  They advertise their services, but when you ask for quotes or repair estimates, they go underground and don't respond.  WTF?

We went with friends again on Friday night, 7/15.  Once again, the food was good and plentiful.  Pretty much the same things as they always have, but we especially like the deep friend, sweet-sour rock fish.  We also like the kalbi and fried Maryland crabs.  Of course they have many, many other good things on the menu, but these are our favorites.  They used to have an item that had shiitake mushrooms, bamboo shoots, fried tofu, and some veggies in a rich sauce, but they took that off the menu -- probably because only a few people (like me) liked it.  Prices are now a little higher, like about $18 for the weekend dinner, but the senior price is $15.88.  Still a good deal if you are a big eater like our family members.  Just thought I would post this update for others to read.

Just an update.  My kids and their families all came for Thanksgiving so on Friday, I took them all here for dinner since most of them like this place.  Nothing significant to report on regarding changes, but there were a few changes that were noticed.  On that night, they did not have the deep fried, sweet/sour rock fish and I was disappointed since I love that dish.  They also did not have the steamed flounder with oil, ginger, and green onions -- another disappointment for me.  But they did have larger more succulent oysters on the half shell which were pretty good.  One comment and perhaps a suggestion for this establishment -- as one of the more westernized dishes, they have roast beef.  This dish is very bad since they use a bad cut of meat and they roast it until it is dried up and shriveled like an old boot.  They would be better office just cutting the beef up and braising the meat in some kind of tomato based sauce or even some Asian ginger/soy sauce.  This way the meat will be tender and juicy (with the sauce).  Oh yeah, they also had grilled "monka ika" on the grilled foods counter.  Monka ika is the larger cuttle fish and it was very tender and a great addition to the menu.  This surprised me since monka ika is expensive due to its size and its tender meat even though the species is very larger -- it was very good.

An update -- I have always been a big supporter and a fan of Pacific Seafood Buffet.  But me thinks not anymore.  Went there for dinner last night, which was Tuesday night.  The menu was basically the same and most things were still pretty consistent and good.  But they had a few items that were not-so-good.  Their Korean kalbi short ribs were very tough and overcooked.  Their fish dishes were using poorer quality fish so they were not as tasty, their mapo tofu is getting less and less tasty.  But the kicker that pushed me over the edge to now say that I am no longer a fan is that they have been advertising on their home mailer flyers coupons for $1.00 off for lunch and $2.00 off for dinner.  These flyers have "cut out" coupons on them that automatically tells you that you need to bring the coupons with you.  But on the top of the flyer is says seniors (60+) get 20% off all the time.  When we had dinner last night, they would not give me and my wife our senior citizen's prices since we did not bring the flyer with us.  I explained that the flyer says nothing about bringing the flyer and in fact, it says 20% off for seniors everyday now.  Still they would not give me our discounts.  So I paid full price.  I know someone who works at PSB and asked them about this and I was told (I know this is a rumor) that this has been discussed with the management and owners, along with the fact that the website pricing is wrong too, and the staff have been told that these "strategies" help the establishment bring in more customers and get more revenue from customers.  WTH???  So is there is a conscious effort in-place to falsely advertise prices and mislead potential customers?  Assuming that what I was told is true, this seems like economic suicide to me and is also illegal.  So Yelpers, just beware and cautious.  The food is still OK, but deteriorating slightly, but this new information is very troubling to me.

Update-I really did not want to go here, but my granddaughter and grandson wanted to eat here so I acquiesced.  The food is basically the same as always but some things are less adequate or maybe going downhill a little.  I think is is a cost control issue, especially with the economy still being in the dumps.  They don't serve the deep-fried, sweet-sour rock fish anymore.  I know that this dish is expensive but very good.  And they only serve a little bit of tuna (maguro) sashimi at a time.  In fact, I went back to the sashimi/sushi counter three times during dinner and did not get even one piece.  People wait for them to put out a little bit (like maybe 12 pieces) and they rush to grab it.  I saw one kid take every piece of sashimi from the counter, including the other types as well.  And I saw one family wait until they brought out a new container of snow crab legs and rush up with four dinner plates and take every last piece of crab legs -- I would estimate about 12 pounds worth --- good thing that crab legs is not my thing.  But I must admit that I was thinking that these people must have no class since they act like greedy pigs and I think I could even hear them grunting when they were eating.

Went again for lunch today with my GF.  We had roasted red peppers hummus with pita bread for an appetizer.  She had a large Greek salad with chicken for her lunch, and I had the gyros platter with rice, roasted veggies, and a side salad.  Big, big servings and I think the taste was improved.  The salad dressing was flavorful and my gyros was not dry as the last time.  The pita bread was fresh and very soft.  We had too much to eat and brought a doggie bag home.  We will be back!  The owner was very friendly and accommodating and that makes for a nice dining experience!

Wife and I went to have lunch and try their pizza buffet that they recently reintroduced. While the pizza was pretty good and on-par with their normal pizza menu offerings, we were still disappointed. They do not have salad now (which they used to have) and their pasta is very similar to their pasta offerings EXCEPT that their is no meat or chicken in the pasta offerings. If their was any meat or chicken, it was in such small quantities that you could not see it or tell. They do have a small side salad for additional cost, but that too is very, very small. While their pizza is normal, the rest of the buffet is substandard. For the price, CiCi's is better, even if the pizza is of lesser quality.

Was just reading up on restaurant reviews and noticed that I had not posted on this establishment.  WTH??? Maybe postings drop off after two years or something??  In any event, I have eaten here maybe 50 - 100 times over the last 30 years or so.  I was there again this past Friday night and ate a little bit for dinner.  Started off with my standard double long pours of Maccallan 18 scotch, and had a small spinach salad.  Then the big (24 oz only now; when I started coming to this restaurant eons ago, the big cut was 36 oz.) prime rib - rare.  Had the steamed veggies too, but no starch -- no bread, no potato, no rice.  Everything was very good as usual, including the service from my favorite server that I request by name.  I ate all the spinach salad, but only about 1/4 of the prime rib -- took the rest home for my three kids (dogs) and they ate it for their dinner already.  No dessert cause I was full -- I cannot eat as much in my old age, but I did have two iced teas to drink.  I love this place, both for the food and for the service!

OK; let me begin by saying this not a golf review, so you golfers can stop reading -- just joking.  I want to share my observations about their wedding services and catering.    I was invited to my niece's wedding held here.  I was pleasantly surprised by everything.  I was told by my brother (the bride's father) that this wedding event was a package deal that was purchased from Bear's Best, but since he was lucky enough not to have to pay for it, he did not know how much it costs.  I don't know too -- but I would guess that while the prices might not be too outrageous, it can't be cheap too, since everything was pretty outstanding.  The wedding ceremony was held on the grass with folding chair seating for the guests.  Nothing special, but nice.  And they provided the music and the Chaplin and everything.  Then we had a one hour cocktail hour with open bar (beer, wine, liquor, cocktails) and a little bit of appetizers --- fruits, crudites, nuts, chips, cheese and crackers.  Just perfect with cocktails and not too heavy with the dinner coming.  Then dinner was served buffet style -- mixed field greens and berries with a vinaigrette dressing, roasted red potatoes, sauteed mixed veggies, Chibbata rolls, Chicken Piccata, and prime rib roast beef.....I had two slices of rare prime rib and it was good.  The food was surprising good for catered event with a big crowd.  The rolls were hot and good; the veggies warm and not overdone; the beef was cooked perfectly, etc. etc.  And most importantly, it all tasted good and not blah or mundane.  Dessert was wedding cake and gourmet cup cakes.  And they had a "favors" table with chocolate dipped strawberries, gourmet chocolate pops, and red velvet cake pops dipped in a sugar glaze that hardened with the red velvet pop inside.    And I think Bear's Best  provided everything, even the music for dancing and the DJ.  I think they also provided the photographer.  Service was great and the coordinator stays with the party from the very beginning until the last guest goes home.  So all-in-all, I think this place is pretty darn good.

We went there on Friday since the newpaper review was good and the info provided said that these people were the old owners of Bangkok Express in Tempe.  To be honest, we were pretty disappointed....the prices were a little high and the food was mediocre at best.  The curries were not very tasty and did not have much meat or vegetables in them.  We had two of them and both of them were disappointing.  We tried their curry puffs and they were not so good too --- just filled with slightly currified mashed potatoes and not very tasty.  Their fish cakes were OK.  We also ordered their pad thai and that was disappointing.  The taste was very vinegary and not what we used to have at Bangkok Express.  But the worse thing was the BBQ chicken.  At the old Bangkok Express, this BBQ chicken was rubbed with thai spices (dry) and grilled or broiled.  It was juicy and tasty.  This time the chicken was cooked in some kind of soy based sauce and boiled.  Pretty nasty and the chicken tasted like it was leftovers from a few days before and warmed up.    I don't think we will go back there again.  Thai Rama is certainly better.  We also miss the old Char's.

Wifey wanted Greek food yesterday, specifically gyros.  So I wanted someplace quick and easy -- get in and get out, since I was preoccupied with all the games on TV.  So I went here and ordered three dinner plates but asked that the food be all packaged separately so the things would not get mooshed together when I drove home.  So I ordered two gyros dinners and one chicken schwarma dinner.  Overall I think that everything was OK, but I wished the gyros was juicier and had more spice in it.  It was a little bland and dry, probably due to being on the spit all day.  The chicken schwarma was OK, but I was expecting grilled chicken -- my bad; did not know what I was ordering.  The Greek salad was very good, but the dressing was very strong with a high amount of herbs in it, specially Greek oregano.  Next time I will order maybe ranch dressing.  They gave a big portion of yellow, saffron rice which was very good and tasty.  The pita bread was fresh and soft.  But the worse thing was that they forgot the taziki sauce!!  Bummer -- so I had to use Italian seasoning in sour cream when I got home.  Not the same without the taziki!  I had to wait a little bit, but the owner was very nice and gave me a small iced tea, gratis, and an order of baklava.  That was very nice of him.    I know that this is probably asking too much, but I wish I could find a fast food type of place where I can get the Greek lamb shanks.  I really like that.

Went for lunch yesterday with my GF.  She had the chicken gyro pita with salad, and I had the gyro dinner platter with salad, rice, and pita.  Both meals were pretty good, but the gyro meat was slightly on the dry side.  But it was good and the prices were fair.  Next time I am in the mood for Greek food again, I will certainly go back.

My GF and I both like Greek food, and I decided we should have an early, big lunch before we head to the airport to catch our flight to Washington State, since we won't be having dinner till after 8 pm tonight. So we went here and ordered two dinners -- My GF had a chicken kabob dinner and I ordered the combo gyros and lamb kabob dinner. They were freaking huge!!! Both came with two big dinner salads as starters. Then we got the meats with rice and grilled veggies. My GF's kabob had 8 pieces of chicken breast, and I got 8 pieces of lamb chunks on my kabob. My gyro meat was in slices; about half a pound of it. We both couldn't finish the meal and took some home so K can feed the kids with it tonight. When I cannot finish the meal, you know it must be huge!!

I have been a Costco customer for eons, and I have always been very satisfied with them.  But this last summer, I was going to use one of their vendor/subcontractor services for buying and installing new hardwood flooring in my home.  Eventually, I went to someplace else.  This vendor/subcontractor gave me the worse customer service you can imagine.  Misquote (or quoted) 3 different prices on different occasions; claimed he couldn't remember dealing with us despite us being in his store on 3 different occasions; wouldn't come out to bring samples and insisted we come to his showroom; and the last straw was when he was a no-show for a measurement appointment in our home.  While he was only a vendor/subcontractor, my complaints to Costco headquarters went unanswered.  I wrote letters; called their HQ; and even went thru customer service on their website -- all to no avail.  The only conclusion I can draw is Costco doesn't want to hear about problems, they just wish complaining customers just go away. The purpose for this posting is to perhaps warn Costco customers not to use vendor/subcontractor services -- dealing with Costco directly might be OK, but not their vendor/subcontractors.

My wife and I decided to get some sushi for dinner on Saturday.  We have been here by ourselves and friends and family over a dozen times already.  Still pretty damn good for the price.  The $19.95 all you eat menu is great -- many nigiri and maki sushi choices, appetizers, entrees, salads, etc. .... and all you can eat.  Just make sure you eat everything you order and don't waste.  John, the owner is always gracious and generous.  Even bought me a beer on Saturday, and made some special sushi for my wife.  While they don't have everything on the all you can eat menu, what is there is pretty good.  Their maguro is generally grade B maguro, but what do you expect for the price?  But their hamachi is always grade A -- from Japan.  I asked John about that and he said he orders the grade A Japan Hamachi because it tastes the best for sushi.  If you order some Hamachi cooked or broiled, he uses San Diego hamachi which is from warmer waters and not as oily and not as pricey.  But his albacore appetizer is very good -- remember, the pricing is fabulous!

OK went there again a week or so ago.  Things haven't changed.  Same menu, same price, same good service, same good quality.  Again, not the best sushi and they do not have the expensive sushi ingredients, but what do you want for $19.95 all-you-can-eat?  Even my son who lives in Los Angeles and is a sushi afficionado says that for $19.95 you just can't go wrong.  There one cent beer sale price also applies to the large Japanese beers too.  So for $4.76 you can get 44 ounces of Kirin/Asahi/Sapporo.

OK; we went again last night.  However, we were pretty disappointed.  Their beer specials are gone so all beers were priced at retail.  Not necessarily a problem, but makes their price/value ratio less attractive.  Same thing with the sushi -- same pricing for the all-you-can-eat and 50% off for ala carte orders, but the quality was really disappointing.  All my fish orders of nigiri were with old fish and they were not of high quality and not fresh.  My wife's unagi sushi had old and skinny/boney unagi on it.  And my albacore tataki was with old fish too -- all dried up and discolored.

Went again last night, 7/18. My brother-in-law from Louisiana was in and he wanted to eat a lot of cheap sushi so we took him there. John, the owner, was making sushi last night and that was good. His menu and choices are the same as what he offered for last couple of years, and so is his prices and his quality of the food. We had his $19.95 AYCE offering and as usual, we got our money's worth. His sushi and quality of the fish is average at best, but he still offers grade A hamachi from Japan. I find that nice but very strange since Japan hamachi is super-expensive, but he offers that, even for his AYCE price. So if you are a hamachi lover, this is a super deal.   The thing that I really like (not trying to be a prima donna) is that he remembers us and some other idiosyncrasies and nuances. We had not been to his restaurant for about 10 months, but we have been there a total of about six times over the last three years. Since he remembered us as being good customers, he bought my BIL and me a drink. My wife as ill at home so only my daughter and my BIL and his wife were with me. Towards the end of the meal, I told him that my wife was ill at home and wanted me to bring her some takeout sushi for dinner. So I ordered a shrimp tempura roll for her, and I also ordered a California roll for her. John said, that since he remembered that my wife loves his salmon skin hand roll (temaki) and his unagi nigiri, wouldn't she prefer that? I was shocked that he remembered those details. So I told him that would probably be nice. So he made up a shrimp tempura roll, an unagi nigiri, and a salmon skin temaki. He only charged me for the shrimp tempura roll. Now I call that not only great customer service, but great marketing as well. He not only remembered good customers, but he took care of us and made sure that we will come back again.

An Update:  Went for dinner on Saturday nite with my family and my son and his family from LA who came to visit.  Eight of us total.  Five of had the $19.95 AYCE and three had ala carte -- my five year old granddaughter ate some sushi; my DIL ate mostly 50% off sushis; and my wife had one 50% off roll and her hamachi kama.    I appreciate the fact that they take care of us and remember us as being "good customers" (I assume).  As soon as we walked in and sat down, the owner's wife bought my son and I a drink.  And of course my son, DIL, and myself had about six more drinks that we paid for.  They also gave us some of the ala carte orders gratis, so the entire bill (without tip) was really reasonable -- $155.  The quality of the sushi, fish, appetizers, and entrees are still the same --- pretty good; not outstanding nor bad.  We had two orders of the tataki, which was pretty good.  I had an order of squid (actually tako) salad and that was good.  The gyoza was OK (frozen kind) but good.  The teriyaki short ribs were good; and some of the other non-sushi items were also very good.  The hamachi was outstanding, the smoked salmon and fresh salmon were outstanding too.  The sea bass, albacore, unagi, tako, ebi, sanma, ika, and salmon skin rolls were OK.  Actually nothing was bad and some of the items were outstanding.  I saw my son sneaking in a couple of orders of uni and ikura, which are not on the AYCE menu, but I never saw these items on my bill.  Oh yeah, on the weekends it is one penny for the second beer (on a per person basis) -- even the big Japanese beers.  I drink the 22 oz. Asahi Super Dry beers and I had four of them (My step son drove).  So I paid $5.50 + $0.01 twice for my drinks.  My son drank his first free drink and then had two large beers and two tokurris of sake.  So for his, I paid $11.00 + $0.02 twice.    So the the pricing, the good customer service, and the pretty decent food, you just cannot go wrong here.  Sure, it is not the greatest sushi bar with the greatest seafood offerings around, but all things considered, I think Orient Sushi Grill is very good!!!

Update -- went again with my son's and their families.  Seven of us in total.  We all ate the $20 AYCE sushi and entrees.  Still a smoking deal, especially if you are a big eater.  And while the sushi is not the best, it is passable and worth the $20.  As usual the owner's wife recognized us immediately and brought over three glass of chardonnay, gratis.  My DIL is the wine drinker so we gave her all three glasses to drink with her dinner and she was happy.  I drank three 22 oz. bottles of Asahi and my son drank two large tokkuris of sake and one 22 oz. Asahi.  The other son drank soda since he does not drink alcohol.  My granddaughter ordered some things ala carte, although she is only 6 years old.  She knows what she wants -- she order a side of tuna belly sashimi and a kappa maki roll, sliced, with ikura poured over the top of the slices.  I think her two ala carte orders was more than the AYCE sushi price -- ha, ha, ha.  I like this place.  I would recommend it to anyone who want to eat a lot of decent (not great) sushi.

Just an update.  Went again on Friday night with one of my sons and my other son and his family.  Total of six of us -- five adults and one child, my granddaughter.  My GD ordered off the menu and only ate a couple of sushis and some pot stickers.  But the rest of us did the AYCE thing for $20 per person.  My DIL probably ate enough to make it worth her paying the AYCE price, but the rest of us, four guys, ate at least double what we paid, so this deal is pretty darn good for us.  And the quality of the sushi and the fish is relatively good -- not super fresh or of the highest quality, but definitely passable.  A lot of places now offer AYCE sushi, but this place includes a nice selection of appetizers and entrees in the AYCE price, along with the sushi.  Yes, you read correctly -- for the AYCE price of $20, you can stuff your face with sushi, various appetizers, various salads, and various entrees.  If you cannot get your money's worth into your face, your appetite is not conducive to AYCE eating.  Now over the years, the entrees and appetizer quality and quantity has dropped a little, but still passable.  I can understand this strategy -- they have to cut costs with all the sushi people like me eat.  That is OK with me, just don't mess with the sushi varieties, quality, and freshness.    And they still have the weekend promo of buy one beer at regular price but get the second beer for one cent.  So we were drinking the large, 22 oz. Asahi beers but my DIL  just wanted a small one.  But they ran out of that size so they gave her a big one but charged her only the small one's price plus one cent.  That was a good deal and I think very nice of them to compensate for them running out of stock.  I am still a fan and will go back again, and again, and again ........

One of my go to places for sushi due to the reasonably good sushi and prices.  But at the risk of spoiling it for myself, I will add an additional star for my meal on Friday.  I went by myself for a quick lunch (yes lunch) but decided on having the AYCE sushi and a couple of beers (due to the 1 cent offering).  But on this day they also had blue fin toro on the AYCE menu for a mere $2 more!!  Yes, just $2 more, even if you ate 20 order of toro.  I still wanted variety so I "only ate" 4 orders or toro, and 6 order of various other nigiri choices.  Boy, what a deal!!!  Hope to luck out one day and get toro again the next time I go back.

Went for a late lunch on Saturday, 4/14.  The three of us -- wifey, daughter, and me.  We were all pleasantly surprised with the good food and realistic prices.  I was a little concerned about the reviews about the slow service and I can see why -- they only have one server, a nice and efficient girl, but if they get busy, I can see where it would be a problem.  But luckily, there were only two other tables and us, so the service was good.  They have a haole sushi guy -- while this is not too unusual, it is sort of funny for a Japanese restaurant that is trying to make themselves seem authentic (but I think it is owned by Korean people).  But I must admit, this guy did a good job making nicely shaped nigiri sushis, and was pretty efficient.  We ordered three meals -- My wife had the assorted tempura meal; my daughter had the teriyaki chicken and Calif roll meal; and I had the tonkatsu and beef teriyaki meal.  All three meals were OK -- not outstanding but pretty good.  We also ordered some nigiri -- two orders of maguro (actually ahi, which was surprising fresh and nice for flash frozen fish), two orders of smoked salmon, one order of hamachi, and one order of sea bass.  All were pretty good -- I was impressed with the freshness of the fish and the quality of the hamachi, even though I could tell that the hamachi was not Japan hamachi.    The women had two green teas and I had two large Asahi Super Dry beers.  With their $7.00 off coupon, I paid only $60 for this nice meal.  So we all agreed that we would be back for dinner at another time.

After giving this place a good review the last time I was here, last night's episode has made me angry at this place and causes me to recommend that people do not go here unless they want poor service and want to give business to a disreputable establishment.  My wife, daughter and I went for dinner last night since it was their anniversary celebration and they had a special menu and special pricing.  We got there at about 5:45 pm and the place was already packed and we had to put our name on the waiting list.  There was one other party of four ahead of us.  While we waited three other parties of four and two parties of three came along and put their names on the list.  From the banter and greetings from the staff, it was apparent that the staff knew some of these other parties.  After the one party of four that was ahead of us got seated, three other parties, who were after us, were seated ahead of us -- we can only assume that they got seated before us because the staff knew them.  We complained about this but they ignored our complaint and did not even have the courtesy to respond.  So we left.    I think that this is a pretty crappy way to run their business and to treat other customers in this way.  And one other thing --- being a Vegas junkie, I have come to recognize the old saying, "money talks, and crap walks".  The reason why I mention this old saying is because between me and my family, we eat and drink at least 2-3 times the average person.  So this establish has just lost the business of some very good customers.  But I guess they don't give a damn.

Went here for lunch today.  They are pricey -- more than Sizzler's and more than SouperSalad. But their menu items are much more extensive/numerous. But we were disappointed. The salads were nothing to talk about; the salad dressings were watery and flavorless. Being Asian Celebration month, they had a lot of Asian salads and soups, and two noodle dishes -- curry veggies with rice noodles, and noodles with tofu and chicken broth. But no depth of flavor to any of the Asian dishes --- I think the basic problem is that their Asian items had no meat in them, including no meat stock for the broth. So they were rather bland and tasteless. Oh yeah, their tuna noodle salad had so little tuna in it, we couldn't see it! Maybe the tuna just swam thru the salad before serving it.

I always have customer service problems with Fedex.  How the heck did they get to be so big with the crappy way they treat customers?  I use the Internet a lot for purchases and about 60% of the time, they screwed-up and then their customer service has major difficulty fixing the problems.  I have asked for shipments to be held at the closet shipping location to my office and they ship to my home.  Another time I asked for the same thing and they held it at the regional depot instead of where I asked that it be sent.  I can go on and on about the screw-ups I have experienced with Fedex.    But this time they really pissed me off.  I get a harassing phone calls from a collection agency that says they have been contracted by Fedex to collect an overdue bill from me in the amount of $4000+.  I have asked them for details and all I get is harassment.  So I asked Fedex for help and customer service told me to contact Fedex Revenue Services, which I did.  I told them that I am getting harassing phone calls from XYZ collection agency and the person who keeps calling is named Chris.  I also tell them that the alleged amount owed is $4000+ and the account is supposedly in my name.  So I ask that they investigate and tell me if I indeed have an overdue account in my name for this amount.  (I know I do not have such an account!).  Fedex then tells me that they cannot help me because I have not provided enough information.  WTF?  How much more information can I provide?  Do they want my height and weight?  Maybe my blood type?  Maybe I have to provide the names and birth dates of my children too?  This is why I say that Fedex really blows!

I cannot find the appropriate division for FEDEX Ground on Yelp, so I am just updating my previous posting.  I still think FEDEX sucks.  Today, I was scheduled to receive a shipment which arrive rather early at 11 am or so.  I was please by this, but when I got the box inside my home, I noticed that it wasn't my box, but addressed to someone else.  By this time the driver had left so I had to call FEDEX to report the problem.  About some time later, the same driver returns with another box and I trade boxes with him.  I ask if he was sure this was my box and he says yes.  So I look at the label and again it isn't my box.  So I tell him that he is mistaken again and he has to search the back of his truck for my box.  He finally finds the right box and gives it to me.  He hops back into his truck and with the rear doors open, he drives off quickly.  Since the back door is open, about 6 boxes fall out onto the pavement.  Now in my mind, there is no wonder that FEDEX sucks and peoples orders get either screwed up or destroyed.  And further, this young kid driver, seemed to be DUI.

Once again, FEDEX Ground screws up big time!  I waited all day at home and nobody ever rang the doorbell.  The moron driver just left a note saying nobody was home so my delivery was cancelled.  HTF can nobody be home??  I was here all day!!!  Like I have said in my previous reviews, FEDEX hires idiots and morons as drivers!

Update-This proves that FEDEX is comprised of morons and idiots!  I sent in a complaint to HQ asking that their driver ring the door bell as opposed to just assuming nobody is home and leaving without making the delivery.  The response I got this morning (48 hours later) said this: " We are sorry for your experience.  If you want to confirm who accepted the delivery, click here."  WTF??  How is that response related to my complaint/inquiry?  OMG!  They really are idiots and morons!!

Man, I still cannot find FEDEX Ground so I can rightfully review them again.  So once again, I have chosen to write this review on a Fedex Ship Center, even tho' my review is for Fedex Ground.  I hate to buy from online retailers who ship via Fedex Ground -- Fedex Ground screws up 80+% of the time.  I cannot believe that this happens nationwide, but maybe Fedex Ground here is Phoenix just sucks!!  Fedex Ground uses subcontractors -- even if the truck is logo'ed Fedex Ground they are all subcontractors.  And they suck!!  I had two items ship on 11/17.  I checked shipping progress four times -- 11/17 at nite; 11/18 in the morning; 11/18 at nite, and 11/19 in the morning.  Each time it showed a different delivered time.  Each time I checked, the delivered date as 11/19/, 11/20, Pending, and 11/20.  So I leave to run errands yesterday morning and lo and behold the shipment delivery is attempted and taken back due to nobody being home.  WTF does this happen 80+% of the time.  Are these guys morons?

Let me begin with this comment-this is a 3 star buffet, but I give them four stars due to their price!  Went to lunch there yesterday to give them a try.  I was pretty impressed for only $10 per head.  They have a very nice salad bar, a dim sum station with about 6 choices, and some other hot food selections.  While admittedly the buffet is small and limited, what was offered was pretty good.  There was no "big beef" entree, but that day they were offering smoked pork ribs which were pretty darn good.  And surprisingly, the dim sum was excellent -- better than what the more notable dim places in Phoenix offer.  I was happy.  Oh yeah, they had a very nice salmon entree with huge fillets of salmon.  Only thing the salmon was pink and not silver or red -- oh well, what do you expect for only $10!

Went for lunch again yesterday.  This update is to confirm my previous impressions about this buffet.  Dim Sum still excellent, although limited in selection.  Salad bar is good and my GF said that their spinach/mandarin orange/walnut/feta salad was outstanding!  They also had what they called pork canitas on the menu yesterday and that was sliced and served from the carving station.  I thought that this was an excellent entree since it was not the typical shredded carnitas that you generally get.  And I believe they used boneless pork shoulder which left some strips of fat within each slice of meat, with the carnitas seasoning generously rubbed on the exterior of the meat, just like dry rubbed BBQ beef brisket.  So again, this place is pretty darn good in my opinion.

OK; just another update here.  But I felt the need to update.  Went to lunch here again yesterday and I gotta tell you that I was very happy.  They had a spinach/mandarin orange/candied walnuts/feta cheese salad that my GF just loved!  They also had as another choice - Ceasar Salad, which was very good and I loved it.  They had roasted loin/filet of beef on the carving table and that was very, very good -- especially since it was rare and I like it that way.  They had Italian Sausage and peppers that was also excellent!  I always get a few dim sum selections too, and this time they had stewed tendons (which might sound yucky to some, but I love that stuff), and they had shrimp/pork won tons in soup which were very good!  And all this (along with a lot of other things that I did not mention) for $10.  Oh yeah, they also had curried chicken which also was very good.

WTF!!!  As you know, I like this place a lot!  For its food.  But they never post their menu on their website and when you call, nobody knows what's on the menu for the day.  How stupid is that.  So I called again today and they put me thru to their Food And Beverage Department and they picked up the phone and hung up on me.  I know this for a fact because I called back 3 times and each time the operator connected me to F&B, this happened.  How freaking stupid and inconsiderate is that?  Perhaps we should not frequent this place again.

Went for lunch on 6/26.  Just my wife and I, but we planned to take out the leftovers for another meal too.  So we ordered a couple of the $5.00 dishes and two other things -- a whole roast duck and Chinese beef stew.  Everything was pretty good and I was not disappointed.  However, the roast pork was not as juicy and I would have liked.  I was crispy, but the meat was a little dry.  But all-in-all, it was pretty good.  I would go back again with more people when we return to Vegas in July.

My wife and I went there yesterday for lunch and we were not disappointed.  I had the pho and my wife had the crepe.  We also ordered a couple orders of spring rolls and an order of the lotus root salad.  Everything was pretty good; not the best -- but taking into consideration the prices, this place is great.

I am sorry, but my impressions are total different that the other reviewers.  I am a stickler for customer service and Total Wines has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  I am a relatively big purchaser of high-end wines, not only for my consumption but for consumption by my wine "club" who meet regularly to try new wines -- especially the high-end, highly rated wines.  I am not exaggerating, but on at least 8 ocassions, I have called a number of stores, sent faxes and emails, and have never ever received a call-back or a response.  This is also true about their corporate offices.  HQ also never responds to inquiries.  They might have a large inventory, but if you can never find what you want, what good is it?  Also, their online website search capability is sorely lacking in capability.

Yeah; we had breakfast with a restaurant.com coupon again. The breakfast buffet is $15 and with a $15 off coupon, we only paid $15 + tax + tip. A very good deal. My GF had 3 strips of bacon, and a 3 egg bacon/spinach/cheese omelet, and a large waffle with butter and syrup.  I had 4 strips of bacon, one large sausage link, a three egg bacon/onion/mushroom/cheese omelet, some country potatoes, and one piece of marbled bread toast. Then I went back and had 3 eggs scrambled, and two four inch poor boys of swiss and cheddar cheese, salami, ham, pickles, and red onion. Boy was I full!

Went with my GF yesterday to try their Sunday Champagne Brunch.  Price is $27.50 pp but they offer restaurant.com vouchers.  We were pleased and satisfied.  Not the greatest Sunday Brunch in the world, but fully satisfactory for the price.  If anyone is interested in the menu, just message me and I will share the details with you.

I am a homeowner who was fooled into thinking Home Advisors were legit.  It was my fault for not doing my due diligence, and I assumed they were legit and checked out the contractors before recommending them.  I was looking for a particular contractor and send requests for quotes and responses to five of their members.  Only one of them even responded  -- what a farce.  Being the dummy that I am, I used the one that responded.  That contractor did a lousy job and it took him over a week and five trips to fix the problem, that should have taken perhaps a maximum of four hours of work.  So then Home Advisors asks for a rating on this contractor -- when I give the contractor a bad rating with honest, true, and accurate comments, they reject my rating saying that it is not within their rating and review guidelines......what are the guidelines?  That you cannot be honest and accurate in your rating and comments?  WTF?  These guys are rip-off artists and a total scam.  Avoid using them at all costs!!!

Went with my family for dinner last nite.  We all agree with all the comments in the positive reviews of others.  Tip to the wise:  Make reservations.  The place gets packed by 5:00 pm, especially on weekends.  If you don't have reservations, you will experience a 1.5 - 2 hr. wait.  Since it was packed, and it was one of our gals birthdays, they gave us two free desserts -- one for the birthday girl, and one because our dinners came out a little slow because they were so busy.  We got the apple bread pudding and the cappuccino ice cream pie -- both were delicious.  This might not be the classiest or the best Italian restaurant I have experienced, but the food is decent, the prices fair, and the service excellent.  You will not be disappointed!

Went again last nite.  Again, the place was packed and without reservations, you are SOL.  But we made reservations and got seated in about 10 mins.  Service is good, despite them being super busy.  People complain about the food being mediocre, but that is to be expected from a mid-range, family style restaurant.  I think their food is better than Olive Garden, and Bucca de Beppo.  I have no complaints about this place if I want family style, cost-effective dinners.  If I wanted a high-end dinner, I would go to a fancier Northern Italian type of place and pay the price for such food.

Wifey and I were wandering around the Mekong Plaza yesterday, looking for someplace to eat lunch and then we were going shopping at the Mekong Market.  So we looked at a bunch of places and menus, some of which we had already tried before.  Then at the north end, we ran into the Mekong Palace.  Like some other poster said, it looks like they are part of a food court, and their seating section is a sectioned off part of the food court.  We decided to order some dim sum and were not disappointed -- the dishes were good and cheaper than any other dim sum restuarant.  We know this for a fact since we love dim sum and frequent many places in the east valley.  We also tried their house special chow mein noodles and that was pretty good.  Looked at their roast duck, roast pork, and char siu pork and ribs -- all looked good (but did not try) and all was cheaper than most every other place.  Our bill was very reasonable and we were not disappointed.  We probably will be back to try some other menu items.

I just had to write this review because of not only my personal experience, but also because of the bad reviews written by many of the other Yelpers.  I too was skeptical about using Empire Today due to the many poor reviews and the "thousands" of BBB complaints against them.  But in researching the BBB complaints, Empire Today still is given an A+ Rating by the BBB due to two factors -- their willingness to satisfy most of the complaints, and the fact that the percentage of complaints against the "many thousands" of jobs they do is pretty small in the eyes of the BBB.  So I decided to give it a shot and called them for an in-home appointment.  The sales guy was very nice, knowledgeable, and polite.  He answered all our questions and provided many alternatives.  In my case I have a 3000+ sq ft home that I was replacing all the flooring -- all the carpeting and installing new carpet and wood laminate flooring.  Only two small areas of tile were left in-place, and those areas will be replaced soon by Empire.  I negotiate a very good price and even got the "next day" installation that I wanted.  They sent two crews -- the first crew did the carpeting in all the upstairs rooms and down the staircase.  This staircase also has a long, open stairwell, and they had to wrap each stair step with carpeting and cut and install side paneling with each step.  The carpet crew took two days and did a very nice and professional job.  They moved all the furniture and put back each piece exactly where it should have been.  On the third day, they sent the flooring crew.  Same experience -- two very polite, professional, and experienced guys who did the whole downstairs with oak laminate flooring in three days, including mouldings, step-downs, transitions, etc. etc.   Each piece looks like it was cut exactly to fit.  So far I have not seen anything that I don't like.  They also moved all the heavy furniture and put it back when then were thru.    Now only time will tell regarding the quality of the product, the long term effects of their workmanship, and their warranty services.  But for now, I am impressed and very happy.  And I am a hard person to please.  So I guess when you deal with a company like Empire Today that does thousands of jobs, it is the luck of the draw who you get regarding sales and installation.  And although we often see a lot of negative reviews, maybe the positive reviews are never written -- I dunno.  But my experience so far has been very satisfactory and I am happy.

Ok, I am writing this update in an effort to report to other Yelpers about my experience with Empire.  They took 3 days to schedule my warranty repair and took care of the problem on day 4.  I think this type of non-emergency repair time is acceptable.  However, some constructive criticism for Empire - your customer service people need to check their voicemail messages regularly and react accordingly - why allow them to use voicemail if they won't use it appropriately?  After scheduling the repair, I had to cancel due to an unanticipated appointment that came up.  I called and left a voicemail to reschedule.  Apparently customer service did not resched since the carpet guy showed up.  Not being at home, he left and came back in the evening, unannounced, to fix the problem.  This was OK by me, and he took care of the issue.  So I am still happy, but the poor repair guy should not have had to come out in the first place.

I thought I wrote an updated review last year, but apparently I did not.  Since I had used Empire to re-carpet and put down laminate flooring in my previous home, I used them again to replace some carpeting and put down laminate flooring in another home I bought, about a year ago.  I had them replace carpeting and lay laminate flooring instead -- about 1800 square feet of it.  Again, I was extremely please with the service, pricing and job that was done.  In fact, there was a  rounded tile section of the entryway that extended into the great room that was supposed to be sawed with a tile saw and the rounded part cut out and made into a straight edge to facilitate the installation of the flooring.  The installer asked me why I had ordered that, and I said because it would be easier for him to install the flooring.  He said he could saw and angle the transition molding to look like it was a rounded length of transition to match up with the tile and the flooring.  Wow!  Did he do a wonderful job and made it look exactly like he said it would look.  I am a very happy camper!!

OK; this is only a "preliminary" update.  They say that a repeat customer is the most valuable customer, but apparently Empire doesn't see it that way.  We have used them for three previous flooring and carpeting projects (big ones!) and had been satisfied.  Now my GF wants to put down about 400 sf of laminate in our bedroom, replacing the carpeting -- so we called them again.  They came and took measurements and took a DP and said that the job would commence first thing this morning (today) and would probably take only one day.  Then we never heard from them again, despite having called 4 times now.  Well, if they don't call and show up by 8 am, I will be super pissed and will file complaints with the BBB and the Registrar or Contractors.  This is an asinine way to treat good customers, especially since we have used them for three previous projects!  I will provide another update later.

WTH?  Still no returned phone call from Empire, despite calling them again.  What is up with those people?  Customer service skills are nonexistent.  They also advertise $100 gift cards for referrals, but that is not true.  They give you nothing despite providing them with successful referrals.

I don't understand what the heck is going on with this company.  I used them three times  before -- once a couple of years ago to replace about 800 sq feet or carpeting in my upstairs bedrooms, then about 1100 sq feet of downstairs flooring in my old house which I have since sold.  Then again last year to replace about 1200 sq feet of carpet with laminate flooring in another home we bought.  I was extremely satisfied all three times.  Then a few months ago, my GF want to replace the carpeting in the master bedroom with laminate, so we obviously called them again.  The guy who came out to do measurements and the estimate did OK and we did not suspect any coming problems.  He also told my GF that they will give her a $100 gift card if she provides a successful referral to another customer.  Then the problems started:  1.  We never had contact with these people again, despite about half a dozen phone calls to find out our installation date, etc.  We called the sales guy, the manager, etc. and nobody would return our calls. 2.  Then one Saturday morning, a subcontractor shows up to do the job.  Luckily we were home and he did a great job, to our amazement. 3.  My GF provided a referral to another friend of hers and told her friend to tell Empire that my GF provided the referral, which she did.  Her friend also went ahead and ordered a flooring project from them and completed it. 4.  We heard nothing for about a month, so my GF called Empire about 4 times, and again never received a return phone call. 5.  She finally called the general manager and left a message telling him if he does not call back, we will file complaints with the BBB, the registrar of contractors, and the State of AZ. 6.  The guy calls her back and tells her that she won't be getting the $100 referral gift card since she never filled out a claims form, despite nobody ever telling her she needed to do that. 7.  She tells him that she will proceed with her original plan to file complaints.  He then says that she will get her gift card, credited to our credit card, no later than Jan 4, 2016. 8.  Today is January 5th and we have no credit to our credit card. 9.  So we will give them TWO more days to make good on their commitment, and if they do not come thru, we will proceed with filing the complaints that we said we would.

I have been to many of these buffets, including the predecessor one, Jen Buffet, and Pacific Seafood down the street.  My wife and I went last even to try, in response to their advertising about new menu items.  I must say that although the food was good but not outstanding, it was pretty darn good.  They have all the usual Chinese buffet items, along with the noodle bar where you can get your choice of soup noddles.  But I was pleasantly surprise with their generous assortment of seafood for their individual hot pots that each table can have, and they do indeed have fresh Maine lobster -- all you can eat.  The lobster is prepare in a Chinese style -- braised with a brown sauce.  Pretty good and fresh.  I suspect the owner is trying to build a customer base, so go and eat for the cheap price of about $13, before the menu changes or the price ngoes up.  You will not be disapoointed!

Last Friday, 4/15/11, my family and I went to City Buffet as we had been there before on a number of occasions and liked the food.  We were especially partial to City Buffet since their promotional prices and coupons made their buffet a pretty good deal.  So on Thursday afternoon, I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who told me that they accepted ALL COMPETITORS' coupons as well as their own expired ones (as they advertised).  I also inquired about the pricing and was told that the pricing was still $13.99 for dinner on weekdays and $14.99 for the weekends.  I was also told that they offered take out service by the pound which was $5.99 per pound without seafood and $8.99 per pound for their seafood take-out.     We got there and were extremely disappointed and angry: * First of all, after we ate, we were told that they did not accept competitors' coupons, in direct contradiction to what the manager told me; * Their crab legs, braised lobster dishes were very slow to be refilled.  All the other people there were grumbling about this too; * They did not have the fried, cracked crab and the Dungeness crab as they advertised; * And they raised the prices on Thursday nite. Why wasn't I told that when I called on Thursday afternoon? * Further, they did not have a take-out option by the pound.  They charged me the full dinner price for a little container of food that I took for my other daughter who was at home.  I expected the prices to go up or the menu items to diminished since I suspected that their pricing and their menu offerings were "introductory" in nature, but the thing that pisses me off if the use of deception, lying, and false advertising.  The honest provider would publish new prices and new menus and would not give people false information over the phone.  I just drove by the place on my way in to work this morning and the big advertising banners are still up at the restaurant with the false pricing and false menu items.  What deceitful and unethical people own and manage City Buffet in Chandler!!

I don't know if these are corporate restaurants or franchises, but in either case, this particular location is pretty bad.  First of all, we went for dinner at 5 pm and after waiting 20 minutes to get to the ordering counter, they tell us they are out of brisket.  WTH?  What BBQ joint runs out of brisket at 5 pm?  And they don't have a sign in the window or at least a chalk board when you walk in, to tell that there is no brisket????  At least 80% of the 50 or so people behind me want brisket too.  OMG!!!  Their order taking and prep system was designed by the 3 stooges.  3 people trying to help customers and they are trying their best, but their "system" is atrocious.  Instead of using a production line system, each person tries to do everything.  So let's start at the beginning.  You order your plate -- either 1,2, or 3 meats.  Let's say you want a 2 meat plate with pulled pork and smoked turkey.  So the guy goes to the warmer and takes out a pork butt and a turkey breast, all wrapped in saran wrap.  He pulls your portion of pork off and cuts a few slices of turkey breast; wraps the unused portions back up and puts them back into the warmer.  Now the next customer wants pulled pork too, so he goes back to the warmer and takes out the newly wrapped pork butt, that he just re-wrapped 15 seconds ago, pulls off the saran wrap, and preps a portion for the next guy --- WTH?    Now he does this while wearing those food server gloves, which is a good thing.  But then he has to take them off to scoop the sides into little paper cups -- beans, cole slaw, potato salad, etc. etc.  Then he pushes your plate to the girl at the cash register so she can ring you up.  He then goes back to the meat prep station and has to put on gloves again.  Now when the girl at the cash register is done ringing you up, she goes to the meat prep station and puts on gloves to help the next person in line with their order.....like I said, it's like watching the 3 stooges in action.  Meats have very little if any smoke flavor.  Ribs are very salty and the dry rub in not flavorful.  BBQ sauces are thin and have no depth of flavor.  Sides are pathetic -- coleslaw is very similar to coleslaw at KFC....I call this kind of coleslaw grass clippings from my lawnmower--chopped up bits of cabbage and lousy dressing.  Beans came out of a can.  Other sides are meh....but the waffle fries and onion strings are OK.  And to top this all off, they have no burnt ends and no rib tips!  Prices are higher than average for below average food, IMO.    I know this review is critical, but other Yelpers should know that good places from the bad.

After our upsetting visit to Sushiya last nite, we ended up here for dinner.  We had to find someplace fast since my daughter had to work the night shift and we had only 1.5 hours before she had to leave for work.  We wasted over an hour at that darn Sushiya restaurant.  I have been to Crazy's on Priest many, many, many times.  This location is smaller and has better lighting.  And they had some things on the menu that the Priest location does not.  For the price, I think that this place is very good.  They have almost as many items on the menu as Pacific Seafood Buffet, but their pricing is $6 per head less.    My comments:  I loved their hot/sour soup.  I loved their Chinese pickled pigs feet.  I thought their short ribs were OK as was their steam flounder with ginger and onions.  I mentioned in a post of the Priest location that the Italian shrimp scampi and pasta dish was good and they had it here too -- my daughter loved it too and said she was pleasantly surprised that this dish was on a buffet menu and was very good.  Comment of wifey and daughter:  Snow crab legs were smaller than Pacific Seafood, but tasted better since they were steamed and not boiled and left swimming in water like at Pacific Seafood.  The short ribs were more tender here and the pieces of meat were bigger.  Sushi selection here is not as good as Pacific, but for the price, who's complaining?  My wife said the deep fried blue point crabs were very good here.    So in conclusion, we will be back.  Very good value to price ratio.

I wrote an earlier review, but it seems to have disappeared.....no problem.  I just wanted to provide an update.  I have been here at least 6-8 time since they opened and the food is about the same.  So they are not reducing the food choices or quality to save money.  But what I wanted to update the other yelpers about is that they have raised their prices significantly where they no longer have a economic advantage over their like competitors.  Their lunch prices are now $8 although they still advertise that the lunch price is $6.  Why do establishments do this?  Are they just stupid or are they trying to be shysters and mislead the public?  These kind of things really irritate me when businesses do this kind of thing.

I have heard all the bad comments about Allegiant and my belief is they are all valid.  I have not taken my flight yet on Allegiant, but that comes in June.  Contrary to their advertising, they are not a discount airline.  When you add up all their ridiculous and misc charges, their rates are on par with the other airlines.  For me, I have to go to Cedar Rapids, IA, so I have no choice but to fly them since they are the only carrier that flies there.  But my main gripe now is that they do not participate in the TSA Precheck program, so I have to stand in line with everyone else going thru security, and I have to take off my shoes, take off my belt, empty my pockets, and go thru the body imaging scanner.  Why the hell do I have TSA Precheck authorization for anyway??  And additionally, I have a top secret security clearance too!!

OK; here is my update now that my trip has been taken.  I still think Allegiant is the pits.  I don't think I will ever fly them again.  Seats are very hard and uncomfortable and do not recline at all.  You just cannot find a comfortable position to sit in and maybe take a nap.  Our return flight home was cancelled.  Never got a good explanation as to why.  Spoke with five different people -- got answers from "I dunno" to "mechanical issues".  Five different answers -- what a joke.  And once again I stress that they charge for everything, including soft drinks, boarding passes, everything!!!  So when you add all the charges up, it is cheaper to fly other airlines.

Well, I took my girlfriend here for a simple lunch since she never had teppanyaki before.  I wanted her to experience the food and the "show".  I was pleasantly surprised by the nice job the chef did - he put on a decent show, especially for lunch, and provided my girlfriend with some entertainment.  The prices are reasonable and the food is acceptable.  We decided we will come back again and bring her kids so they could experience teppanyaki too.  We were both satisfied with this place and would recommend it to others.

OK; let the haters give me crap, but I don't care.  I like this place.  I asked yesterday about whether this restaurant was still open since the website was down and I could not find any information on this location.  So the responses to my question were not helpful -- just a lot of nonsense from people trying to be funny, I guess.  So I drove up there for a late lunch with my daughter yesterday and found it still open.  We both thought this place was very good.  Let me explain - the entrees like shrimp, steak, fish & chips, ribs, chicken, burgers, etc. etc. are mediocre at best. But the salad bar is super great.  I am a salad bar fan and they have a lot of fresh salad materials, great condiments, and great salad dressings -- whomever makes the salad dressings or whomever they buy them from, makes topnotch salad dressing.  My daughter liked the blue cheese dressing which was creamy and rich (not vinegary) with big, big chunks of blue cheese in it.  The salad part of the salad bar is better than most other salad bars -- like I said, I like salad bars.  Better than Golden Corral, better than Ruby Tuesdays, better than Souper/Salad! and Sweet Tomatoes.  And BTW, the soups were excellent too -- three choices yesterday -- clam chowder, chicken noodle, and broccoli/cheese.  The other part of the salad bar was chicken fingers and Buffalo wings.  They also have a complete taco and tostada bar too, with lots of stuff, including fresh, shredded carnitas.  They even have the tortilla shell bowls for making taco salads.  And FRESH (fresh and super good) guacamole.    Some fruits, jellos, puddings, cakes, cookies, and soft serve ice cream with a lot of toppings.  My daughter said the soft serve was good quality type, similar to McDonald's -- she should know....she is a junk food/fast food expert.  But the best part is that the price for the salad bar is $6.99 (lunch) - AYCE.  And for $3-4 more, you can add a nice entree.  Fish and Chips for $3; Half pound cheese burger with fries - $4, and the same for six, big, deep fried shrimps.  I ate all my food including the salad bar stuff and the entree, but my daughter took her fish and loaded baked potato (substitute for french fries) home.  She said her strategy was going to be to order an entree with salad bar the next time, and again take the entree home for her dinner to eat later.  I kinda agree with her on this strategy, it is certainly worth the price.

Ate lunch here yesterday.  This time I only had the salad bar for $6.99.  Still very good and one of the best deals in town if you include the hot bar too.  Salad material choices are excellent, dressings are rich and thick, good soups, and the hot bar selection is pretty good too.  So even if you take an entree, the price is still an excellent value and worth going for a casual lunch or dinner.

Was running errands with my GF yesterday and decided to stop here for lunch since we love the salad bar, especially with the senior citizens price.  I had forgotten that Sizzlers advertises menudo on the weekends, so I was pleasantly surprised with the offering this Saturday.  The menudo was pretty darn good -- not the best I have ever had, but very good.  It had enough tripe and hominy (in fact too much), but it did not have any cow hooves or shank/ankles, but still tasted pretty good.  As condiments, they had chopped onions and cilantro, but they should have had Mexican oregano and crushed red peppers to round out the condiments.  But all-in-all, it was very good and with the salad bar, it was freaking great!

Who would have thought that a golf course restaurant would have a professionally trained chef handling the food prep and service there?  It was pretty damn good!  We went for breakfast and I had 2 bloody Mary's and an iced tea.  My GF had diet coke.  I ordered the short rib eggs Benedict with jalapeno hollandaise sauce and my GF ordered the spinach, bacon, and feta cheese omelette with a side of ham steak.  Her omelette let her order the fruit instead of the potatoes it was good and huge...about 2 cups full!  The ham steak was also a steak; maybe 8-10 oz. and grilled nicely.  My eggs Benedict was great too, and came with a big serving of rosemary roasted potatoes.  With a discount coupon, we paid only $21 for everything (less tip).  We will be back.

We were so impressed the last time we visited this place, that we had to go again.  Today, I had the "Par 5" Burger With Onion rings.  My GF loved the spinach/bacon/feta cheese omelet so much the last time she had to order it again.  It was all very good and we have absolutely no complaints.  It is very interesting that a neighborhood golf course grill has a professionally trained and talented chef running the grill.

Went for brunch again with my GF and her daughter and SIL.  Again, we were very satisfied.  We had a few bloody mary's and some mimosas, coffee, and iced tea too.  My GF had her normal bacon/spinach/feta cheese omelet with the fruit bowl (she always orders the same thing), and SIL had the bacon, eggs, and blue berry pancakes (two huge ones).  He said they were good.  My GF's daughter and I had the Mulligan Special breakfast -- three eggs, bacon, home fried potatoes, and toast.  This was good, but it was just a standard, simple breakfast.  I was half expecting the chef to do something special, even if the menu did not mention anything different or creative.  I was also a little disappointed in the potatoes too -- they were just plain fried and the last few times, they were fried with rosemary, which gave them some ooomph.  Not complaining -- we still love this place.  Oh yeah, on Sundays it is happy hour all day long, beginning at 6 am.  So the drinks were only $3, and we ordered a big plate of onion rings too, for only $4.  They had other appetizers on the happy hour menu, but we did not want to overdo it.

Went for breakfast again yesterday.  Besides liking this place, we discovered that they offer a bloody mary bar on Sundays during the fall thru spring season.  The last time we went for breakfast, the bloody mary bar had crispy strips of bacon to use as stir sticks, and slices of roast beef to dunk into your bloody mary.  This time the bacon and roast beef were not offered -- boo!  But still a pretty good bloody mary bar.  My GF always orders the bacon/spinach/feta cheese omelet, but substitutes green salad for the potatoes and fruit cup.  They also give you toast too.  She says you cannot believe how great the green salad with ranch dressing goes with her omelet.  I had my Mulligan's Special Breakfast -- 3 eggs, bacon/ham/or sausage, roasted red potatoes, and toast.  It was good as usual, especially since they accept restuarant.com vouchers.  Oh BTW, the bloody mary's used to cost $4.50 -- now they are $4.54 ---- what's up with that?  ROFLMAO!

Went for breakfast again yesterday.  Still good and delicious.  Used a restaurant.com voucher.  When I got home, I got a notice from restaurant.com that Mulligan's is no longer participating in the discount voucher program....good thing I got to use my voucher.  I guess I have to pay full price next time we visit.

Mark is the owner, and his son is Blake.  I had my main, one inch feeder line crack on me and I had to shut down the whole system (all zones) due to this.  I called Mark and lo and behold, he answered his phone.  I explained the problem and he sent Blake who came in less that 2 hours.  He worked for a couple of hours and told me that he had to leave to handle some other commitments and that be would be back.  He did come back later and finished the job very quickly and professionally.  And he invoiced me instead of wanting to be paid immediately (since I had to go out of town the next day).  And his charges are very fair.  I would highly recommend you calling these guys if you need sprinkler repairs done.

OK; I thought I would write this review in all fairness to these folks.  I have a normal plumber that I typically use, but this time I needed some emergency work done a particular brand of water heater still under warranty.  So thru an internet search, I found about 4 places that were authorized service dealers for this brand.  I called and left messages at all four places about 8 am on Thanksgiving morning.  Only two guys returned my call promptly (or even at all) within 15 minutes.  Above and Beyond called back first and by talking with him, I knew that he knew what he was talking about and asked me to check for the model # and serial # of my heater, which I did.  He looked up my product on the manufacturers cross reference data base and said he had to repair part.  He said be would be there by 10:30 AM.  A few minutes after I hung up the phone the other guy called and he too knew what he was talking about.  But I had already made a repair appointment with Above and Beyond and told the second guy this -- he said no problem, just call him back if I needed more help.  By 9:15 AM the husband and wife team of Above and Beyond showed up (early!!!) and fixed my problem by replacing the whole gas valve assembly and ignition unit under warranty, in less than 1 hour.  All I paid for was the emergency service which was higher than normal being Thanksgiving, but still fair for the situation.  I am extremely happy with these people and will probably use them for other plumbing work in the future!!!

Wow!  Good thing I didn't look up the ratings before going there for lunch yesterday.  Otherwise, I probably would not have gone due to the low ratings.  But I am happy I went since I now know of another economical place to get my occasional lunch.  I think this buffet is actually a 3 star place, but I give it 4 stars due to its cheap price.    Essentially, it is pretty much similar to all the other low cost Asian buffet places, but there are a few things that I think gives it a much better rating than the others.  First of all, they have a Mongolian Stir Fry station, which most other buffets have dropped to save costs.  Occasionally, I like Mongolian stir fry, so this is a plus for me.    Secondly, the have a simple Pho station.  This is a good plus for me and for others who like soup noodle dishes.  Too bad they don't add a Chinese soup noodle station, or at least add boiled noodles to the buffet line since they already have both nice pot stickers and nice, big won tons with soup on the buffet line.  They also have a big bowl of chopped green onions too, which most other places don't have on the buffet line for people to use as a condiment/topping (I love green onions).  In fact, I wonder why other buffets don't do this?  Is it because in AZ, most people don't like soup noodle dishes?  I wonder?????  I love it.  Third, they have two great fish dishes on the buffet line.  First, they have white fish fillets that are steamed with ginger, soy, oil, and green onion garnish.  Some places have this too, but most don't due to the cost of fish these days.  And they had a great fried fish dish too -- it looked like black sea bass fillets dusted in corn starch and deep fried.  It tasted pretty good to me, but maybe not black sea bass since that type of fish is super costly.  But the pieces where indeed cross-wise slices of the whole fish body which showed me the rib cage and fillets as well.  The skin was a little black and thick, which is exactly how black sea bass looks.  Oh well, at least it tasted pretty good to me and I am a fish lover.  So I will be back.  Again, not the greatest, but worth adding to my list of cheap eats for lunch.

My GF and I decided to try this place for breakfast today and we were pleasantly surprised.  Upon being seated and our drink order taken, the waitress asked if we wanted some chips and salsa -- we were surprised that they offered chips and salsa even with breakfast, but we said, "sure".  The chips were fresh, crisp, and warm, and the two salsas were good.  Like some other reviewers have complained, the salsas were lacking in salt and not very spicy.  But I think that is a good thing since some people like my GF don't like spicy foods and some people cannot consume much salt.  Just add your own salt and hot sauce to your liking -- I think the restaurant makes their salsas this way on purpose.  We both ordered chicken fried steak and eggs, and this breakfast comes with a nice serving of hash browns and a nice fresh biscuit with sausage gravy over the biscuit and the steak.  The steak was a decent sized cut of meat and our "over easy" eggs were perfectly fried!  A very nice breakfast and big, too!  We were stuffed and will come back again to try their entree items for lunch or dinner.  This might become our "Go To" Mexican restaurant when we feel like spur of the moment Mexican food.

This time we went for lunch to sample their lunch/dinner entrees.  We are looking for a "go to" Mexican restaurant close to our home that we can frequent whenever the desire for Mexican food hits us.  Today we tried their carne asada and cheese enchilada plate, that comes with rice and beans, and two muffin sized tortilla cups of pico de gallo and guacamole.  It was very good so now we have a new "go to" place!

I guess this review is more associated with LJS corporate offices, but since those morons at corporate provide no way for consumers to contact them, I am using Yelp to voice my frustrations.  My family and I went to this location yesterday and had a bunch of coupons issued by corporate -- preprinted and mailed coupon flyers for discounts and "free" this or that.  I also had a "free" meal coupon issued for my birthday or something.  I was told by the manager at this location that they never honor any of these coupons and there is only store in the entire state of AZ that does (one of the west side of the valley).  Now my question is this:  WTF is the problem with franchises not honoring corporate coupons?  Why does corporate send us coupons if they are worthless?  This make absolutely no sense to me and makes me believe that LJS' corporate management are all idiots! Or.....maybe franchisees are lying about this situation and just not wanting to honor the coupons.

Nothing special.  You gotta be into fried chicken strips and french fries to like this place.  I guess it was an OK meal, but minus one star for serving "edgy" cole slaw.  Both my GF and I had an upset stomach after eating there.

I should have read the Yelp reviews before taking my vehicle in for warranty repairs.  Luckily, since it was only warranty work, I was able to get out of there without any cost or damage.  After dropping my car off, they called and said they found three other problems with my vehicle that need to be fixed -- a faulty radiator cap; a leaking right rear differential seal; and leaking right front axle seal coming out of the trans.  I declined the work and said I would consider addressing the so-called problems later.  So I took my vehicle home and took off the radiator cap and took it to a repair shop for testing....they said nothing was wrong with the radiator cap and it testing out as spec'ed for pressure ratings.  I then put my vehicle up on four ramps that I have, and crawled under it with my creeper.  The rear differential was clean as a whistle with no oil or grease stains on it.  Same thing with both front axles, coming out of the trans as well as the connection to the front wheels.  WTF??? I know that probably more people than not know nothing about cars and have to take the dealer's word for it, but for guys who know a little about cars like me, their bold face lies are atrocious!!!  I will never again do any business with Earnhardt's!!  Contrary to their tagline, "No Bull", they are full of it!!

Just as a test, I called for a recall replacement appt two days ago.  They told me a service writer would call me back to schedule the appointment.  Now it's been 3 days and nobody has called.  Doesn't surprise me, these guys are the pits.  Don't use them unless you like getting screwed and disappointed.

I was just going to let Earnhardt's ride off into the sunset, but the more I thought about it, the more frustrated and angry I got -- I guess I must admit that I am a really anal guy who demands attention to detail and great customer service.  The note posted by one of their management team asking me to call so they can rectify my complaints is stupid -- my complaint is about fraudulently reporting deficiencies with my car that did not exist just so they scam repair dollars from me.  How can he fix that?  It would have been more to the point if he just would say "sorry and we will look into it", or "bring your car in with your deficiency report and we will inspect it again and verify if the report is accurate or not.  If we find that it inaccurately states deficiencies, we will give your repair credits or something".....that would make more sense.    BTW, the service writer still has not called me back to schedule my recall repair.

Tonight S and I had "date night" at a new restaurant in our area.  We did not go into Phoenix for dinner, since it was too far away and it was just the two of us.  So in surfing the internet, I found a place called Rania's Kabob, which is Afghan and Mediterranean food.  It was pretty damn good and very fairly priced.  I had 3 IPAs and S had a wine cooler--all $5 each.  We had a spinach and naan bread appetizer for $6 and S had a combo kabob dinner with rice, salad bar, and Chicken breast and Beef sirloin for $14.  I had lamb chops and rice and salad bar for $16.  All pretty damn good.  We will be back!

I can appreciate the fact that each individual's tastes might be different, or that the restaurant might have an "off" night, but I have been always happy with my meal here.  Last night we went for an early dinner again and we had two drinks/cocktails each, shared a hummus appetizer with naan bread, and two large entrees -- my GF had the steak and chicken breast kabobs with rice, and I had the beef and chicken keemah kabobs with rice.  Of course we also enjoyed their fresh and tasty salad bar, even if it is a small one.  I think I prefer the keemah better than the chunks of chicken breast and steak because I think the seasoning is mixed in well with the ground meat and therefore is tastier.  Wally again was great and accommodating.  He provides great customer service.  If there is a bad server here, I hope I never get him/her because I believe customer service is one of the keys to a good restaurant.  Again, great job Rania's Kabob Grill.

Hey Wally:  We were at your restaurant for lunch again today and as usual, the food and service was great.  Just wanted to say congratulations on winning the restaurant competition last night!  We wanted to attend, but S got home from work at 7 pm and we felt it was too late to go and enjoy your event.

Rania's is now open for breakfast on the weekends!  One of the great breakfasts in the valley!  Where else can you get a filling, tasty, and great Middle Eastern breakfast for only $10?  I had sirloin steak kabob with grilled onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, spinach rice, two eggs and 4 pieces of naan bread?  My girlfriend had the chicken kabob skillet breakfast, but with home style potatoes instead of rice.  You Yelpers should try this place, you won't be sorry!

Boo!  They are not serving breakfast anymore on the weekends.  They had the best breakfasts around!  More comments -- look at all the great reviews this place gets, but their business is slow.  The owner thinks it might be their location or the client who prefer crap places like Ihop and Denny's.  He said he was thinking of moving the restaurant to a location where he would get more traffic.  I hope he does that instead of shutting down.  I would be extremely disappointed if he shut down cause I think this food is great!!

Was craving izakaya type of food so we decided to try this place due to its receiving a lot of good reviews. But we were disappointed for a number of reasons.  When we arrived, we were greeted in a friendly manner and seated right away.  That was nice, but the setting was that of a typical, small teishoku restaurant and not that of the typical izakaya.  No small, low tables with low seats; no low tables with the charcoal grills built into the middle.  I also believe they grill the kushiyaki in the kitchen instead of on the charcoal grills; at least that is what I think because the food has no charcoal flavor.  We were told that they had a big party the previous night and they ran out of most of the beef and chicken types of kushiyaki and did not have any to serve last night --- WTH?  They also had no chicken wings.  That was last night; why didn't the owner/manager make some more immediately this morning?  Pretty lame if you ask me.  We are told we are in luck since it is happy hour time and given a happy hour menu.  Very weak menu -- no "good stuff" on the menu, just routine things.  I order my GF a margarita and she says it is OK, although it looks pretty sad.  I try to order a pitcher of beer, but am told that pitchers are not on happy hour, only glasses.......how sad is that?  I order some food for my GF -- edamane, agedashi tofu, and the chicken katsu dinner.  Those were decent and I have no complaint about those dishes.  I ordered shishamo which were two little skimpy fishes, about the size of a #2 pencil.  I also ordered shishito's which were a nice sized ordered, but drenched in a very salty soy based sauce.  They had no yaki onigiri because nobody was ordering it so they took it off the menu....WTH?  Sacrilege!!!  You got rice -- make a rice ball and grill it on the charcoal grill......oh yeah, maybe there is no charcoal grill.  On the "specials" blackboard they had aji, which is one of my favorites.  So I order one, sashimi style with the bones and head deep fried.  This one dish was pretty expensive @ $14, and I was disappointed.  The fish was not fresh so the sashimi was mushy and off tasting.  However, they did fry the bones nicely. I also order a buta kushiyaki and that too was disappointing.  Not very good or appropriate piece of pork and just grilled with salt -- no sauce or seasoning on the two sticks.  So all-in-all, I was disappointed and will not be back.  I will keep searching for an izakaya in the Phoenix area.

I have always like this place and now this location is finally open.  It opened a week ago and I still love the food!  While the combo plates might be priced a little high for some people, I think it is worth the quality and the quantity of the food.  I had the filet and lamb kabob combo with rice and greek salad.  My GF had the chicken kabob and filet combo with "all salad" as her side.  These combos are $13.99 each, but I think worth the price.  If you like this type of food, I think you will like this place.

This place now closed.  No longer doing business.  Make sure you trade-in your restaurant.com vouchers.

4.5 stars for me.  I agree with what all the other Yelpers have said.  Good service, good food, good prices.  I will go back again and try something different the next time.  Very happy with this place.

I am giving this brand new restaurant 4 stars but perhaps they were only 3 stars the night I ate there.  I am affording them an extra star based upon their potential.  Since I went to "taste test" this new Asian/Fusion Bistro on their second night after opening, there were a few things that need to be fixed up a bit.  The Cal Noodle House is in the California Hotel and Casino, and has replaced the old Pasta Pirate Italian eatery.  It is a Asian/Fusion food restaurant, serving bistro style food.    The night we went we were immediately served a big serving of shrimp chips with sweet chili dipping sauce.  This is their version of chips and salsa that you get at Mexican restaurants.  We also had edamame (pretty simple); ahi poke; Chinese BBQ spare ribs; Korean Kalbi; SE Asian/Chinese chicken salad (which was not exactly Chinese chicken salad and not exactly somen noodle salad, but there were glass noodles at the bottom); blackened ahi; a Vietnamese rice dish with pa'apa'a rice (burnt) and shrimp and oyster sauce over it with a fried egg on top; and some pork egg rolls which were skinny as a boba drink straw, and long about 10 inches.  I can't remember the name of this dish - I was pretty wasted-had approximately six Macallan 18 year old scotch drinks and a bottle of super premium Napa cabernet -which was a bottle of 98 point Katherine Hall.   They also have other menu items such as Mongolian beef (steak style), curries, fried rice, chow fun, chow mein, tom yum soup, won ton soup, etc. etc.  There were a lot of other dishes on the menu which I cannot remember.  You can generally order the offerings as "small plates" or as "large orders".  I think this is nice, if you want to sample a lot of things as small plates.  They have a bunch of desserts too, but we ordered home made macadamia nut and chocolate clusters (candy), lime foam panna cotta, and an order each of strawberry, chocolate, and mango mochi ice cream.  They were all darn good, but there were a lot of other things on the dessert menu too.  The atmosphere is great.  Bright and cheery with an Asian motif.  The wait staff all wear black, with the gals wearing cheong sams and the men wearing Mao suits.  The gals have red chop sticks in their hair while some of the men wore black caps.  I think they looked good.  Lots of Asian accents on the wall or as room decorations.  Pretty snazzy if you ask me!  There are a few things that they need to work out and improve on.  First of all, there is a bar that they share with the Redwood Steak House.  This bar sits smack dab between the two restaurants.  To get to the bar from the Noodle House, you have to go outside and walk around to the Redwood's entrance.  This is stupid since there is a door that the Noodle House's wait staff use to get drinks for their customers.  Even though it is intended to be used by the service personnel, they should let customers walk thru it if they want to get to the bar.  Also, our edamame was lukewarm and should have been hot.  So was our BBQ Chinese ribs.  These ribs also had a strong hoisin flavor, which some might like, but I would have preferred more of a char siu flavor.  And our Asian chicken salad should have had a stronger vinegary and sesame oil dressing, as well as more of it.  While it was OK, the flavor was weak and there was so little dressing, it did not make its way down to the noodles which were on the bottom.  But all-in-all, I thought it was good and will be back again to perhaps sample the other dishes.  Oh yeah, I also was introduced to the #2 man in the Boyd Gaming executive world, who was there to experience the new restaurant too.  The Cal's GM introduced us and he sat down to spend 10 minutes talking with us.  The cool thing here was he was actually at the Borgata hotel and casino the night that gal had the 4 hours and 37 minute craps roll, which is the world's record to date.  The only bad thing is that this women broke Stan Fujitani's old record of 3 hours and 40 minutes, which was accomplished at the Cal here.  He told us all about it and what they did for the players at that table and for that gal.  He said it cost them about $850,000 between expenses and the losses, but he said it generated over $1M in advertising for them.  So for me, it was cool!

Update:  Like I said before, they are still tweaking the menu.  Some tweaks are good, some not-so-good, but improving.  Went for dinner again with my daughter a couple of weeks ago.  Ordered the chicken lettuce cups again -- they are still using the middle of the lettuce head so the cups are small....not good IMO, but the chicken filling is better and more robust.  Daughter ordered the Korean street tacos and those are still excellent.  We both ordered the house noodle salad and that was very very good.  Still using pad thai noodles instead of somen noodles which I think would be better.  But they are now using spring greens in the salad and lots of it!!  And the dressing is way better than before -- this is a winner.  I had the SE Asian oxtails again and they were very good.  Daughter had the Korean kalbi entree and that was OK.  All-in-all, I think they deserve again the 4 star rating.

I was there last Friday night.  Stacy if you see this, contact me and I will give you some needed feedback.  I see where some last few reviews were good, but my meal was pretty bad on Friday.  I spoke with at least 4 other people who were at your property this past weekend and everyone said they would not eat at your Noodle House again -- they all said the food was bad since you changed chefs.  In addition to bad tasting food, your F&B QC is really going downhill fast.  I can give you examples if you want to really hear them.

Found this restaurant today while galavanting with my GF, so we stopped to have lunch.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that this restaurant is an Asian Buffet pretty similar to Pacific Seafood Buffet.  One of the brothers from Pacific Seafood split off and started his own restaurant called Jogoya Buffet.  Prices similar to Pacific Seafood and they also offer senior citizens discounts as well.  Good buffet selection of Asian foods, but my guess is they are still trying to build clientele and as such, even at lunch, they offer a full array of sushi including various nigiri sushi types.  They offer whole, deep-fried, sweet/sour/spicy fish too!  They have a dish on the buffet line that I absolutely love -- Chinese style curry beef stew, where the beef chunks are brisket pieces with the sinew still on the meat!!  This style of beef stew is the traditional Chinese beef stew and I ate a lot of it.  So I think this is a pretty good place to eat, with decent prices, and very close to my home.

Don't know why my "first to review" review does not show as a posting, but does in my profile.  Funny stuff......maybe a software glitch or Yelp is blackballing me????  Oh well, been here twice now and I still think it is a pretty good deal for lunch.  Nigiri sushi is nice and fresh with good quality seafood -- hope it continues and this "plus" is not just an introductory special kind of thing.  Still think that their traditional Chinese beef curry stew is great.  One negative -- the Mongolian BBQ area needs to be improved so the customers have better access and they either need to add more grill cooks or get another one who can move faster than the snail's pace that he works with now.  All-in-all, a pretty good place to have lunch.

Food is average at best.  Most of it is pre-prepared and frozen stuff, but still somewhat acceptable.  My issue is that they either are trying to mislead you, or the owner doesn't understand the promotional strategies that he signed up for.  I use restaurant.com vouchers all the time from restaurants that use their discount vouchers.  So I went a few days ago I had a $15 discount voucher.  My bill total was $30+ so my net cost should have been around $15.  The owner kept telling me that the voucher allowed for a 25% discount.  When I protested, he finally relented and offered a 40% discount.  That was still wrong since 40% of $30 is only $12 so he was shorting me $3!  I will never recommend these guys and I will never return to do business with a crooked establishment.

Pretty disappointing -- slow service and slow food delivery.  Sonoran salad @ $9 was pretty tasteless.  Turkey club with fries were very good.  But my Cajun beef sandwich was also disappointing.  The "beef" was not sliced beef but a burger, and it was was overcooked beyond being overcooked -- dry as the desert and hard as a rock.  To be "Cajun" they sprinkle the burger with Cajun spice which added nothing to the flavor but some spiciness, and the blue cheese sauce was overpowering -- I should have known better and I guess it was my fault for ordering this "beef" sandwich with the blue cheese sauce.  And to top it all off, the blue cheese and the Cajun seasoning were fighting each other for dominance; very conflicting in taste.  Again, the fries were excellent.  Lastly, I used a restaurant.com voucher and I think the server couldn't figure out how these vouchers work -- I think she just estimated the total discount and it was close, but not in my favor by about a buck.....too close to argue about it; I just wanted to get out of there.

Tried this place yesterday.  I was pleased --- food was pretty tasty and of decent quality.  Prices are not cheap; but then again, not atrociously high either.  I bought a variety of entrees --- kalbi, teri-beef, chicken katsu, and BBQ chicken.  All pretty good.  The macaroni salad is OK, but could be better.  The only complaint I have is that they don't have a green salad option as opposed to mac salad.  I also ordered an order of crab puffs for my GF since she likes that stuff -- she said it was pretty good.  So I will be back.  There are not many Hawaiian plate lunch places available for our enjoyment.

We like Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food.  This place is one of the better places to get Persian (Middle Eastern) food.  We went for lunch today and they were busy preparing for a big party that night.  But they were kind enough to accommodate us and serve us.  We began by sharing a big Greek salad that was good.  My GF ordered the chicken breast kabob with rice and pita bread, and I had the gyros plate with rice and pita bread.  I also added a skewer of koobideh for an extra charge.  The food was good and the portions were generous.  We are fans and will be go back again.
