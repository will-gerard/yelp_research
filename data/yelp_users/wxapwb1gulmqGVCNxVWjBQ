Wow. All I can say is wow. I have lived in Scottsdale for a looooooong time and usually when I dislike a place, it's for something like customer service, or overcooking my $35 steak, or a hair in my corn chowder, but this, this was an EXPERIENCE. My best buddy moved back from San Diego this past year and it was her birthday. She loves Mexican food and I had heard about the "great patio" and "delicious margaritas" this place had. It is also next to one of my favorite hotels, the Valley Ho. Well, everything I heard about this place IS true. The margaritas WERE good (better be at over $9 a pop) and the patio is breathtakingly lovely. But OH MY GOD... the food is INEDIBLE, and when I mean INEDIBLE, I mean I swing by McDonald's on the way home for chicken nuggets. THAT inedible. The salsa was so weak I had to ask for hot sauce to basically make it go from tomato paste to some flavor. We ordered a crab dip, and it was just chunks of crab (which I was fairly confident was imitation, but mind you, I was sucking down as many margaritas as I could to mask the horrendous meal I was consuming) and avocados. I didn't even understand it. I ordered mole ribs, and the were inedible. I took two bites, and threw it away when I got to a dumpster. Normally, if it was me just dining alone, or with my fiancee, I would have wigged out, but it was a birthday, for my friend, and in all honesty, our server was top notch. She was so sweet, attentive, and wonderful, and took all of our pictures, and helped us cut the cake and everything. I would have felt bad complaining, ruining a birthday, and frankly, what would I complain about? "Your food tastes flavorless"? "I have had better Mexican food at Del Taco"? I am at a loss at how this place is still in business. It was SLAMMED when we were there. Please, if you want Mexican food in south Scottsdale, go to the Mission. I am embarrassed to say I did not check out what my fellow yelpers would have said about this place, cause I would have steered clear! Dear Tortilla Factory, go to Mexico for a while and learn what a taco tastes like, heck, just save yourself the trip and go to Taco Bell.

Just ate here last night with the in laws and my man for his birthday. Understandably, the the dead of summer in Scottsdale, at 8 pm, the restaurant was dead. Yet, the maitre d and the waitress were MORE than hospitable and treated us like real guests. The restaurant is BEAUTIFUL! A perfect place for a romantic dinner or even an intimate party. It was late, so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the vealm oscar, my mom in law the house special, rack of lamb, my pa in law, the duck l'orange, and my man, the fuits de mer. All of if was sensational. yet, to me, the serivce trumped it all. They even gave us some amazing creme brulee to sing happy birthday with! Definetly going to be frequenting here again!

My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $5 Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too...

Came here a few days ago with some family friends. Mind you, these family friends are from the Mid West and chose this place because they heard it had "really great Mexican food". Next time I let my Windy city friends pick out a "Mexican food" place in the Arizona I have called my home for over a decade, I will think again. So, here we go. I am from Scottsdale, so I pretty much knew where it was. I agree, it isn't very well signed, but when we got there, it as pretty busy. The decor is AMAZING. What a beautiful restaurant. I was tempted to swipe things off the walls they were so gorgeous. Our server was really sweet and fun and because we were a large party, we were sat in the center of the restaurant, right by the bar. We started with drinks, where the ladies had margaritas, which were good, but very small. I like my margaritas in a MARGARITA glass, not a high ball glass. They had an interesting mix of tequila, but they weren't the best, and definitely not the best bang for your buck, for sure. The chips and salsa and guacamole were okay, but very pricey! Most Mexican restaurants GIVE you chips and salsa, for free! And, we were 8 people and they brought us a little basket of chips, which to me, made no sense. My mom and I shared the fajitas for two as our entree. They serve the beef fajitas with beef tenderloin and sausage. My mom and I both thought that was weird, so we asked for no sausage, just the beef. When it came out, our fix-ens' were great, but no rice or beans or even cheese, which is usually served with fajitas. The tortillas were amazing however, and tasted hand made. The peppers were undercooked and there was like NO MEAT in the fajitas... like, none. Maybe, my mom and I had like 5 small pieces each. The fajitas for 2 are $29!!! I didn't make a stink because I didn't recommend the restaurant, and I wasn't paying, I was being taken out. But, in the end, I would never recommend this place to anyone. There are millions of amazing Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale, it isn't worth a trip. In my line of work, I recommend a lot of restaurants to out of towners, and this place will definetly not make the cut. I guess if you want pretty decor and a decent margarita with sub par food, then its your place, but not for me.

Wonderful service, friendly staff, thorough exam. Carries designer frames and the staff is very helpful and fun. Dr. Amy was wonderful. Going to the eye doctor is usually a painful experience to me (I have gone to places like Lens Crafters and America's Best) but I found All About Eyes through my insurance and they are right by my house. Great find, and I am so excited about my new Coach frames!

Didn't feel like cooking Wednesday night, and decided to try this place, which is just around the corner from me. Being from Chicago, it looked like the greasy gyro places I know and love from the windy city. Well, it delivered. I just ordered two gyro sandwiches and turns out the family is from Chicago! Mind you, if you are a Pita Jungle person, this isn't for you. It is more of a "greasy gyro" place, which also sells beef sandwiches, and Chicago style hot dogs. I loved it.

oh so Scottsdale, which is why i love it. Truly the place to take your cousins from the mid west to see their eyes pop out of their skull with the trendy decor, $100,000 cars in the lots, and more plastic surgery than Beverly Hills. Their food is so good it makes me wanna cry. Being a Northie, originally, I used to go to the one in DC Ranch. Now, it is gone. It was so small in there I didn't even care waiting an hour for a squished seat to rub elbows with the cougars. When it moved South, (and I moved to Flagstaff *shutter*) I have been there about 5 or 6 times. AMAZING martinis. Decent beer selection (I like kirin, so no biggie) and the signature sushi is awesome. WARNING: this is not "authentic" sushi, it is trendy, innovative, Scottsdale sushi, but hell is it good. The rock shrimp appetizer is so good my mom and I order 2. The best rolls are: the surf and turf, the mango wango, and the squid viscious. The BEST they ever had was the Spiccoli Roll. They rid of it like a year and a half ago. If I am ever on death row, I will request that as my last meal. It is pricey, but a good place to make your parents take you on your birthday or with your gal pals to share on a Saturday night. I honestly love this place and miss it like, everyday. Best trendy sushi ever. Best rock shrimp. Wait staff is young and trendy and pretty good. Go!!!

This place is very similar to Phil's Grill in Grayhawk, which I have eaten at many times. Came here for dinner, my sis and bro in law live in Trilogy. We sat in the dining room and I was very impressed, the restaurant is beautiful, and the staff was warm and welcoming. Tip: they have 2 menus, a bar menu, and a dining room menu. I liked the bar menu much better, and those prices are very wallet friendly. I am not a big nacho person, but I was blown away by their nachos, and even though we had gotten there way too late, they have a great happy hour menu, with a majority of their items being half off. I have the fish tacos and was very impressed. I also thought the staff was really friendly and helpful, and not too "all over us", our staff understood that we were taking our time, we had a 3 year old with us, and we weren't in any rush. He was very patient and attentive. The ambiance is very nice, not as large as Quill Creek/Phils Grill at Grayhawk, but the decor and ambiance is comparable. I recommend it to anyone who lives in the area. Great local hang out.

Rarely do I get my undies in a bunch over a pizza place, but the food here was amazing. I have never had pizza like this, and I am now a convert.  Went in on a whim and thought it would be more of a take out place, but it is sit down. We ordered raspberry beers, which were delicious, and had appetizers, the wings, which were baked not friend, and stuffed portobello mushrooms, which were outstanding. Super fresh, lots of cheese, and served with a syruppy balsamic dressing. Outstanding. The wings were good, not great. We had mild buffalo sauce (which was waaaay too mild, I would order medium next time) and the Thai sauce wings, which were the best. They were meaty, which was good.  The pizza: Heaven sent. They use molasses in their dough, and the dough reminds almost of a soft pretzel. Awesome. I had the friend egg and pancetta pizza, which blew my mind, and my fiance had a pizza with olives, artichoke hearts, and lots of cheese. Both pizzas blew my mind and all the ingredients were super fresh.  I can see how some reviews don't like the pizza, it is an acquired taste. If you are looking for a traditional pie, don't go there. It is far from traditional. the food was fresh and the service was attentive. Our server was a really nice guy and was super chatty and helpful.  the only thing I don't get is the decor. Like, city modern meets hippie dippy? It is weird. I have heard that the one in Tempe is very eclectic and hippie, which makes more sense. I am guessing they made it more clean, modern, and family friendly at this location, but still, it is confusing. Either way, great pizza, go!

I have been here twice now, and to me, it's for a certain crowd. First time I was here, I sat at the bar and ordered food to go. I had the acai mojito and it was a bit strange. I am a HUGE mojito fan, but it tasted a bit cough-syrup like. I had the strawberry cocktail next, and that one tickled my fancy. I took the pork cubano to go and  it was amazing. Went there last night and it was really great. The pretzels and fondue is to die for, so are the mussells. And, the monket bread is a MUST for dessert. Great food, fun vibe. More of a younger crowd, really adventurous cocktails, so leave gramma at home. Great decor, too.   Oh, and the chairs are insanely comfortable. Gotta love that.

Happy Hour on a Saturday afternoon? Heck, I'm in! Went with a girlfriend of mine this past Saturday and was very impressed. First off, the decor. Wow. Gorgeous. I felt like I was in an episode of "Mad Men". Big center bar, dark moody lighting, and opulent chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Gorgeous.  Now, the food. We just did the Happy hour thing, and it was awesome. We had the Swedish meatballs, which were the perfect balance of sweet and creamy, the chicken lollipops, which I almost had to stop myself from licking the blue cheese from the plate (you can't go wrong with buffalo sauce and blue cheese, its like peanut butter and jelly, meant to be). The chicken had tons of meat on it, which was impressive. I love deviled eggs, they remind me of picnics, and their deviled eggs were amazing, with caviar on top, which wasn't too salty. The icing on the cake were the scallops, just amazing, I think they were grilled, and I love when scallops have that great crunch on the outside, and are buttery and soft on the inside.  My favorite part, they serve Pimms! Which, from what I know when I was in London, their version of like a Mike's Hard Lemonade, a summer drink. Its citrussy and fizzy and amazing. They serve them in adorable little tin cups.  Great place, great service. Great happy hour. I want to hit it up later at night next time. Maybe wear a cocktail dress, so I can feel very "Mad Men".  Enjoy!

Wow... all my millions of times being here, and I have never written a review. Well, I have followed Blu from when it was across from Kierland, to all the way north on Jomax, to now, off of Hayden. I will say I have been a dedicated fan. I love burgers; all shapes, kids, meats, etc. Blu burger is one of my faves. The staff is always chill and friendly, and the place is very low key. I love the California Burger, it is amazing. The buns are always perfectly toasted and they have great fun cocktails that change seasonally. I am obsessed with sweet potato fries, and theirs are a close second to my favorite. They also have a great side salad if you are attempting to be healthy with your burger, and the mango dressing is kick ass. Great food, eat in or even take out. Keep it up Blu burger. I will follow you to the ends of the earth.

There is nothing I love more than a good burger, plain and simple, the way God and America intended it to be, and Five Guys delivers. With the new, trendy "gourmet" burger trend sweeping through Scottsdale, a plain old burger was just what the doctor ordered to get me out of my "goat cheese and grilled pineapple with arugula" burger rut. Went today with a pal during lunch time and holy moley, it was CROWDED! You wonder where everyone in Arizona is in the summer? At Five Guys, sheesh! My pal insisted I order the "little burger"... and even though I told her I was ravenous, she said, "no, you want the LITTLE burger". Expecting a slider sized burger, I was surprised to see it was completely normal sized, maybe even a bit bigged than an In and Out. I was also pleasently surprised because they say their burgers are "well-done and juicy". I myself, like my burgers still moo-ing. Well, I could barely tell they were well done, and Holy Mary, it was the juiciest burger I had ever had! The fries were hot, fresh, and still had the potato skin on, amazing. It is a little on the pricey side. I should have ordered the small fries, but like I said, I was starving, and ordered the big ones. My friend had a hot dog and it looked pretty good. My fave thing: endless topping INCLUDED! Wahooooo! It is definetly a great place to check out, maybe next time I will just get take out, cause it was a bit crowded. I did love the old fashioned feel, with the potato sacks everywhere and the open kitchen with fry cooks chettering away in their crazy kitchen jargon. Being from Chicago, a lot of places have open kitchens and to me, it is a fun thing to watch the interection and the burger flipping. Great place, go, and you will be happy to have a good, plain, old fashioned BURGER!!! NO GOAT CHEESE, YAY!!!

I have been a Phoenician for almost twelve years (yikes!) after growing up in Chicago, IL. In Chicago, I was spoiled by having Greek neighbors who would bring me red eggs at Easter and made me baklava "just because". I have been hoping and praying for good Greek cuisine for TWELVE LONG YEARS. I have been to "My Big Fat Greek Restaurant", and to me, it is comparing an authentic Italian restaurant to well, Olive Garden. The food at Big Fat Greek is edible, but lacks heart and authenticity. After work last week, my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. First off, it is BEAUTIFUL inside. Ornate enough for a wedding, yet casual enough for a friendly get together. Secondly, a majority of the servers are GREEK! It was a Saturday night, and there was a band with a singer, and the lighting was gorgeous, very romantic. We ordered the caviar spread, and the flaming cheese, both amazing. Then, we ordered our entrees. I has a gyros platter and my bf ordered rack of lamb, perfectly cooked. For desert, we shared the Halva. I have had Halva from Kosher delis before, but never like this: drizzled in honey and topped with mint, amazing. I was in seventh heaven. Everything on our plates was better than the next. I took my mom there for lunch today and our server was adorable, so sweet and really chatted with us (I love that in a restaurant, it makes it feel very welcoming). One thing I want to mention: don't let the well dressed staff and overly ornate decor scare you, this place is VERY reasonably priced, with appetizers as little as $5 each, and entrees as low as $10. A rarity in the location, with most restaurants being stuffy and overpriced.Needless to say, I took a stack of "to go" menus, and can't wait to bring my boyfriends' parents, and my gaggle of girlfriends there soon. Keep it up, Athena's, and thank you for warming my heart by bringing Greek cuisine to my neck of the woods!

I must say, that after Eddie Chans left, I had a large, gaping hole in my heart. In hopes that another Asian restaurant would take its place, I was initially disappointed to see another "pizza" place go in... (you know, with ZPizza in the SAME shopping center). But, I really did love the feel of this place, and I came hungry, which was a plus. We ordered the drunk bread appetizer, which, in my personal opinion, was the best thing I ate. Wine, cheese, and bread... if it had chocolate somewhere, it would be a fusion of all my greatest loves. We also ordered the beef carpaccio. This dish left much to be desired. I am not afraid of carpaccio.... give it to me nice and raw.... their carpaccio was well seasoned, but, in my opinion, was a bit overcooked. I had the veggie pizza, and it was very good. Veggies were flavorful and perfectly cooked, and the pizza was good. Good, not GREAT (I am partial to Sauce). Dessert was the berry calzone and I was blown away. Big enough to share, and not too sweet, with nutella instead of chocolate. I loved it. I am however, bummed that I just had a glass of wine here, now reading other reviews about their stellar cocktails. My favorite thing was the feel of this place. I love Postino Wine Bar in Phoenix, but its such a hike, and Local really has that feel. Very neighborhood, great bar, good apps. Service is really good, too. They aren't all over you, and I came with people who I don't often see, so we chat a lot, and he didn't make us feel rushed, which was really nice. I recommend it, especially if you are a local in Grayhawk or Desert Ridge.

This is the perfect yogurt place. It's brand new, and I have been to a few competitors, but this is small, and simple. It also had a bunch of rad toppings like cream puffs, rice mochis, and pomegranate seeds. I had the peanut butter/chocolate mix, it was amazing. Best thing about this place... open til 10 pm on weekdays, 11pm on weekends... FINALLY! A perfect local yogurt place worth a trip.

Okay, so this is a hard one to write since I have experienced the creme de la creme of movie going experiences, which was iPic, at the Scottsdale Quarter, a mere few miles away from Studio Movie Grill. But, alas, Groupon came a knocking and we bought a few cheap tickets and decided to go last night. So, here we go. If I had NEVER been to iPic, i probably would have thought this place was the bees knees, with its sports bar atmosphere, and semi-decent seats, but since I have been spoiled, it is oh-so-hard to compare. iPic does it right. The chairs, the blankets, the swanky menu, the layout of the seats, (where servers aren't darting past you during the movie), and the fact that they serve you all of your food, all at once, no interruptions during the movie.   Studio Movie Grill has sort of an airport experience. You get your ticket, then you line up for your movie, then they like cattle call you when you can "enter". We know when we can enter a movie, thanks. We have all been to a movie in the last century. All you have to do is put the little "Theater is being cleaned" sign out. We get it.  There is a bar outside, which is a nice feature, so you can get liquored up before you get herded like cattle. Yet, they don't give you much direction. Since I had been to iPic, I understood the whole "servers inside the theater" concept, but I am sure many patrons don't, so I urge them to communicate better, as in, "once you are seated a server will greet you and take your order". I think having the bar outside may make people think that they have to only order outside the theater.  Now, the movie theater itself. Yikes, My fiance hit the nail on the head. If you went to a large university like we did, and was subject to lecture hall classes, or "clicker" classes, this is exactly what it felt like. The chairs were office chairs. Yes, black, pleather, uncomfortable, swivel office chairs. I kid you not. And they had red buttons for "service" on them. The buttons didn't bother me too much, the staff was fairly attentive. I wasn't a fan of the layout. iPic is laid out so that your servers never walk in front of you, disrupting your movie. These poor people have to run and duck every 30 seconds. Talk about back aches!   Food- I had an iced tea, my mom had a margarita which I have to say was a heavy pour, which was nice. We got the sliders and they weren't bad, and the fries were delicious. The menu looked like high end sports bar, so pretty much everyone could find something on the menu to enjoy.   Overall, the experience was so-so. If I want to eat and see a movie, I might as well go big or go home and go to iPic.  I figure you can do one of two things: 1. Have a regular movie going experience and go to like a plain old Harkins, or 2. Have an amazing experience, blow some extra dough, do it up style, and see a movie at iPic. Don't settle for second best.
