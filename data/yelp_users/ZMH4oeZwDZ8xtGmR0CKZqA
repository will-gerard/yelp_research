Our eyes couldn't focus quick enough, coming in from the bright Las Vegas sun, into this extremely dark and cool (as in vibe and temp) dive bar off the beaten path, miles off the strip.  38 Special's "Hold on Loosely" was  jamming from the jukebox, locals were seated at the bar and our eyes focused just enough to see the "Please Seat Yourself" sign. We carefully made our way past the 70's-style booths and found a cozy two top.  Before we could sit, a voice echoed from the darkness, I'll be right there. That gave us time to awkwardly gawk and gaze around like the tourist we were. This could be a seedy local refuge for undesirables or one of the best kept secrets in Vegas. We soon found it to be the later.  Our server Nicole came over, bubbly as gas in a hot tub, decorated with a bright smile and oozing with local charm. We felt welcomed, comfortable and wanted to know more. She dropped off two glasses and a bottle of water, no...not Fiji, or Evan...a bottle...with a cork...that had water in it. The bottle may have come from Al Capone's vault. Classic. (and no tad poles).  She gave us the back story of the joint, ex MGM chef from Buffalo cranking out authentic buffalo-style and east coast cuisine with some of the smartest pizza combinations on the planet. Of course we were there for one thing...the Suicide Fries.  Her face lit up, "I love those, we now bottle the Suicide Sauce."  She explained the complex mixture of hot, hotter and hottest all brought together over a plate of fries. We were sold. She also suggested a great local brown ale (maybe from Sin City Brewery, but wasn't sure). The beer and the spicy fries were just what we needed. We were in heaven. The plate had spice, but more importantly, flavor.   Every bite made you want to have another. I worked up quite a sweat and was thankful for the cutlery...you don't want these spices resonating and breeding on your phalanges all day, then touching an unsuspected body part later...  We will definitely be back to try some of the other great sounding items on the menu, enjoy the friendly service and just to see if we can recognize any of America's Most Wanted sitting at the bar.

Flying into McCarran (Las Vegas) airport is always a great time. Everyone is happy, upbeat and they still have plenty of cash stashed throughout their undergarments.  Flying out, a whole different experience. Not because of the long faces, the hung over passengers, the arguing from the recently divorced couple, the aroma of late night cheap booze and cigarette smoke fuming from slept-in clothes, everyone looking like an unmade bed or the oversized souvenir glasses being carried by  every Vegas Virgin.  Naw, that is all part of the experience you love to expect. (as long as they aren't sitting next to you).  I dreaded leaving the airport because the walk to security was long, the lines were never-ending, everyone seems to walk a little slower and four abreast (seemingly unaware of the other 10,000 people scurrying to their gates).  And then, just after passing through security, the need to take a tram to the gate. THe tram which is usually standing room only and having to witness that one passenger who can't squeeze themselves or their luggage into the already full shuttle tram, keeping the tram doors from closing or departing.   Yes, you. Miss, "I smell like cotton candy and squeezed my size 24 body into a size 4 leopard body suit."  But now, today, this glorious of glorious days...all that has vanished. There's a new gate at the airport. And that gate is Gate E. Yes, Gate E, which I assume stands for Extraordinary, Exceptional, Everyone but you Leopard Lady Suit!  Yes, Gate E, my savior. Check-in is a mere "paces" away, a nice quick stroll to the friendly security podium, and no shuttle, tram or people mover in sight. And the quickest TSA agents on the planet, the best must be rewarded and moved to Gate E. My bags, lap top, shoes and belt beat me through the x-ray. I know, right?  And when you get to the gate...There it is Chop House Brewery... Need I say more?

Just like Ty Murray, I found this little "Jewel" on the Northwest side of Las Vegas, just East of Red Rock Casino.   And started thinking when I walked in, "You were meant for me..." (yeah, lousy Jewel reference).  There's a dining room (remember, in Vegas you can still smoke in the bar areas), a bar and a secret loft cigar bar with a fireplace and an outside beer patio. Honestly, being a non-smoker, the air in the bar was fine.  This is an eatery that brews beer, and brew master David Pascual has won numerous awards (well, the beers have) . There's a great assortment, I tried the IPA and the creamy Black Star Stout. The IPA is on the lighter side, a tad hoppy, not too bitter and not over whelming. They offer short mugs, 22oz mugs, the 50oz Brewtus, Pitchers, Growlers and the Brewzooka's (oh my).  You're my boy Blue! Well, maybe not.  I ordered the Black & Blue Sliders. A compact set of three each equipped with a black angus patty dusted with cajun spice, loaded with caramelized onions and a microcosm of blue cheese crumbles.  The caramelized onions were delicious, but extremely over powering. I looked, searched, opened and anticipated a burst of blue cheese, but sadly found just a smidgen, a dot, barely a hint of that penicillin-added mold culture we know as blue cheese.    Just rename the thing the Caramelized Onion Slider, don't tease us with Cajun Spices or Blue Cheese...or better yet, offer a side of Blue Cheese- and for goodness sake, spell it BLEU Cheese.  Friendly service, the bar is loaded with video poker, so sitting at the rail is tough. The high back tables in the bar area are comfortable and it's not too loud, bright or over powering with smoke.

While recently in Vegas, I decided to go back to and try an old love. No, not a strip club or girlfriend, Macayo's Mexican Restaurant.  And just like trying to resurrect an old flame, it fizzled and was extremely disappointing. Sometimes it's just better to remember the good times and move on.  Like love, our tastes change. Like love, one person matures, the other doesn't move forward. Macayo's is just bland. No spice. No atmosphere. Baby, you've lost that loving feeling.  Friendly service? Oh yeah...enthusiastic server? Oh yeah. But now, this place is better suited for those palates who prefer plain. Period.

On a quick trip to Vegas, three of us opted to forgo the $11 half-hearted pours of mixed drinks at the Mirage, and drove to The Summerlin area up North to get some local flavor.  Three Angry Wives Irish Pub caught our eye, just on the name alone. We walked in and it took a few minutes for our eyes to adjust to the dim lit room...which was great. The atmosphere was great.  We forgot about Vegas still allowing smoking in their bars, and there were plenty of smokers and cigar smokers drinking and playing games, but the air system made it very comfortable...in fact, it wasn't really noticeable after a while (great job).  The service was great...very friendly, and energetic. Our server told us it was happy hour and appetizers were 1/2 off. We had to try the chicken nachos...$4.99.  Every head in the place turned as the over-sized mountain of melted mexican munchies were delivered to our table. And the three of us weren't sure if we could finish the foothill-sized plate of flavor...so the back up plan would be to climb them and repel down the other side just to work off the calories.  Even a local diner came over and commented on the huge portion...as she snapped off a picture. They were not only plentiful, but delicious. They should come served with a velvet rope and stanchions to keep the onlookers at bay and crowds of gawkers orderly. A must order!  I can't say enough about the frosty cool beverages, the atmosphere and the service. These nachos will soon be a must-see attraction in Vegas, right up there with the Bellagio Fountains.

Just like the name, this place rocks. When visiting Vegas I would rather drive to Red Rock Casino than the strip any day. Keep up the great service, great prices.  From a Yard House Brew Pub to T Bones Steak House. My new fav.

Great service here. At first you think you are in an Inn and Out Burger, same color scheme, menu is very similar, but these burgers are a distant second. Good, flavorful and cooked to order. Juicy with " you name it toppings" but they can't compare to Inn and Out.  They offer free peanuts  while you wait and they actually post which ranch in Idaho the potatoes for the fries are from.  A word of caution, order the small fries, there are more than you'll ever be able to eat.  Their soda machine has over 100 sodas...seriously, not just root beer but vanilla root beer.
