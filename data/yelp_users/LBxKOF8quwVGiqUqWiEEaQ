I like the G&D.  The food is good, the waitresses are pretty, its a fun atmosphere. I always like the shepards pie but there are lots of tasty things about and some of them are hard to find outside of Britain. (Try the scotch egg if you feel adventurous).

I've been going to the Peppersauce frequently for about a year now and it is always good food.  They have a daily special which is always good.  They generally have pretty decent seating that can handle a group of 6-8 and its easy to get 4 in. The food is maybe best described as trucker food.  The got lots of different hamburger and chicken sandwiches as well as meatloaf, Reuben sandwich and other tasty lunch fair.  The portions are generally huge and just in case you are still hungry, they have some cookies you can buy on the way out.   Like the name of the restaurant implies they have a decent variety of peppersauces on the tables, such as Habenero Tabasco and Cholula. With a meal, a drink and tip you will get out for about $13-14 per person. (Although I am sure you could go cheaper, you really wouldn't get the experience.) They are also great for breakfast.  I generally split their breakfast burrito with a friend because its so large. My 5 star rating represents a "best in class" rating.  Sure there are other places I'd rather go given unlimited time and funds but for a good comfort food meal, this is as good as it gets.

I would have probably rated this place 3 stars or higher in the past, but the place still smells like smoke, years after the statewide no-smoking in restaurants ban.   Lunch dishes tend to be very small.  One piece of fish on a fish and chips, etc.   The wait staff is friendly and there is plenty of seating.

Decent Mexican food.  Easy split checks.  Good for larger lunch groups.

Not the first time I have been here and won't be the last.  Good Chinese food at a good price.  The egg flower soup had a generous portion of chicken in it, making it very much like another order of food and not just an appetizer. The sun kept shining through the window as we at near sunset, so that  was the only detractor of the decor.  In addition to the soup we had the sweet and sour pork, beef broccoli, and teriyaki chicken (mostly 'cause our kids are picky.)  All were good.

Mostly submitting a review just to throw my vote in.  Previous reviews give a good picture of the atmosphere, which is something I enjoy there.  My father wanted a steak and the nearby Texas Roadhouse had an hour wait so we went to Abuelo's.  He was able to get a steak, I was able to get mexican food.  My wife and kids all had something they enjoyed and everyone wins. The spicy salsa (they had two salsa's) is very spicy and even tho I enjoyed the flavor and the burn the spicy salsa brought.  I believe it to be the cause of some heartburn I had later.  Small price to pay.

Good sandwiches.  I like the white widow the best.  Get it with some yellow peppers... yum.

I may be turning into a Chili's fan.  For years, I would have rated Chili's as thoroughly mediocre, with any other nearby restaurant rating higher than what it could bring.   Today I had a mesquite chicken salad sans tortilla chip shreds.  They kept the chips off (which was sort of surprising to me) and it was pretty good tasting.   The server offered to split the checks which is nice and the server who brought out the food brought out the checks at the same time in case we were in a hurry.  My drink was kept filled without me having to ask for it and I think everyone else at the table enjoyed everything they were eating.  We did seem to have to go through a gauntlet of servers, hosts and managers lining the exit on the way out , but overall it was a good experience.

Finally got to go here again for my 2nd time after a long wait from the 1st time.  I enjoy this place, it is very different that almost anywhere else we go both in food and atmosphere.  The lunch special is very affordable and gives you a chance to try 3 different foods.

I hadn't been to RulaBula for a while for lunch thinking it was pretty expensive and while its not cheap, they seem to have organized their menu a bit better for lunch time.  We were able to get in today without a wait even though there was a street fair of some type going on right in front of the place on Mill ave.  I had the special which was an open face pot roast sandwich which was very filling for $9.25.  I have always enjoyed my lunches there and will definitely go again.

Authentic (I guess... what do i know? ) middle eastern food.  Usually pretty crowded at lunch time tho.

I think this is one of the best Japanese/Asian fastfood/rice bowl places in the valley.  I have been going to them for over 10 years when I have worked at various places in the Tempe area.  They have really good rice bowls and a large variety of toppings to put in them, from curry to teriyaki to bulgogi to spicy chicken, chili chicken and good veggies.   I really like the miso soup they have and often order that as a side.   I would like to see a couple of things: a smaller side dish of california rolls, and soup.  On the lunch combos, I'd like to see a bit more flexibility with a choice of entree and two sides rather than a list of set entrees and sides.  Normally this might subtract a star from the "As good as it gets" rating but Tokyo Stop has been consistently good to me for so long that they get the bonus star.  They also get a bonus for taking American Express (they used to not).

I've been eating at the chuck box since first going to college at ASU in 1988.  It was great then and its great now.  I love the burgers grilled on an open flame right in front of you.   I love the elaborate toothpick communications system they have to indicate what meat goes on what bun with what cheese. It seems like they used to have some yellow/ banana peppers on their condiment bar but the last time I was there they only had jalapenos.   I enjoy the Big One with jalapeno jack on a wheat bun.  I get  side of fried mushrooms.   Everything about the place is just about right.  No five stars because they don't take cards - cash only.

After spending time in Germany in the military I have a good desire for German food and this place is as good as it gets.  It is run by the folks who used to own the European Bistro.  More than a bakery, they serve all kinds of delicious German and European food.  Lots of different schnitzels and sausages and of course, real German beer.

Had another delicious meal here again.  I had the schnitzel with creamy mushroom gravy, red cabbage and mashed potatoes.   My wife had the goulash with spaetzel and red cabbage.   This place is kid freindly but doesn't really have a kids menu. Its best if you don't let your kids be picky about new foods.  Our kids had a chef's salad and a bratwurst dinner.  The restaurant is kind of hard to spot from the road but well worth finding it. The restaurant really has a nice atmosphere with the German music playing in the background and nice decorations from Germany.

I really like this place.  They seriously need a bigger restaurant though.  It's so hard to get a group of people over 3 or  more in there.

I'd rate this a 2.5 if it was available.  The restaurant is thoroughly mediocre in my opinion.  They have a fairly boring and standard line up of barbecue, burgers and sandwiches.   The prices are fairly decent compared to many barbecue places but the sauce and cooking is pretty average.  The sides are nothing exciting and some of them (coleslaw) I won't order again. Nothing about this restaurant stands out to me as something to look forward to when it comes up on the lunch rotation. The all you can eat buffet seems like a waste unless you are trying to add to your waist.  You can get plenty to eat for a couple of bucks less by ordering off the menu and the days when they have the buffet, its a madhouse trying to get seated.   The parking is also terrible.

I was able to call these guys just after 7 on a Saturday and drop it off at 8 and pick up by 10 for a wedding.  Pretty happy so far although I haven't gone to the wedding yet..

For a gas station, this place IS as good as it gets.  The gas isn't overly expensive because its next to a freeway or anything and the people inside are friendly and super efficient.  They have a huge selection of food and beverages.  They even include some fruit if you are super health conscious.  I'd like a few more healthy options for grabbing a quick breakfast but none of it is terrible.  Pro-tip, the cashiers work both sides of their registers, move through the line faster by going on either side.

Today we had a very strange experience at the Cafe Roma.  As noted in my first review, we usually go there and expect to be entertained by the silly/bad service.  You know  - ordering the special but getting it 20 minutes after the rest of your table gets their food... because who would expect anyone to order the special?  Having the waiter take your order without writing it down and then coming back to ask for the order again because it wasn't remembered long enough to enter it into the computer.  So you might understand why we thought we were in bizarro world when we came and sat down and upon being asked what the special was, the waitress knew it! Both of them!  Our drinks promptly arrived!  She wrote down our order!  The food came out hot!  She offered to put it on separate checks!  This type of service is not what we expect when going to the Cafe Roma.

At a certain point, the bad service goes from amusing to just intolerably bad.  Taking over an hour to eat at a lunch time place is a no go.   Offering to refill two people's diet Pepsi and then switching the glasses is something we avoided on this particular trip, but has happened in the past.   Really only go here if you aren't on a schedule and don't mind fairly mediocre food.

Like the previous reviewer - i found the pizza to be good tasting and it came with a gigantic salad for the lunch special.   However the service stinks.   We waited a while getting in because there wasn't a hostess at the desk.  She sat us in a nearly empty restaurant (we were there around 11:30am).  She said, "Bread will be right out."   or at least thats what we thought she said.  It turns out she must have said "Brett will be right out." as that was the name of our waiter.  It also turns out (because we asked) that they have a policy of only bringing out bread if you ask for it.  This seems like a stupid policy, if they want to cut costs by not just automatically bringing it out, they could just offer it and the people who don't want it could say no.  Or just take it off of their service all together.  Having some sort of secret handshake to get it just seems odd.  Maybe if we had asked for the free beer, that would have worked... who knows?

Sacks is a nice little sandwich shop that gets a nice semi-fancy sandwich right with out being too full of themselves. They have a decent selection of pre-configured sandwiches without giving too many confusing choices... Each one is unique and not just a change of bread or meat from any of the others.  You order/configure your own sandwich any way you like and they have many unique sandwich ingredients.  Although I didn't have their soup this last time I visted, it has been very good in the past.   I wouldn't try to bring a group of more than 4 to the place, they have seating, but not a lot of it.

I'm generally a big fan of the English/Irish Pub restaurant.  I love the shepards pie and the type of fare that can only be supplied by this type of restaurant.   However the last couple of time's that I have been there, there was just nothing to get excited about.  We recently went for a late lunch there and the food was really just adequate.  They didn't seem to have a lunch special menu like the sister store, Rula Bula does and the shepard's pie just wasn't top of the line.  I went there recently after dinner with a friend who hadn't had dinner.  He enjoyed his steak salad which he commented was the first thing he had enjoyed there in the last several times he had been.  He did have some sort of little bug in his cider tho.  I had a small salad and although it was good they put it on a tiny plate that basically let the greens just drop on to the table.   We were the only table in there on a monday night around 8:00.

I really like Sami's Gyros.  They are a good place to have lunch that is affordable and healthy (if you want).  When I was really focusing on calories I was glad when my lunch companions chose this place because the gyro was relatively low calorie and they have some nice alternatives to fries (dolmas, falafel).   My last trip I had an Italian Sausage with fries and it was very tasty with grilled onions on it.  The fries also were pretty good, crispy and fresh, not greasy.

We found Scott working on a neighbor's yard and we had given up our previous lawn care service a couple of months ago.   He agreed to take our yard for an initial clean up fee and a relatively low monthly fee for bi-weekly service.   Scott came out and did an awesome job on our yard.   He trimmed the front tree and got everything cleaned up great.  Scott told me had previously owned a lawn care business that he had then sold.  He regretted that and now was starting from scratch again.  He did a great job and I would recommend him to anyone.
