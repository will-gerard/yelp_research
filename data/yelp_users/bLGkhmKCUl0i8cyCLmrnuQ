My husband and I got married at the Hermosa Inn in May, and we couldn't have been happier with our experience there. From the service to the grounds, everything was incredible. We only had about 20 guests, and everyone stayed at the Hermosa Inn, making for a really intimate experience. We wanted a venue that felt true to the old west, and one that wasn't cookie cutter--and the Hermosa Inn delivered. Here's what's what:  Grounds: Very lush and colorful, while still having a very distinct desert vibe. Lots of saguaros and other cacti. Impeccably maintained. It made the perfect backdrop for our photos.   Ceremony venue: We got married in the library. Beautiful, with rich, dark wood. Distinct old west vibe, but not in a cheesy way--it felt old west elegant. We only had 20 people, but that room could seat more, maybe 30 or 40, for a ceremony.  Cocktail hour venue: We did cocktails on the library and boardroom patio. It's a nice space that's in an L shape. It has a cute little fireplace (though in May, it was too warm for a fire) and a nice fountain. Perfect size for 20 people. I don't think it could comfortably accommodate more than that.  Reception venue: We used the boardroom for our reception. The table in there is gorgeous--rich, dark wood. It seats 18 or 20 comfortably. It was right off the patio where we had cocktails, which made for a seamless experience for our guests. There's a cute fireplace in the corner.   Food: Incredible! You know how so many couples say crazy things like "Ugh, we were too busy that night to eat" or "we didn't even get to enjoy our dinner at our wedding?" Uh, no. Just no. The food at the Hermosa Inn/Lon's is so good that any bride and groom would be insane to skip out on it. The passed apps we had during cocktail hour were great. For dinner, we started out with the salad with goat cheese, candied walnuts and raspberry dressing, which was nice and light. For dinner, you have quite a few options--filet, filet and shrimp, chicken, veal, etc.--that you'll need to narrow down to two choices in advance. We chose to give our guests a choice between the filet and shrimp and the chicken. I can't speak for the chicken, but the filet and shrimp were delish. I'm hungry just thinking about it now. We had a side of the basil mashed potatoes, which were incredible. Lon's also made the cake, which was great.   Service: Fantastic! Jackie helped us put the entire day together. She talked us through the venues, arranged our tasting, and made sure everything happened on time and exactly as we expected. She was awesome. Our banquet captain was really great, too. He was attentive without being overbearing, and he made sure the entire reception was seamless. Plus, all the other staff we interacted with throughout the entire weekend were fantastic, too. All of our guests had great feedback about the Hermosa Inn's service.   Rooms: My husband and I stayed in a deluxe casita, which was gorgeous. Light, bright and airy. Beautifully renovated bathrooms. Our patio opened up to a semi-private jacuzzi. Some of our other guests stayed in the smaller rancho rooms. They're okay. The bathrooms in those could use an update. They leave a house-made chocolate on your pillow during evening turndown service, which is cute.   Overall ambiance: It's a quiet place, which made it perfect for our intimate wedding. Our guests lounged by the pool all weekend, and seemed to really enjoy it. It's a slow, relaxing environment.   Overall, fantastic experience. While our wedding was small, they do larger weddings as well.

When my husband and I were looking for a place to host our casual rehearsal dinner in May, we knew we wanted to take our small wedding party to one of our favorite local spots. Cibo came to mind, and we discovered their wonderful, private carriage house.   It's located right behind the restaurant, and it's perfect for groups of 30 or less. It's everything you love about Cibo--delicious food, attentive service and cute ambiance. Inside, the Carriage House features exposed brick walls, wine racks, a cool bar and art created by local artists. Outside, there's a private patio with string lighting, cozy seating and a fire pit. Oh, and there's a private bathroom, too.   Michelle at Cibo helped us coordinate the evening, and she was super helpful. We chose a menu that featured an antipasti, a couple of delicious pizzas of our choice, and a sweet nutella crepe for desert. The food, of course, was amazing, and the service was even better. We had a dedicated bartender/server for our group of 20. She was awesome, and made sure our wine glasses were never empty, which was critical for our group of lushes.   The cost was also really reasonable. There was a fee of $50 to reserve the private carriage house, and the cost per person was a steal. The in-laws were hosting the dinner, so I don't know the exact price, but I think the food was around $25-30/pp, excluding beer and wine.   If you're looking for a casual place to hold your next private event, I highly encourage you to check out Cibo's carriage house. So, so awesome.

My two-year-old Boston terrier, Igor, has been a patient of Dr. Roe's his entire life, and it's been great experience.   When I first got Igor, I was a total puppy novice. Prior to our first puppy exam, I had a really, really long list of questions. Dr. Roe patiently and thoroughly answered each of them, and I left that visit feeling very confident about our choice in vets. Since then, Dr. Roe has continued to be fantastic. She's kind and caring, always remembers Igor, asks follow up questions from our last visit, and is always thorough and positive.   During Igor's last annual exam in September, I mentioned that my little guy had become a picky eater. Dr. Roe suggested a couple of ideas--switching his food, cutting down on treats, etc.--and then followed up with us a week later to see how he was doing. I thought that was pretty cool. I don't know about you guys, but my personal primary care physician has never called me to follow up on any concerns I've mentioned during my annual physical, so I thought it was pretty incredible that my vet did! Fast forward a month later, and guess who I got another call from? Dr. Roe, of course, just calling to see how picky little Igor was doing. (He's fine.)  In addition to Dr. Roe being so awesome, the clinic has great hours--they're open weekends and evenings. We've seen a couple of other docs there, and they've all been great.   I've also boarded Igor at their kennel, and that's been a good experience, too. I'm pretty picky about cleanliness, and their kennels seem clean. Compared to other boarding facilities in the area, University offers a generous amount of walks per day, at what I think is a really fair price. I always spring for extra playtimes, because Igor has a lot of small dog energy.   Igor doesn't seem to mind staying there for a couple of days, but he's always happy to come home. They're happy to give you a tour of the boarding facilities if you're considering boarding there, so I encourage you to check them out for yourself.

You guys. I hate giving bad reviews, I really do. My mom always said that if I can't say something nice, I shouldn't say anything at all. But that's not really the point of Yelp, now is it?  Here's the sitch. I had a very small wedding in May, and I heard amazing things about White House, so I decided to go there for my personal flowers for the wedding party. This included bouquets for the ladies and boutonnieres for all the bros.   At my consultation with White House, I brought photos of the succulent bouquets I had in mind, and asked them to recreate the bouquets in the photo. I was VERY clear that they should use the same flowers--even going as far as to provide the name of the succulents I wanted--and the same color palette as featured in the photo. I asked several times if they felt they could do that, and I was assured that they definitely could. I left our meeting feeling completely confident that my expectations would be met.   Fast forward to my wedding day. White House dropped off my personal flowers, and for a moment, I thought there had been a mix-up. Surely they accidentally dropped off the wrong bouquet. The succulents were not the kind I had asked for (by specific plant name) and the colors were totally wrong. Instead of having a bouquet made of chicks and hens in soft minty greens and light lavenders, highlighted by soft peach roses, I received a horrific bouquet that looked like it would have fit right in at a clown's wedding. There was bright purple. There was a weird color green flower that did not complement the ugly bright purple. There were red roses. Let me repeat: red roses.   And, since they dropped off the flowers with the front desk of the hotel only five minutes before we were scheduled for photos, instead of dropping them off with me in my suite, I had no one to voice my concerns to. On my wedding day, I had to do the best I could to fix my bouquet, and that is something no bride should have to deal with.   Now, every time I look at photos from my wedding day, I am reminded of the TERRIBLE job White House did. I'm just glad I didn't have them handle my centerpieces. This place is a disaster.   Oh, it would be unfair if i didn't mention that they did a fine job on the boutonnieres. Those looked exactly like the boutonnieres in the photo I provided.

With a long stint at Neiman Marcus on her resume, I had really high expectations for Jenny. I'm so happy to report that she completely exceeded my lofty expectations. Jenny is just fantastic!  My dress required some major reconstruction. Like adjust the straps, take in the hips, take in the thighs (to make me look like I'm not built like a rectangle), AND shorten the dress. Oh, and I should mention that my dress is all lace, with very intricate beading and crystals. She basically had to take the entire thing apart at the seams, then resew the lace, beading and crystals, then repeat this process to adjust the length. Major work.   When I left my first appointment with her, she assured me that she would make the alterations and return the dress to its original condition. When I picked it up today, I was so happy to find that she delivered on her promise. It was like someone waved a magic wand and shrunk my dress in exactly the right spots (or worked tirelessly to hand sew complicated beading and lace). Her work was flawless, and the fit was perfect.  I really couldn't be happier with Jenny and her craftsmanship. She is professional, timely and joyful. She's passionate about what she does, and very clearly takes pride in doing her job very well. Plus, she's so nice. I left both of my appointments with her feeling so great about my dress. Thanks to her, I know I'll feel great on my wedding day.   Jenny's studio is fantastic, too. It's co-located at her home, and it's professional, cute and very clean. There's a separate entrance on the side of the building, so you never feel like you're walking through a stranger's home. In fact, if you didn't know her studio was at her home, you would think you were in the dressing room of a local store.   If you need your wedding dress altered, you owe it to yourself to visit Jenny. She's just incredible!

Jen Bernhardt did my makeup for my wedding in May, and she totally rocked it. I'm not a huge make up girl. Give me five minutes, some powder and a liquid eyeliner, and I'm usually good to go. So, I was a little apprehensive about having my makeup done professionally. I wanted to look like a better version of myself, not like someone else altogether.   I shared this with Jen during my trial. She asked tons of questions about what I had in mind, floated some ideas by me, and got to work. Forty minutes later, boom--she delivered exactly what I had in mind. I was false-lashed and airbrushed to perfection, without looking dramatic or trampy. Just perfectly natural. Jen's work was awesome! On the day of my wedding, she delivered again, as promised.    Jen is also a total delight to be around. She's fun, engaging and determined to make you look your best. She came to my house for my pre-wedding trial, and showed up on time. On my wedding day, same deal--right on time, which was just one less thing to worry about! I highly recommend Jen--she's fantastic!
