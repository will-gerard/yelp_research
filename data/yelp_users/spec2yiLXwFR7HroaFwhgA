Amazing sandwiches! Stan and his family rock. The menu is not traditional and that is what make this place unique and better! I always get the Tyler but I've  had every sandwich and they all are delicious. Been coming here for 12 years. The place is an old deli and the feeling is very homey!! Give them a try! It's worth it. A Phoenix original!!

Amazing breakfast. Wife and I frequent this place often. At least 2-3 times a week. Breakfast meals with great taste and amazing prizes. The coffee is great. They use a kona blend. I just wished they had a bigger place :)

I'm giving it 4 stars due to the food experienced my wife had... She ate the chicken pasta and it was not that good. I had the 14oz rib eye it was good. However I don't like the fact that it's an a la carte type of place. They only offer a baked potato with the steak and it wasn't even loaded. Needed more sour cream. Each additional side is 5 bucks for a small amount of food. Aside from that my dish was great. I also ordered a caesar salad and it was BOMB!! The steak was very juicy!!

Horrible!!! Disgusting!!! Not clean!!! We arrived expecting to have an amazing burger, however our visit took a different turn. This place is dirty!! Nothing was clean, soda lids were missing, no napkins in dispenser, ketchup was old and bubbly. I will complain directly to the company. Did not enjoy the meal

So my wife and I came here after a fun weekend of letting loose in Scottsdale. We decided on this rest because of the  exposure it got from Guy the host of tripleD. Well, we arrive and it's packed, 15 minute wait. Good sign right? Well no. It was a bad exp.  it took them 15 minutes to get us water and coffee. It took 30 minutes to get our food and 20 minutes to get toast which I ordered in my first order. My wife said her fork and food smelled like a sneeze and the guy sitting next to us sent his food back. He had the hash. I had the country fried steak and it was bland. No salt or nothing. My wife had the omelette and she said it tasted like fake fluffy school cafeteria egg. And it had an M&m in it. A blue one! Wtf. Yea we won't be going back. Oh yea and they charge for refills.   Eater beware!!!

The bomb. Long wait but if you keep you eye on the bar sit there. If it's just a party of 2. Worth the wait. Big portions. Come with an appetite. I ordered 2 bloody Mary's and a screwdriver. Left full and drunk. Great place. $65 for a party of 2.

Great place to visit, it was my 1st time and had no idea of what this food consisted of. We ignorantly asked our waiter (who was great) what to order and how to eat it; he explained it perfectly and expected out rookieness.  Great pace to visit and great enviroment

Bought a gift for my wife over Christmas for a set of eyelash extensions and she fell in love with Joanna. She now goes to her for facials and surprised me with permanent makeup. I was very hesitant in accepting the permanent makeup, but once it healed it looks amazing! As a matter of fact I have also met joanna and now I go to her for my back wax. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars!!

Great work done at North Valley diesel & auto. Brent was very helpful, informative and very honest. He broke down my concerns and concentrated on what needs attention. This is my diesel team going forward! Thanks   I drive an 2004 f350  I have searched for mechanics and I didn't feel to comfortable dropping off my truck with them. With these guys I felt at ease. Honest people great prices

Ted is a SCAM ARTIST! Just like Linda Said. He has taken money from my Business and will not refund the money. I have requested several refunds since Jan 2015 and he has failed to provide the refund. He did Create 1 set of marketing flyers, but failed to deliver the other campaigns we signed up for. He is a very pushy individual and targets people of all income backgrounds for his gain. I also will be taking him to court. He does not respond to emails, and avoids all phone calls. Aside from that business transaction, he also approached me to invest in a Xgames even held in Colorado, Wanted me to invest $10k. When I mentioned that is was out of my comfort level he became much more intense and dropped the price to $1k. That was very weird and definitely proved himself to be a crook. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS MAN!!!
