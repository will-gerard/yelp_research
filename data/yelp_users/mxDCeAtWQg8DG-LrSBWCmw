Avoid this awful nail salon!!  Don't go here for any reason. Ever!!!! Seriously save your $$$ and save the physical and emotional pain you will suffer at the hands of these careless and apathetic people.   My girlfriend had her nails done and it seriously looked like a blind child painted her nails. I sat beside her while she was getting her nails done. So I watched this take place first hand.   She clearly asked the woman who did her mani to be careful not to cut her as her cuticles are very sensitive. This lady smiled and nodded not understanding a word she said... Then she proceeded to cut her several times!! WTF?!?   At the end her nails looked awful. Check out the pics and you'll see what a pathetic job the nail tech did. The people who seemed to run this place didn't seem to care or show any concern.   There are so many nail spots in Scottsdale, don't ever go to this place or you will be sorry.   I hope this place gets shut down it is just plain horrible!!!

After receiving -2- poorly cooked Veal T-Bones, The first I asked for Med-R and it came overcooked and dry nearly burnt, the 2nd attempt was seared Rare as Veal Sashimi... The owner came to my table and began to lecture me on how Veal can't be cooked between the 2 versions that I had been given! In fact the owner was rude, disrespectful, and angry.  He told me that I had no right to send back 2 steaks and that I should leave!    My friend and I completely shocked and speechless stood up and walked out.  I have been to this place a handful of times in the past and always had adequate experiences, but to be treated this way as a customer is disgusting and there is no excuse for this poor behavior.  What I will share with you is this restaurant caters to an older demographic of guests.  There are many regulars who visit this establishment, who are used to average food, below par service, and most likely don't know any better to distinguish from very average to a truly worthwhile dining experience.  The owner waltzes around bragging and telling stories of his past and of Italy... Some people may want to be in this kind of environment, however do not plan on going here if you want privacy as this place is very small and lacks the kind of romantic italian ambiance that one who hope for.    If you are looking for really good food save your time and money.  The food is average at best!  The prices are not some great value either.  The average entree price is just about $18, and apps/salads are each about $9 on avg.  Truthfully there are better places to eat in the valley and there should never an instance where a customer is treated so poorly by an owner.    Close your eyes and imagine seared rear meat-- I have had seared tuna sashimi that was more cooked than the steak that was brought to me.  This is inexcusable and poor execution.  Makes me wonder who they have working in their kitchen.  Pretty disappointing. Epic Fail!

Go for the food!! Seriously this is hands down the best Thai food in all of Scottsdale/Phoenix!! And, YES, I have eaten at nearly every Thai place in the valley...  I have had exceptional service even when the place is packed and extra busy. In fact, I recently went with a friend visiting AZ with a 2-year old child.  The owner went out of his way to make sure the child was happy and occupied with food to keep her happy.  As for the spice issue I just read the review-- not everyone can handle spice and I am often asking for additional chills and peppers to enhance my food, I just know to ask for it THAI HOT now. For those who do not tolerate any spice, I have seen the kitchen send out very mild and wonderfully flavored food for my friends who have sensitive taste buds.  Raves and accolades each time!  Let's just get into the food-- The quality of the ingredients used are always fresh.  I have ordered many dishes on the menu and have made substations that have all be delivered with a smile. The soups are divine, the papaya salad is almost as good as when I was on the beach on Thailand-- BTW, I spent three months in Thailand and have a minor obsession with Thai food...  At first glance the seafood dishes look pricey, but once you try any of the dishes you will taste the quality that you are paying for!  The standards-- Green Curry, Pad Thai, and others are spot on delish! Uncle Som's Pad Ped makes my mouth water for days after... The spicy edamame rocks!! The home made coconut ice cream-- YUMM!  The bar is well stocked, although the wine list is pretty Meh... All the great Thai beers and a few others too.  Here is where you will find a kind, honest, hard working owner who makes the very best and most authentic Thai food in the valley.  If you want the best Thai you must try this place. You will be greatly impressed with the quality of food, preparation, and the taste of each dish you order.   If you really enjoy Thai food and want a high quality food experience this is your spot!  Since you will be back many times after you try, I look forward to meeting you at this amazing Thai place.

2.5-Stars is more than fair! But I am rounding down for this place.   Had a night here and at first glance it's a pretty good looking place to stay. The decor is fresh, modern, and very tasteful.   Kinda like a desert mirage it was all just in my imagination...  The check-in experience was very disappointing as they seemed confused on just about everything and how to process our stay. One manager was on a call with an angry guest-- that was clue #1.   Besides the to be expected rank odor of stale cigarettes throughout the place, what I noticed almost immediately was the low grade materials and workmanship everywhere!!!   The paper-thin walls are no joke! You can hear everything near, above, and below. Every voice, cough, grunt, and sound will be magnified in all directions.   Then if you turn the A\C on in the room it will sound much like a freight train passing by...  While I am grateful there was a mattress cover on the bed, it felt like a heavy weight plastic bag used in a geriatric facility. Nothing like rolling over on plastic.   Loved the style of the bathroom just wish the water pressure matched the strength of the design.   Here's what I would leave you to consider-- it's cheap and fairly nice, just not as nice as it looks!! If you go to a Motel 6, you know exactly what to expect, however when you come here you may be dissatisfied once you realize everything you see is just too good to be true!   If you're drunk and exhausted, you won't even notice the noise or cheap construction...  Stay at your own risk, just beware every sound and noise you make will be heard and noted by all of your neighbors.

This must be the worst staffed restaurant in all of Arizona when it comes to service and customer service. The D in D-bag stands for disgusting!! I've had better service at a food cart on the street. This place should be ashamed of the poor service and lack of professional service.   The food is decent, but all the best food tastes pale when the server is awful.   It's like a really pretty girl who has the heart of stone. Beauty and taste are only skin deep and when it comes to food there are too many good choices to waste your time or money on this foul establishment.   Seriously if you care about service and being treated well where you eat and spend your money do not ever support this business. They do no deserve our money or reservations.

Seriously you do not need to wait 1 hour after being seated to have breakfast delivered.   While this place is very charming, it is understaffed and the wait is outrageous for service and food.   After arriving at almost noon on a Saturday 11/9/13, we waiting 20 mins for a table, which in itself is more than reasonable for a table. The service took a while to greet us and eventually we were given menus and ordered breakfast.   Now we waited another 20 mins after ordering and the server who was friendly asked if we needed anything. Yes, food! She went to check on our order and came back and said it would be another 40, yes FORTY MINS for our simple breakfast order to arrive.   Shame on you for making customers wait over an hour to eat. This was not shared before sitting down! I overheard other customers also discussing long waits.   Do not go to this restaurant if you're looking for a quick or even timely meal and do not expect much from the service either.

I love Silver and Sage Jewelry!   Do you love pretty things? Do you appreciate beautiful stones and wearable art? Do you want to add grace and power to your life?   I do and I am proud to share my experiences as a customer and the many incredible benefits of owning, wearing, and gifting the magnificent Malas, bracelets, earrings, and other fine pieces found at Silver and Sage...  Truth be told I discovered these Malas in the yoga community, however the power and benefits to wearing these powerful stones extends far beyond yoga, or any imaginable boundary.   There's not a day that goes by that I don't have Malas paired with my suit, clothing, workout apparel, and in my life. It may sound far fetched, but when I wear these stones around my wrist or neck, I feel empowered, protected, invigorated, and ready to challenge all fears, insecurities, and limits to my dreams & goals.   Yes, I am a man who wears Silver and Sage Malas everyday! My girlfriend and I both love our collection of stones and proudly display the strands in the actions of our lives. While she rocks her stones in her fancy pants boardrooms high atop the corporate America ladder, I can be seen in my stones shooting concerts and rising artists throughout Denver's incredible music and fashion scene.   When you meet Logan, Tristan, and Mary you will know you're at home with these remarkable souls who will guide you through their magical creations.  Allow them to share the stories of the stones and the many powers that can be unleashed throughout your life while wearing these gorgeous stones.   As you step into the truly enchanted space, which is a hacienda home converted into this art filled retail space you will be instantly transported into a calm meditative sanctuary much greater than any shopping experience you will ever imagine. The fine selection of stones, and beautiful jewelry is only outdone by the quality of the work and the service provided to you as a guest as your begin to adorn yourself with these life changing pieces.    To the men out there-- these gifts will make the women/people in your life feel loved and cared for like no other gift you will ever share.   To the women out there-- these stones will leave you grinning ear to ear and could become habit forming!!   To all people out there-- wearing these Malas could induce deep happiness, fearlessness, and the ability to manifest your wildest dreams.    I love to share my personal experiences wearing these Malas and I am excited to share Silver and Sage with everyone I meet and know. You're going to fall in love again and again...

Desert Sage Seminars is fantastic!!!   First off, it's an easy to use site that makes logging on and navigating through courses a breeze.    The online courses are interesting, informative, and relevant.   The owners are local and are truly committed to the success of agents in our area. They are also very nice people.   Compared to other sites the fees are competitive. However the ease of use and flexibility has no rivals. If you want to be able to move at your own pace while maintaining your other important daily responsibilities this course makes it possible.   I found the courses flew by with very user friendly quizzes and the final exam for each sections uses the same material.   If you need to renew hours and you're considering other options, I highly recommend using Desert Sage. I will be returning anytime I need CE hours!   This is a great program and I am going to let every agent I know...

This place is special, and like no other barber shop or hair cut place you will find in AZ!   10 years ago I stumbled into to meet Boris and his father Eddie after a month long ski trip with an unruly beard and a desperate need for a hair cut before returning to work. This fateful day led to a long interesting journey of hair cuts, shaves, referrals, and many deep belly laughs that can only be described as priceless.   Let me warn you that Boris and the Shaving Grace staff are usually PG-13, and often times NC-17 with their humor and take no shit attitude. Insults and compliments are dished out like candy and no matter how hilarious the verbal jousting gets, you are 100% guaranteed to leave with a precision cut and fully satisfied with your shave and hair-do.   These guys are multi-generation Russian Jews that take the art or barbering seriously and their passion and pride in cutting hair is a devout practice. Make no mistake when you enter the shop you have stepped into their domain and they will treat you to the finest hair cut and shave offered in all of ARIZONA. Just enter with respect, a wicked sense of humor, and some humility.   I now live in Denver and travel to the Phoenix area about every other month-- when I get into town, the first trip I make is to see Boris! You really can't get a cut this good or a laugh this hard anywhere else!!   When you become a regular client these guys will bend over backwards to keep your business and will treat you like royalty. Doesn't mean they won't make fun of you at times, but like children teasing the boy/girl they like most with juvenile pranks, Boris and crew will openly tease and harass their most favorite customers. So if you're lucky enough to be harassed take it as a grand compliment and know you've made it into the "inner-circle" of clientele.   In all seriousness Boris and crew can take it as well as they dish it, but we as the customer get the greatest cut, an enjoyable time at an old world barber shop, and the ability to just be real/honest/raw in a safe and politically in-correct environment that will keep you coming back for years to come.   Shaving Grace cares about how you look. They will go out of their way to make you look as feel your very best. All ages, sexes, and hair styles are welcomed. I would recommend making an appointment, but they will accommodate walk-ins as well. And in case my review has made you weary, this shop has respect and manners when women and children are present, they-- definitely tone it all done. And truly most of the time all you can hear is the buzz of the well oiled clippers and the annoying sounds of Fox News on the TV. I ask to get a game on. Even if it's pool or cricket just so I don't have to hear the Fox News idiots for my entire cut...  If you're overpaying some hot Scottsdale stylist just because you like the feel of her huge plastic boobs rubbing up against your head and shoulders-- STOP!!! Get over to see the crew at Shaving Grace ASAP. You'll get a better cut, save some $$$, and leave with the confidence to get any hot babe you desire.   I am a fan and you'll be be too!! Give Boris a call and get him to put you on the books for your next cut. You'll be glad you did.

This is Italia Pizza heaven. (PERIOD)  Watch them make your perfectly cooked thin crust masterpiece right in front of your eyes.  The brick oven is the centerpiece of the new location.  The outdoor patio is great, lots of bar seating in and outdoors.  The main dining room fills up so make a reservation-- and if you are last minute just sit up at the Pizza bar and literally observe the pizza making operation.  The food is just GOOD!  The salads are HUGE and should be shared.  The pizzas are pretty much good for one unless you are sharing a salad.    There's no need to waste calories anywhere else. Pomo is dishing out the very best Pizza in town.    The wine list is sufficient with plenty of drinkable options at good prices.  Back to the Pizza-- the ingredients are simple, fresh, flavorful, and leaves you wanting more.  The dough is perfect and you will be fighting over the last piece of crust, especially with the red flake chili oil they offer.  If you have a sweet tooth, their deserts are top-notch. Without question the best Tiramisu in all of Arizona!!!  When you are craving pizza nothing is going to beat Pomo for a real Italia experience.   This is yummmmmm!

WORST SERVICE IN TEMPE!!!!! Like the WORST....  Highly understaffed and rude to boot.  First off all you'd have to be drunk to enjoy the awful food and since we are having trouble even ordering a drink it's just a miserable experience.   I won't ever be returning to El Hefe for any reason. Even if they were giving away Tequila for free, I'd find another spot to drink.   Clearly they make lots of money and the management doesn't care for their customers.   In a town full of bars there's lots of other good choices to drink and spend your $$$  Don't go to El Hefe!!!

Sometimes in life all we need is a 2nd chance to make it right!   Visited El Hefe this past weekend and had a great experience. Service was top notch, food came out quickly, and the drinks certainly were the highlights.   If you noticed my prior review, I am pleased to share the entire staff, management, and everyone we encountered was polite, friendly, and very accommodating.   Jessica served us and she was a delight! Very attentive and made our experience really sweet.   Guys-- the eye candy at El Hefe is reason enough to go... And if you're planning on bringing your lady, just keep your eyes glued on your date so you don't get in trouble drooling... Because this place may be one of the best places to watch any game, fight, or match on their huge and many TVs.   The selection of tequila & beer should meet any preferences or demands. We drank Casa Noble and had a delish margarita. Very good!!!   The food is a big step up from typical bar food, but don't expect authentic Mexican cuisine. They offer a great selection of tacos and snacks to pair your appetite for drinks. We loved the macho nachos and there's no way 2 people can eat all those chips piled high with all that yummy cheesy goodness. For a sun night out or to watch any exciting game, you will enjoy the snacks and the killer drink selection.   Coming back a second time, I made sure to seek out the management crew and shared my thoughts about my experiences. My biggest advice is seek out Rob, Erik, or Jamie if anything is either really good or really bad-- these guys truly care about the customer experience, and are striving to make El Hefe remarkable.   While I had my doubts, I am a fan and will be back during my visits to AZ!   Cheers...

Jade Palace Pinnacle Peak is a Masterpiece!  This is the finest Chinese restaurant in all of Arizona and one of the best spots in all of North Scottsdale.  The new location is gorgeous, stylish, elegant, and just plain wonderful.  Jade Palace has been around in the Valley for many years and it continues to improve in every possible way. I have experienced fantastic service and really enjoy so many of the friendly and engaging members of the wait staff.  Whenever possible ask for Karen shes awesome.  I began eating at Jade about 6 years ago and used to frequent the Shea location, until I discovered Devlan, Hugh, and their exceptional staff.  The Mei family is kind, friendly, and all about providing an enjoyable and fun dining experience. This kind of family run, high-end restaurant is seldom seen anymore, especially in Scottsdale.  The 5-Star experience can easily be shared by all with few simple tips...  -Make a reservation.  -Ask for Hugh Mei, he is the general manager and truly the best possible guide for a delish and lovely experience. Hugh will help insure that your service is excellent.  -Try new dishes and be open to suggestions, especially with the wonderful seafood specialties. Jade has some really incredible dishes!  And the best possible suggestion to understand the culture of Jade Palace is to prepare yourself and your party for a true dining experience of 1.5+ hours. They also have a wonderful bar culture of regular patrons who dine at the bar, share stories, and relax over great cocktails/wine, and custom made dishes never found on any menu.  The Mei family loves to eat, drink, and share family time.  This is exactly how they run Jade Palace, as an extension of their friends/family.  The true Chinese experience is had family style, sharing many dishes, pouring wine, enjoying laughter, and savoring each amazing bite and taste.    Jade often gets very busy, especially on the weekends and holidays. So plan accordingly and allow for extra time to sit, enjoy, relax, and have a wonderful experience.  There are so many must, do not miss dishes on the menu so I will share a couple of my faves and then you can explore on your own.  The NY style Egg Rolls are delish, and the BBQ Spare Ribs are Amazeballs!! The Sizzling Rice soup is bomb.com... I am a huge fan of the House Chow Fun. The Seabass is out of this world, and they cook the Filet Mignon to perfection, all of the chicken dishes come out tender and delish. One of my most favorite dishes is the Imperial Duck!!!! It is unreal good, dripping with flavor, crispy on the edges, lean, and yummm-yummm good! My last tip on found is the Green Bean side dish-- just ask for it Hugh style and be prepared to slurp up every single bean on your plate.  Jade's menu always includes seasonal specialties such as Lobster, uniquely prepared vegetables, and often some unreal Roasted Chicken dishes!  Be prepared to spend a few dollars, share lots of great food, and sip on some really great wine.  Oh and the Dirty Blue-Cheese Olive Martini is the best in all of Scottsdale...  In case you can't make it this far North, try the Jade Shea location just off the 101 and Shea.  Truthfully the food may be slightly better by way of the longer seasoned cookware, but by no way much different. The wine won't be nearly as exceptional, but you will enjoy Shea Jade and it's a great place to order Take-Out.  I am a big fan of Jade Palace and you will be as well.  For a quick and delish option-- order Take-Out and pick up your food.  Their take out is awesome and you will have a great time eating their tasty dishes at your own comfy place.  Hopefully I will see you at their bar soon!
