I'm not sure why this says closed, but I'm pretty sure they're still in business.  Maybe their reviews were closed because they were bad.  I don't write bad reviews much, but I had the worst experience of my life at this place.  The owner is the rudest lady I've ever met and I really don't know how they manage to stay in business providing the type of dishonest service that they do.  I had been warned about the bad service before I went there, but did anyways and totally regret it.  I remember this business and the single worst buying decision of my wedding and if there is anything I could have changed about my entire wedding and the planning process it would have been ever walking into this store.

by far one of my favorite restaurants.  I'm totally in love with the biretta.  The best thing is to find a friend and share a salad and  brochette flight at lunch!   I took my husband once and he didn't think it was enough food to fill him up (he went home and ate more).... but for me I'm always happy and stuffed when i leave.

Very impressed with the service her.  I got laser in 3 areas back in 2002  when Laser for Less was relativily new.  After 9 years I decided I wanted to get touchups done.  I called thinking there was no way they'd still even have my records or say that  I wouldn't qualify fo the 1/2 off for touch ups after 9 years but had absolutely no problem.  They found my records in a second booked for for my 1/2 price touch ups.  I went in and had Yancy  (who did my orginal treatments 9 years ago & is still working there) and an overall delightful experience.  I highly recommend Laser for Less!

Went to Furio for Martini & Manicures on a Monday night.  Awesome concept and great hook price.  I honestly loved it and will totally go back again for the event.  A couple of things to keep in mind before going: 1... you need to plan to spend the entire night there.  You just don't walk in and get a martini while having a manicure and walk out, you sit down and get a number and wait for the manicure (we waited about 2 hours).   2...  plan on having dinner.  They have a reasonable dinner menu special for Monday night and it's good to pass the time while waiting for the manicure (and to sober you up while drinking the martini's).  3... Bring a couple of singles for tip for the manicure.   Definitely would recommend the event to anyone looking for a fun girls night out on a Monday!!

I moved literally walking distance from Thai Pan about 9 months ago and finally just got take out from there for the first time last night and thought it was great.  My husband wasn't in love with his dish, but our app & my dish (the peanut noodles... yummy) were excellent.  Definitely going back and would recommend.

I go to the Deer Valley location & was referred here by 3 different people.  I love it here.  Everyone is so nice, caring & we always have a great experience.  I love close but would gladly make the drive to go here if I needed to!

Love this place!  It's almost walkable from my house, but definitely my favorite place to go in my area.  I've been here 3 times now and have had great food every time.  Their steak fries are to die for!  Can't wait to go for St. Patty's Day!

If I could give 0 stars, I would! I have had the WORST buying experience here. In May 2008 I purchased a dishwasher, stove, & microwave from Spencers and my experience was OK so I went back to buy more appliances when I moved. I purchased a Washing Machine, Dryer, & 50" Plasma TV. They first tried switching the TV at delivery to a model that was $600 cheaper. When we said they gave us the wrong model they said that the TV they sent was a replacement because they sold all of the model we purchased and couldn't get anymore. After 2 weeks we still didn't have a new TV and they would only offer to switch us to a model $600 cheaper. It wasn't until after we called for the owner and submitted a report on Rip Off Report that the TV we originally purchased magically appeared at one of their locations. The Washing Machine had some issues from day 1, but ran. After 1 month of use the front loading washer completely stopped working. Now a week and half later we've had the service company out twice and it's still not working and we're being told that we will be without a washing machine for weeks. How is a person supposed to go a month without a washing machine?! It's 1 month old and needs 2 new motherboards. After the experience I had with the TV I wouldn't be surprised if I received a refurbished washer or something. Don't be lured by their cheaper prices. We bought so much there to save some money on the deals they offer, but learned they offer the deals because they screw you after the fact. Don't be like me and read the bad reviews and shop there anyways because of their prices, trust me... it's not worth the inferior quality or service you receive and they lies they tell are out of control!

I would like to thank Divine Skin Spa for executing the deal vouchers they sell (Groupon/Doozy of a Deal etc.) they way they should be.   I'd just about given up on buying deals for service realated things like massages, hair services, nail services, etc after numerous bad experineces of getting put with bad staff.  I'm someone who trys a place off of a deal and could easily become a customer but with most places have been turned off after receiving poor service.  I had a business I had bought a Doozy of a Deal voucher to close & I had a credit to use so I decided to put it to a voucher for a massage & facial at Divine skin spa.  This is a place that isn't extremely close to my house but I will drive back to go there again because I had a great experience.  The purpose of the deal worked... you just gained a client that had never heard of your spa before seeing it on the Doozy of a Deal site.    I had Rayelle for my massage & Carley for my facial and loved both of them.  I will definitely be returning for another Rayelle massage very soon!! Everyone was very nice and their online booking system & email appointment reminders are very easy.

I took my car into Discover Hyundai for service and had the best experience.  I worked with Tim in the service department who was so helpful and determined to fix my vehicle. He kept me informed with what was going on with my car and had better communication than any car service advisor I've ever worked with. It was more like working with a friend. I will definitely be going back next time I need to take my car in.

I've been here 3 times now.  The first 2 times were off of deals like Groupon & Living Social & the last time I just went & paid full price.  It's right next to my house & I have a baby so it's convenient & easy for me to go to and not be gone from home for very long.  If it didn't have the convenience factor I probably wouldn't go out of my way to go here, however it is a good option if you live close.  I've always been offered water & the ipad magazines and my blowouts have been decent to good.  I would definitely do another blowout here, however probalby not makeup.  I've had makeup done twice now and wasn't a fan either time.  The last time was for a major holiday party & I where my eyeshadow looked pretty, they didn't put on any eyeliner & after a few people told me it didn't look like I have much makeup on I finally added eyeliner & eyeshaow.  The time my hair looked the best (this last time for the holiday party), I spent an extra $10 to add on the Hot Tools add-on which was well worth it because after the blowup they'll curl your hair with a curling iron and it did look great. I'd overall give it a 3-4 stars.  I will go back again if I have a wedding or somewhere to go as an excuse to get a blow out & hopefully one of these days they'll wow me with something amazing!

I've been to Primp & Blow (North Scottsdale) probably over a dozen times now and am standing firm at about a 3.5 star rating.  I love getting a blow out and they are right next to my house and so convenient.  My hair always looks great after wich is all I can ask for.  If it weren't for occasional attitudes I've gotten here and there I'd probably be giving a 5 star review.   I had an issue 2 times ago where I had a deal chicken I had bought just 2 days before (and clearly not used yet) but since she wasn't finding it on her end (even with my voucher and clearly no appointments since I had bought it).  The front desk girl was very rude and insisted she hold a credit card to charge if they didn't 'find' my deal chicken on their end with the only answer for me who had paid for the deal chicken being to check my Credit Card statement and if they charged me then call & take it up with Deal Chicken.  Sorry, but in my opinion that's something they should have been doing as I clearly had paid for the deal chicken and never used it.  So that's where I dock them some stars is the customer service area. Last time I went I got a complimentary blow out with a new stylist in training so you absolutely can't beat that.  5 star on that experience!   It's honestly a different experience every time I go, but I will continue to keep going as the end result is great hair (and sometimes great makeup) which is what I am going for!

Had a great lunch there yesterday.  As far as pizza goes. I typically love there's however tried the white pizza yesterday & didn't love it (it was just OK).  But our waitress was great.  We had Katie & she was very personable, very on top of everything and we had a delightful new years eve late lunch out on the patio.  I will go back to this location over others solely based off of the great service we had.

WORST restaurant experience I've EVER had!  I was so excited to try this place since it's walking distance from my house & owned by Heart & Soul Café (which I really enjoy).  This restaurant is going to give Heart & Soul a bad reputation if they keep doing business they way they are now.    We went this morning with friends that were visiting and about to leave town.  The waitress wasn't very attentive which would have been fine if we would have ever gotten our food.  We ordered right away since we had 2 infants with us & our company wanted to get on the road.  We waited 1hour 15 minutes for our food (which we never received).  After about 30 minutes the waitress completely stopped coming by our table so we had no idea what was taking so long.  We all had empty drinks & never got a coffee refill or anything.  We finally tracked her down to ask what was taking so long & was told the kitchen just received a bunch of tickets at once & was backed up but all of the food was starting to come up.  There were only 4 of us, but for whatever reason tables of 2 were coming after us & getting their food.  I had a direct view into the kitchen & they were SO disorganized.  The kitchen staff was fighting & yelling at each other (loud enough to hear in dining room) & wait staff was going in yelling at them. It was very unprofessional because it was all in view of our table & we were listening to their fighting the whole time we were sitting there.  We finally decided after 1 hour 15 minutes & absolutely no communication or service from our waitress that we had to leave.  The babies (who were being angels) were starting to get restless & our friends were past when they needed to be on the road home.  When we told our waitress we were leaving she just said sorry then walked into the kitchen & yelled 'don't make the food for table 30'.  So after all this time we receive nothing but the word 'sorry' & find out that they STILL hadn't even made our food.  The restaurant was not near busy enough to even begin to make an excuse for having not even made breakfast that had been ordered over an hour before.  Then the fact that nothing was even said to try and make things right when we left.  I will be very surprised if this place is in business long. They had an opportunity to be a great neighborhood breakfast place & I would have loved for it to be but I will never go back here after the poor service we received on so many levels.

Seriously amazing dinner tonight for the Wine Club! Strawberry Spinach Salad, Pheasant for dinner (yummy) & the most amazing Bread Pudding for dessert! I can't drink tonight but everyone had a 100 point wine plus a $500 wine & $1000 wine & said they were awesome!

My husband and I went to Rick Bronson's House of Comedy for the first time on Valentines Day and had an amazing time!  We were lucky enough to have Rick Bronson hosting the night and he was hilarious, the perfect way to start and end the show!  I personally wasn't a fan of the 2 opening acts but Jen Kober was the main act and she was great! Jen Kober & Rick Bronson definitely made the night great.   We didn't try any of the food but I had a few glasses of wine and water and our waitress was great- very attentive. It was a great date night and way to spend Valentines Day, we will definitely be returning!
