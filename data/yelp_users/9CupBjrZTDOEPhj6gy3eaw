Can't say enough about this place!!  They don't just fix the injury in question, they help to repair and strengthen all of the areas that were effected by the original injury. They believe in the whole body approach and work with you and your pain level. Yes, they push you but not at the expense of your health. Having been to a number of therapists they are by far the best!!

If you like blue cheese burgers look no further.  This place has the best in the valley hands down!!  It can get a little crowded on the weekends but the wait is worth it.  Staff is always friendly and attentive.

Everyone raved about this place...save yourself the trip honestly.  I've been here for dinner and brunch both were meh at best.    Had the chicken picatta (sp?) honestly it tasted like they poured the whole bottle of wine onto my plate.  The crack bread everyone raves about is a disgusting oily mess.  Brunch was over priced for what you get.  Waiter needed to be flagged down several times for refills (we were a party of 8).  The only other people in the place were friends of the owners (party of 6).  The owners kept shooting us dirty looks when we would give the waiter a heads up that something was out at the buffet (they put out the bare minimum).  We had called days ahead to make a reservation and told them that we were coming in for brunch with a party of 8.

Love this place. Staff is always friendly and service is fast.  Outside patio isn't much to look at but it's in the shade which is always nice in the heat

Not worth the hype.  They hand you menus as soon as you put your name in, as soon as you rear end hits the chair the waitstaff is demanding your order.  After your food has been served you practically have to jump up and down to get any attention.  Food was mediocre at best  and luke warm by the time it got to us.  Not one of the 3 would ever go back

This place is amazing!!  Best pizza in town!  Staff is super friendly and food comes out fast.  Owner is fantastic and makes sure everyone is happy.  Cannot say enough about this place.  Take-out is just as good as when I'm at the restaurant.
