Wowza, what a mac and cheese! I really enjoy everything about the Greene House.  Walking into the restaurant, the atmosphere reminds me of a California beachside restaurant you would see in Newport Beach. The fare is light and full of flavor. I always enjoy the salad options and the steak salad is no exception... it is truly flavorful. Just the salad would be too healthy for me though, I like to take a friend and split the mac and cheese with it also. Although I can never get a straight answer of all of the cheeses that comprise this little bowl of wonder, it doesn't matter, it is delicious. Topped with homemade croutons, the mac and cheese can't be missed. While you are visiting, make sure you look at their specialty drinks... the raspberry lemonade vodka drink is delicious on a hot summer day.

Who doesn't want to watch the Coyotes practice when working out? That's what I call some inspiration. Mountainside Fitness truly is my place to go and sweat. The people are nothing short of welcoming and who doesn't love their own personal tv on their cardio equipment? (Finally I can watch something other than ESPN!) Forget your ipod? No worries, the playlist on the overhead is always good, and the equipment is always clean and working. It's a nice change from the 24 hour fitness' chaos. Only concern is that there can be a lot of personal training sessions going on in the late morning hours. I would say go early morning for your pick of anything, or late afternoon. Trust me, this is a gym you will love. (and it's at a price that is much more affordable than some other luxury gyms in the area). Go get your stair-thrower on!

A little bit of goodness right around the corner, literally. Whenever I am having a bit of a craving for some down home tasty goodness (like my favorite grilled cheese in town), I head to Chloe's Corner. The American Grilled Cheese is ah-mazing and should not be missed. I like to order and sit at the counter for lunch. Partner that grilled cheese with a bowl of their fantastic tomato soup and you have a bit of heaven on your lips. When you walk into Chloe's Counter, you are immediately greeted by a barrage of wines, old time candy jars, and 'small town' restaurant feel. I love this place for so many reasons, but one thing you MUST not pass up (aside from the American Grilled Cheese) is the malt milkshake, trust me chock up the extra 50 cents for the malt, it is so worth it! Dare I say one of the best chocolate milkshakes in town? I think so.

It isn't often I opt for a grocer for lunch, but AJ's is a great little place for a quick bite. Whether you are in the mood for some spicy orange chicken, a handmade 'deli style' sandwich and pickle, or some poached salmon, AJ's has a little something for everyone. During the weekdays they also do an outdoor BBQ with pulled pork sandwiches and tasty grilled burgers of goodness.  The real treat about AJ's - you can do all this and still pick up some of your specialty grocery items. The floral section of AJ's has some great picks that would make any dining room table brighten up (or your girlfriend), and the bakery case is one of my favorite places. In the morning coffee is served at the bakery and you can grab a tasty pastry.   AJ's is much more than just great groceries, with floral, lunch, a grill, and a bakery case that is filled with tasty morsels, what's not to love?

As one of my fave restaurant's in Scottsdale, the Herb Box is the perfect place for a great patio and lunch. At dinner the atmosphere is subtly romantic with string lights illuminating the patio. Other than the ambiance, the food is some of the best fresh local food I've tasted. A personal favorite is the Free Range Chicken with Goat Cheese... Can you say tasty? My mouth waters just thinking about it. Walking in, the crew at the Herb Box is some of the friendliest you'll ever meet (and the funniest). When you go, make sure to save room for dessert... the cheesecake of the moment is always a win!

Let's talk about NoRTH... I have been there a few times, okay quite a few and it is really hit or miss. New Years Eve, NoRTH was the place we decided to celebrate. We were a group of 14 and NoRTH lost our reservation. The manager tried to fake that they did not lose our reservation and move us into Bar NoRTH, which is not the same thing by any mean. It was disappointing to say the least. The food is decent and I will say that the Zucca Chips are a must try, along with the Pear and Gorgonzola Pizza. A little hesitant to go back, the location of NoRTH is great with shopping all around, and their wine list is quite strong. I enjoy the spanish cavas offered on the list partnered with an outside lunch on the patio. The weak performance on New Years Eve definitely was a let down, but again the food is a strong hold of this place.

Alright, Paradise Bakery has got me. And you know what, all it took was a cookie with my lunch. Something about a great turkey sandwich (California Turkey on wheat) partnered with a warm cookie brings me back to mom's packed lunches. It can be a little loud in the dining area, but sit outside or in the back section of the restaurant and problem solved. Recently I tried one of their signature salads (a BBQ Chicken Salad), to my surprise it was fantastic. Although I will always opt for the mom-lunch half sandwich and cookie, the salad is a nice alternative on a hot summer day.  It's a nice place to go for a relatively cheap price.

I heart thee Mojo... you make every day that much brighter. Who doesn't love the "choose your own adventure" yogurt?  I became a fan of Mojo when I moved back to AZ. A frequenter of Yogurtland, Mojo quickly became my new found hot spot. With creative flavor names like "White Boy Vanilla" and loads of great toppings, I am willing to pay the additional 5 cents an ounce. Maybe it's the fun and bright colors that make me forget it's more, or the friendly service, or the tie dye Tuesdays where if you wear tie dye your get a discount. I don't know, but whatever it is, it's working.  Today I was at the location and it was quite crowded, but the staff was still extremely friendly and the yogurt tasted delicious. (btw, the yogurt is some of the best I have ever had). On a hot summer day, this is the place you will find me. White Boy Vanilla with Reeses and I am in heaven... Hippie yogurt heaven. :)

Oh Daily Dose, you are a reason to get out of bed on a weekend morning. A fave breakfast spot of mine, the Daily Dose (DD) has it all. If you're looking for a traditional breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and goodness, this is your place. This is not what I opt for though... the Daily Dose is known for their phenomenal Peanut Butter and Jelly Belgian Waffle and the Bananas Foster Creme Brulee French Toast. There is nothing I don't like about PB & J on my waffles in the morning. To start off breakfast, the Daily Dose has one of the best cups of coffee in Scottsdale. I have grown to like the mocha's but the special blend of coffee they have ALWAYS seems to get remarks of greatness. When you go, you have to sit on the patio for breakfast. If you have a dog, bring fido along for some good people watching outside. Situated on Scottsdale Road and 1st Street in downtown, there is always something to see. One thing yet to try on the menu is the Hangover Sandwich... take a look at it when you are there. It is all things that are good, piled on a breakfast sandwich. Not sure I could finish it, but if you do, let me know!

Looking for a good non-Starbucks coffee to start your day? You've found your place! I have been on the hunt like a coffee-deprived madwoman looking for a good non-chain coffee house to make my own. Press is my spot. With complimentary wi-fi, a friendly staff, and choice tunes, I could spend all day pretending to be an online blogger at work. (if only, all my dreams) Best part of the coffee house?.... They have a fantastic chocolate cake. After a long day, or even before, I feel rejuvenated after a visit to Press. Another HUGE deal... the loose leaf teas... grab one on ice, I promise you won't be disappointed you did.

Tonight was the first time I've experienced Happy Hour at Pita Jungle. A frequent diner at the North Scottsdale location, I often opt for the Philly Pita (with steak, if you please), which is a bit of deliciousocity for your taste buds. Tonight however was out of the norm as I opted for the Happy Hour menu. Throughout the night our table tried almost everything on the menu, a few of my faves included the mini version of hummus, the mushrooms sauteed in lemon, and the falafel nuggets of joy. The best part of this lil outing was the bill, which at around $2 to $3 per item led to an outrageously low bill. This is a great place for the 'on the budget in a recession' happy hour. Win for the Pita Jungle, even beyond the normal Philly Pita 'o' goodness.

Okay Brio, I will give you the fact that your Happy Hour 'tasters' menu is quite good. I will even give you your bruschetta (the tasty steak is the best) is fantastic, but your service is seriously in need of some attention. When dining in the dining room, service is your typical average, however every time I have been in the bar for Happy Hour or for a quick bite the service has been some of the weakest in the area. Today we waited for 10 minutes for the bartender (who is the server in the bar) to come over to us to take our order. He hardly said a word and the entire interaction was simply awkward. The interaction did not improve (to my dismay) as time went on. My mom and I had a few giggles over the awkward moments but by the time we finished and had to flag down another server for our check, we were done with the giggles. If you go, try the bruschetta... oh, and avoid a seat in the bar.
