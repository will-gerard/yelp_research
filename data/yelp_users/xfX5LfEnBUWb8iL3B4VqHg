Stopped in for the Beef Rendang. The place was busy when I arrived which is a good sign. It was very good except the broccoli on top. It was easily removed.  I ordered to-go and the person who answered the phone and gave me my order was very friendly. I will return when I am back in Charlotte.

A DDD spot.  Cash only. Ordered BBQ chicken, sliced pork sammy and apple pie ala mode. I LOVE their BBQ sauce. Chicken was awesome. Fried then dunked in the sauce.  Sliced pork was moist. However, I should have gotten the pulled pork so it sopped up more sauce...or at least asked for some sauce on the side for dipping.   If I am in Charlotte again I will go back.  Only next time I will ask for more sauce and pickles!

Went for lunch on a Thursday with some co-workers. One was from Florida the other Canada.  They both really liked it.  It was the third visit by one of them. My first.  I ordered the Chili Rellano. A large Pablano pepper stuffed with chunks of chicken and typical fillings. It was dipped and fried in a panko bread crumb -like batter which I really liked compared to the "traditional" egg batter. It was thin and light. Great tasting to.  Service was excellent. I was never left wanting for a refill of my tasty beverage and they kept the salsa and hot sauces full as well as the tortilla chips. The chips were good too. They were light and tasted fresh. Not the out-of-a-bag corn chips. I will be back.

I liked this location. Clean place and friendly staff. They did not try to up-sell me any services per se, but they did "remind" me about some maintenance tasks. I always find this irritating...irritating like when I was 17 and my parents would tell me something that I already knew.  Like after reading the signage 1,000 times while I waited my turn. I'll be back to this location.

Needed to get liens removed from my titles (i.e. new title). I had my letters and it was a breeze.  The customer lounge was comfortable and clean.  The staff was very friendly.  Could have done it for free at the DMV but the DMV is horrible and it was not open on Presidents day when I needed to get this done. Just a great AAA offering that I was very happy to have.

I eat here about once a month or so. Only because of the distance.  Always fast and friendly service. Always get the same thing. Pizza and wings.  Pizza crust has a nice and chewy.  Decent sauce, but great cheese and toppings. Not much else to say. Great pizza and service. Nuff said.

PCP recommended Dr. Tindall two years ago. He was unavailable and I saw Dr. Pappas. Ended up having surgery and that joint feels excellent now. Staff is friendly and actually respond the voice messages.   I agree with David M's suggestion on scheduling 100%.

This Outback is like every other Outback I have been to. They are always clean, food, drink and service is always excellent. However, until corporate America starts giving America what they advertise then they can live  with a less than perfect score. Case and point. The Unlimited Shrimp, should be renamed Unlimited Shrimp Shrimp. All the pictures they use are not what they serve. Smaller shrimp than shown in their advertising. They tried to make the fried and buffalo shrimp bigger by adding a thick breading. Yuk, I will go back for sure,but I will nto order their Unlimited specials anymore.

Came here with a coworker who was in town. Both had the salmon prepared different ways. I liked mine and he his. The cavatappi amatriciana (try saying that fast 3 times) is worth trying rather than the standard variation of mashed potatoes, but those are good here too. Calamari is fried nice and not greasy. Thin batter like  tempura. Great chain food.

Great place. Service was great! Had some nigiri and two rolls. Everything was good and it all tasted fresh.  One of the rolls I liked was the PlayGirl. Friend ordered the Playboy and said the salmon was perfect.  The place is clean and the play 80's rock at just the right volume.

Visited on a Saturday night.  Kind of a dive, but I say that because it is older and it shows. If you like fu fu up-scale teppanyaki, go somewhere else. If you like great,  food, drink and service go to this location. Of the five of us there we had the filet combos with scallops, chicken and shrimp.  Everything was excellent.  The service was amazing. She filled our non-alcoholic beverages before we even noticed they needed filled. Our adult beverages were delivered quickly after ordering. She was very busy, but I never felt neglected.  I have been another location with the same name, but not same owners. I did not know that when I made reservations and only picked this one to come to because it had more and better Yelp reviews (Thanks everyone!). Our chef was named Cheko(?) and made sure we had a great show and awesome food.  I have one complaint... They brought extra shrimp to the table (I think...extra) and he cooked and tossed them to the other diners who ordered the the combo without shrimp. When it comes to food, DO NO share my portions with someone else. Even if they are extra, that is NOT my perception. Either knock it the %#$@ off or give me a scallop that I did not order to even it out. LOL ;-)  However, my buddy made the same comment after we left. So I there is some angst behind the humor. Next time I guess I'll order scallops and get a free shrimp.  We all said we would be back, and we will.

Ordered "Inn" last night. Pun intended. Orange Chicken, Pu Pu Platter and House Chow Mein (I freeze most of it so I can have dinner when needed.)  Everything was perfect!  Orange Chicken was not a thick breading like most other places. It was very thin and flavorful.   Everything in the platter was not overcooked.  Chow mein...no clue. Froze it.  Will be my number one Chinese delivery...as long as they keep up the good product.

Unfortunately, there is no 0 star option. I had to write this review quickly in case I die of e-coli.   The ONLY item I had that did not cause me to gag was the inari sushi (fried bean curd shell stuffed with rice). The bowl I ordered was absolutely the worst I have EVER had. EVER. The California rolls despicable.  The meat was dry. No hint a moisture or flavor. Based on the flavor, I wonder if it was even chicken. Seriously, it sucked the moisture out of my mouth when I "tried" to eat it. The vegetables had flavor, but not a good flavor. Spoiled cabbage comes to mind. I think they cooked it last week. Out of $20 of food I at the Inari and tossed everything else.(Almost "tossed" what I did eat.  The california rolls must have been made three days ago. The rice had dried out into a solid clump of gross surrounding some rotting celery, dry artificial crab meat and avocado wrapped is smelly nori.   Shame shame shame shame on Kyoto Bowl!!!!  Oh, it was VERY clean in the lobby...because NO-ONE comes in to mess it up.  Ef this place!

Went to the mall (I hate going to the mall) specifically to get a pair of glasses.  Sears, JCP and Lenscrafters were all at the same end so I was able to look at all of their frame selections before going to Lenscrafters - best selection. Did not wait long before I was assisted by Rose. She was very helpful. I spaced out the fact they had 1 hour service. NICE - I did not have to go back to pick the glasses up! Almost no-one in the shop when I selected the frames and options. Service was fast.  Shop was very busy when I returned an hour later to pick them up. They had enough staff to fill each fitting table so after signing in I waited for 2 minutes before I was given my glasses and headed out the door.  I will go back when the time comes to get another pair of glasses.

Leo Getz must have frequented this one.  "They always #$%@ in the drive through!" Forgot my hash browns in a Big Breakfast. -4 stars. Everything else was great.  +1 star. Eggs were not dry or over cooked.  Biscuit was fresh.  Sausage juicy.  Hotcakes fluffy. Hash browns - I wouldn't know because I didn't get them!!

I had been wanting to try Arriba for awhile. I am not a big fan of chain Mexican restaurants.  My cousin was in town to assist me while recovering from a surgery. He mentioned he wanted Mexican food. He graduated from the Scottsdale Culinary Institute and is a food snob, so I am VERY careful when I suggest a place. Arriba was in the list of Mexican places when I checked Yelp on my phone. I had been wanting to try Arriba  and so I warned him that I had not been there before. They did not let me down.  Chips - Hot when they came to the table (I like my chips served like that!). The hot sauces and beans that come with it were good as well except the tomato based sauce - tastes like canned tomatoes. Luckily they have others to dip the chips in.  Ordered some Chili Verde on the side to see if I liked theirs. I did. Very much. Great with the chips too.   I had the enchiladas with the three sauces.  Excellent! He had the seafood enchiladas. He loved them. He gave me a portion to try. It was very good.

This one is consistent every time I come to this restaurant. Good flavor, good service.  On occasion the fixings selection is a little "off". Brown lettuce and those tasteless winter tomatoes. But the good thing about a burger is that they are still good wiht just the basics.

A Saturday night with a few friends. We had to wait  20 minutes in the Phoenix sun. Service was impeccable. I loved the rattlesnake eggs and my steak was cooked perfect. Everyone had something different and there were no complaints on the quality of the food or taste. There were pork chops, chopped steak thing, prime rib, filet and a NY strip delivered to our table. I have one regret. I am not a fan of their flavored lemonades. I tried the peach and strawberry and they both have a very odd and off-putting aftertaste (IMHO). I will stick to Iced Tea when I return.

Summation of two visits within 1 week... First visit was during lunch rush. Second was late lunch post-rush.  Nice comfortable interior. Good to excellent service. Good food.  Was left wanting for drink refills the first visit during lunch rush. Second visit I felt like I was in a 5 star restaurant with the service we received.   I had the Chili Relleno both times.  First time I ordered it it had a bunch of grilled or sauteed onions on top. Didn't care for the onions. Second time I ordered it smothered in Green Chili. It was a little better but the green chili had little pieces of overcooked pork (I think) in it. Threw the taste off for me. So I avoided those little chunks.  Good quality cheese.  My coworkers loved the Steak Picata. I'll return when in the area.

Been several times.  Always good. One time I went for lunch and the grill was broken. We had to wait for them to repair it and that took about 30 minutes before the burgers started coming out. It was still worth the wait.

I really like Fuddruckers and have for years. Their food is consistently great. I have been to this location the most in my 20+ years in the Valley. They have been 5 stars easily every time I have eaten here. However, I have always ordered pretty much the same items. The last time I came I had to try the pretzel bun for an extra buck. Everything was the usual 5 stars, but the bun was a complete let down. Not because the taste, but because of the employee who assembled the burger. Half the bun was dry. I cannot understand why anyone who is payed to simply put a patty on a bun cannot "feel" it is dry.  This is more of a notice to managers to teach their employees the difference between FRESH (One their main marketing hypes) and NOT fresh.  This is based on a visit on 10/17 at approx 1 PM.  p.s They changed the Onion Ring batter to a much lighter batter that is a real improvement IMO. I like the Onion RIngs even more now.

Ordered wings and Philly with Cheez Whiz and Chocolate shake. I am undecided on the Philly though. Tasted very salty to me. I have not had Cheeze Whiz for years and cannot remember if it is that salty or if the beef was overly seasoned. Next time I will have provolone instead of the Whiz. Wings and shake were both spot on.

For a quick fix for mexican food I love Caramba. I aways get the Pollo Fundido and cheese crisp. This time I added the the Caramba special  - a ginormous burrito to eat the next day. As usual, it was good. The restaurant is always clean. Generic sterile looking interior. Staff is always friendly too.

Went on a late Saturday morning. Ordered a breakfast item - Chorizo Burro and a lunch/dinner item - Chili Relleno Plate. I wanted to see if it was worth the drive for future visits in one stop.  The chorizo burrito was very good. It has more seasoning than the "-berto" style joints in a 5 mile radius. I like this fact. WIll go back for breakfast. The Chili Rellenos were the same as the others. I would not go back for the rellenos...but the fact that the burro was so good I would try another menu item if I was in the area.

Ordering from here for years. Until a couple years ago, I gave them 5 stars. Then a couple pizza I ordered were not so good and I dropped them to 1 star. I mean they were really bad. I have tried them since a few times and have adjusted my review to 4 stars.  The caveat is not to order anything with additional toppings. They skimp on the extras you pay for...in my cheap-o-I-want-what-I-pay-for mentality.  Wings are always good.

Competitive prices and great selection items for our pets.  Had return that I thought I was going to get a lot of grief about with no receipt.

I used to come to this store for lunch when they first opened years ago.  I haven't been in awhile and wanted fish tacos on Saturday. I picked a couple up to take out.  This place "used" to be good.   I do not know exactly "what" it was..the fish or the tortilla, but it was just a mouthful of mush.  The fish was a little tiny sliver of breading with fish in it (supposedly).  I spit it out and tossed it in the trash.  Tried the second taco...same thing.  Had I been at the store, I would have demanded my money back.  I do not know they are this disgusting on just the weekends or if they consistantly serve this substandard crap throughout the week.  I will never know because they lost my business!

The dining room is very sterile looking and restaurant furniture. So the ambiance is meh.  But it is CLEAN.  The lady at the front counter is very friendly and has NEVER messed up my order. I should know her name by now but I don't. My bad.  My food is always hot and out of all the times I have been there.. I have never been disappointed. My egg roll and crab rangoon are never over cooked.   It is not "slap your mama in the face good", but I would never do that anyways. I keep going back because it is consistently good...at least the Mandarin Hot Chicken which is pretty much my favorite dish there. I keep wanting to try the Bulgogi, but I just can't get leave without my Mandarin Hot Chicken.  Plus, I usually pick up dinner on the way home and she has Judge Judy on the TV. I love Judge Judy too!

Coming to this McDonald's is like a box of chocolates, cause you never know what a your going to get. A smorgasbord of different experiences.   Parked for an iced coffee the last visit and then when it came it tasted like they gave up waiting for fresh coffee and brought me what they had left over from the night before...bitter. Two sips and out the window it went (I kept the cup, I did not litter). Seriously...parked for an iced coffee???  Plus they give me my HOT food to wait for a cold drink.   Without writing a book, my experience dictates that this location should only be visited during rush hours. The staff seems to lack the mental capacity to understand anything about quality, communication or consistency.   Management, I highly recommend you re-train your staff on actual McDonald's corporate procedures and learn the guidelines on what is considered fresh...and how to read a clock.

Updating my review after several weeks. Appears maybe the managers read these reviews. In the last few weeks this store has improved 2 stars. The eggs in my BBs have been cooked perfectly, Diet Coke tastes better and they have not forgotten anything in all my visits. Added two stars because they have been consistently 5 stars since my last review...but I am still watching.

The restaurant itself is a generic, sterile looking hole in the wall.  Clean and the staff is friendly.  Full Belly "used to have" one of the best French Dips in the area... My how the mighty have fallen.  I am a sucker for a good French Dip and Full Belly "used to be" be 5 stars. Their French Dip used to consist of a fresh bun, a generous pile of real unprocessed sliced roast beef and a pretty good au jus.  They changed. For the worse. The French Dip may still be on a fresh bun. but the lighter softer cheaper flavorless roll. The kind that falls apart when dipped in the au jus and no flavor. They also switched to a tasteless, processed style of roast beef that makes the fast food chain that starts with "Ar" and ends with "by's" taste like prime rib at Morton's Steakhouse. The au jus may have been a generic beef broth poured out of a can with no seasoning.  To be fair, I have had other items and they were all good in the past, but I am fearful the other menu items have suffered the same fate and am not going to spend my money to find out when there are too many other options in the area...the place that starts with "Ar" and ends with "by's" is just down the street.

For a chain this store is OK. Clean and friendly staff...and the place is clean too! The food is hot most of the time. Drive thru gets my order filled correctly every time. No shorted items that I can remember. Their prices are higher than another Wendy's less than a mile from this one. Probably because they are so close to the highway.

Older Harkins, but clean and well maintained.  Parking is horrible at the mall.  Concession counter experience was good.  My Ultimate Dog was actually good. No hard microwaved bun and no wrinkly microwaved hot dog. This seems to be an issue at the other Harkins, but this was just one visit, so maybe I was lucky. The guy at the counter commented that these were the best hot dogs for the money anywhere around.$5 for a microwaved hot dog? Yeah right. He needs to get out more.  Sub par hot dogs are my pet peeve at theaters. A bad dog can ruin the visit.   Coke Zero tasted "off".

I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have.  The food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best.

I can honestly say I have tried everything on their menu. I can honestly say that everything on their menu is awesome. Even the stuff I would no normally order again was pretty good. You cannot go wrong with the Jade and Jerk chicken. Love the Snickerdoodles too.  The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is the ordering system...and that is all I am going to say about it...oh and maybe the long lines...because Chino's is so freaking good!

If you know what Scotch you like, chances are they have it.  I am just learning the nuances of drinking scotch. I heard good things about Magnums and I have been twice.  Both times I left a little overwhelmed...but I have now had time to evaluate my experiences and put some thought into it. I was in a real bad mood the second visit, but I my evaluation still holds when I think back.  First visit - Ordered two (2) flights (samples of scotches, had four (4) in each flight - Magnums choice). Scotch was served in the traditional vinum and there was an adequate amount to properly "sample". Their "machine" was broken and we were each given a total price (seemed a little pricey...but  hey, it is Scotch.) I noticed the smell of AZ tap water in the glasses, but being a newbie, I was not sure what was proper etiquette. That was then...  Second visit - I was in a really bad mood and probably should have stayed home, but I did not. I was schooled the week before by a scotch lover with an extensive selection of fine scotches in his cabinet. I also researched the proper scotch tasting techniques. Armed with this knowledge and a little practice earlier in the week, I ordered one flight of four (4)  - my selections. I kindly asked if they could hand wash the glasses (because of visit #1). I was told they wash their glasses in filtered water and some other stuff, I don't remember. (I was fending off my friends jokes about how they were going to spit clean my glasses because I was being too picky), so I smiled and said OK.  Whatever the case, they did not smell like AZ tap water. The glasses were rocks\old fashion glasses. Picky? Absolutely.  If I am paying good money at a fancy scotch bar...and sampling multiple scotches...put them in the proper glass so I can have a proper sample!!! To top it all off, there was barely one swallow per glass. FAR less than what was gotten the first time. Not even a half a standard swig!  I ordered my favorite of the four afterwards and I would have to say the samples were about 1/5 of what a full order is...but charged for 1/2 of the drink. Am I wrong in my perception? Maybe, but I'd like someone to explain their flight pricing to me .  The place it too small to reserve tables. The first night they had three tables reserved and no-one showed up! I saw potential customers walk in and turn around and leave because there was no place to sit...and there were those three (3) empty tables with "Reserved" signs on them. The second visit, there was one reserved table. We ordered, paid and left...and that one table was still empty. REALLY??? Wonder how much money they lost on the no shows. As a side note, my friend wanted a specific scotch. He had me call earlier in the day to see if they had it. I was told they did not. Fair enough...Then we got there and my friend asked in the front where the liquor store and humidor are...still out (and for the last couple of weeks). he also ordered it and when she went back to check if they have it they did. mmmmm... This confused me..did they have a secret stash for regular customers and succumbed to his persistence and break it out for him, or give him something else and say it was what he wanted just to shut him up? Tooo fishy.   I am disappointed!! Magnums is so close to home and I could see myself spending more time and money there. The interior is VERY comfortable. The bar is amazing. The tables (when you can get them are just like I want at home. Chairs are comfortable. They have multiple TVs hanging the walls with various sports on them (muted audio). But even better,  they have the center screens above the bar playing concert videos WITH the concert audio. It is obvious the owners paid a lot of attention to detail in every aspect. I SOOOOO WANTED Magnums to be that place. I am sad that is was not.

I really liked Bobby Q. Made reservations for a Saturday night. We shared some Q Rolls and then ordered our own entrees. I loved the Q rolls. One of three at the table thought them a tad greasy, Two of us did not. I had the three meat combo with Brisket, St Louis Ribs and Chicken. Mac and Cheese and fries. Was the meat the best I ever had? No, but it was dang good. My favorite of the three was the Brisket.  Shoestring fries are my favorite fries and what I opt for them when I can. I demolished the large pile they put on the plate. The Mac and Cheese tastes like it is made with that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I love that processed cheese food that starts with a V. I have had lots of different versions of mac and cheese with my BBQ across the US. They may have used a fancy blend of real cheeses, but in the end, the processed cheese food at Bobby's is right at the top of my fav list. Adult beverages are a bit pricey, but they are good and not watered down.  The service was great. Joe was our waiter. He was new but I would not have guessed until his supervisor came to the table.   I will be back.

Always stop in for breakfast before a flight out. Service is always good and never had a bad breakfast. It is pricey... but it is at the airport.

Great chain BBQ. I have been several times. This location is clean and the staff friendly.  The food came out hot and the drinks were kept full. I had no complaints. I feel their prices are not bad for the amount of food you get.

Used to have a 4 stars with me. Not no more. I have made two visits since my last review and each was was worse than the last.  My last visit  was a to-go order.   Pad Thai, Pineapple Fried Rice, Summer rolls and combo appetizer.   Pad Thai was good. Not outstanding, but I did not feel cheated.  Combo platter was good, just overpriced for what you get.  The Pineapple Rice had NO pineapple in it. NONE.  Really? Who misses the ingredient that the dish is named after? Seriously?  I got my answer... The same one who made the summer rolls. There was way too much thai basil in them. It was like eating a bouquet of flowers. This is why I opened them up and found the lettuce. The lettuce inside was the thickest nastiest white part that was all oxidized. To the trash with them.  There are too many options that are just a little further away...but worth the drive.  Original review.. I have been here three times over the last couple of years.  The first two times were 5 starts easy. I seek out Thai when I travel and this is one of the better Thai places when I am home.  We tried the following items. Duck - I cannot remember the exact dish, but it was not the Crispy Duck. It was just OK. I like duck, but not this dish in particular. I would NOT order this dish again. Others liked it, so don;t take my word for it. My buddy and I each ordered the red curry chicken. I went with Medium and he with the  Hot. The hotness was just right and they have the Thai chili peppers and various hot sauces to add more. Mu only complaint was the green beans were very "woody". Not canned, but too old and they lost their freshness and were like chewing on Lincoln Logs (remember those?). I would have preferred they left them out because the rest of the dish was excellent. Because they were included they affected the rating. The Chicken Satay which was moist and full of flavor. The Summer Rolls with Shrimp were very good. Lots of fresh veggies and wrapped in rice paper with the accompanying sauces. Though there could have used more shrimp.  We went on Saturday early evening and they were not very busy. Scary on a Saturday night, but it was good.  The service was excellent and the waitress was very helpful and she explained where explanation was needed.  I will go back.

I went for an early dinner on a Saturday night. with two friends. There were only three other tables and two already had their food.  They asked if we wanted one of the BBQ tables, we said yes that is what we came for. Here is how the dinner progressed...  1) Asked for the sushi  menu and ordered iced tea.  2) 10 minutes passes (maybe more, I am feeling generous) and the drinks come. We handed her the sushi order and placed our BBQ order.  3) 5 minutes later we get our teas.  4) Maybe 20 minutes later (still being generous) and they bring out our BBQ order...COOKED!!!! and COLD!!!!! We said we wanted to cook our own. (We were sitting at the freaking BBQ table and...they asked us when they sat us!!) We get some comment that it was too hot inside. Now get this, the table that had just left next to us had cooked their own!!  5) Then they bring us the miso soup...luke warm at best. (Did I say there were only three other tables??  6) 15 minutes later they bring the sushi.  7) Absolutely-appalling-yuk-disgusting-gag-a-maggot. The rice was not sticky and the whole thing fell apart when put in the soy\wasabi dip. The rice they served with the BBQ was stickier. I should have disassembled the sushi and made my own at the table using that rice. The nori was chewy, like the sushi had been sitting for too long. I spit most of it out into my napkin. I question the freshness of the tuna and scallops as well. I hope I do not get food poisoning.  8) The service was horrible. When I needed a refill, they never came. I was sucking on the straw loudly trying to get their attention. (yes, uncouth, but come on!!!) My buddy got so frustrated he got up grabbed our glasses and took them to their drink station to fill them up. The servers were on the other side of the partition eating and having a conversation.  I will NEVER eat at this worthless dump again.  They were lucky I left them a ten percent tip. I seriously thought of stiffing on the tip and in hindsight I should have.  Eat at this place at your own risk!!

Been twice in the last couple of months. Both times was excellent. Sushi is fresh and has a very nice presentation. We like to cook our own food on the grill. They got new grills in the table tops between my two visits. I have tried the pork, chicken and beef. Service is excellent and we never wanted for anything as they kept every glass filled and food on the table. Love this place. Love it!

I have purchased many sets of tires over the years from Discount Tire. Three sets total from this location. I searched for prices on-line and called all the local tire sellers to find the best price. I found a couple on-line companies that I could get them cheaper for, but mostly just the difference in tax. I opted (again) to use a local retailer for tires. They are local and I do not have to transport tires to the shop...and the tires I wanted were on sale. Once I decided where to buy my tires I was able to check online for store stock. I called the store and spoke to Ryan who informed me those tires were on sale. Being strapped for time, I asked what times were available for an appointment. He said he could put me in the queue now and I would be up in about 15. I arrived in 10, paid for the tires and they had it in the bay before I put my credit card back in my wallet. 30 min later and I was off with 4 new tires.  I will be back.

Took my cat 18 year old cat in for some issues he was having. Mike was very good with my lil' buddy. He was thorough in his diagnosis and in no way made me feel like a heartless jerk when I did not have some expensive tests performed just to "confirm". He provided me with the options and explained each one so that I could understand and make the decision by myself without any pressure or guilt.  I've had my cats to various vets throughout the valley over the years and Dr. Mike Lee is my first choice.  EVERY single person in the office is very nice and caring. (As observed by the activity in lobby as I was waiting).  I have recommended all my friends take thier animals there.

Ha! Some of the bad reviews are spot on! At least those in regard to the owner/counter person. I always felt like she did not want to be there and I was an inconvenience that I was an idiot for having the audacity to order from her restaurant.  Reminds me of the "Gyro Nazi".  That aside, the food is alright by me. My last visit on Saturday was pleasant (owner was not there). The man in that cooked the food brought it to me and was very polite. I left feeling appreciated for spending my money there... especially when I ordered and paid for the extra dose of gyro meat in my gyro.  I actually got the extra meat. (I hate it when I order and pay for "extra" on my sammy and the only thing they get right is charging me. Not here, not his time. I'll keep going back.

I've had Rosati's from several locations in Phoenix. At my house I have two stores within range and when I am at my friends we order Rosati's near them. Ordered a Pan style. The ingredients are very good (as they are at every Rosati's I've ordered from) and it actually arrived without the top of the pizza sliding all to one side... Kudos the the delivery guy.  However, I counted six (6) tomato tops in the sauce on the pieces I grabbed. In my opinion it completely ruined my experience. The tops I am referring to are where the stem connects to the tomato. That little piece of stem ruined it for me. One maybe....six????

Was craving wings and decided to drive a bit to get them. They are good, but I find the rubs a little too salty.  Had the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic. Ate the Lousiana, not the Parmesan Garlic. The parmesan cheese smelled like an spoiled dish rag. You all know that smell.  Stunk my vehicle up all the way home.  Tossed right in the trash.  Will NOT be going back. Does the staff not have any olfactory senses?

I've found Billy three years ago through a friend of mine after having an off-putting experience with a re-fret on one of my guitars. He said take it to this guy. I did, and I owe my friend many thanks! I took an acoustic to Billy to setup...just to try him out. Since, he has done all sorts of work for me from basic setups to entire re-frets.  If you want a particular sound, ask Billy, he will educate you.  Billy has worked on every one of my guitars at some point and they ALL play incredible.   Cons: He does not have anybody working for him. He does ALL the work himself. Because of this there is a wait. But I tell you what...it is well worth it!

Fed up and disgusted with this location.  The last three times I have visited there was something wrong.   Once they are out of the chicken I ordered.  The last two times they shorted me items.  Wish I could give negative stars.  Don't care what anyone in the office wants.  I am NOT going back to this location EVER!

Stopped in after reading the reviews.  I arrived about 12:50PM.  It was packed. By 1:15 the place had cleared out pretty much. I ordered to-go and waited by the front counter. Their staff was working very hard. They were all running around helping customers. They were all moving VERY fast.  The place was clean and they proudly posted their health rating of A on their front door and counter. I like that!  I ordered the Pho Tai, spring rolls and calamari. The Pho was great. I order the beef raw so it can cook in the hot broth to my liking. Plenty of beef was served.  The spring rolls were good.  The calamari was over-breaded and not cooked all the way through. It was also over-salted. More breading than calamari. I will pass on this item next time.

Only had pizza and wings.   They were not busy at all. Wings looked and tasted like they had been cooked a long time before. Slimy. Ate two wings. Tossed the rest. I live minutes away and there is no way they went from fresh cooked to what I got in 10 minutes. No freaking way. Like they were sitting in the sauce all day. Skimpy on the sauce too.  The pizza was NOT what I expected...just OK. The cheese was good, but that is the only thing about that was.  Sauce, first off, should not have been on the pizza. It was a Margherita pizza.  First place EVER that I had tomato sauce on a Margherita pizza. Their menu did not specify, so I assumed it was traditional. To top it off, it was VERY salty.   The crust was not cooked all the way through and the toppings were scant. (Except the cheese). Minimal amount of fresh basil. so little that I could barely taste it.  I'll try again and update the review if I have a better experience (Going to go when it is busy to increase the chances of "fresh")  But at the price I paid, I expected FAR better that what I got!

Great sushi place.  Went with some out of town friends. They were hesitant at first because they didn't relate Phoenix with good sushi. They left happy and with changed minds. We shared several rolls, the names escape me now. I love their iced green tea. It actually had flavor, the best green tea I ever had. I will return here soon with my local sushi eaters.

The theater itself is nice and clean. 5 stars. I also like the fact Harkins is an AZ company (learned from the pre-movie slides). If I was rating the building and janitorial functions... 5 stars. Bring in all the other factors that make for a pleasant movie experience such as concessions and customer service, and it plummets.   I always get a large popcorn, loyalty cup refill and an Ultimate Dog.   Concessions are hit and miss...mostly miss. It is irritating while standing in line to see employees talking behind the popcorn poppers in small groups while the lines are backed up. I rarely see a manager back in concessions. The ticket window must be really complicated and require constant supervision because I never see them in concessions. Tip: Make sure you check anything you order at concessions that requires someone heating it before serving it BEFORE you give up your spot at the concession counter. I have been given over nuked hot dogs...both dog and bun more often than not. VERY VERY disappointing after paying concession prices.  Questions: How hard can it be to look at a $5 hot dog and "see" that it is over cooked? How hard can it be to notice the ends of the hot dog bun are dry and hard?  Answer: Apparently it is VERY VERY difficult based on my experiences there!!! As a side note... My buddy often gets a pizza. The consistency is never there. One time it is under-cooked, second time, overcooked and sometimes just right.  2 Stars - Because I feel ripped off every time I pay $5 for a supposedly "Ultimate" dog.

Went here for happy hour to meet some people from work on a Thursday night. Great happy hour specials. Younger crowd. Food was very good. We had several appetizers at the table and a couple of rolls.  Sushi quality was very good and they do not make their rolls so large that makes it difficult to eat in one bite. (One of my pet peeves). I will be back.

I frequent several Harkins depending on movie times that work with my schedules..and I like matinees because they are cheaper and nobody is really there. AWESOME! I think this is the best Harkins in North Central Phoenix east of the 51 and north of Dunlap and as far west as the 101. Got it? Good. moving on. The Ultimate Dog was perfect. No hard bun, overcooked dog, etc.. Popcorn was hot. The place is clean. Service at concessions moved quick. I like the popcorn seasoning they make available.

below average BBQ. Had two meat plate. Pulled pork was dry. Had to wet it down with a lot of BBQ sauce. Sliced Brisket was so dry it crumbled apart. Not even BBQ sauce could save it. Jalapeno Beans are VERY bland and not even a HINT of jalapeno.  Original Potato Salad was just OK. I've eaten at Dickey's in other states and really enjoyed them.  Here...not so much. Very disappointed.

The stars say it all. 2 Stars = Meh, I've experience better. First time here because friend knew I like good BBQ. I do, I LOVE Great BBQ. Dillon's was neither.  First time there I ordered a combo platter with three (3) meats.  Brontosaurus Beef Ribs - 1 single Baby Back rib has more meat on it that one of these. Sad, very sad. The brisket was bland. OK, smoke ring, but barely tasted the smoke. How do they do that????? The burnt ends were just OK.Meaty, but bland. DO they wash the smoke off? The mac and cheese was edible, but I think Kraft does a better job and that is gross. Did they not like me and not want me back as a customer? They win, I won't be back. Tooooo many other options.

The better of the two mexican restaurants during my stay in Charlotte. Plan on a long lunch if you go. They were very busy and we had a tale of 6. So, it took them awhile to serve us all. As I watched I never saw an employee on the floor that was not doing something. Nobody was hiding in a corner ignoring customers.  Food was good and arrived hot. Their table-side guacamole service was a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty. Hot chips. Ordered a combo plate with chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada.  Did not expect the rellano to be stuffed with beef, but it was. I was not impressed with the meat in the relleno and taco. It was seasoned ground beef which reminds me of fast food tacos. Does that ring a "bell"? They had an interesting hot sauce. I think it was the juice from canned green chilies and some chopped onions and other seasoning. Was not bad. Everyone else at the table was happy with their selections. They frequent this place and were familiar with the menu.  I will be back if in the area again.

Had dinner on a Friday night with two friends that recommended the place.  Chowder - Excellent. Thick and creamy base with lots of clam bits and the right amount of veggies. Not filled with potatoes like others I have had.  Fish - Excellent. Crisp batter crust in the right proportions. More fish than crust. But just enough crust to absorb the malt vinegar that I like on fish.  Scallops - Excellent. Thin panko crust and huge juicy scallop inside.  Shrimp - Excellent. Fried. Big. No complaints here.  Fries - Excellent. Thin (Like I like) and fried perfectly. I like them with lots of salt and the malt vinegar.  I will be back.

Update: Years since original review in 2011. Still eat here. Ratio of burned to not-burned food has decreased, but not enough to merit the 5th star.  I eat here often.  Good food at a decent price. Hit or miss though on the quality. I hate it when they burn the taco shell or tortillas and I don't find out until I get home. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to make me comment. Glad I didn't leave a review the day that happened. I'd give them 5 stars if it never happened again.

I had my car detailed today. 11 year old BMW. It has some spider scratches all over that were driving me up the wall.  I called the number on a Friday morning and reached Victor. (Make sure you call 602-321-8016, not the 480 number at the top of their website).  Victor showed up on time at 7:00AM on a Saturday and got to work.  I had a wash, polish, and sealer applied on Saturday and he came back on Monday to apply carnuba wax after letting the sealant cure. After the polish and sealant it made my car look like it was brand new and "wet". He was very professional and explained everything he was doing.  The end result was excellent and I will be using this place again!

Yelp scored again. Thanks to everyone and their reviews.  I was hungry, but for something light. I decided on Pho. Searched for Pho in my zip code and this was the first place that came up. Read the reviews and decided to go. Inside it was clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly. I ordered to-go.  Pho Nam, Spring Rolls and Summer Rolls...not to adventurous. My order was quickly prepared and off I went.  Everything was very good. The broth had actual flavor, not just a clear broth. Ample additions such as the bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapenos, cilantro, a wedge of lime, peanut sauce, garlic chili sauce, hoisin, sirachi and a vinegar/fish sauce (?) all came with it.  I will be back.

Ate here with some coworkers. It was not that busy on a Monday night. We sat in the bar and watched the game whilst we caught up with each other. I had the Seared Eastern Scallops.  Deliciouso! We did not order any apps. The beer was cold and the service was excellent. I had no complaints. One of my buds said his was awesome and he wanted to go back next time he is in town.  Another said his fish (Mahi Mahi Daily Special) was a little dry. I told him to send it back, but he was content despite the fact. I figure if I am paying for a sit down meal with prices higher than a typical chain restaurant that it better be cooked to my liking.  I deducted 1 star because of his comment.  Just an entree and iced tea was over $32+tip.  Lots of TVs in the bar.

Decent hotel. I normally stay at a Hilton. Excellent service from the staff.  Hotel is clean. Bed was comfortable. Shower pressure was good.  No room service. They have a kitchen, but you have to go there and pick it up. Saves on the auto-gratuity and the high risk of cold food, but OK. Grounds were very clean. Did not use their Wi-Fi so cannot speak to that.

The Yelp rating is what made me drive out of my way to pickup a late lunch. If I were just driving by this shop I would have never stopped.  I ordered a three taco plate with three different tacos. I do not remember the names, but they were ALL excellent! I ordered a Quesadilla. It is different from the Americanized version but I did not care for it. Love all the salsas!

I was hungry for Gyro. I checked Yelp and saw a place I had not heard of before.  It is a nice market and restaurant.  I wanted to sample a couple of menu items of my typical Mediterranean cravings.  Gyro - Lamb and beef and grilled. Decent portion too. Hummus was very good. Grape leaves are really good. The filling is seasoned well like they should be. Not the tasteless wrapped in a grape leaf. I could make a meal of these alone. I am glad I found them.

Tried Stevie's for the first time. Delivery by Grubhub. I was hesitant about delivery because they use Grubhub. Was not familiar with Grubhub, but they delivered on time. The text updates were a bit concerning since I received a text that said my order was on the way and the ETA was 45 min to an hour. I preheated the oven just in case. They showed up 15 minutes after I received the text.  So no more worries about ordering delivery for me.  Like the thin crust on the pizza. It crisped up nicely on the reheat. Not greasy like many pizza places. They nailed the extra-crispy wings. Perfect. Meaty wings and not the tiny hummingbird wings so many other pizza place use. I really liked the mozzarella sticks. They tasted like they were battered in the restaurant and not bought frozen. I will order again.

My first Five Guys experience was in Atlanta. I was so impressed I looked into what it would take to open a franchise in Phoenix. Quickly discovered that they were already in Phoenix and anxiously awaited for this store to open.   What a freaking let down. I agree with Justin D.   Mr Owner, visit your store and crack down on the staff!!!  I do not think it is the ingredients, it is the preparation.   Overcooked burger and underdone fries. The staff needs to get it together.  Did you even train your staff?  Does the store manager know he is supposed to oversee food quality?    This location's food is NOTHING compared to what I had in Atlanta. I thought the Atlanta store blew away In-n-Out.   I only hope they figure it out. I'll return in a few months with hope that someone learns to cook a burger and fries properly. I mean seriously, What else is there on the menu???   The only bright side of this experience is that it can not get any worse.

No fancy schmancy interior. Just clean and cost effective. Best cheese curds I've had in Phoenix. Not fast food style with homemade breading, not frozen varieties like others. Had a hot dog as well.  Not a big fan of their sauerkraut, but I am picky being Polish and German.  Good dog and a good bun.  Staff was friendly too. I will definitely be back for my cheese curds and dog fix...and to try a burger.

Traditional wings are not the scrawny little things so many places have. Great selection of sauces. Have not tried every flavor yet, but I will. Other food items are great as well.  Service was always friendly and fast.

Been twice. Probably the best BBQ in North Phoenix.  I like the following things in BBQ. #1) Smokey flavor - I want to know it spent lots of time in smoke. #2) Moist #3) Great sauce Ordered the side of two ribs and a pulled pork sandwich. Fail on #1 for both. Smoke flavor was not what I consider smokey.  They nailed #2 and #3. Little lacking in the smokey flavor for my taste, but it is what I expect when I go out for BBQ, Beans with the burnt ends are pretty darn good. Potato salad was good. Sweet potato fries and waffle fries are good.  Staff is friendly and the place is kept very clean.  I'll go back for sure.

I read a couple negative reviews and was blown away. They are the absolute opposite of all my interactions with Dr. Bailey.  Dr. Bailey has been my ENT for at least 8 years for three different issues. He has performed surgery, prescribed my CPAP and treated my sinus and throat issues. All of which have made my quality of life so much better.  His office is very tasteful and the staff is super friendly.   Most important is that I feel he genuinely cares about my well being.

Was looking for another breakfast burrito option that was close to the house and stumbled on this place via Yelp. Ordered the Chorizo Special and Green Chili Burrito. Chorizo Special was OK. Would have been better if I liked my papas cooked like the culinary world says they should be cooked. I don't. I like soft papas. I couldn't really tell if the chorizo was spicy or not. Will get a regular chorizo burrito next time.  The Green Chili Burrito was excellent! Lots of filling and it was good.

Wow, reviews all over the board! I went for lunch and got a Regular Italian Mike's way. The amount of meat was perfect.  Thin? Yes...but there was plenty. The lettuce was fresh today as someone else mentioned. The bread was very good and fresh. (I was in around 11:00AM so that helps). The vinegar was tasty, yes I agree, there are some vinegars that taste better than others....they have good vinegar here. Overall, not the best I have ever had, but it is pretty darn good.

Didn't know what to expect. Went for lunch. Ordered the sampler with the chicken, pork and beef. Ordered an order of fish as well, just so I could try as much as possible. Macaroni salad on side. It was all very good. Healthy? I don't think so, but it did taste good. The place was VERY clean and everyone was nice.  Had to wait a little longer for my order as someone came in and obviously ordered for their office.  NOT disappointed as so many other places have left me recently.

I have two kittens with a medical condition. I had to travel for work and was trying to decide if I would board them or hire someone to come over and care for them in their own environment. I did not want them stressed by a strange environment. My vet recommended LYPT. Paula came to the house to meet the kitties and discuss their care a couple of days before I had to leave for my trip.  She texted me few pics of them every day and a comment on how they were doing.  It made my mornings knowing they were well and tended to. I got home and they were alive and well.  I will be using LYPT anytime I have to travel in the future.

Service? Here? Yeah right. I was seated in the middle of the main walkway. I could have asked to sit somewhere but I was short on time and needed to eat before I got on my plane. It would be awhile before I could eat again. I sat there for about 10 minutes while I watched them go take orders from other customers that walked in before me...and I was in their path.   Ordered a burrito.  It arrived. Tasted like a bland version of a Chipotle burrito....and I am not a fan of Chipotle.  I was charged twice for my drink. Probably would have paid and not given it a second thought until I saw it later, but at $3.50 a soda. It was VERY obvious.  Next time I'll eat before I get through security or try another concourse.

Tried one sandwich. Large = Ginormous. Ordered the meatball sub. Sauce was a little bland, but the bread was fresh and the meatballs were good. I will try something different next time. They have 5 star potential, I just haev ti give it another try.

The staff was friendly. Small place so seating was adequate. Had the Booze Burger and chips with a rainbow shake (vanilla with sprinkles). Burger was good and I was not disappointed. I like their unique take on the burgers. Will have to try some others when I am in the neighborhood. Always like places that do homemade potato chips. The shake was very good too.

For a place that has pizza cooked and ready to reheat they are pretty good.  Brooklyn fold-n-eat style crust was good.  They use good ingredients so it tasted good.  Over all they were good and I will return if I return to the area...and want pizza.

4 start only because I feel like I am ripped off every time I purchase a used game at "close-to-new" pricing on top of only getting a few cents on the dollar for my trade-ins. Staff is very knowledgeable about the games and systems and very friendly.

I found Lowell though Billy at B&D Guitar Repair before he moved his operation to B&D's location .   I have two vintage Marshall JMP 45W heads. One was made in 76 that did NOT have the vintage tone.  I had two other people work on it. Both with very good knowledge of my amps.  I had them install Mercury Magnetic transformer, power supply and choke. They also attempted to modify the circuit to match the circuit of an amp to match that of a loaner amp that possessed the tone I wanted. The loaner amp was my new baseline for tone.  We even tried to source the exact cable that was used in loaner amp to make sure everything was the same. Nothing worked.   I ended up buying another JMP head made in 78 (same year as the loaner). The tone was close to my wants, but still not as good.  Enter Lowell.  I took both heads to him. After several conversations I decided I did not want two amps that sounded the same and decided to let him have free reign on the 76. He made it so it sounds like the higher gain JCM800. AWESOME!  For the 78, Lowell made it sound better than the loaner amp!  Lowell is now my amp guy! He is honest and very easy to talk too. He knows his stuff and what to do to get every bit of tone out of an amp tailored to your desires.  Next on his bench is my British made VOX AC30-TB that is missing "something".   I KNOW you will not be disappointed with anything he does.

First visit. Early lunch.11:00AM on a Thursday. Sampled Moist and Regular Brisket and smoked turkey. Ordered moist brisket sandwich, slaw & potato salad. The brisket was moist. They do it right. Melts in your mouth and you can basically chew it with your tongue.Smoky pork goodness galore! The slaw was ..meh. No tang, mostly cabbage in a bland watery sauce. The potato salad was good. Nothing to write home about, but it had a good tang to it and was not off-putting. Free drink refills. Large gets you a big plastic cup that you can bring back in for $.75 refills.  I drove from north Phoenix to met a friend for lunch on my day off and I would say it was worth the trip. My buddy had the beans, which he stated in his review, were bland. Even after doctoring them up with BBQ sauce.  Would have been 5 start except for the mediocre sides.

I order delivery a lot from here. They keep up to their freakishly fast delivery because I live so close.  Sandwiches are always great. I cannot think of any orders they have messed up or forgotten anything.

Came here for a late lunch with a friend who had frequented them in the past before they changed to BBQ. It was less than 30 minutes before closing which we were not aware of until we left.  The decor is nothing I would expect in a BBQ place, but it was very clean and the staff was very friendly despite them not able to close because we were still there. However...  The pulled pork sandwich and it was good. They only gave me a little cup of BBQ sauce. Probably could have asked for more, but I did not.  The potato salad tasted great , but was a little dry for such large chunks of potato. My friend thought it was really good. The ginger ale was missing something. It was not very sweet at all. Because they make their own syrup I am not sure if they forgot the sweetener or just half-a$$ed it so they could close on time. I would not order it again without tasting it to see if there was a difference.  I had to try a hot link as well. It was excellent. I will probably return and order these as my main course.

It was a Sunday AM at ~6:30 AM. Place was empty. Me = only customer. Only positive was the service....and I question that because the server had to see the lack of quality on the plate that was set before me...and still left it. So here is what my $20  bought me (includes tax and tip)...  Ordered Omelette Mexicali and a soda.. I do not know what was specifically wrong with the eggs, but they were not right. I think the menu states three eggs...yeha right...unless they meant quail eggs. Kind a watery on top of it.  A "little" toss of cheese on top.  The pico on the plate was old. Seriously? I appeared to be the first customer of the day and they give me this old stuff? Yuk!  The potatoes were disgusting. Ate two bites.  They were old, wrinkly and soggy. They had a funny taste to them that I could not place. I almost had to use the air-sick bag on the plane when I was thinking "Why did I eat those?". Oh..the toast was good with the packaged butter and jelly.  They are NOT getting any more of my money...ever. I am OK paying airport process for food, but if it is disgusting like this then shame on them!!!   Please go out of business so another place can have a shot at that spot.

I was told by a Chicago native to try this place before they even opened. It has been on my to-try list for over a year and I made it this weekend. Best hot dog I have had in Phoenix. Tried a hamburger, fries and onion rings too. The Jumbo dog was excellent. Juicy without being greasy and I like the Chicago style fixins too.  The hamburger was great. Not a toasted bun, but everything else was perfect.  The Fries are awesome. Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside.  Onion rings were a disappointment in my opinion. Batter to Onion ratio is to high for "my" liking. I will be back.

Found this in my rear view mirror as I was leaving the parking lot.  Turned around and went in to pick up a to go order of Pho. The place is very new and very clean. The staff was very friendly. Pho was excellent. I keep coming back and it is always good. Love the coconut boba.

I picked up carry out on a Sunday afternoon. I was craving Indian food Saturday night and found this place on Yelp. It was the closest Indian restaurant to my house and had good reviews. I was very happy I found them. The staff was very friendly, but I was there for take out and was not waited on. But she seemed attentive to the other seated customers. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Hakka, Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi, and the onion and ratta "condiments?" I thought the food was excellent. I ordered medium hot, but next time will go for hot. I got the eye sweats but not to the levels I seek. The chicken was moist and the Tikka as tasty.Just a little light on the seasonings compared to what I would have made at home. Bottom line is that I really liked the food and will be back.

I gave up on this location. I had the buy one 6" and footlong sub and a 24oz drink coupons and used them all just because it was cheap. But it was exactly that... Cheap. I deconstructed my sandwiches and they all had one layer of paper thin meat. The lettuce had a bitter taste on every order I had. I do not think I will ever go again, coupons or not.

Clean. Service was great. Sushi was good, but not outstanding. It was comparatively priced to other sushi places. The tempura is definitely not the traditional "thin" tempura one should expect. It was pretty thick on both the calamari and vegetable tempura but it was tasty. Will be back for the Chinese entree takeout.

Big Meh!  Way way over priced for what you get.  Nothing special to warrant those prices.  Except the cheese fries. Huge portion would feed two people easily. Basic fries smothered in cheese sauce.  Tried the Houston. Tasted just OK. Again nothing special. The burger was slightly smaller than that place with the famous clown that has a 1/4 lb of meat. Bun was a little dry as well.  The shake was passable, but not ANY better that what that clown serves.  The person at the counter was very courteous and was clearly working hard.   I won't be going back to this place.
