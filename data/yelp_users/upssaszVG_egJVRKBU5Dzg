Giving this theater 4 stars because my first and only experience here was a good one, although a couple things can be improved upon.  First, I went last night with a friend to see "In the Next Room, the Vibrator Play." As you may know or can tell, very adult oriented play. The majority of the laughs were in the first half of the play, but as a whole very amusing, entertaining, great performances and solid writing. It made for a fun start to our Saturday night.  Like most theaters, symphony halls, performance centers, etc., they serve coffee, beer, wine and a few select liquors, which must be consumed before entering the actual theater. Likewise, I love the fact that one can purchase drinks (wine for us) for the intermission and the drinks will be poured and waiting for you without standing in line again. Bonus, considering the intermission may be your only opportunity for a restroom break.  The chairs are very comfortable within the theater and there really is not a bad seat in the house, considering it is a very small theater. I have two complaints, though, which are totally fixable in which case I would easily rank this theater 5 stars...  1) The temperature was very pleasant outside, between say 60 and 65 degrees. Inside, however, we were sweating. It wasn't a dripping sweat but if you choose to "dress up" to go to the theater, you might be uncomfortable, as we were.  2) My second complaint is about the website and the frustration in navigating around to find seating charts that don't suck. Right now it's a crappy, what they consider, 3D seating chart that when clicked on will show you the available seats. The problem is, it doesn't work very well. It's just not clear. It's sad when you google seating charts for the theater and ticket brokers have a better seating diagram than the theater itself. So do yourself a favor and do what I did, find a good seating chart and call the box office. It's quicker and you know exactly what you're getting.  My thoughts on the best seats....the floor seats seem to be good and close. But I chose mezzanine  because I like the looking-down view. If you do choose one of the balconies, I recommend in front of the stage and the 1st row. If you sit on either side of the stage, you'll inevitably end up leaning forward in your seat and resting your elbows on the ledge in front of you to get the best view, doesn't seem that comfy. And I say front row because we sat center stage on the second row and my friend had a hard time seeing over or around the big hair in front of her. Just saying.  Great experience overall. Small venue, has a laid back feel to it with some folks choosing to dress to the 9's while others were comfortably wearing jeans. I'll be keeping my eye out for other plays that might interest me, as I will certainly return to this theater.

Quaint little noodle cafe that can become crowded as there is a steady flow of patrons going in. Sit at a table or the counter, which overlooks the grilling area. The menu is somewhat distinct in that it provides Asian selections as well as Italian pastas. I started with some very tasty spring rolls and went in the Italian direction for my entree. I ordered the spaghetti with olive oil and grilled chicken. Except for the bland, unseasoned chicken the dish was quite flavorful with a bit of kick provided by crushed red pepper.  The server accidently knocked my glass of water over in my direction but he cleaned it up quickly and was very embarrassed about his mistake. Overall the service was great and I expect I will return soon to try the Tempura, which comes highly recommended. I dig the wooden floors too.

I'm gonna add to the growing list of previous reviewers who have also had great service at 25th Street Automotive by giving it a well deserved 5 stars.  My clutch had all but completely gone out and I had to have it towed to the auto shop. The car was also running very hot in an unrelated issue. One of the Bills called me 3 or 4 times throughout the day to keep me in the loop of what they had discovered and what was recommended.  The service was all complete in one day and I was able to pick it up the same evening. My car is running great! Every positive comment about this auto shop is very true. They are professional, extremely courteous, reasonable and above all, they are trustworthy.   A good auto shop is one of those things that seems to be all so elusive, so I'm thankful for the previous yelpers guiding me here. I hope to not have anymore breakdowns or many maintenance needs but if I do, I will return here. I am a fan and I will recommend them to anyone I hear of having a vehicle issue.

On a night where we were just gonna heat up a frozen CPK pizza, and on a whimb, my girl and I decided to hit up La Fontanella instead. I had driven by this place many times and wanted to check it out in hopes of finding a little family owned Italian restaurant.  We could've gone to a multitude of other places that would've been "new" to us both, but I'm so glad we stopped in here. Although, it has been described as a place where you might get dressed up to go to, I found it to be very cozy and casual. It's a converted house with a comfy feeling inside from the color tones to the actual curtains on the windows. We felt right at home.  Looking over the wine list and hearing the specials from the server, we decided on a Malbec because we, well, we both flippin' love Malbecs. Plus, it seemed it would compliment our dishes. My girl got the chicken piccata, which she very much enjoyed, while I got the chicken paillard. Usually, my test for any Italian restaurant is their lasagna but I was in the mood for something different and they totally hit a home run with what I ordered. The thinly pounded chicken breasts tossed about with olive oil, pesto, sun dried tomatoes, olives and capers was beyond flavorful. Everything complimented each other so well, and then....my girlfriend drizzled some of her white wine/lemon/butter sauce onto my plate and JESUS CHRIST!!! it was so insane!! So we just sorta combined our two dishes and proceeded to mow through our meals, barely making sure we saved enough room for dessert.  We easily could've ordered 3 or 4 of the dessert offerings without the slightest argument from each other but prudently, we settled on one to share, the cannoloni. Not too much to say about this. It was good, except for the almond slivers on one end of it. Oddly enough, they tasted a bit fishy. Whatever, all in all it was still a nice way to finish our meal and the rest of our wine.  So before I wrap this up, I have to mention the one thing that impressed me the most, the reason for the 5th star. Right in the center of the dining area, they had merged a couple tables together for a larger group of 6 or so. When all their meals were ready, the server brought out the plates except for one. A gentleman at the head of the table ordered the dover sole and that particular dish was brought out by the chef. Right beside the table, the chef meticulously took the fish apart, delicately removed all the bones in one piece, reassembled the meal and then served it up. This, my friends, may be a common occurence for some of you but I had never seen it and I thought it was a very classy touch.  I've already told a handful of friends and coworkers about La Fontanella and the fact that I can't wait to return so I can sample some of their other dishes and especially the other desserts. MMMMMMMM...

This is my dry cleaner of choice! When I first moved to Phoenix three years ago, I set out to find a dry cleaner that wasn't gonna break me. Sadly, most of them here in the valley do have outrageous prices, and for what? I tried a lot of them and I never really saw the value.  Thankfully I just happened upon Park Avenue Cleaners and I've never looked back. The employees are always extremely friendly and the prices per piece whether laundered or dry cleaned are very reasonable. I've taken everything here from dress shirts and slacks to ties with stains and even my comforter. Everything has come back better than before and extra points for not returning my shirts with broken buttons, which I'm guessing is the result from over-steaming them.  I've recently moved, and Park Avenue Cleaners is no longer convenient but that's not gonna stop me from going out of my way to continue to use their services. Top notch!

This place is a joke if they think they compare to any sort of respectable wine bar. If this comment offends you, feel free to pull down your pants and start crying now.   After looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab. I was happy to learn that half the proceeds went to the cure for Autism until i realized that the waitstaff could have used the money, as they all had some special needs of their own.   In an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.    The Tomato/Basil/Mozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf?), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers? Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality.   Thankfully the music became the highlight of the evening. If it weren't for the 2-man, live band playing a lively rendition of MyGirl in the corner, I don't know if we would have survived the evening ;)

Newbie to the Elliot / 48th Street area...so on a whim decided to check out Los Taquitos. I played it simple and ordered the #1, which is 3 street tacos with beans and rice. Took it home and mowed, I repeat, MOWED it down! I got one chicken taco and two carne asada and they were equally delicious. The refried beans and rice were fresh and authentic and, lucky for me, served together in a separate container, which made mixing them extremely easy.   My only complaint is that I loathe all varieties of onions, especially finely chopped red onions. So I specifically requested no onions, then I made the mistake of not checking before bolting out the door. Of course, since I got my tacos to go, once I got home I found finely chopped onions on 'em. The kind that would take 3 days to pick out, so I just ate 'em. Still amazing!   There are a lot of cool little local eateries in this area and this one definitely ranks at the top for me. I'll be planning many return trips to sample some of the other things on their menu.

Overall, a fan of REI, and this location has always served me well. The employees have always been nice and helpful and, of course, I'm a big fanatic of the co-op aspect. I've spent a good amount of coin at REI, like a lot of people have, and I've even considered getting a side job here just to supplement what I'm spending. That would just get me in trouble though.  So I'm finally writing a review after spending countless hours in this store. Why finally? I don't know. There's really nothing I'm gonna say that hasn't already been said but I had a really great experience this past week that I wanted to share. The tent I've been using for 15+ years finally busted on me. I want a new tent but it just ain't in the budget, not the one I want, at least. So I decided to rent one from REI. Picked it up Friday and dropped it off Sunday. I had rented a really decent 3 person tent, with footprint, easy to set up, for 19 bucks. Total. I was surprised how economical it is to rent a tent. TENT RENTERS! hahaha. I guess I'm one of them now!   I buy shoes, flippies, clothes and bike gear (a sh*t ton of tubes) from this location and every time is a pleasant experience. The only thing that sticks in my side, is the price of some of the shirts they sell. I mean, who is spending $60 on a shirt that's gonna get faded/stained by the Arizona sun and if they're lucky, ripped to shreds, cuz they're doing something really awesome and exciting?! Hmmm....I'll take it!!

Anyone driving out here for the first time should know that once you exit the highway, there aren't any gas stations. I nearly ran out of gas because I didn't know I was gonna end up way out in the boonies. I mean, where do all the farmers out here get their fuel?  As for the zoo itself, there are some animals that you won't see at the phoenix zoo and of course there's the aquarium but I don't really think I'll be going back. The reason I came here to begin with was so my girlfriend could see some penguins. I have to remind myself that we do live in the desert but the penguin exhibit was really sad. It's very small and although the entire front of it is glass, the entire area quickly fills up with children, obstructing the view.  I think instead of driving from the east valley, next time I'll make the trek up to Out of Africa, which I've heard is quite an experience.

This is some bomb ass ice cream! I was raised on blue bell old fashioned vanilla ice cream and the home made sort that families would take to the park for a picnic. Mary Coyle was a nice surprise to say the least.  The rocky road that I got was by far the best I'd ever had. My girl got the honey banana in a waffle cone and that one completely blew me away. For some reason, I thought the honey would be overwhelming but not so much-it was very subtle, in a smooth kinda way. After mowing down as much of mine as I could and then leaning over to grab a few bites of hers, I was literally stupefied....meaning, I could barely speak, much less uncross my eyes. I'm certain it'll be a long time before my girl stops laughing about my reaction but it will not be long before I make a return trip to Mary Coyle's.

Very professional staff and clean facility. I actually hadn't given blood in over a year because the location that was convenient for me (McClintock and McDowell) had closed and this location just seemed too far. Fortunately, the good people at UBS will frequently give you a courtesy call if they have your number.  Quick and painless. Now that I'm back on track, I'll continue to come here for my donations.

One of my absolute favorite spring training ballparks! I'm attempting to get to all of the ballparks here in the valley and that's kinda hard to do with ballparks like this one that make you wanna return again and again!  The concessions wrap nearly all the around the small and intimate field. They have a good selection of food and beer. The craft brew bombers are definitely the way to go for value and quality!  And bonus: you can park nearly anywhere around old town and catch the free trolley to the ballpark. After the game you can wander around and check out some of the nearby bars / restaurants.  How can you not have a good time at this ballpark?!

Now I'm no Tom Selleck, but I'm quite convinced that my girl and I were the best looking people in this bar the night we went. And maybe that's not even a far stretch. Seems a call went out prior to the Old 97's show, calling for all the tallest and ugliest people in all of Arizona. Jeez, what a poor showing.  The Old 97's put on a kickass show, as they usually do. But this was not the venue for them. This venue is better served as a place for local bands that don't draw big crowds.  And to the older fat bastard that shimmied his way to center stage, in front of me.....get a life man. There's never any need to take your $2000 camera to a show, zoom in on the singer's face and proceed to snap 300 photos. Take your man crush somewhere else.  Oh and the drinks are expensive too.

Bought my starter homebrew kit from here a few months ago and have made several more trips since, as well as a few batches. Everyone is very knowledgeable, but more importantly, extremely friendly and eager to share with you what they know about brewing. I've even had another customer share his clone hoegaarden recipe with me, which the employee gladly copied for me.  They seem to have pretty much everything you need, including a really thick book of recipes. My only complaint is that their prices for equipment, in particular, are significantly higher than other places I've seen online. So, you either support a local business with friendly staff and a wealth of knowledge or shop online to save a little money. I guess it just depends on the scenario but I will definitely continue to come here for all things beer, wine, even hard cider homebrewing-related!

Never a disappointing experience here! I've been frequenting this local joint, primarily for breakfast, the entire 3 years I've lived here in the Tempe / Phoenix area. I love introducing friends to Harlow's as well because inevitably they become hooked too.  There are a couple downsides to this place, if you even wanna call them that: 1) limited parking can make it very frustrating to find a spot and 2) the prices are a little bit higher than what you'll pay at places like Denny's, Ihop or 5 and Diner. But those places suck anyway, so it's totally worth paying a little more for better food and better ambiance.  Some favorites are the blueberry pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. The thick cut bacon is delicious too!  Went here today for breakfast and I just might have to go again tomorrow!

It's frustrating that Mexican food is SO regional in style and flavor. Having lived in Texas for most of my life I am accustomed to Tex-Mex. So naturally, I haven't had much luck finding any Mexican food that reminds me of home. However, of the many restaurants that I have tried here in the valley, this one has been the closest and the best...so far.  The dish that I got could've served two people but the idea was to try a variety . The tamale was very good and the cheese enchilada was surprisingly even better. And being someone who never raves about Mexican rice, it feels a little weird saying that their rice stole the show. It was very good. Overall I was happy with the quality and taste.   I dropped in for lunch on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily there was an open area at the bar, where they had NFL games on 3 or 4 tv's. The bartender was extremely attentive, never letting my coke sit half empty and refilling my chips bowl a couple times, as well. I will return!

Went here with a friend who had been raving about their 'gourmet' pizza for months. She only knew of the one in Mesa but I stumbled upon this one while out for a ride on my bike, motor-less. Decided to take her there for a couple reasons a) cuz she's pretty cool and b) cuz if I don't like it I can totally rip on her and her tastes.  But dang! I really loved this place! So what if I'm in search of the best pizza in a city new to me? This pizza was so good I couldn't even bother comparing it to my fave 'back home.'   We split a chicken caesar salad. The dressing was tasty and I really enjoyed the pulled-style all white chicken. Then onto the pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I loved how thin and crispy it was, the pepperoni was of really exceptional quality but it literally comes down to the sauce. Yeah, it's not just a catchy name for the joint; it makes the pizza!  My only complaint would be the selection of beer. Wine is becoming more and more accessible and I can totally get on board with the idea of wine and pizza or wine and just about anything else, but sometimes I want a beer. They have maybe 6 brands of beer and some are totally appropriate, such as Peroni. I just would like to have seen a bigger selection.  And I think someone else has mentioned the fact that the restroom is very small; true. It wasn't crowded when we were there so I think I'd be pissed if I'd been drinking and it was crowded and I did need to go. Other than that, I really dig this place and can totally see myself going back for a casual dinner or even making the little trek for lunch.

My girlfriend suggested that we come here for brunch and I'm glad we did. The whole layout of the restaurant is nice and they did a great job with the decor.  It was a bit odd starting with bread and pesto and then eating breakfast but that's what you get when you sit down and the pesto was just so good! As for my meal, I had the french toast which came with delicious compote and warm syrup. This was probably the best french toast I've ever had that wasn't home made. Add a side of crispy applewood smoked bacon and I was in heaven. If I only come back to Olive & Ivy for brunch I'll be happy but I hope to make it back for lunch or dinner sometime as well.

made a stop in here last night via the Tuesday Trolley (which might I add, is a brilliant idea!). this was my first time to The Vig. We sat outside on a chilly night and enjoyed the KICKASS patio with a little heat from the propane heater next to our table. fantastic ambiance and the best part was the dj mixing some hip hop while another dude played a trumpet and guitar during certain parts. what a classy touch! we all loved it so much! the beverages were good and the service was as well. i can't believe i'd never been here before but i am a fan i will be returning!

I'm like some who don't quite understand the cupcake craze. A small little store that does nothing but cupcakes seems a little bizarre to me. I mean where are all the pie-only boutiques?  Anyway, my girl friend loves cupcakes, especially red velvet. Since we were riding our bikes along the greenbelt here, we stopped in to check it out. Right off the bat, we discover that they don't make red velvet cupcakes because they do not use artificial ingredients. I get it. But after the sucky cupcakes we had, they should reconsider.  My girlfriend had the Pucker Up. The only hint of lemon was the actual lemon wedge that was stuck in the hockey puck of icing sitting on top of the cupcake. She hated it and after only one bite it ended up in the trash can with a thud!  I went with the Blonde Bombshell and although I wouldn't go so far to say it was inedible, it absolutely was not worth $3. It was very bland and crumbly. The icing itself, I thought should've been a sweet buttery flavor, actually had a sour taste to it so I scraped off as much of it as I could.  Someone else on here, prior to my write-up, had yelped something to the effect of taking the $3 and going for a happy hour beer....my girlfriend and I agree that we should've walked over to Duke's for a pitcher. It would've been much more rewarding after a bike ride than a couple crappy cupcakes.

The first time I had a pasty was while I was in Bath, not far from Stonehenge. Fast forward a few years, I'm told of Cornish Pasty Co. Dang, these things are the best! I typically call in my order and by the time I arrive (10-15 mins.) it is all ready for me to take home. Oddly, I usually do this on days when I'm hurting from a terrible hangover. Their menu, which is available online, has so many options and they all seem freaking incredible. However, when I'm hungover I usually want something very filling and comforting. So the very first pasty I called in was a shepherd's pie, then I'm asked if I want lamb (a true shepherd's pie) or beef (a cottage pie). Lamb, of course! It was so delicious it's the only one I've ever gotten. I just can't seem to bring myself to deviate and that's not really like me, especially when everyone raves about all the others. Someday. I'll surely be going back, maybe one day I'll actually eat there and enjoy the ambiance and maybe, just maybe I'll try something new. This place rocks! The service is great and they're all so friendly!

My friend and I wanted pizza last night and Oregano's had a crazy long line, so we ended up here at Boston's. Neither of us are hardcore UFC followers, so we weren't aware of the big fight night going on last night. We were asked if outside was okay and because the weather right now is too amazing to be indoors, I agreed to sit on the patio....until we got to our table, which was in the very furthest corner where a couple of guys were hovering, smoking freshly-lit cigars. I'm not a smoker, so it always irritates me that sitting outside is not an option, unless you enjoy inhaling second hand smoke. But what are you gonna do? It's not like they can smoke anywhere else, so I get it, just don't wanna be a part of it while eating.  So, the wait for a table inside began. We should've driven to Barro's or something but we were already there and figured, what the hell. The hostess, Alyssa, was super sweet and so genuinely apologetic for us having to wait. She found a table for us, sat us, cleaned the surface, took our drink order and even our food order. She was trying so hard to please every customer she encountered. However, one particular manager (his accent sounded Russian to us) was constantly in her face, critiquing everything she was doing. After our order was put in, he came to our table and explained that Boston's had spent $4800 to broadcast the fight and that we had to spend $15 minimum each. "You understand," he says, with his sweaty palm on my back. Fuckin' gross! I told him that I did understand, but we were there to eat, there was no signage explaining this, nor were we told upfront...."so it's not my problem."  Our waitress (pretty sure her name was Brittany) came over after and explained that she wasn't concerned about a minimum. She was very pleasant and attentive to every detail.  I'm giving this crappy place 2 stars because the service from the two lovely ladies who helped us actually made the experience worthwhile. The manager was a dick and the pepperoni pizza was definitely not gourmet. We had chicken nachos as an app, though and they were not bad at all.  So to sum up: nachos=good. The waitstaff was awesome. Pizza=very sucky. And during a UFC event, the noise level is deafening.

Being from Texas, and having moved to the Phoenix area about a year ago, I am always on the hunt for good bbq. "Back home" we are blessed with the most amazing bbq of Rudy's. A friend of mine from Tennessee, who has lived in Phoenix now for about 4 years, introduced me to Kinfolk's and I was pleased. Everything that the 5 star reviews say is true of this place. The portions are huge, the prices are decent and whether you like the brisket or the pulled pork (sorry, never tried the ribs), this bbq is the best I've had in Arizona. If I had written a review for this place just a week ago, I would probably have given it 4 stars.  After my second attempt to take my girlfriend here and not getting to eat, we will not be going back. I was always impressed with the older guy running the place, pretty much solo, other than the cooking. He takes your order, he brings you out the food and he rings you up. The problem I've always had is his grumpiness. Well, on Saturday he went a little too far. When we arrived at 7:45 p.m. and saw the closing time on the door, I wasn't particularly certain what it read. Plus I was craving some Kinfolk's. We went inside and there were still a lot of people eating so I thought we were safe. When I began pouring my own drink (as you do), the older man told me they were about to close and that it "better" be to go. I apologized for coming in so close to closing time but explained that it looked like the 8 on the door was scratched to look like a 9 OR that the 9 looked like it was filled in with liquid paper to look like an 8. Either way, I wasn't sure but I was hopeful. He then began to argue with me. He was totally out of line. He could've politely told me that they were about to close and that I could get something to go and I would've been happy. Instead he chose to be a shithead and in turn, drive me to go to a chain bbq restaurant (Famous Dave's, not too bad plus they serve beer). I've since sought out another decent place in Dickey's BBQ, off Shea in Scottsdale.  Sadly, Kinfolk's is still the best bbq I've had here in the Phoenix area. I will not, however, give my hard earned money in this tough economy to a grumpy, broken body, old man that cannot be bothered to be polite. Good luck keeping your small business going during this recession when people like myself are being more choosy about where to spend our money.

so i've been here a couple times now and i'm only writing this because i am definitely a fan of this place. i've only gotten the chicken pesto panini but it's just so damn good, i can't bring myself to try anything else. this, however, ain't exactly healthy for you as it's loaded down with pesto and feta AND it's served up on some texas toast! damn! my friend has gotten a few different things including some kinda turkey wrap and a club sandwich. they were both very good too!  parking and seating can be tough during lunch-i've warned you!  bonus points for being locally owned.

I like this place a lot. I will say that it is not the cheapest steak house by any means but considering what you get, it is well worth it. As others have said, the view is amazing. Since it is situated south of Phoenix, it offers a unique view of a big part of the valley, with all the downtown skyline (what there is of it) all lit up at night. It's quite impressive to see from this vantage point.  My girlfriend wanted to treat her friend to a birthday dinner and T-Bone's was his choice. Everyone raves about Durant's and seeing as how she worked there for about 3 years, she's got a pretty good idea of what's what. She prefers T-Bone's for the value, among other things. She got the filet, her friend got the porterhouse and I got the NY strip. The birthday boy really enjoyed his porterhouse-all of it. I thought my strip was just so-so. It was cooked just as specified (the best part was the crispy searing on the outside and the inside was just perfect). I just wasn't blown away by the flavor or the cut. The winner of it all was definitely the filet. She ordered it medium rare, and although i prefer it cooked a little more, maybe medium, it was just perfect. The outside was crispy and when you put it in your mouth it almost melted just like butter. Incredible.  We followed it up with a slice of apple pie a la mode and some kind of brownie dessert. They were both very decadent.  I like this place because it offers a unique view of the valley, because of the overall quality of the food and because of the rustic feel of it all. I was surprised to see that on a Friday it wasn't completely packed out at 7 p.m. but there was a steady flow of meat lovers.  There is a full bar toward the back that is actually more lit up than the dining area. Fatty steaks freaks me out and for anyone else that has this same weird problem, the lack of lighting can make it difficult to be sure that you've trimmed off every morsel of fat from the steak. However, I gotta say I like how low lit this joint is, what with the saw dust on the floor and all.  I will absolutely be returning as soon as I can and this time I will be ordering the filet.

So I don't smoke weed or cigarettes but occasionally I do like to bust out my Hookah or Shisha when my friends are over. I was introduced to the Hookah almost 10 years ago and over the past year I have developed a renewed interest in it.  My friends and I have stopped in at Coughing Canary (the Smoke Shop) a handful of times to pick up some tobacco and charcoal. We've never been disappointed....although on 2 separate occasions while smoking in my living room, I dumped over the Hookah and spilled the lit coals, burning my carpet. Dang. That's my fault. Maybe with the cooler weather I'll figure out a set-up on my patio.  Last night we ran up to Coughing Canary again for the usual and to try some new flavors. The guy working there was so concerned with his mobile that he was really of no help at all. Also, we wanted to buy a second hose for my Hookah, but I noticed that the only adaptor he showed me was too large in diameter to fit mine. He assured me it was universal. Well it didn't work. I went back today, just sure as hell that I was gonna have to become irate because the 2 pieces I bought were useless. On the contrary, I was told that the store was under new ownership and they are determined to elevate their customer service. (The guy from last night wasn't there today.) So, they made it right. Kickass!  When I can afford it, I plan on upgrading to a better quality Hookah and this will more than likely be where I buy it. Until then, my friends and I will continue buying our tobacco and tobacco accessories from Coughing Canary!

I almost dropped my review to 4 stars because service was a little slow but then something occurred to me. Fast sit-down service is so American. It's customary for us to order an appetizer, shovel it down quickly before the salad comes and mow down the salad before your entree arrives.  Sometimes it's okay to sit down, relax and enjoy your food as much as you do your company.  The service might have been a little slow (one person waiting on 5 or 6 tables and taking care of the take out orders) but our server was extremely courteous. And the food, oh damn, the food was sooo good. I can highly recommend the lamb roast served over rice and the chicken shawarma dinner plate served with rice. Both very delicious.  Sahara is a little bit of a drive but I will most certainly be returning. MMMMMMMMmmmmmmm!

Draw 10 has been the go-to bar for my friends and me for the past couple years. With the new owner taking over sometime last year, it's gotten considerably better. They proudly offer a good selection of local/Arizona craft beers on tap, as well as a nice selection of regional craft beers in bottles/cans.  Like others have said, the drink prices are super low, the food has a unique twist thanks to the chef, Mel and the service from the bartenders is impeccable.  So whether you're attending a spring training game at the nearby Oakland A's ballpark, jumping off the light rail or you're like me and can stumble home from this bar, it's definitely a super chill place where you can hang with your friends, maybe shoot some pool, load up on the jukebox and have a great time!

Not sure why it took me so long to try the green chili mac n cheese but it is insane! As good as the pulled pork sliders are, I think I have my new go-to. So if you can handle a little spice, do yourself a favor and get this!

this review is more of an update of one of my longtime goto neighborhood bars. i've come out of my dormant state to make a few points of why i won't be spending as much time here any longer. 1) i dearly loved drinking local craft beer out of a 32 ounce mug. sadly, i recently learned these great mugs have been replaced with 26 ounce mugs. my problem is i'm paying the same price for A LOT less beer...and i wasn't told. 2) after years and years of enjoying delicious meals here, i had never once complained about a meal prior to recently. it was a legitimate complaint and when i brought it to my bartender's attention, i got pushback and that made me feel like a bad guy. 3) just doesn't have the same "local bar" feel anymore. the food is still great and they still have a great local craft beer selection.

I love this little pub. I love it for it's location / proximity to the ballpark and within walking distance to other establishments. I love this place for it's quaint-ness and the fact that as soon as you walk like 4 feet through the doorway, you can order a beverage. I love this place for the simple fact that it was one of the first bars/pubs I went to with friends when I first moved here (insert nostalgia). I love the beer selection (local brew on tap) + half off burger Mondays + $3 breakfasts after 10 on Sunday (also bloody marys and mimosas for the same price).  My only complaint is directed at myself for not being available to go to the Rose and Crown every Sunday morning!!

To me, there are few things more difficult than leaving your barber, mechanic and dentist and moving to a new town...having to look for replacements. I've tried out just about every barber shop I've driven by and even several that I've read about on yelp. Some have not been too terribly bad and some have just really sucked.   I settled on one that is relatively close to where I live (name withheld) because it had the old school barber shop feel and, although I couldn't understand the guy, he always gave me a good cut. But after awhile, I could no longer deal with his thanksgiving stuffing breath...you know, with the onions. I would literally time my breathing so that I would exhale the same time as he would so that I would not be able to smell it. Holy moly it was awful!  So while working in the Chaparral area, I did a quick google search for nearby barber shops and the Pavillion Barber Shop came up. They actually list the prices on their website, which I thought were a little high. But then I realized that they have a printable coupon on the website for a discount. So that's good yeah? Plus, it is Scottsdale and sometimes you just have to accept slightly higher prices. So I gave it a shot and I can honestly say that it was the best haircut and best barber shop experience I've had in Phoenix. And yes, you get the straight-blade razor as well as a hot towel.   I've since been back a couple times and even if it means driving across town, I will happily for a great haircut. The same two gentlemen (Phil is one of them) are always there and I've gotten the same treatment and results from them both. They're really nice and genuinely appreciated my business.  Check 'em out!

I'm writing this review today without having read any previous reviews of this place. I did not seek it out, rather stopped in for lunch today because my girlfriend had been here many times and suggested it.  To start with, I don't throw 5 stars out there very often. Actually, I don't think anyone does. However, this place is such a little gem I believe that it deserves high marks for the service they offer.  My girlfriend and I each got a chicken taco and a carne asada taco. Let me just say that the portions alone, for 2 bucks a pop, are more than average. Add on top of that, the fact that they come stacked with rice and beans and loads of cheese and you've got a great bargain. I will say that I did not enjoy the chicken taco quite as much as I did the carne asada, which means I will probably just stick with the latter in the future.   I had the privilege of meeting the owner as he stopped by our table to talk with us a bit about some of the changes he's made (more shade on the patio, misting system, etc.) and the newest addition to his restaurants, a breakfast joint, which he says will open sometime in mid July 09 and seat around 100. This is good news, I think, because there is not much seating here or at his burger joint. And although, they have no problem packing them in, even during these hard times, he was very grateful to be doing so well and hoped to see us again. He was very pleasant to talk to and also very accessible.  So let's talk about the service itself. You might think that a little dive place like this, selling $2 tacos (or 3 for $5) might just want to take your order and push you on through like cattle, trying to serve as many people as possible with very little personality or courtesy. That could not be further from reality here. The kid taking our order at the register apologized for blinking too much, saying that the grill was kicking out a little more smoke than usual. Another kid who brought our tacos outside to us was very polite, to the extent of saying thank you for coming and how they appreciate our business. Now c'mon, these are just kids. Usually you would expect quite the opposite but we felt very welcome.  The menu consisted of all sorts of tacos, burritos and even hot dogs. It seems they had an extensive assortment of lemonades, as well but we chose sodas. Parking is limited. The order comes out very quickly and for all of this, I love this place and will be returning.  It's great to have a restaurant like this that is locally owned, very easy on the wallet AND the food is delicious! I would encourage anyone to stop in and see for themselves. Maybe we'll see ya there!

I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.  Wine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!  Someday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!

So this update is long overdue, since I've been here several more times in the last year and half since my initial review. I dropped my rating for a couple reasons.   Two things people rave about are the goblets and the food. Well the goblets are only good ice cold and it really sucks when you're served a beer in one that is room temp and then you see someone else getting one immediately after you, in an ice cold one. Is it because they're a regular and know the bartender by name and know their life story? I'm not sure. But wouldn't an icy goblet served to a non-regular be a good way to entice them to become a regular?   As for the food, it is pretty good for the most part. Above average for bar food. But I expect that here because it is more than just a bar. Families come here for dinner, which is why there's a separate dining room. The edamame is delicious. Sliders are good. Pizza is just average, but the thing that really threw me off were the chicken tenders. They had to have been the worst I've ever had. It wasn't even real chicken. It was merely pressed meat. You can get better ones at a fast food place.   However, I love that they have Abita Turbo Dog, among other beers. And that it's a place to cheer for the New Orleans Saints. Now if they had a good cup of seafood gumbo..........

Not too much going on here. It's not my style to compare a pizza place to Slices but that's kinda what it felt like here....only not as good. Feels weird saying that. I had a couple slices of pepperoni, which, here it comes, tasted like cardboard. and my girl had a slice of sausage and pepperoni and some kind of square margarita pizza without marinara, which was their only saving grace. It was actually pretty good.  There are too many other dining options in this area. But if I'm in the mood for sub par pizza by the slice, I might stop back in.

I like this place. My friends and I have off-and-on frequented this place for the past year and we've never been disappointed. While they'll continue to truck their staple brews up from the Bisbee location, they are finally brewing small batches here in Tempe.  Only a couple blocks down from the always busy Mill, Dave's Electric is a nice change of pace with a chill patio, never overly crowded (if you're day drinking, you might be one of only a few people here) and the waitstaff are pretty awesome!  My favorite beer is the OK Ale and the pretzel bites are good little snackers.

Some friends and I had driven past this brewery several times, wondering when it would finally open. On a whim, last night we called and found out they had been open for just over a week so we decided to stop in. We stayed for about 2 hours and had such a great time talking to the owner and brewmaster, Rob.  Just to set it straight, this is a brewery first and foremost. There is ample seating throughout the open design, including some luxurious and not-yet-beer-stained couches and enough room for about a dozen beer lovers to belly-up. Since they have only been open for 10 days at this point, it was disappointingly not packed out at all. I realize that Four Peaks is just down the road, but that place is usually over crowded to the point one might think some patrons would wander this way to check out Sleepy Dog.  Each of us started off with a flight of their 5 currents beers. The samples were a nice size and it only cost $3 per flight. That's amazing to me! These were the beer types: Pilsner, Hefe, Pale, Irish Ale and a Scottish Ale. They were all very good for their respective beer types. As my buddies both agreed on the Hefe for their ensuing pints, I favored the Scottish Ale. While we sipped on our brews, the bartender, Jen, prepared our nachos and hotdogs and made sure we did not run out of our beverages. Rob, graciously unfolded the story behind the Sleepy Dog name (sorry, you'll have to go to find out for yourself) and how he started brewing in his home until he became serious about it and went to school, as well as travelled abroad and throughout the states, picking up experience and touring breweries.  From the bar, it is wide open into the brewery itself, so you can see where your beer came from. Rob mentioned that on Sundays they are giving tours of the facility, will have beer specials and throughout football season he will have many of the games on. He saved no expense on the flat screens...they're very nice. And because they are a microbrewery and not a brewpub, he encourages people to bring their own food if they like. Their short menu is just enough for someone who is really hungry or just wants nachos and/or a hotdog. Very soon we should also begin to see other brewerys' beers on tap as well as a cold box with bottles or cans of other varieties.  The beer was delicious-bottom line. I believe they're cooking up an IPA as well as another type, that should be ready in a couple weeks. Sleepy Dog Brewing provides their beer to many restaurants and other brewpubs around the Phoenix area. Although, it is not your typical growler, they do provide a unique receptacle for taking beer to go and they sell kegs, with a very modestly priced deposit.  I hope to see twice as many people in here next time I go, which will be soon. And I hope that people really get behind this local microbrewery. I know we are. Cheers.

Came here on a Friday night and we really enjoyed ourselves. Nice atmosphere, not too stuffy....one guy even looked as if he had just came from the gym, but you could definitely dress up a little if you want. It was cozy inside and the patio looked enjoyable as well. Our server, Tony, was attentive and he even waved the corking fee for our first bottle since it was our first time here. This inevitably led to a second bottle. The selection of wine is pretty good and they're one of, if not the only, bar/bistro where I've seen the delicious Australian beer Cooper's.  We didn't eat much, just nibbled on the sweet potato fries and an order of hummus. Both were very good. I'd like to go back and sample the kangaroo sliders and sit on the patio while the weather is still cool enough.  Definitely a nice find on the east side of the valley!

Decided to hit up a hookah bar on Halloween night so we made the short trek from Boulder's over to Al Omda. First time there, heck, first time going to a hookah bar in Arizona, and we couldn't have had a better experience. Moe is extremely nice and very attentive. I'm not a connoisseur or anything so I appreciate someone stopping by to check how well it's still smoking.   We had the strawberry kiwi blend and it was really smooth and tasty. I also had an Egyptian tea that was quite tasty. Overall, we were there for about 2 hours.  No alcohol served here, nor can you bring your own. Not sure if that's an Arizona law or not but it would be nice if it was BYOB.  Prices are really decent, Al Omda is really close to home and Moe made it a great experience. We will return with more friends!

Nice not-so-little boutique with lots of stuff. There is a broad range of pricing from low to high and everything seems to be at a valued price.  I can see coming here, if in the area, for something unique and specialized as a gift.  Nicely air conditioned, too, during the scorchin' hot summer! That's a bonus!

I've heard some people really rave about this place. They were so excited went Jimmy John's came to the valley. My review is based on a single experienced but it was definitely sub par.   Am I the only one that has had a need for napkins or extra condiments? With the 7, count 'em, 7 kids in the sandwich preparation area and maybe 3 customers I was confused why when my girlfriend asked for napkins at the register, the girl told her they were at the other end.....literally like 5 feet away. So we walked 5 feet down and asked a different girl standing there and received napkins.  Went outside, sat down and realized there wasn't mustard on my sandwich. Went back inside and asked for some, "We don't have any." Yeah they don't have any salt, pepper, mayo, mustard or any self serve condiments. You have to get those things when it's being made. Weak.   The bread was fresh, everything was really, but it was no where near an amazing sandwich. I'll probably try it out again but at least I'll know what I'm getting, an okay sandwich.

I've been to a few of the valley Zipps and this one is probably my favorite. Went there last night with a handful of friends. The service was great. Our server was really attentive and had a good sense of humor. And when she was too busy to drop off our drinks, another server was coming by with them. Top notch.  And I had the pleasure of destroying a basket of chicken skewers! Dang those are so good! They're different than most chicken strips/fingers in that they're not overly battered. For a strip of fried chicken, they're surprisingly light.  Decor is pretty nice, brick walls all around. Partition between bar area and sit-down area. And it's nice that there's a good mix of people. This location is a bit of a drive from my house but I will definitely stop in again when in the area.

My review is a bit overdue seeing as how we actually ordered from Naked Pizza a few weeks ago.  Had some friends over for game 7 of the NBA finals and had been wanting to try out this place. So we called in an order and brought it back. We ordered the Mediterranean, the Farmvil and a plain cheese pizza. We weren't given a crust option so thin is what we got, paper thin.  The ingredients were all really good quality. But the sauce didn't really stand out, and to me, that's the most crucial ingredient.  There's really nothing else in the immediate area to compete with Naked Pizza, business-wise, but I don't really think this place will be a huge success. I'll probably give it another go sometime down the line, but a couple nights ago I opted to drive a little bit out of the way for a better pie, and better value. It's a bit overpriced for what you're getting.

I have a new go-to! This is bbq done right!  My first visit here I got some chopped beef, lean sliced brisket, a link of sausage, cole slaw and a slice of pecan pie.  The chopped beef made a delicious sandwich (for the record, a 1/2 lb of chopped beef makes 2 hefty sandwiches for less $ than most bbq joints charge for 1) but the star here was the lean brisket. Might be too dry for some but I prefer mine super lean cuz you can always add some sauce to it. They do have moist brisket as well.  The sausage was tasty too and I can't wait to see what the jalapeno version is doing.  Top notch quality and for a price that isn't gonna hurt your wallet. Proof that a lot of valley bbq restaurants are charging too much.  To put it plain and simple, THIS BBQ IS LARAPIN!  Oh yeah, cash only.

my roommate and i had the good fortune of attending the grand opening last night and besides a few kinks that need working out, this place is (gonna be) awesome. our server, kaycee (sp?), was extremely polite and attentive and definitely added to the overall experience. for that alone, i'll return. but there are other reasons...  i like the hanging bike hooks along the outside perimeter of the whole establishment, but beyond that, i didn't see anything else that makes this place bicycle friendly or to even go along with the name "The Handlebar." i hope they add to it.  the beer selection was great, a little bit for everyone. i was happy to see delerium tremens on tap, among others. and i'm happy that our server recommended a bottle of Rochefort 8, as it was too delicious to not sip and savor. moreover, i'm looking forward to seeing what all local beers will be on tap in the future. the buyer has his work cut out for him to keep the beer list interesting, being just about a  block away from world of beer. he's doing a great job so far!  as far as the environment goes, i loved the semi rustic feel to it, the communal tables and the wood/steel everywhere. it's pretty cool that some walls are coated with chalkboard that they write on to update the blown kegs and what's replacing them. sadly, the patio didn't have quite the chill vibe i was hoping for, mainly due to the music. pumping beats doesn't exactly separate you from what every other bar on mill is doing. hopefully, this was only due to it being the grand opening.  all in all, i'm very much anticipating cooler weather so i can ride my bike down here, sit on the patio and enjoy some tasty brew!

Based on previous reviews and my lack of bakery knowledge, I purchased a Red Velvet cake for my girlfriend's birthday. I had never tried this type of cake before, so I have nothing to compare it to, BUT is was a huge success. You can call in a special order, or like me, you can just show up and purchase one of their bundt cakes, as is. One thing that I wish I had known before hand is that they have mini bundt cakes that cost around 4 bucks each. I almost wish I had bought several of the minis, that way we could've tried multiple flavors, such as carrot, pineapple upside down, the red velvet, some sort of white cake as well as a chocolate cake.  As it were, the birthday girl served up slices of the Red Velvet cake to friends and everyone loved it. One even exclaimed that it was the best ever. I will purchase cakes from here every single time there is a need, or even when there is not a need but we're craving some yummy cake.
