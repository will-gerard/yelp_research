Ok...Always prided myself on being the type of person who enjoyed the fresh air instead of being a hamster on a wheel in "some" gym.  Well, a visible weight gain, and it turns out that Whitney doesn't enjoy working out.  That is until I went to the Village Health Club.  I was lucky enough to snag free passes from my parents who are avid members.  I always had wondered why they go so often.  After my first visit, I now see why! the place is beautiful.  The location is really spaced out well so that there might be tons of people there, but it never feels crowded.  And ever member of the Village Team are so nice and welcoming.  The front desk person today really helped me out.  I hadn't quite got my barrings of the location but she gave me turn by turn directions to my spin class (which was a butt kicker in a great way).   I can't wait to go back and enjoy more classes.  You have got to stop in and enjoy this place.  This is place has earned the title health club.  It was absolutely amazing!

In the very great and wise words of my father "Holy Crap That's Good!". There is no wiser sentence that can describe how amazing this place is! One of my dear friends took me to this place that he knew about. It apparently is the "IT" place to go in Vegas. I had my doubts.  We drove up to the place and it looked a little dumpy (apparently this is a sign of a great place to eat). There wasn't much on the wall except for a menu with about 30 different subs. I allowed my friend to order for me since it seemed like he knew what the best thing to get was. He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian.  The kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest "medium" sub I had ever seen.  When I took my first bite it was to die for! It was not a sandwich for the dainty. The sandwich got all over the place and was the best sandwich I had ever eaten! I had never eaten a sandwich with Cole slaw on it, but it is something to be tried.  I declare that everyone needs to eat here!

My friend Charles T. has told me over and over again that I had to come with him to experience "Real" Vegas as he calls it. This was one of his local spots that he stays.  By the website the Artisan looked cool. Dark and artsy hotel. Show me something else I haven't seen...But believe me this place is way better in real life! The lounge plays this really dark lounge music and they play old Hitchcock films on the TVs. There is art everywhere! The beds are so cozy. The best part is the food! we ordered a grilled salmon and some omelets (don't judge I was starving from a late night in Vegas!) I have never eaten better food! I will never stay at another hotel! This place is the only place to stay in Vegas!

As an A's fan I feel constantly like Jan.  It's always Giants, Giants, Giants! But as a fan of baseball, I must give props to their stadium.  They certainly have us beat.  From the food to the location to the building itself.   My father and I always enjoy watching the A's go up against the Giants.  I being a A's fan to the core and him not caring either way.  He took me to the Scottsdale Stadium the first time and I was blown away.  It feels like a real ballpark.  From the bricks to the gates to the outside vendors.  You can't help but get that good old fashion American feeling.  Parking is a bit difficult, but we have to give a little leeway on this.  They are in Scottsdale after all.   When we went in I had to get a brat and a beer (this was before my vegetarian days).  But brats were not all they had.  They have flat bread, chow mien, Hawaiian BBQ, and i think i even saw a Mexican food stand.  I love choices! But I'm old fashion and stuck to what felt was right.   I was very impressed with our seats.  We got lawn and we still had a great view, it was comfortable and we weren't ignored by the beer vendor (very important when getting seats).  All in all it was an amazing father daughter time.  I don't have to love the giants to love their stadium.  But P.S.  That game the A's smoked the Giants! Go A's!

To all the folks out there...I like this bar (no, this ain't no Toby Keith song). But let me warn you this bar isn't for everyone. Here is a test to see if you'll like this bar. If you answer no to any of these, don't bother going...   -If you laugh at a dirty joke or when someone farts  -if you ever had a crush on Ginger or Maryann...or the professor (I don't judge)  -If you ever played a practical joke  -If you enjoy the movies porkies, animal house, or American pie the original   Let me tell you why I enjoy this bar...I love the bartenders. They will hassle you a bit, make a joke at your expense but they don't mind when you hassle them too. They serve Skull vodka! This vodka is not found everywhere but I do enjoy my skull! This bar has the maturity of a 13 year old, so it is a great place to just act like a kid again. And let me tell you the food is pretty good! mind you it is bar food, so it is greasy, delicious, and big portions.   Gilligan's might be extremely loud, packed, and kinda like hanging with your 13 year old cousin...but these are all the reasons why I love it. It's a great get away in the middle of Scottsdale to enjoy some plunger shots, a midget bar, and some good ol' fashion dirty jokes with friend!

I can't sing this places praises high enough.  It is my escape from the Scottsdale scene.  The enviroment is so beautiful.  As soon as you open the massive double doors you are transported into another world.  The atmosphere is very dark (which I love).  And here is the best part...The service is awesome! Not only is the staff very welcoming but if you don't know much about wine (like me) they will help you out.  Everyone needs to go on Sunday when they have the Flaminco music.  It is such a cool little place to relax and get swanky.

For the weird, crazy, and old...This place is awesome! I went here for fun on my way to pick up lunch.  Needless to say, never got my lunch, I was wandering around the store for an hour and a half.  This place was so cool.  They had so much stuff from the late 1800's to around the 1970's.  Now these are my type of antiques!  I saw an 1900's old doctor examining table that i couldn't leave.  It was so great to see something that bizarre! I didn't end up getting it sadly.  Between the fact that it was out of my budget (it was around 550.00) and I had no where to put it.  But how i did want it!  There stuff is really cool, but I will admit slightly pricey.  I think you need to remember when shopping here that these are well taken care of antiques and not just your aunts grungy sofa.  But if you ever want to time travel, this is a great place to start!

I love Seth!!! I found out about him through a friend and I will never go to another artist again.  I had a horrible cover up of a sacred heart that I hated.  It was a total mess.  Seth was awesome.  He took his time and gave me a really personal tattoo to cover it up.  I love my tattoo now! He is the only person I will go to for my tattoos.  Best artist in Phoenix!

To Salvation Army: Don't you want my money to do good?  You have some furniture and knick knacks that I wanted, but for whatever reason you seemed not to want me to buy them.  The store clerks were watching TV and talking in the mock living room setting.  I even checked with them to see if they worked there so that I could get some assistance.  Assistance is not what I got.  There was a broken down couch and a broken down chair for sale for $300!! I thought I might be able to afford the arm chair (which is actually all I wanted) so I asked if I could only buy the chair.  The guy just gave me a short "No."  I asked why, and he just told me meanly that "They don't do that.  It's a set, take it or leave it".  I'm sorry...Did I stumble into Crate and Barrel?  I kinda wish I had, I might of gotten nicer service.  Next time I need to thrift it up, I'll go to good will.  Change the tune Salvation Army, you're no sisters attic.  -Whitney

My experience at Excalibur is like living in the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Of course minus the dinosaurs, paintings of Barbara Streisand and Gary Busey. On second thought seeing Gary Busey there wouldn't be too far off.  I was in charge of planning my sister in laws bachelorette party. So where do you take a lovely workaholic to cut loose? Vegas baby! This would be every ones first trip to Vegas and it had to be perfect.  Excalibur got my reservation because it was in the middle of the strip, had great prices, and had Thunder Down Under (of course we went!)  I love this hotel. Sure it isn't the nicest hotel on the strip and the decorations look like they haven't been changed since the 1979, but that is why I love it! Its classic Vegas! kitschy, gimmicky, and historical!  The only thing modern here is the pool which was always packed and the service was amazing! I'd stay here any day!  This place made the bachelorette party amazing and completely memorable!

If you have ever watched the movie roadhouse or Coyote Ugly and thought "I have to go there!" or "That there is a drinking spot". Well, look no further then Dylan's Roadhouse (originally Dylan's Dance Hall) in Vegas. This place is not your average Vegas strip location with covers and the same fist pumping clubbers.   This place is about 5 minutes from the strip but is diffidently worth the detour. The vibe when you first walk in is this is an "anything goes good time rock/country bar". They have a live wolf chilling at the entrance! I mean, Come On! When you walk in you are greeted to a great mixture of country and rock.   The staff are so extremely nice and are quick to give introductions to other patrons. It truly feels like a unified party in there. Just watch how much you drink, those ladies have a heavy hand and their drinks are quite stiff.   Beyond the bar you are also greeted to tons of TVs that play sports and old dukes of hazard videos. There is a mechanical bull, beer pong, and a huge dance floor to two step on. But out back I hear a little rumor they will show live MMA fights! Once again I give it another, Come On! How cool is that!   This is a great place to grab a beer and enjoy some chill people who don't need bottle service to have a great time!

I took the beautiful Carin S. (my lovely mom) on a mother and daughter trip to Vegas. Holy crap we had fun! I'm surprised Vegas is still standing after our trip. New York New York was wonderful and I'd sure stay there over and over again! We checked in fairly quickly considering it was peak time and spring break. When we got to our room I was amazed! The view was great and the room was very modern. I could have easily spent the weekend relaxing in the room. But this is Vegas, so of course we didn't. After we polished off a bottle of champagne we were off to the casino to give away our money. With a good buzz, I falsely felt lucky and donated my money to the starving casino fund. I have to say I had such a blast doing it that I didn't even mind! And lets get to the yelpers favorite part of places...The FOOD! Greasy New York style pizza, Starbucks, a really great Mexican restaurant, and room service! OH MY! My fat kid was blushing with all the choices. I have to recommend the pizza the most. It was a great way to start a night of drinking with my mom.  All in all we had a blast, lost a few bucks, but made some great memories. New York New York was a wonderful hotel/casino and I'd stay there again in a heart beat!

After a hard couple hours at the tables at the beautiful MGM, my buddy and I needed some food. I was famished. Vegas has this crazy spell it puts on me and I totally forget to eat. I think I get distracted by the shiny objects. But back to Diego's.  The restaurant was beautiful! It had this modern Spanish style to it. Bright colors and once again those shiny objects that get me all the time! After a quick glance of the menu we decided this will do. During prime business hours we were able to get right in! Always a plus for me.  The wait staff was very nice and I had myself a margarita. I don't enjoy margaritas to often, but I love them so much! However this margarita was more sour on the rocks then a margarita. Very disappointing. Next, on my slow spiral into Mexican sadness we were offered guacamole. Guac is free at the restaurant I work at, so silly me says sure! Little did I know I'd be paying top dollar for a mashed avocado with out flavor. You live, you learn.  When our food came we were about ready to die from starvation. It took a little longer then I had anticipated. I was shocked! Not only did my cheese enchiladas look like two sad cheese logs in a pond of enchilada sauce, but all of our food looked so sad. I think they put it under the heat lamp way to long.  The bill came and being the gentleman my friend is he paid. However I did sneak a peak and was amazed at how much the bill was for how dismal the product was.  You might want to skip this place if at the MGM. You'll find better food at Chipolte.  My experience here can be summed up in a quote from David Sedaris, "The food was awful, and there was so little of it".

Where can women single and taken alike go to scream like banshees at half clothed Australians? Thunder Down Under of course! This was the only show that my sister in law wanted to attend. Since she was a chill bride and that was her only request for her party of course I happily purchased tickets for the gang of (partially) single ladies! Needless to say we had a blast!  I got us tickets close to the stage where we sat with other bachelorettes and newly divorcees. A weird mix if you ask me. but everyone there was loud fun and ready for a great show. The drinks were cheap and easily received even with a packed house.  This show was all women which made it a lot more fun! And let me tell you...When the show started it not only was extremely entertaining, but the MC was so funny! It had everything (except nudity which was more then Ok by me). So if you are looking for a great show for you and your girls...come to this one! It is a must see and I can't wait to take a new crop of ladies!

Pump the breaks. I was in the mood to see pasta shells the size of my ears, and sauce gave me what I wanted!  I have been to sauce several times and loved each and every time! I don't go often since I can't seem to stay away from that dang macaroni and cheese (really shells and cheese). So I go when I'm truly wanting to splurge. It is amazing! the sauce is so cheesy and melty. It's like a cheesy melty goodness! The pizza is always amazing and well made. And the salad is shut your mouth good! You can't beat this place for some quick bistro Italian food. And if you feel like loving your inner fat kid, go pick up the tiramasu. Fan-freakin-tastic!  But here is truly the best part...It is in a great part of town, the restaurant is always super clean, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and they have pasta shells the size of your ears!  I don't know if you can tell or not, but I love this place. It is always a fun spot to go for lunch when you feel like being bad.

Ok folks, I usually am not a scottsdale girl.  I usually enjoy a dive bar at happy hour or my parents house (love you mom and dad!) But I have to say I had a blast here!! I was there to help with a Jon Ric Fashion Show and had the time of my life.    Our server was so cute! she was always right there to make sure we had ice, our bottle, and mixers.  Plus I don't remember seeing a dirty glass EVER at our table! I'm a server and that is not easy to do.  So good job staff.    The dancers were great and the music was so varied! there really was something for everyone.  I would go back again in a heart beat!

Let me tell you about the best piercing shop in Arizona! I started going to HTC about a year ago to stretch my ears and I will always go back! The piercers are so nice and knowledgeable.  The shop is clean, and their selection of jewlery is amazing! Tons of organic, glass, metal, and rare pieces for any hole you have! If you have not had the pleasure of going to this amazing shop, do yourself a favor and go!

Oprah gave this one of her favorite marks? Really?! I mean REALLY?!? Oprah never stirrers me wrong.  Well, I went to Sprinkles. Oprah did give it to her AUDIENCE (that was suppose to be said like she says it, I guess it doesn't translate into writing. Just looks like I have a volume control problem). Back to sprinkles.  When they first opened (yeah I know this review is long over do, don't judge), they sent my work a box of cup cakes to try out so we would recommend them to our guests. I tried a bite of the red velvet, lemon, vanilla, and chocolate. This is what I tasted: dry, over powering flavor with the lemon, bland on the other flavors, and frosting is WAY too sweet. No flippin way am I going back.  Well, they got me. I went back on a sugar attack and needing my fix. I busted into that place like a crack addict. I went for the red velvet again. I thought they might have worked out the kinks and it should be better this time. I mean Oprah did recommend it! Well as it turns out, there were no kinks...that was just sprinkles. Bland, dry and frosting that is too sugary. I think I'll go to a less expense place when I need a sugar fix. Sorry Oprah, you lost me with Sprinkles.

Ok...So here's the deal. You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world.  I feel horrible doing this, but I mean come on! Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food).  But what got me more then the horrible food, was the service.  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone, Than It took another 10 for her to come out.  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table.  The food was cold, service was slow, and it was not worth the money.  I vow to never go there again! There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place.

I have been meaning to tell yelpers about this place...But silly me, the yelpers seem to have known about this long before me! You guys are so in the know!  Well I'm happy to see that everyone loves this place as much as me! I discovered this place when I used to work on Mill ave. Let me tell you it only took one hesitant lunch before I was craving it every night!  First off...they deliver! For a fat kid on the go, This is always a plus! To find a place that delivers that is neither Chinese or pizza is pretty freakin cool!  Second...The owners are super nice! They always great you with a smile and work hard to make sure that you are satisfied with your order. It is a little hard to understand them, but it just means the food is authentic. At least I think so!  And the most important...The food is really good! I love their vegetarian plate and the desert is wonderful! I would choose this place over big fat Greek any day of the week! really beyond good.  The only bad that dropped it from a 5 to a 4 star...location, location, location. Mill is such a pain in the butt to drive on. and the parking is no better. But I will always brave the crowds of students and snow birds to eat there any day!

Oh Geisha, how you go go! I went here with a couple of my friends after their day of Sunday Funday and my day Work day Shmerk day.  I had never had the opportunity to go to this place but was always wanted to try it out since their seemed to a nice crowd on the patio.  Well let me tell you what I think, that is why you are reading this of course... It was packed! Like crazy packed! But there was the nicest hostess! We had a party of about 8 people coming and she said it would be a wait, but not a problem! She kept checking in with me to make sure I was ok and letting me know where we were on the wait time for the table!  Who ever was working as the hostess on the 4/18 around 5pm.  Give that chick a raise! She was awesome! No matter how busy I saw she was, she always made me feel like I was not forgotten in the shuffle. Well we sat down and my friends were drunk and starving! I mean they spent the day at the culinary festival so you know they didn't have an opportunity to eat! Our waitress was so sweet! she informed us that it was half off Sunday! All sushi and drinks were half off! I've never been so happy in all my life! I ordered two vegetarian rolls and my friends ordered the left side of the menu plus a couple rolls and drinks.  Our waitress was on top of it!  After the crazy amount of drinks and food that we ordered the bill was only $70.  If you eat at a sushi restaurant, anyone knows the bill is usually around $100.  I was so impressed!  This place is awesome and should defiantly be a stop on a Sunday Funday! Oh P.S.  Their toilets are crazy! their mechanical and warming and I don't know what is going on, but you have to check it out.

Ok...My parents (including the legendary Don S. himself) love this place. They see a certain server who I must admit is awesome! Very helpful and super happy. I wish I could give him a shout out, but my parents will have to tell you his name. Sorry awesome Pearl server...   This review is aimed at EVERYONE else...I have great service when I'm with my folks (they must be celebrities). But every time I went with my friends,and we have really bad service and ok food and drinks. What can I say im a glutton for pain I guess.   I think the servers and bartenders must have selective sight because we always get over passed for food and drinks. Longest time waited for a drink...20minutes! If it wasn't for my friends I would have left. They too are gluttons for pain and thirst. The worst part is I feel like I'm inconveniencing them for sitting there.   I have to say food isn't too bad. Their rolls can be found at any trendy sushi place. But the spring rolls blew me away. The spicy dipping sauce really was great! But not enough to give this place 3 stars and not enough food to feed any one with a decent appetite.   The drinks...hmmm...pretty good bomber list but do not order any Alcohol with a mixer. their bartenders are so light handed I doubt there is even a full shot in there. I recommend asking for the shot on the side to make sure you get what you pay for.   It has a huge patio and great for people watching but if you're not going with my parents...you might want to skip this trendy old town spot.

I can't believe I haven't written a review about the wonderful Chipotle (I can spell it, can't pronounce it). I am always greeted with a friendly staff and a clean restaurant! Then here is a yelpers favorite part: the food is consistently great! I have never had a bag thing a Chipotle. Everything is wide open so you can see everything being cooked and made for you. How cool is it that you can actually wave to the people making your food. I always love places that open their kitchen up to their guests. It shows they have nothing to hide. The only bad thing... Catch them at a lunch rush and you could be waiting awhile. A small price to pay for freshly cooked food!  And just in case you were wondering... I am eating it right now :)

hmmm...where do I begin with Cadillac Ranch. I first went there to meet a friend for lunch. He knew the owner and we went to support his friends business. I'm all for trying new places and I thought this might be pretty good.  As you walk in the atmosphere is pretty cool. Dark wood and knick knacks hung from the walls. Kinda reminded me of an adult TGIF. We sat down and must of waited 10 minutes till a server carved out some time in her schedule to greet us. We gave her our order. She came back pretty quick with drinks but the 2 salads we ordered took 20 minutes! when I looked at my salad I saw cheese was covering my salad! I asked told the waitress that I asked for no cheese and her kind response was "What do you want me to do about it?". Uh, I don't know...fix it?! I think I'm on a new theory of the cuter the server the crappier the service.   OK so I went again after vowing never to come back. My co worker and I were looking for a place to enjoy margaritas and nachos. Well, we still waited a 10 minutes till we were greeted but food came out much faster and the service was friendlier.   So why do you ask if i had better service yet I still gave it 2 stars? In a totally empty restaurant I still had to wait 10 minutes for service, the nachos were good but so small for the price. This place is far from being the restaurant I want to come back to.

You gotta love a place that gives you a best friend.  I got Brady on a whim 7 years ago from here.  Maybe not the smartest decision since I was unemployed and new to phoenix, but hands down the best decision I have ever made.  I can remember going up and down the kenneled dogs and cats with my roommate at the time trying to find the perfect dog for him.  What I found was a brother and a sister in a kennel.  Well needless to say I parked my buns in front of that kennel and couldn't (or wouldn't) move till we took both pups.  The girl for him and the boy for me.  Brady has been there for every turn in my life and has been the most amazing little pup even when I wasn't the most amazing owner.  This place is a wonderful shelter.  It has a clean facility, friendly staff, decent prices, and help you in every step of the adoption process.  I'm not sure if the reason for the 5 stars is sentimentally driven or not, but I don't care.  Like I said, you gotta love a place that gives away best friends.

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if your local safe way and ikea had a baby? Only me...odd. Well that is the best way to describe Fresh and Easy. It truly is the Ikea of grocery stores and I maintain that the Swedes have their hands in this grocery. Here is why I think this:  A) Everything is Really clean. Like White. Like dentist office clean. It's almost too clean.  B) The prices are phenomenal for what you get! I feel like you can spend $5 for a three course meal! It is awesome!  C) The food feels organic. I can't say that it actually is, but the way it is packaged at least makes you feel that way.  D) It's tiny. It truly is a neighborhood market and not a store. I think there are maybe three isles in that whole place.  E) The selection of food is amazing! You can find almost anything in this tiny store.  So the jury is still out whether or not the Swedes master minded another amazing store, but this is truly one of my favorite places to buy food at!

Look down at your nails. Go ahead do it. Now tell your hands you're sorry. Now tell your hands you'll make it up to them by taking them to 7 day spa and nails.  I just got a manicure from this place. I'm being serious. My nails are still wet. i work at a salon and spa so I hardly go anywhere else to get services done, but our nail technician is always busy and I had to get in before a trip. So I went two doors down to get my nails did!  I wasn't expecting much from the outside. It looks like your average hole in the wall nail place. But when I walked in I was pleasantly greeted and immediately taken.  My lady didn't really speak English too well, but she was nice enough and asked if I was OK. Very very nice.  I found out that this location does waxing. I'm not a hundred percent that I would recommend coming here to receive a wax since I had a little trouble communicating with my lady. But the women who went back there came out with decent looking brows. So I could always be wrong.  All in all, my nails came out very good and the women worked well under the time crunch I had. I will most certainly be back for a pedicure and another mani. I had a good experience.

I just got this new product from the salon I work at called Solar White.  It whitens your teeth while you tan in a bed or outside.  Its pretty cool, and I highly recommend it.  But I digress.  I went to this tanning salon to try out my new product and also to check out the salon.  It was beautiful and the front guy was really nice and explained each bed and what it would do for me.  The guy at the front was really super helpful with helping me pick out a bed and lotion.  The bed was awesome! it pumped really cool lounge music and was definitely worth the money.  However, I'm not sure what happened when I got out cause it seemed like the catty police rolled through the lounge.  There was a new guy sitting next to the nice one.  Thrilled with the results of the new product I had just bought I wanted to tell them about how great it was.  As I started to tell them the guy who had helped me shot me down and ended it with "Like this one?" and showed me a tiny display of teeth whitening.  I felt like I just got verbally smacked.  Then the other guy at the front knew one of the stylists in my salon which I now know was not a good thing and they have personal issues.  TMI!  The only thing is this would have been a 3 star review if I had just walked out.  Word to the front desk boys: The Last impression is the Lasting impression.
