Well the front desk lady was nice at first. Then when I decided to leave (because the wait is ridiculous) she laughed and made a smart remark. I was still polite as she handed me back my ID. I noticed the prices have changed. It's more expensive and id be better off going somewhere else.

I will definitely be visiting this place again! Such a great experience with great staff members. Today i accidentally scraped one of my back dermal piercings out. I went in and explained the situation to a guy with tattoos. He took me in and re-pierced it. I was really nervous but he calmed the situation down and made me feel at ease. When he was done he gave me some anti-bacterial sea-salt and said i was good to go and it was on him. His kindness and generosity made my day. I  would definitely refer any one who needs a piercing to go to HTC!

If you want your eyebrows to look amazing then go to Esthetics by Faith and see Faith! She is awesome! I had bought a groupon to get my eyebrows done, and expected a normal outcome, but she exceeded my expectations. She is so sweet, and really listens (which is important for me)! Thank you girl! I WILL be back :)

Love this place! I went to the car wash and had an unfortunate thing happen. A piece of my car had fallen off while going through the wash. The adhesive had already been loosing it's stickiness, but I did not think it would fall off lol. Fortunately, they were able to put it back on for me and I couldn't be more thankful! Looks good as new! Plus the nice $3 wash ;). Thanks Cobblestone!
