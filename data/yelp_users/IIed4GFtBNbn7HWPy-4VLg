The people who work there are somewhat pleasant, but that doesn't help when they sell you one defective product after the other.  I can't keep coming back and buying cartridges that don't work in my printer.  I was finally given a replacement, but then when it stopped working, I was told I used too much ink and I was screwed.  The customer service (from the top) is horrible.  I've come to the conclusion it's worth a few extra bucks to buy OEM.  Don't depend on Cartridge World to help you out.

The food at this CPK is pretty good.  I guess you could say that for any of the CPKs, but they always do a nice job at this location and are very accommodating of any special requests.  I realize for the relatively low price you pay, you're not getting top-of-the-line cuisine, but it's a great for what it's intended.  The one negative thing I'd say is skip the wine list.  As you can imagine at a strip-center type chain restaurant, it's not exciting, although the staff actually seem to have a good idea of wine pairing in general for those who are new to wine.  I don't drink beer but have been told by fellow guests the beer selection is decent.  The service at this CPK is pretty good.  There are actually a few servers there that always remember me, even down to what I like to eat, even when it's been six months since I've last been in.  It's very impressive that they remember me and the staff in general (save the host staff when it's busy) is very pleasant.

This is a fabulous Italian restaurant.  The service is impeccable and very professional.  The waiter seemed to have an infinite knowledge of almost every menu item available.  It was like nothing I've ever seen.  The food is excellent, as well.  Some of the specials are quite pricey, but everything is handmade and worth the money.  This is definitely a great place for special occasions.  The old restaurant in uptown Phoenix was a bit more quaint and more convenient for me, but I'm willing to make the drive anywhere in the valley for this great restaurant.  I'm actually planning my (small) rehearsal dinner there for later this year.

Finally checked out Marcellino at their Scottsdale location for the first time.  It's as good as it always has been and the new location offers more space and a nice ambiance. The food is still great, the service was very warm, and the whole atmosphere is still inviting and cozy.  I had feared their move to Scottsdale would cause it to become overly trendy and lose focus, but I far undersold Marcellino and his team.  And despite having great food, the prices are quite reasonable.  Having dined in Italy recently, I can say the experience here was on par with that and hope to I to return soon.

I needed an answer on a title after the MVD's normal hours. I called this place expecting to ask a quick question about their services and get blown off the phone. I've been to one or two other MVD-alternative stores and gotten pretty apathetic, inept service.  Instead, I got very courteous service and someone who answered questions I didn't even think of. The girl here was very patient and helpful. These guys definitely have their act together and are went out of their way for me.

Yao's is excellent.  I go there 2-3 times a month and have been for almost two years... and I live 30 miles away.  It is a pleasant atmosphere, not too loud or too crammed, and the owner is usually there talking to customers.  She or the waitress (if she's not there) always make time to chat with me.  Food is pretty good and there's a lot of it, especially on the combo meal.  Crab puffs are great, plus good soups and great shrimp dishes.

I love the feel of this place.  It's so homey and a bit blue-blood.  The ivy and classic architecture will never go out of style with me.  The now-paid parking on the south side is a bit annoying and faux-exclusive.  But the selection of the stores is interesting, even if not completely conducive to being a 20-something year old guy.  It's just a fun hang-out with a few good eateries and places you can't find anywhere else.

Having now been to Firestone's Tempe location (see review), I have had more than my fill of this one.  Snarly and impatient service and you have to haggle with them from time to time.  When I got a flat tire a week after having four brand new tires installed in Tempe (who did a great job), these guys made me fight to get it taken care of.  If it weren't for not wanting to drive on the spare, I'd have to gone to Tempe and imagine things would have gone much easier.  Mind you, these were the guys who, according to my old mechanic, allegedly didn't re-seal something or other when changing my oil, causing a major malfunction.  I'm not a mechanic, so I can't say whether that's true or not, but it's the reason I get my oil changed only at the dealer now.

The staff here is really responsive and actually listens to your concerns and responds accordingly.  They were very attentive and professional and made some great recommendations.  No rushing you along, no platitudes, just nice people you can actually identify with and who help you get what you need.

Pretty good service.  The techs were friendly and explained everything to me.  They also agreed to match a competitors coupon and added on an extra discount.  I don't know much about tires but felt comfortable with their recommendations.

Certainly some aspects of it are pretentious, but they get all the great stores, and have still maintained some of the standard mid-range stores.  Parking, while bewildering at first, is rather convenient and easy for a mall of this stature and size.  Compare to the Beverly Center or The Grove in LA and it's great.

The service at this restaurant is horrible.  My friend and I had wanted to go to the Phoenician lobby for burgers, but they were going to close, so we went here.  Basically, Delux is one of those places that charges you Phoenician-like rates and puts on the same kind of politically correct show with the fancy-pants decor, but the service is at the same level as McDonald's.  First of all, the service is slow.  And the waiter was moderately unpleasant from the beginning.  And they sat us at a tiny table for 2.  So far, no big deal.  But then the impatient staff comes over and kept trying to take away our dishes.  "Are you finished with that plate?", the waiter asked, when I was only half finished with the burger.  Eventually, they swooped in and took the plate out without asking.  They also took other stuff of mine and threw it away.  The manager is some girl barely out of high school with a sassy attitude, and even before I explained my situation, you could tell she could care less. (She eventually found some of my stuff, then lied and said it hadn't been in the garbage.) Then, when the server sees me leaving no tip, he starts swearing at me, and when we leave, he makes a point to open the door and say "Thanks for nothing".  Little did he realize that since I put the meal on my credit card, my friend left the tip in cash.  A 22% tip.  So much for service.  We could have gone to the Phoenician and they would have blown us kisses even if we didn't tip.  And if they would have taken my stuff and thrown it away without asking, they probably would have given me a free room.  That's the difference between real class and service, and fakers like the kind who work at Delux.  I am never going back ever again, and I'm sure until the doors close, no one at Delux will care about my return, or that of anyone else's.  Customers seem to be the impediment to their running what would otherwise be, in their opinion, a great restaurant.

Probably the best buffet ever.  I tell everyone going to Vegas to eat there.  Unfortunately, every so often the line is soooo long that it's just not feasible for me to eat there.  So go early or go for lunch.  The selection is pretty good; not great, but close.  The food quality is very fresh and the seafood dishes in particular are excellent.  King crab leg all the way on down; as you'd expect from the Wynn, they don't skimp.  It's quality food and far and away the best buffet in Vegas.  While other buffets seem to be going downhill (all while charging hefty fees), Wynn does not disappoint.  It's hardly cheap, but it's not that much more than MGM or Rio or Mandalay Bay or any of the places you'd expect to be decent that are very unmemorable.  The people at the front aren't that pleasant all the time, but service once seated is quite good.

I've been going to Ticoz with friends and family for years ever since it opened. It certainly does have a "city" vibe, so some people have been a bit surprised by that. But the food is good. I consistently go with people who say it's better than their Mexican aunt's/mother's/etc's similar dish. The service has gotten a little more spotty as of late, even when they are slow late at night. But the happy hour deals are great and you have to check them out. I'd still recommend it, but don't go too close to closing time.

The host staff and phone staff were so-so.  I recently organized a large family get-together and the other places we contacted in this range have such better customer service.  It seems as if Wildfish hires impish, primping high-school girls to answer the phone.  Not acceptable when their competitors in the seafood space all provide far superior service...  Ocean Prime, McCormick and Schmick's, etc.

I have to admit; the food at the Vig is actually halfway decent.  The service, on the other hand, is the problem.  I recently ate at the Vig for the second time on a Saturday night.  I found the service to be slow and a bit pretentious.  Apparently my tip wasn't large enough for the waiter, because when my credit card bill posted, they had added a tip to my bill.  I called the restaurant on a weekday when I figured they would have more time to help me, and after 15 minutes on hold, they basically blew me off.  I was polite and calm on the phone.  I told the manager I was overcharged and that I was more disturbed over the added tip because of the service I received.  I kind of felt like it was a bother for the small amount involved, but to me it was the principle involved.  The manager asked me to share with her why I was dissatisfied to help her improve her service, but I didn't want to relive the experience, nor did I really care if anything happened to the server.  I just wanted the money that was mysteriously added to my bill back.  You'd think you'd get an apology for wasting 25 minutes on the phone, most of it on hold, trying to solve their overcharging of you.  But I didn't.  Instead, when the manager started to bust on me for not sharing my bad experience (to which I told her I didn't want to relive it), she became very passive aggressive, hastily said "have a nice night" and hung up on me.  I don't suppose I'll be going back to the Vig.

Update 11/11/10. Hostess was stuffy and couldn't imagine someone would go there by themselves. So she sat everyone before me then asked me when the rest of my party was coming. No tables left, I sat at the bar not exactly in a great mood. Don't sit at the bar if you want anyone to pay attention to you. When they do, they won't be able to hear you, so they'll throw their arms up in the arm and not bring you what you ordered, until the next bartender comes along and says their co-worker "forgot". Service here must be consistently horrible. I keep giving it another shot and always leave disappointed and in a worse mood than when I came.  True to form, the food was decent.  Not great, not good, but decent. But decent food + horrible service + attitude + getting elbowed in the head by the drunk guy standing next to you = no buenas dias for me.

Went there before an ASU game as two couples.  The server was pretty nice but very unprepared and kept forgetting things.  At one point, we made a bet that one girl would never get the lime in her beer that she ordered right when we sat down.  The bet against the lime won.  The manager did agree with us and worked to remedy the situation, but it took sooo long to get all of our food and drinks and half of it was messed up.  In no rush to return.

The technician was super friendly and seemed very knowledgeable.  He got to the bottom of things in a few minutes whereas others had bumbled around and given me the run around.  He spent all the time needed to thoroughly explain everything to me.  I also had my handyman over, who is very knowledgeable with a lot of mechanical things, and he was very impressed with the guy as well.  I definitely feel comfortable with this guy being upfront and honest with me.

Since you don't see that much of the dentist, it's his office staff that shapes opinion of the office, and they suck. They don't take the time to explain anything to you, and in my case, this resulted in an extra $50-ish in charges I wasn't expecting.  They scoffed at even the simplest question about the fee that came up, getting defensive immediately. The dentist's work is alright, but I've had better.  The dentist seems to be very young and doesn't look at all like a dentist which doesn't necessarily mean anything, but between getting in the chair late, my billing experience, and the dental assistant being hard to get any answers from, I wasn't too thrilled to see any more.

King's is a great experience.  The food is fresh, well prepared, comes in a good portion size, and is served by attentive staff.  I even enjoy the decor of the restaurant; it fits the bill quite well.  I'm not saying it's the best fish house ever, but considering the somewhat reasonable prices, it's a safe bet.

Fantastic scenery, phenomenal service no matter when you go, a very pleasant decor/smell/ambience, and decent drink and food specials. Some of the food there is the best I've ever had from that category.  I don't drink much outside of wine, but the wine list isn't half bad.  No matter how I feel, I can't not be in a great mood sitting at the Thirsty Camel.  It's the best of the best in the city as far as I'm concerned, and I have recommended in multiple times for numerous situations.

Only had drinks there on my birthday, but the experience was pretty bleh.  Inattentive and condescending service.  I realize this is part of a small chain of jerkish, faux-high end restaurants catering to cougars, the douches who are their prey, and the creepy, lecherous old guys who are their alimony meal ticket, but you'd think they could muster a smile for a guy paying their prices.  As to food, I'm plenty happy with the steaks at Ruth's Chris to risk suffering through their uninviting dining room and elitist service again.  I realize I'll have to find my condescending bleached blond hookup for that night somewhere else, but so be it.  UPDATE: Got an email from the manager in regards to this post; it was total form email with no sincerity to it.

Being a two-minute walk from Maizie's, I've tried it many times; both for dinner, for lunch, for business, for pleasure.  It is pretty consistent... not great, but above average.  I mostly stick to sandwiches, which are good, albeit it a bit expensive for what you get (in my case, not full).  The burgers are decent, and on Monday nights at $3, you can't lose.  The service is friendly there for the most part.  On one or two occasions, I felt like I didn't fit into the bartender's "urban scene" and felt a bit uncomfortable, but for the most part, I've had a lot of great conversations with the staff there.  They feel "real".

I would have liked to given this place a great review since it's so close to me.  I was really looking forward to taking a lot of people here.  But the gelato was soupy, and you don't get much for your money.  I'm not sure how unstained concrete with cracks contributes to the atmosphere.  They did give us a free cappuccino, and I'm not a coffee drinker, but my friend and I didn't really care for it.  Everything was kept clean, but food just wasn't that good.

The service here is very good.  I've been coming for years, even back to the days when it was less trendy/more traditional French countryside upstairs of the Biltmore.  The waitstaff, despite the hip decor and occassionally foreign menu item, are very pleasant, not condescending, and quite helpful.  What's great is that whether I go for a formal dinner for a special occasion, or with a friend to "cheap" it out for burgers and duck fries, the service is the same.    There are some great menu items and you could spend many visits exploring them.  Goat cheese flatbread, gruyere pomme puree, lobster bisque, the burger, the salmon... all rather good.  Definitely a favorite in my rotation.  And nice decor to heighten the mood further.

Horrible customer service.  Everyone is completely rude.  If you're a guy there to buy a gift, you'll get looked at like you're from Mars or some kind of pervert.  Elsa in particular is horrible.  She is condescending, obnoxious, and unhelpful, which may be why the rest of her subordinates are the same way.  I tried to address my bad experience with her and she tried to put it back on me.  Maybe the people working there are so brainwashed they don't realize how snotty they are to people.  I usually have a miserable experience at this store, with the passive-aggressive salespeople who ignore you, then are astounded that you want help, then rush to help you and get you out, all while using corporate-speak to pretend they're nice. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E.  Tempe location is MUCH better, I gave it 4 stars because people actually help you there.

The "valet" in the parking lot was the first tip-off. I thought it would be an isolated part of the experience, but it was not.  I'm all for valet, but when "valet" means moving my car 10 feet next to other cars that self-parked, that's a bit pretentious.  So, apparently is the whole restaurant.  Don't get me wrong... not pretentious in a tuxedo-wearing-waiter sort of way.  No, this is Arizona pretentious... overpriced dishes, mediocre quality, smallish portions, and staff that can't wait to jump out of their shells to tell you how their food is "made with love" and every other BS line they have.  When the owner came by the say hello, he started with "hey, man, I'm Erik and this is my place". "My place"? What, is this his living room?  If I'm buying a $19 salad with chicken, I don't want to be called "man" and greeted by shaky-wristed guys wearing graphic T-shirts delivering my salad ("you did order the salad, right sir?", before setting it down).  If you like the Vig or any of the other pseudo-pretentious "hot spots" that populate Phoenix these days, maybe this is your place.  The atmosphere is nice from a decor standpoint, although I know that anyplace decorated that way is d-bag central.  I'm all for nice service but not fake nice.  Read my other reviews and you'll see I'm not into "the scene".  My psychoanalysis on The Parlor, other than the food is very average and even a bit bland, is that it's the place soulless people go to convince themselves they're not soulless because they had a conversation with their waiter about hair pom and told the lifeless, dull-as-dishwater hostess they bought their girlfriend the same pair of jeans.  For $19, I'll get a salad at the Phoenician and actually have a conversation with the young server about world travels.  If The Parlor didn't have seven waiters all serving you different parts of your dinner so that you could have such a conversation, I doubt the paper-thin likability would last long.

Let's face it... everyone will keep shopping at VS no matter how bad the reviews are here.  It's not like you go there for the service.  That said, I go out of my way to visit this location when I'm shopping for my girlfriend.  The girls here are actually pretty pleasant, actually say "hello" and welcome you rather than scattering as if to pretend to have things to do other than help you (read my Scottsdale review), and have provided good assistance in the past.  I like the layout of the store better here, too.  The vibe is just better and it's worth visiting this location,

Smug bozos.  Just what I'd expect from most realtors, but these guys really fit the bill.  Difficult to try and work with, irresponsible, unresponsive, and just too laid back for my taste.  It's like surf-bum laziness collided with Wall Street money-grubbing.

Helpful, friendly staff that does a nice job.  Food is pretty good, although I keep trying the same two things over and over (I guess that confirms it's good).  I can't get on board with the whole gourmet burger thing that has spread like a cancer through every westernized country on the planet, but I like Smashburger and had my girlfriend who hadn't been there tell me recently that I must have mentioned that we should go there about 1,000 times.  Has to count for something.

First of all, I'm tired of restaurants that play thumping music in the background and put a pair of cleavage cuties at the host stand to mask the weak food and marginal service.  And then have servers that appear to have never left Arizona but are experts in sushi and Japanese cuisine.  I realize that they're not a real "Japanese" restaurant, but nevertheless...  Bar staff was mediocre.  I sat there with little attention.  Food is nothing to write home about; nothing I had really stands out and it didn't seem the staff had any convincing recommendations.  It's not outrageously expensive, but it could get a bit pricey depending on how you order.  I suppose if you're here for a trendy snack before heading out dancing, it might fit, but if you actually want a meal, I wouldn't recommend it.  To top my meal off, I had a dry, flaky, not-so-tasty dessert that looked like an afterthought.  I realize desserts are the big margin item at a restaurant, but for $7, I would have liked it to look better put together.  Skip this one.  Especially at this location.  If you want the scene, go to Scottsdale.

I wasn't sure what to expect going on, but overall I was pretty satisfied.  The tacos are well done, with lots of interesting options influenced by different cuisines (think carnitas in Dr. Pepper).  Mexican food purists would be turned off by this place, but it's a fun joint to get a good couple of tacos.  The staff is a bit on the trendy side but overall is attentive.  The atmosphere is interesting and is a bit disjointed between the food they are serving, but it's still pleasant.  A fun place to get in and get out with some nice food.

Eh. Not many flavors, my favorite ones were out of order, fewer toppings than other places, and it was too crowded. Not a bad thing, but the whole place was in a certain state of disarray. I've had better.

This used to be a great casino.  Now it's just an aging casino in the middle of nowhere with surly staff and no remaining competitive advantage.  I used to come here all the time because they had good slots and good BJ.  It seems to me that the gambling has gone done hill and tightened up.  I also went to play video craps, but now that several other casinos in Phoenix have that, there is no reason to drive all the way to Maricopa.  They staff has become rather rude.  And best of all, get this; they ban all outside food and drink.  What casino has ever done that?  I tried to walk in with a bottled water recently and the security guy stopped me faster than I could blink and insist I put the drink in my car.  He says they sell drinks there, so they don't allow anyone to bring drinks.  I've never had that happen at any Harrah's casinos in Vegas, New Orleans, or anywhere else.  It just seems petty and ridiculous.  As if the probability of losing a couple hundred bucks in an hour and a half isn't enough, they have to make an extra $2.25 off of me when I buy a $2.50 can of Coke.  Classless.  There is no reason to come here anymore.  Harrah's comps are harder to come by, and unless you're playing slots with a ton of coin-in, the comps you earn won't make much of a dent toward getting freebies in Vegas. Come to think of it, if you're playing that much money, just go to Vegas.  If you don't care about earning comps for Vegas, then definitely don't bother driving out of your way to come to this casino.  Most of the casinos in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Chandler have remodeled recently and are much nicer and offer more fun.

I like the darker, slightly woodsy interior and somewhat intimate cut-out booths on the sides.  It's a nice environment.  Service is friendly and food was reasonably good.  The pretzels in beer cheese sauce were really good. The burger was above average, nothing special.
