When in Phoenix for a conference, my friend and I visited the Hard Rock Cafe. It's located across from the stadium so very convenient on game nights, but also close to the PHX Convention Center where our conference was.   We went at lunch and there was little to no crowd, so we were seated immediately by a great guy named Cody who works in the gift shop as well as waits on customers.   It was my friend's first visit to Hard Rock and Cody made it special for both of us. He gave us lots of details about the food. She ordered the chicken strip appetizer and he told her that it was kind of spicy- she's not a spicy fan, so he had the cook serve her the kid's version of the chicken tenders instead. I got the grilled veggie sandwich, which was on texas toast and had mushrooms and veggies and lots of cheese. Mine also came with fries, but you can upgrade to a salad or onion rings. I wasn't super hungry, so my friend and I shared the fries.   Our food was great, and we also bought some gifts. HRC even has a few clearance items and they have cute shirts, including ladies cut. The shirts were some of the best PHX souvenirs we saw for the price. The service was quick and we were finished and back at our conference without having to wait too long, and of course the atmosphere was typical Hard Rock Cafe with lots of great music.   I would definitely return to this Hard Rock Cafe.

South Park Mall is great. It's in Charlotte and I visited when I was there for a race. They have a lot of upscale stores, and people travel from all over NC and SC to come here, for good reason. There are also a lot of stores and restaurants nearby, it's a great place to visit and a great destination for Charlotte. One of the nicest malls I've ever been to.

My husband and I ate pizza here when we were at SouthPark Mall this past weekend. I'd never eaten here so had questions for the workers, which they answered. They were nice enough, but tried to charge us for a soft drink we didn't get. The pricing was a bit confusing and I'm still convinced we were overcharged.   I had a Greek stromboli and a Greek salad and thought it was okay- the marinara sauce for the stromboli was super thin, but the stromboli itself was fine with a nice blend of cheese, spinach, and tomatoes. Not that I had high expectations for mall food. I did like that you could get a salad on the side.   My husband wasn't very happy with his pizza. It was super thick crusted with very little toppings, and when he got it, it was still cold. He took it back and they re-heated it in the oven, but he still didn't like it very much.   Basically... it's mall food court pizza. If you really want good pizza, you don't go to the mall food court. If you're already there and want Italian food, you might be okay eating here but if you're craving pizza, I would skip it and go somewhere else.

I really liked this hotel and would stay here again. We stayed in room 434 which was on the corner and set back a little from the main hallway, so we don't have any noise complaints like I've read here.   The room/suite itself is great for a family or for someone travelling on business. There is a microwave/fridge, an office area (with a TV and couch), the bedroom, and the bathroom. If someone in your party wants to sleep and someone else wants to play on the laptop or watch TV, it's perfect for that. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had Crabtree and Evelyn brand shampoo and conditioner.   The hotel is decorated quite nicely. The garden in the lobby is pretty amazing, it makes you feel like you're somewhere other than near the Charlotte airport! There are fountains, statues, and lots of places to sit and chill. In the evenings between 5:30-7:30 there is a manager's reception with free drinks and a few snacks like pimento cheese, pub mix, etc.   If you really like breakfast, this hotel is your place. The eggs and omelets are cooked to order on the buffet each morning. On weekends, breakfast is 7-10, weekdays it starts at 6. Along with eggs and omelets, there's grits, pancakes, French Toast, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, and your traditional cereal and pastries. You can go through the line to get the made-to-order or just eat at the little buffet they put out. The made to order line was long but moved quickly. Our omelets were great.   The hotel is convenient to the interstates and airport, however, you will need a car to drive to get something to eat. There's an Omaha steakhouse on site and a few places deliver, but no restaurants within walking distance except a seedy little sports bar. We had a car with us so we drove to places to eat downtown and at South Park (the hotel is convenient to both).   Also, the wi-fi is not free so be prepared to pay around $10 per day. That was the only negative part about this hotel.

My coworker and I stayed here a few weeks ago for the Society of Technical Communication conference. This hotel is right across from the convention center so you can easily walk over, and we thought the hotel was great.   First, the room had a lot of space. There were plenty of outlets for charging and everything was very clean. The bathroom is spacious with really good soaps and shampoos, if you forget something like shaving cream or a razor, they have it for you at the front desk. We had no problems with the room at all.   If you're hungry, the hotel has a few restaurants inside. I didn't care for the restaurants inside, but it's great that they are there. There's also a little Starbucks across the street at the convention center and a few other good restaurants within walking distance. The front desk will give you a map and tell you about a few. They also have cucumber water out for you, which is great since PHX is hot!   There is a small gift shop, where I bought a PHX Christmas ornament to take home since I visited. There's also a kiosk where you can print your boarding pass/plane ticket, which was great, very convenient.   This hotel has a nice pool, although I didn't use it, and the gym is great. Lots of weight machines, free weights, a few weighted bars (not heavy weights), and tons of cardio equipment with attached TVs. There are headphones you can borrow in the gym and leave in a basket where they clean them. The gym also provides great towels for you to use and  there's a water station in there. Hyatt hotels have the *best* gyms.   Our conference rate price included wifi, which was fast, and the price was right. If you are attending a conference in PHX, this is definitely the hotel to stay at if possible.

My coworker and I are staying at the Hyatt for a technical communications conference, and we ate here yesterday for lunch. She had a cheeseburger and I had the Asian Sesame salad. The prices for food aren't bad, but the drink prices are a bit steep (they do have a happy hour, at least... but neither of us got drinks).   The food was fine, although it took a little while for it to come out to us. The service, on the other hand, was really off. The poor waitress had tons of tables to take care of, and our water ran out, and when our checks came, it was almost like she threw them at us (weird). The salad I had was mostly iceberg lettuce with tons of noodles, but the portions were good for the money. I really expected better service and probably wouldn't eat here again.

I really wasn't a fan of Einstein's, but it's location inside the Hyatt was great. Very convenient for a quick breakfast if you're staying at the hotel. The coffee I had was good, but a few times during our conference, they ran out of coffee in the mornings, probably due to high demand.

My Big Fat Greek Restaurant is delicious. I went here tonight with my coworker since we were in town for a conference. It is within walking distance to the conference center and near lots of restaurants and a few shops. We ate outside with a beautiful view of fountains.   I had the vegetarian moussaka, which came with rice and also veggies. The moussaka was great, it contains eggplant, potatoes, cheese, spinach, and sauce. It was really hot when it came out too. The rice is a yellow rice and has a few carrots in it. The veggies were carrots, broccoli and zucchini. It was really good. My friend had the caprese salad, which was pretty substantial. I thought it would be more like an appetizer but it was pretty big and filling, she really enjoyed it. I really wanted to try the baklava but the entrees were really filling and the prices are very affordable for dinner.   The staff was nice, seemed very attentive. All the food that came out to the tables near us looked delicious. The waters we got with our order were huge too, they definitely make sure you stay hydrated in the dry heat of PHX. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're here at the convention center.

When we travel, we like visiting local dives, so when my husband and I were in Charlotte for the Thunder Road Marathon, we hit Pinky's for some pre-race grub. I asked a bunch of friends where to eat locally, and whoever suggested Pinky's had the right idea. We usually don't go for big chains, etc.   Plus, it was convenient to downtown and had a parking lot- plus very little wait. Score!   I had the Nature Boy, which was a veggie burger. The burger was topped with cheese and roasted red peppers (interesting burger topping), and I got them to add spinach as well instead of iceberg lettuce. It was served on a sesame seed bun and pretty delicious- very large burger and filling, but I didn't leave overly stuffed.   There is an entirely vegetarian and vegan menu, you may need to ask for it, but it's *huge*. Anyone from a vegan to a carnivore can find something to eat at Pinky's and enjoy it.   Hubs had some wings and the "white trash burger" and seemed to enjoy it. Make sure to try the sirarcha ranch sauce- it's great. Also the prices here are incredibly cheap. It's really a steal, both of us ate for just over $20 and that almost never happens. The entrees do not come with sides but you can easily order and split some.   My only gripe was that everything was disposable, not the best for the environment. I'm sort of a hippie, but I really wish I had my burger on a plate rather than in a disposable basket. The cups/bar glasses were the only non-disposable things.   Pinky's decor is pretty amazing too- a fun VW bug outside and one on the roof, plus neat stickers and signs inside. All your senses get fed here, not just your tastebuds. Definitely check it out if you're in Downtown Charlotte.

I know it's in an airport, but I absolutely did not care for this pizza. The pizza was very expensive, and there are only a few options. I asked for a veggie pizza and the lady told me they didn't have that, so I had to get the SOP and opt for no sausage. The pizza set me back $16 and wasn't filling. If you want a pizza with toppings, you have to pay $2 per topping, even on a personal pizza. I know the workers don't set the prices but the service wasn't that great either. They make your pizza, then call your name out to get it, but if you're not listening really close, you won't hear them call you.   Also very few seating options. We had to sit at a high bar type table, which is okay but if you can't sit at a bar due to limited mobility, keep that in mind that there are few booths, so you might want to take your pizza to a chair near your gate to eat it.
