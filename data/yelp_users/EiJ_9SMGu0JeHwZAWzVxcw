Our little crew was looking for a fun and different place to have a birthday lunch celebration. Zinc fit the bill perfectly. This french bistro is nestled in the center of Kierland Commons, well suited for a tasty shopping intermission. My two girlfriends and I each got something from a different section of the menu ( salad, sandwich, and entree) and shared a side of the mac and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was superb. Our food came quickly and our server was friendly, funny, and helpful.   My recommends: The Basiled Chicken and Brie Sanwich Mac and Cheese  We were even treated to a nice Brandy Alexander in honor of my friends birthday.   Definitely worth many many visits in the future!

Fountain Hills is an oasis in the desert, marked visibly by its world famous namesake. Quiet and serene, the town feels like a entirely different world bordering the hustle and bustle of some of the larger cities in the phoenix metropolitan area.   A golfers paradise, Fountain Hills offers multiple highly rated courses with greens worth the drive. However golf isn't the only reason to cross the border into town. Local eateries provide a wide range of style, price range, and atmospheres to choose from. In addition, twice a year, the town becomes a mecca of arts and crafts enthusiasts, when it hosts the Fountain Hills Arts and Crafts Fair.  While its reputation leans towards that of a retirement community, Fountain Hills has proven a wonderful place to raise a family. Tight knit school systems provide the foundation to promote long lasting relationships between students and faculty, while ensuring a multifaceted education. With well maintained parks, local sports organizations and outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy a safe and beautiful place to participate in a variety of activities. Jungle gyms and small water parks provide hours of entertainment for the whole family.   Fountain Hills is the well needed escape from the growing concrete jungle surrounding the phoenix area while still being tuned into the culture and vibrancy of the cities it neighbors.

I absolutely loved my experience working with Alphagraphics. My task required I have 1000 flyers produced and ready for display the following day. I called the Alphagraphics located on Scottsdale Road in Old Town, after fruitlessly researching the Kinko's online options, expecting to be quoted with an outrageous price that would likely include some form of artistic fee. I was relieved to find the exact opposite. I spoke with someone directly over the phone, told them what I needed, how I wanted them printed, and described the paper style/texture I was looking for. They quoted a price for me immediately and I was shocked how low it was, especially compared to all the prices I was seeing on Kinko's site. I told them I would call them right back to run the price by my boss and as soon as I got off the phone, I thought to myself that the price couldn't be right and I must have forgotten to mention something. I called back to ensure they heard me say I wanted it in COLOR, and if the price included cutting. And sure enough they were both included in my original price. They produced a draft for me to double check first then had them all printed in two hours! I was very please with the quality and efficiency.   I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a quick easy printing solution.

I will preface this review by stating that it is an evaluation of the bar portion of this establishment. I have yet to actually eat in the restaurant or even wander through it. With that said.....  AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!  I had a very pleasant evening at this Hotel Vally Ho adjacent watering hole. The service was fast and friendly, offering suggestions and reviews. I indulged in a burger on the Happy Hour menu that was absolutely delicious. It came on flat bread with a melt in your mouth cheese accent and sweet potato fries to top it off. A definite winner in my book. My indulgences did not end there..... I introduce you to the swizzle. Long Island-esk in nature, its a delicious, refreshing, and quite a bang for your buck drink. The perfect economically savvy choice to start your evening whether you are hitting the town hard or simply plan on wetting your whistle with one drink.   I want to make special note of the entertainment provided by the live band that plays every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night from 8pm-11pm. They are a phenomenal trio that provide the bar with a fun and hip vibe. If you have a song in mind, it is likely they can provide. They are open to requests and love interacting with the crowd. You also don't feel overwhelmed by the music due to the open air facility and conversation is actually possible, unlike many other live band bars.   My first experience with this bar only left me searching for anyone and everyone I could drag along with me to share in the experience. Can't wait to go again!

I decided to venture outside of the office kitchen and explore the mysterious Cafe in the Culinary Institute that I had heard so much about. Though their selection is small and often random, the food was delicious. I chose the hot dog ( not very adventurous, I know), but paired it with a delicious potato salad and piece of foccacia. The Foccacia definitely stole the show. So much so that my friend who joined me went up for two more pieces. I would go just to get the bread for delicious sandwich fixings. A cheap and quick alternative to the sometimes time consuming and expensive Cafe Conmigo.   I have also heard rumors that they have a tasty breakfast burrito. Yum!

While the food was OK, the service definitely left something to be desired. We had multiple people serving our party, which made it confusing as to who we could actually ask when we needed something. The initial waitress was friendly and helpful but after she delivered our first round we lost sight of her. Our second server we all mistook for the bus boy, and as it turns out was a far more accurate description. After about three people ordered drinks his eyes glossed over and he admittedly couldn't even remember the second persons drink. We would have valued his honesty if he had not also been visibly irritated that such a large group dare order from him.   The service rant aside, Bogey's hosts a pretty fun trivia night and there specials are plentiful and worthwhile. The bar is large and spacious offering outdoor seating and shuffleboard ( a personal favorite of mine). While I wouldn't go out of my way to frequent this semi dive bar, if that's where to group wants to go, I wouldn't object.

Bike cabs beware! You've got nothing on this rig!   Tour de Tavern is a tribute to tipsy teamwork and a perfect way to host a unique group event. As "pedalers" on their inaugural tour, we enjoyed the celebrity treatment of cruising down the winding streets of Old Town Scottsdale as onlookers snapped photos and cheered us on!  We rocked out to top 40 hits and, by special request, our Lonely Island favorites on their awesome sound system. Our guides were flexible and let our party run the show. If we needed more time for let's say...... an impromptu horseback ride in front of Shotgun Betty's, they were more than happy to wait.   As an added bonus everyone gets to burn off some of those unwanted cocktail calories in between your favorite watering holes. If you are concerned that after a few stops (and a few shots) your legs might lose some of that forward momentum, there are a few coveted "non pedaling" seats in the back of the bike. We all compromised with a friendly and fair rotation system.   Our tour guides were helpful, accommodating, and entertaining. They even proved to be exceedingly patient upon discovering that we did in facts have "that guy" in our group.   If you're saying to yourself,  "Such a marvelous experience could only cost an arm and least the majority of a leg" then you would be wrong! With the cost of gas being substituted for sheer earth friendly man power, our group of fifteen people spent less than $30 bucks each for the experience.  But wait, there's more! Included in this price are all the amazing special deals that Tour de Tavern exclusively brings you at select bars along the route. On our tour we were offered drinks specials ranging from $3 to ONE PENNY!  I say this in all caps because it's ONE PENNY!  So next time you are planning an event, I recommend Tour de Tavern 100%!  "Look Ma! No hands!"
