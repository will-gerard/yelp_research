My family and I were in town for Family Week visiting my kid sister at ASU. We came here for dinner before we all headed home. Dinner was great, portions were huge, and no one complained about anything they ordered. We sat for quite a while enjoying the last few hours of our trip. We ordered, various sashimi, the dragon roll, rainbow roll, beef teriyaki and a tootsie roll.    Only thing was that the bathroom is shared with the smoke shop next door, so being that we sat at one of the rear tables, every time that door opened and shut, the strong smell of incense comes in and out of the restaurant.

Friends and I made a trip to Las Vegas for a friends' 30th birthday during this past weekend, February 16th - 19th. We rented a suite in the West Tower at The Luxor for the weekend and on Saturday evening we reserved a table at this club, LAX.   One of their representatives approached us as we were dining at the caf√© downstairs offering us a deal for a table that night and it was a two-for-one bottle deal, which we took advantage of. The deal was that we would get a bottle for free, however we would still be obligated to pay the service and tax on the second bottle, which we happily agreed to. Since there were 13 of us all together, 7 girls, 6 guys, the total bill came out to about $760.03.   Our waitress's name was Christina. When we arrived, we were kindly helped and checked at the door and escorted to our table. We were seated for about 15-20 minutes before our set-up was completed. Christina had brought over the tab and went over it all with my friend. He decided to upgrade our bottles to Hennessey and Grey Goose for an additional $110.00 fee. Another 10 - 15 minutes later, Christina finally brought our bottles to the table. When she began pouring drinks, she started with the Hennessey. She peeled off the wrapper and poured drinks. However, when she brought the Grey Goose bottle (which most of us were drinking) the bottle came to the table WITHOUT the wrapper on it. All she had to do was uncork the bottle. I was a bartender for two years and I know what the bottle looks like packaged out of the box. There is a blue wrapper that needs to be peeled off before the cork is removable. There was no wrapper when she brought it to the table. After the server had poured the first round of shots, I began serving the drinks, as there were so many people with us. We finished the bottle of Grey Goose within the first hour we were there and no one had gotten drunk. The vodka was heavily diluted and every one of us that drank it noticed it after not having felt any effects of the liquor, whatsoever.   I do not recommend coming to this club, as the other people posting are also right about the table situation... the whole top floor was EMPTY, no one was up there. But all the small booths on the bottom were over crowded and almost all filled. With the price you pay, you'd expect to be put upstairs in a bigger more spacious table. IMO, of course.   Oh, and the 1 star was because they kept our supply of pineapple juice unlimited.

My family and I came into this salon / spa a few weeks ago for Family Week at ASU. We got two women's pedicures, my dad got a men's pedicure and men's manicure... total bill was $155.00 (not including tips). My little sister's mani / pedi turned out awesome and her girl was super friendly and made several attempts to interact and chit chat. My dad's girl was super sweet, funny and we all learned a ton about her and where she came from. My girl however was really quiet and I don't recall saying a word to me. Also, I got like a 45 second foot massage with my pedicure, which was kind of sucky. I was really looking forward to it since we'd been walking around all day / weekend. The ladies at the front desk were incredibly sweet and social with us since there were five of us in there for at least two hours. The place was super clean and I loved the all white furniture / black uniforms style going on. Not sure when I'll be back in town, but if I am back in town, I wouldn't mind stopping by (hopefully getting a better massage out of it).

Came here on game day last Saturday from out of town visiting for Family Week... the place was a bit crowded, but not too crazy yet. We went inside and unfortunately our bartender was really rude. Just no "hi" "hello", just that upwards head nod of "what can i get you" which is fine and all but like I said, it was a bit crowded, so I couldn't see the beers on tap. I asked for a Corona, he said he didn't have that - okay, no problem. My dad politely asked "do you have any mexican beer?" and he responded, "all i have." and pointed to the beer taps, again, that we couldn't see (I'm a whopping 5 ft 3.25 inches). So I had to look around to see if they had beers listed on a board or something, to which he visibly got annoyed. Eventually we both ordered two blue moons... second star was for the tasty and quick wings we ordered. Lacking in the friendly / customer service dept.

The food here was some of the best I've had, not just in an airport, but just in general. My boyfriend and I had brunch here before our flight out and we were more than happy with the taste, quality and service of our entire experience.
