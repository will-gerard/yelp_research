I love this place.  Now it is this location that I enjoy, not the other ones.  This Good Egg has very nice servers and the Host/Hostess are very nice too.  It is very clean and the breakfast tacos are great.  My girlfriend had pancakes with peanut butter, chocolate chips and honey butter.  After my initial shock at her order(I have never seen her order pancakes) I was impressed with them.  They were delicious.    They even offer large plastic cups for your drinks to take with you.  I know, I know.  Big deal.  But it really is a bid deal.  Very thoughtful.    They will remain on the top of my list for breakfast ;)

We went to RA on Saturday for date night.  Wow, were we surprised at out visit.  We have eaten there before and were not disappointed, but this time was not a treat.  We arrived at 6:30 and they were about half full.  We thought they would be packed for a Saturday night.  The music that was playing was so loud that it made you flinch.  We sat at a 2 top and had to yell across the table the entire time.  Not fun.  When our server did finally arrive, she was pleasant.  However, she could not answers our questions and had to keep going to the kitchen for information.  I am not talking about crazy questions either, I just wanted to know if their green tea had caffeine or not.    We eat sushi often so we are always eager to try something new.  We ordered 4 items.  The first one we received was something we didn't order.  We didn't realize it until the correct one came next.  No worries, not a big deal.  Every plate was brought to us by a different person, which I appreciate the teamwork and making sure our food gets to us freshly made.  The sushi was warm, room temp at best.  The flavors were bland, even the on with jalapenos in it.    We couldn't even tell anyone that we were not please with our food because no on came back to check on us.  When our server finally did come back to drop the check, she asked us how everything was and we told her it was not delicious and we would have rather told her that 30 minutes earlier but she was MIA.  She looked embarrassed and offered us a dessert.  I told her that if we didn't like the dinner, why would we even want to try a dessert.  She spun around, flipped her long hair and walked off into the sunset.  There are far too many great local restaurants to eat at and support to waste your time and money on mediocre.  So now we look for another great sushi restaurant that would like our business.

We were excited to try this place.  We planned it out for today.  We arrived about 11:45.  Perfect timing because right after we got there, it filled up.  When we pulled into the parking lot, quite frankly I was alarmed.  Not what I expected.  Total dive and not inviting at all from the outside.  But we decided to go in anyway.  The young man behind the counter was very welcoming and helpful.  Offered us tastes and answered all of our questions.  I decided on a combination plate of white rice, hengrenade chicken, black bean tostada and black beans, and my partner had chicken fried rice, jade chicken burrito, refried beans and teriyaki chicken.    We went to get our drinks and plastic forks and packets of soy sauce and salt then sat down.  the food came our fairly fast and the employee was very nice.  The food was pretty good.  My chicken was very good, the tostadas were great and you can't go wrong with white rice.  The Cuban black beans were probably my favorite.  My partner fell in love with her jade chicken burrito.  The chicken fried rice was delicious and the refried beans were good too.  The teriyaki chicken was nice and moist, but the teriyaki sauce was not hot and it was poured over the top of a pile of chicken.  It was not bad, but had too much of a ginger flavor four our taste.    The d√©cor is quite lacking, and nothing to write home about, but it was not dirty.  Just old and bland.    We are excited to bring our daughters here to try it.  Over all, we are glad we found this place.  We will try many other things they have.

I cannot even begin to tell you how disgusted we were with our experience here.  We came here for our daughter's 18th birthday.  First, it took 15 minutes for our server to come to our table.  She was very energetic,  so we thought, "Great! There is hope here!"   WRONG.  We ordered appetizers and dinner and it took forever.  We decided 20 minutes in that we should get a cocktail,  but no one cam back to our table.  I had to get up and go to the bartender on duty to ask him to send someone over to refill our iced tea, soda and water.  He did.  Then we got our food.  Not how we ordered it, but it was delivered by an expeditor, so he had no idea.  No one came back to check.  It was not busy, so there was no excuse for this.  We couldn't even get our bill!!  I had to request our check from another stranger!  This place was ridicilous.  I requested to speak to the manager on our way out, and our server actually flipped out and wanted to "discuss" it with me.    We spent 80 dollars on our dinner.  It was absolutly not acceptable!
