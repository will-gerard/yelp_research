I was very surprised to see that this location is a great advancement from the Tempe location. I love the Tempe location (due to it being the best in proximity), but everything about this location is better.   As far as the food goes, it's just as "top-notch" as Tempe. All the food is hot and fresh, and they are constantly bringing in warm bread and new refills.  The chicken curry is even better with the addition of red and green bell peppers, but everything else is just as tasty.  The building the restaurant is located in is perfect. It looks like it was built for this restaurant alone, and I gotta say I was impressed. There was even an Indian Grocery inside which was cool to look around in.  I had a great experience here and I'm sure anyone else who enjoys Indian Cuisine would as well.

This little coffee house is great. I didn't actually have a coffee, but I definitely enjoyed the pastries they had. There were three different kinds: chocolate dipped coconut macaroon, raspberry and chocolate rugulah. The macaroon was amazing, especially with a tall glass of ice cold milk. I also enjoyed the art that decorated the walls... pretty cool place.

I bought a universal watch band, and at the time didn't have it adjusted to fit me correctly. So I walk into this Target today and ask the women at the jewelry counter if she could help me adjust the band. She informs me that "they have taken away all their tools" and "they don't perform that service anymore". Way to go Target...

Five stars all around:  The service is amazing. The food is perfectly presented and full of distinct flavors. The atmosphere is upbeat and relaxed AT THE SAME TIME! I don't know how they did it, but they figured out the recipe for a perfect wine bar...

When it comes to Asian style privately owned restaurants, most of them run into each other for me. Thai Lahna, on the contrary, is in a league of it's own. The scene is what any would expect, and the service is curt, but the food is what you're coming for, right? The portions are generous, with no shortage of protein. The sauces are so far above average, it makes the entrees at other local restaurants taste like happy meals. I'm not kidding here, if they only offered their sauces over rice I would still go as much as possible. But let's not detract from the content, all ingredients are cooked to perfection. The bamboo shoots have never been too firm. The chicken has never been too tough. The scallions never wilted.  Down sides: table-side manner (servers are all about the business here), only canned sodas, long wait when it's busy (but it's hard to hate on a place that is too busy), how full you are for hours after leaving... ENJOY!!!

I had experienced first hand why it's not a good idea to slide down a banister drunk, and cracked the crystal on my favorite watch. After finally getting around to getting it fixed, I contacted The Watch Repair Company:  12/12/09: I call the shop asking about a price quote and ETA on when it would be fixed. I'm told it would be $20, and it would be finished Wednesday (12/16/09).  12/23/09: Almost a week after I was told the watch would be fixed I call the shop. I am told that the watch is not finished but it would be the next day (12/24/09, a.k.a. Christmas Eve). Surprised that he would work on Christmas Eve, I am told the watch would be ready between 1-2pm.   12/24/09 3:01 PM: I call the shop, and am told that he just needs to get the watch put back together but it would be ready by 4:30. Frustrated I let him know I would be there at that time.  After The Watch Repair Company had fallen through twice, I was starting to get pretty frustrated with their complete lack of contact or clarity on when my watch would be fixed. The only guy that runs this place is almost completely impossible to understand, mumbling  in sort of a primitive way. No matter, I was especially excited to have my watch back.  12/24/09 4:30 PM: I walk into the shop and let him know I am there to pick up my watch. He pulls it out of a sleeve mumbling "I got it cleared on out, I can give you a call when the crystal comes in," and hands me the same exact thing I had given him two weeks ago. The crystal was still cracked. After all that, nothing had been done. I am completely speechless, grab the watch, and head for the door. He mumbles "There's no charge on that."  I still have no Idea what to say. What a complete waste of time. I have absolutely no idea how this place is still in business.

My standards are pretty low while extremely hung over wearing the same clothes I participated in crazy drunken debauchery the night before. But I still left Bagel Nosh feeling like I wished I had gone to IHOP next door.  I ordered the $7 Arizona Classic: an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese on the bagel of my choice. The quality was pretty much on par with a McBagel McSandwich but was twice the price. The bacon was more like bacon bits and the egg was thin and tasteless. There was nothing wrong with the service, but the prices were way too high for what I was eating.  My friends had ordered a bagel with spread that looked better. So I guess the rule of thumb here would be to order a bagel only. I would definitely leave other breakfast food concoctions to another restaurant.

Over the past five years I went from being the skinny, young, semi-sober teen checking out the hot chicks to the chubby, old, still semi-sober weirdo creeping out the hot chicks here.   But in the words of the late-great-now-lame Matthew McConaughey: "I get older...But they stay the same age"...

Out of all the different locations of buffets like Sweet Tomatoes, Souper Salad, and Cici's, this is my favorite.  The food here is always fresh and tasty, while others can have a general theme of bland. I mean, we all know buffets are the best because when you don't know what you want, they have everything (salad with every topping imaginable, six different soups, pizza, pasta, mac and cheese, ica cream, and much more).  At about $10 for the food and $2 for a drink, the price is a little more than I would hope for. But as I said before, they have EVERYTHING and you can literally get as much of it as you would like.   While I usually hit up Sweet Tomatoes for a large amount of decent food, I imagine it would laso be great for students with home work (I don't think there's a time limit or anything) or friends/family with children.

This is the watering hole closest to my humble abode, so I may be a little biased, but I love this place. It's exactly what I would picture when given the phrase "hole in the wall bar", and that's what I'm looking for when I just want to relax and unwind or even pregame.  The bartender/server/foodrunner/barback that basically runs the place (I seriously don't know what the owners would do without her) is so nice and a very cool person to interact/chat with.   The food, while not as extremely diversified as it could be, is always prepared when you order it and comes out hot and delicious.   They have a cool side patio to smoke on. The bar also falls right on the Orbit route so it's just a quick lift back home or to a different location.

It took our server here AN HOUR AND A HALF (90 minutes) to get the bill separated.  Our server was visibly and audibly having a psychological breakdown, unable to handle a party of 10 with appetizers and drinks for each person. She sat down at the table multiple times, drawing diagrams and equations so complex and confusing I can't even imagine. She was openly complaining to us about her other tables and constantly delivering drinks to the wrong person.   This one star is strictly due to the service. The food and drinks are decent quality and moderately priced so in any other situation I'm sure it would've been three even four stars....

I'm heating up the leftovers as I type. This place is amazing.  My experience here was as good as it gets. The atmosphere is great with folded cloth napkins, big LCD TV's, and spacious booths. The service was fantastic. Our server actually asked me if I wanted to have a "to go" cup of this special hot sauce they make. Hell yeah I would.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are great. Georgeann G and I enjoyed the Singapore Noodles (angel hair, shrimp, and pork in a curry sauce) and the Yum Gai (spicy minced beef served cool over a salad of vegetables). Both dishes were amazing and the special hot sauce our server suggested was a great compliment to the already vibrant flavors.   I wish I would have caught our servers name because he was really a master of his craft.   This is definitely a place to check out if you haven't already.

This was one of the first places I was a huge fan of. Even before I was of age I would try to sneak my way in! There's good reason for all the hype around this place.   The food here is AMAZING! I've had numerous different dishes here and they've all come out deliciously cooked to perfection. My favorite appetizer here is the hummus, which comes with warm and moist pita bread which compliments the smooth yet spicy hummus excellently. When it comes to the entree it's hard to stray from the grilled salmon BLT, which comes on a grain-covered soft wheat bread that melts in your mouth. The prices are great for how spectacular the food is, although expect to cough up a solid twenty per person for an appetizer, entree, and beers. And speaking of beer... There's no problem savoring each flavoring. Yeah, if you know me you probably can't imagine me saying that, but damn they're good. I like the Raj IPA because it's so high in alcohol, and after two or three I'm on my ass (DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE!! TEMPE PD WILL HAVE YOU ON YOUR ASS FASTER).   The service has always been good. I've even become friends with some of the wait staff here, chatting it up outside the bar, because they're such good people. Always perfectly on time with the food and drinks, there's no way I can imagine anyone being disappointed.   As far as atmosphere, it's what any bar/restaurant owner would dream of. Right in the heart of Tempe, but tucked away as to not get annoying with ASU pride, there are hundreds of different entertainment venues close by  that would be good for a date or just a night out with friends. They also have the best patio seating in all of phoenix (that I've seen).   This staple of Phoenix is one that MUST be experienced...

I am always very satisfied with all aspects of my dining experience at Sushi 101.   The sushi itself is very good. The rolls are always tight. The nigiri are always fresh, generous portions (spicy scallop...omg).  The service is always fantastic. Who I am assuming is the owner (she looks the part if you know what I mean) is always up front to greet with a big smile. The servers and managers are very attentive and nice, also.   The happy hour prices are amazing! I usually sit down (with Georgeann G.) to a meal of three rolls, four nigiri, and an appetizer and the bill is always a reasonable amount (usually around twenty each with tip). If you were to go in and keep it to one roll and one nigiri you could easily spend less than ten dollars.  The scenery is always great too. There's a really great vibe about this restaurant with all the young college life around in the heart of ASU.   I'm a big fan and I'm sure most would be... definitely a great place to check out.

Best breakfast in town! But enough about the food, I'm writing to regale you with tales of my encounters with the sexiest servers I've ever seen. I don't what exactly it is, but whomever does the hiring at this joint deserves a firm handshake. The servers all wear skin tight black workout pants (yeah you know the ones) that accentuate every beautiful curve of the buttocks. The best view can be had while sitting at the bar (it's wonderfully positioned right behind the expo line (where they put the food for you non-industry peeps)). These gorgeous women put the servers at hooters to shame. Honestly, the food could be total crap and I would still enjoy it with a smile on my face...

Great Lunch buffet... for some odd reason when I wake up hungover the only thing I want is plate after plate of Indian food. They have the usual assortment of curry dishes, vegetables, and bbq'd meats, as well as sauces for the naan. The best thing about this restaurant (bumping it to a 4 star instead of 3) is that: they refill my drinks when they're not even halfway down; and they bring around fresh, hot bread once when you sit down and again halfway through the meal. The price is normal for a lunch buffet, and everything else is what you would expect.

A true diamond in the rough! I was very impressed by this restaurant, and also surprised that I had never even seen it. I'm not sure if the complex is new but its pretty well camouflaged.   The food was VERY good. It came out in large portions and very quickly. They offer the usual Mediterranean fare, I ordered the Gyro plate, Georgeann G had the lamb tongue sandwich, and we each also had a stuffed grape leaf. The stuffed grape leaves we served hot (which was a first) but they were HUGE compared to others I've had. The Meat was cooked to perfection (the lamb tongue was surprisingly very tasty) and the sides were freshly prepared as well.   Words of advice: go with the sandwich instead of a plate. The plate came with about 2 pounds of rice that was completely not needed (and the total price would've been much less if ordered separately). If you still want more, add a side salad or something.  The prices were very good and the service was nothing to complain about. It was hard to resist the baklava by the register, and we ended up taking a piece of cashew baklava to go (which was heavenly).   I'm glad I've had a chance to check this place out, and I will definitely go back.

Rally's...what can I say? I'm so so so so sorry for ever going to the Burger King down the street! I didn't know you were there! Tucked all in the corner there, with the black and white sign, no big neons or nothing!   Baby you know I love your Big Bufford! It is really big, but baby you know I like it that way! NO... I LOVE it that way. C'mon!  You know when I dig deep into your fries that I love you! I don't know why you doubt me... the McDouble was just a phase! I was young and stupid...   I was wrong. I love you. I'm sorry...

This location of Buffalo Exchange is amazing.   I usually start by satisfying my denim addiction and peruse through the jeans. They have all the top designer brands (True Religion, Rock & Republic, William Rast, Seven) found for over two hundred dollars at Nordstom. After I finish it's straight to the fitting rooms because there's no way I could carry around 40 pounds of jeans very long. Sometimes the staff will ask if you'd like to start a little collection back there while you look.. tricky little buggers.   The prices are great and the condition of the clothing is always pretty good to excellent. I can't think of any times I didn't get a friendly hello on my way in the door.   I've had quite the good luck in selling items to this location also, which is great considering I go in expecting them to not take anything.

I have never had a better burger than the burger at Chuck Box. I try so hard to recreate the awesomeness that is the combination of the lean 80/20 beef (bought from a local Scottsdale butcher, and hand pounded using old Mexican preparations), crisp greens (or grilled green chillies/pineapple), and lightly toasted bun; but my efforts are futile. It cannot be done. I have to admit, I worked at this run-down looking little shack, but it wasn't until I recognized the "flavor" that I knew I had to be part of a legend. Don't expect a cute little smile when you walk in the door, and don't wear your sunday best. Rest assured that anything you order will be the best you'd ever have. A guide to ordering at The Chuck Box: White or wheat? Chicken (Plain, Hot n' Spicy, BBQ, or Teriyaki) or Beef (Little Once (1/5lb), Big One (13/lb), or Great Big One (1/2lb))? Cheese (American, Swiss, Pepperjack, or Cheddar)? Bacon? Green Chile? Pineapple? Guac? (believe it or not you then dress it up yourself at the best condiment bar). And on the SIDE: Fries, Onion Rings, Mushrooms, Zucchini, Jalapeno Poppers, Chicken Strips, Chili? ......Man I want some right now....

As a fellow pianist I feel like I have to help get the word out about this place. Obviously from the number of reviews it's pretty well known, but because of its location and main attraction (dueling pianos) many outside of Tempe haven't heard about it.   These entertainers are truly some of the most talented I've ever seen. Not only can they play you any tune you request, they can deliver it with a generous amount of raunchy comedy. Seeing them expand their performance to the guitar, bass, and synthesizer are also equally impressive.  It's such a great time taking part in singing along with hundreds of other people, too. I can't say enough about how much fun it is watching them work. If there is only one venue you should visit while on Mill Ave, this is it.   As far as the bar goes, the prices are decent and they have a wide variety of options. I definitely wouldn't come here if I were trying to hold a conversation with anyone, it's more of the place you go after you've had a few (unless you get there early). This is one of the many places that  consistently charge a cover, which is a pain for me because I rarely ever have cash. Which brings up another aspect of Big Bang... if you plan on having your request played for you, you better tip well. Otherwise, you won't hear your song and don't expect the money back (but if you gave a crap tip, its the least you could do for such entertainment). It does get pretty packed in here, which at times can be uncomfortable. If you want a good table, arrive early.   Again if you're not a frequent traveler to Mill Ave, make sure The Big Bang is on your list of stops. If you skip it you'll definitely regret it...

Perfezione! This little restaurant is the epitome of fine Italian dining!  There's nothing more genuine than Tomaso's. We called this restaurant when they were scheduled to close in a half hour, but when we expressed how excited we were to enjoy a meal there the manager agreed to stay open until we had finished.   Upon arrival the door was held open and we were warmly greeted and seated amongst a few other late night diners who were finishing up. The waiter had just finished rowing his gondola from Venice, his accent thick like a finely formulated Bolognese sauce. He delivered the fine red wine we ordered like a master sommelier and took our requests for appetizers patiently. La vita bella!  After we sampled four of their finest appetizers (which were all prepared to perfection), we decided it was time to move into the main course. There were many different dishes ordered: seafood diablo pasta, grilled fish, steak, lobster tail, shrimp, lamb, sea scallops! Everything was cooked with an excellence that could only be matched by the almighty himself. I enjoyed the Tuscan Mixed Grill, which itself was one of the greatest dishes I've ever had. I did, in the tradition of Italian family-style dining, HAVE to try a little bit of everything though...  Topped off with a little dessert dessert wine, this meal could not have been served or prepared better. Tomaso's is a great place to go if you want to get the best Italian food possible.

While I don't falter often from my usual order, everything from Pita Jungle that I've had has been great. I usually get the half jalapeno/half roasted red bell pepper hummus followed by the glazed chicken lavosh. The lavosh is absolutely amazing, toasted in their wood fire oven and topped with generous portions of the honey glazed chicken and feta cheese. The half green tea/half lemonade arnold palmer is my refreshment of chioce, refreshing my taste buds and preparing them for another round of the excellent food.   The servers here are great too, but I don't mean in a white-glove waiter sort of way. These are the people that are fresh off the bong, and honestly, I'm surprised the food even makes it to the table intact. Don't get me wrong, If they were to change this I may not frequent as much. I enjoy my fare share of baked-out-of-their-mind servers, there's just less stress!    The only negative thing I can think of about this place is that the dishes are a little too expensive to make it a weekly stop and the tables are pretty crowded together. Other than that I've never seen anything to complain about.   I also love the ever-changing art from local talent! Very chill place...

When I'm in the mood to muscle through a sea of yegger-lovin' collar-poppers to get a drink, I usually go to Dirty Pretty.   The venue itself is pretty decent: a large main area surrounded by plush private tables (think: a bigger version of Zuma), a good sized patio with tables, and a wrap around bar that is accessible from anywhere but outside.    Now I may be a little bias on this one because I don't believe I've gone when it's not one of their "free Effin vodka" nights (from 9-11), but holy hell I've never gotten so smashed on ten dollars. The bar tenders are busy as hell, but throw them a nice bone each time and they'll keep the vodka flowin.

Since my days of visiting HQ when it was on Farmer I've had a great experience here.   I've purchased merchandise from the conventional glassware (excellent quality and great price) to more obscure Marilyn Monroe screen print wall piece (it was a gift...).  The staff has always been extremely knowledgeable and helpful.  It doesn't get any better, my recommendation everytime for anyone in need of a head shop in Tempe...

This isn't the type of place that I could afford to eat at once a week, but there can't be a better place to go for a celebratory meal or special occasion.   A group of friends and family and I went here, and I gotta say it lived up to it's reputation. I expected a snooty server, but the one that came to the table was actually really cool. We started with an amazing tower of seafood appetizer complete with fist sized shrimp and lobster claws.   Then there was the steak. Every single cut sounded delicious, but one stood out for me... the twelve ounce bone-in Filet Mignon. It was like a little slice of heaven. Perfectly prepared and excellently presented, it could've been cut with a spoon. The sides were served family style and were also very good (asparagus and lobster mashed potatoes). The server explained the cooking process and everything about how they obtain and prepare the meat, which was very cool.   This was one of the classiest restaurants I've ever been to and I hope I get to go back soon...

Usually when you roll something this good, it's illegal. While I wouldn't consider it authentic Mexican (more like Mexican style), It's the best thing to get for the price. I get so excited moving along in the line, watching as they scoop the delectable ingredients onto the warm tortilla. There are few things better than seeing a middle aged Mexican woman muscle the burrito into its final shape. When they hand me that baby sized burrito I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning. It's the perfect amount of food and always leaves me satisfied.

I have been to La Bocca a few times now, but my most recent visit down to this Mill Ave pizzeria warranted a good review.   Buying "groupons" is something that Georgeann G's do best.  At the early stages of her groupon binge she scored a deal at LBUP+WB. We finally were able to put it to good use, choosing "The Mouth" as the location of our Saturday night.   We were greeted by a couple lovelies, and escorted to a little table in the back by the bar. The surroundings are warm and upbeat, with things that us gangsters refer to as "wood-grain interior" and "killer beats". I happened to notice that they have a movie projector, which in my case was running the ultra hip "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" with John Barrymore.   Our server promptly arrived to take drink orders and greet us. Dulea, I believe, was very helpful and had great suggestions (I tried to remember her name so she could get credit). We decided not to drink so we could enjoy as many dishes and flavors as possible for a good price. However, I am one who can chug some Arnold Palmer and our server kept them coming (servers tell me not to apologize, but around the fifth I think they regret it).  We started with the brushetta "plank" which offers four of many different combination of unique ingredients. Results were amazing, but my favorites were the salmon-caper and the tomato-pesto (the latter a suggestion). Our main course was a combination of two, splitting a pizza and sandwich. Now the pizza could be better, but I like greasy ass Domino's the best so I won't jump into that can of tomato paste. All the ingredients tasted very fresh, the outer crust was just WAY too big. The sandwich was great, especially with the suggestion of their house bread instead of the usual bread. Ending with a flight of artisan ice cream may have been the proverbial seal on the deal. I highly recommend trying these out. The mint chocolate chip unbelievably tastes exactly like chewing an actual mint leaf, instead of the usual neon green store bought treat.   It's easy to see why this urban pizzeria plus wine bar has survived the dwindling economy on Mill Ave.  I'm sure La Bocca will greatly help rebuild a strong market, setting a high bar for service and quality.

This Hooters is nothing special. The location is the best thing about it, followed very distantly by the food, and then the servers.   Normally I would NEVER bad mouth the looks of a server, but I reserve the right to with Hooters since they are basically saying in the name "come here to ogle great looking women". I'd say about one out of ten servers is good looking, and one server I had here actually had what looked like a bacterial infection. I really feel bad saying this, but I could be saving someone the energy (I wish someone had done the same for me).   The food is slightly better than crap, very bland and overpriced. The prices on beer are absolutely ridiculous.   There are much better places to go on Mill Ave...

This car wash is great. Good price and friendly staff. The best part is that the use of the vacuums is included in the general wash. I am a big fan of washing my car at home by hand, there's nothing better than rubbing down my beautiful investment inch by inch (that's what she said?). However, I can never get the purdy shine I get from Clean Freak (maybe it's the air drying). After I ran my car through the auto-wash and spent some quality time vacuuming out the months of debris it looked as great as the day I bought it.

I am so happy this place just opened! Chances are if you're a fan of great sports bars you've been to one of their other locations, but this new location on Indian School is one to go out of the way for.  After entering, I first noticed that they did some great remodeling, knocking down all the walls and really opening the place up to show off the almost infinite amount of flat panel hi-def tv's. The hosts were comically over-inviting, and I'm pretty sure I heard 5 or 6 enthusiastic "HELLO!"'s, but that's the least of my worries when I enter an establishment. After being led to the booth (yes they were PACKED, but there's booths lining every wall) It must've taken 30 minutes to read through all the specials, and I believe there's only ONE HOUR THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DAY WHEN THERE ARE NO SPECIALS!   We ended up ordering better than average chips and fresh guac and the best wings (golden) I'd had in a while, and that's when I saw it... Four massive flat panel hi-def tv's set on TRANSFORMING ROBOTIC ARMS THAT PERIODICALLY SHIFT THEM FROM ONE MASSIVE TV STRUCTURE (showing one channel) TO FOUR SEPARATE TV's (with four different channels)!! I don't know who thought of that, or if it was an original idea, but it was a really cool touch.   Our servers were so nice and attentive, the food was fresh and generously portioned, and the overall experience was perfect.  It was great to get the same great things I had expected from Zipps...

Hole-in-the-Rock is a cave-like natural rock formation sculpted into the top of a sandstone butte in Phoenix's beautiful Papago Park. It's one of the most powerful scenic views in our city, and is the perfect place to showcase its exquisite landscape. Just a short hike up the butte and you'll find yourself in the amazing chamber sculpted over millions of years of wind and water erosion.   At sunset there are few locations that can rival its awesomeness. The hole faces south, giving a wonderful view over south Phoenix all the way to South Mountain.    Hole-in-the-Rock is truly one of the greatest attractions in our city and everyone would be blessed to experience it at least once.   No fee to enter. Bring a camera!

If you want to get some food but don't want to settle for being a "dollar menuaire", the crazy chicken is the place to go. I've had my fair share of encounters with crazy chicken: -my brother was once bitten in the arm by a chicken, and soon was able to lay eggs -after finding inspiration in a pleasantly plump mother clucker, my great uncle's dogs previous owner did (what was in his time) the first ever recorded "chicken dance" -I once took advice from a chicken in Wisconsin, and after pulling over to ask for directions, found myself in Canada.  Don't be weary. The two piece breast and wing meal (with a drink of course) is better than getting the best parking spot at work, and remembering when you leave ('cause everyone knows when you get that good spot and forget it SUCKS!). Help yourself to the freshly chopped/diced/picked/squeezed salsa bar while you're at it! Might as well....  You may need some extra tortillas, it's OK! they're only fifty cents! WIpe up with either the napkin-holders on each table or the individually wrapped wet naps and get on your way... you've got places to be...
