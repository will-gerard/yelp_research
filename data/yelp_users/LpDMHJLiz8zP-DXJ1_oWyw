Don't let the awesome decor and delicious smells fool you. HORRIBLE service and mediocre, over-priced food! We initially to the back patio to grab a table because the inside is very small and there weren't a lot of open tables. Chips and salsa were very good. Waiter got us our drinks and then he never came over again. We even asked another server if we could order our food because we had been waiting so long but we didn't get assistance.  Not ready to give up just yet, we decided to go inside and see if we could get better service. It was less crowded now so we were able to grab the only clean table. (There was one waitress serving all the tables - on a Saturday during prime dinner time). I ordered the chicken fajita plate. There were no peppers! In fajitas! Chicken was chewy and didn't have much flavor.   I could get better fajitas at Chilis. How sad!   My boyfriend ordered the shrimp enchiladas, but our server let us know 10 minutes after ordering that they ran out of shrimp.  My boyfriend ordered the veggie burrito, which was supposed to come smothered in their home-made red sauce. It wasn't. My boyfriend said it was very bland, and we were overcharged for our food. His burrito was (supposed to be) $10 and my fajita plate was $13.  Overall I am very disappointed because this place had such potential, but the service and food just failed so miserably. I almost tried to convince myself that maybe they had an off day, but it was seriously a Saturday night during prime dinner time and there's really no excuse for this bad of an experience. Will not be going back.

This review is for Page Family Practice, not Dr. Curtis Page himself.   I would like to point out that when you book your appointment online, you likely will not be booking with the doctor your requested, but one of the 8 that work between the 2 locations.   Please avoid this office at all costs. Although Dr. Foust was extremely knowledgable and I felt he could really help me, the process for the follow up appointment has not been worth it at all. I am currently on-hold, and have been for 20 minutes. This happens every time I call, with no other way to contact them besides physically going there. My pharmacy couldn't get a hold of them for simple prescription refill requests.   To sum up my experience, I went and got a full blood test done over 3 weeks ago. I was told 7-10 business days to get results back, and it has been well over that. I called many times over the course of 3 weeks (waiting 20 mins each time)  to see if my results were in, but they said they would call the lab and then call me back (which never happened). They also didn't tell me when my results were in, or to call me before my appointment to tell me that their electronic faxes weren't working. So they had my results back but their equipment wouldn't let them view it. When I did finally go in, they had no records of my first visit, so I had to repeat everything I had previously discussed with the doctor. They wanted to take a blood sample again, but failed to do so after trying 4 times.  If you need to go for a physical or something that is not an important issue, this place may work for you. Otherwise I highly suggest going anywhere else.

This venue is way too small for the amount of people they try to cram into every show. People come here to dance! They book good DJs, but it's not worth going when I know I'll get shoved and stepped on the entire time with no room to stand, sit or even dance. If I wanted to have an overcrowded mediocre "club" experience, oh I could take my pick at way too many other clubs and bars. This would be my last choice.  They always randomly block off huge areas for "VIP" which are completely empty! They don't open them up later, either. If you go to a show that's 18+ they literally have two fences down the middle of the tiny dance floor to separate the bar area from underage area. Even if the show you are going to says 21+, if they don't sell enough tickets, they open it up to 18+.   The sound is horrible. All I hear is bass. I usually spend half the time I'm there covering my ears, and I love going to shows.   Last time I was there, the fire alarm went off, and they just covered up the light and ignored it until it stopped. It's honestly scary knowing that if something happened there'd be a crazy stampede of people trying to get out of this small, overcrowded venue.

Their beers are amazing. Seriously. I don't know how more people don't know about it, but I'm sure they will once Mesa continues the light rail track. We went on a night when they had a live blues rock band. Great service, great selection. Crowd is a little odd, but beers make up for it.

Extremely unprofessional. In the waiting room I heard the secretary have to reschedule several appointments because "the system doesn't update properly and they're looking into it." They can't copy Xrays so the entire reason we went there is useless. Had to get another xray at the oral surgeon, and they still billed us for the Xray that we couldn't use.

Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Pretty cool vibe. Was not busy and our food came out almost immediately. I ordered the Farmer Omelette and asked for peppers instead of squash.  What was weird though, was that the omelette didn't taste like anything at all - super bland. Both the omelette AND the roasted potatoes were completely covered in onions. There is no mention of onions on the menu or else I would have ordered something different... Usually I can just take something off but this wasn't the case for this meal unfortunately. I get brunch every weekend and have never been anywhere where the potatoes are covered in onions so not sure why that's a thing here.  My boyfriend ordered the Gringo Burrito and he said it was also super bland.  We didn't order drinks because they were pretty pricey.

This place is awesome. Staff is very friendly and will talk to you about the brewing process and the industry. Music is always great. Perfect place to hang out an have a beer or two with friends. The area is small but I've never been when it's too busy. The only bummer is that they don't serve food, but they do have food trucks that stop by often. Delicious variety of beers! Oh, and they sell their glasses. I'm such a nerd.

This place is a new go-to spot for me. Great craft cocktail selection and happy hour prices. They have reverse happy hour as well with food and drink discounts. Bartender was very friendly and drinks didn't disappoint. I also really liked the ambiance here. I'm excited to go back and try their food.
