I love the ambiance and atmosphere of this place! The food was excellent. The only slight downfall is the limited menu options. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and will revisit!

One of my favorite places!!! Sometimes the service is lacking a bit (depending on who serves you) but the food and atmosphere make up for it. I've been to most of the Pita Jungle locations and love them all. Total A+. Only problem is now my standard for fresh, healthy food while dining out is making it hard to enjoy other restaurants!

Had a damaged/cracked iphone called and asked turn around time, was told by Jennifer definitely done in a day. Dropped it off at 8am, confirmed turn around time and was told yeah it'll be done by 5pm no problem. Show up and was told it wasn't finished, 20 more mins or less. Jennifer said should only take two hours tops for an iphone fix. 35 mins later it's fixed. I get $9.49 off the bill. Time is valuable. Won't come back.

Love Starbucks. Obviously. Dakota is super sweet and I love when she serves me. My only irk about this location is they don't carry their fat free cream cheese! :(

The 1 star is for the breadsticks. The food is frozen, may as well get a box from the frozen food section at Walmart. The service is awful.  I ordered the Garlic Rosemary Chicken, they were out of mashed potatoes which the waitress didn't inform us until the food was already brought out and substituted with chunk potatoes. Then she proceeded to ask me what I wanted to do if I wanted to reorder something else. As we were finishing up the meal she comes over with a cup of mashed potatoes and says well you can have these now and rudely reminded me that it wasn't her fault. I guess she thought it was mine. The manager came over and proceeded to tell us that she was waiting for the truck to bring the potatoes..... I think that about sums up the quality of the food. Even the chunk potatoes and chicken was subpar at best. Will never dine there again.

I had previously marked a great rating for this store, but that was only for Coach Katie who is no longer with the company. The place has fallen apart. Its a revolving door with teachers and scheduling is a nightmare. My son was there for 2 years and I feel he was nowhere near where he should be. I taught him in an above pool within a week. Waste of money.

I love their fish and chips and they have good cocktails. They are pretty busy on the weekends so I would recommend calling ahead and putting your name on the list. Katie is a really nice waitress!
