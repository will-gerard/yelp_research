Excellent accidental find.  We happen to be at a conference next door and when we got out we figured what the heck and we were hungry. What a pleasant find. From the moment we walked through the door we felt as if we had gone back in time to the old diner days when we got real homemade cooking. I have a real weakness for Chicken fried steak and this was some of the best I have had with fresh mashed potatoes and gravy. Came with corn and I ordered some corn bread to to top it off.  Corn bread was ok but processed.  Everything was fresh and delicious. So I had a quick thought that an old time diner might have a good milkshake. So I ordered and she said it would take about 10 minutes to prepare. It was fresh and delicious like we used to get. Everyone at the table took a taste and loved it.  Everyone was great done to the table buser. He was fun and attentive. I wanted to call our server 'Flo or Madge' and unfortunately forgot her name. On the way out I looked back into the kitchen and there was one cook working there so was surprised the service was so fast. I could not resist so waited until he looked out and gave him a thumbs up!   If you find yourself in the Thomas and 24th at area and want a good, fresh old time meal give this place a try. Skip the drive through and sit down for a real meal. We loved it and will be back.

I have eaten here many times and always find the food fresh and tasty. The bread couldn't be fresher right out of the oven. I really like the serving sizes that always fill me up.

Don't waste your time. they have the worst call-in customer service I ever experienced. First I experienced a non-functional web booking site. I received no email confirmation. So I had to call in and it took me Sooooooo many prompts to get through to someone that could help. Finally reach them and they found not 1 but 3 reservations! And they were ALL cancelled. Why would a company of this size with what should be unlimited resources to spend on a functional website have such and inadequate system and then provide very substandard call in service.

Great place for happy hour and beyond! Middle age mid to upper income group. Tried the signature Blue Martini and it was great. Food was good especially the warm brie. I would add more items to the menu. Live music was some of the best I have experienced. Closed it down and we will be back.

Service was very slow. Waitress was very pushy trying to pickup our food while we were still eating! Food was very basic and no signature dish to bring me back. I see others rating this much higher so I may take another look, but with do many good restaurants out there I am not in a hurry.

What a nice surprise. Were heading to a presentation at the Comerica and found this place on Yelp of course. It was highly rated but I was skeptical as I walked up realizing it was a hotel. All prejudgments were totally unsubstantiated.   The ambiance was very pleasant even though a little crowded. Service was impeccable and fast. I went with my Son and wife. I had the Poutine (Canadian Comfort Food) with braised pork. It was fabulous. Portion was huge and served hot. The braised pork was amazing. My Son had the Seared Scallops. How do you define perfect...I do a pretty good seared scallop but this was a whole new dimension in reality of how a scallop should be cooked. It was so soft and tasty the one that was offered to me by my son soon became 2! My wife had a nice pizza with veggies. She saw someone else get it and was enamored with the presentation and was not disappointed in taste. It was like we did a rotation of foods. My wife was sharing my Poutine and I was sharing my sons scallops and he was sharing my wife's pizza. Each one of us had nothing but good comments of each others dish.   I can highly and without reserve recommend this as a great place to eat when downtown.
