Hire more Europeans because your snotty customer service sucks. I bought a backpack there a while back (it was turquoise green), and it used to hang on a manequin in the store. I wanted to feel the quality of this leather before committing to a few thousands and  the lady yelled at me not to touch it. The person I was shopping with spends 12 K on average at that store so yelled at them and asked her to wrap it up and get another sales person for me but I always avoid that place and saw that it's very different from the stores I go to in Europe (where I have a tea made and a comfy chair and a friendly smile and helpful attitudes right away). Please learn from your creators and hire friendly, more appropriate staff not power tripping witches. How sad Guccio Gucci would turn in his grave right now and the backpack was re gifted because it reminded me of that mean gold digging woman too much;))

Being a makeup artist and an image consultant from Europe I'm rarely impressed with mediocre service many cosmetic stores provide because of ridiculous expectations a lot of stores force on the employees in the U.S. (sky high sales goals or unpacking the merchandise while cleaning or doing the loss prevention or long work shifts/ you name it most places are terrible at customer service it's not Switzerland) however the Ulta near where we live is impressive. First of all: I have always been treated with most sincere respect and gratitude in this Scottsdale store. I am really particular about the brushes and the product but most of The service more grown up and extremely helpful sales associates provide is admirable. My visit was brief and I'm so glad they had my perfume and opened the box and showed me what the new bottles look like (cos bar in Scottsdale would never do anything normal and I don't always want to drive for 30 min each way to Neiman Marcus, sephora is bad because they forget that some people do pretty magical things or are stewards of the environment at the same time and do well on their own unless they ask questions). The godsends at ulta get it: my cashier was Sherri and she did a marvelous job!!:)) thanks ulta grow happy and create amazing talents and great connections with customers:))

Horrible check out. Overcharged me 30 dollars on a 7 item transaction and wasted my whole lunch break 45 min on trying to figure out their own mistakes when I went over the receipt with a manager and 2 employees who were both incapable of simple register functions. Shop elsewhere and don't get taken advantage of. I wonder how many people don't notice such mistakes daily. So sad.

The worst customer service I have ever experienced in my whole life. I bought a product that didn't work properly. I came to let the manager know so other people don't have the same issue since it may cost a lot to correct after this. I asked to return or exchange since I had the receipt, it was only 24 hours since I got the product. I brought it all back even the containers it was in. The manager told me with a smile she won't refund and I can call the manufacturer. Good job Miss Olivia, maybe you hate your job or helping people,  but I came to find a sloution not be laughed at. I called the manufacturer named developlus in Corona CA. I was on hold for 45 minutes.They told me after answering a few questions that I should bring the box and the receipt back to Walmart and I should be credited back. Sounds great but just to avoid standing in line one more time I called Walmart again to tell them about the outcome of my conversation with the manufacturer and when may I come by to resolve my issue. Miss Amy placed me on hold. She told me that she went to Miss Olivia and told me there is nothing she can do but call the manufacturer again and when I asked why are they being so difficult she stated " Olivia said CALL THE MANUFACTURER"  Go Team Work;)).  I'm sorry but I have to start shopping in target and bless myself with people and products who are worthy of my gorgeous life and money I earn. God bless intelligent employees who should apply at better companies. I suggest target and albertsons (always get a smile and thank you there:).

One of the best of the West. My husband and I had a wedding dinner party in The Rock on 12/12/12. I'm from Europe so going to the unique and traditional places makes me nostalgic because of the scent of the freshly baked pie and local feel with old country decor!!:)) My honey loves the pie so we couldn't think of a better place at reasonable price and in between Scottsdale and Flagstaff. All our family &friends are an international bunch: American, Mexican, Polish, German, Brazilian, Israeli, Chinese. Everyone found something good on the menu to their preference and diet restrictions as its well put together. Nothing more to add just a huge thank you and God bless you really good rock springs az folks!!:)) We will always stop by to grab a pie or a meal when I'm on highway I 17 and you're open

After a terrible customer experience at Walmart (goodness you wouldn't believe it!!)) I decided to stop by Target today and get the rest of the things I wanted and see if I can switch our family and friends to this store. Anyways TARGET is so much better!!:)) It has less choices and maybe a bit more expensive but hey: it shows in how nicely I have been treated and how impressed I was with how everything was in place and faced the right way. The aisles were clean and nothing was blocking my path, I found things easily and at the very end at the checkout the sweetest little blonde lady took my things and carried it over to save me time scanned my shopping at the customer service desk. Bravo!!:)) 5 stars baby it's our new favorite store from now on!!:))

I came by this morning to pick up a few things. The prices were the only difference I felt at this "experience the difference" store. The small dish soap detergent for my sink is $9!!:)) It's .89c in a regular store and about $4 at the Whole Foods for larger container and adequate brand so we see who has the most crazy mark ups!!:)) You can imagine how awesome I felt driving elsewhere to find ALL i want. No options for an economically responsible shopper yet crowded with tacky plastic decor. Beware of the price traps my friends.

To us it was a perfect place and the rooms were clean (my parents stayed next door and liked it also). My bed was comfy and the employees helpful. You can't beat the value for the price and I would recommend this place to people who understand that it's a family run little motel and want to support local business owners. Thank you again!!:))

Absolutely fantastic. I love Asian food and it was a buffet treat to everyone (even people who aren't crazy about sushi and are choosy). The selection of fresh cut meats, fish, chicken, dumplings, veggie rolls, desserts, fruit: took my breath away:)) I felt like I'm in a food heaven!!:)) even the green tea they made me is the kind I like best: Rich, powdery green hot tea I love!!:)) The service was perfect too: when the sweet lady saw I'm eating crab legs she got me the tiny fork and all the necessary utensils right away, and was super friendly and personal, not your average "I'm doing you a huge favor" face!!:) oh and we got a coupon buy one dinner get second half price and they accepted and we are so happy we have a new favorite place to eat at nearby:)) the interiors are very much like all American seafood or steak house but food is really ahead of the game: soups were so good too. Love you guys/ keep up this kind of quality dining:))

Went there twice so far. Amazing presentation and such a wonderful place. Our friend got a bit tipsy since it was her bday and was getting a bit "fresh" towards  the waitress but the server took it like a pro and was really kind and attentive regardless. Excellent food and a great staff. The manager brought us a gorgeous dessert and we had a blast:))

Awful. Just to start: our friend had a party inside and wasn't answering her phone because it's super loud so we weren't quite sure what the name on the list was because her friends booked it for her and people wwere drinking at the time. We were told to stand in an hour long line at 12 am so at 1 am we were finally getting allowed in. They forgot to tell us the cover was 30 dollars (we had 8 friends with us) AFTER we made it to the front (and only 1 hour left/ hello). That was unexpected and rude (I expected to pay $10 at the most because I was paying for all my friends and had a fancy bday gift for the girl inside and just wanted to stop by for a drink give her a gift and leave). Asked to speak with the manager to address my issue and he was telling me that I should have known the entrance fee was $30 (per hour wtf;)) because i see the registers in front (what an a**hole/ price was not posted anywhere I'm not a fortune teller!!), so we ended up going elsewhere where the entrance was free we had tons of fun and asked our friends to come meet us outside of that crappy snobbish club with equally bad management with a smirk;/ sorry but I will be sure to go better places!!:)) xoxoxoo

We came in kind of late (8:20 pm) yet they were graceful to find us a perfect table and make it super romantic and pretty. We ordered the specials (mine was delicious shrimp with sun dried tomatoes and poetic& tasty spaghetti made al dente just like 5 stars restaurants in Europe). My husband had chicken with delicious arrabiata sauce and egg plant graced by rigatoni pasta:)). We were impressed and are huge plates of food even though we both are thin people. We were blessed to order the tiramisu to go and enjoy it today. Amazing!!:)) I highly recommend this restaurant.

Horrible. They were not only loud and filthy but also out of the things I wanted to eat. They brought wrong food tony table and I touched the fries and saw them take it back to the service station. Told the waiter I already touched it but I was ignored and saw this go to another table in front of me. Scary gross and I was wondering why anyone ever goes there. I've been to a flagstaff location before when I was in college and they were a lot more sanitary and never took anything back after landing it in front of my face. Wow
