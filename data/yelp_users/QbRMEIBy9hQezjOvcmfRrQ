Bob was incredible to work with.  He and his crew are all very professional and did an excellent job.  They were kind, respectful and skilled.  We had them do a variety of things including artificial grass, custom BBQ, pavers, a ramada, electrical and a custom hot tub.  They worked around our schedule and had to deal with bad weather (yes, we had bad weather in PHX!).  My family always looked forward to seeing Bob and the guys, great people.  I can not recommend this company enough, they will be doing all of my landscaping projects as long as I live w/in their radius!

Great place, great owner, great staff. I often take my kids to this location before/after Suns games. My kids are 3 and 5, they love coach's corner. The staff is always very friendly to them, bring them crayons and make sure the kids are having fun.  The beer selection is good and they have good food. Their wings are great and I love their salads.  I highly recommend this place for drinks with your friends or a parent-child outing. Give them a shot, they may give you one back : )   They don't get a lot of foot traffic and it would be sad if they didn't make it.  Go SUNS!!

I miss Happy Harry's! This place is now more like a car sales lot then a friendly car wash. They try to up sell everything, very annoying. Aside from that, the quality is horrible. I paid for a detailed exterior and interior wash, when they were done there was still dirt in the cracks of the seats and they didn't vacuum under my sunglasses case.  They were so lazy they just sprayed the case, never lifted it up or moved it. I'd expect that for $5 but not for $30. Won't be going back, which is sad because I used to go to Harry's all the time. Sigh.
