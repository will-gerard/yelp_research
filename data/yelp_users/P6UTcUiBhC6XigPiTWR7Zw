So disappointed in the change of menu. Being able to customize your protein with the different styles offered or different combinations of sauces with veg and starch of choice was the best part of this restaurant and something I looked forward to each time. They're accommodating and can still do a lot of their original menu preparations, but it's just not the same. May have lost some loyal patrons. Please change your menu back!

Wow this place is something special. I was so looking forward to going back after a great experience last summer albeit a bit hesitant to go during restaurant week. Had very high expectations to fill last night and Crudo did not disappoint. I started with the Arcadia Club to drink, loved the egg white foam to top it off. My mom and I shared the pig ears to start; a little too on the vinegar-y side for my taste but can you beat anything that's been fried? For my three courses I went with the Albacore Crudo, Brisket and an olive oil cake for dessert. Oh and had to add the Burrata! The truffle oil and the black garlic on the crudo were divine! So so satisfying. The brisket was the perfect blend of crispy and just the slightest bit of fat for flavor and moisture. Quality is just top notch, everything was so delicious and the perfect portions to get a taste of everything. Only minor complaint would be the pace of the courses, everything came out so quickly as if it had been sitting there ready and waiting for some time. The staff is very attentive; always refilling water and bringing fresh silverware for each course. Thank you for another amazing meal! Can't wait to go back

Was really looking forward to having a new neighborhood go-to but overall left underwhelmed. There is so much potential in this place which the restaurant does not (yet) live up to. I recently dined with my family; we started off with drinks, two orders of guac and an order of street tacos. Not sure if there was any EtOH in my margarita and the pour of my mom's wine glass was rather insulting; they did accommodate and pour her a bigger glass when asked. The food is okay, nothing to write home about. I had the chicken mole which had a strong peanut butter flavor I wasn't expecting; the rice and beans to accompany your entree are rather bland. Mejico, you're over-priced for the food and for the neighborhood. $22 for a relleno with no more than a few shrimp, beans and rice? Knock a few dollars off your entrees and you'll draw a bigger crowd.
