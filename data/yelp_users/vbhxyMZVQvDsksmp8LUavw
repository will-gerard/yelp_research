The dining room has a really charming d√©cor with a cozy and romantic ambiance. We popped in on a whim for a late dinner about 8ish on a Saturday back in December. Surprisingly they were not busy so we were seated immediately. I'd recommend this place for a special occasion dinner when you have time to enjoy a meal at a leisurely pace. We were brought fresh slices of bread and the olive oil was already on the table but strangely we didn't have any balsamic vinegar. I ordered the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola which is a Japanese sweet potato pasta in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. The ravioli was delicious and the to-die-for sauce rich & creamy!

I recently finished using my 30 day unlimited pass. The Tempe location is the last of the 3 Bikram locations I've tried since January.  You do get the most bang for your buck by sticking with one location and taking advantage of the 20% off a class package.  It really is a state-of-the-art studio. The the studio itself has none of the sweaty "smell" mentioned in the other reviews. The anti-microbial "carpet" is my favorite flooring of all the Bikram locations I've been to. The corner farthest from the lobby door really IS the HOT side of the room but there are several fans so you can set your mat up near one to catch a hot breeze. Check out their website for lots of useful info about yoga etiquette & how to be ready for your first Bikram class. The shower/sink area is TINY for the number of people using the dressing room.   This location is celebrating their 10 year anniversary & is always BUSY!! Each class typically 40+ students in it & I think they MAX out around 50. Yes 50!! So the size of the class itself can be a bit intimidating if you're new to Bikram. The routine seems to be get there as early as you can, go lay out your mat in the spot of your choice & then sit in the lobby until 2 min before class.  I've tried to change it up & try class with at least 10 different teachers. While the dialogue is basically the same, each one has their own energy & style. You can check the schedule online if you want to choose your class specific to the instructor. And several of the instructors actually do teach at more than one location. I really enjoyed classes with Charles, Ben & Jeremy.  All of them reminded us about the importance of BREATHING! My favorites phrase from Charles is so simple: " I am inhaling. I am exhaling." It really helped me focus on controlling my breathing :)   One instructor actually finished about 8 minutes early and I did feel rushed! I was hoping it was just a fluke but the 2nd time I took her class the same thing happened.  There were 4 or 5 first-time Bikram students in the class and not once did she remind us about a 5 second in / 5 second out breath. Nor did she talk about how they might be feeling or say it was ok to take a knee or lie down if needed.  If she offered up a little more guidance we would probably finish at 90 minutes. I hate to say it but I probably won't be taking her class again.

This review is specifically about the Special Event ice skating rink that is set up around Thanksgiving & runs until just after the New Year. We went for the last Saturday night skating session of this season. Our group of 8 made this our first stop for a birthday/bachelorette party outing.  Once we got thru the logistics of getting our skates rented ($5) & paying for the skating ($15), we found a bench sat down & put on our skates. However, we were scolded for not lacing up in the right location. You MUST stay on the black walkway/bench area once you have your skates on. Would have been helpful to know that when we sat down & started the whole process. Perhaps directional arrows on the ground or sign or two saying "lace-up here" or a simple "DON'T put skates on here" would avoid this issue. Be sure to hit up the beverage stand BEFORE you put your skates on because you can't walk across the cement to get to it once you're laced up.  After we actually made it on the real ice we had a lot of fun. We only skated for about an hour or so but 2 hours would have been exhausting. ;)  I'd definitely go back so I could take a ride on the Princess Express train to see ALL of the holiday lagoon lights & displays. The train runs just thru the end of December not after the 1st of the year.

I was disappointed with the fish & chips last night. We've had it many times before and it's always been a go-to menu item for me. But last night the piece of fish was half it's usual size and they must have changed their fries. They were small schnibbles of fries & were on the greasy size. I'll go back but I'll try a different menu next time.

Checked out this place over the weekend since I bought the living social deal & it was about to expire! It was definitely worth the $25 we spent on the voucher. We had a flight of 3 cabernet wines & a flight of 3 chardonnay wines. We received a plate EACH of 2 cheeses with grapes, apples & nuts. Surprisingly we had a bit more cheese than we did of the fruit & nuts. Could have used a piece of bread on each plate to finish it off.  The bistro wasn't busy at all but the vibe felt a bit stuffy even though they did have baseball on the TV. The staff was just a couple of bartenders who seemed friendly & our server. The server was a tad odd & he mumbled when he spoke. All in all the food was just decent. We did only have the sweet potato fries & 2 teeny street tacos (2) for $5 on HH.  The prices were reasonable since we stuck to the Happy Hour menu. I think I have a couple of other wine places in the East Valley that would be my choice before I go back to D'Vine. I'd say 2.5 stars if there was a half to give.

I can't stop raving about The Parlor! A group of 6 of us met for dinner here on NYE & I'm thrilled that we did.  I was blown away by 3 AMAZING appetizers that we ordered: Arancini (crispy risotto ball), the Cauliflower Gratinata & Bruxelles (brussel sprouts w/ pancetta). The Zeppole and Carmel Pears & Apples which we had for dessert were just average in comparison with the other food. Next visit I probably won't save any room for dessert. You can find pictures of all 3 apps that have been posted by various reviewers!  This place used to be a beauty parlor but doesn't resemble a pizza "parlor" in looks at all. No checkered red & white table cloths here! We sat out on the covered patio with vine covered walls & candles. I think sometime it would be fun to sit inside & watch the pizza-stretchers and the pizza assembly. Looking forward to going back!

Should have trusted the 2-star yelp review & tried another place at Westgate. We went here to grab a bite before an event at Jobing.com arena. There was no wait & we sat down outside. We ordered beers which were $6 and $7 a pint. We asked about HH while I turned around & read the sign saying HH from 4-7sign. They took it down after explaining there weren't any specials. The fact that there was an "event" meant NO happy hour specials.... Zip, zero, none! Really you can't have even one beer on special? Lame.  Wing orders have to be ALL one flavor & you get 8. You can't get two "flavors". I guess that would be too complicated. A bit later we ordered a burger & a club sandwich. I kid you not, they came out in under 2 minutes! Obviously not made fresh for "our" order... Big disappointment. And even though the menu reads, "all burgers cooked to medium" it was well done.  Honestly the soft pretzel twist & the chocolate dessert stand inside the venue concession area looked better than what we ate at McFadden's. We won't be going back to this joint. If you don't have drink specials your food better be darn good...

Mahin was amazing! We had a girl's night-in last month to celebrate a milestone birthday.  It was part lesson & part performance. She started the evening out with a dance-floor style lesson to teach us some belly dance moves. We had a blast learning to shimmy & shake! She even brought a basket of hip scarves with dozens of silver & gold coins for us to wear. I can definitely see how it would be a great workout out! I can't wait to try out one of her Saturday afternoon class. Mahin then changed into a sparkling performance costume & put on a little show for our group. I think we all wanted our own pair of finger cymbals by the time she was done! We had a ton of fun & it made the evening an extremely memorable occasion.

Finally went to check this place out with a few friends on Saturday night. We arrived in time to catch the last hour of daily 4pm-8pm HH specials. The place has a cool inside/outside bar open to the patio. We grabbed a couple small tables out on the patio because it was actually more comfortable outside with the misters on. This proved to be a wise choice since the inside became a HOT box! Might need to dial down the AC a couple of degrees when it is 105 outside.   We were excited to see Four Peaks Peach Ale on the menu but had to settle for a Shock Top since they didn't have it available. They have great HH food & drink specials. The soft pretzels were amazing with cheese sprinkled on top & served with a scrumptious Guinness beer cheese! We will definitely go back during HH to try some of the other food. I'll certainly be keeping my eye on their live band schedule too!

Arrive early so you have time to explore the place & the food/drink menu. The entrance on the 2nd floor faces True Food & the splash pad. I ordered the soft pretzel starter which was pretty tasty. I wish the cheese sauce had been served warm.  Somehow I missed out on the bday perk even though I had joined their FREE loyalty membership several months ago. I think they give you a free birthday movie ticket which might be good for 2 weeks.  The premium seats were awesome. Definitely a nice splurge & you don't have to try to have dinner beforehand & then rush to make the movie.

We decided to try this place since a band we like was playing there. Nice selection of craft beers on draft. And the menu is a good mix of different options from burgers to wing & a prime rib special on the weekends.   The place wasn't very busy when we arrived around 7pm on a Saturday night. We were told we'd have 2 servers one of them being in training... Not sure what happened - service was fine thru dinner but the service took a nose-dive after dinner. The place wasn't particularly crowded but we still had to hunt down the server a couple of times for more drinks.   The bacon blue burger was good with a healthy serving of thick cut bacon. I would recommend the steak fries over the HOB fries.  The honey hot wings were good but didn't blow me away. We may go back sometime just to try out the prime rib special or the potato soup. I'd rate this at 2.5 stars if a half-star was available.

I am really ENJOYING yoga at this studio! I'm a bit hesitant to shell out $$ for a gym or yoga membership without getting to try it out first. So I was THRILLED when Floating Lotus offered a Groupon for 15 classes. I've been to 7 or 8 classes so far. Nikki has been the instructor for probably half of the classes I've taken. Her verbal cues are TOP-NOTCH! Her voice calmly keeps the focus on the mental & physical element of the practice as she guides you thru each pose. I've also taken a class or two with Jackie, Shella & Katie. Each instructor has their individual style & works to accommodate all levels. They have mats, blankets, blocks & straps to use as needed.
