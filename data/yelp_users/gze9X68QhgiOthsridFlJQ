We went there for our 12th anniversary. It wasn't what I expected. The service was slow. We noticed that seating  were segrated by groups/race (left right and middle). On one side, we saw all white customers and they seemed to get excellent services with constant fresh meats. They were on the first serve group. As for my fiance and I, we were the only asian couple there so we were seated at the middle table with empty tables around. The remained side was darker skins group. Services for us and darker skin groups were slow. They didnt stay for long compared to the white tables. As for us,  my fiance's stomach was still half empty when we left.

Its not that great. And pricing is above average compared to others. Food was just plain. Gotta love the fake reviews....
