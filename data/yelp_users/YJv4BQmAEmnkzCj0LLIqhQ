Came here because Cooperstown was closed. Got a seat quick, sat for 20 minutes and not 1 damn waitress, with 2 or 3 walking around, came to our table. We just got up and left. For a place supposedly owned by a former Phoenix Sun, it lacks to impress... would rate it no stars if I could.

Okay, first off...when you look up Chinese delivery, this is the first one the pops up. Err, wrong. We called for delivery, they don't deliver.   Placing the order over the phone was easy, in fact they even have a menu on-line. That is where the good stuff ends....   I ordered the beef with broccoli and 2 egg rolls. The egg rolls were a little small, chewy, and not much flavor, (not much good flavor anyway). And the beef with broccoli was bland as well. The broccoli itself was good, if you take away the sauce that's on it.   My wife always said that this place was a little pricey, but we were really craving Chinese. I think she liked hers, she got the almond chicken. She too didn't like the egg rolls.   The one good thing about this place...it's right next door to LJ's pizza, they have some decent pizza, and an all you can eat pizza buffet on Saturdays! Should have wanted pizza...

Tony is the man! And his crew...just as great! Friday night, called at 830 and asked if it was too late to order a large white with wings. His answer? Never too late! Even if the food was bad, which we all KNOW it isn't, the customer service and personal service make it even better! Unfortunately...You can only give 5 STARS on this app.   Thank you Casanova Brothers!

The customer service here SUCKS! They've messed up orders. I've gone back in to get the things they've missed, and they look at you like what do you want me to do. In the drive thru, they don't ask what you want with your order, they just toss you your order and close the window. This used to be one of the best locations.

Been here before several times. Did it's usual ok. Came tonight, (don't come for dinner). It's like the whole state of Minnesota is here. The food didn't taste that great this time either. Sushi rice was dry. Tea tasted like water. Not happy.

After reading a few reviews on the place I had to try it. I've passed by it for years never paying much attention to it.   I must agree with past reviewers...the food is good. But, sometimes it's not always just about the food. The service was outstanding. I was greeted at the door with a smile, and when I met my party at the table, the server was right on top of serving water and asking what we would like, if anything else to drink.   I felt like a giant to our server, and the gentleman was extremely kind, courteous and helpful in explaining the different dishes presented at the buffet. The food was flavorful!   I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good Indian food.

By far the BEST DETROIT EXPERIENCE in the Phoenix area! Been living in Mesa for 28 years, best coney out here! Let's not forget the Faygo orange soda! And the fries are fresh cut too. Love everything about this place. You gotta put one in Mesa near Val Vista and Baseline, but I'll drive out here till there's one closer!

Our server, Brittany, is amazing! She always came over to check on us. If you have the chance to sit in her area, do it.   The food, what you'd expect at a bar, but with flavor! The wings were actually cooked to perfection, rare in bars. We were all very happy with the service and the food/drinks. Looking forward to coming back again soon!
