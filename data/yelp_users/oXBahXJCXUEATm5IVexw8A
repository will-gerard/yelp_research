Enjoyed a little local culture yesterday with a friend of mine.    Sometimes I forget that we actually have some great history here in the Southwest.  It was awesome just soaking it all in!   Tons of amazing dolls and hand-crafted jewelry caught my eye first.  Lots of beautifully executed baskets and clothing on display, among clay pots with intricate carvings and/or painting.    Presently, there is a Georgia O'Keefe exhibit featuring some of her lesser known works with a more Southwestern flare.  It was refreshing to see something other than the flowers she's so popularly known for.  They have a 12 minute video about her, too which gave some insight into her almost 100 year life.   I highly recommend going to the Heard Museum to get your culture fix.

I have to say, for us ladies who love ladies, there aren't many options for bars.  That being said, I think the Cash is pretty swell.  They aren't trying to be something they're not (ZGirl club, take notes!), they're not pretentious and there's never a wait/cover to get in.  The bartenders are chill and remember you even if it's been a long time.  I love Kat and the other bartender (name unknown to me) with the lovely silver hair who always asks "what'll it be, babe?".  The music isn't exactly my style, but they do throw a few booty-shakers in amongst the country ballads.  I love watching the dance floor, as most of the ladies/gents/others know how to cut a rug.  They have a large outdoor patio for the folks who enjoy smoke and the drinks are cheap:)  Love what you do, don't change a thing!

It doesn't always have to be fancy schmancy to satisfy my hunger.  I much prefer Sweet Tomatoes to other salad bar joints because their ingredients are fast superior. They have several types of greens and the toppings can include fresh beets, butternut squash, garbanzo beans, and more! They always have multiple soups with at least one vegetarian option and different pastas, pizzas and muffins.  I also like their themes (strawberry, lemon, orange, etc.)...keeps things interesting. They have sodas, flavored teas, juices, milk and water and a soft serve machine with various toppings for dessert. Bring your student i.d. for a little discount, too!

As a culinary industry employee/baked goods enthusiast, I have to say that I really dig this little gem.  They have everything you could need for baking that perfect cake, cookie, candy, chocolate, etc.  They have decorations, edible glitters, sprinkles, cake toppers, utensils, cake sheets, food coloring, helpful staff, classes and more!  I love coming in here and just walking around to try and get ideas.  They can be a tad pricey but it's worth checking out.  I even found rose water here when I was making a chocolate cake and wanted to make a vanilla bean/rose frosting!! Yay cakes!

I recently decided to take up running.  Crazy, I know.    I really wanted to get legitimate with it, and this place had been recommended a few times.  So, down I went to see what it was all about.    I was promptly greeted by Kelly.  She asked what I was in for and I told her I had no idea what I needed, as far as shoes go.  She was up for the challenge.  I have to say, this was the most interactive shoe buying experience I've ever had. First, she had my take off my shoes and show her how I walked.  After observing my feet she went to the back and brought out several pairs of shoes.  She showed me how to properly put the shoe on and then had me go for a little jog outside of the store while she observed some more.  I ended up doing this a couple of times, each with more comfortable shoes.  I ended up with a really great pair from Brooks that I nearly fell asleep in the first night like a little kid.  I didn't feel like she was trying to push me to buy higher priced shoes, which is great! I hate feeling pressured to get the biggest/most expensive/etc. of something.  Then she gave me a little info on what kind of socks I should be wearing.  I referred a friend here, who also found her experience to be top notch.  I look forward to shopping here again! I can't sing Kelly's praises enough, she was so awesome!

I really dig this place.  They have a lot to offer for such a small wittle store.  I am definitely in love with the low prices on flowers and plants, as I like to give my lady love pretty things from time to time.  The food is quite swell, with their vast selection of fresh and frozen goods, produce, meats, cheeses, wine (they have local wines!!), personal hygiene items, snacks, desserts, and so on.  The staff is always always ALWAYS very friendly and helpful, and just have a general sense of rad...like they enjoy their job.  I feel this review is short, but ain't it sweet?  Keep up the greatness guys!

Came here to buy the lady something sparkly for her finger and was greeted promptly.  The folks behind the counter were super helpful when I needed them, but weren't too up in my grill.  They have some nice stuff that won't cost you a fortune.  Two thumbs up!

I love this place!!  I was on the hunt for the perfect ring for my woman.  I walked in and was greeted promptly, but it wasn't an immediate "Here buy our jewels" kind of deal.  The folks behind the counter let me come to them and weren't pushy, thank God cause I probably would have left.  They have really beautiful stuff here, some new and some estate.  I found "the ring" several months ago, but didn't make the purchase until after I had a few visits with it.  I wanted to make sure it was right.  They remembered who I was when I first came back, and that means a lot to me. When I made my final payment earlier this week, the lady was almost as excited as me!  I love supporting the local folk, and I hope that if and when you want some new bling you'll give this place a shot!

I have loved this place for a long time.  It troubles me that people write such negative things in their reviews.  Hi, it costs money to have a credit card machine and if you don't spend over five bucks it costs the COMPANY money. Duh.   And in regards to closing early, yes, it is a bummer.  However, it would be a far greater bummer if they had to close down instead.  In an economy where businesses are disappearing left and right, they are still here.  That says a lot.  The coffee is delicious, latte art very cool and the new baked goods made in-house are absolutely to die for.  Keep up the great work guys!

It's true...I have experienced better, much better.  I really want to like this place, but both times I've eaten here I have been unimpressed.  I ordered a veggie burrito with a side of fruit and some salsa.  Ugh, first off, the avocado that came with the dish was old, not old like it could have been made into some tasty guac...it was dark and tasted like it should have gone into a compost bin rather than my mouth.  Second, the fruit looked as though it had been cut (or taken out of it's package) many days prior to hitting my plate, so I didn't even bother eating it.  Lastly, the freaking salsa looked so pale and gross that I just gave up on the meal entirely.  I was really disappointed with their obvious lack of care when it came to the quality of food they were sending out.  In no way would I have ever sent any of that food out had it been my restaurant.  The server was nice enough and the coffee mug was huge, but I won't be back, sorry kids...I gave you a second try and you came up short again.

So, I usually come here with my girlfriend, as she has the green thumb.  It's a very tranquil place to come and walk around, they have a large selection of trees (large and small), small plants, pots, flowers, food plants, gardening equipment, seeds, etc. The staff has always been super helpful and they also have gift certificates available.

I stopped by for some non-plastic wear (cups and bowls) and was delighted to see their fun juice/coffee bar.  They have a nice selection of different fresh juices, coffees and they even have kombucha on tap!  I don't remember the name of the juice I got, but it had kale, parsley, celery, cucumber, apple and spinach and was soooo good!  Overall, I really appreciate the fact that they support local business and stock their shelves with products that have some freaking integrity.  If it weren't so far from where I lived, I'd probably shop here more often.  Keep it real, guys:)

I can't help myself, I just enjoy coming in here to see what funny/nostalgic things they have to offer.  I don't usually find anything for myself here these days...as I am a bit older now, but they do have some great shirts (bands and funny ones), a wide variety of make up and body jewelery, and some cute shoes.

A friend of mine recently got hitched and she asked me to be her bridesmaid, woo!  She stayed the night at this hotel and I came bright and early the next day for hair/makeup and mimosas:)  This place is quite snazzy, with its chic decor and great complimentary breakfast.  The breakfast wasn't your typical bowl of overripe apples and a box of frosted flakes, no no, they had a waffle iron, eggs, bagels, oatmeal, juices, milk, coffee, English muffins, yogurt, etc.  Quite impressive.  The room was nice, my friend said she thought the bed was a little firm for her liking, but otherwise nice.  The only downside was that during our wedding makeovers, the water stopped working.  As in, no toilet flushing or washing of hands.  When you have seven women in one room with flowing champagne, that's not a good thing.  The front desk was more than helpful, however, and opened up several rooms next to us and a few downstairs, too.  Thanks for the hospitality!

I have visited Halo several times for piercing needs since I turned 18, and I have to say they are great!  The staff is super helpful and informed, the space is CLEAN!! and they have a huge selection of jewelry to pick from.  I have been thinking about getting my nose pierced again, so I stopped in a few days ago. Not only did they answer every single question I had (and believe me, there were plenty), but they also showed me a lot of different jewelry options and helped me figure out what I wanted to do.  I highly recommend you stop in if you are in the mood for some body modification.  (P.S. they also have regular jewelry like necklaces, rings, and bracelets, too!)

Dear Shannel, how I love your styling techniques and professionalism.  Your informative ways and nice scalp massage really were swell:)    First time here, definitely not the last!  The decor is chic, the staff is friendly and they even offer lattes! I was asked to fill out a little question and answer before getting my 'do did, and I was delighted to find that my stylist went through it and talked with me about my answers.  My hair going in was a hot mess and coming out, *insert Ron Burgundy voice* "EVERYONE, COME SEE HOW GOOD I LOOK!"    I highly recommend this salon if you're looking to take your frumpy, lifeless locks to the next level.

This place is adorable!  Very pink:)  When you walk in it's like a time travel back in to the 50's.  They have a large selection of ice cream flavors, some sugar free, one sorbet, and a few sherbets.  They have a full menu of different house specialties, sundaes, shakes/malts, ice cream flights (available in 3,4, or 5), and so on.  Seems like it would be a great place for a birthday party.  They also make ice cream cakes (need to be ordered ahead of time)! We will continue to come back!

I really, really love this place.  I have been eating and drinking it up here for years!  No matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me and that is a huge plus.  The food is always tasty, and the margaritas flow without end.  I used to eat the Baja Chicken Burrito or something with carne asada.  Now, I am pleased to say that I am able to easily munch on tasty food sans meat/cheese.  They have vegetarian burritos, a spinach/cream sauce enchilada dish, and more for the veg heads.    The chips and salsa is effing delicious!  I can't tell you how many times I have had really mediocre salsa at other Mexican food restaurants.  Not here!! It's fresh and they never let our chip bowl or salsa go empty.  The food is great, the prices are super and the customer service is unbeatable!  There's no reason not to eat here:)  Gracias, dudes!

Yes!! Just grabbed some din din here tonight.  Thai iced tea was like a creamy milkshake, the soup (coconut milk, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, mushrooms, and extra veggies instead of chicken) is my fave! (#18 I think).  The service can be a little slow at times, but it really doesn't change how I feel about them.  Everyone is always nice and friendly and I have never had bad or so-so food here.  Get it!

We ate here a while ago and somehow I forgot to review!  The little lady told me about this place and said she enjoyed her breakfast.  So, we decided upon Eye Opener for a spot of brunch one day.  Bad, bad, bad choice.  First off, our "server" clearly didn't know what she was doing, which is something I can totally overlook cause I was once a newbie, too.  However, she got the order wrong (the little lady ordered ham and eggs which comes with toast and hashbrowns and all the server brought was a side of eggs and then didn't come back to check on us and I had to go up to the counter to see what was up...), she NEVER came back to refill my coffee or either of our waters (to the point where we both set our cups to the very edge of the table so that she could see them, but that didn't help either), and to top it off she totally kept telling us that she was new and tried to justify her lack of attention to everything.  Look chick, it's one thing if you're new, but don't try to make it better by claiming that you just started each time you forget stuff.  I will totally understand and be more willing to accept your shortcomings if you just try to rectify the situation to the best of your abilities.  When we finally were able to get our bill, we went up to the counter where, I'm assuming it was the owner, was working the register.  She asked how everything was and we told her about our less than lovely experience.  This is where it gets great!  She totally made the same excuses about the server being new (dude! I don't care!!) and she gave us a "discount" of ONE DOLLAR, which we didn't even want.  I'd like to say that I would give this place a second chance, but the food wasn't even good.  Next!

As I finish up my last months of externship, I find myself wondering....why?  Why didn't I shop around a little more?  Don't get me wrong, I do feel as though I learned a great deal here, but the price is quite high and there's a lot going on these days that just rub me the wrong way.  Exhibit A: we used to have a library with real books...now we have an empty room.  We have a cyber library.  Well...what I am to do when this online library real-life crashes and I needs to get my read on?  Exhibit B: we used to have a fairly extensive financial aid department, but they are gone now, just like the books.  Now I get to deal with some Joe shmoe on the net from who knows where.  Exhibit C: no more student services peeps.  Ok, really?  These are probably three of the more important things students need guys!  Also, if you want to be in class with people who are serious about their culinary careers, you might want to look elsewhere...cause there are a lot of kids who have mama and daddy paying for them to dick around...I get it, maybe in the first few classes, but even at the end of school, people are allowed to barely skate by with D's.  I want to be in a learning environment with people who care, too.  Maybe I'm asking too much...but maybe I'm not.  There are some really great chef's here, but the politics and the way the school is run just makes for a lackluster experience.

So, we were looking for something new to try and this place popped up on my OpenTable app.  It was also my birthday, so I thought it'd be nice to enjoy some Italian food on the day this Italian was born.  We were promptly greeted and taken to our table next to all the wine:)  They brought out some bread, which had herbs and spices on top and came with some kind of red pepper dip.  I wasn't too keen on the dip, but my man was.   For beverages, he had a Kiltlifter and I had a glass of Sean Miner cab (it's my last trimester and I hear it's ok...plus I nursed that sucker throughout the ENTIRE meal!).  For apps, we each had a salad: he had a Caesar which came with the addition of toasted cashews (Yum!) and I had a Greek salad.  We were both quite pleased with both the flavors and portion.  For entrees, I ordered the Tre Funghi pasta (oyster, white and baby portobellos) in a super delicious cream sauce with house-made pasta-I forget what kind, but it was similar to penne, only a little thicker and cut in half length-wise.  He ordered the gnocci with brown butter and broccoli rabe sprinkled with parmesan. Our server came back to let us know there was an issue with the broccoli rabe and asked what veg her preferred instead, but he just went with chef's recommendation, so it came paired with spinach.  Still good.  All in all, I'd say our experience was a good one.  Good food, good drinks and good service by Danny (at least I think that's his name, oops!)

This place is EASILY one of my favorite spots in Arizona.    First off, it's Middle Eastern food.  Second, the prices are very very reasonable.  Third, no matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me.   I have had a lot of items on the menu, but I typically gravitate towards the Greek salad (lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber, fat chunks of sheep milk feta, and their AMAZING dressing) $5.99 for a large salad that includes some pita.  I also really enjoy their vegetarian plate, which comes with: falafel, tzatziki, pita, tabooli, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush (but I sub for hummus). $7.99 for two meals worth of food!!  Any and all dining cohorts have equally enjoyed their food selections, and usually go back for more:) In addition to all the veg options, they also have chicken/lamb/beef stuffs and they even have a tongue sandwich! (Ew to me, yum to people I know).  I really dig their beverage options: pomegranate juice, sodas, iced tea with a familiar flavor that I can't quite figure out, yogurt soda, lemonade flavored with rose water (my favorite!).    In addition to having delicious food, great service and low prices, they also have a grocery store on the opposite side of the restaurant.  It's great!  Lots of great ingredients that are hard to find in a regular grocery store.  They even have all the fixings for your hookah enthusiasts.    The walls are adorned with "Best of Phoenix" awards dating back to the 80's, and it's no wonder.    I give them two BIG thumbs up!

My girlfriend I and had both enjoyed meals here before, so we were happy to return for some tasty food and great service.  Let's just say it's not quite what we remembered.  We were seated and it took several minutes for a server to come our way.  We were looking over the menu and decided to both get their lunch combo with the idea of ordering a couple of desserts later.  I chose the borscht and an arugula salad that was to come with shallots, cheese and preserved lemon (my favorite!) and my girlfriend chose a pasta and a salad.    So, after some time our food arrived and I looked at my salad...no preserved lemon anywhere:(  I was trying to find our server, but she was MIA.  I ate it anyway, and I might add it was good, as was my gf's food.    Then we ordered the house-made mozzarella with candied green garlic, mushrooms and the option, for two dollars more, to add a fried egg.  When it came out, it was topped with a pickled egg, purslane, almonds, balsamic vinegar and came on top of toast.  None of the ingredients matched  what we read.  When we were finally able to get our server's attention, she didn't even know what was going on.  Bummer.  At last, we decided to order dessert.  I picked the strawberry tart with vanilla gelato and my gf picked some type of chocolate mousse that sounded divine.  Somewhere around 15-20 minutes later, our server came up to our table and said "I've gotta be honest with your girls, the health inspector just got here and the kitchen isn't sending out any food while they're here."  I'm a server...have been for 8 years, and I've never heard of a restaurant halting service due to a health inspection (unless they found something gnarly).    All in all it was a pretty disappointing experience, given what I have seen from this place in the past.  The food was good, but the service was lackluster at best.  Better luck next time!

I have enjoyed some tasty food here in the past, but I won't be stepping foot in here again.  One of their bouncers, who refers to himself as "G", decided that it would be completely acceptable to let some transphobic words escape his mouth.  Now, in no way am I a transgender individual, but I do have much respect for the trans community and I can't believe this place would keep this dude around.    So, my girlfriend had to use the restroom and there was a huge line, so she peeked around to see if there was the same traffic jam by the guys bathroom and this dude just comes at her all aggressive like telling her she needed to get away and all that...which she was quick to move and apologize.  But then she asked him, "What if I was a transgender person?" To which this guy replied "Well then you can get out."  Really dude?  So, she informs the manager of this and he was on her side for sure.  The bouncer then began harassing her again and was trying to kick her out of the bar (for what?! Right...he didn't say) and she called to the manager that he was still being aggressive with her.  The three of them went to have a talk and the bouncer was trying to say that she called him the "N" word...UM MY GIRLFRIEND IS BLACK TOO JACKASS!  She never uses that word and would NEVER call someone that because she actually is a respectable person and isn't ignorant.  Did the manager say anything to the bouncer about his transphobic comment??  Did he?! NO!! I later called to ask what the manager's name was, and found out that not only is Gavin a manager but he's also part owner...you've got to be kidding me.  It's a real shame when you let your employee harass a guest who didn't do anything but try to go pee.  Yelp folk, whether you're gay, straight, bi, queer, trans, a straight ally or something of the like, I strongly urge you to steer clear of this establishment and spend your money where this kind of behavior is not tolerated.

Ok people, I must say that I have been very hesitant to hit this spot up because of all the hype.  That being said, I found myself pleasantly surprised.  Cute little place, with friendly staff. Thankfully we  didn't have to wait very long (plus!) and the food came out pretty quickly (double plus).  I ordered a mixed local greens salad (literally just mixed greens and vinaigrette) and my friends ordered something similar to mine, but it had skewered salami/cheese on top.  All three of us were happy with our starter, and then came the pizzas.  I ordered The Marinara (marinara and garlic no cheese) and added organic roasted mushrooms for three bucks.  It was quite tasty and I ended up eating the ENTIRE pizza.  Don't judge me, I was hungry.  My one friend ordered the pizza with pistachios and onion and I can't remember what friend number two ordered (oops), but they were both pleased as punch with their pies.  All in all, it was a nice dining experience.  The food was good, but I don't think I would wait multiple hours to enjoy a slice.  However, if the wait isn't crazy, I'll hit this cozy little spot up again, for sure!

Sometimes, when something is considered amazing by everyone I feel less inclined to try because I feel that my expectations will be too high.  This is surely not the case with Durant's, but I'm guessing you probably already knew that.  I can't believe how late I am to jump on the praise train!  I took a handsome fella here the other night to celebrate his birthday and we had a superb time.  Our server Angela was on top of her game; very knowledgeable about the menu and gave great unobtrusive service.    We started with the oysters Rockefeller (my half sans bacon, thanks for being accommodating!) and they were killer!  Each of our entrees came with soup or salad (we each got salads which were pretty standard), then for our main course I ordered the 8oz fillet and he the 12oz.  They were cooked to medium rare perfection and seasoned just right. The dinner was great, but unfortunately we were too stuffed to try dessert. I know, I'm surprised too...  Next time, I might skip the appetizer to save room for some dessert!

So, I have heard lots of buzz about Barrio, but for some reason I never stopped in.  My bad!    We went out for a little Christmas eve date night, and were delighted.  We had a short wait before being seated, so we bellied up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  I ordered something with grapefruit soda and juice and I think vodka? Tequila?  Boo!! Whatever it was, it was delicious.  The lady ordered a margarita, which was equally tasty (and strong!).   We started off with a spinach and cheese crepe, which lasted about five seconds. It was that good!  My lady ordered a seafood dish for me (fish, shrimp, little scallops) with grilled zucchini.  Topped with a creamy sauce and chorizo! AHHH! I didn't realize what it was until I bit in and immediately spit it out.  Sorry peeps, I just don't get down with the swine!  The rest of the dish, however, was magnificent!  Succulent little scallops, flaky fish morsels and juicy shrimp! I don't eat animal stuffs that often, but this was definitely worth the backslide.  Overall, we had a great time and can't wait to go back!!

A vegan writing about a BURGER joint?!  Yes, it's true.  This place really does give me mixed emotions.  Here's the deal, they have an amazing selection of all craft beers (around 50 plus seasonals), they have a decent selection of local brews, by the way and they do have something for the veggie lovers.  If you order the grilled vegetable panini sans aioli and cheese, you're in the clear.  The baguettes are vegan (not the brioche buns, obvs) and they have a few salads that can be modified.  They also have a tasty gazpacho with avocado and (minus the goat cheese).  The fries are good, but I'm kind of over the whole sweet potato fries thing.  Back to the booze.   They have flights (three 5-ounce beers of your choosing, or preselected)!  They offer tasty martinis and wine, and have a fairly extensive liquor cabinet.  The staff is friendly and the vibe is pretty cool.  They are open until 2am, everyday so it's nice for those of you who like a late night snack or if you're preggs.  One more thing, they do use Niman Ranch beef, so at least you're eating grass fed beef and not contributing to the nasty system that feeds poor cows antibiotic-laden corn.  That is all.

So, I ate here the night of the Pickwick show and then again a week later, and I can confidently say I'm a huge fan!  My dining companion and I sat inside in a cute little corner of the restaurant.  Our server, Tom, was great! Attentive but not hovering, funny, and accommodating.    I ordered a glass (or two) of the Pillsbury Wild Child, which is one of my faves!  We started with the grilled veggie plate (lots of tasty grilled/chilled veggies lightly drizzled with olive oil and a side of bread), then we ordered a mushroom pizza on the gluten-free crust.  We asked Tom if we could sub goat cheese for the cow stuff and he totally made it happen.  What a guy!  It was effing delicious, I couldn't even tell the crust was sans gluten.    The look of the place and adorable, very cozy and cute.  Good location and really nice for a date:) I'm sure most of you have already enjoyed Cibo, but if you haven't....well, get yourself together and head down!

Ok, so I have heard all the hype over Matt's and just never thought to go, as I don't usually have the patience to wait 2 hours to eat.  Fortunately, the missus and I had this morning off together and thought it might be easier to get in for breaky.  The wait was about 15 minutes when we got there, which is nothin.  We were seated at the table why the window and were greeted promptly.  I had a coffee and we both had fresh squeezed oj.  We both opted for the cheese omelette with mushrooms and onions, I had whole grain toast and she had sourdough that was served with house-made preserves (the bread, I learned, comes from Wildflower Bakery) and it was soooo effing good!  The hashbrowns were magical, all golden brown delicious on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle. We also shared a waffle for a breakfast-style dessert.  It was very good and I will definitely go back for more!!

I really do enjoy this bar.  They have a great jukebox, pool table and tasty beers/liquor.  On one of my more memorable trips to Shady's I started with and Irish coffee...not wanting to get all jacked up on caffeine, I asked if the bartender had decaf.  He looked around and reported back with a no, but had a great idea: hot chocolate with whipped cream-flavored vodka!! Helllllo!  It was effing delicious.    One downside about this joint is that I never feel hipster/rockabilly enough, but the bartenders are super chill so if you don't have side swept bangs, flannel, tons of tattoos or a big beard, don't fret...you're still welcome to join the party.

I'm always down with supporting local businesses, but local and gay makes my heart sing.  The food is always consistent and the service staff has always been very nice.  Our favorite server, though, is Marcus.  He's GREAT!!! The passion sangria is to die for, but be careful, the buzz creeps up on you:)  I love the chicken tortilla soup with avocado crema and the paella (minus sausage) is top notch.  The only negative thing I have to say is, should you order dessert, skip the tortilla bread pudding.  We ordered it once and didn't like it, so the next time we dined here the girl that served us came over and wanted to buy us dessert because she still felt bad about it!

We decided we wanted something new.  So, I of course turned to Yelp to help us.  After reading some of the reviews, we decided upon Greektown.  When we pulled into the parking lot there was only one car...I wasn't sure if that was a good sign or not.  Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by the owner and were told that we could sit anywhere we'd like.  We chose one of the booths, it was nice and cozy and private.  There were several specials written up on the wall, but they were all meaty, so I took to the menu.  On this particular night, I was hankering for some cheese...don't judge me.  My lady was looking at the Spanikopita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with spinach and feta) and I wanted to get the Tiropita (baked phyllo dough stuffed with feta), as we were trying to decide which one to get, our server (the owner) offered to do half and half for us.  Sweet!!  As we were waiting for the appetizer, he brought us out some fresh pita and tasty garlic bread.  When the app came out, it was piping hot and oh so good!  Came with a side of Tzatziki for dipping, but I just ate mine plain.  For entrees, I ordered the pasta with veggies (tomatoes, mushrooms, zucchini, red onion) which came with a choice of their tomato sauce or the lemony garlic.  I opted for the lemony garlic.  Our entrees came with little Greek salads, which came out with the meals.  I liked my dish...although I did have to order a side of lemon wedges cause I love things extra tart.  I can't remember exactly what my girl ordered, but I know there was rice and potatoes and tomato sauce, and she ate almost all of it.  The salad was only so so...it had creamy dressing and I wanted a little more punch from it...perhaps a little acid in there to kick it up a bit.  The portions were very generous and we both needed a take out container.  Don't think we stopped there, though!  We ordered the house-made chocolate mousse.  It was DAMN delicious!  We ate every last spoonful.  The owner was a very nice and helpful guy, not too much and not too little.  As I said before, the portions are large and the prices are not.  Check it out, you'll be glad you did.

I have been sick as of late and I had a HANKERING for some hot and sour soup.  So, I took my sick self down the street and was delighted to find out how cheap the food was!!    It looked to be about a quart (family size) of soup, for $4.25! The also had a small size for $2.50. Yesssss!  I ordered two and the vegetarian bowl (steamed veggies with rice and sauce).    The food was so good that I went back for more for dinner.   Quick review: cheap eats, tasty grub, stuff available without meats, food comes out fast!    It's a short review, I know...but sometimes short and sweet is just what the doctor ordered.

I absolutely adore this place!    I've stopped in many times, mostly to just to stand and look at all of the pretty things.  However, my spidey sense started tingling the other day, and what do you know, a sale!  Of course!!  I went to the back room where the sale was happening, and was super pleased to see that it was (and still is) a half-off sale.  I have always wanted a pair (or thirty) of Toms, but I've always had a hard time swallowing the $60 price tag.  Much to my delight, there were lots of Toms available on sale:)  In addition, there was a decent selection of half-off clothing, other shoes, stuff for dudes, stuff for kids, and such.  Ok, now back to the rest of the store.  I love how all of their items are unique and much of the jewelery appears to be one of a kind.  They have locally made candles, soaps and lip balms, stuff for babies/young children, nail polish, cards, wallets, a Merkin set (for you gals who need a little coverage), and more that I can't remember right now.  The ladies behind the counter are always quick to greet, are pleasant, and are very helpful (when needed).  Frances, I think you're just peachy keen!

Ever since I was a little kid, I have always had a special place in my heart for things with history.  I love getting lost in a sweet little antique store and finding hidden gems, that's why I love Qcumberz so much!!  They truly have a great selection of furniture, books, music, lighting fixtures, etc.  And what's great about them is that they aren't overpriced.  I always find things there that are fairly priced.  Some places around town have great wares, but want millions for them.    The last time I was in, the owner (I'm guessing) came over and asked what items/what era I was looking for.  Super nice guy, very friendly without being up in my business the whole time.  Informed me they had layaway available and then let me do my perusing in peace.    Highly recommend this spot!

Peeps, let's get real for a second:  when I go thrifting, I absolutely hate how dirty some places can be.  This place is like a beautiful, sparkling gem. I mean, reallllllly clean!  Off to a great start, if I do say.  The ladies working that day were all very nice and helpful, as I had several questions and needed to use the toilet.  Clothing is nicely arranged, and all items and pretty easily accessible.  The day that I shopped there, all blue tag items were a whopping dollar!  Score.  While I didn't find anything on my first trip, I am happy to say I will be heading there soon to try and find a glorious Christmas/Hanukka/Kwanzaa/other this-time-of-year-holiday sweater.    See you soon, Flo!

Came here the other night after my birthday dinner, cause we had a hankering for something cold and delicious.  Gelato 64 did not disappoint!  They have four cases of flavors, two rows deep with lots of fruit flavors as well as more decadent/chocolately ones.  My lover boy grabbed a medium peanut butter oreo and I opted for a small chocolate fudge brownie.  In addition to the frozen treats, they also have hot or cold coffee beverages and smoothies.    We each got our scoops in a cup, but they also offer sugar and waffle cones if you like to eat the vessel from which you eat.  It's hotter than balls outside, go get some gelato!

So, I have mostly been to the little grocery store and not the actual farmers market (as I usually am at work when the peeps are peddling their wares.)  I was fortunate enough to hit it on Saturday, however, and man oh man, wow!!  There were so many people and dogs and everything!  There was much to take in: multiple small farms with their veggies and fruits (and most of them were selling their seedlings, too!), pickled things, salsa and hummus and other dips, breads, sweets, hand-made soaps and lotions, house plants, tamales, live music, food trucks galore, voter registration (which I totally did and you should, too!), grass-fed beef, eggs, crafts, house items, and more!  I loved walking around and seeing what everyone had to offer.  People seemed in such good spirits there and I had a blast.  Can't wait to go back and actually buy some stuff ( I was too awestruck to know what I wanted).

I always love coming to Sprouts. They have am excellent selection of extremely reasonably priced produce, and they carry a lot of healthy alternatives compared to other grocery stores. Their bulk section is great, too. The have bulk sugars, flours, dried fruits, legumes, granola, veggie chips, and more. I really enjoy the new-ish line of coconut milk and almond milk yogurts and their great supplement/personal hygiene section is top notch!

The owners of this bar need a serious reality check. This is a divey bar in Central Phoenix, not some swanky Scottsdale club. They took out the pool table and replaced it with a flat screen tv and couches that probably would do better in my mom's house...oh right, and the "art" they picked up at Big Lots (hung on the wall with caution tape around it hahahaha) is priceless.  A few years back, my then girlfriend and I decided to hit up Z Girl for St. Patrick's day, as they were advertising no cover before 9pm.  We go there with at least an hour to spare, cool right? No, one of the owner's, Char, started going around the bar after 9pm hit and asked us for our $5 cover.  Excuse me? What part of "no cover before 9pm" did I not understand?    Also, I was asked if I could play a gig here some time ago and I said sure.  Char's partner (her name escapes me) called and when I said hello she goes, "uh...wait, um who am I calling again? Is this Jennifer?" Um, ok really?! Can you please be sort of professional?  Anyway, we started chatting about the details of the gig, like how long I would play, what I charged and so on.  She calls me back and asks if I would be willing to charge less (I only asked for $100 bucks and was going to be bringing in a lot of people) and that they would be charging at the door...how does that make sense?  I said no, of course, and ended up not doing the show.   All in all, this place is a complete waste of time and money.  The dj plays crappy oldies/disco...no thanks.  The only good thing I can say about this dump is that the bartender Machelle is always super nice and friendly and Fantasia and her queens make for a fun show on Friday night.

This review can be applied to any and all Quick Trip locations.  I have, on many occasions, gone out of my way to stop in QT over other gas stations, because not only are they much much nicer, but they are very clean and offer a ton of gas station fare (drinks, shakes, coffees, juices, snacks, etc).  I really appreciate how quickly they work, with cashier's that are able to take care of two customers at once.  I usually abhor using gas station bathrooms because, let's face it, we've all been there and seen how putrid they can be, but whenever I visit QT they are always clean! They mop, sweep, clean the bathrooms, windex the doors...and for that I applaud you all, thanks for the cleanliness:D

Number 100!! I'll keep it short and sweet.  It's rare that I get out to the farmers market these days, but when I do, I head straight for McClendon's.  I love their huge selection of organic produce with lots of heirloom varieties.  There are always employees around to chat with, and I LOVE that Chef Payton Curry hangs out to answer questions about food and how to prepare, etc.  Bob McClendon is a super nice man who really does care about the food he produces and won't send out sub-par ingredients.  Their prices are very reasonable and their fruits and veggies are delicious!    During the summer heat, McClendon farm doesn't come to the farmer's market, so I guess I'll have to find someone else to use for my local veggie obsession.    Thanks McClendon family for all that you do, and the lovely food you provide!

This is a pretty multifaceted place: it's a natural bakery for pups, groomers are here to make your four-legged children look their best, they have extra washing tubs so that you may wash your dog, they have lots of natural dog foods/dog toys to chose from, they have some fun holiday toys in right now (repping Christmas and Chanukka!) they are super GLBTQ friendly, and they have a daycare in the back. I bring my pooch here on the regular for the doggy daycare...$13/5 hours or less and $20 for anything over 5 hours.  They are open til 7, so it's a nice treat for dogs with parents who work all day.  They also sell packages, so to speak, for the daycare ($90/five days, can be used randomly and not necessarily five days in a row, good for 3 months).  Friendly staff.  I wish I could remember her name, but the girl that is usually there when I drop of Mr. Man has black hair, glasses and a nose piercing and one above her upper lip (maybe it's Sammy?)...she's really cool and she always greets my dog like they're buds.  Rad.

I can't believe I haven't yelped about these lovelies yet!  Here's the skinny: if you're a member of Massage Envy, you get one massage (full body/one hour) for 39 bucks a month and if you don't use your massage they just accumulate...which for chicks like me is a good thing, cause I loves me some two hour massages.  I yelp five stars based on my experiences with two therapists, Yvonte and Mike T.  Yvonte is my go to guy when I need some deep tissue help and Mike is great for stretching or when I have sciatic pain.  I have never had a bad experience with either sir and I will continue to visit this house of tranquility.  I have always received great customer service here, from the call to schedule my appointment to the fond farewell as I leave all fuzzy and drunk with relaxation.

I haven't visited Bertha in a while, but she still has quite a hold on me.  I am kind of a creature of habit, and so I usually get the same sandwich, but they have a great selection of house baked goods, sandwiches, soups and salads.  The lemonade is fresh and delicious and the staff is super nice.  It's kind of tucked back in the corner of the little strip mall it's in, so you have to keep your eyes open.  They have indoor and outdoor seating, which is great when the weather is permits.  They always have good jams playing, too.

Ok, I'm torn.  I dig this the atmosphere, with its trendy vibe and blue lights and the super rad lamp at the end of the bar.  The drinks are very tasty, and happy hour lasts until 6:30.  I usually get the red sangria or one of their drunken Italian sodas (Italian soda with vodka, yes!!)...I plan on ordering the Blackberry Kir Royal next time, however, cause it sounds fancy and yummy. I took myself on a brunch date here once and ordered a mimosa for 3 bucks, and when it came out is was an entire carafe...for THREE DOLLARS!  My challenge to this place is for them to kick it up a bit as far as the food goes.  I mean, it's not bad...but when I think to myself "Self, where would you like to grab a bite to eat?" this place isn't on the top of my list.  I want food that makes me salivate when I think about it. I want a place that calls to me from afar, tempting me to rush back in.  The service is usually pretty good, especially when Chrissy is serving it up.  As far as vegan fare, they had an amazing vegan chili for the month of January...but if they wanted, I would totally be ok with them putting it on the menu for realsies.  I am able to veganize a fair amount if their food (pitas and salads), and they have a black bean soy burger that can be made vegan if you get it without the bun and aioli.  All in all, we will definitely be back, as we like to support local and lgbtq businesses.  :)

Wow...I don't even know where to start.  (The beginning...that's usually a good place)  So, the little lady and I had just finished up with yoga, and Switch was in the very near vicinity,  so we figured it'd be a good choice.  Wrong.  We were greeted in a somewhat timely fashion and seated.  Then we waited for a while...and then a little more.  The hostess was wiping off a nearby table and asked if we had been helped yet, and when we said no, she went to find our server.  Apparently he didn't know we were his table.  Ok, it's happened to me before, I'm willing to forgive.  Our server, Chris, came over and we ordered our food and drinks.  He came back with our bevs and then he didn't stop by again until food came out, meanwhile we had pushed both of our empty water glasses and my empty coffee mug to the end of the table...hoping that he would get the hint.  Nope.  Then the food came and he finally asked if we wanted more to drink.  He dropped off water and coffee and was gone until the END of our meal (which wasn't even good).  Was this a joke?  He comes over and says "So, how is everything guys?" My woman replied with "I've had better, can we please get the check?" and he didn't even ask what was wrong.  He brought the check and we were going to split it down the middle, and he said they were having system issues and couldn't split it.  Fine, one card...just get us the eff outta here!  When he brought the card back he literally tossed it on the table and told us to have a good day as he was walking away.  Yeah, where's the manager?  I told the manager all about our sucky experience and our even suckier server.  I was given some excuse that their computer systems were down due to a hacking of sorts and blah blah blah...give me a break.  I understand things running a bit slow due to a computer problem, but NEVER coming to check on our meal and us having to ask a different server to please get us condiments and then to not even acknowledge when we tell you we've had better...that's not a computer issue.  That's a server who doesn't care about good business and doesn't know how to do his job.    We were given a comp card for the next time we come in, but really I doubt that will happen.   It's a shame, because I really do love supporting local gay businesses.  But they make it so damn hard with their declining service and mediocre food.  Switch, our relationship must come to an end, because when it comes down to it...it's not me, it's you.

I just finished all of my classes in culinary school and now it's time to put those classes to the test during my externship.  The knife kit they gave us was pretty lame so I wanted to get something better.  I talked to teachers, other students and co-workers and everyone said go to Phoenix Knife House.  Eytan, the owner, promptly greeted me and asked what I was looking for.  I explained my need for a new chef's knife and he placed about 15 knives in front of me, all ranging in price and size.  He helped me decide without being pushy, and I could tell he wasn't trying to get me to buy the most expensive, which is a quality you can't find in a lot of people.  I ended up picking out a Japanese knife that was moderately priced.  Then I said I needed to look at paring knives and he helped me with that, too.  In addition to knives, they also have chef's coats, pants, hats and aprons (all in different colors, styles, and sizes), they have peelers, microplanes, tweezers (long ones), spoons, etc. You can also bring your knives in for a good sharpening ($3-$5 per knife). I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a good knife/chef supplies and appreciates impeccable customer service.  I will DEFINITELY be back, as I think this is my new favorite store!

So, I visited this record store once before, back when they were next to Copper Star.  They have since moved locations and greatly expanded.  I felt like I was walking into a scene from High Fidelity.  The dudes behind the counter were super chill, and answered all of my many (probably a bit annoying) questions about turntables and speakers.  Though I didn't buy a turntable (I was informed that I needed a receiver and they didn't have one at that time) I still walked out with two Stevie Nicks albums and one by the Fleet Foxes.  I can't wait to get the gear so I can listen to my new stuff, and I will certainly be back for more music.  They have a huge selection of all genres, and they are reasonably priced, too!  For every ten bucks you spend you get a little punch on your punch card, and once it's filled (I think) it's good for ten dollars off your next purchase.   All in all, I'd say they spun me right round...ok, bad joke.  Keep it real.

Ah, I love this store.  It's my sweet little haven for all of my rainbow needs.  The place is tiny, but tucked inside are many splendid things.  Lots o' leather/bondage stuff and toys..and I don't mean Toys 'R Us.  I really love the clothing for us ladies, cause maybe I wanna wear some tight, corsette-y, short skirt-y, high heel pump-y things around the house sometimes.  In addition, they also have gay-pride everything, bumper stickers, greeting cards, jewelry, books and mags, etc.  Seriously though, the customer service is top-notch and they are always able to answer any questions I have. Thanks Patrick for keeping it Roy G. Biv.

While I don't really buy a whole lot from here, I love walking the aisles of bulk goods.  They are very reasonably priced, especially when it comes to food.  A huge bag of spinach for three bucks?!  A large container of organic raspberries for around four dollars!?  Yes please!  Also, we have a kitty with asthma and the vet told me that her prescription would be around $60-$70.  Well, my deal-finding spidey senses told me otherwise, and I stopped at the pharmacy and found that it was only $27 there. Win!  I also make good use of my Costco membership at the pump, because while other gas stations are advertising gas at over three dollars a gallon, I was pumping for $2.99/gal.  I like that they have more than just food and house supplies, they have electronics, a photo developing department, movies/dvds/blue ray, books, flowers, personal hygiene items, perfumes, a cafeteria, pet supplies, and more.

I know...I'm on a bit of a 5 star streak, but I just can't help it!!  When things are great, I just have to tell you about it!!  So, my two front tires were pretty much bald...yikes!  I kept seeing pieces of tires in the road and a friend of mine recently had a tire blowout. I took them as signs from the Universe to take heed and get some fresh wheels on my sweet little hoopty.    I walked in and was greeted immediately.  The guy (Michael, I think) was super nice and helpful, he even asked if I'd like to get email reminders when it's time to get the tires rotated, which I think is just lovely.    He offered me a cold bottle of water, thankfully, cause it was a real doozy today, and I took a seat in the lobby.  He told me it would be about 30-45 minutes, perfect.  About 15 minutes later I heard my name being called. "Already?!" I asked in disbelief.  Yes, already!  They were pretty busy, so I was EXTRA impressed.    Every time I have stopped in, these guys are always very professional and super helpful/nice/awesome.  Like other Yelpers before me, I can't sing their praises enough, either.  Cheers to you tire dudes, cheers to you.

We stopped in for some tasty vegan fare the other day, and man oh man was it delicious!  We both ordered the fresh lemonade, which I gulped down in 2 seconds...yeah, it was that good! We started with the Lotus Salad (lotus root,carrots, cabbage, etc. lots of crunch) which was to die for! The flavors were spot on and the colors in the dish were nice and vibrant. I ordered a spicy lemongrass soup with noodles and tofu and the little woman ordered a mock-beef lemongrass noodle entree, both of which were superb.  The only reason I'm giving this place four stars instead of five is because the dessert was kind of a bust.  We ordered one slice of carrot cake and a slice of chocolate cake.  They ended up being out of the carrot cake, totally not a big deal (even though my heart was a little broken over it) so we ordered 2 slices of the chocolate cake.  They were rather huge and looked tasty, but the cake itself was suuuuper dry, almost like I was chewing on...well something not soft.  I worked in a vegan restaurant back in the day and have totally had soft and moist vegan cakes.  The cake had many layers that were filled with frosting and fruit fillings. I felt like it kind of lacked flavor and I think they can do better.  I wouldn't get the cake again, but the rest of the meal was fantastic and the service was good, too.

I have found my new favorite veg friendly restaurant!  First off, everything is organic and as local as possible.  They don't have any mock meats, just pure food.  They have salads, wraps, soup, desserts, starters, and entrees.  Everything is vegetarian but can be made vegan, and a good portion of their items are raw.  They have a wide variety of loose leaf teas (can be ordered in a small or large press), they have healthy shooters (I love the Alkalize Now), elixers, house-made almond milk (tastes divine with the Vanilla Rooibos tea!!), iced tea and more.  As for the food, whoa mama! It's a culinary slam dunk in my opinion.  I have had several dishes here, including: The Rawvacado Wrap with the nut cheese substitute, the Nori Rolls (I drool), The Kaleidescope Salad (seeds, nuts, fresh herbs, kale, carrots, celery, lemon vinaigrette, side of bread), and let's not forget the amazingly vegan/raw desserts.  My favorite is the vanilla bean cheesecake! So good we had to order more!  This place is a tad pricey for some, but for the quality of food you're getting, think of it as a tiny investment towards good health.  The vibe is super chill and laid back and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  When the bill is presented, they even give you a small bowl of fennel seeds to "help cleanse your palte and aid in digestion"!  Will definitely continue coming here for great, healthy food!

I'm obsessed.  Plain and simple, I love Urban Yoga.  They offer a wide range of classes (beginners-experts, kids yoga, gong yoga, candlelight yoga) with all types of instructors.  I signed up for two weeks of unlimited yoga for a measly twenty five bucks.  I feel great! I really enjoy the Astonga class or any other classes taught by Danielle Godfrey.  I feel like she really gets it...what I mean by that is that she knows how to teach and knows how to come over and adjust you in just the right way for awesome things to happen.   The classes start early in the morning and go through til around 7:30pm.  In addition to yoga classes, they also have a ton of yoga gear (clothes, mats, etc.), books for trading, jewelry, and more.  I look forward to each class and have noticed changes in my body already!  The space is super chill and clean and I highly recommend you try it out for yourself as soon as possible.    Namaste.

(Here's my disclaimer:  I usually think Fox restaurants are pretty meh...not bad and just good enough.  However, True Food is the exception.)  Ugh, last Sunday was a REAL whammy at work, so I told the woman we were going out for food and drinks and on me.  Thankfully, she picked a place that would have more than one item for me to eat.    Each time we visit True Food we're greeted promptly and by friendly staff. We've never experienced a wait longer than five or ten minutes and the atmosphere is nice and bright, especially considering what I used to be (anyone? Coffee Plantation?? Ugh..that bathroom always reeeeeked! I digress)   Anyway, on this particular stop I ordered the Spontaneous Happiness (a cocktail with St. Germain, lime, and ginger/vanilla infused sochu) and m'lady opted for the Apple Carrot and Ginger tonic  to start.  My bev was silky smooth and went down way too fast.  So, then we ordered a bottle of Moscato. What? I was in the mood for sweet drinks...I'm allowed to be frou frou once in a while.    For our appetizers, we ordered the Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce Cups (tofu, cashews, garlic and a gingery sauce) and the Local Vegetable Crudites (fresh veggies from McClendon's farm that came with tzatziki and olive tapenade...neither of which worked for us, so the server brought it with hummus and a champagne vinaigrette instead!! YUM!).  Then we moved on to the Tuscan Kale salad (kale, lemon vinaigrette, Parmesan, and breadcrumbs) sans cheese.  For entrees (I know, it was a feast) she ordered the Shirataki Noodles, and I ordered another Tuscan Kale....it's that good, peeps.    When dessert time came around, we decided on their chocolate pudding (vegan) that came topped with walnuts and pistachios.    Our server (I can't remember her name and I feel like a jerk about it) was rad, the food was perfect and the drinks were divine!

Oh...my...lanta! I can't believe I haven't visited this little gem sooner! It's nestled atop a Pei Wei and Starbucks so I wasn't sure what to expect.  But from the moment I walked up the dimly light stairway and into the bar, I knew it was going to be a great night.  So first off, they open at 4 and happy hour is until 7pm.  (20% off everything on Sundays!!). They have a huge selection of different booze and brews and their specialty cocktails are definitely something that sets them apart from other bars.  I loves me some Moscow Mule, so when I saw that they had one on the menu (in a real copper mug!!) I ordered one immediately.  It was so tastilicious that I had to order a second.  For my next drink, I tried the Retro Cooler, which in my opinion, is as cool as it gets...think Matthew McConaughey in Dazed and Confused.  It's a mix of St. Germaine (Elderflower liquer) with Champagne and a lemon twist.  It went down the ole' hatch super easy, though, so be careful!  The second time I enjoyed this bar I ordered the White Rabbit (no...it's not vegan and they don't have a milk substitute...I cheated!)  It has Godiva White Chocolate liquer, horchata, stoli vanilla and some other yumness.  This one tasted like candy and I drank it in about five seconds.  Anyway, besides the drinks, they also have a few light snacks like hummus, artichoke dip, etc.  The vibe in this place is super chill and I really dig the way the bar is set up; the backdrop has big circle cutouts with yellow lights behind. There are comfy couches and high top tables and of course seats at the bar.  I almost felt like I was going to see Shane and Alice from the L Word walk in.  On our last visit, it was pretty busy as it was a holiday weekend and there was a dj.  The people of SideBar definitely know what they're doing and I will certainly be back!

Have been here twice now, and both times my tastebuds were tickled with delight. They serve breakfast until 4pm, which is a gift from above, as I love me some breky in the afternoon.  I ordered the roasted turkey omelette, sans turkey and instead with asparagus added, with onions and peppers and oooey, gooey, delicious brie cheese! Also comes with a side of rosemary potatoes, a choice of side AND toast.  Not too shabby for 10 bucks.  The server was sweet and accommodating and the coffee mug was huge...just what the doctor ordered.  Thanks kids, I'll be heading back for my Daily Dose very soon!

A friend of mine recently invited us to join for his birthday dinner at Fogo. My initial thought was "what am I going to be able to eat here?!"  but was assured that their salad bar was "banging".  So, alas we arrive and the woman and I hit up the bar while we waited for our peeps.  She got a really great dark beer and I tried to go outside of the box and ordered a melon martini.  It was terrible, but I didn't want to send it back cause it was kind of my own fault.  The bartender, however, noticed my full glass and asked if there was something else he could get for me.  Thank you sir!!!  I got a glass of Malbec instead, and it was great.  Our friends arrived, and we were seated.  It was like a whirlwind of craziness after.  Our server twirled on over and explained super fast how the place worked and what it was all about.  He went around asking what we all wanted to drink, and when he got to my lady, he called her sir...annoying.  She clearly is a woman.  Whatev, stuff happens sometimes when you're high on meat fumes.  After he was done with our drink order, we all got up to grab some salad.  Now, I know that this place is a meat house, but if you're gonna charge me 23 bones for my salad bar, please, make it great!  I grabbed some lettuce and started walking around to see what else I wanted.  There were these huge asparagus piled high, so I grabbed a few.  Then I grabbed some green beans, huge beet slices and broccoli, too.  I went to the dressings and was kind of disappointed.  There were ranch, caesar, and what looked and tasted like zesty Italian from Kraft. Boo.  Everything looked really good, but nothing was seasoned at all.  I mean, I appreciate being given the option to season my own items, but plain bland everything?  I want some flavor people!    Once seated, meat on sticks came from every direction.  It's kind of funny to watch.  Two of my dining companions ordered limeades, and no joke, had to ask for refills from multiple people (at least four times!) before someone came by with a pitcher.    The boyfriend of the birthday boy decided to propose that evening, and asked them to please bring the ring out on the dessert plate, and they did so very well.  I'll give them a star for that.  It was cute and sweet, both literally and figuratively.  I just ordered an after dinner coffee for my dessert, and everyone seemed please with their treats.  Ugh, then when it came time to pay, we decided that I would put $100 on my card and the rest was in cash.  When someone FINALLY came by to pick up the bill, I explained this.  He looked very confused. So, I repeated "Just 100 on the card and the rest cash." Simple enough, right?  Not so much.  It literally took about ten minutes for someone else to bring our monies back and when they did, the guy used all the cash and put the remainder of $61 on my card (I'm just glad is wasn't more than what I asked him to put on)...but still, I serve bro! It's not hard to do!  I was completely underwhelmed by my experience here and do not plan on returning.  At least I won't suffer from any meat sweats.  NEXT!

Ok peeps, let's chat.  The lady and I moved to the gayborhood a few months ago and were looking for a new brekky hang out.  Enter Scramble.  Cute place, nice and bright with lots of seating inside and out.  The have large menus on the wall for you to read while standing in line.  They have much to choose from, and for the veg-folk, they have four different vegan options!! I swoon over their vegan French toast, with syrup, Smart Balance, and a side of fruit (but I always order it with the sweet potato hash cause that's better! It's sweet pots mixed with mushrooms and zucchini and rosemary).  They serve vegan items on specific vegan plates and cook with a separate grill, how rad is that?  I truly appreciate their consideration.  Once while I was in there, I had a chance to chat with the owner, and I asked if he was vegan.  He said that he wasn't but that his brother is, so he tries hard to be conscious of the non-animal eating people, and also said that if there was anything that I thought would be good to eat, to let him know and he'd check it out.  Coooool!!

I truly adore the Phoenix Mountains Preserve.  I usually went to Squaw Peak, but after an ankle debacle, I needed something easy to get back in the swing of things.  Enter the Preserve, recommended by a coworker.    I drove on over and was happy to see that there were multiple trails to try.  I asked a fellow hiker what they thought to be a good trail, and so I took #8.  It's nice because it's mostly a scenic hike with a steady incline (mostly).  It's very calm and relaxing out there, as there are usually just a few other hikers.    I like being out in nature and this is the place to get it. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to try something other than the usual hustle and bustle of Camelback or Squaw Peak.

So, I've been to this joint on numerous occasions and each time has been pleasant.  The most recent experience was on Monday night with my lady.  We stopped in after I was done with work.  I was looking over the wine list and our server says, "You know about our deal tonight, right?"  Intrigued and unaware I asked her to please go on, "We have bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20" WHAT?! That was music to my frugal/foodie ears!!  Any bottle of wine and the bruschetta board comes with 4 flavors of your choosing (4 slices of each!).  We chose the Sauvignon Blanc (The Ned) and for the board we got the: buratta, (minus the bacon) arugula, tomato; white bean and chopped tomato; fig (and other stuff  I can't remember) and salami with pesto.  There's a sparkling Sauv, too...but I wasn't really in the mood for bubbles.  For dessert we ordered the creme brulee.  It was pretty good, but I'm kind of a creme brulee snob, and I thought it could have been cooked a little more.  All in all, a great time here at Postino.  We will definitely be back.

I recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give Luci's a try.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by two super friendly barista's, Bryant and Emily. Being my first time here, they were both really awesome helping me pick out what I wanted to eat and drink. This place is really cute and has a lot of awesome food and beverage options. I ordered the Naughty Nurse and an iced latte with almond milk! (really awesome that they offer almond milk...so tired of soy) . It's a nice mix of coffee shop and grocer.  They offer a lot of healthier options, organic/gluten-free/vegetarian and so on.  I highly recommend!

Ok, so I have been using this line of make up for at least seven years now.  I really love the way it looks and feels and was so delighted to see that they had put a whole store full of their minerally, shimmery, powdery wares in the mall.     As soon as I walked in I was greeted by the friendly Michelle.  She asked me what I was looking for and I told her I needed some new brushes and maybe a few new eyeshadows...nothing too crazy.  She was very helpful, and never pushy.  I decided on the baby Kabuki for my new brush and then it was off to the huge round table of color!  I told her of my habit to steer towards browns and that I wanted something a little different...pink maybe? She showed me a really pretty color pink, that was just pink enough and not like I was going walk out of there looking like Barbie.  She showed me on her hand how it would look with and without the eyelid primer.  I preferred it with, and then she showed me on my eyelids.  I preferred very much, so we threw that in the bag, too.  Also, we picked out a shadow brush (she was super helpful, people!! Explaining both brushes for eyeshadow, how they differed and what they would work best for).  Then we moved on to skin care...I'm pretty loyal to my natural brand that I buy from Sprouts, but I told her I needed an exfoliator.  She showed me a rice protein-based powder.  It had not sulfates or parabens, all natural and nice.  So, I got that, too!    Basically, this was a perfect shopping experience from start to finish.  Michelle was there for me when I needed her, but she wasn't trying to get me to buy everything in the store.  I feel good about my purchases and because of my great experience today, I will be back!!

So, the first time I hit this place up I wasn't knocked off my feet, but decided to give them a second chance (and third and fourth).  I think they have kicked it up a notch food and beverage-wise, because everything has become more delicious.  I especially love their happy hour prices!  Veggie tacos for $1.25 each!  House cocktails for five bucks and on Saturday and Sunday, mimosas and bloodies are $5 until 6pm.  Their Bloody Mary was really good, freshly made with tons of fresh dill! Yumski!  We order the chips and guac every time (the guac has chunks of orange in it, which makes for an unexpected burst of citrusy goodness).  Like I said, the veggie tacos are cheap and they are packed with flavor.  I love chilling outside on their patio when the weather is nice.  They use some local purveyors, which really turns my wheels:)  Muy delicioso!

Love love love this place!!!  From the decor to the delicious utilization of local food, this is a place that I highly recommend to everyone!  The Funghi pizza is heaven.  Goat cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil!? Yes!  We often come here for a full meal, but there have been more than a few times of coming just for the chocolate cake.  The owner comes into my job a lot and I asked him what was up with the chocolatey delight.  Apparently they spent three months working on the menu. Time well spent sir:)  We have tried a wide variety of their menu items and haven't been disappointed once.  Great wine at competitive prices, tasty house cocktails and a really fun use of space.  They even have a cute little garden outside.  Oh, and free valet!

I try shopping locally, but it can be tough.  The boys at Stupid Cupid make it a little easier by filling their store with great home decor items.  My favorite is their line of scented candles by Scent of Scandal, with such scents as: Ho Ho Homo (fruitcake), MILF (milk & cookies), 8 inches (Banana), and Crazy Bitch (fruit loops).  They smell great and they're freaking hilarious!  They also have great picture frames, magnets, wall art, cards, a jewelry made by local folks!  Stop on in for some last minute holiday shopping:)

Yowza!!!  How have I not been in this shop til now?!  From the moment I walked through the door I was cracking up.  It's totally a novelty/nostalgia lovers paradise.  For starters, they have tons of candies (old school and new and even some local). I felt like a kid in a candy store...wait, I WAS a kid in a candy store!   Along the wall I found magnets.  Tons of magnets, all of which had something clever or hilarious on them.  There was the "Grow Up To Be Gay" magnet set, a magnet of the early 90's hunks A.C. Slater and Zach Morris (Saved By The Bell...duh), there were magnets with cupcakes and Einstein and everything in between.  Next, I moved to the little cupcake section, where I found cupcake flavored chapstick and toothpaste and wrapping paper covered in happy little sweets.  Then came the bacon spot.  Bacon flavored candies, a bacon wallet, bacon wrapping paper, bandages, candy bacon necklace, a "funky fresh" bacon scented air freshener for the car!    I'll give you a moment to collect yourself...  Next we move on to the mustachery. Finger staches, different celebrity staches to stick on your face, pink ones and skinny John Waters-esque staches. There were even ones to put on your drink, say at a party, to make sure you know which bev is yours.  Love it!  I couldn't believe my eyes at all the greatness....novelty ice cube trays, party favors, sparklers, accent sprays (like for your mouth...for a "gay" or Irish accent lolz).    They even have a photo booth in the store, just in case you weren't having enough fun looking at all the wares!  The dude at the counter was super nice:)  Smeeks, we shall reunite soon!

Been here before and the food was decent, this time was really good.  I got the black bean burger that comes with shiitake mushrooms, cheese (I think Jack) and awesomely good, grilled Maui onions...the bun was perfection! I added the side green salad, and that was also very tasty!  Not only did we have a great server, but each month they pick a different charity to donate to! (I think it's a percentage of their sales on Mondays).  Super cool:)  I also really love what they did with the space...I used to come to this plaza a long time ago to rent videos from Movies on Central (RIP).  They really jazzed the place up while still keeping the integrity of the original.

I absolutely love this little, local gem!  While they are smaller, they have a great selection of all kinds of stuff!  I recently had to rush back down to purchase an other Field Loaf.  It's amazing!  They have several flavors, my favorite being the Lentil Sage or the Wild Mushroom.  Essentially it's a little log made of grains, vegetables and legumes.  Good cold or hot, sliced or chopped.  Amazing!!!  I usually sautee mine and add it to dishes for a meaty texture.  (It's totally vegan).  They have vegan options for cheese and yogurt and ice creams, too.  I also picked up a nice little bag of pink Himalayan salt, which I am now in love with.  They have crackers, pastas, chips, dips, sauces, meats, local veggies and fruits,cleaning supplies, dairy items, olive oils from the Queen Creek Olive Mill, wine (some local) and they have food that's ready to eat in their cafe/deli area.  I love it here, and the friendly staff are always fun to chat with as their bagging up my groceries.  While their prices may seem a little higher, it really isn't when you think about how awesomely local much of their items are!    Can't wait to go back!

So, some friends texted for me to get my keester down to Rips, because they were doing their super rad 80's-style dance party (a.k.a. Obscura). I had just had my fill of two stepping and line dancing at the Cash Inn, so I figured I could use something a little more my style.    It cost five smackers to get in, which included a raffle ticket (for what, I don't know...obvs I didn't win...stop rubbing it in).  They were totally spinning the sweet stylings of 80's bands of yore.  This was my kind of party.  I spotted my friends on the dance floor somehow (it was pretty packed) and jumped right in.  The dance area was darker, with lots of little lights bouncing off from every which way and movies were playing behind the DJ.  I can't comment on the drinks or prices of said beverages, as I was being a responsible driver.    The vibe of this place was great, although I heard that Obscura only happens once a month, so it may very well be different on other nights.  I will definitely be back to get my 80's fix again next month!  Like, gag me with a spoon I must be really freaking out, cause no other Val dude can touch these guys! (anyone?) :)

This quaint little gem is located inside the Galleria downstairs from where I attended classes.  I always got a fruit salad (had lots of red grapes, strawberries, pineapples, no cantaloupe or honeydew YAY!) and either a latte or mocha.  They we nice and worked quickly and they even remembered my name after a few visits, which I think is rather rad, considering how many people come by everyday.  They offer breakfast and lunch items, they have coffees/espresso/teas, power bars, pastries, and the like.  I wish I could say that I will be back, but I'm done with school and it's quite out of the way.  It was great while it lasted, thanks for the great service peeps!

Oh hells yes!  I had driven past this little gem several times and never really gave it much thought.  That is until a friend of mine invited me to join for a bite.  Some may say this place is small, but I say it's quaint.  The menu is pretty big, lots of veggie options:)  I ordered the veggie burrito (mushrooms, spinach, cheese, rice,  etc.) and my friend ordered a few different types of tacos.  I was excited to see how amazing the salsa bar was!  I opted for a creamy cilantro sauce.  It totally kicked up my burrito!!  I could order that burrito each time and use a different salsa and never get bored!    The service was top notch and the prices were very reasonable.  Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!

We recently moved down the street from here and were pleasantly surprised by this little place.  Though the food portions could be considered small (come on people, we as a country could stand to lessen our portions a bit!) I find them to be enough.  The carne asada is good, but I wouldn't say it's the best I've had.  The margarita's are really yummy and the fact that they are on tap makes me love them even more.  The horchata is also note worthy and if you want, they'll even add some booze to it for a small up-charge.  Hey-o!

I just want to add, that since becoming vegan, this is my go to spot for a damn good burrito!  The tortillas are vegan as are the beans, thanks for not using lard peeps!!  Get a bean burrito Terry's way! You'll thank me for this later!  Plus, the regular, tamarindo or jamaica margarita's are all to die for!

Stopped in last night for some take out.  I was very impressed with how nice and knowledgeable everyone was.  I asked if the tortillas were vegan (they were!!) so I asked for two veggie burritos and as they were making them for me, the manager told me that she'd give me a sample of their soup, as it was vegan also.  No need for a sample, sign me up for the full cup!  I love tortilla soup, and theirs is tomato based, weeeeeee!  My burrito came with amazing cilantro lime rice (way more limey than Chipotle), black beans, guac, fajita veggies, pico and medium salsa.  It was divine!  My woman was equally pleased with the outcome of her burrito (rice, beans,fajita veggies, and pico).  When I was a cheese eater, I would order their chips and queso dip, which is totally yumsky.

Was a fan before (when it was Mama Java's) and I am a fan now!  I really dig what they have done with the place.  Gave it a bit of a facelift:)  In addition to having tasty coffee/non-coffee beverages, they also have a nice assortment of house-made pastries (some vegan and/or gluten-free), tasty breakfast scrambles, quiche, a granola waffle?!, lunch sandwiches, artwork, and more!    The peeps behind the counter are delightful and they always have decent tunes playing out over the rooms.  They keep things green by using an ipad as the register, with the option of receiving your receipt by way of email.  Who doesn't love hugging a tree when they purchase a cup of joe?  It's really a great neighborhood hang spot whether you're looking to chill out with a cup and a book or have a mini business meeting or catch up with old friends.

So, after driving past this place dozens of times, I finally decided to stop in.    I walked in and was happy to see a whole wall full of different types of teas (arranged in different colored bags so you know what kind of tea it is, very helpful).  I was cheerfully greeted by the owner, Holly.  She was nice and informative without being pushy or up in my grill.  As a lover of rooibos (red tea) I was deeeefreakinglighted to find a nice selection of my favorite stuff!  I walked back a forth sniffing the teas (they have handy little glass jars full of each tea for you to smell...like scratch and sniff, only better.) I finally decided upon Cinnamon Dandy and Dark Chocolate Rum Cake.  Holy amazeballs, they are yumsky!  I'm already almost out!    The teas are bagged at 50 grams each.  My teas were $6.50 a piece, which I find to be highly reasonable.  I don't know if the other types are a little more, but I'm sure if they are, it's not by much.    In addition to the teas, they also have: cast iron tea pots, candles (some made in house), French presses, sweeteners, etc.  Can't wait to go back and find some more delicious treasures!!

Yowza! It's been a good, long minute since my last review! My apologies.  Anyway, I decided to give this shop a try based on the reviews on saw here on good ole' Yelp.  I really liked what I read, so I checked out the online portfolios to see which artist I liked the best.  I liked them all, but Christopher Robin's work really turned my knobs.  So, off I went!  When I got there, I really was impressed by how super CLEAN the place was.  Literally, reminded me of hospital clean (how it should be!).  Next, I was happy to see that the dude I wanted to chat it up with was sitting right there in front when I walked in.  He was chill and helpful, and started making a rough sketch of what I wanted right away.  He said it was totally going to work out, and I made an appointment to come back in October.    All in all, I had a great first experience, and will be updating my review once I actually get the tattoo.  Stay tuned.

Christopher Robin is the freaking MAN!  I gave him an idea and he made it even more awesome than I could have imagined!  It took two sessions to complete my first tattoo with him, and he is currently fixing/completing a tattoo I started elsewhere.  Trustworthy work, clean shop and great people!! Getchyo ass in and see for yourself.

Ok, so we're on the final countdown til our little one arrives and I have known for quite some time that I'd be cloth diapering my child.  Thankfully, I have a partner in crime who, while isn't crunchy like me, is totally willing to go with the flow of my hippie ways.  Per the recommendation from my midwife, we signed up for a free cloth diapering class here.  The owner is freaking AMAZING!! She really knows her stuff, and is very passionate about keeping our babies safe and free from the garbage they put in disposable diapers and wipes.  She holds the class in the back of the store, and goes through everything.  From diapers for those who have a tighter budget all the way up through to the diapers that are "limited edition" and then some.  I felt like I was just being given all of my options and, at no point, did I feel like she was just out for a sale.  She gives out papers at the end showing you different "packages" that one could potentially put together, depending on budget and diapering desire.  We all got to try out different types on the teddy bear she was using, but while papa bear was totally able to get it down pat, mama bear here didn't feel too confident.  She said that once the baby is here, we are free to bring him or her in and try on different diapers with her assistance so we could get a better feel for them.    In addition to the slew of diapers, they also have detergents, reusable wipes, flushable diaper liners, baby slings, wet bags, diaper rash balm, breast feeding items, teething gear, clothes, toys, and much more.  I can't wait to go back once my little one is here to buy more goods!!

I have mixed feelings about this restaurant.  I mean, on one hand they have a great selection of wine, they have some tasty food items on the menu, and the space is great!  On the other hand, I feel the food is hit or miss...it's not as consistent as one would hope.  I get it, when food is made fresh on the regular, stuff is going to be a little different here and there.  The service has always been great, nice people and informative when I've had questions about the menu.  We usually get the roasted beet appetizer which comes with goat cheese and (I think) walnuts.  Yum!  I've had a fish, beef and chicken entree here..can't say that I enjoyed the fish but the beef and chicken were tasty.  The fig and pecan pie is really outstanding.  I was a little put off when I first read it, because I'm neither a fig nor pecan fan.  But let me tell you, paired with their cream cheese and citrus ice cream that pie is amazeballs.  They have fun house cocktails and a large community table made out of a big piece of beautiful wood.  We came here for my gf's graduation dinner and they were nice and accommodating, although when I let our server know right up front that we were going to need separate checks (already checked to make sure when we called for the reservation and they said it was fine) he gave a little 'tude at first.  I had to explain that I, too, am a server and I know how it is doing split checks (actually it's really not that big of a deal if people tell you up front)...he relaxed after a bit.    Anyway, I still feel lurv for this place and I will continue to come back and try different cocktails/wine/food.

First time here was great! I walked in just to see what the place was like, and was immediately greeted by Joe.  Super chill dude, answered a lot of questions all while working on a piece for someone else.  I began to ask if he could help me fix one of my tattoos, and then we talked about my (hopefully) soon-to-be sleeve.  I already have a cupcake tattoo and wanted to get a friend for it, so Joe drew one up in a couple of minutes and I was thrilled! It was super cute and exactly what I was looking for.  He was poking me with needles and ink shortly thereafter and when he saw that my existing cupcake needed a little touch up, he offered to fill in the spot for free and added some sprinkles:) What a great first time experience!  My newest edition is healing up very nicely, hardly had any itching or scabbing and it looks great!!  I will be coming back to Joe for my sleeve for sure!

So, for our anniversary last week, my love told me to get dressed and that she had some surprises for me.  A surprise?? For me?! I thought to myself, "Sweet!" Actually it turned out to literally be sweet when she told me we were going truffle shopping. Scuse me?! We stopped in and I was overwhelmed by the awesomeness that was before me.  She told me to pick out whatever I wanted, and pick I did! I ordered 2 kahlua, 2 roasted raspberry, 2 rose, 2 chai (which had edible shiny gold stuff on it!!) and 4 salted caramel truffles.  Then we picked out two desserts, a tiramisu (with a large white chocolate flower on top) and a flourless chocolate cake.  They also had a great variety of cookies and other little desserts.  They had many other flavors and delights and I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for greatness.  And I really dig the fact that it's a local business.  The Bakers Daughter actually is the bakers daughter, btw.  This place shares a wall with Karl's bakery owned by the truffle master's parents.

Ok, so I have seen Groupons for this place for quite some time now, so I decided to give in and see what it was all about.  We were greeted by a super friendly host who was quick to help us to our table.  Our server was helpful with the menu, though her pre-bussing skills could use some help.  She brought us their complimentary chips and salsa (salsa was pretty hot but had good flavor) and I really enjoyed the chips.  Got some freshly made guac to go with the chips, as my mouth couldn't take anymore spice...was good but had a lot of black pepper in it. So, their menu has several different taco options which you can pick and choose (two different tacos or two of the same, rice and beans) or you can get it as a burrito.  My girlfriend and I both decided to get the vegetarian burrito, which were very good, but very filling!   The place had a great vibe and I will definitely keep them in mind next time I want a burrito!

Stopped in for lunch with a friend the other day and I can't believe I didn't check this place out sooner.  I remember when this location used to be a Wendy's while it still has some Wendy's-esque features, they gave it a very nice look:)  I ordered the Thai Lemonade (Thai iced tea with lemonade) and gulped it down in five seconds, it was super delicious.  For food I ordered the CoCo Soup (coconut milk soup) with no meat sub extra veggies and a side of rice.  It was so flavorful, and the soup was just was I was looking for!  My friend was equally pleased with his garlic shrimp dish and side salad.  I can't wait to hit this joint up again when I'm in the mood of tasty Thai cuisine!

I dig this place for sure.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese flatbread is (in the words of Fergie Ferg) tastay tastayyyy.  They have a decent selection of beers, my favorite is the Left Hand milk stout.  As far as food goes, they have a little of everything: Deviled eggs with truffle oil for a starter, caprese salad, house made soups, flatbreads, burger, chicken sandwich, grilled cheese, steak, etc.  I have heard complaints about the service, but I have never had a bad experience here.  Kim, the bartender is super sweet, and Casey and Dillon (servers) are rad and accommodating.  Thanks guys!

What a cute little vintage shop! I can't believe I haven't stopped in sooner. The owner was a nice gal and she had a lot of great stuff packed in the space, such as: mens clothing and accessories (cuff links, tie claps, and the like), womens clothing, jewelry, hats, purses, glasses, and broaches to name a few. I will definitely be back for my vintage fill in the future!

I'd heard a lot of talk about FilmBar, so why did it take me so long to actually check it out? I'll never know.  Came here the other night to check out the Bettie Page documentary.  We arrived early and bellied up to the bar.  They have a nice selection of (mostly) craft beers and some nice wines by glass and bottle.  They have candies and popcorn for very reasonable prices, especially compared to the big theaters around town.  The bartenders were super chill dudes and I really liked the space.  There are tables around the bar with comfy seats and if you venture off around the place, there are more little spots to park your buns while you wait for the movie.  Unisex bathrooms=major thumbs up.    The theater itself was small and cozy.  I think there were about three rows of seats and it was totally great to bring my beer in with me.    A great place for a date night or if you just want to experience a little something different from the usual movie going experience.

My girlfriend and I went on a double-date here with some friends last week.  My first impression was that the place was cute and I liked what they did with the space.  We were greeted by a friendly hostess and the overall feel was great.  The food is a different story:(  We started with the onion straws app which was decent.  I ordered the mac and cheese that came with a petit salad, my girlfriend ordered a tofu dish, and our friends ordered a steak special and a sandwich.  The steak which was ordered well (I know, I cringed, too) came out rare, the vinaigrette on my salad tasted rotten, the mac and cheese was middle of the road...I've had better and worse.  My girlfriend enjoyed her tofu and our friend said her sandwich was pretty good.  My green tea adult lemonade was fantastic!  The best part of my meal for sure!  When we ordered dessert I chose the creme brulee.  I sunk my spoon in and it just dripped off...ew!!! Creme brulee is supposed to be a custard-like consistency...it was definitely not set.  I was super bummed.  I would go back, because I totally believe in second chances...but with so many good restaurants out there...they better step it up!!

So, the little lady and I decided to try this new place out yesterday.  It took a little while to be greeted, but it wasn't a huge deal.  They have tasty cocktails with fresh ingredients. I suggest the No.11, made with Plymouth gin and freshly muddled blackberries, or the No.89 with organic pear nectar, pear vodka and ginger.  Oh, and the best part is that they are 5 bucks (includes wine and pitchers of beer I think) until 5pm, 7 days a week.  Weee!  We started with the fondue, which was pretty delish (we asked for no meat, so we we give extra apples and big soft pretzels).  For entrees, I had the veggie stack, which was fantastic, with a side of mac and cheese and my girl had a soup and salad combo and a side of their roasted local veggies.  The staff was friendly and kept our drinks full and our table cleared.  I will definitely be going back:)   P.S. Even their valet guys are super nice!

I have only stopped in this little gem a few times, but each time has been a great experience.  I usually order a hot orange rooibos tea and a brown butter scone.  The space is small and cute, they have a fair selection of breakfast and lunch items, coffee/espresso and tea, fresh squeezed orange juice, and the staff and owner are always very friendly and helpful.  Me gusta!

My partner and I were both in serious need of new specs.  While in P.V. mall last week, we walked past Eyestop and decided to check it out.  Very glad we did, because not only was the customer service top notch, but the prices were unbeatable!   We bought three pairs of glasses, each with the special non-glare coating, one eye exam + eye dilation and it cost $400.  I consider that a very good deal, since I usually have to spend several hundred for one pair.    Even though they are in the mall, they are independently owned, and that is always a plus!  Oh, and our glasses were done in, wait for it...30 minutes!!! How awesome is that?  Louis was super nice and helpful, ask for him if you go!

Ok, so I have stopped in twice now, and both times were quite nice.  The first time I just had a scoop of their Madagasgar vanilla ice cream with some salted caramel on top.  It was  good, but the caramel was SUPER salty...a bit too much.  The second time, I had a scoop of vanilla (I know, so adventurous) with their fudge. Good God was is nom-worthy.  I even went back to ask for more fudge, prepared to pay for my extra topping and the chick behind the counter said it was on the house.  Thought that was pretty cool. Love this place and their staff...will be here again in the near future...and maybe next time I'll try something in a pretzel cone!

So, we received at $20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try.  Let's just say...it's been some months since then and we haven't been back...the only time this place has popped up on my radar was when a co-worker was talking about their lackluster experience, too.  The service was fine.  It was the food that got me.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and my girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada's.  Now, I expected cheese...but I didn't think I was going to have to go on a search mission to locate the tortillas. My girlfriend was equally displeased with her meal. The sangria I ordered was the only saving grace...not good enough to return, though...

Ugh, like many women, I too detest bra shopping.  Or so I thought.  I read some rave reviews about this place and thought I'd give  it a whirl, seeing as how I absolutely do not shop at Victoria's Secret and I don't have a lot of other options for my size. I was immediately greeted by Mary even though she was busy, she was with me shortly.  I told her that I hadn't been fitted in a very long time and that I was probably not wearing the right bra size.  She asked if I had some time to spare, as the fittings take about half and hour.  First, she had me fill out a little Q&A deal asking me what I wanted from a bra, what I didn't like about my current bras, and so on.  After, she showed me around the store a bit and pointed out that they also sell underwear, swimsuits and other sexy things.  When we were in the dressing room, she was very helpful and informative, all while maintaining the highest level of professionalism.  She showed me some of the flaws of my current bra and then showed me a bra that actually fit me, and holy crap! What a difference!  I will be honest here, cause that's just how I roll.  I went in there thinking I was a 36 DD, but in all realness, I am 32 G.  That really astounded me, this whole time I've been buying bras that were way too big in the band and too small in the cup...how could I not have known?!  She brought in a TON of bras for me to try on, which NEVER happens to me...I usually consider myself lucky if I can find one.  There were a lot of really pretty embroidered ones, lots of different colors and she even brought in a few sports bras, too. After trying them on, she came back to chat with me about how to properly take care of the bras, how many days in a row you can wear the bra without compromising the elastic, and she also said that they will alter their bras for you free of charge!  The price is a bit high, but you have to consider the small investment you're making in yourself.  It's totally worth it to have a bra that fits right, looks great and is super comfortable.  Thanks ladies, I'll be seeing you soon!

I had to stop going to my acupuncturist a while ago due to financial issues.  However, I found a pamphlet for Phoenix Community and saw they worked on a sliding scale ($15-$35), and decided to give them a whirl.    It's a nice little place, very calm and quiet.  I was greeted by the front desk dude and sat to fill out my paperwork.  He showed me back to the area, where I was informed of how they roll (since it's community style).    They have a large room set up with recliners and you just pick out which one you want to relax in.  Mayo came over and we had a short chat and she helped me recline.    She got to work, and she was quick!  I barely felt a thing..I was impressed:)    It's great to find a place that understands the importance of taking care of oneself, but not costing an arm and a leg.  I already have my next appointment available and I can't wait to feel the results!

I don't understand why this gym doesn't have more stars.  Look, this is a no frills gym...that's why it cost ten dollars a month!  I love it here!  Everything is always super clean and well maintained.  There are plenty of each machine so that, even during peak hours, you get your sweat on the way you desire.    The front desk people are nice and I don't care that they clean around me while I work out.  They're just trying to keep the place presentable.  I mean, someone is cleaning EVERY SINGLE time I go, and I go a lot!  I'd much rather be in a gym like that than one where stuff is dirty.  Duh.  I find that there is a good mix of people here.  There are definitely the roided out meat head dudes, but there are tons of average folks like myself just trying to stay fit.  I guess I'm trying to say that I don't ever feel awkward or self conscious when I'm here.    From the windows to the walls.

So, I was a little hesitant to try this place.  One, because of the name and two because I just thought it was meat burgers.  That all changed when one of my coworkers told me they had a ridiculous veggie burger.    The veggie burger comes with honey mustard, cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, onion and tomato.  I added pickles to mine, cause I love them.  They have a lovely little condiment bar, packed full with items like: jalapenos, pepperoncinis, ketchup, malt  vinegar, A1 sauce and more!  I may or may have used any and all of those items:) The little woman indulged in one of their chocolate milkshakes, which was ok, but I prefer shakes made with chocolate ice cream and not syrup.  The food is pretty cheap and the register gals are very bubbly.    The only downside is that the closer you get to the bathroom, the more it smells like stinkin' sewage. Bleh.   Oh, right! They also have beef burgers (duh) and grilled chicken sandwiches and things of that nature for you meat lovin' folks.

Fun place, tasty custard and excellent customer service.  Both times I have been, Keith has been behind the counter.  He is very informative and was kind enough to let me try a few flavors before deciding on my vanilla custard with hot fudge.    Will definitely be back:)

Look, I've said it before and I'll say it again: bra shopping is the worst! Well, at least for gals like me who need to buy bras in larger sizes. Usually we get dealt the fugly card and get to choose from one maybe two styles.  Upon entering this lovely establishment, I was greeted by the SUPER helpful Ariel. I told her of my bra woes and she began picking out tons of bras for me to try on. She started me out with about 6-7 and as I tried them on she brought in another 5 or so. They had tons of cute styles and an array of colors. The bands go down to a 28 and cup sizes up to K, so you're probably going to be able to find something that suits your bod. They have sports bras, undies, nighties and more.  And to top it off, their prices are outstanding!  Usually, my bras cost around $120+ each! I was able to find my size for as low as $45!!  I ended up purchasing 5 bras, weeeee!!! Oh yeah, for every $200 you spend, you get $10 back in store credit!   Ariel's help was top notch, the selection was impressive and I will most definitely be back!

Where do I begin?  This place is AMAZING!  I have been many times, and each time I try a new dessert and am always pleased.  They have tsoynami's (think vegan Blizzard), an assortment of vegan/gluten-free pastries, coffee/espresso/non-coffee beverages, and more!  My recent quest to live a life full of plant based foods has landed me here many times, as they offer soy, rice, almond, coconut, and hazelnut milks for my caffeinated bevvy of choice.  They have, by far, the BEST vegan desserts I've tried thus far.  Let me just say, if you're into things like moist chocolate cake, ooey gooey frosted cinnamon rolls, and super delicious doughnuts, this is the place for you.  The staff is always nice and friendly, and they are usually dancing and/or singing, too.  Come on, why wouldn't you go here?!

Had to write an update since they now serve brunch on Sundays.  I went in and was slightly disappointed to see that just about everything was with tofu scramble (not the hugest tofu fan), but I made a selection: The Benedict Arnold.  Made up of roasted asparagus, Canadian "bacon", "hollandaise", and scrambled tofu.  You can get it in a bowl (for the gluten-free kids), or wrapped in a tortilla.  I chose the tortilla, cause well...I love a damn good burrito!    It came out, and I was ready.  First bite in, and I knew we had a winner!  The combination of all flavors was perfection to my taste buds.  They have a decent selection to choose from, including: cinnamon rolls, yogurt parfaits, other burrito or bowl delights, coffees and juices, and more.  It was a nice brunch experience and hope to come back for more.

So, I have recently decided to try my hand at veganism.  I always enjoyed hitting up the Scottsdale location of Green, but was overjoyed to hear that they had opened one minutes away from my house.  I really love that it's not typical (from my experiences) vegan food, i.e. some bowl of veggies with rice or noodles or a salad. In addition to having a completely vegan menu, they also have gluten-free items.  I love their wings, which I thought were made of seitan, but much to my delight, they are actually a mix of soy and mushroom stems! The sauce is to die for, with it's green onions and chunks of garlicy goodness.  I almost always order the Green Burger, made of grains with veganaise, tomatoes, greens, pickles, ketchup and choice of side (thyme fries, fruit, curried pasta salad, or tahini coleslaw).  Lately, however, I have been venturing out and I got the Secret BBQ Chicken Sandwich (comes with bell peppers and onions) the other day.  Now, I've never been a big fan of bbq sauce, but their espresso bbq sauce is freaking delicious! And today, I ordered the Original "G" Po-Boy (mock chicken with their wing sauce, tomatoes, veganaise, and greens) which was spicy and just what I was looking for.  Their bevvies are pretty tasty, too.  I usually go for a nice glass of Sweet Lime or the Organical Berry Lemonade.

Sadly, I think the last time I dined here was my last.  I always feel gross after ingesting items off of their soy-filled menu. So, I tried a salad and was utterly disappointed.  When it comes down to it, I'd rather spend my money on real food, not fake meat and fake cheese and fake this and that.    Keep it real...er...well, you just keep it.

The little lady and I were on a buffet kick for a hot second, and this was one of our stops.  While they did have a large array of food to choose from, I did feel a little skeeved out.  For starters, almost every plate I grabbed was still dirty, with dried chunks of the previous diners selection still hanging on.  Second, a lot of the items looked as though they had been sitting for a good long while...and lastly, I was bummed that every time I went to get some soup the bowls were totally out. Some of the food had good flavor, and it wasn't all bad...but when I'm paying for food I want the good stuff.  As for the service, the dude was prompt to clear our dirty plates and fill our drinks.  Probably won't return.

Local businesses abound here at Central Farmers Market.  They have multiple local farms (Horny Toad, Paradise, one I can't remember the name of and Pinnacle) showing off their seasonal goods.  In addition to leafy greens and other organic fare, the market also has booths for bread (bought two loaves, a multi-grain sourdough and a fiber one...both equally delicious), butters and cheeses, healthy animal treats, a knife sharpener, kale chips (raw/vegan delights!!), food trucks, house plants, cake-pops, pickled items, tamales, grass-fed beef, and much more.  I thoroughly enjoy this small market each time I visit. I definitely recommend hitting up Horny Toad farm and chatting up Brent, he's super nice and helpful and he informed me of their sweet deal!  Basically you give them one hundred bucks and they allow you to come to their booth five different times to pick out veggies (I believe he said around 8 or 9) of your choosing! It's a little sweeter than having a bag dropped off with items you don't like or don't use.

This place literally just opened.  I didn't really know what to expect, but when I walked in the doors I was immediately greeted by Nick, and he was very nice and down to earth.  This is a shop for people who like to garden/grow plants hydroponically or in the ground. They have all kinds of gardening supplies and Nick said they will be receiving their seed shipment from Seeds of Change any day now.  I will definitely be back, as my green thumb (or lack thereof) has been sparked:)  P.S. I was informed that the in the next issue of the New Times, Grotown will have an add to clip out and bring in to save 20% !!Yay plants:)

One night, I was futzing around on Yelp and came across this new place.  There were a lot of good reviews, so I went out the next day on a mission to try this place and review it, too!  While the location is great (across the way from SideBar), the parking kind of sucks, but I found a spot eventually (it was also lunch time on a weekday, so that's probably my bad).  I met a friend there, and we were eager to see what all the hype was about.    Basically, everyone is right!  It's like Chipotle or Subway, but with sushi!  What a great concept!!!  You can choose white or brown rice with either soy skin (which I thought sounded effing gross) or the traditional seaweed (way better!) and then you can pick three veggies (anything additional is 50 cents more) and you can add meat(s) for a little extra, too.  I opted for the seaweed with brown rice and added avocado, cukes, sprouts and asparagus to it.  It was quite a nice little green roll, if I do say so myself (and I do).  They take the roll and put it in this nifty roll cutter, and out comes 10 perfectly cut sushi pieces.  Then as you move closer to the register, they ask if you'd like any toppings (crispy tempura, roe, sesame seeds, etc.)  They have all kinds of sauces: ponzu, soy, teriyaki glaze, sweet chili, sriracha, eel, and maybe more that I can't remember. You can also grab a bowl of miso soup or some edamame just in case you want a little something extra.  When I went to pay, my rolls were only about 4 dollars plus my drink= 6 dollar meal.  Woo!  When you go to the condiment bar, it's full of ginger and wasabi and two big iced tea pitchers and then two more that are full of ponzu and soy sauce.  It was awesome and I was in condiment heaven!!  I grabbed some of the hibiscus tea and was ready to go.  The roll was soo delicious and the tea was surprisingly good.  I went back for more, and grabbed a roll to go for my woman and a cucumber salad (they also have a squid salad and a seaweed salad).  All in all, my expectations were met and then some and my friend really enjoyed her meal, as well.  The food was great, the staff was friendly and helpful (they saw the look on my face as I walked up and totally knew I didn't know what I was doing), they explained how everything worked and made my experience that much better.  Can't wait to come back!

So, the little woman and I decided that we wanted to start a container garden...you know, be a little more sustainable and such.  One of her teachers told her about this new nursery, so we had to give it a whirl.  And what a great discovery!!  They only sell edible plants but also carry seeds, soil, pots and some fruit trees, too.  They offer classes (they have an indoor and outdoor classroom) and the staff is super helpful.  So far, we've purchased several basil plants, heirloom garlic, pickling cucumbers and a large bag of soil (the soil is from a local purveyor and it's organic AND is very reasonably priced at $9).  The heirloom garlic were $2.99 each and the pickling cukes were somewhere around 3 or 4 bucks for six plants, and the pot I got for the garlic was only two dollars.  Not too shabby.  Right now they have tons of different tomato plants (not huge, but bigger than seedlings), squashes, cucumbers, heirloom onions, several types of garlic, eggplant, and so on. On my last visit there, not only did I grab some plants, but I was also informed of how different plants grow well together and the gal behind the counter came around and helped me pick stuff out and answered all of my many questions.  They are only open on the weekends, so I'll have to wait a bit to get my next fix.  I highly recommend this place!  Their selection is nice and the price is a steal!

This cute little neighborhood breakfast/lunch spot just opened up, and is the sister restaurant to Tuck Shop.  The menu is small with super reasonable prices!!  Not much in the way of vegan fare, but I managed to find a tasty dish: The Red Flannel Hash (beet, potato and root vegetable hash sans eggs).  It was very tasty and had a nice amount of black pepper in it.  I also ordered a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for a grand total $8 and change.  Not too shabby for brekky.    My dining cohorts ordered a frittata topped with sour cream and chives, a Portuguese doughnut and biscuits stuffed with some kind of meat (I forget the name of this dish) and were equally pleased with their meal.  Not sure about parking, as we walked over (so awesome!) from their house.  This is a quaint little gem with indoor and outdoor seating.  They also have booze, so you can add a little pizazz to your wake up call.    Great place, can't wait to come back!

Two stars.  Because, I really have had better.    A group of my foodie friends and I met up here in order to sort out the deets of our upcoming podcast.  The dude who made our reservation made it for four instead of five, so it took us a little while to get a table.  Not that big of a deal to me, especially since said dude bought a bottle of wine for the group to share.    At long last we were taken to our table.  Our group nestled in to our cozy booth and perused the menu.  I already knew there wasn't much for me to eat there, as I had checked their menu online.  My cohorts ordered some appetizers: tater tots and deviled eggs.  Both dishes looked good, and everyone seemed pleased.  The service began to get a little shotty at this point. It took a while to get waters to the table and there weren't any napkins or silverware at the table until we asked for some (after the appetizers were delivered).  Two of my friends ordered appetizer salads/soups which didn't come until the entrees came.  Salad friend ordered with no walnuts, he is allergic, but it came full o' nuts. Soup friend was presented soup and no spoon.  Soup friend also ordered several items and was told that they were out (which I can understand, given that there was a Suns game that night), when plates were dropped at the table servers were VERY quick to disappear, leaving us to literally have to yell after them for the missing stuff/refills.   As for my meal, I ordered the Citrus Marinated Olives and the Chicory Salad.  I let the server know of my vegan/gluten-freeness and he was helpful and accommodating.  The others seemed divided on their meals.  Lots of meat, that's all I can remember of what they had haha.  Eventually, the manager came to the table to apologize for all of the little mishaps and said a round of drinks was on the house. Fine by me, I thoroughly enjoyed my Tito's gimlet, thank you!  Then the executive Chef came out to apologize as well.  It was a nice touch.  All in all, I might give them a second try, but with all of the great places out there, Blue Hound might want to step up their game.

What a great first-time experience!!  I was perusing the Groupon Now deals, and came across one for a facial (have been wanting one forevs!) at Gigi's. Yesss!    I got there and called because I didn't know exactly which building it was in, and when I finally found my way, Alicia was standing outside to greet me.  How nice:)  Alicia was super nice and very professional.  After I filled out my little questionnaire, she took me to my room, and gave me my robe to change in to.  She came back a few moments later, and the greatness began.  I told her that I had sensitive skin, so she used an all natural botantical line.  She washed my face first, and then exfoliated, applied a papaya enzyme to help with dead skin, used a papaya mask for more awesomeness, gave me a face and neck massage, massaged my arms and hands, checked me under the super bright/magnified light, used the high frequency on some problem spots, hot toweled my face and moisturized me! I was in heaven!!!  I was inquiring about some of their other services, like the detoxifying body wrap and body polish.  She was very informative and they sounded great, so I asked if we had time to do one and she totally made it happen.  I ended up doing one with mud, so we headed to another room.  I undressed and got on the table and she came in and brushed my skin, oiled/massaged me and then covered me in mud.  While we waited for it to dry, she gave me a scalp and foot massage and ended with moisturizer.   Whew, that was a mouthful.  Seriously though, it was an incredible experience and the prices were SUPER reasonable!  I will definitely will be back, and I highly recommend this little gem to anyone in need of some self care and r&r.

Joined some of my peeps here for dinner the other night.  I hadn't heard of this joint yet, so I had no idea what to expect.  I was the first to arrive, and was greeted in a timely fashion.  I was slightly put off at first, because each time the server came to the table to take drink orders, she appeared to be on her phone.  Oh, that's gonna go on Yelp for sure! But, I figured out that that's how they take down orders there (I confirmed this with her) so no points off for that!    So, their menu has entree sized portions, but they encourage doing the smaller plates and sharing (i.e. Asian tapas).  Unfortch, all of my dining cohorts were meat eaters and I wasn't super hungry, so I just ordered the Green Papaya salad with crispy tofu.  The salad was delish and was dressed in a spicy citrus vinaigrette.  My friends ordered all kinds of stuff, including: Chicken Lollipops, Sugar Cane Pork (like a mini kebab but on a piece of sugar cane), BBQ Short Ribs, which everyone agreed was one of their least favorites, Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Truffle Edamame, and much more.  Some of the folks enjoyed some adult drinks, one was called Blue Winter.  It was a martini with house-infused loganberry vodka and blue curacao and a sugared rim.  Another friend had the White Sin made of frou frou stuff.  For desserts, they ordered the Green Tea Cheesecake (which came garnished with some pink sauce that tasted like some kind of childhood bubblegum flavored medicine) and dessert wontons.  Two of the diners ordered an after dinner drink made with white and dark chocolate Godiva liqueur and Frangelico (except the didn't have that so they used Kahlua instead).  The decor was pretty sexy: white walls, red curtains, sexually charged artwork, blue lights.  I felt like getting it on as soon as I walked in the door.  Kudos.  All in all, we had a great time and enjoyed the food, drinks and service quite nicely.    I will definitely be back!

First time here the other night, and it will definitely not be the last!    The vibe is cool and I kind of felt that if I were a dude, I would have needed a gnarly beard or fancy mustache.  Tons of beers!!  Huge line of taps with numbers, so you are forced to read the large chalkboard above.  It was a little much for my brain, so I just asked the server to pick a tasty stout or porter for me.    I was pleased to see a decent amount of veg-friendly options (veggie pizza, veggieloaf sandwich, daily special with a veg option, grilled cheese).  I opted for the grilled cheese (I know...I like cheese sometimes, don't hate.) that came with pesto and tomatoes, fries and a side of house-made roasted tomato ketchup.  It was all divine. M'lady had the vegetable pizza, which came topped with lots of seasonal veggies (watermelon radishes, squash, fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, onions, and more).  It was equally as pleasing to the palate.  Our friends ordered the special, fish tacos.  Came with two tacos filled with fish and fried calamari and toppings, rice and beans.  Spicy, but very good and flavorful.  Back to the beers for a moment:  I only ordered the single bevvy, but our friends ordered a flight (any six beers of their choosing) and it came in a cute little muffin pan:)  Kudos all around from the decor to the food!  These folks know what their doing and I like it, I really like it!!

I really dig this Upward Projects restaurant the most; probably due to my affinity for tasty beers.  Anyhow, they have great drink selections (besides beer) including wine and house made wine coolers.  Some of the wine cooler flavors I have tried include: grapefruit ginger, raspberry lavender, and blackberry rosemary.  All of which were good, but I liked the blackberry rosemary the best.  I usually order the castlevtrano olives as a little snack and a Great Little Salad.  I have only tried the Brussles Sprout pizza (cause I'm trying not to eat wheat, get off my back!) which comes with manchego cheese, lemon, roasted garlic and pancetta (I got mine without meat). It is perfection! The texture of the crust is perfect, with a nice little crunch around the edge (thanks MJ).  I recently tried the Garganelli pasta dish, which took much difficulty to not wolf it down.  It was so good (even though I think I overdosed on gluten), it came with: broccolini, pine nuts, oven roasted tomatoes, red pepper, pecorino all tossed in a lemon basil pesto.  One word: nomtastic.    The decor is rad and the people serving it up are, too.  If you haven't checked out Federal, get your buns down there ASAP!  Cheers!

I WISSSSHHHH I could remember the name of the dude who helped me the other day, because I'd love to give him props! (Brown hair, beard, very nice...ring a bell?)    Anyway, I was in need of food for the little whiskered fur babies, and I stopped in here after work.  I was thrilled to see that they had so many choices to offer.  We try to eat as well as possible, which means so do our kids. True, this store is not big like a PetSmart, but  they have a lot of brands available, including ones for just about every allergy a pet can have.  They have raw foods, limited ingredient foods, canned/bagged/frozen foods.  You name it, they probably have it.  Anyhow, the guy that was helping me answered all of my many questions with ease.  He was knowledgeable on ingredients, how long companies had been open, which companies have had to re-call their products (and which ones haven't), and so on.    I felt very comfortable purchasing from this store and I would definitely do it again.  They have a great refund policy: if your pet doesn't like the food return it and they will donate it to an animal shelter!  I love it!  I was even given some free samples for our pooch, which he loved.    Thanks for your great selection and customer service!

Ever since I saw a poetry performance across the way from this joint I had been wanting to get in and try it out.  The first time I stopped in, I was greeted and told to grab a seat wherever.  I looked over the menu and was pleased to see that everything was either vegan or vegetarian (depending on if you wanted eggs or tofu).  I usually opt for the biscuits and gravy when I have breakfast.  The gravy is vegan and not thickened with flour so if you want it on top of something gluten-free, like potatoes, you're good to go.  It's not just any old gravy, no no, it has corn and roasted poblano chiles in it.  I like to get the rosemary potatoes as my side, but they have others to choose from.  I usually grab a cup of joe, which they serve with regular cream, almond or soy milk.  On my most recent trip, I finally came in for lunch.  Excellent, because I  had been thinking about the barbacoa jackfruit and nopales sammich for a gooooood while.  Basically, jackfruit is a fruit (duh) that has a meaty texture and is very good at absorbing favors.  So, the jackfruit is slightly spicy and is topped with grilled nopales (cactus) and vegan mayo.  I will admit, that while it was tasty, it wasn't as good as I had hoped.  Also, on this particular trip, my server took my order and then never came back...it was a little odd.  Getting a coffee refill can be a chore sometimes, unless Chela (Chayla? Cheyla?) is working, cause she's awesome.  I haven't tried any of their homemade pies/cakes yet, but I'm sure I will soon.  All of the baked goods are vegan...so it's inevitable.

Finally!! A little Bink for the rest of us!  My good friend, and fellow Yelper, Shay V. and I decided to head on down for some tasty dinner.  We were greeted upon entering and after a moment we were seated in the dining room.  First off, beautiful photographs of fruits and vegetables lined the walls (along with a photo or two of some McClendon's doing what they do best).  The room was bright and fresh, but not too ritzy.  Good thing, cause I wasn't exactly dressed to the nines.  Anyway,  we were each given a menu with apps/entrees/desserts, then another with all of their local vegetable side dishes/salads, and one for the booze *weee!*  We started with a carafe of the Arizona Stronghold Tazi (one of my faves!), a lovely blend of: sauvignon blanc, chenin blanc, malvasia and riesling.    For food starters, I ordered the Citrus Salad (assorted citrus wedges, toasted hazelnuts, watercress, honey drizzle) and my cohort had the Foie Gras Beignets and the Sweetbread Nuggets.  I loved the salad, and I thought he was going to die from pure food ecstasy ...there was more food to be had, though.  For the main course, I ordered the beets (roasted baby beets, hibiscus-lime vinaigrette, jalapenos, wild rice and cilantro) and the kale (kale, lemon, walnuts sans cheese), and my friend ordered the Duck.  I really loved the beets, the kale was ok and Shay V. almost died from food excitement.  I ordered a Gimlet to accompany my veggies, and was delighted when it came out topped with liquid nitrogen (think bubbling, foggy cauldron).  Next up, dessert!  We both ordered the Frozen Soup (tangelo sorbet, tangelo sauce, blueberries, mint, liquid nitrogen and mine sans meringue).  It was so freaking good! It was hard not to inhale it, however, I have a propensity to get freeze headaches...so that helped.  It was a great dining experience, and the servers/kitchen were SUPER accommodating with my food restrictions.  We moved to the bar for a few more libations, and Chef Binkley came out to chat with us.  I was swooning, as I have a big fat Chef crush on him.  He asked us if we wanted to try some new shooters he had, of course we said yes!  Friend had the rum with mango "bomb"  at the bottom and a nutmeg rim, and I had one with tequila and some limey business in it.  You basically take the shot and when the ball of juice hits, bite it and it explodes with tasty splendor.    Let's review: great local wine/beverage selections, beautifully plated local food, exciting presentation of drinks and dessert, excellent service at the bar.  If this doesn't make you want to go there, I don't know what will!

Just stopped in this morning for some breakfast, and I have to say that Aaron and his team have truly outdone themselves!  I used to shop here when it was the little grocery store, and the way they redid the space is SEXY!  I just love all the space and brightness, the brick walls and the wood elements.    I got a tour of the kitchen, which is huge!  The rotisserie (while I don't eat the birds) is sweet, and it gives the cafe a really delicious smell. You have the option of going up to the counter and ordering or they have a full service coffee bar. They also serve up beers and wine on tap for the full "bar" experience.  Breakfast is served from 7am-3pm and lunch/dinner is served from 11am-10pm.  For brekkie, I had the Chickpea Pancakes!!! They were very good, topped with roasted pecans, bananas and agave.  I paired that with a nice cup of Cartel coffee and chowed the eff down.    In addition to the food and drinks, they also have a little section of wares in the middle of the cafe.  I saw some great stuff (books, soaps, wine bottles turned into drinking glasses, bow ties, etc.)  I like how they have incorporated little bits of St. Francis to their menu, including: the baguettes, the rice bowl and the Del Real sandwich.  The menu has lots of rustic/farm-to-table/fresh items on there, and I can't wait to come back all of the time!!  They just opened recently, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting your backsides down as soon as possible, because they are sure to blow up soon.

On a whim, I purchased an Amazon Local deal for a Petit Facial from April.  I don't consider myself a super girly girl, but I figured a facial isn't anything crazy...just trying to look a little less dry? (I mean, come on, this desert!)    First, her space is very calm and relaxing.  April is genuinely friendly and super nice.  When I had my first appointment with her, she was very informative (letting me know what she was using, what was in it, why she was doing it, and so on).  She put it to me straight in telling me that for my age, my skin could look better.  She listened to my concerns (I have super sensitive skin) and I felt comfortable with the products she used.    After three visits, I can already see a huge difference in my skin! More hydrated and less congested skin? Yes please!  I HIGHLY recommend taking a little time for yourself and making an appointment asap!

Thank the universe that Whole Foods finally opened close enough to me that I can enjoy their treats on the regular.  I used to hit up the Paradise Valley location and I have to say, I dig this one more for several reasons.    First off, let's talk about their lunch options.  They have the usual pizza stuff, a sandwich area, Asian food items (hot and sushi items), and the Wokeria.  I'm a huge fan of the Wokeria because I can get a healthy and filling lunch for six bucks.  Basically you get a bowl and fill it to your hearts content with all the veggies they have out, you pick a sauce (Asian fajita, Coconut curry mole or a tomatillo based sauce), you pick your starch (brown rice, white rice, cilantro lime rice or soba noodles) and then they wok it up for you.  If you want meats (steak, chicken, faux meat or one other I can't recall...maybe pork?) they'll cost you two dollars extra each.    They have a great juice bar that greets you as you walk in, a smoothie/coffee bar and they even have a bar in the back.  What?! Yeah, I said it.   All of the employees are super rad and helpful (and most of them are super hot...let's be real here).    I've always been a fan of their local goods, and the newest addition to the Whole Foods family doesn't disappoint.

I LOVE this place.  I've stopped in many times, and it's always great!  First off, it's small and chill.  The walls are chalkboards, with all of their beer and wine selections listed for patrons to check out.  They have happy hour until 8pm, yes please.  They have tons of fun little games around the bar to play, including Cards Against Humanity.  The owners are great people, super down to earth...they play great tunes (which they usually are dancing to behind the bar).    They have a great beer selection (try Shake Chocolate Porter!!), which I swoon over every time I stop in.  They have a decent wine list and a few swine eats (hot dogs, ham and cheese sammich and a meat and cheese board).  It's the perfect neighborhood bar, no frills and laid back enough that anyone can just roll in.  My co-workers and I stop in pretty regularly, and my most favorite time was Valentine's night where they had condoms on the bar for people to take.     The Whining Pig: where people can drink and get it on responsibly.

This is one of my favorite breakfast places lately.  I would say "new favorites", but I think I've been coming here long enough that it isn't new to me anymore.    First off, this is an all vegan joint and their grub is organic. They have tons of different oatmeal mixes and offer several ways to enjoy: hot or cold cereal, thick magic (mixed with vegan yogurt or applesauce), slippery magic (mixed with warm coconut oil), and my personal favorite PANCAKES!!  I usually get the peanut butter chocolate chip mix, but once I got the Protein Powerhouse and the Love Potion cakes.  They are served with some fruit, vegan butter and grade B maple syrup.  In addition to breakfast items, they also have a nice array of "burgers" all made with a base of their original oatmeal mix.  They have some tasty beverages, as well! Most often I get a large Jnantik (a slightly bitter tea made from a Mayan seed, super good for your bod) one of their two coffee alternatives but they also have smoothies, pour over coffee, frozen hot chocolate and teas.    This place is cute and cozy and the people who work here are supremely awesome.  Genuinely nice, not that fake nice you might encounter elsewhere.    Ooooh! I almost forgot!  Should you find a mix that particularly tickles your taste buds, they have small and large bags for sale! Woot.  Get yer buns over and try, you'll thank me later.

So glad this place finally opened!  I had been wanting pizza for a good month, and I remembered they were open late night.    It's a cute little space with a rad mural inside.  They offer cheese or pepperoni by the slice $3 and $3.50, and they have whole pies as well (12'' for $12 and 18'' for $18 plus more if you want to add toppings) and they always have some kind of delicious special going (which is only available by the pie, just an fyi).  I don't think this place is pricey, especially considering all of the fancy pizza places that popped up.  This place is a no bull pizza joint, and the fact that they are open from 8pm-4am Tuesday-Saturday is an added bonus!  I think this place is PERFECT for a late night snack after an evening of barhopping with friends or for restaurant workers (who usually get out too late to enjoy anything other than something berto's or Denny's). They don't deliver just yet, but are fully planning on doing so:)   When I stopped in, I ordered two slices of cheese.  The crust is thinner, but not super crunchy like thin crust.  It has a nice little crunch with a pillowy texture inside.  Good sauce, good cheese made by good peeps.  My friends decided to join me, so I ordered a slice of pepperoni and they ordered pepperoni with mushrooms and jalapenos.  No one was disappointed and we all have been talking about it since we dined there last week!  Lastly, the crew is great! Nice and friendly, playing great tunes and having a good time making pizza and chatting with customers.  Can't wait to go back!

Ok, so I know I fell off the review wagon a bit, but I'm back and ready to spew...I mean, you get what I mean.  So, a pal of mine invited to me to a spin class here and my initial thoughts were "ew, spin people are culty." I know, call me Judge Judy.  Anyhow, I decided to give it another go and I'm really glad I did.  This place is great! The people are all super nice, it is nice and clean and I get a really amazing workout! It's my new favorite Saturday morning ritual.  The bikes have little computers on them to show you your RPM's, watts, duration and trip length.  There's a simple lever to add or remove resistance and the instructor is always up there super pumped and ready to sweat it up with us.  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to incorporate something new into the ole workout routine!

Greg and his crew have, once again, outdone themselves!   As if I didn't love The Whining Pig enough, they had to go and make an equally awesome second bar!    This place is more spacious than it's older sister, which is nice for bigger groups of people.  Candy and games adorn the bar, so you can munch on some chocolates while you chat and drink.  I highly recommend the Shake Chocolate Porter, just an FYI.  Amazing selection of bottled/canned/draft beers, wines and snacks.  And if that's not enough to get you going, they also have old school nintendo and sega games at their high top tables for folks to enjoy.  The staff is awesome and I can't wait to hit this place up again!

I have given ole SoBo a few tries and unfortunately they haven't really given me a reason to return.  The food is good, don't get me wrong...but it's the service that I just can't get down with.    The last time I was there kind of sealed the deal, here let me paint you the picture:  Three of us in our party, we walked in and got a booth right away as there were only a few other tables being occupied.  It was a weird time of day, so I didn't think much of it.  We were greeted by a nice little server girl full of hickies on her neck, but then again maybe she just forgot how to vacuum or she and her pet leech had a disagreement.  We ordered drinks and those came out pretty quickly, then it was time to order food.  One guy ordered a pizza, the other guy ordered a sandwich and I ordered a turkey burger, which I was asked how I wanted it cooked.  Um, what? For turkey? Girl, that always gets cooked well done.  I ordered it with a side salad with their vinaigrette and added avocado to it.  So, the food was taking a while and our server came over to apologize saying "sorry guys, it'll be out soon we just got like 50 million tickets in!"  Hmmm...for the three other tables in here?   Then the pizza arrived.  Yep, just the pizza...the sandwich and my burger arrived about ten minutes later.  My burger lacked the avocado I asked for, and the side of "dressing" that came with my salad was actually just a solo cup of oil...I thought maybe all of the vinegar and herbs might be at the bottom but when I poured it all out, it was just oil.    Sorry Social Box, it's you not me.

New spot that I have been chomping at the bit to try!  I absolutely love Bragg's, so it's no surprise that I am already in love with The Coronado.  Liam and Emily have done it again, folks!    Super cute decor, lots of little spots to sit in and outside.  They have locally roasted coffee from Xanadu (which I'm currently sipping on and loving), tasty house-made pastries (I got a vegan cherry chocolate scone...and then I got one more for the road, sooooo good!), breakfast and lunch items, beer and rootbeer on tap, house cocktails, etc.  This place has something for everyone and I cannot wait to go back and try it all!!

Oh. My. Damn!  I effing love this place!  I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service.  The oysters are a must have app, with a little squeeze of lime and a dash of salt...my mouth is watering now!  The little woman and I both usually get one of their cocktails (shrimp, octopus, squid, snail) served with chips and some avocado. The shrimp ceviche is another favorite, nice and limey. The last few times, however, my gal ordered fish.  I believe it was cooked in garlic and butter and came with rice and beans and it was phenomenal!  Sometimes they have live mariachi music, which just adds to the greatness!
