What happened?! I went here a few times and it was impeccable. It was a next level eating experience.   But recently I've gone and it was worse than Olive Garden. I wish I knew what happened and why but this seems like a classic case of saving costs and cutting corners. I hope it gets back to normal soon. Otherwise I doubt it's worth a trip.

Amazing sushi. They even have a I hate sushi menu for those with issues eating raw fish. Their service has been great each time. One Friday night was slow but never had that problem a second time. Their rolls are fresh and delicious. I love this place and go whenever I want to treat myself.

This place is pretty nice. They have good beer and most importantly they have kilt lifter on tap! Bonus points. The food is good but not great but we have been there a few times when the food was superb.     This place is dog friendly which his really cool. But keep that in mind if you have an allergy or what not.

Best Chinese I've had in the qc. Really large portions and very nice people. Call ahead for larger groups if your worried about having the big banquet tables open.   Really considering having my next d&d session here.

The hours kind of suck but with the personal and amazingly awesome care you get... Who cares?  Everyone is amazing Alice, Lexi, et al. They are wonderful and nice. My family and I go mostly after church on Sunday and it's such a treat to look forward to. Their chicken fried steak is amazing as is the taco salad. Another good mention is the burritos they are massive and always delightful make sure to order them smothered.

Just fantastic. Great pizza and good atmosphere. I really wish they would deliver but then again they aren't very far either.   Pretty much all of their deep-dish or. Utter crusts are worth it. I've not tried their thin pizzas yet.
