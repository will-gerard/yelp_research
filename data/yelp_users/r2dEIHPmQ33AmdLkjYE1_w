As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read "Good Food Takes Time" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our "good food" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.

This is my local coffee shop but not just for the coffee. They make great cup cakes & the breakfast is simple but awesome. Plus they have free wifi!  Small town meets big city with a laid back family feel very cool.

I had a great time from the minute I walked in the door the live music was outstanding and there were salsa dancers how cool.  I feltlike I was transported by the food. Duck tacos with a spicey tomato sauce. I loved my entr√©e carnitas and served with warm handmade tortillas what a treat. My wife loved the sangria margaritas as did I. Our server mentioned that all the ingredients were fresh and boy could you tell by the flavor.  We can't wait to go back.

Staff was very helpful and the homemade marsh mellows were the perfectly paired with the handmade ice cream.

We have now been here twice and the food is really good. It has a small family owned feel to it.  The baked apple pancake thing  and vanilka ice cream is worth it.
