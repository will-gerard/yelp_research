Crooks. He stole my dyson dc 07 animal and gave me a DC14. When I complained about the $50 fee without my approval he bullied me that there would be no charge. No wonder! He stole my vacuum for parts!!!!!

This neighborhood bar is getting better! Great new food menu and friendly service ALWAYS. If only they played better music more consistently. :) kinda hit and miss music. Lots of good TV's for sports as well. We have made friends with lots of the regulars so it's very neighborly. Compared to the food at Zipps -- NO CONTEST! Try the bacon plate appetizer with Lagunitas Daytime beer. Mmm life is good!
