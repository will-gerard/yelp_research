We pulled up just after the store closed and were standing in the parking lot looking up another auto parts place when a guy named Bruce came out and apologized for being closed.  When we explained that we needed a battery for the Jeep and we were looking up another parts place to buy one, Bruce went inside and opened up the store e to sell us a battery.  Then to top it off, he got tools and helped us install it.  Talk about customer service!

Some of the best Mexican food in the valley.  Everything is good, the food, the service and the atmosphere.  The food is delivered quickly and I often leave there amazed at how little time I've actually spent there yet have never felt rushed by anyone.  Love, the salsa, some of my other favorites are  the pollo especial,  steak picado and the rolled quesadilla.

Ordered a couple of basic rockers, owner told me they would be ready next week.  When I asked if they were open on Saturday, he said if I couldn't get there during the week he could meet me there on Saturday. Wish all businesses had such a customer focused attitude.

This is a real find and I mean "find"  because it is tucked away on the side streets of downtown Glendale. This small little restaurant is unique in decor and cuisine, not many polish restaurants around.  The food is flavorful and fresh, the soups are unique and tasty.  The stuffed bell peppers are awesome as is the stew.The owners are warm and inviting without being overbearing.    My only disappointment is the limited hours, I work too far away to get there for lunch and they are only open a few nights a week.  Definitely worth the trip.

This has to be one of the best kept secrets in Glendale.   Tacos are wonderful,  tortillas are hand made, salsa is flavorsome and hot.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside is yummy Mexican goodness.

After my old favorite nail salon changed owners the service was not up to the standards of the previous owners.  I dreaded the thought of trying salon after salon until I found the right one.  The nail goddess smiled on me and I found this place on my first try and have felt no need to look further. The ladies who run this salon are lovely skilled and knowledgeable.  Each time I have come here I have felt welcomed and appreciated as a customer and not just another pair of hands.  If you live in the area I would definitely check it out.

I try to avoid this particular store unless I can run in and get what I need and go through the self check out.  The lines are always incredibly long, the customer service is nonexistent and there is a general attitude of apathy.  Shelves in the grocery section often have gaping holes.

Last time we were in Wickenberg we decided to bypass some of the usual eateries downtown and found El Ranchero.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I had the beef, ham and chicken quesadilla which was yummy.  The salsa and bean dip were excellent.    Definitely a place to visit again.

Stopped by just to check them out earlier this week.  This is a family owned business, not one of the megadealers.  The staff was friendly and helpful and there was several dozen bikes on the showroom floor.

This location has good food, however, unless you plan to spend the entire evening waiting, ordering, eating and paying for dinner you might want to go someplace else.  The interior seating area is VERY loud, making it difficult to hold a decent conversation, outside seating is much better.  We've been there twice in the last month and both times the service has been extremely slow.  When you spend more time waiting to place your order, waiting for your food or waiting for the check then it took to eat the meal, well, there is a problem.

These guys rock!  In an industry where women are so often ignored, they see us as riders first and foremost.  If they don't have what you want, they will order it, often with no obligation to buy it even if you don't like it.  Customer service at its best.

After a huge disappointment a few weeks ago at another nail salon, Queen's was a breath of fresh air.  The staff was attentive, polite and their work was well done.  I had a pedicure, fill and eyebrow wax it was a very relaxing experience.  After my pedicure, the technician gave me a neck and upper back massage - that was a first.  Definitely my new place to go.

I've been going to Queen Nails and Spa for 3 years and I've always been happy with the results.  Yesterday was my first visit since the new owners have taken full control.  All of the old staff is gone, including Son who is the waxing specialist.    The technician who did my pedicure was adequate.  The pedicure process is considerably shorter than before, leaving out the lower leg massage which is really something I look forward to.  It may be an option that you pay more for now but in the past it was included.  The entire process just seemed to be lacking some of the nicer touches provided previously.  The waxing was also adequate.  The technician seemed inexperienced.  However the end result was adequate but did not have the polished technique and results previously provided by Son.  My fill definitely left something to be desired.  I actually didn't realize how much until this morning when I looked closely at my nails.  I'm used to getting A-1 results so I've never paid too much attention in the past.  I knew that the technician had rubbed  the area right under my nails raw in a couple places while filing my nails.  Careless on his part but, it happens.  However, this morning as I look at my nails, not only are the nails on my right hand significantly shorter than my left (he even checked them!)  but three of the nails on my left hand lean to the right..  Unfortunately I don't have time to go back and have them redone because I'm leaving on vacation.  When I return I'll give them another try but with a different nail technician.  I will also be sure to check my nails continuously throughout the process.  If there isn't significant improvement I'm afraid I will need to find some place else.

Great little place in downtown Glendale.  Nice service and atmosphere.  A little different take on the menu, it list the type of sandwiches, then you decide if you want chicken or a burger on it.  Yummy sandwiches.  Another hidden jewel in Glendale.

When you don't feel like a full restaurant and you want more than the normal Mexican fast food, Chipolte fits the bill.  The food is always fresh, the service is fast and it's affordable.  Don't know why that Scott guy says the building is a re-purposed chain drug store building.  I don't remember what was there before but it was never a drugstore.  And who cares what else is in the building?  You're there for the food.
