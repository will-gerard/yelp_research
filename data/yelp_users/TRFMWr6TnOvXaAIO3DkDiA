I work right by this location and I've always been pleased with the service. But today I called to order lunch, on my very short lunch break. They asked me to hold briefly and I agreed. After 5 minutes (no exaggeration, I checked the call time on my phone) they finally picked the phone back up. Even then I was still patient and ready to order. So I tell them again that I'll be placing an order for pick up, and they ask me to hold again. So I let them know I had already waited 5 minutes to order, and he still pushed to have me hold AGAIN. When I only have 30 minutes for lunch and I'll still have to wait another 10-15 for them to make my food, I don't have time to hold over and over. Needless to say, I've crossed them off of the list of places for lunch in the area.

Love love love this location! Always fast and friendly with my pick up orders. They've never gotten my order wrong or forgotten anything. One of the top places on my list for lunch when I'm at the waterfront!!
