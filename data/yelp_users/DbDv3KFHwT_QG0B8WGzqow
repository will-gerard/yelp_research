I have been a member for 14 years.  My savings account was inactive for 3 years so they decided to withdraw my money and give it to the Arizona Department of Revenue as Unclaimed Property.  It will take me 4 to 5 months to get my money back, plus they charged me a $15 fee.  WOW!!!  and thanks for the courtesy call!!!!  I talked to the manager and she just said sorry. I will never bank there again.  So bad!!
