I love Federico's on 32nd.  Easy jump from Scottsdale open 24 hours a day.  I usually stick to the steak, egg, and cheese Burrito.  It's is large and under $5.  The drive thru is quick except for lunch time and 2 A.M.  The Enchiladas and Tacos are great and the combo plate is a lot of food.  The rice is good but the beans leave something to be desired, I like a creamy refried bean myself.  These are not that good.

Ahhhhh Ted's............  Ted's is my second favorite Hot Dog joint.  My order has not changed in the 6 years I have been going there.  Two reg dogs, one with chili mustard, and onions the other with hot sauce, mustard, and onions.  an order of onion rings and a chocolate shake round it all out.  It tastes the same every time (delicious) and you can't beat the price or ambiance.  I love when you're sandwiched between a couple in their 70's and a family with small kids, everyone just enjoying Americana.  Ted's does it right, enjoy!

O.K.  I made a visit albeit still skeptical.  I absolutely must point out first and foremost that anyone who views this as a good destination for anything related to New England OR Seafood is one of three things.  1. Owners of the restaurant 2. never had good seafood before 3. never had good seafood before  The clam chowder is a pasty concoction that does not begin with bacon/salt pork, has bits of chewy rubbery clams, is tasteless, and overall would recieve a boost with the addition of a couple of cans of Snow's.  The fried clams were horrible.  The only plus was that they were not strips.  They were actually "Bellied" clams but I use that term VERY loosely.  Price will always determine the quality when it comes to clams.  they cost a certain amount of money and there is no way to get around that.(unless of course youre not using Ipswich Clams)  There is no way that these are from Ipswich Shellfish Co.  The batter is terrible as well.  Why would anyone choose to fry a clam in anything but an evaporated milk/corn flour dredge??  Any new englander who has had a good chowder from legal, Sole, etc. or a clam from the clam box, essex, or Ronnies knows that this place is not your fried clam destination.  Wait!  i almost forgot.  the tarter sauce was horrible as well.  Can i give zero stars??

I love the Chuckbox.  Juan, great tasty burgers, great ASU Co-Eds, condiment bar, onion rings, etc etc etc.  I have never had a bad experience there.  When working off of Priest a few years back, a group of us would go weekly.  Can't miss.

Sushi Eye is my #1 choice for maki sushi in PHX.  The Rolls are large and reasonably priced under $15 with most in the $10 range.  I get mostly take out to the tune of 5 times a month.   On to the Sushi, a normal order is Booty Tem which is a tempura fried Booty Booty Roll.  The ASU which is a shrimp tempura roll topped with Spicy Tuna and Jalepenos.  The spicy tuna is the best I have ever had.  The Las Vegas Roll is good as well.  These are 3 of my favorites but i have tried all of the rolls and they are fantastic.  I stick strictly to the rolls.  The fish is always a 4 out of 5 scale.    You will not go wrong with Sushi Eye to fill your Maki Sushi craving.
