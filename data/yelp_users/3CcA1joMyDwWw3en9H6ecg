I love this place!  it's a cultural experience!  I think even if you are Mexican, this place delights all the senses!  I love the tortilla department!  36 freshly made yellow corn tortillas for $2.50!!!   the ladies at the meat dept were fantastic!  The wall of spices, herbs, and chilis was incredible.  I did not have enough time to sit and eat there but that's the plan for the next trip.  I came home and made shredded beef tacos with all the fixings.  My rec is come and linger and enjoy the sights and then have a great lunch either at the food court or at the restaurant next door.

Some friends of mine have this thing called Fat Fridays!  It's the beginning of a debauched weekend when the diets, workouts, no drinking stops on a dime and are thrown out onto the curb!  So we went to Red Lobster for Fat Friday!  I haven't been to a Red Lobster in like years, so I was kinda tentative about eating here, but the company I knew would be fun so why not!  Yup, indeed, the company was fun.  As far as the food goes...the menu has changed a lot and for the better!  It still has signature Red Lobster fare like all the fried sea food you can think of, served with potatoes cooked in any way imaginable.  But they also had sensible dinners pared with nutritious sides!  I was amazed.  This made for a long time deciding what to get, but I was hungry and had the focus of a lioness on a hunt!  I dictated to the table that we have the lobster pizza for starters!  no one complained out loud but I feel the daggers come out of your eyes! hahaha  I ordered a special dinner called the Hawaiian Isles...four coconut shrimps, salmon with a pineapple teriyaki type sauce, comes with salad, rice, and fries!  Yeah...it's Fat Friday! I also had a Mango Mai Tai that was dangerously delicious! It was gone in a sec...almost got brain freeze.  Our server was the most gracious and attentive server I have had in a chain restaurant, she was wonderful!  My rec...try out Red Lobster again, the food has improved, just be prepared for the lackluster crowd.

Shhhh! I go here for the $1.99 Blue Bell ice cream.  hahaha...but seriously, they have the best produce at the best price!  I really miss a lot of fruit choices being in AZ, but this place takes me home a bit with fresh CA white peaches, Haas avocados, kiwis and good tasty cherries, unlike the ones that taste like water from Fry's.  I have managed to spend $25 a week for groceries, feeding two people two meals a day for a week!!! Yeah!  that is amazing economics!  I get a lot of things from the bulk aisle which comes out to like $1 for bag of couscous or black beans or legumes or chocolate raisins!  They also have a great vitamin/supplement dept for probiotics, plant enzymes, soluble fibre supplements and other digestive aids.  I don't think this place is hippie-dippie at all, less so than Whole Foods.  Although, I would go to Whole Foods for cheese and wine and for the cornichons.  My rec is go here first to get basics then Sprouts or Whole Foods for the "special" things.

I love Charlie's for its sincerity!  the first time I went there, I came early to get some line dancing lessons in.  Learned a wonderful dance, and got several drinks.  It was a good night!  It has become a Thursday night thing now, not that regularly but frequent enough.  I am still amazed and awed by the two-steppers and line dancers!  There are some fantastic dancers who go to Charlie's and can be slightly intimidating.  I am not a very big fan of country western music so I have to reserve a star.  My rec is go early on a Thursday night, two for one drinks, and learn a line dance.  You can meet lots of men on the floor that way.

Hi...I am Rico and I am an ice creamaholic!  This place is danger, danger, and danger!  Well, for me anyways, when a gram of sweet, creamy, frozen treat enters my body, 10 pounds are generated!  So I go here on metered visits, like an addict visiting a Swiss methodone clinic.  I go and binge and have my fix!  I love all the ice cream combos...orange sherbet and chocolate, cherry ice cream and vanilla, peanut butter and chocolate!  ahhhhgggg, how can I make just one, just one decision!  So in my desperation, like this place will be taken away from me, I always go for the super chocolate and peanut butter 7 scooper!  okay...not that big, but the 2 scoop sundaes are that big given different metrics.  Anyhoo...  my rec is to go if you have a calcium deficiency, go and reward yourself for waking up on time, go when you are having a bad day, go if you are having a good day, go when you don't know where to eat, go after you eat at your favorite place, go after sex, go before sex...just go!

I have been here twice and not my choice.  I don't have any reason why this would be on my list of choices for sushi.  It's loud, obnoxious crowd, and way too expensive!

Okay...i was with a bunch of ASU students on a Friday night.  For not liking the uni crowd...i had tons of fun this time!  Our server had the timing of a Swiss watch, up to the second accurate as to when the next round had to be ordered, and never skipped a beat!  I drank 10 London pubs worth of gin and tonics and had a happy buzz going.  I was kinda hoping that this crazy guy sitting with us was gonna start shit cuz I was feeling good and numb I could've gone a full 10 rounds with him, but I maintained and circulated instead.  I am giving Casey Moore's another star for our stellar server!  If the management reads this I hope that they believe in merit raises and employee rewards and utilize these incentives.  My rec stands...unless you are going with a gregarious group who can handle a lot of alcohol.

Ay ay ay ay!  This place has so many crazy rules!  Two are listed below...  1. can't usually accommodate big parties unless the party has 25 people or more and then the banquet room can be used.  For a party of 18, this was a bit frustrating but we were there for a birthday party and wasn't going to stress about it.  2.  When you order a pitcher of margarita, you can only have four glasses.  So for six, you have to order two pitchers! not a bad rule, I guess, but is there a need for this rule at all?  I was forewarned that the food is especially spicy.  I can attest with minor burns on my tongue from the salsa as evidence.  I am sensitive to spicy food but was really intent on trying the house specialty, adovada, which is as spicy as the salsa.  I ordered chimichanga with beef adovada a la carte, since I was full from chips and spicy salsa and two pitchers of margarita!  I also asked for a side salad but they don't serve side salad, so the server offered to add extra lettuce garnish on the plate.  My chimichanga was plated on a platter with tons of shredded iceberg lettuce surrounding it.  WOW for the lettuce garnish.  Was it prescience, common sense, or clairvoyance that made me order a pile of lettuce with my meal?  Whatever the impetus for this action, it was a smart move as the adovada was on the salty side, packed with spicy heat!  If you take the salt away, it would just be spicy.  If you take the spice away, it would just be salty.  Chili peppers do have a flavor to them, and I like it when that tartness, or bitter-sour flavor comes through, and the spice envelopes it in texture.  The spiciness was so poignant that it numbed my tongue a bit, unable to taste, and which could explain why it was salted the way it was.  The additional sides of the lettuce, sour cream, and guacamole really rounded out the chimi, and I ended up enjoying my meal.  the third pitcher of margarita could have helped reach the level of enjoyment.  Los Dos Molinos seems to be a favorite place but for reasons of which I am not certain.  I liked my meal, but was not spectacular, the prices were not so good that I would come back for cheap eats, the location was too far to add to my rotation...  My rec, is to go with three other people, (four total) who like the adrenaline rush of super spicy salsa.

I love places like Restaurant Mexico!  First of all, the food is amazing!  they have a lighter hand when it comes to the use of flavor conducting fats, not greasy at all!  I have eaten here twice now and it's always great!  the portions are actually people sized not gorilla or elephant size.  You leave feeling full and satisfied without the guilt of gluttony.  I ordered a carne asada taco dinner which was just what I wanted.  It hit the spot.  The tortillas were grilled and had a good toast on them but still soft and chewy.  The carne asada was well seasoned without masking the taste of beef.  The beans were excellent as well as the rice.  I love the horchata but I could have it less sweet.  The second time, i just had the carne asada dinner!  If you are hungry for beef but not need a full on 8 oz of meat...this is the meal!  My rec is to go and enjoy your favorite Mexican meal!

I finally went here for lunch and it was fantastic.  I was kind of lost upon entering because it was like a small grocery store, but I did read reviews and have heard from friends of the layout so I expected it, and went to the back of the store where the kitchen was.  There is a board with the daily special.  You take a slip and write down what you want to order and then hand it over to the kitchen staff.  I had a mango shake that was so gorgeous.  it wasn't super frozen, you can taste some yogurt in it, and it was naturally sweet from the fruit.  The samosa came next.  It was served with a tamarind chutney that was just amazing sweet and tart and spicy.  I was pretty much done after the shake and the samosa, but my lunch was yet to come.  It was a plate of pilou, pickles, bread, yogurt, and a bowl of yellow lentils.  It was so filling!  the textures of each of the items complemented each other, and the tastes mingled in your mouth so well.  I ordered two more samosas to take away with me!  My rec is to go with friends and create your own buffet lunch at your table by ordering a variety of curries, lentils, soups, and breads. Don't forget the mango shake!

Okay...my past experiences with Farmer's Market completely overshadows my opinion about the downtown Phoenix Public Market.  The context; I used to work at an organic orchard in the central valley of CA that sold 43 varieties of peaches and grew acres of fresh basil, oregano, thyme, rosemary.  After the orchard, I moved to the Bay Area where there is a farmer's market everyday.  I am giving the Phoenix Public market a harsh two stars for all the reasons given by previous yelpers.  Yeah...the items are expensive even after chipping in for the organic, local, small business factors.  The quality is not consistent.  I bought two heads of garlic, half of one was dried out and unusable, the other, sprouting...the same goes for the onions.    I liked the scone that I bought from the bakery stand.  the scone had a sandy texture and was moist and fresh.  I haven't been back in a while and will probably give it another or several chances...the only way it will get better is to support it and encourage it...  My rec is to go early on SAT, have a scone and coffee and people watch in between reading articles from your favorite weekend paper.

I love malls!  Grew up going to malls.  Come from the place of Mega- Super- malls!  Okay...it's a mall, there's no real big whoop about it!  But if you are hanging out with friends who want an urban indoor hike...this is the place to go...the terrain is hard to navigate as they have many a paths to take...the micro habitats were fun and interesting to visits...the watering hole aka food court was enjoyable and they have my favorite hot dog on a stick...really who doesn't like meat on a stick breaded and deep fried!  Spent most of the time in Macy's but did manage to go around most of the mall.  We opted to feed ourselves silly at the Cheesecake factory...and people wonder why Americans are so fat! I'll review this in depth at another time.  So for a shopping fix...Chandler Fashion Center satisfies.  My rec...never venture alone in a mall...always bring your friends who can give you a critical eye but won't buy the same things as you!

I love this place but my waistline cannot afford frequent visits!    I love boba drinks in all forms and sizes!  My favorite is a mango smoothie with lychee jelly.  The small is enough for me...once I got the largest size and I swear I was ill from carb poisoning! hee hee  The last time I went, I had taro with boba and it was so good I wanted the large!  but no...i stuck with the small.  i reserve a star because they don't have spicy popcorn chicken!  It's the ultimate companion for boba!  My rec is go and be creative for a fruity, chewy, icy treat!

I was going to Solo almost everyday for two weeks!  Free wi-fi...i can walk there, and it's nice and chill.  I needed to get a lot of reading done and being at home wasn't doing it, so I went to my nearest cafe.  I had an iced coffee the first time and they had a liquid sweetner they added. The next few times I had iced tea that they can customize and brew per order!  I love that!  My rec is to go and have tea and blend your own elixir.

I am breaking a personal rule and reviewing this after the first visit!  My housemates and I went and we ate half of the items listed on the menu, so it was like visiting several times.  We had imperial rolls for starters. Lemongrass soy beef noodles, papaya salad, hotpot, stuffed tomatoes.  Fresh Mint special lemonades for our drink.  Then we finished with mango tapioca and banana fritters.  After a debauched weekend, I thought this might be a good place to get back on track and eat a healthy, nice vegetarian meal.  As you can tell from what we ordered, the debauchery continued!  The imperial rolls were amazing for not having any meat in it!  No loss of flavor whatsoever.  I did notice a difference in texture, but it wasn't bothersome.    The papaya salad had to be one of the best dishes we ordered.  It had the right amount of crunch on the fruit.  The dressing was also well balanced and was not too spicy with chili, or salty with fish sauce or sour with lemon, and just the hint of sweetness.  The addition of Thai basil gave it a refreshing finish.  Just wondering though, if they used fish sauce at all...being vegetarian...hmmm.  My next favorite has to be the hotpot.  A super hot ceramic bowl filled with sizzling brown rice and vegetables with a sauce that just imparts flavor without being obnoxiously present.  The vegetables were not overcooked, the rice was starting to crust at the bottom and the sauce brought it all together.  You have to go and taste for yourself. It's really good.  At our visit, Fresh Mint was staffed by a father-daughter team, with daughter at the back of the house.  Dad, as the server, was friendly and inviting, and paid just the right amount of attention to us.  My rec is to go with friends who don't mind sharing, and order tons of food.
