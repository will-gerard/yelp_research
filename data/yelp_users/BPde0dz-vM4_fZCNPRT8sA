All I can say is yuck. I expect a lot from chain/franchises. Maybe the food won't be the highest quality, but the service and cleanliness should be right on. And it should be fast. I went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time. The last time I went, I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out. I got home and started eating it and, would you believe it, it tasted like cigarettes!! Clearly, whoever made it had just been smoking, came back inside, and made my food without washing their hands!!!! Respulsive, I didn't even bother to go back to complain. I will never give Einsteins my business again. Looking through Yelp, I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins. You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration. We may not be official food critics, but we do know what is going on.

Yayy! This place is awesome! I just moved to the area and I'm excited to find a new coffee shop and take advantage of their WiFi. The coffee is great and the people are friendly, I don't see what more a person could want from a coffee shop! Oh yeah, and Pita Jungle is in the same plaza! It's like I moved to my personal little heaven.  They open at 5 am which is great for me, seeing as how I get up before the damn sun rises for work. The one thing I could suggest Coffee Rush, contract me to do your pastries  (I know where those muffins are from)!

House of Tricks is a great place for dinner if you're looking to go out for a special occasion. It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two.   I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me.   We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy.   Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.

Oh how I love Pita Jungle.   I go here often - this location and the Arcadia one. I have tried a few things, but I have a tendency to pick favorites and not stray from them. I LOVE the Spinach Pasta Salad (which I add chicken to). The Jalapeno Cilantro Hummus is sooo yummy.   To be honest, everything else I have tried hasn't really done it for me. I had the Lemon Chicken Artichoke Pasta Salad the other night and I just wasn't feeling it. The falaffel is good - but nothing compared to Pita House. My date got the salmon - he said it was really good.   The servers are always, well, entertaining. I feel the urge to go spend my latest paycheck at American Apparel before going in for dinner. You know, the whole 'unattractive on purpose' thing. Can't say it's a trend that I've ever been into.   The Scottsdale, Tempe, and Arcadia locations all fit the same mold. Trendy, nice little spots. However, I went to the Mesa one the other day and it just seemed a bit off. The set up is weird: seating is on one side and the bar is off in space in the opposite corner. I asked the bartender how business had been - she told me not so great.

I heart Rome's Pizza!! Being a native New Yorker, I have struggled over the past two years to find anything remotely close to NY style pizza. I had tried many local, independent places, but no one got it right.    When I moved back to Scottsdale about 6 months ago my guy and I passed this place driving down McDowell road. I figured we could try it out (I'm always on the look out for some yummy pizza). Don't be taken back by the empty parking lot and shabby exterior, after all, isn't it what's inside that counts??    The food is always fresh. The Greek salad is great - it comes in small and large. The pizza is amazing (as long as you know what you're getting - NY style). I know that it's family owned, which I always have an appreciation for.    The man that owns it does most of the deliveries. When I first moved to the area I called for delivery and he had to call me because he couldn't find my street. Embarrassingly, I only knew the street I lived on and not much more, so I couldn't help him. He told me that it was okay and eventually found the house.  I expected him to get out of the car and give me a huge attitude, thinking I'm an idiot because I didn't know where I lived (could you really blame him?). But he was as sweet as could be and told me it was no problem. How refreshing!   In a nutshell, hoooorray for Rome's!!

You know, I really wanted to like this place. My boyfriend and I have driven by many times, but never had a chance to stop in until today.  When we walked in there was a gentleman (possibly the owner??) sitting at the host stand doing a crossword - he stopped promptly and seated us.   The atmosphere was cute, we sat outside on the patio and looked over the paper menu while we waiting for our server (you think they could afford to at least laminate the things). When our server came I asked about the Over Easy Ice (basically an iced coffee with sweetened condensed milk and spices) and he pretty much had no clue what I was talking about - he didn't know the menu at all.  We started with the raz cranberry scone with vanilla bean creme freche. It came to the table drizzled in honey and had a huge mound of the cheese on it. As soon as I took a bite I was dissapointed. The scone was stale, like, second day stale. What a bummer, especially because it totally had the potential to be really amazing.  I ordered the mushroom scallion cheese omelette. It was something you would find a Denny's for a lot less. Greasy, greasy, greasy. My boyfriend got the smoked salmon with asparagus - he liked it. His meal was pretty much the only good thing on the table. He got the sourdough toast, which came dry without any butter - not even on the side. It was left untouched on the table.  What a let down. With their hip signage and atmosphere, this place could be so much better than it is.  And for heaven's sake - use fresh scones!!!

This place is awesome!!   The prices are totally reasonable; all sushi is 50% off all of the time. So I think an avocado roll ends up being around $2.50 (which I still love as a former vegetarian) but the fancier rolls (like to Tootsie Roll) only go up to like $6.00. The pieces are a good size too, I've been to a lot of sushi places that have great prices then you get the sushi and it's a total disappointment. It's definitely not like that here. And it's great because with their prices as cheap as they are, we got to choose a whole bunch of rolls and our bill was only like $30.  They also have this dish called Bonsai Noodles, you can choose what kind of meat you want in it (we chose seafood), how spicy you want it, and what kind of noodles you want in it. It was AMAZING - and hearty like a gumbo. And the portion is gigantic. We had so much left over!   The penny beers are pretty sweet, too!  The only reason I'd take a point off is that the service is a little slow. Not that we're not willing to wait. And for some strange reason, every time I go they get my drink order wrong. One time I ordered a diet coke and got a Dr. Pepper. Another time I ordered an Arnold Palmer and got a Green Tea. No big deal, but a little odd.  Anyway, Orient Sushi rocks. I just hope with their prices like they are they can afford to stick around!!

I love Jamba Juice. I can't afford to pay $5.00 for breakfast everyday, but when I can I come here. I love the Banana Berry Smoothie and (I don't remember what it's called) it's a concoction of strawberries, bananas, peanut butter, and granola.   Juan is working everytime I go in. He's always friendly, fast, and helpful. That kind of consistency is what keeps me going back to this Jamba, I have like 4 others to choose from between my house and work, but I continue to go here!
