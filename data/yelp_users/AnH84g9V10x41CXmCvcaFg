I have to go with a solid 4 stars on this one because even if the food is not spicy enough for you, there are so many other reasons to love it.  The atmosphere is great.  I like everything from the tables and booths to the patio.  It is easy to hang out and have a good meal with friends, or to tuck yourself away in a corner...  The service has always been top notch for me.  I have been there when I was in a hurry, and I was able to eat and run without having to beg for service.  I also have had long leisurely dinners and was always happy with the attentive, but not pushy service.  I LOVE their pad thai.  It's a little different from the other places I have gone, in a good way.  I'm only sorry they have had such a time with the construction outside their door.  a nice place doesn't deserve that hassle.

I'll write more later... at this moment, I just want to add that Paisley Violin also has FREE WIFI in addition to all the other wonderful things that other reviewers have said.

*sigh   Another place that used to be the best in town, and is now an embarrassment.   Food off the Chinese menu is still good, but the regular menu is no longer up to snuff. Sauces that were once delicate and light are now weighted down with starch and made unbearable with sugar. I went with about 6 other people and the only dishes we enjoyed were some pan fried noodles, and some stir fried greens. I don't even know what the greens were... maybe snow pea leaves... but they were good. Still 2 out of the 10 dishes we ordered isn't a good record.

If you are at all bashful or have issues around nudity, you might want to stop reading now.  This place will not be for you.... but for the free spirited, the Alwun House is the place to be this month for their Erotic Art Festival.  The exhibit kicks off with their outrageous sneak preview party tonight, (Feb. 8th) at 7pm.  Don't expect to see stuffy art aficionados milling about with glasses of champagne. Do expect to see transvestites on 8 inch platform shoes dancing and laughing with the  glitter dusted, the body painted, the latex clad, and the goths. They create a club atmosphere in their back yard with a floor show of comics, cross dressers, dancers, acrobats and contortionists.  You can't immerse yourself in the circus atmosphere and not walk away smiling.

Landmark education is an educational dialog held in a workshop setting that often produces life changing results.  I don't want to sound like a commercial for their curriculum for living, but as adults, we all get stuck in the way we see and do things.... the Landmark Forum provides a dialog that can help people view things in a different way, thus getting them "unstuck."  The Landmark Forum takes place over three consecutive days and an evening session (generally Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday evening.) Each full day begins at 9:00 a.m. and typically ends at approximately 10:00* p.m. Breaks are approximately every 2-3 hours, with a 90-minute dinner break. The evening session generally runs from 7:00 p.m. to 10:15 p.m. (in certain locations, from 7:30 p.m. to 10:45 p.m.).  It is not cheap, but in my opinion, it is worth it. Landmark Education courses are accepted by most employers for CEU credit that is accepted by most professional organizations.  (think tax break AND pay enhancement)   There are additional courses and seminars offered at very low cost to support the learning from the Forum, but the forum is the way in the door.  I know a lot of people who attended Landmark, and whether they are actively attending classes now or not, all of them are glad they took the course.

If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.  Friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned.

I was quite surprised... wasn't expecting much. Instead of the mediocrity i expected i had a wonderful meal. The soba was great! I had a wonderful seared tuna, and the Tempura my friend ordered was perfect. I took home a couple of baked buns for lunch the next day which were among the best i have ever had.. very soft and fresh. You have to get there early to get those... they usually sell out before the afternoon is over.   It was a really nice surprise. I will look forward to going there again.

Having grown up in a city with a large traditional Italian neighborhood, full of large traditional Italian restaurants, the first thing I tried to find in Phoenix was a good plate of tortellini and a decent piece of Veal Genovese.  I found them at Christos.  The atmosphere at Christos is very traditional... white tablecloth, stemware, cloth napkin and flower centerpieces.  It feels special when you come here for a meal, but the meal is very reasonably priced.  The menu is traditional, with dishes like Pasta Primavera, Linguine with Clam Sauce, Chicken or Veal Saltimbucca, Canneloni, Chicken, eggplant or Veal Parmigiana.  They have Cioppino, decent salads and a good wine list.  What more could you ask for?

I am NOT a fan of Karsh's. When i moved to Phoenix many years ago, everyone made a fuss about getting their baked goods from Karsh's. I was really looking forward to what i expected would be wonderful baked things. They weren't. They were tasteless... Everything is the same tasteless flavor. There is pink iced tasteless, white iced tasteless... they have mastered the use of food color.... but it doesn't overcome the tastelessness. The only thing Karsh's has going for them is that they are a Kosher Bakery. I suppose that gives them a "captive" audience. There will always be a community of people who cannot buy their things anywhere else because they require Kosher goods.   There is one exception at Karsh's. They make a wicked fine Challah. Everything else leaves me flat.

I cannot believe that I never wrote a review for Scott's Generations!  I must stop here once every couple weeks or so.  It would be more often if I was in the neighborhood more...  The have the BEST chopped liver in town.    I'm not a big knish fan, but one of my friends is.  She drives from Surprise just to get one.  I'm a huge fan of the Reuben sandwiches.  I stop for lunch, but I never go home without a pound of chopped liver, some delicious slaw, and (real chewy) bagels.  My only beef with this place is that they close early.  I can never get here in time for dinner.

Finding a pair of shoes that fits is key in the running world.  These guys know their stuff.  I tried and tried, then i found runners den.  Yes, they are expensive, but it is all relative.  If they fit you in a pair of shoes and they don't work out, you can return them.  If you buy them at most other places, you can only return them if you haven't worn them off carpet.  I don't know about you, but i rarely run on carpet.  To me, that makes paying twice as much for one pair of shoes so much better than paying half for 4 pair that don't work.  They also have all the running clothes, gadgets, accessories and socks a runner could ever want.  Here are my faves: 1. Wright Sock- double layer cool max sock.  You will NEVER blister or even get a hot spot in these 2. Amphipod- tuck your keys and ID inside the band of your shorts.  No bouncing! it stays and you never have to worry.  I love it so much i used the large version to keep things handy and out of my pockets while travelling in pickpocket ridden areas 3. Flexitol heel balm- for cracked heels.  Nothing else works 4. a nike running shirt with a zip screen pocket for my number so i don't have to find pins all the time.  Looks good, doesn't tear the number

If you want to impress a date, take them to Marcellino's.  My first visit there was with a date, and I was definitely impressed.   Your dining experience there will be private, personal and in a lovely atmosphere.  As a diner, you will feel like everything is especially for you.... and it is. Marcellino makes sure that your meal is worth savoring and that you will appreciate your evening enough to return.

I wandered in this shop while killing time waiting for someone.  It was a very happy accident. They have killer frames.  I always see the same old stuff at every place I look.  Not so with this place.  They take risks... Big risks.  The result is a shop with the hottest styles around and at very reasonable (not cheap) prices.  The selection is hot.  Lots of places carry names like Maui Jim... they have a more interesting list along with a few expected choices.  Vendors include Harry Lary (Paris), Kyoto, Booth & Bruce England), Etnia (Barcelona), ProDesign (Denmark), Theo (Belgium) and others.  My faves this week are the frames by harry lary and by etnia.  The employees were very helpful, considering that i didn't get anything.  I suspect that they were not employees, probably the owner.   I will go back for a pair of glasses from them when i get my eye issues resolved (surgery).  Until then, I will just have to stop in once in a while to try on a few and add them to my wishlist.

Cave Creek between Cortez and Cactus is a great place for antique hounds.  There is a plaza filled with antique malls from one end to the other.  The largest of the shops is "Everything Goes." It occupies 3 storefronts on the south end of the plaza.  Like a lot of other shops, this one is a conglomeration of shop owned merchandise, and consignment which is arranged in little consignor areas and shelves.  This shop has the largest variety of quality merchandise, and most is at very good prices.  Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I took some.

This place knows coffee.... not that over roasted thin tasting stuff you get at that popular chain either.  They know the science of getting the best out of the bean.  The beans here are roasted on the premises, on Monday and Wednesday morning. In my opinion, the owner, is an artist in coffee roasting.  He keeps a delectable assortment of coffees at a very good price.... they also have pastries and light dining.  Plenty of parking.  Located on the southeast corner of Central and Dunlap.  The coffee is great, the seating is comfortable and the people are very nice.  They have added a website:  http://www.grinderscoffeeco.com/

Hmmmmm..... Chinese? I think not. If you are expecting a great meal, go elsewhere. Pei Wei is a good not so fast version of fast food. It isn't fine dining, but it certainly serves a purpose. I'll always pick Pei Wei over a fast food burger, and how anyone can go to Panda Express when this is a couple blocks away is beyond me. Pei Wei is also a bit overpriced for what it is.   For a long time before the airlines went insane over carry on, i used to bring a Pei Wei kids meal as my personal upgrade. It's small, well packed, and used to make the other passengers jealous.   I don't go to Pei Wei so much anymore. Long lines and inadequate service keep me from venturing in their door on any whim. I will order ahead and pick up. They rarely get my order right, but whatever i get usually tastes pretty good. I just never go with the expectation that I will get my correct order.

I have to say that the view here is EXCELLENT, the food is almost always wonderful... the inconsistancy is the service.  It is a great place to bring friends from out of town, or to bring your parents when they wonder why you live in Phoenix instead of wherever they live.

This was my "secret nail spot" for 2 years.... I went there and received good service.  My pedicure always looked nice and lasted a long time.  The scrub and massage was always decent.  I never had to make an appointment, and I never waited longer than 15 min.  Things started to change.  I noticed that my 15 min wait had become 30 or 40 min.  Last time she made me wait an hour and a half.  I only stayed to see how long it would really be instead of the 15 min she had told me.   The quality of the service also declined.  My polish stopped lasting as long, and it often looked sloppy.  She would try to charge me ridiculous amounts for the design on my big to that had always been free.  Needles to say, I have found a place that appreciates my regular business.  I won't be going back to Wendy.

Du Nails is a busy little shop in an easily accessible plaza.  The parking is adequate, and the location is good.  It's in the same plaza as Pei Wei, Sauce, and Safeway, so it is easy to run errands while waiting for your appointment... or to get your nails done before picking up carryout.  The shop has the ambiance of a garage. There is no attempt to decorate or provide comfort.  This is a place to get the job done as fast as possible, so don't expect to come out feeling relaxed or better about anything except being able to check another errand off your list.  The technicians do an adequate and totally impersonal job at applying and polishing acrylic nails.  They have Spa chairs for pedicures.  Their pedicures are better than the nail services, but the garagelike atmosphere really detracts from the experience.  The thing that struck me here is that they are geared to provide one kind of service.  They are good at applying a tip and covering it with acrylic.  If you want tips applied for a special event, or are happy with polish instead of a pink and white look, and do not need a lot of atmosphere, i would recommend them. They do not backfill well, and they do not want any client who requires more than their regularly allotted time to do nails.  The only person in the shop who does sculpts without tips is the owner, Du.... and he seems to prefer not maintaining clients.  I have sculpts instead of tips, and he did not want to do my nails after a couple of weeks because "it took too long."  I have 2 friends who tried his shop.  The first time they went to him.  When they returned to have their nails filled, he had another tech do the job and they were less than happy with the work.

Before REI had even considered opening in Phoenix, there was Arizona Hiking Shack. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. They are very good at fitting their customers with the right gear. They make every effort to be sure that you have what you need and are prepared for your hike, climb or backpacking event. They are also a great resource for local maps and information.

Thank goodness for Valley Self Storage.  I have tons of stuff crammed into lockers at their facility.  The place is cooled, so your heat sensitive things aren't completely destroyed.  I have never seen a spider or any kind of bug for that matter.  I'm sure they do regular pest control which is huge.... no one wants to open a box and find something that bites or stings has crawled in and made it home.  They are extremely nice.  If you are late, or something happens to your automatic payment (happened to me) they call and make sure you are aware.  I was very happy that they did.  It would have been upsetting if they just assumed I was flaking on my contract and sold my stuff like I have heard that other storage places have done.  I've been a customer there for about 6 years.  I'm very happy with them.

Gallaghers is a good neighborhood bar.  They have good drinks, passable food, Sports on TV, and a very friendly staff.  They also have free wifi.  I guess that means you can bet on the internet about the sports you are watching while you drink and watch with friends.

This is the place to go for an inexpensive pedicure.  The technicians are attentive and pleasant. They do a good job and don't skimp on any details.  They have a great selection of polishes, and usually, can fit you in easily with no appointment.  The place is large and bright, and like most quick nail shops, has no real attention to decor, but because of the size of the place, it doesn't have a dark warehouse feel.   A basic pedicure is $20 and includes a soak and a massage while your back is massaged in the spa chair.   The manicures are good too. The nail techs do a good job of applying and maintaining acrylic tips and overlay.  There are a couple of techs who will do full sculpts, but they prefer to use tips.

Jana's makes some of the BEST baked goods in town.  My only regret is that they don't have longer hours.  I never manage to get there after work, and they seem to adjust some of their hours at will.... so best to call if you are coming from any real distance.  The thing that most people don't realize is, that cheesecake originated in Eastern Europe.  All that "New York Cheesecake" is really grandma Sofia's recipe.  They have the original, made with traditional farmer's cheese.   The other day I was lucky enough to get there while they were open.  I picked up a makoweic, a small poppy seed filled cake.  It was the best I have ever had.

I LOVE Thai food... and Pink Pepper has some very good Thai food. They are the best place in town to get traditional Thai dishes.  Everything I have ever eaten there was well prepared, fresh and consistent.  Their prices push the high end of moderate, and the service is occasionally slow depending on how well staffed they are. That said, you will always have a good meal and never any bad surprises.  It is not the place to go for new imaginative food.  When you want good Thai and are not up to trying anything new, this is a good place to go.

Bamboo House is conveniently located on the Northwest corner of Thunderbird and 7th Street just at the foot of North Mountain.  The parking is adequate and well lit.  Access to the place is easy.  Their menu is a pleasant mix of traditional Chinese food, fresh new dishes and some other Asian favorites with their own twist.  They have an good sized menu, plenty of varied choices, but not so big that you can't decide.  Their delicious lunch specials are served until mid afternoon and include egg roll, crab rangoon and a cup of soup.  One of my absolute faves is their pad thai.  It has just the right amount of spicy for me, although they are happy to dial it up or down for your tastes.  They serve a dinner portion as well as a lunch portion.  The lunch special is enough for 2.... the dinner portion is enough for 2 and you can still take a doggie bag. The only noticeable difference between the lunch and dinner portion of pad thai is that they dinner portion has  has shrimp as well as tofu and chicken.  Other favorites of mine include their lemongrass chicken.  It has a delicious flavor and is made with the best white meat of the chicken.   Mushu Chicken is wonderful.  the sauce is fresh and light. The pancakes are thin and soft.  I like mine with less green onion and more egg.  They are happy to adjust almost anything for you.  Hot and sour soup is excellent, full of vegetables and meats... even shrimp.  Lettuce wraps are good, as are crab rangoon, and traditional egg rolls.  I have tried most everything here.... the only dishes i won't get again were not for lack of quality, they were just not my taste.  I'm not a big sweet and sour fan, and the raspberry chicken might be more suited to someone who is. It was well prepared, just not my taste

This used to be a fantastic place.  Sadly, It is not any longer.  The previous owner sold it, and although the new owner thinks it is the same food, he is mistaken.  My hot and sour soup tasted quite different from the way it had.  The pad thai was entirely different, and the lemongrass chicken no longer the aromatic joy it was before.  The new guy thinks that brown sauce is all the same.  I mourn the loss of my once favorite Chinese food....

Yoga Pura is a beautiful oasis for relaxation and restoration of the self.  The gently lit studios are a wonderful place to learn and practice Yoga.  The shop in the front tantalizes the senses with gentle fragrance and sounds, soft comfortable clothes, tools and accessories for yoga, books, incense burners, CDs and other delightful gift items to share.  The studios are not too big, have gorgeous hardwood floors, and provide a peaceful place for classes or private sessions.  Yoga Pura has wide range of classes including an 8 session introductory package that is perfect for anyone who is new to yoga.  It also makes a great gift.  Yoga Pura also has a yoga instructor certification program that is one of the most respected in Arizona.    They also have massage therapists that are available by appointment.

I have been to 4 or 5 different LA fitness clubs across the Phoenix area, and this club is my favorite by miles.  It isn't the sales staff that makes it great.... LA Fitness is known for having particularly obnoxious sales people and this place is no exception. It is the warm, friendly clientele.  Their mommas taught them how to be nice, and they are doin' a great job of it.  Every time i take the time to say hello, I end up meeting warm wonderful people.  I have been in other locations where I feel like my presence is just an annoyance to the macho grunt heavy specimens staring at themselves in the mirror. You won't find that at this location.    And the friendly atmosphere is genuine, not meet market.  I have met very nice people of all ages, both genders, and probably many orientations.  I may not be fond of the sales staff, but the kids who work the counter and the maintenance staff are top notch.  Couldn't be nicer or more efficient.  The facility is one of the cleanest I have ever been in, and the layout of the club comfortable and efficient.  The cardio is spaced close enough to talk with the people around you, but not so close that you have to climb over them to use it.  There are TVs with FM transmitters within view of most of the second level, and the club below is visible as well.  There are trainers available to help, and there is a juice bar that has bottled water if I forget my own.  I've never used the handball courts, but i see a lot of people there using them every time I am there.  I wasn't real crazy about their spin class.  The whole philosophy of spin is to spin, not pump on the hardest gear possible.  Spin is supposed to be effective for people with knee issues, and it would seem to me that pushing the hardest gear possible contradicts that philosophy.  There are plenty of other classes to take if that is what you prefer.

Now, being from the Midwest, I LOVE a good hunk of BBQ... and like Mathew, I didn't get that here. My friend and i were running errands and decided we wanted a quick BBQ lunch. The place was empty. We were the only people in the entire place.   I have to say, the service was excellent... but it turned out that the guy who waited on us was the older brother of a kid I know, so we may have gotten preferential treatment. I suspect that they are just as attentive to strangers though. The place is very clean and comfortable in a tile meets pleather kind of way, but the food was way below my standards.   I spent the whole time picking through the meat to find a few bites that were not filled with fat. It's too bad that they are willing to serve such fatty meat because the sauce and the side dishes were great.  If only the main dish had been as good as the waiter and the rest of the food.

Oh Noes! You told! This was supposed to be a secret place so we could have it all to ourselves! Now, there will be crowds waiting for the eggplant rollatini and antipasto salads... I'll have to wait in line to get a table so I can have my Shrimp FraDiavolo or my Tortellini. Surely they will be running out of the dinner specials early now that everyone will be flocking there for dinner. I'll have to call ahead to make sure they save a Tiramisu or a cannoli for me.

Yusef's is my old standby place when I crave middle eastern food, Lebanese style.  The Gyros are excellent, right down to the pickle and the sweet onion... mmmmm.  The portions are generous, and everything is always well prepared.  They serve a hummus dis that I really like... it has beef and pine nuts.  The baklavah is good.  They usually have several different varieties.  The place has always been run by really nice people, but the new owners are the nicest people yet.  About a month ago, I was on the way home from visiting my cousin in the hospital when my growling stomach let me know that no food for 12 hours was not making it happy....  I ran into the store at 6:45 pm.  They close at 7.  The owners were at the front counter....   "You're hungry," said the woman looking at me with concern  "yes," I nodded  "Can I get a Gyro, or is it too late."  She looked at her husband... "she's hungry," she said to him...   He hesitated.  "She's hungry!" the wife repeated...  I knew they had probably cleaned up already and were getting a sandwich even though it was inconvenient.  I was so grateful.  It was the best Gyro I have EVER had...    I stop there about once a week now, on my way home from the hospital.  I get a few groceries and something for dinner. I always get there by 6:15 though.

Easily my favorite Pho restaurant in town.  This is a guilt free place to eat.  There are so many light, fresh, low fat, low everything but good stuff dishes here, you can't go wrong.  The selection is good... you can get different BBQ meats, shrimp or meatballs in different combinations over noodles in at least 3 different styles of soups.  They also have dishes that are not soups served over rice or different kinds of noodles.  In addition to the soups and entrees, there is a full selection of appetizers.  My favorite are the spring rolls.... fresh crispy veggies and greens with all the sauces and extras. YUM!  They also have Boba drinks.  I thought Boba was Japanese. I guess it is Vietnamese as well.  The price can't be beat.  An entree is around $5.

Lee Lee is more than an Oriental Supermarket... it's international.  They have aisles of things from South America, Africa, and Great Britain in addition to the expected Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and things from other Asian countries.  I found some Dutch things there that I had not seen outside of the Netherlands, and some things from South America that a friend from Dominican Republic would bring home with her.  The place is huge, and always crowded.  In this case, crowds are good.  I am always able to get help finding things I need from other shoppers who can read the Chinese and Japanese labels.  They have restaurant in the corner.   Walk behind the low wall  on the north side of the building and through the door into the seating area to find a counter that has light fare.  That's were you can find the boba drinks.  Boba rulz!

Gawd i love this place.  Anyone wanna meet me for chicken and waffles???  I got lost the first time i went looking for it, but the search was well worth it.  GREAT chicken and real homemade waffles that put eggos to shame.  Try the mac and cheese too.  I'm sure that if Lolos was closer to my house, i would gain 20 pounds

The Prime is one of my favorite places in Phoenix to go for Chinese food. The place has been open for ages. When i first started going there for dinner, they had white floors and red leatherette booths. The place had the atmosphere of a 50s diner on steroids. Things have changed. The fluorescent lighting has been replaced with decorative halogen track lighting and modern brushed stainless accents. The paper place mats have been replaced by red and white linens. The menu has always been interesting... now, even more than ever.   My favorite back then was Mango Chicken. It's still on the menu, but now my choices are more difficult because there are so many other equally tasty things from which to choose. My favorites now include a delightful curry chicken, anything with pan fried noodles, spring rolls, and hot and sour soup.   Prices are very reasonable, and they are great at accommodating large parties on little notice. The service is great, and i have had no trouble at all getting my meal in a timely fashion when stopping in on my way to another commitment.

In addition to all the rave reviews about Alta Vista staff saving pets from horrible circumstances, i would like to add that they have very reasonable rates for routine care.  I have also boarded dogs there for short trips out of town.  The rates were good, and the dogs were returned happy.

Crazy Jim's is one of those places that all the "in" people know about.  It has been around for ages and has probably been packed each night since the day they opened.  They have several locations, but this is the one I like best.  The atmosphere is Mediterranean-casual. It's the kind of atmosphere I love that reminds me of past adventures in remote corners of Athens, or or little hole in the wall places on the Spanish coast.  For those who don't travel, that means the tables are Formica topped and too close to a noisy kitchen, the aisles are small to non-existent, and the the lighting is an inconsistent no-frills kinda thing that leaves people in one room struggling to read the menu while those in the other room are wishing for sunglasses.  I've seen bigger bathrooms in motor homes.  The only thing missing is the European coffee that no one seems to be able to imitate here. Or maybe they just don't want to.  The menu is big enough for anyone to find a favorite.  They have traditional Greek salads with and without lettuce, pizzas of all varieties, pasta, gyro (pronounced yeer-o) platters and sandwiches, and fantastic calamari.  Dishes are big enough to split, and the pita bread is soft, and fresh off the grill.

Great little place for a manicure or pedicure.  Manicure is $10 and Pedicure is $16.  The place is very clean.  There are plenty of people working, so there is rarely a wait.  My pedicures are always good.  It is the same no matter who is my technician.  I appreciate not having to wait for favorite techs because they are all good.  The techs speak almost exclusively English.  I only mention this because I read a lot of complaints in other reviews for other places about people who think the nail techs are talking about them because they are speaking Vietnamese.  I never have believed that, but some people do.  In this place, they speak mostly English, even when it is not necessary.  That might make some people more comfortable.  I like this place a lot.  I find myself wanting to go back for a mani or pedi earlier than needed because they do such a nice job.

Something terrible has happened to my little Tu Do. They once had the BEST food...now, it is embarrassing. I used to love their curry chicken soup. I would even make the drive just to get it when i lived far away. With memories of that curry chicken pho making my mouth water, i decided to go back again. I was a bit uneasy as I sat near enough to the kitchen to see that things here had changed.   When i was near the kitchen before, i always caught glimpses of gleaming white floors and shiny aluminum... now, it looks dingy and disorganized. I tried to order my soup, and I'm not sure if they were out of the ingredients, or if it has been removed from the menu, but the result is the same. I didn't get any.   The meal i did get was horrible. It was swimming in oil, the vegetables were old and tinged with brown, and the meat wasn't even edible.  I wonder what happened to the nice family that used to own the place.  It is so unlike the way it used to be that I can't even imagine that they are affiliated with it anymore.

I'm sure there have been plenty of reviews for Macayo's Mexican food.  It's a very popular and reasonably priced place to get a good meal.  They have a nice atmosphere for large groups as well.  There have been many many evenings after bike riding in circles for about 2 hours when the bike bunch went for tacos and chimis to refuel..... but the BEST thing on the menu after a long hot ride for my money is the frozen Raspberry Margarita.  Macayo's sells the first jumbo margarita in large politically inappropriate mugs that look like ethnic stereotype effigies.  These can be brought back for refills of the frozen salty sweet drink each visit.  In my opinion, they are well worth it....

Gotta love ANY bar in old town that is almost devoid of scottstitutes.  I didn't see any bimbettes wearing the traditional old town scottstitute uniform (bleached blond hair, FMPs, and a black spandex mini)  Great place.  excellent hanging outside and lots of good corners inside.

There are 4 good reasons to go to Coffee Plantation...  1. It isn't Starbucks 2. There are still plenty of things that they do not overcharge for 3. Free WIFI 4. The people watching is still the best free floor show in town

DQ is DQ..... what else can be said.  All I wanted was a dip cone.  I got my dip cone in a timely manner.  The place was clean, the employees were nice.  I was happy with my cone, but after all..... it is still just a DQ.

Tradition at it's most... er.... um.... traditional. Every time i eat here i feel like i have been transported to any number of old family owned steakhouses on the North Shore of Long Island, or Brooklyn. The plush red velvet, the dark wood and button tufted leather... The place just screams STUFFY BUSINESS LUNCH. My first experience here was with a bunch of lawyer friends who were dying for meatloaf or a steak with creamed spinach...   The entrance is through the kitchen. That may seem a little odd, but I'd bet it sells dinners. Who can resist the wonderful aroma. By the time you reach your table, you crave rare beef, as red as the decor.   It's the kind of place where you forgo the trendy drinks and have a Scotch with a splash,or a Rob Roy before dinner. The steaks are perfectly prepared, the garlic mashed potatoes are wonderful. I love the place. It isn't cheap, and admittedly, i have never paid for my own meal there. It has always been a treat from some friend who wears a suit to work, or some more traditional back easterner who wants to share their bit of meat and potato lovers heaven.

I needed a margarita... yes, needed.  I needed it immediately and I needed it icy cold.  Closest watering hole was a mile away.... and it was open.  Via DeLosantos has a list of tequilas that is 2 pages long... you can get a terrific margarita and a good dinner for 2 for under $30.    After our emergency first aid kit of frozen margaritas and margaritas on the rocks, we relaxed our way through 2 bowls of salsa, chips and guacamole... then came the tacos and chili rellenos....  The atmosphere is a little of Rocky Point meets garage-Quonset hut shabby Mexican craft chic.  It is ultra casual, but in my opinion, NOT seedy.  It's colorful, and loud, and comfortable with liberal use of paint.  It was the perfect way to wind down after a long day.... I think I'll have one more.  Did i mention that the house Margaritas are $.99.  Good too

Los Dos Molinas has been THE dining destination of choice for cyclists headed to South Mountain. We would ride our bikes there in the morning on Sunday.... they would let us put our bikes safely inside in the back, and we would proceed to chow down on a magnificent fiery hot, carb filled, stick to your ribs meal that would fuel us for the long (and much slower) ride back.  I had my first taste of Huevos Rancheros at Los Dos Molinas..... and my first horchata.  Everything I have EVER eaten there has been wonderful.  It is truly an amazing place.

Of all the teppanyaki places I have ever been, this is my favorite.  This is also the only one that serves sea bass.  They have the usual shrimp, chicken, lobster, calamari, 5 cuts of steak and Wagyu beef (kobe that is raised outside of japan) beef or any combination of the listed choices ... but the sea bass is my absolute favorite.  Their Teppanyaki chefs are skilled and wonderful to watch.    Sapporo has a solid happy hour.  The prices are not as good as others, but there are plenty of reduced price cocktails, sushi and dims to choose from.  Drinks run from $5 up to $12.  Sushi, dim sum and bowls range between $6 and $13.  The people watching is priceless.  The sushi bar is entertaining.  The sushi is fresh and delicious.  If you don't feel like a teppanyaki choice, they have a complete fusion menu infused with Korean, Thai, Hawaiian and Western flavors.

I know you can't stay away from this place, but don't go to Chino's for lunch. Seriously.  It's packed.  You have to wait in line forever.  Go for dinner.....   I'm convinced that the food here is truly addictive.  I have tried to stay away, but i can't.  The carnitas and egg foo yung keep calling my name.  I have been known to bring their volcano cookies and a pound of just about any entree to potluck dinners.  I like to take "Chino Virgins" there so that they can taste from the sample selection.  Then I watch them get all confused when they have to choose just 1 or 2 things.  (I'm easily entertained.)  Try this.  Emerald chicken Quesedilla with sour cream and lettuce. mmmm foodgasms.

I just had such a good lunch.... mmmmmm   I had Eggs Benedict, Fez style.  Their version has french bread, ham, poached egg, hollandaise and sun dried tomatoes.  They serve a salad on the side and I substituted their sweet potato fries instead of fried red potatoes that usually come with. It was excellent.   I couldn't have had a better first visit to Fez.  Fez during the day is bright, airy and beautiful.  The bar is comfortable, and the tables looked good too.  I look forward to being there in the evening.... and after the construction is done. For now, while the road is still a construction zone, don't let the black and yellow signs scare you away.  It isn't that hard to access, and the food and atmosphere are worth it.

Matts feels like home. The tables remind me of snack time in Grandma's kitchen, the salt and pepper shakers remind me of the ones that sat on my neighbor's counter in her collections.... even the slightly wobbly leg of the chair reminds me of my college apartment furnished with family castaways and thrift shop treasures.   REAL food comes from a place that feels so much like home... by real, i mean... real eggs, real butter, real sausage....   Food at Matt's is pure and innocent... Pancakes with butter. Eggs with potatoes and bacon. Classic.   yum.

This is one of my favorite bars in town to kick back with friends and have a good time.    The sandwiches are HUGE, well priced and yummy.  The beer on tap is cold. They have a very well stocked bar for Irish specialties, and the servers and bartenders are attentive and friendly.   It's great for groups... When I have gone with a group, we had the whole upstairs balcony to ourselves.    The bar is comfortable for single women... people are friendly, not gropey.  Very nice.   The booths are big and comfy... I have seen people having their own little game night at the booths.  They can play all night and never have to get up for a beer.  One table was playing Uno.  Not a bad idea.  4-6 fit easily in a booth and there is good access to dancing (which often spills over into the aisles around the bar)  Maybe we need another UYE.  I'd be there early.

Whenever i get a craving for some distant memory of a food, and that craving won't go away.... i start whining.  So it was yesterday.  I had been sitting all day with my cravings for real Hawaiian food for what seemed like weeks. I decided to commiserate with a friend who had grown up in Hawaii.  I thought it might make it better.  It was worse.  I started off telling her how i sure could use a big bowl of Saiman for lunch, and didn't laulau and kalua pig sound good? Pretty soon we were both drooling for lomi lomi salmon and manapua.  I was ready to run all the way across town to Mesa.  "Oh, my friend exclaimed, Why don't you go to L & L?"  I thought she was kidding.  Sure, I'll grab a flight to Hawaii this afternoon....   "No, There is one at Happy Valley and I-17, across from the Lowes."  Needles to say, I spent the rest of the day planning my route home.  I would have to go about 10 miles out of my way, but there wouldn't be traffic.....  L & L doesn't have haoli Hawaiian food, they have REAL Hawaiian food.  I walked in to hear the woman ahead of me order a loco moco plate lunch.  There was a big poster advertising that laulau has only 1 carb, and a paper plate hanging on the service pass through proclaiming "Linguica special" in blue magic marker.  This place has it all.  They have Saiman (a Hawaiian version of ramen but the noodles and garnishes are more fun), Musubi (even with spam), manapua (steamed or fried pork roll), haupia (thick coconut cream desert), Poi (pounded taro root), poke (raw tuna seaweed salad), lomi lomi salmon (chopped raw salmon rubbed with chili and onion served with chopped tomatoes), BBQ short ribs, and all other sorts of Hawaiian favorites.  I had a plate lunch.  A traditional plate lunch has a scoop or 2 of rice made with an ice cream scoop, a scoop of macaroni salad made with lots of mayo and Maui onion, and one or 2 main dish items.  Mine were laulau and kalua pig.  Laulau is pork, butterfish and ti leaves with Hawaiian salt, wrapped up in taro leaves and steamed til it can almost melt in your mouth. Kalua pig has to be simulated because the traditional cooking method used to achieve the smokey flavor cannot be approved by the USDA.  Traditional method is a rock lined pit.  The pit is then lined with leaves and the meat (a whole pig) is lowered in then covered with more leaves.  It is then covered to keep the heat in.  I have no idea how they do it, but there is probably smoke flavoring, Hawaiian salt, and a large amount of ti leaves involved.  The Kalua Pig is delicious.  I loved every morsel, and today I have a little leftover vacation to the islands waiting for me at lunch time.

Bookman's already has plenty of reviews from others.  I agree, it is a wonderful place to fine used books.  You can't beat the prices, and the staff are always nice.  They are a fantastic source for old books.  If you want new editions or current maps, you might want to pay full price at the stores that carry new books because you won't find them here.  I want to point out that they have free wifi.  It is not alweays dependable.... but that is the way a lot of things are at Bookmans.  It's part of the charm.  It makes everyone feel like a starving student again.

Ikea is an event in furniture and home decor shopping.  I've tried to "pop in for a couple of things" but it never works.  I end up lookin' around for way too long...  First, I wander around on the top floor looking at all the ways I could improve my kitchen.  Then I meander through the living room and office furniture before realizing I'm kinda hungry for one of their shrimp salad sammies.  I almost always try something else in addition to my little shrimp thing while promising myself to come early next time and have their $1.99 breakfast.  After I nibble a bit, I remember that i really stopped in for energy saver light bulbs.  Ikea has a huge selection of CFLs, so I wander downstairs toward the lighting department.  The problem is, I have to go through the kitchenware department.  They always have some kind of cheap kitchen tools or entertaining stuff.  Last time, I bought a $5 whistling teapot and $.50 cooking spatula, fork and spoon sets.  then I wander through the window treatments vowing to actually measure my windows before my next Ikea visit.  I never remember  I get my CFLs and a few other things, then make my way to the dent and ding shop.  I've gotten some great things in the dent and ding shop.  Don't miss it.  Then I grab a few pot holders, paper goods  and fancy ice cube trays  on my way to the checkout.  There are even things to distract you AFTER you check out.... like Scandinavian packaged food.  I grab an ice cold diet soda on my way out the door....   I look at my watch and notice that my half hour errand took 3 hours.

I agree with the others.... the food is horrible.  They do their best at service, and are very nice.... but that is no reason to eat here.  Unless it is a holiday and everyplace in town is closed.... i WOULD choose it over McDonalds.  That isn't saying much.

Take a Seattle style coffee house, the cellar coffee bar from some private university somewhere, an NYC Gelato "stand" and an old Shakey's Pizza parlor.... put them in a blender and pulse.  Add too much space, FREE WIFI and the highest quality coffee available and this is what you get.

I had been to another location, and while the food was acceptable there (not good, just acceptable) it was HORRIBLE here.  Our $40 got us an order of pastitsio that  was so dried out and overcooked we could not split it with a knife.  Not even a steak knife. The slices of crispy edged gyro meat I was looking forward to in our Greek salad were nowhere in sight.  Instead we were given an undercooked cubed version of the same.  Our Baba ghanoush was not the light whipped consistency it should have been.... it was a smoky thick heavy texture.  No one ate it. It was left on the plate.  The patio was nice.  It would have been pleasant to sit there and eat.... if the meal hadn't been so horrid.  The only redeeming quality here was the service.  The waiter a man who appeared to be the manager were terrific.  They were friendly and quick to check on us the whole time we were there.  I hope they find jobs at better restaurants because i would like to be waited on by them again, but I will NOT be going back there.

So now I remember....  I remember why I never make the trip down here on Saturday mornings. I remember why the market is more crafts than produce I remember why regular grocery stores get my business when I grew up shopping at a public market...  I don't go to Phoenix Farmers Market because there are no farmers there.  The place is over run with ladies who make crafts and a few artists.  There are prepared food vendors selling their not so interesting food at boutique prices.  There were a couple I found interesting enough to consider... the pickle lady, boutique chocolates and Eastern European bakery goods come to mind, but the rest were a waste of my time.  For any produce market to grow and be successful they have to offer something better than the grocery stores.  That "something better" is usually a cheaper price.  It is easier for vendors to do so because they don't have the overhead of a store and all the associated expenses.  Most cities have markets where the vendors pull up their step van, open the back, and literally sell out of the back of the truck.  The Phoenix Market vendors don't seem to be aware of this.  They bring a red wagon of produce out of their yard and display it in little packages.  They think we should all pay extra because they are local.  As long as they charge at least twice as much for their goods as any other store in town, there is no reason for people to buy.... other than the feeling of being charitable.  In my opinion, there are better charities than overpaying to a vendor who feels like the world owes it to them for being local.  Simple laws of supply and demand.  As long as they price is lower elsewhere, they won't have my "support."  That doesn't mean I don't support local growers.  I can stop at any number of markets and get flowers for half what I saw being charged today. $7 is a little steep for a bunch of wildflowers when I can get a bunch of daffodils for $1.49 at my corner store.  I can buy Hickman's eggs at most local stores for less... and shamrock is local as well.  The one i found particularly insulting was a seedling basil plant for $7 while a huge bushy plant in a 7" pot is less than half that at a regular  store.  If I want a seedling plant in a Dixie cup, I can push a seed in some dirt and wait for 3 days too.  Nope.... I won't be buying things at the Phoenix market.  I don't need to pay a premium to the vendors for the privilege of finding them all in one place on a Saturday morning.  I will probably do better stopping at the produce stands along 99th ave on my way home from work every now and then, or the trucks that park on the corners on the outer edges of our city

Great spot for a quick after or before work hike.  The popular summit trail has 2 trailheads.  One is on 7th street just north of the main park entrance.  The parking here is usually impossible during peak hours.  I suggest going to the main entrance, taking the park loop north to the top of the hill and parking there.  That pavilion has more parking, a water fountain, and is easy to access.  There is also a park restroom just across the road.  I won't promise it will be clean or even open though.  Honestly, I have only used it once.... that was on the 4th of July, and it was only mildly offensive (as far as park toilets go)   The summit trail is short steep hike with pavement the last 2/3 of the way.  I like to go up and back in the afternoon, after work.  Sometimes i just go for a run on the loop around the park.    There is also a back way to the summit. The trail for that is near the south end of the park behind the pavilion at the bottom of the hill.  That trail is very rough and easy to lose.  I suggest going up that side and down the main summit trail.

Wah Sun is one of my FAVORITE places to stop for fast FRESH  inexpensive Chinese food.  It is located in what was once a neighborhood with a good sized Asian population, and while one or two of the most popular places in the neighborhood have either disappeared or gone badly downhill, Wahsun thrives.  Nothing at this restraunt is overprocessed or pre-readied.  Even the eggrolls have larger chunks and are made ready to cook when ordered.    The food is cooked in a very hot wok, giving it a delightful seared flavor.  Like many "old school" Chinese places, they have a regular menu, and a menu that is more geared toward diners who read something other than English.  My favorite is their third menu.  Leave it in the hands of the chef.... I prefer their stirfry flounder with bok choy instead of celery, so it is made that way for me.  I like scallops with snow peas in a ginger sauce instead of garlic, and they are happy to prepare that.  When i walked in one day, Rose told me I HAD to try the crab because they were fresh that day.  I did.  I'm not sure how it was prepared, but I am certain it was not on the menu....  it was wonderful.  Another time, I was greeted by Rose with the words you like cauliflowers? Because today I make cauliflowers for you."  I have learned that no matter what it is, I should say yes.

No, I don't want to take the bus to get to the train.   In my opinion, they didn't go far enough for people who live in Phoenix. It may be a good solution for Tempe and Mesa residents commuting to Phoenix, but it isn't effective for Phoenicians who want to get from the north valley into CenPho.

After reading the wonderful reviews of this place, I decided to stop in to get my fix instead of the little Vietnamese place in the corner of Lee Lees.  I tossed my grocery bags in the car,  Grabbed my $4 and hiked across the parking lot to Boba Tea House.  Last time I drove by Boba Tea House, the place was packed.  Not true of this visit.  It was so empty the place echoed.  It's a cute place.  I like the couches, and they have a couple of lappies on a table at the side for people to use.  I am going to assume it is free because while I was there, a guy popped in, used a laptop, and left.  Either he's a regular and has an account, or it was free because i didn't see him pull out a card to credit to use it.  The Orange and Green wall menu has all the milk teas, slushes, snows and other beverages divided into categories.  Most are named for exactly what they are.  A couple are named for appearance.... like sunset, but not enough to confuse anyone.  There is also a section for snacks that has tasty tidbits that are perfectly sized for sharing.  I noticed coconut shrimp, and a few other little fried things.  I decided to have a coconut slush.  It was good, but it was not as good as I thought it would be.  It was a little bitter, and a was not blended as well as I have had in other places.  The snack I chose for lunch was the really delightful surprise.  I came for the boba, but now I am hooked on their calamari.  I have NEVER had fresher or more tender calamari.  It was absolutely perfect.  I'm always cautious about it too because most places overcook it til it is about the same texture as a bicycle inner tube.... this was delicious.  I had it medium spicy, which was MY mistake.    Next time I will order my calamari spiced mild.  It's a good thing I got coconut boba to cool my taste buds after each bite.

Fresh designs, a team of 2 talented stylists, and a unique atmosphere.... this hair salon and artspace is a cross between the Adams Family and Greenwich Village.    I found this place through my neighbor.  She came home one night with the most gorgeous magenta streaks in her deep brown hair.  I just had to know who did it.  Since then, she has had gold streaks, copper streaks, and most recently, deep purple streaks. (They were to die for)  Michael made my hair dark brown, deep auburn, burgundy red, and back to my normal coppery orange. Michael is a genius with color.  For the men.... Michael's specialty is carving Celtic and modern designs into short hair.  They are currently in process of moving the salon from Thomas and 5th Ave, to a new location on 16th street.  Call for an appointment and the new location  They have completed their move to 4215 N. 16th Street

Ok, I give up... how are pizza and salad like Boston Market?  I guess they both have food.  I can't see ANYTHING similar other than that.  This is a little bistro that sells salads made to your specs, sandwiches the way you choose, and another version of not real pizza (but it tastes good) also served the way you want it.   They have a wide variety of beverages ranging from sodas, teas and coffees to beer and wine.  The view on the patio isn't bad for being on a main street, and the owner treats the young counter help (when the place opened they were all friends of the family) like family.... so they treat the clientelle like family as well. Good formula for neighborhood success.  If you want roast turkey with a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, don't come here.  Go to Boston Market.

Health Net is the worst!  It is hard enough to find a doctor that you like enough to see again, they make it even more difficult.  I searched their database to see if my pcp was listed, and she was.  I signed on the dotted line and paid up- and then went to the directory again to see if any of my other doctors were in the list.  They were not.  I looked again to see if my pcp, who I had seen there as a condition of my taking their plan, and she was not.  Their sales "consultant" had manipulated the directory to show her, and said she was there, when she was not.  I went to 3 vision centers before I found a doctor who would accept their insurance.  I finally found one who was listed at 2 locations, one of which was the welfare clinic (AHCCCS).  I paid over $400 a month to line up with all the AHCCCS patients?  Eventually, I sorted it out, found another doctor who could bill HealthNet because he is in the same medical group as the one running the clinic (who i'm sure is a wonderful and tremendously overworked doctor to take on all those AHCCCS patients)     Now, they want $140 MORE per month for 2016.  In addition to raising my rate they sent a list of additional exclusions that they will not cover.  They will not cover federally mandated medical procedures unless the patients life is at risk.  Ok, read that as: Despite having been made legal in all states, they are refusing to provide abortion under a plan that is NOT being subsidized by taxpayer money.  I am getting no discount or supplement  to my monthly premium by ANY government agency.  This is not a benefit I will ever use, but being told that HealthNet is all up in the decisions concerning MY uterus is offensive to me and a breech of the freedom for which everyone claims to be supporting.  I thought my research was so complete last year when I chose the plan.  I was actually guided to the plan by someone on their payroll.  To add insult to injury, I discovered too late that they must have some connection with Walmart, which in my opinion is very revealing.  Now I need to go to Walmart and see if there are any loopholes I need to close in order to ditch this awful plan.

I went to Hana expecting wonderful sushi. It wasn't.  There were some very enjoyable things about Hana, and although it wouldn't be my first choice, I would go back if the choice was up to someone else.  The location is very convenient.  The place is small, and comfortable.  It looks inviting, and the employees are friendly.  They have a very interesting menu, but I had sushi only on this visit.  The sushi is served in a decorative wooden boat. Everything was very fresh, but not what I hoped for...   The sushi was not bad, it just wasn't great.  It was a bit loosely rolled, and fell apart too easily.  They used fake crab instead of the real thing, but did not make that clear on their menu, and they did not have a couple of the things on their menu.  I was really looking forward to their  tamago.  They had not made any that  day.  The waitress who corrected my order and refunded the money I was charged for the tamago was not happy.  It didn't seem to bother her that an item on their regular menu was not available, and I had been charged.  What bothered her is that she had to correct the sale and give me back the overcharge.    It wasn't the best experience, but as I said, the food was very fresh, and except for that one waitress, the employees were very nice.  I will probably give the place another try, it just won't be for a while.

They are advertising this place as the "Times Square of the West." Clearly, they have not been to New York.  There is nothing that Westgate Center has in common with Times Square.  The parking lot is huge, but badly arranged.  Even the handicapped spots were a long walk for one of my friends  The plaza is anchored by sports/concert venues.  When there are no sports events or concerts to bring in the traffic, there is a large movie theater.  They have also taken a lot of care to make several large public areas with fountains and other attractive focal points.  It is pretty, but an ineffective use of space that fails miserably in its attempt to provide services to concert goers and sports fans.  There were not even enough places available for several coworkers and i to enjoy having lunch there.  The rest of the plaza is supposed to be bustling with entertainment and activity to support the events at the main venues.  It is not.   I thought it was because a lot of places had not opened, but i think the problem is deeper than that. There are several chain restaurants with bars.  Try going to one of those restaurants before your concert for dinner.  They look at you like you have lost your mind.  The problem is, there are so few places, and they are all packed and understaffed.   The ones i tried acted as if they were insulted that i didn't want to wait til after my concert had started to sit down. This wouldn't be bothersome if they were using their entire seating space and had a full staff of waiters, but it looked like there were sections of the places that were not being used at all.  Perhaps they are waiting for the Superbowl to open those remaining 8 tables.  .

Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food.  The food is fresh, and delightful.  The menu is extensive and has all the traditional Vietnamese dishes I expected.   In addition to Pho, they serve other noodle (rice noodle and saigon noodle) and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads. Under no circumstances would I compare it to Cyclo.  Cyclo is not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant... Pho Avina is.  I would compare the variety and quality to Saigon Pho on Alma school, which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have a nice selection of boba drinks.  I had a coconut one this time. I have had Avocado, Coffee, and mango as well.  So far, coconut is my favorite.  I think next time I will try taro.  mmmmm.... so good. I was so enamored with this place that I expect to stop there on the way home from work at least once every week or 2.  I need to add this note now..... since I first reviewed this place, it has become a real favorite of mine.  I stop here at least 1 or 2 times a week, and when I do, I often run into friends who learned about the place from me.  I'm headed there for dinner tonight.

There are so many good places to get Greek food in Phoenix.  You should go to one of those places because this is not one of them.  The place is VERY overpriced for what it is.  The cheapest meal was $12, and the most pricey was $43.  They had a few Greek wines and  a few California wines on their list.  Wine was not particularly impressive, yet they were charging $6 for a glass.  Some of the wines were things I have purchased for less than $4 a bottle.   The restaurant is located in a plaza behind a Wendy's and next to a Kinko's.  The interior is an uninviting cross between your elderly Aunt Ethel's white 1980s vacation condo and an ice cream shop.  Everything is white, cold and hard..... and it echoes.  The food was mediocre at best.  We started with the Dolmades, which tasted like packaged food.  They were far to lemony.... almost on the verge of a fermenting flavor, and were very mushy.  The pita bread that was served with them was good.  That pita bread turned out to be the best part of the meal.  We opted for Greek Spaghetti, and a Gyro plate.  First we were served salads.  Greek salads are usually full of cucumber, tomato, feta and olives.  Our salads were almost completely devoid of these ingredients.  Our salads were almost completely iceberg lettuce, white onion, and green bell pepper.  The salads were fresh, but very dry, as if the lettuce had never been washed... had been cut, then left  out til the edges dried out.  The spaghetti was prepared to the proper firmness, but the seasoning was unimpressive.  It was buttered with an excessive amount of garlic, then tossed with tomatoes.  There was supposed to be feta cheese in mine.  I counted the little chunks.  I didn't have to count very high. There were 2.  To be fair, I did see another table had been served the same thing.  I wouldn't have known it except I asked.  Their Greek Spaghetti looked nothing like the bowl which we were served.  I'm guessing that consistency is not a strong thing here.  I expected that the gyro plate would be good.  Gyro meat in Phoenix is not prepared on site.  It is ordered from a supplier and roasted at the restaurant.  I figured there was less opportunity for it to be bad.  I was wrong.  It was very bad.  There were no nice crispy edges.  It was undercooked and sliced too thickly. What a disappointment.  The only redeeming quality was the patio, which was fairly well tucked away from the street, considering the surroundings, and the waitress.  The waitress was very pleasant and gave excellent service.  Too bad the food was not good enough to get me to return.

Basis is a great neighborhood place.  They have evening drink specials a couple of nights a week.  I've been there for imported beer night, when a bottle of beer is half price, and for wine night when a glass of wine is half their regular price.  Each time, I tried a dfferent appetizer or split a different entree. I admit I have not loved each and every one, but all were well executed and creative.  They use the very highest quality ingredients, and their menu is never boring. The service has always been exceptional.  I keep it on my list of neighborhood hangouts because it is a great place to relax with a friend for a meal, or just for a glass of wine at their bar.

Farmer's markets in Phoenix are always a let down... and this one is no exception.  There simply are no farmers.  There are one or two people who buy a bit of bulk produce and resell.  There are a couple of people who have cuttings and small plants... then there are the crafters  and resellers who sell cute little things they buy and embellish or make.  Depending on the time of year, there is a baker, and there is usually a person who makes olives or pickles.  I don't count the olive guy and the hot sauce guy as "farmers" because their products are actually made in commercial kitchens and have slick packaging so they can sell off their website.  Nope.... there just isn't a farmers market in Phoenix, but it is a nice place to walk when the weather is good and I feel like a nice walk.  For a real farmer's market:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/soulard-farmers-market-saint-louis

Plan for this meal.  You MUST plan for this meal because one sandwich is big enough to be food for the whole day.  The location is in a tiny strip mall just north of Dunlap.  It's nothing fancy.  Expect to see all kinds of people, lots of them, and they are all talking loudly.  This afternoon, when I was there, the place was packed with Hispanic families with lots of small kids, a bunch of older white haired people who must live nearby and their newspapers, a couple of tourists, and a nice kid who said his brother had sent him to pick up dinner.  He had never been there and looked around cautiously at the place until the waitress finally spoke English to him.  Since the place is named for the beautiful sandwiches they serve, I will start with those...  soft buns are loaded with different combinations of ham, breaded beef, pork sirloin, eggs,  chicken, cheese, guacamole, assorted peppers or chilies, tomato and sometimes a little onion... One torta is more than enough for 2 people.  They have taco plates with 3 tacos for under $5.  Their tacos come in varieties you may not have considered before... How about beef tongue tacos? or perhaps beef brains?  For the less adventurous, they have Hawaiian (beef, bacon, ham, bell peppers, pineapple, and cheese) or chorizo.  I like the shrimp quesedillas... also big enough to split. There are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu.  I should try a few others, but every time I walk in the door, I can hear the quesedilla calling my name.  They have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets, and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream, honey or sweet cream for dessert.  They also have flan in different flavors.  I noticed a good breakfast menu that is served before 11 am, but I have never tried it. I think I would end up going home to sleep off the food if I tried to eat a big meal like that in the AM.

Like Jared, I have to say that I didn't pay for the evening.  It was Yelp sponsored.  I did notice that it is pretty pricey if you are footing your own bill.  We were provided a selection of 5 different items, and all were delicious.   Some were presented better than others, but all were wonderful.  They served crispy fried squid with lime in bowls a little larger than soup cups.  There was a half a lime, and a little jalapeno slice in there too. Other than the garnish. it only had a hint of spice.  Not too much.  The next plate was soft shell crab sushi rolls.  Those were a big hit.  They served steamed pork and scallop gyoza that were tasty as well. The chicken skewers with leek were very nice.  They had a crispy edge that set them apart from others, but would still be a good choice if you are there with picky eaters.  My favorite of the evening was the butterfish tataki with white asparagus.  It was a most delicate fish with just a touch of ginger in the shallot dressing.  The decor is clean and comfortable.  The comfortable couches and chairs are perfect for hanging out with lots of friends, or for pulling off in the corner for a romantic evening with just one....  The staff was very attentive.  I also want to add that the valet parking guy was charming, and really fast to retrieve my car.  I would go there again with friends to share some little dishes and wine.

Bomberos Cafe & Wine Bar is my new neighborhood hangout.  It's perfect.  The patio is lovely, the inside decor is charming and in addition to an artfully created wine list, they have a delightful menu for social munching.  They aren't just a wine bar.... With their morning coffee and pastries, their dog friendly patio, and their free wifi, Bomberos is earning a place in the neighborhood in the morning as well.  When owners Oscar and Kristi Mastrantuono chose their location, he had some ready made advantages as well as some interesting challenges.  The building is an old firehouse, thus the name Bombero which means fireman in Spanish.  The space is small, but they retained the firehouse doors.  On days when the weather cooperates, I suspect that they will be able to open those doors and expand seating to the ample walkway in front of the station.  Any area big enough to hold a few fire trucks is certainly big enough for a few patio tables.  The Mastrantuonos have used the area in back of the building to good advantage.  He has created a delightful seating area.  The landscape is soothing and enchantingly lit with candles, strategically placed electric lights and a central fire pit. There are couches and chairs toward the back which appear to be a stage area for the nights when they have live music.  The interior is just spare enough to be dramatic while still maintaining warmth and intimacy.  The night I was there, they had arranged vases of tulips on the tables and community seating areas.  The contrasting textures, of lots of steel, mirrors, brick and glass did not overwhelm those beautiful tulips.  So it is with their clientele... the environment enhances, never overwhelms.  Bomberos opens at 7am each morning with coffee and pastries.  I expect that they will do well during the mornings.  In addition to good coffee and pastries, they provide free wifi.  That will make it very easy for people working nearby to stop in for their break, or arrange morning meetings on their patio.  The wine list is exclusively South American.  They have some inspired choices.  I was only able to try 2, and managed to taste a sip of 2 others.  I loved the La Yunta 2005 Torronts.  I had the Cousino Macul Antiguas Reservas Cabernet which was good, but didn't capture my taste buds the way the La Yunta did. The 2 Brothers Big Tattoo was more to my liking.  Not only was that delicious, $.50 of every bottle sold goes to "charities benefiting breast cancer research.  I can drink with a social conscience.  It is easy to find things on the menu to enhance your wine choices.  They have 5 different Bruchetta.  For $10 you select 3 varieties for your plate.  Of the three chosen by the friend who accompanied me that evening, i loved one, and thought the other 2 were good, but nothing exceptional.  They serve panini for $10 with the same toppings, and an additional 2 that sounded good.  A cheese plate is custom made for $16.  They have a list of 5 cheeses from which the customer can select 3.  The cheeses are served with dried fruit, nuts and fresh bread.  They have a meat plate for $14 too.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and wine list at Bomberos.  Next time, I will try more of their food.  I did have the chance to talk to Oscar before leaving.  He is a charming host.  I didn't get a chance to meet Kristi.  Perhaps I will meet her on my next visit.

Big fun!  One of the best run marathons i have ever seen.  The entertainment along the way keeps your spirits up, even when your feet are dying.  My only problem was that i was too wiped out after the marathon to enjoy the free admission to the after concert/party

Fresh and Easy is opening in June 2008.  They have broken ground on the site and are about halfway through the foundation.  Fresh and Easy is a subsidiary of the popular Tesco chain from Great Britain.  They have smaller stores stocked with ready to heat dinners, and foods that have been prepared enough to require minimal preparation before serving.    One can find salads that are ready to serve as well as salad mix in bags and small packages of meats or cheeses to toss on top.  They have fresh dressings, fresh juices (some unpasteurized) and smaller sized bags of vegetables and potatoes.  It isn't necessary to buy a 10 lb bag of potatoes or overpriced single potatoes anymore.  On my last trip to fresh and easy, i picked up a package of shrimp for shrimp cocktail, a heat and serve ravioli dinner, real cheddar cheese (not the US soft yellow version) and separate packages of pasta and sauce.  They had a wine aisle with quite a few good reasonably priced choices, and a meat aisle with plenty of sausages, beef, pork, and chicken cuts... all hormone free.  The meat prices were very good considering that they are comparable to other grocers and are still providing hormone and antibiotic free meats for which others are horribly overcharging.  The only thing i thought was lacking was the selection of sugar free beverages in the soda aisle.  I just don't think grocers can use the excuse that no one wants them anymore.  Consumers have become more health conscious and no longer want extra sugar.  I hope they will correct this and have plenty of the staples i need when the new store opens in June.

If Helena Rubenstein was alive today, she would have a cot in the back room of MAC Cosmetics.  MAC has raised cosmetics to an art.  The colors are intense and varied, the product range in the tiny store can keep a shopper busy for hours.... Sales staff are well trained in their line.  They have seasonal specials ranging from new limited edition colors to perfume.  Make an appointment for make up application which is free with the purchase of $50 in product.

Yes, there is a sushi god, and he has plopped a sushi place right down at Thunderbird and 7th Street.    It's open! and not only is it sushi, it's HAWAIIAN SUSHI!  The place is tiny, very intimate. The walls are deep blue and the seating is like a lot of Japanese bars, very stark... but these are lime green.  The menu is terrific, with all the traditional sushi, sashimi, and extras... plus, they have a ton of really original specialty rolls.  I love their sushi.  I thank the sushi gods because it is in my neighborhood and I can pick up a yummy roll for dinner on my way home.... and I don't even have to go out of the way to do it.  mmmmm..... sushi!

Another Fresh and Easy opened this week.... I'm still waiting for one in MY neighborhood, but this is closer.  If you go to Fresh & Easy the first week they are open, they will give you a book of 4 coupons that are good for $5 off your purchases over the next 4 weeks.  Who can argue with $5 in free stuff you would have paid for anyway???  They have good drive up access at this location.  The parking lot is good sized.  Employees were particularly helpful.  Fresh and Easy has been getting additional products to suit the needs of their community.  I noticed that they ask if there is anything you need and they write it down.  I also noticed that the 2 other stores that i have been to since their openings have added products that i didn't see when they opened.  Nice to know they listen to their clientele.

YAY! Another Fresh and Easy is opening! And... this one is getting closer!  Their Grand Opening is Friday Feb. 15th.  That means more free stuff for everyone who stops in.  They give out $20 worth of free groceries to everyone who stops in that day in the form of 4 $5 coupons. If you don't need groceries, you should at least drop in and buy me some flowers. I deserve them for telling you about this terrific place.  Grab some Newcastle too.

If Imelda Marcos visited AZ on vacation, this is where she would spend her time and money.  DSW claims to have over 2000 styles on display at any given store.  I believe them.  The aisles are packed with hundreds of shoes.  DSW goes the extra mile to make shoe shopping comfortable.  You are never more than a few steps from a bench or chair where you can sit to try on your finds.  They have mirrors everywhere so shoppers don't have to wander around looking.  They place large shopping bags on hooks throughout the store to make carrying easier, and the service is always fast and friendly.  Maybe Imelda would just move in.

Michael's is my favorite place to have things framed.  The selection of frames is huge.  They have a good selection of acid free papers and lots of choices for cuts and bevels as well. Their prices are reasonable, even more reasonable if you wait for their half off framing coupons that appear in the newspaper at least twice a month.   I have had no less than 50 lithos, photos, paintings and such framed by Michael's and they have never damaged anything or caused me worry over any of them.   They are not the quickest, but they have work done when they say it will be done.

Lee lee is more than an Asian market....  it's an experience.  I won't complain about the fish smell.    ALL Asian markets smell fishy.  Almost all the major grocers have eliminated their fresh fish departments from their stores.  Most places in Phoenix offer 2 or 3 fish choices on a regular basis... Lee Lee offers dozens of choices, and often, many of those choices are still swimming around in tanks.   I like the produce department.  Lots of choices and all cheaper than anywhere in town.  This location is supposed to have a "food court" kn the front but it hasn't been ready yet in the times I have been there.   I love that they have food divided in areas by location, and that it isn't all Asian.  I shop the European aisles for things i have discovered while in the UK and in Holland, and there is a section in which i have found a lot of Hawaiian things too.  Today, I'm going to get boba supplies, Dashi and stuff to put in saiman, and lots of things to make Thai soups like Tom Ka Gai.

Of all the Sephora stores in the Phoenix area, why does THIS one have to have the best inventory of them all??? The location is not convenient, and I am not very fond of the west side of town  This is the ONLY store that carries the COMPLETE line of "Make Up For Ever," affectionately known by professionals as MUFE.  Make Up For Ever started as a line for professionals only.... and it had none of the small sized products they have today for the everyday consumer.  It was all pigments and bases for theatrical use... but the quality was so much better and more innovative than anything on the market that the consumers in France forced into general production by high demand.    I love this line so much, I used to make a special trip to Sephora when I was in Las Vegas or New York..... finally one of the Phoenix area stores carries the whole line.

Chompies has been around long enough to be a Phoenix (moving) Landmark.  When I moved here they were on 32nd Street between Shea and Cactus.... Now, after a couple of new openings and a couple of moves, they have 3 locations.  I have to admit, I like the newest location the best.  They have moved to Paradise Valley Mall and have a great spot there.  They have access from inside the mall, as well as their own door on the outside just south of the Dillards entrance on the East end of the mall.  The new location affords them a few advantages they didn't have in their old place.  They have windows..... lots and lots of windows.  They have more space.  From the looks of it, the kitchen is larger, and they have a whole side of the place, near the outside door that is dedicated to carry-out service.  Chompies is all about east coast comfort food.... Jewish style, but they have taken Jewish soul food to a whole new place.   They have elevated the art of artery destruction by taking 3 or 4 of those familiar comfort foods and layering them to greasy carb and fat filled perfection, to create dishes that even have comforting names... like knish dish, or Sarah's Favorite, or Grandma Sadie's Meatloaf.   Where else can you get a huge potato knish, cut in half like a hamburger bun, piled high with corned beef and sauerkraut, then topped with cheese and broiled till bubbly?  There have never been many places in town where a die hard bagel fan can get a "real" bagel in all it's boiled and seeded glory.... but Chompies has always been there.  The best day to pick up bagels by the dozen is on Wednesday.  Your money goes farther on Wednesday because they sell 1 and a half dozen for the dozen price.   They have an extensive selection of bakery goods as well.  I have never preferred their baked goods other than the bagels. The baked goods all taste the same to me.  I find that odd since i don't think mandelbroit is supposed to taste the same as a black and white cookie. I'm sure someones grandma made all their cookies taste the way Chompies does.... but not my grandma.  It's all fine with me though.... The main courses and all the appetizers are soooooo good that I never have room for any cake or cookies after a meal at Chompies.

Sad to say, but I don't feel the love at Chompies anymore.  It used to be a touch of home, but prices have gone way up, and service has gone way down.  My last visit left me feeling nickeled and dimed to death.  Truth told, it was more dollared to death.  I ordered a bagel and lox plate and was given a tiny amount of cream cheese. When I ran out and asked for more..... they charged me $2.29.  They never brought my table any pickles, and they charged extra for someone's bread.  We had to flag down the waitress a couple of times.  She never stopped at our table unless we sent someone to find her.  We left having spent almost $60 for 3 breakfast entrees, and that is pretty sad.

Went back to Chompies again.  I have to say that they are the most wildly inconsistent place to eat in the area.  They make some of the most delicious food, and I will always run back to get it with the hope that it will be as good as it was 20 years ago...  They are ridiculously over priced, and if that isn't enough, they charge for beverage refills even though no one else in town does.   It isn't saying much, because this isn't a town with many bagelrys, but no one in town matches their bagels.  I'm pretty sure that if even one shop from NYC, Chicago or St. Louis decided to open a place in Phoenix, they would give Chompies a run for their money.  The table service is frighteningly bad.  I took a friend there for lunch well after the rush.  We were waiting and waiting, and waiting.  I stopped in for bagels.  They were out of almost every kind.  I settled for pumpernickel and egg bagels.   I just don't know what else to say.  I'm a little unhappy with myself for going there again when I should know better, I just keep hoping.  Maybe it's because none of the real "Chompies Family " are there anymore.  They should come back and see what has happened to their customer service.

I moved here to Phoenix from a city that is well known for it's Italian neighborhoods and Italian food.  The first thing I missed when I had been here a month or 2 was good Italian food.  There are plenty of people that have claimed they found good Italian food here or there, but when I tried it, i found the places were serving something that may have included pasta, but had nothing else in common with Italy... so now after years of searching to find really good Italian food in the Phoenix area,  I can count all the really good places on one hand...  Il Posto is one of them.  In addition, it is a very reasonably priced place with a wonderful patio.  Their eggplant parmigiana is some of the best I have ever had.  The layers of eggplant are thin and perfectly crispy before they bake the whole thing in cheese and sauce.  The pasta on the side has a wonderful light fresh marinara.  Their scampi sauce is garlicky, but not too much.... and their Alfredo is made per order with the best cream, butter and cheese.  It's so rich that I have to limit myself to a once a year thing when I order their tortellini.  For lunch, try a Caesar salad, or a paninni.  This is one place where you don't have to explain what you mean if you want a white pizza.  It's already on the menu.    The patio is well placed and has fountains and plants to keep away all parking lot noise.  The decorations are fun and endearing to people who have spent any time in NYC's little Italy.... right down to the painted Mulberry Street sign and the laundry hanging on the lines overhead.  Now, I hear they have rented the storefront that is immediately east of their place and are opening a bar called "the lounge."  I hope it will be as fun to go there as it has been to sit at the bar on their patio.  I will be thrilled to have another neighborhood hangout.

Soooo..... here's the story.  I'm in the nail salon getting a mani-pedi.  Haven't eaten since the night before because i was too damn lazy to make anything, and my friend wants to go shopping...  We decide to grab a bite and Pholicious is on the way from toes to shoe store.  We enter the empty dining room and are seated in the corner near an edge.  Weirdest mix of music i have ever heard... Christmas music and pop tunes... but it's the beginning of March.  The service is waaaaay too slow.   We I order Pho and spring rolls.  My friend orders something with pork and some other kind of roll.  I think they called it a summer roll.  Mine was good.  Hers was so bad that we split the rest of mine.  Other than the weird music and slow service, my lunch would have been ok.  If we had gone off what my friend had, I'd NEVER go back.  The service was so slow that we never had time to go shoe shopping.

My review for Pizza A Metro is long overdue... I am now a convert. I was convinced that there was no decent pizza in the Phoenix area. I'm not a fan of Pizzeria Uno, and the wait at Pizzeria Bianco is hardly worth it. I had just figured that i wouldn't be eating pizza. Now, I am reborn into the pizza experience.  There isn't much in the way of atmosphere here, especially on a hot day when the tables are so close to the wood fired oven.  There aren't a lot of tables either, only about 5.  No one can eat here and claim they don't get enough attention or service... not with so few tables.    Not only is the pizza delicious, I love their pasta, and the salads are wonderful.  I've also gone for lunch and split an antipasto plate with a salad.  I don't make it there very often, but whenever I have the chance, it's one of the first places i think of.

Sooo.... this whole yoghurt "craze" thing? How is it different from any other yoghurt craze?   I thought the whole yoghurt thing started with the Dannon Frozen Yoghurt shops in the early 80s, and was made more commercial by TCBY.  You remember them... TCBY= The country's best yoghurt?  I was expectiing more from Wildberri... I hoped for decent yoghurt, and fresh toppings. The toppings weren't that great and there weren't that many options... and the yoghurt was too sweet.  I'm kinda sick of the feeble attempts at a better yoghurt.

My favorite Target store in town for many reasons...  The store is always clean.  They have a huge selection.  The grocery store has EVERYTHING.  The prepared foods/deli section can save me from cooking for days.  I love the huge selection of household storage.    The checkout is painless.  They always have a good number of lanes open so I never have to wait in long lines.  I'm even impressed with the short wait I had to return something during holiday season.  I wish they could improve the parking situation.  The lot is huge, but the store is at a narrow end where there is less parking.  That means there are plenty of spots to park, but they are all far from the door.  Good thing rain is rare.  It would make the walk to the car pretty bad.  Five stars for the store, 2 stars for the parking...

This little family run place has wonderful sushi!  The owners are Korean, but they serve sushi and many traditional Japanese dishes in addition to their own Korean Bulkogi.  I prefer their sushi and their tempura over the Korean dishes.  The sushi is well crafted and fresh.  The have a nice light tempura and several other nice dishes.  It is quite inexpensive.  I like to pick up a few rolls to share with friends  on the way home

Salvadoreño makes delicious pupusas!  Pick your filling, they are all delicious.  I like to call ahead so that they are ready when I arrive.  Cheese is my favorite.  I'm also fond of Spinach and cheese.  They have plenty of other options, and all are very nice.  The place is quite inexpensive, and very casual.

Great mother of Gumbo! Flavors of Louisiana is good homestyle cajun cookin' right here in the desert!  The food has just enough warmth to make your taste buds glow.  The shrimp are huge and juicy... so the po-boy is pure heaven. I wonder if the oyster po-boy is as good.  The Crab Landry (crab gumbo without rice, and 4 fried shrimp atop garlic bread) is amazing.  Jambalaya was tasty too.  I MUST come back on Friday or Saturday to try the seafood gumbo.   There is plenty of parking.  The dining area and facilities are spotless.   There is no table service.... just a counter.  No frills at all, just fantastic creole comfort food at a great price.

This isn't a chain, is it? It feels like a chain... it tastes like a chain... the food is just too prefab. Prefab is OK for cheap housing and fast food, but not for a place that charges about $10- $12 per person for breakfast.   Food is OK... nothing special. They have a well rounded menu with lots of options, but none are so special or so delicious that I would write home about it.   For me, it's close, convenient and fast... other than that, I would choose someplace else.

In my quest for new and wonderful places i often forget my old favorites... and i had a harsh reminder of what i have been missing last week.  Don't skip Mr Sushi.  I forgot how wonderfully fresh and delicious their sushi is.  I happened to be driving home the other day on a different route and decided to stop. The place is comfortable and i LOVE the bar.  They have tons of paper signs advertising their hottest and newest creations... the sushi staff are friendly and the patrons usually are as well.  I had a "bubba gump"  special.... shrimp, wrapped with shrimp and more shrimp...with shrimp on top.  YUM!  The Caterpillar roll is as good as any i have ever had.  One bite of the Lobster Tempura roll, and i am hooked again.  The sweet lobster flavor sent my senses off on Mr Sushi addiction.  I'm writing this review at 9 am, because if i was writing it during their working hours... i would probably put my computer away, get in the car and have sushi for breakfast.  It was that good.  seriously.  Now that I think about it, I'm probably going there for lunch.

El Rancho is a shopping experience.  The store is smaller than most, but they seem to pack in twice the amount of stuff.  The aisles are packed with all the usual groceries, and tons of imported specialties, but the real treasure in El Rancho is all around the perimeter of the store.    They have the most beautiful meats, poultry and fish.  I'm accustomed to butchers in stores and did not appreciate how, in Phoenix, most grocery stores do not have butchers.  El Rancho has butchers working there who will cut anything the way you want it.  In addition, at the end of the poultry, meat and fish counters (which are huge and spectacular) there is a section devoted entirely to Mexican cheeses... Queso Fresco, Cojito and all sorts of Mexican white cheeses.  The aroma of fresh tortillas hits you as soon as you walk in the door.  They have their own tortilla factory in the corner.  A huge bag of white corn tortillas for tacos was $1.99.  There were at least 6 different kinds of tortillas in many different sizes.  The hot foods section had at least 3 different soups, and 6 different hot dishes.  They also had a cold counter that had fresh cut fruit, salsa, fruit cocktails and at least 6 kinds of fresh juices.  I can't remember all of them, but I do remember that one was watermelon.  They all looked delicious.  The bakery was filled with heavenly looking pastries and cakes.  They also have plenty of breads cookies, and pan dulce.  The produce section was beautiful and diverse.  The counters were stacked with ripe peppers and chilies. They stock all the usual grocery fare and lots of specialty items.  They had big bags of fire roasted green chilies for $1.  It is a wonderful place, and even though they were quite busy, customers did not appear to be waiting very long for any service or checkout.  Parking is easy, and the location is good for me.  The construction on 19th Ave is a little bit of a hassle, but It's well worth the visit.

I'm a devout fan of a particular burger place in the midwest that does not exist in Phoenix.  I missed it terribly, until I had my first burger from Culver's.  Now, I can head over to Culver's whenever I feel like one of those amazing burgers.  My only challenge is choosing between a butter burger, a reuben, a mushroom swiss burger, a pot roast sandwich or any number of other delicious things on their menu.  Oh yeah, they have great frozen custard.

Noodles and Rice hooked me with their Panang Curry.  They will serve it several ways, and will customize it any way you like.  My favorite is to get the Panang Curry with Noodles.  The beef is lean and tender.... never overcooked, but it is good with chicken too.   I've tasted the Tom Ka and the Tom Gai, both excellent.  The crab rangoon is the best I have ever eaten.  It isn't like you will find anywhere else.  They add a liberal dose of pepper.  Edamame is a great starter.  On the heavier side (read that as fried) The lemon chicken and the orange chicken are fried in a light batter then served with the sauce.  Lemon is more tangy and is absolutely delicious.  I prefer the orange though because it is quite spicy.  They both tasted great.  The quality of the meat was excellent.  The fried rice is rather plain in contrast to the pungent flavors of the main courses.  That worked just fine for me.  The only thing I have tasted there that I would not order again was the hot and sour soup.  It was more vinegary than i expected.  I guess I need convention when it comes to my hot and sour.  I am so glad that I found this place.  They are very inexpensive (which earns a weekly visit from me) and the location is very convenient.

After passing this remodeled Taco Bell 2 or 3 times a day for the last month, I decided to stop.  The bright white paint and the garlands of little flags announcing the grand opening certainly got my attention.  I was hoping to find a great place to add to my list of "carryout on the way home from work."  The place is clean and the people are very nice.  I really wanted the food to be great, but it wasn't.  The food was OK, but nothing to write home about.  My egg roll was fine, but my seafood delight really wasn't a delight at all.  I threw all but a few bites away.  The fried rice it was served atop was not very tasty and altogether too greasy.  My friend had a few appetizers with dinner, all of which were tolerable, but not great.  The fried fish was good enough that I would stop if I wanted a quick piece of fish for lunch...  The fish itself was quite good, but the breading was thick and heavy.  The pot stickers were OK, but again, not great.  I also had one of their crab puffs.  That was one of the better things I tasted.  My friend also had chicken with broccoli, which was more broccoli than chicken.  Like the rest, it was passable, but hot that great.  I would stop here again.... but not to get a meal.  I would DEFINITELY stop for egg rolls or a piece of fish.    This is the kind of place that would be great as a late night after drinking stop.... get the designated driver to pull through the drive through and order a mess of inexpensive fried stuff to soak up the alcohol....  They advertise breakfast on their sign, but they do NOT serve breakfast.  I specifically asked and was told that they intend to serve breakfast at some time in the future, but have not started that yet.  I would take those other reviews that rave about the breakfast with a grain of salt.  Since breakfast has never been served here, I suspect that they are unreliable fakes attempting to drum up business.   I WOULD LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT BREAKFAST DOES NOT EXIST.  IT IS NOT OFFERED AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY INTEND TO SERVE BREAKFAST. Anyone who says that they DO serve breakfast has NOT been in the door, or is trying to get a jump on the date that they do begin to serve.  I specifically asked about the breakfast. IT IS NOT OFFERED.

Do not EVER use this locksmith.  They lie and take advantage of people.  They quoted me $25 then charged me $75.  The entire call took less than 5 minutes.  I actually timed it.  9:58 pm to 10:01 pm.  They take advantage of a person standing alone in the dark... I fully intend to file a complaint with the BBB they were so bad.  In my entire life, I have never had to do so, but with this business, I absolutely feel that I must.  If they had said that they were going to charge me $75 when I asked them over the phone, then it would be my option to call someone else, but to tell me $25, then to triple the amount when they arrive and am standing alone in the dark is a horrible thing to do.... even if the 3 min work had been worth an extra $50.  They also have other phone numbers ... DO NOT call them... Be wary if you see the phone number 800 983-0994, the number  602-633-0200 or the number 480-292-5442

Located inside the latest incarnation of the hotel at 4000 N. Drinkwater, this pub has set itself up for high expectations.  Considering the history of this hotel and the preceding restaurants, that should be expected.  They hedged their bets by bringing in Iron Chef Jose Garces and a list of available whiskies/whiskeys that is exceptional.  It's fairly pricey. I'm posting the menu in the photos.  Food is exceptional.  I'm going to save my more in depth review for a while because the first couple weeks of any business may not be the best indicator of what it will deserve once it develops a regular clientele.

I had to rent 2 weeks ago.  I shopped around and found that this location was half the price of all the other major rental places.  In addition, their insurance was 25% less expensive than the next closest competitor.  It's always cheaper to rent at a location that is not near the airport.  Enterprise will pick you up wherever you are and bring you to their location to sign for your rental.    I'm walking distance from this location, but it was very hot (over 100°F) so I had them drive the 5 blocks to pick me up.  I was assigned a new Nissan with tons of extra convenience electronics.  I didn't pay extra for nav, but I had bluetooth for my phone, a back up cam, keyless ignition and lots of other toys.  It made the rental very enjoyable.  I was ready to return the car 2 days ahead of time, and I was in Tempe at the time.  I was able to leave the car there.  There were no extra charges to do so, and it was very convenient.  The name of the game with enterprise is to be as easy and convenient as possible.

I searched high and low for a good place to take my car.  I had plenty of suggestions.  I took it to one place where they misdiagnosed the problem.... then a second where they charged me 5 times more than necessary to change a light bulb.    The third place gave me a list of repairs totaling over $700 that they claimed were "critical."  Finally, at my friend Barth's suggestion, I went to Fletchers.  They were truthful and told me that 2 of the repairs suggested by the other place were completely unnecessary.  The only thing that was REALLY needed was completed for $50 less than 2 other estimates I had gotten.  It is not easy for me to get in to Fletchers during work, and they have always been accommodating.  Today, I'm going over to get something fixed that broke yesterday.... I called in the afternoon and am headed there now.  They said it would take between 60 and 90 min to fix.  I'll let you know when I return.  ..........................................................................................................  Well, the repair took longer than expected, but that was because they had to wait for the part to be delivered.  As soon as it arrived, they had everything done very quickly.  The price was a little more than I might have gotten it elsewhere, but still very reasonable, and under warranty.  I'm a happy camper.

I had to go back to Fletchers today.  They have been consistent in giving me better prices than any of the other places I check, and always have the repair done that day.

Had to make 2 more trips to Fletchers within a week.  Both were repairs that could have been all day affairs.... instead, I was out within 3 hours on the first, and 2 hours for the second.  They had ordered the part the day before, and it was waiting when I arrived the next day.  That made everything quick and easy.  If you hate waiting in the shop, schedule after 11am and go get an ice cream at Baskin Robin's, or visit some other place in the shopping center while you wait.

Apparently, Pig N Out is the drive through version of Waldo's Bar B Que.  They have "Pig" sandwiches, pulled pork, brisket and chicken.  I had the brisket.  It was honestly, the juiciest brisket I have EVER had in my life.  It was wonderful.  There was even a little bit of burnt end in mine... YUM!  I'm not a fan of pork, but my friend said it was very good.   The potato salad was pretty good.  The cole slaw was a sweet style that is not my favorite, but it was ok.  It had way too much dressing though.  I especially liked the sauce.  It was just spicy enough with a good touch of smoke and sweet.  They served mine on the side.  I don't know if that is par for the course or not because my friend ordered hers on the side, but it was DELICIOUS.    The meats were perfect.... and that's why you go to a BBQ place, right?   That combined with excellent sauce and the really good prices earns Pig N Out more of my business.  It's nice to see an old taco stand being put to good use.

Very cheap quick lunch.  The sushi is about par with grocery store sushi.  It is mostly surimi salads and surimi sticks, and is a little bit on the dry side. It's nice to have an alternative to the usual food court fare, so it isn't a bad option, just a different option.

Still the best places around!  They had to change the name because of a copyright in California.  They sure didn't change the food though.  It is excellent.  There are 5 choices of meat, maybe more.... and legit vegetarian choices.  You must try this place. I wish they were open later.

If this is street food, then I have been visiting the wrong streets when I am in Mexico.  The ample portions of food here are fresh and tasty.  There is something on the menu to please all appetites.  Small appetites have as many options as large, and almost everything can be prepared as a vegetarian dish.  In addition, those who do not eat gluten can substitute Jicama for the tortillas.  Yes, that's fresh, sweet, crunchy Jicama.    They serve salads, tortas, tacos, tostadas, and burros all day.  They have a breakfast menu of egg tortas and egg burritos too.  The front case is filled with pan dulce, churros, angel wings, crescent breads, galletas, pasteles and a version of an Italian cream filled horn.  The price on these little pastries can't be beat.  Most were 50¢ with the most expensive in the case at 99¢.  The fancier deserts were in a case next to the register.  They had tres leches cake, and 4 kinds of flan.  They also had large cups of fresh strawberries, and Mexican sodas.  Another case was filled with frozen fruit bars and mounds of ice cream.

Try their twice fried noodles or mushu.  They do a great job, and they make it any way you like.  This isn't a restaurant as much as it is a food stand.  It's more like a food truck that never had wheels.  Good Taste House added online ordering which makes it even easier to get food delivered.  They use food 24 online ordering, and the prices are not marked up.  One more reason to never go hungry.  Did I mention that the woman who works there (may be the owner??) is also incredibly sweet and kind?  I always prefer to give my business to people that are nice to me.

My new favorite restaurant.  They have 22 different fish dishes ranging from $16-23, at least a dozen different kinds of pizza slices ready for you to pick out of the case, soups, salads, and 15 kinds of pasta that they will serve with any of 4-6 different sauces.  The food is so yummy!  I rate it 5 stars because the menu is huge, it fits a niche market that is in need of more restaurants, the people are warm and friendly, food is all freshly prepared but the wait is not long, and it is reasonably priced.

A friend and I decided to try Thai Basil the other night.  We arrived at what should have been the end of a dinner rush.  The place was empty.  There was one other occupied table when we arrived, but they appeared to be employees eating after their shift.  The place looks nice, but the booths are uncomfortable. The seats feel more shallow than standard sized seats.  The service was acceptable, but not great.  I was unhappy with my dish, and the server did not offer to adjust or change it.  I ordered a masaman  curry, which is usually very mild compared to other curries.  This was not mild at all.  It was so spicy that I could only eat about half a cup.  Masaman curry is supposed to be made with coconut, cinnamon, lemongrass, ginger, cloves and other sweet strong spices.  My dish tasted exactly like a panang curry.  Masaman is coconut based, and panang is peanut based.  They should not taste the same.  The dish was flavorful, but not the right flavors for a masaman curry.  I'm certain that my friend enjoyed the signature dish more than I enjoyed mine.  She also only ate a small amount and took the rest to go.  Dinner with a shared appetizer, beverage and dessert will cost close to $30 while lunch specials will bring the meal price down closer to $15
