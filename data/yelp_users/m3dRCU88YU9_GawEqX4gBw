Wow! Just left Apple with a new phone and I could not be happier!  Such a great experience compared to dealing directly with Verizon.  The employees were welcoming and friendly and helped me solve my iPhone problem quickly!

Wow! I just had a great tv repair experience at Melrose Electronics. The owner, Richard, is knowledgeable and friendly. We took our tv in because it was not turning on. He gave us a quote (and by quote I mean an amount far under what 3 other establishments had offered) and then fixed the tv within 2 days! Wow! Great, old fashioned repair shop that doesn't haggle or hassle customers. I will return here 100%!

I hate to leave a terrible review for a restaurant in our neighborhood, but unfortunately, the following is what they earned. We drive by Thirteen North often as it is located near our home. We love to eat local and tried this restaurant once many years ago, but for whatever reason never returned.  More recently I noticed they were offering Groupons, so I made a mental note that the establishment may be struggling and that we should go in and support our neighbors.  Big mistake. Upon entering (myself, Husband, and 3 year old daughter) we were walked toward a 2 person table and offered a high chair. Possibly the hostess has never had children...possibly?...so I kind of understand why she may have thought that a 3 year old will sit in a high chair. Mine definitely does not. We declined and she was so kind as to offer us a larger table so we could all sit in a chair.  When our server arrived we each tried to order a drink. She had no problem with my tea or Husband's water, but when we asked for milk for our daughter she replied "this is not Denny's". (WE SHOULD HAVE LET AT THAT MOMENT) We stayed and ordered our food. While waiting for our mediocre entrees to arrive, the server yelled from a few tables down that we "need to drink in unison" so she doesn't have to fill my drink and then come back to fill his later. It was most likely meant as a joke, but that is the type of thought she should not articulate. (I told her she does not need to fill mine anymore...wouldn't want to take time away from her leaning on the bar doing NOTHING). When we were finished eating (I only ate half of my pasta) she took the plates away quickly, did not offer a box, and dropped the check. We will NEVER be back.
