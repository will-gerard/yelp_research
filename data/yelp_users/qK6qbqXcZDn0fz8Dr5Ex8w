the F150 needed brakes.  we got them done in one day--ready on time, not over-charged, the day before a holiday weekend, friendly and HONEST.    plus, they've got a really cool shop dog.

That old bar smell.  This goes way beyond dive bar.  I commented to my friend about the couple on barstools, 'those two are "leaving las vegas'!"     Does any establishment need 40 taped up signs warning the would-be patron of their rules:  "NO CREDIT CARDS" --and someone wrote by hand, 'EVER'.  and "NO GUNS" and multiple "NO SMOKING"   I ate the burger and I lived, though the meat tasted old I figured it was soooooo overly cooked that I probably was safe.  ...Jesus!  I just read the review about them having cooler "problems".

I've been 4 times, my sister was pregnant and the baby needed that Pho--Lucky me!  Best Pho, ever.    Best spring rolls and the egg roll is served the right way--with lettuce to wrap around.  Also, fresh oil--not oil that's been around for 100 years--you know what i mean... *fresh*  Huge, generous portions, fresh and authentic.  Gracious and hospitable service and the prices are insanely low.  So good that I'll drive to Chandler from South Scottsdale just for a taste.  Go.  Now.  -*- After reading a couple of reviews, I have to request that anyone please *not* dine here if you can't handle Vietnamese people eating next to you--I would hate for your bigotry to ruin the experience for anyone else.  In fact, you should probably not dine anywhere outside of your home if you're so consumed with hatred for anyone of a different ethnicity.  Thanks, much appreciated!  =) -*-

Prior experience:  I've been here 3 times in the past year and a half.  The other 2 times were pleasant, there was a man working and we chatted for a few minutes, he seemed to be the/an owner.  An erudite East-Coaster, helpful, passionate about books and about suggesting and finding what I needed in the stacks.  Current experience:  So today I head over on my way home and I pulled in delighted to see that i have about 38 minutes before they close.  I spend a minute reading the notice on the door--they're moving and I'm disappointed as I live in South Scottsdale and vacant buildings are the new concept in architecture.  I digress.  I pull open the door, breathe in the trusty used bookstore scent that I love, delighted with my day as well as just about my whole damn world...  Then it begins, the screeching.  There's what appears to be a streetkidÂ® (if we were in berkeley) slouched behind the register, I wince as she screams in my general direction, YOU HAVE THIRTY MINUTES!    Okay, I've worked enough retail to know that late shoppers are a PAIN in the ass, they screw up your ability to close the registers early and getting out on time, etc.  Still.  what about a 'hey' or a 'hi' or a 'just to let you know'.  Seriously, I'm not asking for a HJ, just dish me out something polite *in addition*, if your particular brand of customer service is admonishing the would-be buyer.   I then made the mistake of going directly to her for help with jogging my memory about a book of short stories that I was interested in....  I had a partial name and was certain she'd finish my sentence with indy bookstore girl smugness, which was cool, I braced myself.  Alas.  no!  She further leaned into the computer and came up with 'no, nothing'.  To be clear, she either meant that *they* didn't have it or that it didn't exist at all, Flannery O'Connor.  I persisted, 'no...?  nothing?'  She didn't  seem invested in searching further so I asked where the 'literature' section might be and she extended her long and pale arm scarred from self-abuse and pointed in some direction that was behind me but could have also been out the window and beyond the parking lot.  So far we have LOUD, rude and indifferent  As I'm perusing I see a youngish guy come in and go up to her and ask about an author, I listened to see if she offered better service, and she did... She actually peeled herself from behind the desk and personally walked him to where he would find the author.  Though I am pretty sure she told the guy that Bukowski is going to be coming out with something new later this year.  (ha!)    The guy and her talk about how hard it is to find such an obscure writer at the library. (ha!)  In addition, 'customers who come in with lists of books' and expect her to search for them.  (what!  that sounds book-fun, to me!) I was going to interject on both counts but was feeling pretty 'f*ck it' by this point and I heard the door open and close and it was quiet again for a few moments.    Then, girl-clerk screamed again, "YOU HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES!"  To be clear, I'm standing not 10 feet from her...I consider picking up a copy of 'The Heart is a Lonely Hunter' but it's too new/doesn't have the old cover.  Then, "YOU HAVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES!"  I decide that I am not going to buy a thing even if I find the most perfect book, ever.    Back in my car, the clock on my dash says that I still have 15 minutes.  I think about what a total assault this woman is on all of the senses and I consider calling the owner, and I still might.  Edit to add:  I will still shop here, I'll just be better prepared and not expect the same kind of help that I once received.

I went with the positive reviews from here and I'm glad that I did.  My mother is visiting from San Diego and both she and I were impressed (and that's difficult in south Scottsdale because we're both fans of fresh, authentic, spicy, flavorful fare).  Great tom kai kai, pad thai and shrimp with black bean sauce.  I don't eat pork so I didn't try the raved-about eggrolls, but we did partake in the 'regular' eggrolls which were cripsy, tasty, if average.  We splurged and had the home made coconut ice cream and fried bananas (drizzled with honey and sprinkled with chopped peanuts).  Worth it.  Delicious.  A delightful experience, the owner(s) both asked if we were enjoying ourselves, warm, excellent service, comfortable booths and thoughtful dining ambiance (once inside).  Try it once and you'll find your newest favorite restaurant for an asian food hankering.

Enjoyed dinner at Tottie's last week, same great taste but the service was even better --didn't think that was possible.    one issue, i LOVE spicy--we got our pad thai at "8" and it was way too hot to eat--it was still good and we picked at it but i just think that there was some mistake.  *and* i didn't say anything because we were already getting full--i took it home and the next day added it to a ton of rice noodles and it was even better.    also, you MUST try the desserts--homemade coconut ice cream and these fried bananas.  really, to die for.

How can you not stay here when you're in Gila Bend?  Good coffee, too.  Also, bought a mug because duh.

In 2009, Sofia's was where we had our first date.  I can't remember which of us picked it but it was just right for authentic fare and lingering while getting to know a little about each other.  My partner and I felt the sparks of a kindling romance over the traditional and tasty chile relleno--we've been together, since and we're married last year.    Thank you, Sofia's.

it's so HARD doing vegetarian and dining out in arizona, of this i'm sure.  we've been to Udupi a few times over the past few months (and taken my mother when she was visiting and my sister for her birthday), i was nervous the first time from reading a bad review, here--plus, it's in kind of a not-appetizing location.    that said, everything was great!  service is gracious and professional, the atmosphere is a tad 'old denny's' but the other diners are usually a cross-section of people that you could probably be stuck on an island with and no one would eat you.  (random i know, but this one time we were there and this cool young couple had a baby and friends at their table and you could just tell they were all very loving people.  -sorry for the woo woo!)  the place smells good, and the food is fresh and authentic.   i love the paper masala dosai--and now i'm craving one before 9am!!

The atmosphere is cozy, hip, fun but don't expect a table for two--and you may hear conversations that you don't want to--next to us a woman had just experienced her first 'anal exam'--i'm not even making this up.  Our server was warm, knowledgeable and welcoming.    The food is TINY and amazingly delicious--Tapas, right?  well, I guess so--I just think every dish is probably about 10% priced over what each dish should be, 20% in some cases.    But that Sangria (red) calls my name--If only, like my favorite place in San Diego, it had the pieces of fruit floating in the pitcher/glass...  Still, *by far* the best Sangria I've had locally--Unless I count my own.    I am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars (plus tip) and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us, we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again, the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan.  still, we did have to listen to the lady's first anal exam-experience.  (In some company this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing...)  okay, Lola, you're getting your 4 because the Sangria/Service/Quality are just that good!

It's a large strip mall.    You have to drive to stores because if you need something on one end of the 'mall' you're not going to want to walk across the huge surface of blacktop to the other side.  But more importantly...what I seriously don't get.  People congregate at this mall on Fri/Sat night like it's a club.    You're shopping, or you've seen a movie, you walk into the main section of the mall--down by the movie theater and suddenly you've walked into a drinking and smoking, obnoxious mob of 30something party people.  Wtf?  Are the bar options in Tempe so bad that a mall-restaurant/bar is as good as it gets?  Oh straight people, I adore your quirks!!

Still not in love with it.  Again with the overstaffing and employees huddled, eating/drinking and chatting instead of hurrying up and making my drink.  it is okay to hurry--or is that just my strange, city-thinking?  meh.
