I have been getting acrylic nails on and off for about a decade and this was the best experience I've ever had! I came in with a friend and several coupons, but all the coupons were on 1 sheet of paper. The coupons stated that each was not valid with any other offer, and though we were 2 people I was unsure if they would each let us use a coupon. My nail technician, Eric, simply cut out my friend's mani-pedi coupon and cut out my acrylic coupon and handed me back the rest. Not only was the atmosphere of this place very nice, but the technicians were lovely as well. The technician that did my nails was friendly, kind, listened to what I wanted and even made suggestions & offers, managed not to hurt me or be too rough while doing my nails, and he gave me the best acrylic manicure I've ever gotten. I truly enjoyed my experience here and I would return to Eric for another manicure in a heartbeat. How nice to go to a nail salon that makes the experience a pleasure vs a chore!!!!!

This has to be the best Indian food I've found in Az!!! The Tandoori chicken was incredible as was the bit of lamb korma and chicken tikka masala that others in my party ordered and I tried. The staff was also competent and very understanding, (seeing as how a member of my party was almost an hour late). I really enjoyed my meal at Star of India and I plan to return, repeatedly!!!!

Shimogamo has absolutely wonderful sushi!!! This has to be one of the best places to get sushi in Phoenix. Shimogamo has very fresh sashimi, some interesting rolls, and a nice sake list. This small restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere and competent servers!!! What's not to love at Shimogamo?!?!?!?!?!

I got a fill and a gel manicure here. I didn't need an appointment to get right in on a Wednesday, which was nice. I think the lady who did my nails did a pretty good job, but she kept pushing me to get glitter on my nails, which I wasn't very into. In the end I decided not to and figured out that the price of my service would have been $10 more had I gotten the glitter. I understand the need to make sales in any customer service industry, but one should utilize a little delicacy when trying to make a sale. My manicurist was just a little too pushy for me to be comfortable, even in she did an alright job.

I went here last night and enjoyed my meal. Their happy hour menu( though not extensive) had some decent selections, and wasn't too pricy. The sushi was good; I and my group enjoyed the salmon and yellowtail sashimi, the orgasm, some nigiri, and some cooked food. The only things I wasn't that fond of was the the spicy salmon roll, (I hate it when sushi restaurants drizzle spicy mayo on the top) and my halibut nigiri was too tough. The sake list was ok and during happy hour I saw that they do sake bombs for like $5. One of the things that really impressed me was the prompt, attentive service and how quickly the food came out, (hence the 4th star). All in all, I think this place is worth returning to if I'm in the area.

I have to come to Phoenix a couple times a month and after discovering this Springhill Suites, it's  the only place I stay. The location is AMAZING, (walking distance to the mall, restaurants, etc) the rooms are clean and extremely comfortable, the staff is marvelous, and they offer a complementary breakfast every morning as well as free wifi. I love staying here and as long as i have to make frequent trips to Phoenix, this is where I'll be staying!!!!!!

This inexpensive & casual restaurant has great food!!! I didn't mind ordering at the front and then taking my seat, considering the very reasonable prices. My mother had the kabob plate and I had a gyro, we also shared baba ganoush with their homemade bread. We liked everything except the steak kabob, though the chicken kabob was excellent. They also had a machine that poured over 100 types of soda, which allows anyone who doesn't drink soda to enjoy things like seltzer. This restaurant is a convenient choice for those looking to have a modestly priced, not to mention delicious meal.

This is the BEST place for dim sum in Az. One of the most exciting parts is that they don't only serve dim sum on the weekends. They have great tea, fabulous Chinese broccoli, and MANY other dishes that are very fresh in spite of coming to you via the traditional carts. I always recommend coming here if you are looking for dim sum in the Phoenix area!!!!

I am stunned that this place has any negative reviews!! The staff is so pleasant and will answer any questions you have with a smile. When you check in they give you a free goody bag with snacks, as well as popcorn in the afternoon and cookies in the lobby every evening for all!!!! The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds, a nice tv and sofa, and a small kitchen that has all the amenities including a full-sized fridge and freezer!!! There are enough outlets to plug your electronics into, (a constant issue in hotels that has me doing things like unplugging the phone or lamp). Also the air conditioning works marvelously, which is important because its currently 110 degrees outside!!!!! There is complementary breakfast from 6-9 on the weekdays or 6-10 on the weekends. I was not expecting a great hotel, due to the inexpensive rate I got, but I was so pleasantly surprised! Since I have to come to Phoenix on a regular basis, I am very excited to have found this gem and will be returning often!!!!!!

I liked this Fairfield Inn. I could find nothing wrong with it. It was a clean room with a bed and all the things a person could need. However, if you are looking for a Marriott property to stay at for a similar price on average, The TownPlace Suites Phoenix North is only about 4 miles away and it is much nicer. For the same price you can enjoy better rooms, better customer service, and basically a better everything.

I have not been to a Denny's in many years and now I remember why, however this is an Az Shuttle pickup location, so I decided to grab some breakfast seeing as how I was early for my shuttle. However now I regret eating here seeing as the food and service were awful. My turkey bacon was very oily and soggy and though they did put butter on my toast, they only remembered to do so on one of the slices. I prefer cream cheese to butter so I asked a passing waitress for some and she informed me that they didn't carry cream cheese. What kind of breakfast place doesn't have cream cheese? So I asked for a bit  more butter, but I never got it. Lastly I had my credit card out on top of the check for around 20 minutes, trying to get my waitress' attention, but I never managed to. In the end I just threw some cash on the table and ran outside when I saw the shuttle pull up. I rarely write negative reviews, but I was completely astounded by how bad EVERYTHING was at this Denny's.

I love Roy's! This restaurant has great fish and steak as well as an extensive wine list. I was also REALLY excited to see that they have an entire gluten-free menu! GO ROY'S!!! I've been to this restaurant a few times and I have always been extremely impressed with their servers and hostesses. Roy's is a place I go on a night I'm looking to celebrate something and enjoy a nice time with friends or family.

Finding good Korean food is really difficult in AZ, however Korean BBQ is consistently good. The interior certainly isn't fancy, but I care more about the food than the ambiance on an average night. The Kimchi and other side dishes are very tasty, (the kimchi's spiciness isn't dialed down for American taste buds) the Jap Chae is absolutely delicious, and I have never been let down by their Gal Bi. They have Soju that is worth drinking as well as a couple Korean beers and you can always ask the extremely friendly waitress or owners for a recommendation. I have been to Korean BBQ many times in the past and intend to return in the future.

Hana probably has the freshest sushi in Phoenix. They always have specials posted above the sushi bar and what they serve regularly is beyond delicious as well. It is BYOB, but they open it for you and how good the food is MORE than makes up for such a minor inconvenience, (if it could even be considered inconvenient). The service is always polite and prompt as well. I love Hana Sushi and my only wish was that it was closer to my neck of the woods!!!!

A simple little Thai place in Anthem, not to mention a good place to stop by on the way out of Phoenix toward Northern AZ. The Pad Se Ew was good and the service was fine, however the prices were great!!! I was thrilled to get a good lunch for such an inexpensive price. Next time I'm passing by, I will come back to try some of the other extremely well-priced dishes!!

Thai Paradise is incredible!!! I was shocked at how good it was since it's a tiny little place in a strip-mall, (never judge a book by its cover or a restaurant by its less than fancy ambiance).  The service was friendly, capable, and fast which makes this a great place for lunch, not to mention the lunch specials come with soup.  The Saytay Chicken was tender and flavorful, (though I have had better peanut sauce) and the Pad See-Ew was the best I've had in all of Phoenix!!!!!!!!! Fast service, delicious food, and a great price, what more could you ask for?

I went to Sandbar the other night and I had a good time. My friend got off work at 10:30 pm so we had to find a place that would stay open a little later. We enjoyed Sandbar. We had drinks on the outdoor patio, played ski ball inside, and had fun both talking to the servers and customers. The martinis I had were strong but well done and the service was prompt and courteous. I'd go to Sandbar again because I enjoyed the drinks and had fun there.

I will never return here. I don't have high hopes for Korean food in Az, but this restaurant fell far short of even my lowest expectations. The service was terrible and the food was even worse, not to mention both my mother and I felt sick later that night after eating here. There are better Korean restaurants in Phoenix if you get a hankering; no need to go here.

I absolutely adore Chompies!!! They have such delicious sandwiches and a wide variety of other food. It's so great that they bring you complementary pickles while you wait for your lunch and they have a good section of more difficult to find sodas like root beer or cream soda. I have never been disappointed by the service I have had in the restaurant, and if you are looking to take something home like bagels or pastries, they also have a good sized bakery. Great food & great service, what more could you ask for?

Yellowtail has great sushi for AZ!! Their fish was quite fresh and the sashimi presentation was beautiful. They had many unique rolls and several sake options. My server was quite attentive and she took excellent care of her customers. The prices weren't too high for the quality, thus I plan to return the next time I'm in the area.

What a cute little bar. It almost has a speakeasy kind of feel. The bartender/server was great and his recommendations on beer were really helpful since that is a subject I am less knowledgable on. I even got to try a mini stein of beer, which was a lot of fun!! I highly recommend coming here and enjoying the different wine options as well as some great beers on tap or by the bottle! There are even some great little food options!!!!

I am bewildered by Seksun's good or even decent reviews. It was right around the corner from where I was, so I came here for lunch. I ate the sushi off the conveyer belt (though there was only rolls, edamame, and desert on it) but I didn't enjoy it. The rolls come around with only three pieces, which would have been nice because I could have tried several things, if there had been any variety of sushi or if it had been edible. I tried the Flash Star Roll, and it just tasted off. Then I tried a Spicy Tuna Roll but I couldn't even finish it due to the fishy flavor. The rice was also very gummy. In the end, I thought I would be safe with the edamame, but even that tasted like it had sat around for ages. I immediately got the check and left hungry. The server was prompt with my bill, but I was one of only two tables in the restaurant that was occupied. My bill was less than $7 but I would never come back here considering the other and far better sushi options in Chandler.

I enjoyed Ginban Sushi a great deal though I've only been there once. I split some nigiri, some sashimi, and a Spicy Girl Roll with another person and I enjoyed it all. The sashimi & nigiri was fresh, the Spicy Girl Roll was delicious, and another fabulous part of the dinner was the price. Having eaten in many of the sushi restaurants in the Chandler area, I can say that most are not as good and twice the price. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was the unimpressive sake menu and the unpleasant service experience.  Our server knew nothing about sake and when I asked her which Specialty Roll she would recommend, she stated that she disliked raw fish and didn't really eat sushi. I'm rather sure that my mouth hung open for a few seconds after hearing that from a waitress in a sushi restaurant. All in all, I'd return to Ginban Sushi because I liked the sushi and it didn't break the bank.

I went to Harumi Sushi a few days ago and I absolutely loved it! I thought that the fish was very fresh tasting and though I could have wished for a better sake menu, I couldn't have wished for better service or pricing. They had gluten-free soy sauce on request and for only 20 cents a packet, the service was quite attentive, and the sushi chef came to our table to see how everything was and even how spicy I wanted  my Tuna Martini, (which was actually my favorite dish that I had). Harumi Sushi had excellent service and food, as well as generous portion sizes without the gargantuan prices.

I wish I could write a negative star review. This was probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Upon checking in, I asked for a 12pm check out rather than an 11am check out. The front desk guy was so uninterested in helping me, he just told me to call the front desk in the morning and ask. He had a very, "don't bother me" attitude. When I called in the morning at around 8am, the front desk lady also had an attitude and it took me telling her that I needed the later check out for a medical reason for her to finally let me check out at noon, (and she acted like she was doing me a HUGE favor). The hallways were dark, creepy, and with scuffed walls. There was trash sitting in the halls as well. There was a vending machine on my floor that just had "out of order" scribbled on it in sharpie. Lastly, my room was gross. It was dirty with a few pistachio pieces on my bathroom floor and stains on the carpet and walls. The one positive thing I could say is that the air conditioner worked well, which is important in Phoenix. I highly recommend NEVER staying here. If you have to pay a little extra and stay at one of the near by hotels, DO IT!!!!!!!

I went here on Wednesday completely unaware that it was ladies night which makes drinks and glasses of wine 1/2 off. It would be rather pricy though without the  1/2 off.  For example: the cheapest wine flight is $21, but they do special promotions many nights. Tuesday is wine tasting and Thursday is 1/2 off bottles night. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were attentive and fun. They changed out my wine glass every time I ordered a different wine. I have no other word for the caprese than PERFECT; the balsamic reduction was fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whenever I'm up in Phoenix, I am definitely coming back. I can't wait to try out their wine tasting.

I LOVE Stingray Sushi, so I was really thrilled to see that it had moved far closer to my father's house! It was so easy to make a reservation through Yelp and I was very pleased with our table. Their Cucumber Wrap Maki selections are so fabulous, and I really enjoyed sharing a sashimi plate with the people I came with. Also our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable; we never found the service lacking, (she even kept returning to pour our sake in an effort to help us avoid the bad luck of pouring our own)! With such great food and service, this might become my go-to sushi place in Phoenix; now I just have to come back for their happy hour!!
