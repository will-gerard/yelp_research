Okay, so I should have had a better idea of what to expect, but I suppose my expectations were too high. I started out with a Cesare salad, which was just an average salad; nothing really special about it. I then got my entree, which consisted of 5 shrimp,  5 duck breast medallions,  5 fillet mignon medalions, and a few pieces of potato, broccoli,  and mushroom. It was a TINY dinner! Like, I've seen kids meals that were bigger than what I received for what would have been $40 if I hadn't had a groupon. Still though, I wouldn't even pay half price again for what I received for my meal. And I didn't even think that my meal was extraordinary! If it had been amazing, then I could see the reasoning for their outrageous prices,  but it's just not worth paying those prices just to have your own cooking pot at your table. The only reason that I'm giving them 2 stars is because the staff were all really nice and attentive.

El Norte√±o is one of those hole in the wall places that you can just look at and know that they are going to be the best Mexican food that you've had in a while! I got the carne asada chimichanga and it was sooo good! It came with beans and rice too and all for only $8.50! I'll definitely be back.

Maxim was a quaint, little, mom and pop restaurant that served good food and served it up quickly! I ordered the pho with sliced beef and it was scrumptious and in front of me about 5 minutes after I ordered it! My friends and I got there a bit late, after normal dinner hours, so it was pretty empty, which was great because I'm not always a fan of noisy, crowded restaurants. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I have to be really impressed to give a restaurant 5 stars and I just wasn't. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but I've had better pho at nicer places, so 4 stars it is!

I have seen Dr. Patel several times and I always feel that he just doesn't care about me. His office is also an Urgent Care office, so he always has walk-in patients. I feel that he just tries to get to the next patient (and his next payment) as soon as possible. I spend more time with his nurse taking my vital signs than I do with Dr. Patel assessing my health.

I went to Lux for brunch with some friends and the food was pretty good. First off, the line was REALLY long, which is both good and bad. Bad, for obvious reasons, but good because it tells you that they are popular, which would usually hint at the quality of the food you will eventually consume.   Second, they are kind enough to get drink orders while you wait in line so that you can start having your coffee, tea, juice, or whatnot, while you wait for your food. Third, the decor of Lux was cool enough to distract me while my friends and I waited for our breakfast to be prepared. Lots of retro-looking lamps on the tables combined with art from local artists made for a warm and welcoming atmosphere.   When our food did arrive, we were all satisfied! I got the Aunt Gladys's homemade salsa over four strips of tender belly bacon, three scrambled eggs, white cheddar, and hash, which was pretty delicious. My two friends also really enjoyed their meals. I'm giving them 4 stars because I did think that their food was a bit over-priced for what you got, both in portion size and quality. I mean, it was $5 for a glass of orange juice... Other than that, I was very satisfied with the experience.

I went to OHYA with my boyfriend, mostly because I like Japanese and Korean food and they serve both!  I decided on one of the specials that included a meat choice and 2 regular sushi rolls or 6 nagiri. I got the bulgogi for my meat choice, then s spicy tuna roll and a California roll. We also ordered the vegetable tempura as an appetizer.  Everything I put in my mouth that night was super yummy! I hadn't had any Asian food for a while and OHYA really hit the spot!  Just writing this review made me crave them, so I'll definitely be going back again soon to try some other wonderfully sounding option on their menu!

I had taken my computer to Jeremy a few times, previously, but both time the problem was discovered during his diagnostic test and he didn't charge me. This time, he had to fidget with my computer for a bit to fix it, which he did within a few hours! I got my computer back the same day and on a Saturday even! Jeremy is very affordable because he works out of his home, so he doesn't charge extra to cover the overhead from having a rental space! I highly recommend 2J Tech!

I have been to Papa Joe's Fish-N-Que only once, so I have only had a few things off of their menu to eat. Having said that, I don't feel that I can give as extensive of a review as I normally would. I got the pulled brisket sandwich, sweet potato tater tots, and jalapeno hushpuppies and everything I put in my mouth was delicious! The atmosphere wasn't that great, but I don't really go to restaurants for the atmosphere (and besides, I got my order to go anyway). I definitely plan on going back as soon as I can (I'm a poor grad student with very little free time) and I plan on ordering something else off of their wonderful-looking menu!

I went to Pita Jungle for a few reasons. First, I like Mediterranean food,  a lot! Second, they have a happy hour that includes $2 margaritas and tapas. We got pitas, olives, shrimp, and some sauces. We also got margaritas,  of course.  Everything was delicious and pretty reasonably priced. Nothing outstanding about them though. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back, but it was good enough.

It was my first time going to Standup Scottsdale and I had a great time! The first few comedians were...not so funny, but they got progressively funnier as the night went on and by the 4th comedian I was laughing quite a bit. It's a nice, little establishment and I will definitely be going back :-)

I had been wanting to try Joe's Philly Steak & More for a long time, but my husband is vegetarian, so I'd been waiting for a good opportunity to go. Finally, my husband was away for the weekend and Joe's had a Groupon, so I decided that this was my chance. I got the Super Steak sandwich with steak, grilled onion, peppers, and mushrooms and Provolone cheese. I got the smaller size sandwich so that I wouldn't feel too guilty about getting a side dish too... I got the Joe's Potato with steak, grilled onions and cheez whiz.   The sandwich and the baked potato were both excellent! The salty meatiness of the steak combined with the savory grilled onions and peppers, added with the grilled mushrooms and creaminess of the Provolone made for a wonderful taste combination! The baked potato was also a great choice. I was not too full, but very satisfied. It was warm and comforting and I would recommend Joe's Philly Steak & More to anyone who loves meat! Plus, they are open Monday thru Saturday until 9 pm, so you can get a late dinner if you want to.
