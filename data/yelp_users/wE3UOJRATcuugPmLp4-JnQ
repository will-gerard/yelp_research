Best cheesesteaks I've had since I left the Northeast.  Love the food, but the tables could be cleaner--hard to do though with that much greasy cheesesteaky awesomeness floating in the air.

They can't decide if they want to be a cheap buffet, or slightly more upscale Chinese restaurant.  They've got the cheap Chinese buffet quality that I love so much, but not the cheap prices to match.

I love AJ's. A great stop for those who appreciate some finer fare, but they also stock some more standard items.   Their meat and produce are consistently excellent.  Their prepared foods are wonderful--a great place to grab lunch, or even dinner for the family.  I love the sushi bar, but they will also make you a fresh sandwich, or you can take advantage of the soup/salad bar, or hot foods.  Between the excellent bakery and the helpful staff in the wine area, AJ's is always my pre-dinner-with-friends stop.

I've ordered twice from this location recently at different times of day, and not only was the estimated delivery time unusually long, but my pizza arrived nearly 30 minutes late both times.  The pizza itself was ok.

From my purchase experience over three years ago, to my most recent maintenance visit today, I have consistently been very pleased with the service I have received from Lunde's Peoria Volkswagen.  Their service has always been clearly explained, promptly completed, and reasonably priced, and on more than one occasion between myself and my extended family, they have gone the extra mile to give consideration themselves or in cooperation with VW corporate to cover repairs that were outside the warranty period.

Service was slow and inattentive, and I did not enjoy the food. Ambiance is nil. I would not eat here again.
