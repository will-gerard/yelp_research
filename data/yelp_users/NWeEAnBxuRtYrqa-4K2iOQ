Very disappointed with this dental office. I've never done business with a company that feels sending 9 forms of notifications for one appointment. The dental office sent me 4 emails, 3 text notification and two phone calls regarding my appointment today. I've never been a no show so don't understand why they would have notify me so much about my appointment. On top of that I took time off  from work to make this appointment and 10 min past my appointment I was told it won't be much longer before they see me and call me by someone else name. They didn't acknowledge me by my real name and they are the ones late for my appointment after all the efforts they sent to make sure I attend my appointment. In addition no one apologized for one being late to see me and blamed the home office for all the notifications. I was done with them. I will not refer anyone to them and share my customer experience to everyone I know family and friends and post my experience in all my personal social media outlets because that is how annoyed I am with this dental office.

I've been wanting to visit this place for some time. Always pass by it and finally did today and it was sooo worth it. I know these Mexican food places are hit & miss in the north valley. There salsa bar was great. The hot salsa is very flavorful impressive. I knew this place would if been pretty good when I saw a grandma in the back cooking. I had two tacos rice a beans. There tacos were shredded beef tacos and the beef was pretty good and the rice was true Mexican rice. The beans were a little salty but still pretty good stuff the cashier guy was supper friendly and the restaurant was very clean and authentic for being in a strip mall. Go check it out! I'm picky about my Mexican food and this place was pretty good. I like to see them around long term so go visit!

This food truck is amazing! The food keeps you going back for more. Who knew a hot dog can be so good. I been ordering the Lady and just can not get enough. It has fried pickles on it and a spicy sauce. All these flavors really mesh well together. Cant wait for my next visit! Go check them out!

If you guys like frozen yogurt you might wanna check out Yoppi Yogurt. I had some time to kill today so thought I would try Yoppi Yogurt. Just opened off the 101 fwy and Thunderbird in the West Valley. First they had free WiFi so I brought my laptop and started working a little bit and people watched too. Traffic was steady. Now to the yogurt! There are 12 flavors and they change every week. I had the Peanut Butter Yogurt tasted just like a peanut butter shake. All the yogurts are low fat but the toppings are not, Duh! Great place to bring the family, great music playing, nice and cool and they are open till 10 pm every night. Yogurt price is based on weight, $.39 cents an oz. Pretty reasonable. I'm not a huge fan of frozen yogurt but this place is a must to visit. It is less expensive than Cold Stone for those looking for a budget friendly place.   Check it out! 101 fwy and Thundered, north west corner next to Chase Bank.
