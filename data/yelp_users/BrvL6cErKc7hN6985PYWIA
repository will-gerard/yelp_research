Tortillas are always stale. Pizza is always either raw or burnt. On several occasions i have found that the staff had placed a new time label over another to avoid cooking fresh pizzas.  The quality of the food at this location just always seems to be sub par. I have lived near this location for ten+  years and its always been the same. So i go to the brown and mesa dr location

Samis is just great.  you get what you pay for. and that's a Quality meal for a fair price. portions are plentiful and it's a Clean environment    Sami the Owner is frequently on site and ready to make sure you enjoy your dining experience. The staff there is also Just as attending as the Owner.  This is why i frequent Sami's at least once a week.

First visit to Wendy and I have to say it was excellent.  She was very attentive to my comfort level with the environment and the massage. Consistent pressure, consistent coverage of desired areas I asked to be worked and great prices.  I will be back!
