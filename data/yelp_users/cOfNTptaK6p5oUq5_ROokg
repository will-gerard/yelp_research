I'm straying from my usual restaurant reviews, but I think Yoga Pura merits kudos for sure. After three classes, I think it's time for a full blown review.   First of all, Yoga Pura is a wonderful place to experience classical yoga and also dabble into the faddish "power" / "flow" yoga that seems to be all the rage these days. It's a lovely studio with a great, calming vibe, and oddly enough a great place to meditate.  The two teachers I've worked with with so far: Rachel (in Essential Basics) and the studio owner Yogi E (in Classic I/II) are wonderful. They are so very patient with beginners (myself included) and work very hard to make sure that you get the most out of your practice. They see when you're getting into trouble and help with props and helpful advice. Also, the yoga that is taught here goes beyond superficial stretching exercise, it goes much deeper, and is something that I've taken out into the world and complements my Buddhist practice very well.   One thing that also merits a lot of kudos is the traditional integrity of the teachers at this studio. They are committed to yoga as a path of personal transformation. As we Buddhists would say, they've got the blessings of their lineage. And I would say, they do represent their lineage and tradition well.   Their prices are also more than reasonable ($89 / month membership with unlimited yoga classes), and the staff and atmosphere are very friendly.   I'm proud to be the Yelp Duke of Yoga Pura.

First, overall impressions are very good. This is a nice, simple, hole in the wall. It's a simple, friendly introduction to Vietnamese cuisine. It is what it claims to be - a "Vietnamese Deli". You order at the counter and your food is brought to you.   I had the Beef Pho which had a very nice broth (once I added the requisite amount of chili sauce - personal preference) with tasty meat and rice noodles. The amount of meat was a bit skimpy, but ok. My friend had the chicken salad which was basically a salad topped with grilled chicken meat, which was accompanied by a very tasty dressing. I had a nice green tea with pomegrenate that was very tasty. Didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee as I didn't want to have a particularly late night. This is a place I'd come back to for a simple meal before or after a movie at the nearby Harkins Scottsdale 101.   Some of the possible negatives are price (a bit high, but heck it is Scottsdale, and the rent must be a small fortune at that shopping center), and the lack of choice.   Grades (a new tradition in my reviews)  Overall:  B  (there is only one grade for food, and nothing meriting an                        overall grade reduction) Service - No Grade - as there is no real table service here. Folks at the                  counter were nice though Food -     B - Above average. Good, fresh, simple Vietnamese food,                   albeit overpriced.  Drinks -  No Grade - as I didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee, and                 no alcoholic beverages are served here.

Zinc Bistro is an interesting French brasserie style restaurant. They clearly went out of their way to give it a French feel with the interior decor. We had reservations, and were seated at a nice table in the back near the kitchen. We had a team of two servers (apparently they were training a new one), which was fine. Both very sociable.   I ordered lamb shanks, and my mum ordered the scallops. To start we had the Zinc House Salad, which we asked to be split, and they did into two places (plus points for this). We ordered wine with dinner (I had a Bordeaux and mum had Vouvray), both our selections. The food was excellent. My lamb shanks were tender, and had a very tasty sauce. The scallops were also very tasty and the sauce it was in was very good.   As we were dining, mum noticed that the banquette was dusty. We could see this because the sun was just at the right angle. This was a major issue at the prices we were paying for this meal, and really is a ding that this restaurant could have easily avoided (by dusting the banquettes daily??).   Positives:  Great food, good service, nice atmosphere and decor.  Negatives: Price, dusty banquette.   Grades  Overall:  B-   (This would be a "B+" however, the dusty banquette merits                        a grade reduction)  Food:     B    - It was great food, but the prices were a little steep.                        The menu was also fairly limited.   Drinks:   A-    - Good selection of wine here mostly French / Italian,                         and pricing is good. Beware though, no cheap wine here.  Service  A-     - Our servers were social, and very nice. Formal table                           service akin to France. Plus points to our server for                          not recommending just the most expensive things on                           the menu.

Went to the store with an appointment (they even took a re-schedule the same morning). I initially came in to replace only two tires. Then the friendly tech showed me that my other two tires were coming apart at the sidewall on the inside (a major safety issue). The waiting room was clean, and the staff were very polite and friendly. I ended up spending more money than I planned to, but otherwise I would have been at risk of a bad blowout.   Great experience!

The drinks here are great, and the baked goods are even better. There is a nice ambience about the place, lots of nice furniture. I love how the baristas make the lattes and cappucino's beautiful. The owner, Jeff, is also a great guy who's around quite a bit. The only criticism that I have of it is that the place is small and if you're coming out on the weekends, you need to get there before 8:30 AM otherwise there will be no place to sit.

This is a great place for a cuppa joe and working on your laptop. What I like about this place is that there are power outlets everywhere. The staff are friendly, and the drinks are tasty. The only gripe I have is that they are expensive (even moreso than Lux Coffee which is also a "tax-included" place), but not so expensive that I avoid the place.

First things first ... contrary to its name, this place is not a Buffet, at least in the traditional sense. Also - Dim Sum Hours are limited, so check their website.  Three of us went to Phoenix Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday and enjoy a nice Dim Sum brunch. We were promptly greeted and seated at a nice table in the aisle (which is by the way prime seating - the carts were whizzing by offering all kinds of delectable things). I was happy to find that the vast majority of customers (90% or more) were Asian and heard quite a bit of Cantonese and Mandarin being spoken, so I know this place must be close to authentic to garner this kind of "street cred" among the Asian crowd. By noon, the place was almost chock full. So point of advice, get there by 11 AM to get a good table and avoid a wait.   The Dim Sum on offer was overall very good, very tasty. The skin items (dumplings) were very good, and the pork buns were also very good (though a little bit more pork might have been a bit better). Overall the portion sizes were decent (three of most things, four of other things), and I could conceivably see one filling up here for under $10 easily, but we had a birthday to celebrate after all. The only thing that was under par was the rice noodle shrimp, which is basically a giant rice noodle wrapped around shrimp then steamed, it was just a tad over steamed. I had a nice rice congee with Chao Quay (fried bread), which reminded me of Indonesia (we called it Chakwe there - almost the same thing) ... oh the memories... but I digress.   Service was prompt, efficient, and the quality was good. Staff were responsive to our questions about what things were and what they had. Also I didn't see the congee cart and asked the waitress if they had congee, she said yes and asked me what kind I wanted, and she ran over to the cart and got me my congee. Excellent service. The price was very good ... we had a total of 14 dishes between the three of us, plus tea service for me, and iced tea for one, and water for the other. The total bill was about $40 for three people, which I have to say is less than the tab for the three of us at other brunch locales downtown (though to be fair, it was quite a lot of food).   Overall, a great place for the Dim Sum neophyte. Though perhaps not the caliber of places in San Francisco or even the mecca of Dim Sum (Hong Kong), this is certainly one of the better places in the valley for Dim Sum.   Positives:  A good example of traditional Dim Sum (if not a perfect one),                  Good food, great place for groups. Good service. The place                   is also VERY clean.   Negatives:  For me this is a positive, but a due warning to Westerners with ideas of being "culturally superior" or otherwise demanding tourists:  Goinghere is akin to a mini trip to Hong Kong or even China. Be aware that eating Dim Sum is not just a different culinary experience, but also is about participating in a different culture and pace of life. Have an open mind, and above all BE PATIENT. So if you don't see the carts (or the cart you want) coming by for a few of minutes, chill out, enjoy your tea or other beverage, and relax. If you can't handle this, go to a Chinese Buffet.   Oh yes, and before I forget, GRADES:  Overall:   A- (no other demerits taken other than mentioned below)  Service:  A-  (The only major demerit on service was that the English                         spoken by some of the cart pushers was not intelligible                        however this is excusable as this is a Chinese place -                         the "specials" board was completely in Chinese)  Food:   A-  (A good example of traditional Dim Sum. Some demerits                     include over steamed Shrimp rice noodle [some firmness                    is better], the Har Gao (shrimp dumplings) were good,                     but on the verge of being over-steamed)  Drinks:  No Grade (we did not consume any alcoholic beverages, so no grade is given in this category - though I have to say my Oolong tea was delicious).

I go to Sonic so I can get my fix of tots, jalapeño poppers, and a nice sandwich of chicken. The drinks are nice too. So I pop in to this location and without explanation or apology, the young lady inside says they are not serving fried food tonight ... Anything fried ... No tots, no poppers, no chicken tenders, nothing ... I wasn't in the mood for just a burger, so I thought, hey ... those pretzel dogs look yummy, nope ... spurned again ... they hadn't thawed out any buns. No I'm sorry, no "our fryer broke down".   Sorely disappointing.

I went walking around Kierland Commons for lunch and stopped by this great spot. It was busy, and seating was very limited indoors (sitting outdoors in Scottsdale this time of year is just not worth it).   I went right up to the counter and ordered a BLT, and I enjoyed it with a Pellegrino all for just a hair over $10.00. I sat at the counter, and my sandwich arrived quickly (within less than 5-6 minutes which is great). I have to say this is one of the best BLTs that I've eaten (and no I didn't take it apart). The bacon was delicious, thick cut, and most definitely not microwaved sliver bacon like you're prone to get at other places. The sandwich had a healthy helping of lettuce, tomato, and a tasty mayo and the bread was toasted very nicely.   I also like the vibe of the place ... urban chic lunch counter without the pretension? Sounds about right. I definitely have no reservations with rating this place at five stars.   Pros:  Quick service, nice ambiance, tasty food.  Cons: Gets very busy during lunch time, but service doesn't deteriorate (which I think qualifies as a pro too)   Grades:  Overall: A  (no demerit taken on the overall grade)   Food:    A  (The famous chef Gordon Ramsay said that if you're going                     to make a simple common dish, you have to do it                      extremely well, and I think Chloe's stepped up to the plate                      and earned my "A" rating for perfect execution on this                      simple lunch dish).   Service:  A  (Excellent, efficient service with personable waitstaff that                      aren't annoying or overbearing.)   Drinks:  N/A  (Drinking on duty is somewhat a faux pas at work, so                        no booze was sampled. However, they did have a very                        good list of wines and some nice bottles of beer available                       for those who are seeking stronger libations for lunch)

I visited this salon on 7/31 to get my hair cut after a long stint of not getting my hair cut. The great experience started with booking the appointment. I had been referred by a friend to a couple of stylists. Now, get this ... one of the stylists I was referred to moved to another salon and Nicole offered to refer me to that salon if I wanted to get my hair cut by that particular stylist. Well I was basically won over. I booked an appointment with Ana (had to get the hair cut on a fairly tight schedule).   When I arrived, I was offered a drink and my appointment started on time. Ana is a great stylist who asked questions and listened to what I needed from my hairstyle. She spent a great deal of time cutting and making sure the cut was perfect. It also doesn't hurt that the conversation was good too. Ana also gave me great tips about how to style my hair and what types of product might be good for it. It was worth every dollar. It was also very enjoyable to work with a stylist that treats haircuts as a craft and not as a mechanical factory process.   The vibe and atmosphere of Snapdragon is also great. The style and design of the place is positively awesome.   Kudos to running a great salon!

Although not a place I would go for my regular sushi jones, this is a great place for dates and other such special occasions. I made reservations and was called in advance to ask if I wanted anything special on the table or if I was "celebrating anything special". Upon arrival we were greeted by the seating hostess and taken to our table.   The space is airy and trendy, someone described it as "zen" and I would agree. Very nice colors are used in the space.  Our server was a bit over-perky, but not over-bearing. His occasional attempts to get me to buy almost the most expensive thing on the menu was a bit annoying at times, but hey, dude's gotta sell. We decided on sushi, sake and tempura. All of our food was beautifully prepared and tasty, and my sake choice was delectable. Fish was fresh, did not have that "previously frozen" taste, and the rolls (Serrano Chili Hamachi Roll, Soft Shell Crab) were just excellent creations (albeit not your standard Japanese sushi roll).   All the waitstaff were extremely attentive, ensuring that our water glasses and sake cups were never empty and that our table was not cluttered. When my date left for the bathroom, they even folded his napkin for him.   Again, not a place I would go on a regular basis for sushi, but definitely a place for special occasions.

It is 8:30 PM - Amazon promised me my package by 8:00 PM Today with NO delivery at all. OnTrac's wonderful tracking service reads:  Transaction  Date / Time  Facility  REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY Jun 3 2013 8:30PM   Phoenix  UNDELIVERABLE - NEED GATE CODE  Jun 3 2013 8:29PM    Let me first say, that my phone number is transmitted to OnTrac. All the driver needed to do is call me to let me know he / she was here and had a package to deliver. It would have taken him/her a minute. But obviously this was too much trouble. Driver probably was just too tired and decided to call it a day.  A1 Courier (who Amazon formerly used for this kind of service) actually called me and said "Hi, we have a package to deliver, can you let us know how to get in to your complex?"   I'm very disappointed that OnTrac couldn't get it together to call the customer. All I can say is that my package had better damn well be at my leasing office tomorrow. If not, there will be hell to pay. Way to make Amazon look bad OnTrac.

This was a visit for a casual dinner with a couple of friends yesterday (10/21). I have to say, initial impressions are good and the place has earned the good grades.   We made reservations and were promptly seated at a nice table indoors. There was live music outside, which was piped in. It was at a good sound level. Our waiter promptly came to take our drink orders and was quite social and courteous. He did take a moment to get to know us, but not in that creepy, lingering waiter type of way. His knowledge of wine was very good and he made excellent recommendations for the dish that I had selected.  On to the food. I ordered the 5th and Wine Burger with bacon added, and seasoned fries as the side. Food quality was good. I ordered the burger medium and it came out medium. The beef was good, but did not rise to the level of quality at the Grind or DeLux Burger, though granted, unlike the other two restaurants mentioned, this one is not a burger specialist. The fries were excellently seasoned and just the right mix of crispiness and potato goodness. Overall a good presentation of a burger and fries.   Wine is the strong suit of this restaurant with a long list of "by the glass" selections and an even bigger list of "by the bottle" selections. Their breadth nicely reflects Italian, French, and American selections, however was lacking in the South African and South American vintages. I consider a good Pinotage as an absolutely necessary selection within the spectrum of reds. My Spanish Tempranillo was excellent. I have to laud the beverage service here, because the waiter knew enough to bring it out early so that it could "breathe".   The atmosphere and architecture is very nice, with great seating and interesting art on the walls. I didn't get a chance to venture outside, but it seemed very lively.   Grades:  Overall:   A-   (No demerits taken)   Food:      B    (Good presentation of a burger with good food quality,                         however, did not pass the Ramsay Test* for an "A").  Drinks:    A     (Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                          displayed by the waiter, coupled with a good selection                         makes this a great place to enjoy wine)   Service   A     (Good service as explained above)    *Ramsay Test:  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish, it needs to be executed with perfection. I will not give an "excellent" or "A" rating for a simple, classic dish unless it is executed with perfection and is a sound and creative interpretation of the dish.

This is an interesting place to be sure. It is reminiscent of a Manhattan bar or at the very least something in a bigger more cramped city. This place is neatly camouflaged in a strip mall near a Fresh and Easy. The decor was very interesting, very dark though (no natural light in this place)  I came here with a friend on a Thursday evening (another Yelper ... I'll be curious to see his review). The place was packed to the brim, which isn't really hard to do. Both of us ordered cocktails. I had the Russian Mule (vodka, ginger beer and lime juice), he had a Blueberry Hill. I didn't sample his cocktail, but mine was de-lish. I ordered the sweet and hot burger which had candied Jalapenos. The burger was huge and piping hot. My main criticism of the burger is that the burger is so big that you have to take it apart (which I do anyway - an odd deconstructionist habit, but nonetheless, I want to at least take a bite or two of the whole thing). The "herbed fries" were forgettable. Nothing special about them really. Service was efficient, and the check was split with no attitude (which is a good thing), although, the waitress was a bit slow to pick up our checks.   Overall this is a good burger place. The meat was good and tasty,the booze is good. Sides could use a tad of an improvement. I do prefer Delux Burger over this place still. At least there I can eat the burger as a sandwich (if I want to) and not as a take apart.  Grades:  OVERALL:    B-   Service:   B-    (Service was attentive, but slowness in picking up the                          check is not a plus)   Food:     B- (Burger was good, but too large, and fries were forgettable)  Drinks:  B (It's good, but not something I'd write  home about)   (just in case you're wondering - I give A's only if it's superior)

A first breakfast review ... Joe's is a great place to start. Joe's is a diner in the full classical sense: 50s period furnishings, a simple menu, and good coffee. The place was busy, which is good to see. I was greeted and promptly seated by who I later found to be the owner, Joe. I give HUGE plus points when an owner actively manages and WORKS on the floor of his or her business. Customers seem to be from a wide cross section of the community.  On to the food quality portion of the review. Breakfast food quality reviews tend to be the most blunt for me because there is not a lot of room for error. Many dishes simply involve frying or grilling, and more complex diner breakfast dishes are still relatively simple. The standard for breakfast is : simple dishes require perfect execution. Joe's rose to the challenge. It performed very well.   I ordered the #2 : 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage and 2 pancakes. I tend to order eggs scrambled soft. I like them that way, and find it a good way to test the capabilities of the cook. Unlike most places, my eggs were scrambled soft, as ordered, and, they don't use liquid eggs. Bravo! The bacon, was crisp, but not crunchy (a very subtle but important distinction). Ths sausage patties look to be hand formed, and a nice light brown shade (not the dark brown that we're accustomed to). Now, the pancakes. They were awesome. Soft, fluffy, simple, and NOT PERFECTLY ROUND (it's a good thing). All the food looked to be hand crafted and not Sysco Pancake #12345 and Sausage Patty #23456. Execution was not completely perfect, but very good. The coffee was delicious and just the right accompaniment to breakfast.   Service was good, but a bit slow. There is a good excuse. After all, it was a busy Saturday morning. Other than that, service was attentive, my coffee cup was always full, and the check was handled quickly and efficiently. All in all, a good example of simple, diner cuisine.   GRADES  Overall: A-  Food Quality:  A-        Excellent preparation of the eggs, bacon and sausage. Pancakes were very good, but didn't quite rise to the level of excellent.   Service:  B+    Yes, it was a Saturday and there were a lot of people, but service could have been a bit faster. There was a decent size wait for both my order to be taken and for food to come out. A minor defect in an otherwise great experience.   Beverage: N/A -  Drinking at 10:00 AM? No, ... I may like my booze, but 10:00 AM is way too early. Oh, and Joe's does not serve any alcohol.   Discretionary Points: The fact that the owner was there, working in his business was really inspiring to see. Nice to meet you Joe. Also the ambiance and furniture, is very 1950's diner, very nicely done!   And before someone complains - why not five stars? Well, I reserve the "Five Star" designation for restaurants that earn an overall of a "high-A" or an "A+" on my grading scale.

Like many other reviewers, I also found Jim on Yelp. It's rare to find an auto repair shop with all "5 Star" reviews. I needed new brakes and e-mailed Jim for help. Jim (the owner) was very responsive and helpful. He took a quick look and said that the damages were to the rear brakes and not the front like I thought, and he was right. He ordered the parts, and we set up a time for me to bring the car in. Car was done on time, and on budget.  Great job, Jim! Nice to find an honest, friendly car mechanic.

This is a great little deli / bodega inside of an office building. First, I have to gush about the owner, Ken. He's a very friendly and nice guy and it's great to be greeted by name (and that must be challenging given how many customers Ken has ... and he knows his regulars). But onto the nitty gritty. This is a simple "office park" type deli, but this description doesn't do it justice. The wrap I ordered today tasted great, and was put together very well.   Corridors has also catered some lunches for the place I work, and he has done a stellar job with a nice assortment of sandwiches and chips to suit almost every taste.   Altogether, a great place to get a quick bite to eat (either in, or to go). Way to go Ken, and keep up the good work.

My move in experience with Shelly (the new manager - apparently she just took over three weeks ago) was very good. She was very friendly, showed me the unit I was leasing and also how to get in the building, etc.   A couple of critiques: - They seem a little understaffed ... the door to their retail / leasing area was locked during hours (staff were out and about doing tasks on property), but they came back as promised at the time listed on the door. Another critique would be their full price. The full price for my unit at $68 seemed high, but I got a good deal during a sale, so I won't complain about that.

Like most people, I'm usually a bit nervous when checking out a new doctor or any medical provider. How will my insurance work here? Will I actually get in on time? Well, Holt Eye Care has managed to exceed my expectations.   I made an appointment 2 days in advance (I had some time off work and could, for once, get to an eye appointment at 2 in the afternoon - note: other place in Surprise were telling me 2 - 3 weeks to get an appointment during the day [i.e. not the ever so popular 7 AM or 4:30 PM appointment]).   I arrived early for my appointment and filled out all the paperwork. The front desk person (sorry ... I forgot your name), was very helpful and friendly. She did the "pre-testing" also before I saw the doctor. Great "chair-side" manner. I found out (and was rather relieved) that they don't do the "air puff into your eye" test, and for an extra $28 they do this nice "Optomap" image of your retina (no dilation). Dr. Holt, the eye doctor, has a great manner, very friendly, and explains everything to you in a way that is very easy to understand.   The frame selection is not huge (it's not a mega-corporate super chain store folks, it's a LOCAL BUSINESS owned by real people), but pretty diverse. I found out from the optical manager that she hand picks what's in stock and she did have a good eye for frames. The optical manager was also very knowledgeable about my insurance plan and explained my plan to me and what it covered and didn't and what everything would cost.   All in all a great experience. Waiting to get my glasses (they take about 2 weeks).   Keep up the good work!
