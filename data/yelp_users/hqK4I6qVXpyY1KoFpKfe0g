What a great group of guys!!  My AC stopped working in June (ugh!) and they had me fixed up in no time and for a great price.  Very knowledgeable and honest, took the time to explain everything and gave me my options.  I won't take my car anywhere else.

Forty-five minute wait on two out of four steak tacos that were ordered.. The other two weren't placed by our server, so that was another, exactly, 45 minute wait.  The first two that came out, which my husband let me have because I was starving, were so chewy and way over-cooked.  The next two tacos were burnt.  The rest of our party was also dissatisfied with their food.. One had beef sliders, so burnt and tough.  Another had the shrimp & mango burrito which was just a soggy mess.  And the beer was delivered fast but if you wanted water.. forget about it.. literally took 30 minutes after asking the guy maybe 8 times.  Will not be going back EVER!

First time I've ordered here.  Pizza was ready to pick-up (no delivery) in 15 minutes.  Was ready on time, with a very nice woman behind the counter.  The "every week customers" that were looked me up & down as if I was appying for a job.  Didn't feel very welcome but again, the employee was super nice.  Got home to check out the goods and right away I see the most grease I have ever seen on a pizza.. not necessarily a bad thing ;) my husband loves that, its just not my thing.  Once I wiped that off I noticed the crust was so thin & foldable, just like I like it.  Sauce was light, also my fave!  And the perfect amount of cheese & seasonings.  Overall, loved it!  For a 16 inch cheese pizza (see pic) with tax it was just over $14.  Slightly more expensive than the average pizza place but the pizza was better than the average pizza place too!  Will definitely be ordering from here again :)

Delicous!!  We had the shrimp & pork spring rolls (after dinner ordered another to-go!)  I got the chicken sandwich, amazing with carrots and cilantro.  Hubby got the Beef Pho, which he loved.  Heard about great happy hour specials like 2 apps & a bottle of wine for $20!  Can't  wait to go back :)

Delicious food!!!  Gave 4 stars because we showed up on a Sunday at 10 am for their brunch.  The doors were locked, sign was turned to say, "sorry we are closed" and their other sign said on Sundays they open at 11... Well their website says they open at 10 am and I was able to make a reservation.  We drove 50 minutes because I love their food and it was my birthday.  I was very upset, so we drove around for an hour.  Showed up at 11 am and when speaking to the manager found out they do open at 10 and she replied with "I was here"  when I said the doors were locked, she mentioned.. It sticks sometimes.  Okay, first of all... your door was LOCKED, I am not an idiot & your sign was turned to say CLOSED... "Oh sorry"...  besides that huge inconvience the food & service is amazing and we will definitely be back.. just not before 10:10 am just in case they're late again ;)
