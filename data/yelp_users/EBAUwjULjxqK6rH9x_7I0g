I love this place! I used to work down the street so would order take out weekly. I recommend Thai basil chicken...comes with rice and apron roll (during lunch) for approx $9.00   Fresh food, crunchy veggies, moist chicken, great and fast service! I'm sad I don't work nearby anymore

I came here on a fancy date and was def impressed. We ordered red wine, caprese and salmon. Everything was delicious and top notch. Has an upscale feel with white table cloths, live jazz music and overall atmosphere. If your looking to spend a lil and have a lovely date this is a good spot for that.

Great lunch spot with sandwiches , salads, protein bowls. Dogs are allowed on outside patio. The juices are fresh squeezed and amazing but pricey! I love the kale cleanse juice. Great place if you haven't been should def try it.

This is prolly my favorite place in scottsdale (along with jalape√±o inferno). The food is soooo amazing and have great tap beer collection. The atmosphere has a lot of character and def a cool laid back fun environment for dinner and drinks. Never disappointed!!!

I scheduled an hour massage with Casey after I was involved in a car accident that left me sore and with muscle tightness. She was so caring, made me feel very comfortable and was so sweet to constantly check with me to make sure I wasn't experiencing any pain. The massage office itself was very clean and inviting. The whole experience was such a relaxing and physically beneficial experience!  I would definitely recommend scheduling your next massage with Casey Moore!

Gross!! Delivery took forever, didn't state lunch special aren't valid on weekends so took even longer sorting out that mess. Way OVERPRICED! Worst crab Rangoon of my life,  chicken came cursed like ground beef or something, if it Wasn't for brown rice is still be dying of hunger two hours after ordering. Never again no thank u! If you want good Thai go to Thai basil!!
