I actually got a good haircut but the customer service was really bad. You've been warned.

Dr. Shahin has been my dentist for half a year. He is a true professional providing quality service in a comfortable atmosphere. They say "everybody hates going to the dentist" but going to desert palm dentistry may change your mind.

I started going to the gym since 2007 and the staff has always been helpful. It's a gym that has all the basic equipment for a good workout. I think alot of times people get caught up in the amenities such as a pool or basketball court, I know I did. However if your serious about working out then you will enjoy this gym. The prices are good, around $20 a month. Further, they have always helped me out on summer and winter breaks from school.

Ordered a green chile burrito, menudo and horchata all for around 12 bucks. Given an appetizer without asking. May have been just chips and beans but the act was thoughtful. Go to this place today!

I was looking to purchase my first home and didn't know where to start the process. All that changed when I contacted Danny and his entire Myriad Real Estate Group. From the get go, Danny sat me down in his office (nice conference room) and we discussed how to filter my search. This is important because I was able to narrow my search that was unique to my "must have" list. Through the Myriad website and other resources they provide, the house hunting search was a breeze. I was able to look at over 110 houses that were listed online. Myriad also sent me daily updates on listings so I was able to be aware of new houses on the market.   Another aspect I really liked was Danny was able to point out strong/weak points of a house. I feel like having complete honesty in your real estate agent is key. You'll thank them when it's your first night in the house and everything works perfect. Danny and his team were professional in the way they present themselves, the resources they provide, and knowledge of real estate. I really appreciate Danny and the whole Myriad Real Estate Group.   The definition of myriad is "a very large number of things" according to Webster's dictionary. However in my opinion, when purchasing a home there is only ONE option: Myriad Real Estate Group.
