Let's say you're in Phoenix for a conference. You want to unwind at the end of the day with your colleagues, have a leisurely discussion of what you've been conferencing about, and enjoy regional cuisine without wallet-breaking prices or concerns that "authentic" might verge into "scary." GO HERE.  1. It is within walking distance of your hotel, with a lovely view of a garden.  2. The chips are amazing. Think "professional chef reimagines Doritos" for portions of them, but there are also normal tortilla chips and blue corn tortilla chips.  3. The drinks are exceedingly drink-like, with none of that pesky margarita-mix taste. Order something with prickly pear juice in it.  4. In sporadic meals during my years in Arizona, I've never had service that was other than charming. It's possible YMMV if you hit a huge rush, but if they're not jammed, you should feel very happy and pampered.  5. The white-chocolate tamale at the end of the meal is perfect if you want a little something sweet but weren't up for dessert.  Order lots of plates to share among your group because... the food ranges from amazing to meh, and I'd swear sometimes the same dish has been both amazing and meh on different trips. (I'm certain I had the Pablo's enchiladas with a totally exciting salad and very subtle flavors on a past trip, when it was more "well, that's an enchilada, can't argue with that" the most recent time.) The good news is that I've never had a dish be worse than meh, and even the meh-est experience was pretty good for the first two or three bites... so if you have a bunch of dishes and are taking a couple bites of each, the odds are strongly in your favor that you'll generally be very happy.  If that method doesn't work for you, I've had good experience with the carnitas so far. There was also a very pleasant Easter brunch. You're paying about normal street prices, maybe a couple bucks above Macayo's, for enchilada-type meals (and the quality is way better, even on meh days) and $17-$20 for serious entrees.  In any case, you're really here to converse and drink and nibble chips as evening falls across the artificial pond, which experience they do exceedingly well here.  ETA: if you visit on a really cold, sunless day, bundle up! Like many Arizona establishments, this place expects sun through the windows to contribute to a pleasing indoor winter temperature.

A year or two ago, Arizona Center was a destination for shoppers in need of Kokopeli socks or shot glasses blazoned with cacti. No more, no more! The kitschy tourist shops are gone, except for the flag store and the sports logo store. Most of the retail store fronts are simply empty.  Restaurants are still around and range from pizza-by-the-slice through mediocre Mexican to kitschy family dining to high-end sit-down dining. If you're a conventioneer at a downtown hotel and want a walk and some palm-tree-infused atmosphere, you've got lots of dinner choices.  The major reason to come here, at this point, is that you live/work in or near downtown and want either (a) to see a movie or (b) to sit by a fountain and eat. Both of those functions are quite adequate and mean you took light rail or walked. DO NOT use the parking ramp. The few times I've tried it, I've ended up in a line of exiting cars with unreadable tickets. The parking system doesn't work, and it dumps you into some odd bit of "turn this way only" lanes at the edge of downtown.  If it's tourist kitsch you need for pals back home, you're now stuck trekking to Old Town Scottsdale.

If the Chinese economy has a "hard landing," it will look like Cofco Cultural Center.   Most of the storefronts are empty. There's one gift store, woefully declaring "yes, we're open!" There are restaurants on either side of Ranch Market that may be the same restaurant with different names. The architecture is pretty in a "Disney does China" way, but it's essentially a strip mall with a high vacancy rate, anchored by a supermarket.

If you are not up for the authentic-Chinese-with-eel-and-intestines-and-kidneys menu, do not eat here. Just don't.  This is the sort of Chinese restaurant that shows its contempt for Americanized Chinese food by cooking it badly (and very possibly by just dumping pre-fab food from Sysco into the wok, as my fried rice looked remarkably like the fried rice I'd bought in a bag at Winco last year).  My logic in trying an entr√©e that wasn't wildly challenging was that $12.95 is a lot to risk on a complete unknown -- but if I tried something somewhat familiar and liked it, then I'd feel confidence in branching out into more challenging dishes next time, and could thus gradually expand my horizons. (This is after determining that genuine Chinese dishes I'd had elsewhere weren't available, possibly because my faves are not Szechwan. I did try. I rather wanted certain oyster or hot-pot dishes of yore.)  Nope. There are two customers in Szechwan Palace's world: those who know and love authentic Chinese food with ingredients that do not usually appear in American cooking, and those who are so dead to taste and cuisine that they will be happy with food-service diced veg in their fried rice. No middle ground will be offered.

With its remodeling, this Walgreens has undergone a strange and wonderful transformation that is probably best viewed at 11 p.m. on the night before a major holiday. I may have to go back on Christmas Eve to confirm this hypothesis.  The deal here is that drugstores, convenience stores, dollar stores, grocery stores, and discount department stores (Target, Walmart) all want each other's business and are gradually transforming into one another. So this Walgreens is sort of a baby Walmart: smaller! cuter! friendlier! oh-so-adorbs! let's chuck it under its sweet dimpled chin and buy lots of seasonal candy!  While rival CVS has gone the route of wide aisles with cheerful-yet-strangely-useless signage, Walgreens is packing the merchandise in. The experience is much more like the drugstores I remember fondly as a child: narrow aisles, tons o' stuff, and you never know what you'll find. It has gone hogwild for minor convenience electronics -- the stuff like car adapters and chargers where it's a pain to figure out what store even to try. Also: walls of Ferro Rocher!   There may be a real niche here for "what I want is too specialized for QT or Circle K to carry it, but if I have to face Walmart or the grocery store or the mall, I'm gonna cry" shoppers. Keep an eye out for the house brands that are now being featured prominently (nice!, de-lish, savings with a smile), as the pricing on these can be really, really good.   In a sensible move, this Walgreens has recognized that people who are buying cat litter, batteries, lipstick, cold medication, bourbon, and orange juice at 4 a.m. are not people in any shape to figure out how to queue. The cash registers are approached by a cattle run built from candy and small-electronics displays, and as a person who's recently endured the Camelback/16th CVS's Queue of Mass Confusion, I am grateful that there is no ambiguity about where to line up and who's next.  I want to see what happens with the displays when Christmas is no longer dominant before I get too giddy, but this store looks to have become a lot of fun.

In the time since my first review, this Walgreen's has gotten too big for its britches. The staff who used to be nice are long gone, replaced by kids who think it's funny to allow line jumpers and staff who move at the speed of slow and look resentful at doing their jobs.  Prices are up dramatically, while the fresh fruit is gone, many of the fresh foods are gone, the housewares section has lost its verve. You can still get bargains in the beauty section, but otherwise you will be paying through the nose for convenience (plus the privilege of being treated rudely).  Quality has also generally declined. The house brand cat litter, which used to be great, is now as useless as beach sand and exists solely so you remember how the box stank all week and pay double the going rate for Tidy Cat. The $15 rayon dresses -- wonderful for summer around the house -- are now so skimpy that I can barely get my arms through the arm holes (they used to err the other direction).   As the place has declined, the clientele has gotten sketchier, too. You now have less chance of being hassled and hustled at Fortess CVS down on McDowell, which is adjacent to a homeless encampment.  Next time I need cat litter, I'm setting the alarm early and going to Walmart when it's not hotter than the surface of the sun here. When your service makes the Christown Walmart look like Nordstrom, you're doing it wrong.  (The funny thing is, before the Great Recession, stores cared about customer service. Now that same-store sales are in the low single digits, if not actually negative, and chains are struggling to hold stable against the behemoth of Amazon, the prevailing customer service attitude is "Don't like it? Feel free to take your money elsewhere." They know all they have to do is outlast their lone remaining bricks-and-mortar competitor.)

This Jack in the Box is a pleasant reminder of how Jack in the Box used to be, years ago, when fast food was pitched primarily as a wholesome family dinner, rather than as something to quell the "munchies."  The restaurant is always clean and non-rowdy. The staff is always nice and patient. I don't go there terribly often, but my order is always correct, hot, and looks remarkably like the product photo. Hours are more limited than for other JitBs in the region, so check their web site before going -- but they're open when they say they'll be.  If you're from a region that doesn't have JitB, it's your basic burger chain, only it serves breakfast all day, and the menu runs toward the daring side, with occasional forays into WTH? territory. (Protip: You don't want the standard two-taco set. They're not kidding about sticking a slice of American cheese in there.) You will not experience revelations on the scale of Smashburger, and these really aren't "better burgers" so much as "way more out there burgers." So go with it firmly in mind that this is a restaurant that does well *for fast food*, not one that aspires to more.  (Also, don't generalize the recommendation to other JitB locations, as they vary from equally ept but packed with tweaking meth heads to staffed with utter apathy and confusion.)

So in certain science fiction/fantasy novels, there's this shop that exists only some of the time, and it's packed with peculiar goodies, and it might be a gateway to another dimension?  This is that shop. Note the name. That's your tip-off.  If you carry a large purse or tote bag, lock it in your vehicle, as the aisles here are very, very narrow. The vintage clothing selection was huge and looked amazing, but I literally didn't dare turn to look at it for fear of sending a shelf of china flying. Clothing is something for next time.  There is a LOT of glass and china for the space, and it's not the same five dish patterns that you'll find in every antique mall. If you're looking for something specific, I imagine that the best approach is to act as if you're in the sheep's knitting shop in Through the Looking Glass. Follow the shelves with your eyes slooooowwwwwly up to the ceiling, hoping that your item will not ascend hastily through the ceiling to escape you. If that fails, shut your eyes, think hard about what you want, then try again. There's a better than average chance that it will appear.  There's also all sorts of jewelry and tiny bits of things. The delight of this shop is that it's not "curated" or "precious," but it somehow has a point of view, and the owner is truly the nicest person ever. This is a store for when you're in the mood to browse and chat and stumble over remarkable things -- not for when you're on the track of a list of home decor -- as it requires exploration and nothing is priced; and if you take the experience for what it is, it is literally a refreshing step back to a simpler time with better housewares, some of which you can buy and take home.  It doesn't hurt that it's now part of the most adorable vintage strip mall in Phoenix, along with the Purple Lizard (your one-stop Instant Wise Southwestern Woman boutique), Southwest Gardener (all that glitters for your landscaping), and the Original Hamburger Works (what Fuddruckers aspired to be, with authenticity).  On my visit, the back door gave only onto the mall's shared internal patio (a charming place for a winter lunch), but depending on your timing, your luck may be different.

This Michaels is the foundation of my theory that some chains stay in business despite the reality that shoppers loathe them, because there's no adequate substitute. It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.  Every section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that. The staff will explain, with varying levels of chagrin, that "this is the smallest Michaels in the region."  That much is obvious. It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles.   The major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue.   There was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary. A lot. But it's rarely a matter of: "oh great! I'm going to Michaels so I can skip the squats at the gym!"

Last time I got ice cream here, the clerk kept insisting the flavor I wanted would be too spicy for me.  While that was annoying, I figured I'd give them one more chance because I really wanted ice cream before going grocery shopping. The one gal in the store simply wouldn't acknowledge me or wait on me. I'm dressed for work, so while I probably look like it was a long day, I don't look homeless. But hey, I'm not good enough for your $5 ice cream scoops.  This store is now out of chances with me.

Twice now, I have gotten better service here than in three years of dealing with the Apple store down the block at Biltmore.  Let's think this one over. Apple's brand is great design and outstanding customer service. Best Buy's brand is "we still exist! don't you need some cables today?"  About six weeks ago, my Macbook suddenly died in the way that indicates a choice between complete replacement and a couple weeks in the shop. Having needed seven trips to the Apple store last time it required work, I decided to shop for a Windows machine. Best Buy had an acceptable laptop on sale for roughly one-quarter the price of a new Mac. I ordered it for store pick-up, got an email it was ready as soon as the store opened, zipped in and picked it up with no hard sell of warranties, no effort to push add-ons, no patronizing interference with my setting it up.  Six weeks later, its operating system went kablooey. I took it back to Best Buy, and in a matter of minutes, the customer service gal had determined that the laptop was defective and they needed to give me a new one. It seems, from the side-chat with her supervisor, that she had to do some exceptions to not put me into a loop of futile diagnostics and repairs -- AND SHE DID THAT EXCEPTION VOLUNTARILY. I know from experience that Apple will put customers in the Loop of Futility. The whole return-and-replace got done as fast as their transaction system would accept typing, and I got a small refund because the price of that laptop had gone down in the meantime.  These are the two least annoying transactions I've had in 20 years of buying computers.  I wish they would start selling toys, the way Fry's Electronics does, as I don't often need computer equipment, but I'd happily come buy toys from these people.

wow  such Italian  very diner  I wandered into Giuseppe's on a Friday evening when, after a highly productive day, I was in the grip of the sort of letdown where one feels acutely aware of one's own mortality and the fragility of the word, a mood that requires a polysyllabic German word, so I'm going to give it one: Weltgrunegotterdammerung.  My original plan was to try out the Angry Crab, but the shrieks of the happy hour revelers could be heard halfway down the arcade of the shopping plaza, and being surrounded by "young professionals" getting wasted on bloody marys is not a cure for Weltgrunegotterdammerung.  Giuseppe's is a price notch upward (blackboard basic entrees are ~$11 and menu fancy entrees are in mostly in the mid/high teens) but comes with peace, quiet, and a sense of participating in that uniquely American institution: the fine-ish dining hole-in-the-wall in a strip mall. Plus you can combine watching the sun set behind the palm trees with pretending you're in Rome in the 1950s, and any moment now, Audrey Hepburn is going to pull up on a Vespa.  The point of the bread is to mop up the excess pasta sauce, as it's happy sponge-y bread rather than bread that one eats on its own and then spends three years trying to reproduce at home with dutch ovens and spritzers. I consumed an insane amount of it while sponging up the butter/oil-type sauce from the shrimp ravioli because it was the sort of sauce that one is required to sponge, if not to actually lick the plate. If a little splashes or spills in the sponging process, it probably does excellent things for soft, younger-looking skin, too.  The shrimp ravioli contained an identifiable shrimp! I've never before encountered anything that wasn't a mash in a seafood rav anywhere, nor a sauce that contained spices rather than being all alfredo-esque. The rav were very nice, with some crab and some ricotta -- just rich enough to feel reasonably content with the quantity, but not taking it to the point where one wonders what one just did. I'm actually relieved not to have fallen madly in love with them -- sorry, shrimp rav, it was just a fling, as there are many other tempting items on the menu. Boar ragu!  True love -- or at least strong animal passion -- is elicited by the white-chocolate creme brulee. Dante would have written several volumes in verse to the white-chocolate creme brulee.  I'm reviewing it partly so it can be added to the "kind to lone diners" list, as the staff were absolute sweethearts. They were clearly trying to hit the right pace where I could enjoy a leisurely meal without feeling neglected (or, conversely, be promptly attended to without feeling rushed) -- and since I myself didn't really know what mood I was in (Weltgrunegotterdammerung will do that for a girl), that was a bit of a challenge. I strongly suspect that this is the sort of place where, if you go regularly, they remember you and see that things are as you like them.

It's one of that consignment stores that refuses clothes one originally bought from them because the labels aren't designer enough.   I would never shop here again, since if I pay $40 for a skirt, wear it twice, and decide it doesn't work for me, they'll snootily refuse it as inferior to what they stock, obviously, in tones of "how dare I sully their store with this trash?" They even accused me of lying about ever having an account with them, when I'd said I wasn't sure and it was from years ago.   In fairness, I would swear the place has changed management or employees. It used to be possible to buy high-end office clothes here and the staff were nice. Now it's a trophy-wife clothes, staffed by the rudest, snootiest women I've ever encountered in a clothing store. I should probably be grateful I now don't have store credit I'd have to use there.

Service here is always friendly, and it's a pleasant place that offers a lot of fish for the buck. Go for fish over lobster or shrimp, as you get more food for the buck, and it tastes good going down. Plus, salsa bar! They've added dessert, and the coconut-lime bars are really good. Not so good is the sangria, which has a strange cardboard background taste.  Why two stars? Well, it doesn't taste so good coming back up. Five hours later, it all did, and the problem lasted for 24 hours. That matches food poisoning with that meal as the source. It's too bad, as I enjoyed the meal while it was happening, but this is a risk I wouldn't take again.

I think I'm in love. Truth is, I'm promiscuous with coffeehouses and tend to love the one I'm with. But Grinder's is an adorably soothing place for a Sunday morning coffee, being completely without hip conceptual DJs, big screen TVs, or deal-making hipsters. Sip your brew, watch the progress of the sun over the mountain, read an actual print newspaper.  The sweet roll is properly flaky, not squishy, and has either cream cheese or sour cream frosting. This is the best flaky pastry I've had in Phoenix.  Of course, you're now in Sunnyslope, with nothing to do but a small shopping center. Walk to the transit center and find a bus up to the antique shops on Cave Creek.

Anchovies!  I adore anchovy on pizza, and it's relatively hard to get here. SoNY has anchovies. They also have kalamata olives, which is surprisingly upscale for strip mall pizza.  This is where I went after being treated as Ms. Invisible at Red Thai. Here, I got impeccable, good-natured service, plus a thin-crust pizza that was better than my last trip to Fired Pie. (It doesn't hurt that I prefer crispy crust, but the cheese is also a better texture.)  The house wine is surprisingly drinkable (well, come on, no great wine would have had a chance against anchovies). Now I know where to go to satisfy anchovy cravings.

The Singapore rice noodles are so splendid that I would willingly repeat the two-hours-plus round-trip on the bus required to dine here.  The chile in the noodles is properly deployed to kick you into the early parts if next week without destroying your taste buds. The shrimps are just-cooked, not mealy. The fried egg is soft and has absorbed the sauce. If I made fried egg that good at home, I would be a fried egg maestro. The pork is the proper red kind. Ordinarily, I would try to get two meals out of this, but it clearly called for living in the moment. (And at under $10, it's plenty economical as one meal.)  The decor is straight out of 1987, which is usually a warning sign for Phoenix non-natives, but 1987 was apparently a fantastic year for Chinese food. Service does what it's supposed to do; the plum wine pour is generous; and the packages fortune cookie is neither stale nor inane. Just getting a fresh fortune cookie is splendid.

The official Going Out of Business Sale has started, so negative feelings about this Kmart were presumably universal.  By Kmart standards, it's large and clean. Which did it no good for survival because... Kmart. It's where you go when you want lower quality than Target at a higher price, which is never.  The clerk who checked me out was downright pleasant and helpful, which is worth the extra star. The security guard checking receipts at the door was charming, though I have to ask... you're GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. Does loss prevention still really matter?   I'm coming up dry on finding a planned closing date for this store -- heck, I can't even find it on a list of closures, so maybe staff just spontaneously decided to cut bait -- but I'd expect it to be gone by mid-January 2015. It is specifically NOT participating in the Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday sales, nor in any future offers in the circulars in the newspaper.

This is probably the least miserable of the region's Joanns, in that the clerks will smile both as they overcharge you and as they subsequently reverse the overcharge when you come back and complain.  The clerk at the cutting table was downright helpful and very nice, which is so unusual in Joann-world that I'm hoping this is a pilot store for the concept of Pleasant Customer Service. A charming and fruitful interaction really does ease the tension of how slow and understaffed the cutting table consistently is (well, for me, possibly not for the people behind me in line, but maybe they had a good time when they got to the front, too).  Being Joann, there is a lot of stuff (good!), so much of it is officially on sale that using a coupon that applies only to full-price items is challenging (sort of good, sort of frustrating, I dunno), and there are always long, slow-moving lines (meh!). Since you're not getting out of here quickly no matter what, you may as well allow time to browse, especially the seasonal section. Also -- if you're trying to hit just ONE craft store and you definitely need fabric but also non-fabric stuff, this is the one to hit because it has the best fabric selection and a pretty decent and diverse selection of everything else. If you're up for a craft slog of extreme thoroughness, there is a Michael's in the next plaza west and a Hobby Lobby in the plaza across the street, so with the right combination of coupons, you can fully stock your stash and not have to leave the house all summer.  Check your receipt, though. Srsly.

Any amigo of Ricardo's is an amigo of mine.  I stopped here for a late lunch because the place looked local and authentic, unlike the bright-and-shiny Macayo's down the street. The hot-tortilla scent wafting through the door was so enticing that I was not off-put by the "Cash Only -- Sorry" sign but did another loop around town to find a bank and get cash.  Ricardo and his amigos had me at "free chips and salsa." It is rare in Phoenix to get fresh, hot chips. The salsa is salsa: it's the taco sauce-esque kind. The chips are so delightfully hot and crisp and salty that this scarcely matters.  Beef fajitas were excellent: the beef was juicy, the onions were caramelized, the guacamole was splendid with avocados, the tortillas tasted fresh. Heck, the beans tasted fresh. And I ate the rice. I ordinarily abhor the rice.   All this, with friendly and cheerful service, was only $9.95, when it would have been $14.95 in Phoenix and probably delivered blandly and sullenly as well. This is "comfort Mexican" food -- and by that standard, it's better than the vast majority of what I've tried in Arizona.

Came in dressed for work, though admittedly with my wheeled cart because I was on my way to Walmart. This was apparently sufficient to get me the "delay until the customer leaves" treatment.  You're a crappy burger joint near a Walmart. You have no justification for this level of snobbery.

We tried this for office lunch as a change from Chipotle, since the menu has some interesting options that Chipotle lacks (like fish!) and the dieter (not me) was impressed with the low calorie counts.  Next time, I'm going to suggest we all bond by getting root canals together.  Credit the low calorie counts to tiny portions, so figure your meal will cost the same as at Chipotle, but you'll get maybe 2/3 as much food.  The one counter clerk correctly noted that, since I was clutching a list of items, I was a captive customer. She did the obvious thing for corporate efficiency and kept me waiting (and waiting and waiting), then was snippy while taking the order (after having been sweet to the family ahead of me). She was even snippier to the person after me, so I guess it's not difficult to be inadequate to the glories that are the Blue Burrito.  The carnitas in the street tacos were dry and flavorless, so it's a good thing the portions were so small, as it would have been unkind to ask me to chew through more of that. Refried pinto beans tasted as if a box of black pepper had been spilled in the pot, but the rice was quite good. I can also summon mild enthusiasm for the chips, though the "hot" salsa also tasted more of black pepper than of jalapeno.  So if you're looking to pay $7-$10 a meal for small portions of mediocre (but varied!) food dished up at low speed in a mildly hostile but industrial-chic environment, this Blue Burrito will be your go-to lunch spot in Scottsdale.

Needed specialized screws. Could not get any clerk in screw area to pay attention to me. When I told checkout clerk about this, she cheerily chirped "okay!", so I guess rejecting me as a customer was on purpose.

So the sign on the door says it opens at 5 a.m. At 5;05, the door is locked and the one visible employee looks at me, waiting outside, and scurries in back. Bear in mind that I'm dressed for my white-collar job, so I don't look like I'm going to rob the place or like I've been up all night to get lucky.  I call and ask whether the sign is wrong. Gal doesn't know: they'll open in 10 or 15 minutes, maybe. No guarantees. She refuses to give a reason why they can't open on time or why the sign would be wrong.  So the serious plan was to leave a customer standing outside the restaurant for half an hour past the posted opening. Because when you want fast food, an extra 30 minutes is nothing.

If you have just moved to Phoenix in a torrid July, here's where you pick up your Instant Authenticity Pack without the trouble and expense of the trek to Scottsdale.  Loose, flowing cotton clothing that will BREATHE? Check! Floppy hats? Check! Scented essential oils? Check! Frida Kahlo refrigerator magnets? Check! Small sheet metal lizards? Check! Day of the Dead mariachi bands? Check!  Once these needs are taken care of, you can think about larger issues, like how to restore your adorable CenPho cottage and how large a burger you want at the bar in the same complex. With cool, absorbent organic cotton lying lightly on your skin, you will feel much, much better and more able to cope.  This is not precisely my scene, but if it were, this would be my first stop, as the selection is varied and not unduly sequined, and the environment is delightful.

Half the store is shabby chic, about which I can tell you nothing, so oblivious am I on the way to the paper crafts section.  The paper crafts section is curated to focus on patterns with a vintage feel that's compatible with "shabby chic" but not limited to the strict "faded roses and peeling white paint" interpretation of the concept. So there are plenty of brocades, a certain amount of faded ecru patterns, lots of florals, and an interesting stock of seasonal papers. If you are thinking about decoupage projects to go with a shabby chic decor or a "Parisian apartment" ambience, you will emerge well-stocked. There are also lots of rubber stamps and embellishments.

Christown went through a phase of cute and appealing revival a couple years back. It was fully tenanted, and it was a fun, if quirky, working-class discount mall with diverse customers and the convenience of having both a Walmart and a Target AND being on the light rail line.  It has now become a cesspit.  Vacancies are up, and stores are being replaced by more obscure stores. It's now considered okay for the teenage shop clerks to heckle passing grown-up shoppers, and mall security thinks this is funny. Adding to the ambiance of decay, the air conditioning wasn't keeping up with the traffic, so it was at least 85 degrees in the mall interior.  If you're west of Central and want a mall, Metro Center is cleaner, neater, and politer, while Desert Sky has a far better selection of Hispanic-themed stores (and is also cleaner, neater, and politer). Either also has a parking lot with a less kill-or-be-killed layout.

A "brass armadillo" is presumably a gift given to blushing Victorian brides... oh, never mind.  This is my favorite of the Phoenix-area "antique malls" for a number of reasons:  1. It's relatively central -- no long haul to Glendale or Mesa, no sense that one ought to spend the day.  2. The hours are incredibly long -- not just by antique-store standards, but by normal retail standards. This is an antique mall that lends itself to impulse visits.  3. It's not super-chi-chi antique-y. Basically, it's a fantasy department store of old stuff, mostly "nice" old stuff but not super-high-end rarities, mostly furniture and housewares and toys, running heavily but not exclusively to the sweet and frilly. If you're an MCM afficionado, this store should not be your first-choice hang-out, but you'll find something occasionally, most likely amidst the dishes. Booths are attractively arranged, and the operation is cheerful and professional, so don't look for OMG!bargain finds by digging through dusty bins. It's more a case of reasonable-ish pricing with the fun of browsing in a pleasant environment. A normal sort of middle-class person without cash to burn can still find plenty of affordable vintage goodies.  4. There is a scrapbook booth. It's small and heavily curated to be "antique-ish" in feel.  5.  The snack bar can make a very pleasant grilled-cheese sandwich and an enjoyable latte. In a place this big, a snack in hand is very welcome.

The $8.99 salad bar-with-appetizers lunch is a huge win if your real goal is to eat a solid, pretty cheap lunch and you want some vegetables to make you feel good about what you're planning to do with taco shells, potato skins, and, later, dessert. The staff will help you feel good, as they are the sweetest people ever, and they deliver generous drink refills along with baskets of cheese toast.  If you're looking for fancy pre-made salads, the selection is smaller and less creative than at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes. If, like me, you're going with a few spinach or lettuce frills as a base for the good stuff, Sizzler has the edge of offering not just diced ham, not just pepperoni slices, but also diced bacon. There is also ambrosia salad, demonstrating a proper respect for the role of marshmallows in traditional salad-making (for real -- cookbooks of the 1950s love marshmallows and whipped cream in "salad").  The only soup (of the four) that I tried was the clam chowder: since it is the "signature" soup, it is available on a day other than Friday (say, Saturday!), which may make the case for this buffet right there. It's not going to send you into rhapsodies about the chowder you once ate in Boston or San Francisco, but it is recognizable and pleasant clam chowder that goes nicely with the cheese toast. Again, soup selection was less diverse than Sweet Tomatoes... but the trade-off for not getting Greek lemon soup or other more chi-chi delights is being able to have clam chowder on a non-Friday.  The appetizer bar, while small, blows past Sweet Tomatoes on the grounds of offering actual proteins (Sweet Tomatoes' spread looks splendidly chi-chi and healthful, then it dawns on you that it's a carb wallow) and past Souper Salad on grounds of offering... carnitas! Carnitas! I just met a scoop of carnitas! There are also flour tortillas deep-fried into cup shapes, and there is fresh guacamole that is definitely made with actual avocados. It is possible to construct a highly respectable Tex-Mex lunch.  There are also various forms of chicken parts (which I didn't try), potato skins (ditto), and pasta that can be draped with meatballs (which were pleasant, though not memorable). If you worked at it, you could probably manage a pasta in a salsa cream sauce, like at the chi-chi fusion restaurants... and on my next visit, I might.  The best part of Souper Salad, on a good day, is getting the gingerbread and slathering it with sundae toppings. Sizzler goes more for poundcake -- it also has mini desserts and soft serve -- and promises the exotic addition of pineapple topping. I need to go here on a day when I'm utterly starving, as there is much to explore, now that I have the lay of the land.  This is a four-star rating on the basis of being good at being a budget-ish buffet lunch, so if you're looking for organic greens and the finest ingredients, Sizzler's not a hidden Maryvale treasure. It's better-than-fast-food at a fast food price, plus everything's labeled with any common food allergy triggers (so you may not be able to eat everything, but at least you won't break out in horrible symptoms), and my delightful server brought me a to-go cup for the remainder of my iced tea (gratefully accepted, since I was taking the bus).

One very hot summer day, the only customers here were me and one other woman who was equally intent on the basket of miniature serapes. I was looking for possible dollhouse rugs and blankets (and got a very nice gray serape with pale blue trim). She may have been after party favors.  This store is my go-to spot for random dollhouse decor, as there is a ton of small stuff -- ironwood animals, talavera animals, soapstone animals, painted clay pots, Day of the Dead figures -- all at inexpensive prices. It's one of two stores I always visit in Old Town (the other is the western store kitty-corner with the free samples of salsa) and the only one where I always buy something.

This is the nicest, most courteous, most efficient Taco Bell I have ever encountered. The food even tastes better, as if the fryer is adjusted a little more precisely and the line made a tad more effort to put things together just right.  If I give it five stars, unwary readers will expect that the menu has somehow changed to be authentic, and of course, Taco Bell food does not aspire to authenticity in any way. Taco Bell aspires to ranch dip with taquitos, The difference is that when it's done badly, it's depressing; and when it's done well, it has a certain cheerful vulgarity that's easy on the wallet.

This is good cheap pizza for those moments when you don't care whether the mozzarella came from buffaloes who had their hooves massaged daily -- you simply want lunch to be cheap, pleasant, filling, and served politely.  The decor that emphasizes vintage Volkswagen buses, presumably to remind the Glendale retirees of eating pizza like this when they were students at UC Berkeley, between protests. This is a very good pizza to fill you up, ridiculously cheap, when you're exhausted from a hot day of protesting.  It tastes like good, ordinary pizzeria pizza slices used to taste, back before pizza was a gourmet thing. The crust is thin, mildly salty, and pleasant enough that I ate all of it, though not in the vein of uttermost crust rhapsodies, more with the "don't mind me, nothin' here to see" feel of eating the broken cookie bits from the Chips Ahoy package. Don't order the ham on your slice, as it's unexciting ham: get pepperoni or sausage. Toppings are 26 cents each on slices, and the slices are large, so it's quite economical to get exactly what you want, though with slices of this consistency, I would stop at a maximum of four toppings. A fork's likely to be wanted, unless you believe in doing pizza-slice origami.  I've gone back and forth between three and four stars because it's fairly ordinary pizza, but it's ordinary in a good way, and if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably eat here a lot. My eating the crust justifies the higher rating, as does their delightfully old school method of having customers make iced-tea by pouring tea from a hot-pot with teabags over ice.

"Valley institution" is a code phrase. It means the restaurant dates from an era when Phoenix and environs were small towns in the middle of nowhere, back in the day when the middle if nowhere didn't have the same chains as everywhere else. If you moved here from a larger, more established metro area, a Valley institutions are distinctly eat-at-your-own-risk.  I like this one because it's one of the few places on Mill Avenue that isn't some sort of "scene." There are times when I do not feel hipsterish or sophisticated or possessed of sufficient humor to eat fried food served by scantily clad young women (which describes a lot of bistros here, not just Hooters). I want food put in front of me in decent quiet by servers who stay off my lawn. This restaurant does that.  Chips were admittedly undistinguished and served with traditional Phoenix-style salsa (translation: mild and stewed). My chorizo con huevos, however, were hot and delicious. The tortillas are super tortillas engineered at a top-secret location and well worth the security clearance. The refried beans are also truly fine. My margarita existed. There are plenty of bars Mill. Go to one of those if you want your margarita to be other than an aid to digestion.   Service is friendly, unobtrusive, and fully clad. My shattered nerves are repaired. I left feeling like I'd wandered into a nice abuelita's kitchen and emerged properly nourished.

Now I understand why so many reviews trash this place. I don't think I've ever gone on a Sunday before, but what I got was: --Stale chips --Lukewarm food --Bare minimum of service  The waitress had clearly decided I wasn't going to tip, as I couldn't even get a drink refill or a "how is everything?" check. Now, I usually tip 20%, but when waitstaff is doing everything possible to treat me like a non-tipper, at some point, I shrug and oblige.  When I told her the food was lousy, she offered to void the bill, which is the only thing she did right; but I did eat it, so I paid because it's not fair to stiff a restaurant, even one that I'd never return to.  Basically, if you haven't been a regular since the 1960s (literally -- I was the only customer born after 1960), you can find better Mexican in Tempe, and you should.

This store is long gone and its part of the building has been torn down. If you go here, you will find a construction zone, and then in the future, you will find whatever's being built. But I doubt it will be the smelly dive that was Unique Thrift.

The post-2011 Qcumberz is Apartment Therapy-bait.  It works like this. You move to Phoenix. You get yourself a little mid-century modern house with a flat roof and a carport. You binge-read AT's "before and after" posts until you are gripped by the certainty that your happiness depends on buying an appalling used piece of furniture from the 1970s and rehabbing it with paint (probably aqua... you liked the gray-and-white chevron movement, but now that's feeling soooo 2013)... but everything at the two nearest Goodwills is from the 1980s and 1990s,and there are no Chicness Points in repainting that stuff.   Then you go to Cucumberz, which is chock-a-block with chunky Mediterranean cabinets and chairs from the late 1960s, already painted aqua for you, plus a few that haven't been repainted yet, OMG, so those must be the bargains! If the wood on the drawers is in good shape, you could wax the drawers and paint the frame white! So clever! I bet that 1972 dresser from Sears could pass as MCM if you did that!  Really, seriously, if you want to live the AT lifestyle at the DIY end (as opposed to the high-end actual-Heywood-Wakefield end found at Red Modern or the tongue-in-cheek-ironic end from Retro Ranch), Qcumberz is like an entire mall devoted to your needs, down to the plastic swirly wall-thingies -- they'll look scupltural in gloss white! -- that Urban Outfitters probably will be selling by June. There are vintage record albums! There are starter pieces for your vintage Pyrex collection (though apparently 90% of the vintage Pyrex on earth has retired to Phoenix,so you'll be able to pick and choose). There is a little outdoor salvage alley to take care of your porch furniture needs.  The owners are cheerful and friendly, and while I liked the place better when it was an over-crowded junk shop, it's still the least pretentious store on Seventh Avenue and the most fun to dig through.

Since my usual habit is to see movies after work, during the last moments of matinee pricing, the advent of theaters-that-serve-real-dinner is extremely welcome.  After years of paying $7 for a small popcorn, I expected real-food prices to be airport-exorbitant... but the dinner menu pricing is roughly comparable to what the same food would cost at a regular restaurant in the neighborhood, possibly even a bit less, since the BIltmore area is muy expensivo.   Seating in the Cinema Suites puts your meal on a generous arm rest, rather than on a table in front of you (as at Studio Movie Grill). I like this set-up a little better for keeping things out of my way when I'm done eating; depending on your need to cut food, you may disagree. Seats are sharply terraced, so one's view is not blocked by servers working the rows in front.  The menu is less "basic pub food" and more "chi-chi Biltmore grill" than at Studio Movie Grill, though it still sensibly emphasizes food that can be eaten in the dark without undue complications. I've had some sort of panini that was apparently enjoyable but not memorable (with sweet-potato fries, as I think serving sweet-potato fries is required by law in that neighborhood) and then, on another occasion, a lobster pizza that was fabulous. If you can find something to order that strikes you as faintly silly and you wouldn't order it elsewhere, but the price is okay here, that's probably the way to go.  Make sure to validate your parking at the front desk, as the complicated and annoying parking garage otherwise charges rather a lot. Fortunately, I have not yet learned this the hard way.

One chicken chimichanga later, I'm baffled by the rave reviews.  At lunch time on a Sunday, the place was quiet, possibly because it's not really on the main drag in historic downtown Wickenburg, possibly because few people other than me think going to Wickenburg in August is a great idea.  One gal, who appeared to be in charge, was a sweetheart and very on the ball. Unfortunately, the other staff were... not naturals at working in a service industry.  Great food might have saved this situation, or at least rendered it humorous. Unfortunately, the chicken chimichanga was filled with bland, unseasoned chicken: I guess the regulars know to order it enchilada-style to get flavor from the salsa. The beans and rice were beans and rice. I can't deny that the true, natural flavor of the chicken was front and center. So if you want to savor that chicken in its full chickenosity, this is the dish for you. In its defense, it was genuinely a nice chicken, with no icky bits left in.  Best part of the meal was the "hot" salsa, which is actually hot -- not a given in Arizona. It comes in a set of three dips: hot, normal, and refried bean. This is adorable and fun, and I wish more restaurants did it.  If I were compelled to eat here again, I'd order something that is definitely, positively slow-cooked in its sauce. If I were bringing an aging relative who didn't like "hot" food, I'd order the chicken chimichanga.

If you're really into Del Taco and this is your best location to find it, look upon it and despair!  The $1 strawberry lemonade is excellent -- it contains actual frozen strawberries in their defrosted form -- and I don't regret trying the bacon mini-quesadilla because bacon. I appreciate that Del Taco has salsa verde.  I don't appreciate waiting 10 minutes for a $2 order, only to discover it had been never been started. The dude in charge hated his life and wasn't trying to hide it. The dude on the line appeared terrified into utter confusion. I understand that the smiles at McDonald's are merely masks for tormented  and oppressed souls, but I appreciate the effort to fake it, y'know?  The combination of $1 menu, strawberry lemonade, and prime location means I probably will eat here again, but I'm not proud of this.

This Walmart correctly and promptly handled my Ship-To-Store order. I didn't know that EVER happened.  It also carries family-sized packs of chocolate Gansitos. You will never want Twinkies or Zingers again, once you've had Gansitos.  The fast food eatery is a very expensive Subway, so you can have some illusion of healthfulness if you're starving mid-trip, but this is a good neighborhood for cheap food, so I'd eat at the plaza across 51st Avenue.  Otherwise, it's a Walmart. It's better on Mexican food than a lot of them, and it's the only place I've ever seen canned boiled peanuts. It does not achieve the breakdown-of-society chaos of the Walmarts at Christown or at Thomas and 36th Street, and if you're hauling stuff to the bus, the parking lot is pleasingly shallow. It does not, however, aspire to the majesty of the Walmart at the far north end of Scottsdale.

For years, I have tolerated that this Whataburger is slower than sit-down dining, gets my order wrong, and overcharges me, mostly because the chain sometimes introduces menu items I like.  Today, I went in search of a jalape√±o breakfast biscuit, which is a truly fine idea. At 6:45, the place was empty except for two clerks sitting in the dining area. They stared and giggled at my bemusement that there was nobody to take my order, as apparently the manager thinks it makes sense to send everybody who can operate a cash register on break simultaneously.  Only when I started to walk out did one of the staff yell for attention in the kitchen. After much yelling, somebody in back said she'd be out in a while. Since there were no other customers in the restaurant or the drive-thru, I'm not sure what was more urgent than serving an actual customer, but I've known management to set some odd metrics that get in the way of customer service.  "I give up -- you don't want customers," I said, and I went to get a biscuit at the QT across the street.  Larger fast food chains have a metric of time-for-service, and they're always trying to reduce it. Not Whataburger! Whataburger cultivates the pure Customer Contempt Approach.

These are the hash browns that elicit paragraphs of purple prose on the art of the perfect hash brown: crispy outside, creamy inside.  The bacon is pretty damn good, too,  It's important to remember that Mel's is not a loving, Disneyfied, hipster recreation of a vintage dive diner. It is an actual dive diner, divey continuously for however many decades, originated in the era when Phoenix was the spot on the highway where your radiator blew.   As a genuine dive. It's quite magnificent. Service is quick and unpretentious, food is good, prices are low, and you can have gravy on your biscuits and salsa on your eggs.

The service was very sweet and well-meaning, so as an experience where I sit still in an air-conditioned space and people bring me stuff, this was fine.  The stuff... not so fine. Let's get the party started with... stale chips. I am also skeptical that the sangria contained any alcohol at all. While I'm grateful to have not had a buzz on with a drive home, if I'd wanted alcohol-free fruit juice, I would have stopped at Fry's for a quart of cran-grape and paid less than the $6.50 that went with a small glass of mostly ice.  The steak fajitas consisted of a great mass of caramelized onion and seven small strips of the most gristly steak I've ever encountered. The fajita strips I buy at the supermarket are openly "meat leftovers we can't sell otherwise," and they have less gristle. I seriously worried about pulling a tooth loose while trying to bite through these and had to give up on wrapping the fajita fillings in tortillas, which is kind of the gist of the fajita experience.  Or not, since only two tortillas are provided. Do not look to the guacamole for flavor; it could well be the shortening-and-green-coloring kind sold at the supermarket.  Oh, and the free wi-fi wasn't connected to the internet. Um, what's the point of wi-fi,then?  I went into Manuel's thinking "I'll be adventurous, I'll support local business, I remember having really good food for cheapish at a Manuel's right after I moved to Phoenix." I left feeling that the proprietors were laughing at people like me for paying $15 an entree for food that doesn't measure up to most people's home leftovers.  That's the last time I impulsively stop at a restaurant before checking Yelp, as any number of people could have warned me.

The trick is to go early enough on a winter morning that the restaurant is in twilight -- either it has no artificial lights in the atrium or they don't turn them on for breakfast -- so you can watch the city slowly wake up. Phoenix is remarkably reluctant to face the day -- it's not so much the "city that never sleeps" as the city that rolls out of bed at 8:55 and fumbles for the aspirin -- but turns very pleasing shades of pinky-gray while doing so.  It's a good burrito. One special merit, if you're not absolutely committed to the cheapest deal, is that it's possible to get a burrito with no eggs. The scrambled eggs I've had here are perfectly fine, but some days I'm not up for trusting other people to make eggs and on those days, a huge burrito packed with chorizo and potatoes hits the spot.  I've yet to have any problem with service. The ladies behind the counter are firm, but honestly, dealing with me before breakfast requires communicating like a strict kindergarten teacher.

Trying the ribs here was supposed to be our office bonding experience. And it was!  First, we bonded over skepticism about the food we got as takeaway. The ribs were fatty, the pulled chicken was flavorless, the beef was... odd. The only win was the cornbread, which wasn't too sweet and had peppers in it. The peach cobbler was proclaimed "gross" by my colleagues with such vehemence that I didn't even try it.   Second, we bonded over a lively discussion of our symptoms in the subsequent days, as we (and none of our families or friends) enjoyed nausea, chills, severe stomach cramping, joint aches, and intestines that did not work as they usually ought. It was intense. Nothing forges that immediate sense of intimacy with a coworker like a good barfing story.  So while a large takeaway order from Ribshack probably did more for corporate bonding than a pricey workshop out in the woods with rope bridges and such, our unanimous decision is never to eat there again.

ABOUT TO CLOSE.  This store is in the midst of a going-out-of-business sale. As of today, more than half the store is cleared of merchandise, and what's left is marked down 33% to 50%, depending on the department. Clerks were discussing 75% markdowns starting "next week" but were not sure when "next week" started.  This was always kind of a meh store compared to Desert Ridge, and I suspect the shiny new Hobby Lobby in the same plaza killed it. Too bad -- I liked having Hobby Lobby, Michaels, and Joann all in one spot.

Two words: lobster ice cream.  It's seasonal, and having tried it, I'm not sure it was actually a good idea... but a city needs a place where it's possible to order a lobster ice cream sundae with caramel sauce. For those wondering, the ice cream tastes cream-flavored and contains chunks of frozen lobster.  Every other flavor I've tried here has been comparatively normal and quite delicious. The sundaes are made with generous amounts of sauce. There are sofas, as well as tables, and there are local magazines and free wifi. There is also an adjoining pizza shop, should calories be no object (and a hospital across the street, should a heart attack ensue).

What happened to this Michael's? It's huge and used to have a great selection, as well as reasonably fast checkout.  The store is now so badly organized that the same sale storage boxes have aisles in at least three sections, but adhesives seem to have vanished other than a tiny display of spray and stick glue (by scrapbook paper) plus some tape over by wrapping paper. There is no Mod Podge. What kind of craft store does not carry Mod Podge?  Yarn crafts have been decimated to make room for desperate efforts to imitate Hobby Lobby's selection of housewares. Denim apparently has to happen for spring.  The store is almost empty of shoppers and there are no clerks on the floor to ask questions of. I get that it's good to freshen and rearrange the stock to encourage random browsing, but when I've been down every aisle twice and still don't have the really basic staple I came here for, ur doin it rong.  Y'all have more competition since Hobby Lobby arrived a few years ago. Try harder.

To find this adorable coffee hut, turn down the brick-paved alley that's next to Old Roma Pizza. You'll see some tables and chairs, and then to your left, there's a big glass window and an iron gate. Go through the gate, and you'll find the door to entire Shot of Java.  I had an incredibly fancy sticky-sweet coffee drink before braving the Arizona ICON convention, and it was every bit as fancy, sticky-sweet, and multi-flavored as I'd hoped. I don't remember what it actually was -- possibly peanut-butter mocha?  The interior is kind of hipster rustic, but if the weather is nice, I strongly recommend hanging out on the benches in the alley, where you can people-watch on Glendale Avenue. I think I also got myself an almond bar, which is like a small slab of pecan pie, only almond-flavored. It was extremely pleasing when I ate it later, to recover from Arizona ICON.

7:30 on Sunday morning is the time when the Daily Dose shifts from being a serviceable and pleasant upscale eatery to being a magical experience. The staff has had a few minutes to get into the groove; the tourists aren't up yet; the sun pours through the east-facing windows. It has the feel of a pub-like local hangout in a charming urban neighborhood.  This is a restaurant where it's a good idea to settle on a couple of dishes that you can't get elsewhere. The overall cooking is in line with the ambience and price range, and there are a lot of $12-$20/person bruncheries in this region. The major reason to show up is to wallow in what they do particularly well.  My personal vote starts with dishes that involve scrambled eggs. I don't like eggs all that much, but oh goodness, Daily Dose eggs... light and fluffy and NOT greasy and NOT chewy and really quite delectable to gently inhale. The originating chickens would preen with pride at these scrambled eggs. The rosemary steak is a breakfast steak, and it manages to actually be "medium" (not always a no-brainer with the thin steaks), and isn't loaded with fat, so I'm quite, quite content with having started there.  Avoid the biscuit. It is leaden and, peculiarly, grilled. I felt that the berry-laden blueberry jam was wasted on the biscuit.  Next time, I'd try the breakfast nachos on the strength of the scrambled eggs.

Dive Mexican that's delicious when sober. Plus you get authenticity points for going to a place not ending in -berto's.  The chicken is cooked in the sauce. I cannot over-emphasize this point. It is thus properly flavored chicken because it is cooked in the sauce.  Also super-cheap: $7 with drink.

Mochi mochi mochi! A mochi source near my neighborhood, not all the way out at Cofco or, worse yet, in Chandler.  This is a hole-in-the-wall market, bigger than a bodega but not at all on a supermercado scale. It has a lot of noodles. Honestly, it has more noodles than seems logically possible.  There is an aisle of Indian sauces, which is excellent, because no matter how much I like the Indian market in Tempe, it's a haul. There is an aisle of Mexican beans and other Goya products, which I thought a little pricey but I didn't take a full look for anything exotic. There are shrimp crackers. There are completely inexplicable boxed pastries, as well as packaged moon pies (the Chinese kind, not the North Carolina kind). There is an aisle of rice cookers and little blue bowls.  This is not your spot for frozen wonders -- I think the cold section might be only refrigerated, and I'm not sure I even understood much of what it was. In general, you'll want to be able to sort of cook, at least on the level of rehydrating your noodles, reheating your Beef Balls (actual product), and heating them in a helpful jar of sauce.  The lighting runs dim, but I wouldn't have said it's dirty or smelly; I've been to far, far grungier places in small towns back East. The staff don't necessarily speak English (or, at least, not to you), so you'll want to be confident in the thing you're doing (or so devil-may-care that you will regard it as a pleasant surprise if a mystery can turns out to be tripe in bitter melon sauce, which I can't guarantee is an actual product, but I can't guarantee it isn't, either). Also: the truly daring can get pastries filled with durian creme.  I'm going with four stars because the place is jammed with useful ingredients, and it is a frequent source of frustration to me that regular supermarkets have "Asian" sections consisting of three cans of Chun King products and a couple of Thai boxed dinners, with no Indian food at all. So I'm looking mostly for "exotic" ingredients and emergency mochi; if the butcher counter inspires terror, I've probably already bought meat elsewhere in a form that doesn't dispute my belief that hamburger grows on trees in little plastic-wrapped packages.

Beautiful bountiful burger!  This mildly 1950s-themed diner is the one inexpensive eatery in Old Town, so I walked in with low expectations but left delighted (and very full). Trying the Texas Burger appears to be almost mandatory among Yelpers, and a very fine burger it is. The bun is toasted, the bacon is crisp, the onion ring is onion-y, the burger is juicy, the BBQ sauce has tang, and the cheese is... kinda there. The fries are fries. I ate them.  The service is service. It gets you fed.  On the whole, it's not quite on a par with a really top-notch Smashburger, but the relief of getting a nice, simple, affordable dinner in that section of Scottsdale lends savor to the meal.

This is so thoroughly the Platonic ideal of froyo that you will leave convinced that there is a Socratic dialogue called De Froites ("On Froyo") in which Socrates disputes with a bevvy of sloe-eyed, honey-skinned young men about whether flavors such as bananas foster and black-sesame are best reserved for philosopher-kings, lest the masses be lured into decadence.  The pistachio froyo is straight up amazing: the perfect blend of sweet-tart, with the flavor of real pistachios. If you fondly remember Jell-O pistachio pudding from your childhood but have become appalled at how sweet and processed it now tastes to you as an adult, have the pistachio froyo. It is the distilled memory of pistachio dessert.  The topping bar is fine -- every place has roughly the same these days -- but the important thing is that this froyo has live cultures, so you can blame your digestive health needs for indulgence here.  Having seemingly sampled every other froyo purveyor in the neighborhood, I can now settle down to concentrate on Yogurtland's plethora of seasonal and unique flavors.

This is the life-changing Smashburger, the Smashburger that leaves other Smashburger locations in the dust (a dust composed of rosemary and sea salt).  i always get the burger with the barbecue sauce, bacon, and onion bits. Before my burger arrives, I believe I am content in other bacon-BBQ-onion-ring burgers I have tried -- and I have left a trail of bacon-BBQ-onion-ring burgers in my wake, as I love and leave bacon-BBQ-onion-ring burgers at a pace that makes observers fear for my cholesterol levels. Then I receive my Smashburger and remember that this is the One True Bacon-BBQ-Onion Burger, the Bacon-BBQ-Onion Burger to rule them all. It's consistently prepared just perfectly -- the bacon is neither too crisp nor too limp -- and the beef always tastes fresh and beefy, not that odd, bland fast-food taste that some places achieve.  The Smashfries are, of course, something between an addiction and an incitement to riot.  It's possible to sit outside, watching the passing students and using the free ASU wi-fi, while pretending that one's at a prestigious New England liberal arts college rather than at the party school of the West. The clerks will bring one's food out. The clerks here are pleasant to the point of being adorable, in a scruffy way.   The only thing that could make this Smashburger more utterly perfect is a beer license AND IT GOT ONE. It is now possible to enjoy Four Peaks brew in a frosty glass. Perfection.

GONE. Closed February 26, 2014.  Apparently reaching the peak of burger-fries-and-beer perfection meant it was too good for this world and had to close.  Let us all hum Don McLean's "Vincent (Starry, Starry Night") as we contemplate the burger goodness that was and wonder what to do for dinner in the College Avenue food-court strip. The Smashburger in Tempe Marketplace is still open, though.

Friendly little store between the Goodwill and Arizona Art Supply. Portions of the stock can vary dramatically from trip to trip, so these four stars are the average of "yup, that's a used-bread store" and "OMG, 24-packs of Gansitos for three dollars!!!!!11!!!1!!"  The notable thing here is that they carry those little bags of Bob's Red Mill flour that usually show up only at organic stores and the chi-chi-mart. I like being able to stop at Goodwill and then pick up fancy flour in a single trip. They also stock jelly, should you want some on your bread.  There is a membership card that will get you free donuts in the fullness of time.

Interior monolog:  "This isn't as great a Dollar Tree as the big one way out in Mesa." "Hmmm... that stacking toy game shaped like chairs would give me a whole restaurant's worth of dollhouse chairs for a buck." "It's kind of a SMALL Dollar Tree." "Wait, it has the 8x8 size brownie mix that Safeway never carries any more." "Even the Dollar Tree on Thomas seems more spacious." "Holy crap -- eye shadow kits. In really nice colors."  Nine bucks later, I think there also might have been cat toys involved.  This is a Very Scottsdale Dollar Tree, so it features carpeting, flatteringly dim lighting, and a sense of hush. The food section is substantially better than the one on Thomas, and housewares isn't bad -- it actually seems to be the Meaningless Tchotchke supply and maybe seasonal that got cut to fit the space. I would come back, if I ever manage to find it again.

Zinnia's is positively the best place to shop if your decorating fantasies were formed by the Max Headroom series back in the late 1980s (and whose among us were not? that show predicted the "hook your vintage manual typewriter to an iPad" look 25 years before it happened) -- it's more urban-ironic and less Victorian-oak-and-Depression-glass than any of the other big antique malls in the region.   It's ground zero for brightly colored vintage lockers (yes, I do envy the people who were able to take some home), mannequins that can be posed ironically, manual typewriters, giant letters from long-defunct signs along U.S. 60, home-made tiki-style furniture, anything Hollywood Regency, and random little things that will be all over trendy home decorating magazines in six months, so get yours now and remind people you were into whatever-it-was before it was big.  Now that the two big antique malls that used to be at 7th Avenue and McDowell are long gone, there's really no other single-point contender for hipster antique mall. You may find niche stores more to your liking elsewhere along 7th Avenue, but the trek should definitely start or end with Zinnia's.

There is something insanely adorable about this shop, and it's not just Charlie the dog (who is a fine, noble hound and will help with getting things from cases).  Zola Bell's is one of the few case-focused antique shops that I really, really like, and that's because the Z in Zola is clearly for ZOMG. As in "ZOMG! Look at all those vintage salt-and-pepper shakers and every last one is cute!" or "ZOMG! An entire wall of vintage toys!" or "ZOMG! SPARKLY!"   If Frances were a vintage/antique shop instead of a handmade-ish/hipster shop...? That's roughly the idea here. Lots of interesting little things, much cute but not excessively twee, some level of rustic but not to the point of involving chickens, many things that will add a level of authenticity to your restored bungalow or some vintage charm to your urban condo but that haven't been over-exposed in every decorating magazine yet... And candy.

Booze, snacks, and hangover remedies.  I wanted to check out a CVS off my usual path. I was dogged by security and staff through the entire store, until they finally herded me out with only two of the items I came here for.  So much for a fun browse that was going to allow me to skip the trek to Target.

This is THE place to go if you're a newbie or shopping for a friend or browsing for a tangentially related hobby. Ordinarily, when I go to a single-hobby shop in the hope of scoring a little something for my weird dollhouses, I get The Sneer because I'm buying only a couple fat quarters of fabric or one skein of yarn or whatever. Not at Gotham City! There is no sneer at Gotham City unless it's part of the comic-book character's official persona.  The clerks got totally into what I was trying to accomplish and the shopping trip ended up with my happily buying more than I'd strictly intended to and taking various flyers for events. They showed me things; they explained things; they gave me not the slightest trouble over not really being a fan of any of the major franchises.   As a result, I have all sorts of neat stuff in the under $10 range, plus a general idea of what more I could get and how and when. Also, my $1 Spiderman figure from a flea market is moving up from house-sitting to having his own house so he can collect the things that aren't right for the 1:6 people or for the hipster ST:TNG couple.  Also, from a prior (very pleasant) visit, I know I can get coffee and cold drinks, including an Italian soda that looks like green slime. There are days when an ice-cold, fruit-flavored glass of green slime is what hits the spot.

Cajun/Mex fusion needed to happen, and the happening couldn't be in better hands.  --Nice people, who go the extra kilometer in giving an ETA on food so that it's possible to chill or browse what's nearby, rather than standing right there and fretting.  --Reasonable pricing in relation to serving size, and reasonable serving size in relation to reality. Seven bucks gets you a breakfast bowl that's filling enough to be the whole breakfast (so you're not stuck blowing $20-$25 across multiple trucks to not starve), but the portion's not so huge that you can't justify a pastry from the market stands if one calls out to you.  --Delicious eggs! Soft, fluffy, and worth every second of the wait time.  --Delicious Cajun rice.  --Heck, delicious everything.  --Did I mention how nice they are?  Also, you get a lollipop as a breath freshener. I'm not sure I intend to lick one, but I'm ridiculously amused by having one.

Size matters. The sheer variety of the stock here makes up for some of its vagaries in stocking.  In recent months, there's been a shift away from retro candies and toward the kind of candies that look imported and exotic but actually are widely stocked by supermarkets. (Since Smeeks also cut back on retro candies, I'm wondering if the concept is more beloved than the actual-buying-that-helps-pay-the-rent.) So lots of familiar names like Lindt and Vosges now appear. The bins have also scaled back on the retro and even dumped the livelier Brachs offerings, though the saltwater taffy selection remains large.   Prices are slightly higher than the same products at Safeway or World Market; but if you're for some reason stuck in downtown Tempe (which you might be, if you're at a conference at ASU) or if you've had too many beers at the many Mill Street bars to remember what Orbit circles a grocery store, Candy Addict is RIGHT THERE and you can stagger in and buy candy that will impress people with its overall coolth.  So it's worth popping in to see if there's anything you want.

The Royal kiosk in Union is a splendidly civilized touch. Go up to the window in a relaxed resort frame of mind, as this spot is tiny, so there's only so much they can do at once. But the setting is one of the prettiest parts of Biltmore, the staff is nice, the coffee is srs bsns coffee... so you owe it to the coffee to savor the moment.

The part I needed cost less than $20 and they still installed it for me just to be nice (or to stop me from making a fool of myself in their parking lot, but really -- think of the laughs they missed by being kind).  I would happily go back to this store often, except I don't really want to need more car parts! Maybe I could collect key rings or something harmless like floor mats.

Until my visit to U-Swirl, I believed there was no such thing as bad froyo. Now I have achieved enlightenment through the path of suffering.  The New York Cheesecake froyo was a translucent mess of ice crystals. The Dulce de Leche had a more convincing texture, but neither had any real flavor. The staff did not make eye contact, possibly from shame.  On the positive side, there is outdoor seating, and it is possible to cadge wifi from the adjoining bagel place.  Unless you're stranded here because your ride won't finish up at My Sister's Closet, go down the block to Yogurtology.

Every city needs a place where middle-income-ish people can buy wedding gifts for their friends who want something a little funky and unusual but who aren't so far out there that they expect their presents to be hand-felted from dryer lint.   The Secret Village is that place. The kitchen-y section in the east building is a scene of major housewares lust, and it's mostly the "ha, you'll think I got this in a little shop in Paris!" sort of dishes rather than the "fine china, once a year" dishes. The west building has the cards you'll need in wrapping presents for your nuptials-bound friends who get the dishes.   The back building is where the boho gifts and tchotchkes live -- upon close examination, the stock is more mass-produced and less exotic than even at the much-lamented Green Woodpecker but since there's nowhere else in Phoenix to even think of finding weird bits of items, how picky can one be?  Go make your friends have celebrations so you can buy them coffee mugs here.

Back when I lived in Minnesota, where Bruegger's was everywhere and Einstein was an exotic, out-of-town treat, I never thought I'd be nostalgic for Bruegger's bagels. Guess what!  This is a cute little store, and the staff is sweet and nice to customers claiming freebies, which is sort of the test of customer service. It serves highly assimilated bagels -- think of them as Reform Bagels rather than Orthodox Bagels -- that are nicely flavorful and chewy on their own Reform Bagel terms. They have added a rosemary olive oil bagel since I left Minnesota, but really, the joy of Reform Bagels is flavors like blueberry. (These bagels are, however, somewhat closer than their roots than Paradise Balery's bagels, which are basically bread in a torus shape. PB bagels, even when delicious, have married out and celebrate Christmas.)  If I worked or lived in this little corner of the Biltmore neighborhood, I'd be sneaking here with my laptop to wallow in strong coffee and honey-walnut cream cheese, while watching the sun turn all the glass buildings copper-colored.

My head a'splode.  The museum consists of about a bajillion action figures, presented in rigid organization but entirely without explanation.  It is the apotheosis of collecting. It is STUFF.  I'm sure there are action figure lines not represented here, but I'm so distracted by Things I Did Not Know Existed that it's hard to care. Did you know there was an entire line of Hogan's Heroes 12" dolls? Well, now you do.  Between them, the GI Joes, and a few other military lines, if Barbie likes men in uniform, she can do better than Ken. Space Camp Barbie -- also present -- probably trained with some of these guys.  From a doll collecting standpoint, the most interesting display is probably the full Be Goth line, though SO MANY comic-book-type series got 12" dolls that there's no lack of stuff of interest.  I'd call it worth the $5, and the staff is very nice.

This is the kind of thrift store where you go in hope of finding something amazing, and either you do, or you leave empty-handed. It's about 2/3 housewares (including furniture) and 1/3 clothes.  The stock is distinctly curated, not the randomness of the Goodwill down the block, so cut glass and crystal are heavier on the shelves than random glassware of randomness. If you're interested in vintage clothing but not up for "vintage" or Buffalo Exchange prices, you may luck out here -- I did.

The froyo is only 90% as amazing as at the Yogurtland across the street but:  1. 90% as amazing as Yogurtland is still amazing.  2. The place is in the food court at Fashion Square, so it's excellent for soothing shattered nerves and a wounded spirit.  3. It has fixings for making a sort of brownie sundae with various cookies on the bottom of the yogurt cup, if you like that sort of thing.  4. Gingerbread froyo was not immediately banished after Christmas, and gingerbread froyo is a good thing.  5. The staff is relentlessly cheerful.  6. Some store's free wifi reaches to the tables out front, so you can geek out with a cup of froyo and pretend you're not stuck in a terrifyingly large shopping mall full of roving gangs of teens, tourists, and trophy wives.

I despise bananas, so it's a mystery why I ordered banana dolce de leche gelato.  But you've already been spoilered by the rating on how this turns out. It was magnificent. I wanted to wallow in it. If I became any more enamored of bananas, I'd be swinging from the trees on the (empty due to extreme heat) Scottsdale Mall.  Whatever I had as the second flavor was fine but not as revelatory. I'm now convincing myself that going all the way to Scottsdale RIGHT NOW for another scoop of the banana dolce de leche gelato would be stupid, that the world does hold other joys, many closer to home and much cheaper.  Be warned that this is going to cost you: it's $5.50 for two tiny scoops on a plain cone. The tininess of the scoops is not so much of a problem when you factor in that this stuff is RICH, and it's much better than any local ice cream.(Waffle cones with larger scoops are now also available.) I don't think the price is unreasonable for the combination of quality and "hey, we're in Old Town Scottsdale, so everything is tourist-priced," but if you're watching your budget, you will be making this up in ramen later. It might actually be worth it... banaaaaannnnnnaaaaaaasssss.  The flavor combos are fascinating. Get a frequent buyer card if you live around here, as even if you have to spread trips over months, there's incentive in trying lots of flavors -- and they tend to be grown-up, foodie flavors.  I found service to be perfectly delightful. If I were toting a couple kids who'd reached the fractious stage of the afternoon (as even good kids sometimes do), I'd take them to the Sugar Bowl instead, though. This shop is very small and really requires sitting still, just due to lack of space, while the Sugar Bowl is larger and more relaxed, with more conventional flavors and serving sizes. (Ironically, I couldn't get a server to even acknowledge me at the Sugar Bowl on the same day, which is how I ended up here.)

The stale fortune cookie was the final insult.  Of course, since I came in alone with a book, I was seated in the darkest dining area next to a table with screaming children. This should have been my sign that the staff already knew I was not their target clientele and were determined to extract my $14 with the least effort to themselves.   Standard Chinese buffet food must come in vast tubs from Sysco, as the Chinese dishes are absolutely identical to the Chinese dishes at every other mediocre buffet in Phoenix. This one appears to have a larger selection of non-Chinese food, including the mysterious pork tamale mentioned by others. It all tastes as if it was poured from its tub into a pan, heated through, and then trotted out to sit on its warming table. If you're determined to stuff mass quantities of food down your gullet, this will probably do the job. If you have the food sensitivity that gives stomach cramps in response to one or another cheap fat or filler, don't even walk in the door. There's fast food elsewhere in the parking lot that'll fill you up for half the price and a fraction of the misery.  The iced tea has no flavor that would confirm it's anything other than maybe used dish water, so I suppose I shouldn't complain about lack of refills. Lack of knives is more of an issue if you're recklessly served yourself a slice of ham, but. . . don't. It should be impossible to eff up buffet ham, but the ham was tasteless, with a bizarre gummy texture. After that, I was not about to try the sushi.  High points for food were the spicy squid whatevers, the breading-and-fish concoctions in assorted seashells (those have to be pretty awful before I don't think they're adorable), and the fake tiramisu squares (standard buffet fare but this was a fresh batch).

Very nice sub and lots of it.  Very nice service.  Honestly, I'm at the point of "you serve food and are making me feel less stressed rather than more so -- DO THAT THING."  A small sub is a substantial nine inches (that sounds dirty), which I consider to be enough for later (that sounds dirty, too).

Stood on line at Willo Street Fair. Dude stopped in the middle of taking my order to do other stuff, generally acted as if it was a pain to serve me, then didn't put my order in to the kitchen. When several people behind me got served, I asked for a refund. When I said they'd lost a customer with this nonsense, dude came back with "Don't be so bitchy."  Guys, you had the option of giving me minimally adequate service. You chose not to. I have no social duty to pretend you were anything other than rude and inadequate from beginning to end.  Next time you don't want a customer to be "bitchy," try taking their order and giving it to the kitchen. This is kind of a minimum requirement of being in food service.

Bins bins bins bins! Most of the store is binned candy in varying degrees of retro-ness or frivolity -- the sorts of chews and hard candies and gummies that belong to a far-off youth (possibly so far off that it's somebody else's youth and not yours).  It is also the only place locally that I can reliably find the caramel swirls and the stained-glass nougats that used to be made by Brach's and sold in supermarket bins (but apparently aren't Brach's products any more). More important in the grand scheme of the cosmos, the chocolate-covered gummi bears are the Albanese bears that have distinct, intense fruit flavors under the chocolate.  The novelty section is cute and (I think) not wholly a product of the Archie McPhee catalog. If you're planning a stroll through Old Town Scottsdale, it's worth crossing the street to get yourself a bag of candy here so you can dole out treats to pacify fretful members of your party.

Jasmine Tokyo's goal is apparently to be the gold standard of Chinese buffet, and it will cost you substantial gold, even with the Yelp 20%-off check-in deal or one of the coupons they send occasionally. Unlike some buffets in the region, the slight queasiness you may feel afterwards is from damage to your wallet, not to your stomach.  SUSHI The sushi section is huge, creative, and good-for-buffet-quality (so, better than supermarket, better than the second-best place on Thomas Road, but not so good as a serious sushi restaurant where it's made right when you order it). If your goal is to fill up on sushi, you will probably come out ahead here. They've also added little plates of sashimi, which in late afternoon were not at their peak. If you come when they're busy and refreshing this a lot, you will probably do better.  MONGOLIAN BBQ It exists. I resist buffet features that require interacting with servers, so I've never tried it, and I veered that direction only to obtain SESAME BALLS and those cheese-covered scallop things in shells. This place has the best sesame balls filled with bean paste. Should I ever decide to invent the Sesame Ball Diet, I will eat here regularly, 30 sesame balls at a sitting.  SALAD AND COLD THINGS Ignore the shrimp, unless it's peak period and being refreshed often. The little spicy squid in the other cold section, however, are excellent. BITE THEY LITTLE HEADS OFF, nibble on they tiny feet!  HOT FOOD The selection here is smaller than at cheaper buffets, so there was only one style of dim sum (pot stickers filled with BBQ pork, I think), none of the usual non-Chinese offerings (possibly not a loss, depending), and a limited array of main dishes. The up side is that the main dishes are mostly restaurant-quality rather than "arrive in a dump truck from buffet central" quality. So it's very non-gloppy, things taste like something other than sauce, and if a dish purports to contain meat, the meat is the major part, not something you have to hunt amidst cheap vegetables. The walnut shrimp is outstanding.  DESSERT Again, I refuse to interact with ice-cream scoopers (and, in fact, I've never seen that station staffed anyway). The serve-yourself selection contains many of the usual suspects and a few surprises. The mango pudding-cake thing is good, but avoid the pineapple cake. There are cheesecake bites! Have a cheesecake bite!  Heck, have another sesame ball! You know you want to.

Welcome to the funkiest place in Goodyear. If you've been craving sheet-metal winged pigs but regretting that Cave Creek is practically a day trip from the west valley, you may feel tempted to lie on the floor and weep tears of joy.  This Armadillo provides fine circuit training for working off breakfast at the Black Bear Diner, including a loft with moderately steep stairs. Like its cousin up toward Metro Center, it's an "antique mall" in the sense of focusing mostly on vintage items and less uncommon antiques, plus a smattering of "collectibles." This is the kind of antique mall I prefer, since it really functions as a sort of fantasy department store for shoppers who have a middle-of-the-road budget but whimsical or retro tastes.  Like the other Armadillo, stock here runs somewhat more to the frilly and ornate than to the mid-century modern, but it's not a total lock-out of swellness in favor of sweetness. Unlike the other one, there's a larger variety of dealers who aren't typical antique-mall fare: things like reproduction hardware, the aforementioned sheet-metal winged-pigs, repro tin signs, garden ornaments made from vintage dishes. This isn't my cuppa, but in context, it provides useful variety, and it fills booths (there are more empty booths here, but it's still fairly new).  A number of dealers seem to actually be replicated here, including the scrapbook store. Also replicated is the cheery professionalism of the operation: clean restrooms, occasional seating areas, efficient check-out, and available snacks. When you're hiking a layout this big, these things come to matter.

Crazed berserker bulk shopping!  WinCo is how a person who lives alone ends up buying enough boneless, skinless chicken breasts to cater a mid-sized wedding, should anybody in my neighborhood need to have a mid-sized wedding. Otherwise, summer 2013 is now the Season of the Chicken Breast. $1.98 a pound, baby!  The bulk section is mind-boggling. It includes mini-ravioli and tortellini. It sells nuts at a price that's not nuts. It offers more varieties of interesting candy than mall stores that specialize in that sort of thing.  As you get into produce, meat, and bakery, bear in mind that this store is designed for middle-class or working-class, large-family, middle-of-the-road shopping. It's about bags of oranges and potatoes, along with blocks of cheddar, massive packs of hamburger or chicken, and eggs in mass quantities. There are "better" mainstream brands (e.g., Deli Selects, Chobani yogurt) and some exotic items like ground buffalo, but if you're looking for the kinds of cheeses found in the deli at Fry's or Safeway, or if you want custom-sliced deli meat, or if you're looking for produce of the quality that Sprouts offers on a good day, WinCo is not that store. (You can, however, buy a whole pig's foot still attached to the leg.)  The canned, boxed, and frozen food sections are seemingly endless and very well-stocked. If you're fit enough to keep pushing that heavy cart for another mile, you can score items that are hard to find. It's the only store I've ever seen to carry the full line of Jiffy muffin mix flavors, including the semi-mythical raspberry (which is probably ghastly, but I feel fulfilled for having been in its presence).  I give WinCo 5 stars because it doesn't pretend to be a chi-chi-mart (and indeed, for fresh produce, I want something nearer to home for frequent trips) and for the middle-of-the-road stock-up shopping that it's designed for, it's superlatively easy, fun, and cheap.

This is the black hole of Qdobi, after which you will be asking yourself why you didn't hold out for the friendly service, authentic cuisine, and upscale atmosphere of Taco Bell.  By the time you're done here, you'll feel the sort of existential despair that's shared only by staff in the Sears shoe department. The place is always empty-ish, always reeking of desperation, always cluttered with a slow-moving line (even if you're the only customer, there will somehow be a slow-moving line), and always fundamentally bland and mediocre, with small portions, too.  It's not even really cheap, other than by comparison to the Scottsdale prices surrounding it. You probably will not die of eating here, but count on having real doubts about whether life is worth living. Also: do not order the pulled pork. It's vile.

GONE! The worst Qdoba on the planet, the blot on the face of Qdobosity, has a hastily inked sign taped to the door announcing: "This store is closed. Thank you for your support."  Goodbye, horrible Qdoba with clerks of apathy and despair! Goodbye, tasteless food served with a side of hopelessness!

Want your froyo with retro hipster flare? This is the froyo for people who think froyo was better before it got popular, and who are now eating their froyo ironically. You may feel out of place if you don't have a Smith Brothers-style beard and some plaid.  It's perfectly nice froyo. I come here to get variants on caramel or cheesecake flavors, as it always has at least one (and not a huge range of flavors otherwise), with caramel sauce and candied pecans. It's the only froyo place where I voluntarily eat inside, as it has hipster ambient music.

Holy credit limit, Batman! Arizona's broken out in an indoor swap meet for comic books, action figures, manga, and collectibles!  This place is more than a little amazing, in a random way. Not all booths are open at all hours, but figure on at least glimpsing a little something related to Star Wars, most of the Marvel comics, a wide variety of recent or popular anime and manga series, vintage toy cars, figures from TV series... my reaction was mixed between "oh yeah, that!" and "they made action figure tie-ins for that?"  The stock is random because these are small dealer/collectors, so what they have to some extent what they've found or what interests them. But the sheer volume of stuff means it's worth checking to see if they have what you're after. (HInt: the more eclectic your tastes or the more gaps in your collection, the more addictive this is likely to be. This is the place where you find the figure that you coveted when you were 8 or 11 or whenever the coveting bug hit, the one that you were starting to think you'd imagined as nobody ever has it on eBay.)  There is an open swap meet on Saturday, where people who aren't regular sellers can rent tables. Legend has it that somebody once marked boxes of rare-ish vintage comics $5 for the box. Legend has it that he sold out in roughly 20 minutes. This could happen again. Keep the bat sensor tuned to make sure you're there.  One star off because all but one seller -- alas, the one who wasn't carrying anything I hyperventilate over! though I may have to change that -- acted as if my being female made me invisible. They do not know... my secret identity is The Silent Shopper! My superpower is attracting bargains!

There are two reasons I decided I live too far from Potbelly to get take-out again.  1. The ambience is really nice -- low-key, lots of wood, free wi-fi, cheerful customer service -- so it seems a shame not to enjoy it. I sense that eating here would soothe nerves shattered by particularly lively shopping sprees at Nordstrom Rack.  2. My sandwich smelled so good that I had to resist unwrapping it and eating it in the car. Repeatedly.  This is not your heaped-with-meat New York deli-style sandwich: those are usually at the $8-and-up price point rather than $5 price point. That said, the meat is much better quality than what Subway offers: the taste says "oh, hai Martha Stewart!" rather than "cheap lunch."  So this place has great potential as an economical yet gracious spot for lunch.

In the chaos of the Walmart/Home Depot power strip, there is a source of peace, a source of balance, a source of Thrifty ice cream.  At $1.85 for a generous single scoop on a plain cone, the ice cream is thrifty. It is also Thrifty, in the sense of being the last lingering reminder of the award-winning drug-store ice-cream brand.  Thrifty ice cream is a straightforward ice cream, from the days before add-ins and ripples and limited editions. If you are looking for a mid-century modern ice cream to soothe your hipster sensibilities, Thrifty is that ice cream. It does not come in flavors like lobster or "moose tracks" or anything involving puns. The most exotic flavor is strawberry cheesecake. But it is truly fine ice cream. The butter pecan -- a fine MCM flavor that I ordinarily find insipid -- is deliciously buttery and convincingly pecan.  I strongly recommend arming oneself with a cone before braving the screaming chaos of any of the stores in that strip. The clerk when I visited was very nice and possibly the only ice-cream scooper who has ever grasped how to exchange cone for money without making the cone-buyer feel klutzy and awkward.

The beer menu at the Angel's Trumpet exerts the sort of fascination over me that the Dairy Queen's 20-30 possible milkshake flavors did when I was a wee urchin and DQ still had goodies like pineapple milkshakes. There are about 30 flavors on the big board at any time, and it includes "weird" varieties like chicory stout (which was splendid), along with all sorts of microbrews. I cannot possibly actually drink enough to fully appreciate what this place has to offer.  If you're there for food, the ideal is to hit the happy medium of "a bit of buzz, a bit of clatter" but stop short of showing up when it's jammed and the servers are starting to look panicky. My first trip hit that medium perfectly (little did I know!) with the result that my Outlaw Burger was Revelatory!Burger, OMG!Burger, SeraphimSingPraises!Burger. It was every juicy, flavorful thing a medium pub burger should be. And in that context, the space is really cool -- it's like a coffeehouse in that there's a sense of community gathering regardless of which specific party you're with.  My second trip was on a swamped day, and my medium burger was well-done. The kitchen's still working with quality ingredients -- the buns are very fine buns -- so even a meh burger is still a pretty good burger and worth the $9. But flights of angels did not actually sing over this burger.  On the up side, the kitchen positively coated the ribbon chips with red and black pepper, and since I love spicy food, that was so far beyond amazing that I considered asking for more, then decided not to push my luck.  Rumor has it that one can ask for take-out and trot the food across the street to FilmBar.

My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba, with fewer meat choices (no carnitas!). The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixings.  It was a long look, as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me. After a long while, one gal pointed me out to another, who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill. At this point, I gave up and left.  The idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management, so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff. But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting, then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition. There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chance.  I went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there.

My reaction to Potbelly is always "so small," followed swiftly by "so good!" If you're looking for a direct Subway substitute, Potbelly will come across as pricey. If you're looking for an alternative to chi-chi $8-$10 sandwiches, Potbelly uses highly respectable ingredients and has a wheat roll that toasts up delicious.  The Wreck is a truly fine sandwich, nicely filled and tasting like cold cuts I would not be embarrassed to buy at the supermarket.  The environment is also a bit more soothing than many sub shops: it's all earth-tones and wooden chairs, so there's a sense of relaxing.  The clerks are cheerful even under the pressures of customers with truly peculiar orders.

The world has gotten better since the era when I first started flying for business, when a good airport dinner meant White Russians and warmed-over hotdogs.  The food isn't quite on a par with the main restaurant, but it'd still qualify as good restaurant food. A burger is a respectable upscale burger that I'd call pleasant yet unmemorable... but the fries! The fries! The fries are even more addictively amazing that Smashburger fries. Whoever was in the kitchen is the maestro of fries. Whoever's choosing their wine is also brilliant. Given usual mark-ups, my choice is probably pretty cheap in the bottle, and it had the dimensions of something much pricier.  The push from 4 stars to 5 was that I went here hoping that an airport might have servers familiar with the concept of "lone woman diner," so I'd get decent service. My server was wonderful: present without being obtrusive, helpful, and generally everything I could ask in a server. She got a 33% tip. That won't pay anybody's rent, but it's better than an empty table.  It's great living in the future.

Here's the plan. You have a friend who likes adventurous, flavorful food but who just can't quite manage to like "mediterranean" food. You will take the friend to Juba. You will order for that friend the Chicken Shawarma meal. You will see your friend like Mediterranean food.  Or we could drop the pseudonyms and you could buy me some chicken shawarma. The spicing is somehow different from what I've had at Greek restaurants, and I like it better. On some future visit, I may try the goat, though I've had goat before elsewhere, so I don't get Adventurous Points for eating goat any more.  Entrees run about $11-$12, so for a dive ethnic restaurant, this isn't cheap-cheap, but the portions are gluttonously huge. The chicken shawarma is at least the poultry bulk of a healthy Cornish game hen, served on what I would consider to be a week's supply of very nice rice. There is also a frill of salad and a puddle of respectable hummus, with pleasant pita.  Service is sweet-natured and pleasant, and if you're bored during the short wait, you can read the free Pakistan West newspaper and decide that you really need to go to Pakistan to ride the Karachi Circular Railway when it's rebuilt.

DOSA.  I would come to the lunch buffet just for this, as I feel no more than a mild affection for the usual naan but a mad passion for dosa.  The other reason to come here -- second only to dosa -- is that the chef is not yet jaded by preparing endless tubs of chicken tikka masala, so he experiments and he broadens the range of culinary styles available at buffet time.   It's usually a safe bet to find the aforementioned chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, some variety of biryani, something vegetarian, rice pudding, gulab jamun, and carrot halwah. So the seekers of comfort food can feel secure.  You can also luck into tandoori fish, egg bhurji (what scrambled eggs dream of becoming), a Tamil coconut pudding, CORN FRITTERS, and numerous varieties of curry-type-things that are not sold in foil packets at Big Lots. Every trip, we end up doing play-by-play and color commentary as we go down the buffet line, because it is like opening presents. What will it be today? Egg biryani? The thing with the green beans?   Positively my favorite Indian buffet, and the owner is charming.

If this hardware store contains a portal to a happy alternate universe where unicorns romp, home repairs are performed with effortless competence, and anything big attracts a buff, shirtless handyperson of one's preferred gender and orientation... this would not surprise me. It is more packed with stuff than an old curiosity shoppe and even sells live chickens.  I didn't wander this time because I was doing a string of errands while carrying my huge tote bag that justifiably makes store clerks nervous (I could swipe a small tractor in this thing). Instead, I was greeted and helped by a young man who comprehended what I wanted, had an intelligent answer for my questions, and handled my cluelessness without treat in me as stupid (an art in itself).  It carries both widgets and sparkly home decor things, and it's between a Tuesday Morning and a huge 99 Cents Only, so there's every reason to make this a destination rather than staring blankly at the aisles of Home Depot.

These dumplings will haunt my dreams. They may be the first really good Chinese food I've had in Phoenix (other than the place up on Bell, which is a haul).  They're definitely fried potstickers, not actual bao (steamed buns), but very, very good fried potstickers, with a juicy pork-shrimp filling (be cautious on the first bite -- they squirt) and a nicely fried-but-not-too-greasy exterior.  If you have doubts about being upsold to try the iced tea, swallow them. The tea is incredible. The tea falls like gentle rain from heaven upon your palate.  Service is also completely excellent -- they are up-front about food taking some prep time and make an effort to treat every customer well.  So the food's excellent... be aware that in Phoenix-land, "food truck" and "cheap" really don't intersect unless you've found a taco truck from before the hipster food truck craze. I was a little surprised to pay $8 for just 5 potstickers... and then found other Yelpers bemoaning paying $7 for 6. They're still really amazing potstickers, so I'd do it again.

Sipping plum wine is one of the pleasures of civilization; adding a basket of wonton chips pushes it delicately over the cliff to decadence.  Embrace the decadence. Bring a party of four to share dishes, sip plum wine, and discuss the Xiaobi Tangji of Yuan Hongdao. Or if Chinese poetry of the Ming Dynasty doesn't do it for you, there are large-screen TVs which were showing Muppet-like programming when I was there, and which probably turn to sports at some later time. Have a little kung fu with your egg foo.  I had the ginger chicken. For a moment, I thought I was in one of the intellectual suburbs of Boston, where the Chinese restaurants are moderately elegant (this one is, in a reddish-peach scheme) and the food is, too. Only the lack of long-haired fellow diners arguing over Ming Dynasty poetry clued me in that no, this is Scottsdale. The dish was more subtly flavored than the usual local Chinese, without being bland. While it was not the most amazing Chinese I've ever had in my life (that involved oysters at a dive restaurant in a West Coast Chinatown), the combination of bistro-style food and attentive service makes Qwik Chinese a soothing retreat from the chaos of Scottsdale rush hour traffic.  I would write haiku to this ginger chicken, except that haiku is Japanese, so it can be written only to sushi or teppanyaki.

If I'd stumbled over this burger stand, which appears to have crossed the temporal barrier from a 1960s where Phoenix was much more sophisticated, on my own, I'd be having a five-star rave over how it's the most amazing thing ever.  Having had it recommended as the most amazing thing ever by a foodie web site, I'm feeling distinctly three-star-ish. So split the difference, as the place is well-intentioned in a flustered way, and neighborhoods need good hamburger joints.  Certainly, it was the best-smelling burger in recent memory. You get two thin, seared patties that are most definitely well-done. Any juiciness comes from the Russian dressing, the tomato, and really first-rate pickles. The fries were workmanlike, if lukewarm. When twilight falls and the Muzak plays Pink Floyd, you will eat the fries anyway.  Y'know... same price as fast food, hipster ambience... I'd eat here again simply because you don't find yourself soaked in grease and self-loathing at the end of the meal.

If you can, go early and move fast, as the lines get painfully long by noon. That's a good thing for enthusiasm for home restoration, right? There are free trolleys that run in loops around the tour sites, for times when the experience starts seeming a little... vigorous.  The 2015 tour had 10 houses plus some art studios. The highlight was the historic firehouse because really, what else is as cool as an old firehouse? Not that there aren't fascinating features to the regular houses -- it's a kitchen, bath, and patio extravaganza with many nifty features. Home ages this year ranged from 1930 into the early 1940s, plus one 1999 "new old" house.  Like some of the 2013 reviewers, I thought I remembered there being more houses, with more variety, in previous years; but it's still really cool. There's also a street fair (in which literally 1 in 5 passersby was telling a companion how street fairs are different in Minnesota) and food trucks. It's a pleasant walk, and one gets to feel smug about how, though street fairs in Minnesota might be larger, in February, they would be buried under the snow.

I swoon at the pizza crust. Ordinarily, pizza crust is something I tolerate for the sake of the toppings. A crust generally deemed "excellent" merely ratchets me to a higher level of grudging tolerance. THIS crust is my crust of crusts. I did not want to stop eating it, and I'm a person who can stop eating and ignore actual chocolate, for heaven's sake!  The Old Man & the C cocktail is Happy Juice. Never have I been so filled with bonhomie. There are major pharma companies who wish they could bottle this effect.  Service is delightful and charming. This is such a pleasant little place in the vast Escher-esque wasteland of Camelback Esplanade. I used to mourn the loss of the Italian place at 16th Street near Indian School, but SOLO far surpasses it, at about the same price point.

The sign proclaiming "best breakfast burrito" lured me in.  "So you have the best breakfast burrito?" I said to the dude at the counter.  "Well," said he, "we haven't tested it against all other burritos."  I assured him this was okay, as I wasn't doing a scientific study. I ordered the chorizo burrito, which is $4.40.  It is a large burrito, really more a burro, containing chorizo and scrambled eggs. No nonsense with onions or tomatoes -- you got your chorizo, you got your eggs. This is how it should be. The tortilla tasted fresh, and the chorizo/egg ratio was generously tilted toward chorizo, though the chorizo had a few odd gristly bits. As served, it was a better-than-average breakfast burrito... and with a drizzle of the salsa verde, it was a truly fine breakfast burrito. If I lived down in this neck of the woods, I'd be back to try more flavors.  The place is a little dive hole-in-the-wall in a rural plaza where there are hay bales in the parking lot and the shop next door sells live chickens. You can get the free Gilbert newspaper from the rack out front and entertain yourself with the police blotter and the local restaurant inspection grades.

The Refuge takes its name seriously: it is the most soothing of the many coffeehouses in roughly this neighborhood. It features -- prominently -- staff who are not sullen hipsters, but who are sweet and charming and helpful. It also features bizarre and wonderful coffee drinks -- lavender and chili peppers figure in them, though not in the same drink -- and a wine/beer liquor license. The spirit is distinctly soothed.  Food quality varies widely enough to keep it at a 4-star rating. The breakfast burrito is so meh that when the counter clerk somehow misunderstood my vague babbling and ordered up a breakfast sandwich for me instead, I ended up grateful and delighted, as the breakfast sandwich turns out to be much better, with lots of butter and nice soft eggs. Henceforth, I am ordering the breakfast sandwich on purpose. Pastries similarly run from the meh to the sublime, but they're priced reasonably enough to not trigger severe buyer's remorse, and they seem to change fairly often, too.  The coffee is apparently brewed for use in the amazing coffee drinks, so when consumed straight, over ice, it will put hair on your chest and, should you have any minor ailments that are ameliorated by application of caffeine, you will experience a miracle cure. I have no problem with this (it took my headache right away), but you need to be in the right mood for coffee that slaps you in the face.  The setting is industrial-bungalow-chic, with local art, free wifi, and a nice patio. I believe this is run by Catholic Charities, which may explain the effort to create an aura of spiritual peace.

I'd enjoyed Joe's Diner in its old location and was feeling good about checking it out in its newer, more convenient spot. Huge portions, good food, good service, what's not to like?  After I'd waited a while at the "please wait to be seated" sign, a server called out that she'd get to me in a minute, then went off to take the order of a large table. Okay, maybe they'd been waiting a while, and if you don't get that in to the kitchen, things bog down. Then another server came over and asked which of us in the foyer was first. "Me," I said. The father with two kids behind me said: "She is."  The server then looked right past me, picked up three menus, and went to seat the party behind me, the same party that was clearly puzzled and embarrassed to be seated first when they'd said it was my turn.  My strong suspicion, since I'm very tall and had gone for retro-glam in high-heeled mules and a large hat, was that the staff jumped to the erroneous conclusion that I was either a drag queen or transgender. That's an excellent reason for me to not spend money there: I live in a queer-friendly neighborhood because I like those values (whether I need them to apply to me or not) and there are plenty of places I'm more comfortable supporting.

KAK is the most consistently delightful thing about Union at the Biltmore. For $1.50, you get an adorable macaron, served with charm and humor.  Depending on the time of day, your macaron may be nearer to (or further from) its peak of frothy freshness... which I think is an argument for buying at least two, one in the flavor you originally intended and one in a "wild" flavor where the sheer novelty is part of the payoff.  The gift boxes are a reasonably priced way to impress the hard-to-shop-for, and even after three days in Priority Mail, I've gotten raves.

Pleasing pizza prepared promptly.  For about $8, you get a thin-crust pizza in that 11" size that's either enough for two people with small appetites (or with side salads) or just a bit into the gluttony range for one person. The ingredients are beyond the usual pizza selection, though they haven't yet gone so far as to revive the sadly mourned Piezano's apple-walnut-honey pizza. There is, however, a steak with bleu cheese pizza that I'm probably going to try next time.   As a neighborhood pizza joint with a pleasant -- if slightly post-apocalyptic -- atmosphere and a wine/beer license, Fired Pie does fine. In mood, it's an exact match with the "oops, we dropped some condos here, guess we're a city now" feel of CenPho, so other than the trot across the parking lot, you may never notice that you've left your kitchen. There's also a Starbucks along the mall if you want an after-dinner cup of coffee and a cake pop.

The quality of the food has slipped enough that I almost don't care what's happened with the service. Almost. I care enough to update my review.  I went on a Saturday for lunch. Restaurant was almost empty except for the 30-something man ahead of me in line, who was an object of fascination to the 40-something female clerk working the ingredients line. Maybe his daily visits are the highlight of her lonely existence. Maybe he's Clark Kent. Maybe they dated, back when she was a wealthy socialite, but he won't recognize her existence now that she's reduced to making personal pizzas. Maybe she was his nanny and hopes he'll recognize her. Maybe he's an eligible bachelor who has promised to marry the woman who makes him a perfect pizza.  Certainly, she was trying to make him the perfect pizza. She lavished ingredients on his pizza while picking pieces off mine to make sure I didn't get one single extra piece of sausage. Not one! Gotta protect those profit margins! The result is that I've had $1 frozen personal pizzas with more generous topping distribution. (And yet, the resulting pizza was still greasy, underdone at the middle, and burnt at the edges.)  I'd been planning to order a glass of wine, but I figured with the care taken to not overload my pizza, the restaurant's margins were already well-protected. I'd also planned to tip, but by the time the clerk cooed Mr. Wonderful's name to call his order but snarled mine impatiently because I wasn't lingering by the counter but had gone to get a table, that also was a non-starter.  The whole time, the young female manager was training another staff member within earshot but was apparently okay with it all.  I'm clean, quiet, modestly dressed, and prepared to tip. I have all my teeth, no running sores, and nothing that suggests infectious disease. If I'm by myself, I aim for hours when the restaurant isn't busy, so that I'm not taking up a two-top that's in demand for parties of two (or, worse, a four-top in demand for parties of four). I'm getting really tired of condescending, judgmental clerks for whom even that's not good enough. Y'all are waitstaff at middle-class restaurants, so you have NOTHING to be snobby about.

This has the potential to be one of the great Goodwills.  It is large. It is well-lit. It is jam-packed with stuff. While there are a lot of Target brands on the racks, there's also an encouraging scattering of Old Navy, J Crew, Calvin Klein, and other name brands. The household section is ripe for fantasies about decoupaging one's first apartment.  Time your visit carefully. Noon on Saturday is a Hobbesian scrimmage for dressing rooms. Wear opaque tights and leotard so you can try on clothes in the aisle, and keep a firm grip on your original clothes, as the aisles are tight. My next trip will be at dawn or something.  To soothe your shattered nerves, the water store in the same plaza has Thrifty ice cream at just over $1 for a single scoop.

Do not ignore the pattern of bad reviews merely because the concept of a pumpkin-cheesecake donut was crying out to you "eat me! eat me!" and it seemed like a good idea to not tackle Ranch Market on an empty stomach.  At 7:30 on Sunday morning, the store was empty of customers, the case was full of donuts, and my pumpkin-cheesecake donut was stale, while the coffee tasted burnt. Clearly, they were prepared for a lot more people to have shown up much earlier.  On the up side, the staff was very nice and the place was clean. I would happily go buy donuts from these same people if they could provide donuts that taste fresh.

Here is the paradox of the Fry Bread House. You want to eat your fry bread while it's sizzling hot and freshly puffed, at which point it is light, airy, and gently crisp -- a superlative fry bread that leaves many other fry breads deflated with shame at not measuring up to its texture. At the same time, eating in is likely to harsh your buzz, as the restaurant has the eerie dive-iness of a place that's kept scrupulously clean but that's too big to be properly lit and decorated on the available budget.  My suggestion would be to stop by before a show at the nearby Rhythm Room, get your fry bread "to go," hustle back to the venue at top speed, and eat your piping hot fry bread on the picnic tables before the doors open.   I ordered mine with beans and cheese, and these are fine beans. Now I'm torn between wanting another savory round with many things heaped on it (bring on the chorizo!) and wanting to try 'em with sweet toppings.

So I was wandering downtown, vaguely pretending to be in Europe, when I looked down a side street and saw neon proclaiming "piazza locale." I thought to myself: "If I were actually in Europe, that's where I'd have dinner -- the little place down the side street, not the big tourist scene." So I did that thing.  The pizza is incredible. Pure tomato flavor in the sauce. Speck. Speck is good. There is the promise of anchovies on other pies. Interesting flavor combos, crusts to crawl over broken glass for, wine recommendations that actually work, and staff who are helpful and attentive in a soothing way.   Having generated leftovers in a stylish box, I will smile at two more meals this weekend. Prices are extremely reasonable for artisanal pizza in a pleasant environment.

I wished for a burger-and-drinks joint across from the Central Library, then I looked across the street, and there was Pizza People with a sign proclaiming "Burgers"!  And a very fine burger it was. The Encanto Burger is a nice fat burger with a weirdly fascinating flavor profile that I attribute to the date BBQ sauce. Date BBQ sauce may be one of the best weird things to come out of Arizona. Either it's ordinarily served medium or I exude the aura of a woman who's going to order "medium" to such an extent that servers just know.  The beer and wine lists are short and cute, and there are assorted WTF mixed drinks of the sort served by hipster restaurants, including one that involves pepperoncini (I did not try that). I sort of need to try an almond old-fashioned on the next trip, especially if there's apple pie running loose again. The apple pie is served in mason jars and has crust so best that it gets past my crust-hating nature.  The patio gives a splendid view of light rail coming and going from the McDowell light rail stop, so it's an excellent place to feel urban on a warm evening.

Pearly Mae's is your grandmother's attic, assuming your grandmother was a Hollywood diva who served with the WACs in WWII, commuted to Paris (where she had a pied-a-terre with her third husband, a member of Hungarian royalty twenty years her junior) during her career, and ultimately retired to Arizona to break horses. Her dude ranch served a lot of casseroles, requiring an amazing supply of now-vintage Pyrex.  Most of us need to put in the effort at being 20% more fascinating, just to keep up with Pearly Mae's.  Things I remember:  --Acres of sparkly vintage jewelry. If I once start looking seriously at rings there, I'm going to end up with my fingers too encrusted in sparklies to type.  --Hats. Highly respectable hats. Also an entire room full of shoes. And another room of menswear.  --Bright colored satin-y and silk-y dresses in patterns and styles that I can't even place, but they speak the international language of "the party didn't start until I got here." Most also appeared capable of covering enough real estate that one doesn't have to be age nineteen and size two in order to exude fabulousness.  --Pyrex-mania! If you think you can't find a Pyrex pattern that would go with your kitchen, stop in here and be proven wrong.  --The sort of sofa that settles into your living room with a little flirtatious shrug and is all "helloooo, end tables!"  There was a good deal more, but you get the idea. Pearly Mae is clearly related to Auntie Mame... life is a banquet, and so's the range of stock here.

My new theory is that McDonald's is developing animatronic workers to replace humans but hasn't gotten the artificial intelligence module to work right.  The single star is not for serving McDonald's food, as if you're considering eating here, you've already signed on for that, know what to expect, and are mostly interested in the fries anyway.  The single star is because Waiting for Godot makes logical forward progress faster than the staff here. Any deviation from the program baffles them.  For instance, the corporate overlords added a value menu item to compete directly with Burger King's bacon double cheeseburger. Hint: when a customer orders it with the BK name, this is a GOOD thing. It means the strategy is working. Do not go all blue-screen-of-death until the customer comes up with the exact Mickey Dee's trademarked name. Then, when asked what's on it, don't require multiple reboots to deal with the question.  Most important, when you realize you have put a to-go order on a tray instead of in a bag, PUT IT IN A BAG and deliver it to the customer. Do not decide this is too complex to cope with and leave it sit back in the food prep area until the customer gets tired of waiting and asks about it. When asked, do not go all eye-rolling. It is your JOB to deliver people's orders correctly and in a timely manner. You screwed up. Say "I'm so sorry" (yes, we both know you have no emotion module, but fake it) and fix it.  Additionally, do not fill the unsweet tea dispenser with sweet tea. I like McDonald's sweet tea, but I like it when I have poured myself sweet tea, not when I deliberately avoided it because there'd be plenty of sugar in my (now lukewarm) pie.  The new restaurant design is impressive, in the manner of late 1990s federal courthouses, and this one has a McCaf√©. However, it's possible that it's all some sort of perverse performance art or social experiment, as this location is not listed on McDonald's official site.

I have discovered the answer to life, the universe, and everything, and Douglass Adams was wrong about 42.  It is the fig-bleu cheese caramel. For you, it may be the red jelly things or the fleur de sel caramels or the bacon popcorn. But it's in there somewhere, waiting for you.  The owner is totally charming, probably more than I appreciated (I'd botched my schedule and was mostly panting with relief about getting what I'd come for) -- I bet you could successfully start a conversation about candy. On my next trip, I might.  This is not candy that you pour into a bowl and nibble idly in handfuls. It is candy that you eat one piece at a time, in a proper statse of contemplation to appreciate your relationship to the candy and the candy's relationship to the universe and how that then creates a bridge between the universe and you. Feel free to quote Proust if you like, or your favorite lines from Grand Budapest Hotel.  The thing is, the candy actually justifies that level of intentionality and intentness, with flavor combos that are outright witty. One piece satisfies for quite a long time, as it provides much to think upon. (If you're on a diet and limiting yourself to one candy a day, come here! All other candy will pale by comparison anyway.)   This doesn't mean you shouldn't stock up, as you'll want some to give to other people, who will thank you profusely.

Waited to be seated in near-empty restaurant. Waited. Waited. Staff walked past me as if I were not there. As I walked out, staff rushed to seat party behind me.  I double checked that neither my hair nor my outfit were especially scary.  If it's your policy not to serve women over 35 dining alone, just put a sign in the window or something.

Bookstore with a wine/beer license and a large supply of cards, gifts, and novelties... there is no possible down side to this. It is arguably the best thing to happen in the pursuit of community and civic life in this part of Phoenix.  This is part of the Newton complex, which went in where that steakhouse died back before the Great Recession. The building rehab is really appealing -- it has modernist lines with a lot of natural-feeling materials and tons of light, so it's like somebody's fantasy of life in the woodsier bits of the California coast.  The book selection is kind of hipster-curated, so if you're living or aspiring to the hipster lifestyle (and if you aren't, why are you in CenPho?), you will find everything you need to read, ever, and will never again be lost at a cocktail-party conversation or book club meeting. Play your cards right, and you may be the person recommending the hottest hipster texts. (And if you actually need anything non-hipster-approved, which you don't, you'll want to hide it on your e-reader anyway, so you'll get it from Amazon.)  The novelty selection more than fills the aching void left by the departure of Smeek's, and there are even a few exotic candies.  The goodies served at the coffee bar are locally sourced, as well as being delicious, and some are vegan. Also, there's a happy hour.   Everybody who works there seems to be super-nice. You will ride your single-gear bicycle here at least once a week, and you will remember these years as the best of your life.

Paquime is the epicenter of the Sunnyslope Sunday Breakfast dilemma. Next door is the coffeehouse that has better coffee and the Blueberry Spiral Rolls of Delight. But Paquime has three weapons to suck a really hungry person in:  1. Breakfast tortas! The chorizo breakfast torta is pretty much the best breakfast idea in the universe, beating out now-familiar breakfast burritos. It has chorizo and maybe beans and definitely peppers, and it will make smoke come out your ears.  2. Full menu served at breakfast time. So if you need fish tacos at 9 a.m., you can have fish tacos at 9 a.m. (There is also menudo on Sundays.)  3. Best Mexican pastries I've ever had. I'd gotten a little jaded on the Mexican-pastry front, but these are fresh! And huge!   Now, the reason you want to go here, rather than to the much divier -bertos across the parking lot is that both the food and the environment are rather more chi-chi (while still being quite affordable). All things -berto's are for when you want a honkin' big burrito on a foam plate, with a plastic fork, before you go to Lowe's (or after a long night at the bars). Such moments exist, and they are real.  Paquime is for when you want a quietly civilized meal, with quality ingredients, on real plates, but the prospect of hauling yourself to Gallo Blanco is too onerous, expensive, and precious to contemplate. They also do take-out, should you prefer your civility at home but not want to fire up the skillet.

This Jimmy John's replaced the Worst Chipotle in the Universe, so now, for roughly the price that used to get you lukewarm and poorly prepared Mexican food delivered with a sullen attitude, you can receive a pleasant sandwich served swiftly, with a smile and a cookie.  JJ's is roughly what would happen if Warren Buffet read Douglas Adams' Mostly Harmless -- the one with the sandwiches and the Perfectly Normal Beasts -- and decided that herein lay the future of putting meat between two pieces of bread. The chain decor cannot quite decide if it's preparing guests for their MBAs with plaques of how-to-succeed advice or if it's trying to be funky and in-joke-y and hipster. Your concentration is better devoted to your sandwich.  An 8" sandwich runs in the neighborhood of $5, or a bit under $9 with a drink and your choice of chips, pickle, or large cookie. So it's not quite as cheap as Subway, but it's a lot better. Take the bread. JJ's bread is not a spongy substance that can be mistaken for a yoga mat. It's more like a fresh bolillo or perhaps an elongated kaiser roll. It tastes like actual bakery bread. The meat, similarly, tastes like deli meat, not like meat you'd pick up from the refrigerator section of the dollar store. The portions are not huge, but they're in line with what you'd get at very similar Potbelly or from an $8.50 deli sandwich (no drink, no chips, no pickle, no cookie) from AJ's. Since the meat's just as good as the AJ's sandwich and the bread's better, I'd go with JJ's over AJ's.  The cookie also is comparable to AJ's cookies from the bins, but larger. It's not the greatest cookie you'll ever eat in your life, but it's better than many of the cookies at the Paradise Bakery next door.  Service is so fast that my sandwich, completed and wrapped, hit the counter while I was still deciding on my cookie.  So essentially, a JJ's sandwich will not be a life-changing New York deli experience, but the place is staffed by hoopy froods who know where their towels are, and you can count on its being mostly harmless.

The nicest clerks are always on duty when I stop in.  Being a DG, it's basically what would happen if Walmart opened a convenience store in a low-security prison ("Attention shoppers! Your activities ARE being monitored on video!") except that everybody is nice and it's usually possible to find things.  If you know what the things you buy usually cost, it is possible to get actual bargains on actual name brands. The snack food selection is where I've done best, but I may just be very, very focused on snack food. As always with dollar stores, check labels: if the cheese-like substance seems too cheap to be cheese, that's probably because it isn't. But I've done fine on branded frozen foods on the kind of day when you just want to buy a thing and go home and not deal with a full-sized grocery store. And I got amazing bargains on holiday baking supplies.  Be sure to check the close-out bin near the front, as every life needs its exposure to odd foods bought for 50 cents or less.

My original intent was to go to Smashburger, but the lure of a build-your-own pizza place was irresistible.  It's very nice pizza, and for an extra buck or so, you can get large shrimp on it. Having done so once, I don't think I'd do the shrimp again -- but they do have the ingredients to do an Austrian ham-and-corn pizza, and I recall they can come close to reproducing the apple-walnut pizza that was so good at Piezano's back in the day.  Staff is adorable, ambience is your basic industrial chic.

Manna donuts of heaven! Not just amazing flavor combos (orange glaze with pistachio FTW) but really well-made donuts served by charming and delightful people in the geographic center of cuteness.  It is impossible to get enough of these donuts.

Completely adorable store! The stock is a mix of vintage finds and reproductions, so you either need to know what's what (to make sure you're getting a "find") or not really care (because it's cute and $20 and you deserve it, and you're not going to run all over Phoenix looking for another).  The location is where Smeeks used to be, and as a housewares-focused neighbor to Francis, this shop is perfect. It has much the same "like Anthropologie but 12x more authentic" vibe. Nice, nice people in charge, and it's just a fun place to be.

Today, I ate the most amazing burger in the history of burgers, a burger that any cow would be glad to contribute to. This is not a budget burger -- for the "under $10 dinner," I'm still all about the Smashburger -- but it's a burger worth budgeting for.  My original reasoning was that The Counter is in a really handsome historic building, one that's fascinated me for years. I figured "custom built burger" would be like Fuddruckers. No. No. It is "like Fuddruckers" only in the sense that a luxury golf course is "like" a sparse patch of front lawn or Saks is "like" JC Penney.  First and most important, The Counter tackles the concept of "custom" with fervor. Your burger can be beef, chicken, tuna, veggie-veggie, and I think a couple of things I forgot. You can have it on a bun of several varieties (including gluten-free) or as a salad. There are SIXTEEN cheese possibilities (including a vegan one) and twenty-six sauces. And that's before you even get to the veggie toppings. If you're innately indecisive, bring some dice to roll for your burger's capabilities. (If you're innately geeky, calculate the permutations and make a chart for working your way through them.)  Second, the burger is jaw-droppingly excellent. I had beef on a whole-grain bun with nicoise olives and spicy pickles, with some form of Italian dressing. The first bite was a revelation. As I got to the last quarter of my burger, I kept delaying because I didn't want it to be over. I like burgers, but I do not ordinarily get this blissed-out over a burger.  Third, there is craft beer. That's almost mandatory in Phoenix these days, but it'd be a loss if it weren't there.  Fourth, the service is outstandingly charming. I love staff who walk the walk on being so good that you'll WANT to tip generously (as I did) rather than discriminating based on stereotypical expectations about tipping.  Fifth, I was so blissed-out by the burger that I gave a thumbs-up to key lime pie on my waiter's suggestion, and it was quite a fine pie. I will now be living on beans and wads of lettuce for the rest of the week, while exercising vigorously, but it was worth it.  Eat here. Bring dice.
