Three brats went on a joy ride in their stepdad's truck and hit my Jeep.  Of course the vehicle wasn't insured and of course the parent's didn't take responsibility.  To add insult to injury, the police officer at the scene convinced me to allow the boys off and the mother of the driver to pay the deductible.  Lesson learned: She never did this.  She threw me after much chasing $500 and my Jeep was totaled.  So for two years I saved to repair my well retained immaculate YJ which was ruined.    She looks almost new.  I am so happy that US Auto Body and Paint is around to number 1: take my payments and allow me two years to put my paint job on "Lay-Away" and 2: do a no pun intended, "Bang-up" job on my Jeep.  She's restored salvage and now though I'll never have a Jeep that isn't salvage, at least I'll have a Jeep that's pretty.  Thank you very much.  Professional, courteous, and so reasonably priced.

First time here, they did exactly what I asked for... which has NEVER happened before and I have asked several salons over the years with no one understanding so I gave up.    I had a job interview scheduled and needed to fix my peeling cracked nails but have them look professional and not noticeable.  I asked for clear tips with all pink product and short squared off nails.  They came out PERFECT and were a complimentary tone to my skin.  Needless to say, I was able to be expressive in my job interview without worrying that my nails would be the center of attention...  HOWEVER, a woman who left the salon was just getting her 4th of July holiday nails done and they looked KILLER; little flags on each finger and for the thumbs and big stones, flags with rhinestones.  So cute!  I can't wait to go back when I can get something fancy!  I later painted an OPI holo top coat over this pink and it's so subdued and pretty.  I will  definitely go back and they gave me a rate so reasonable I'm ecstatic!  PS: The photo included is the old photo, the salon has been redone and looks fine.

A friend of a friend recommended Lou/Autoplex and I couldn't be happier.  Lou provides honest, fast service and is a pleasure to deal with.  No runaround, no nonsense, honest auto service.  Extremely difficult to find these days... I went to him for a muffler/tailpipe and then later for a catalytic converter and was completely happy with the outcome.  Additionally, he pointed out other things that I should see my previous mechanic about that they needed to fix/finish.  :)

Loved this outing!  It was the Dr. Sky dinner cruise and the food was DELICIOUS and drinks were inexpensive.  Dr. Sky was great, showed us amazing stuff and even got out the telescope on shore afterwards and talked with us as long as anyone had questions..  Great guy, wonderful cruise staff, I highly suggest!  Definitely will go back!

I read the best and the worst reviews here on Yelp before venturing out to see a friend's band play.  Thank God that was the reason for the trip and not to get good service.    Upon entering (not as dark as they say) we were greeted with a $5 cover charge, which we expected.  The gentleman told us to find a spot at the bar.  There were clearly (as could be seen upon entering) no spots at the bar, and it was about two deep at that juncture (later on it became three deep).  No one asked if we were there to dine.  So... they made that decision for us.  The only free spot had a reserved sign on it.  Though the decor is gorgeous and fun and comfy, that's where it ends.  Always always always a line for the two onesie unisex restrooms.  Having to put the lid down for a total stranger is just yunk.  I understand their logic, just .. eesh.    It was HOT.  I had to stand the entire time, which was not such a big deal but... it's like standing on the outskirts of a seated room.. a bit awkward (thank heavens for the "dim lighting").    At no time did anyone ever ask if we'd like to have a drink or be seated.  Every time a table opened up, a busser quickly came over and placed a reserved sign on the table.  I suppose I could have gone back to the doorperson and requested to get on a list but... at this point I didn't want to drop a dime here.  There was no getting to the bar for a drink, however, a TIP for those who are there to see the band and can afford to leave for 10 minutes at a time every hour or so.    Exit Kazimierz, make a left... soon you'll see lights on a building on the corner... head that way.  There is a beacon of hope called Bungalow Bar and Grill... there's a back entrance to the outdoor patio via gate.  A cold beer is quick to come by.  Unfortunately, once I arrived there I couldn't bring myself to head back to Kazimierz.  PS:  Clientele is as pretentious as they say.  Everyone who attends thinks they are pretty and special and elite.  It's actually kind of humorous albeit a bit sad.

Well, I am not a foodie.  I am a super pickie super taster (that's a thing, look it up on Wikipedia).  I don't care for many foods.  I don't like meat on the bone, I don't like fish, I don't like spicy foods, and the list goes on... .I also am not a lover of a many places.  Additionally, service is KING and I will frequent a place that has fair fare just because service is phenom.    In Miele's, I hit the JACKPOT.    Let me start with my personal favorite: the bread loaf.  Now I had this type of bread only once before in my life... at Tony's Pizza on 59th and Olive and he would not sell me a loaf by itself, the most he would do is sell me the "pizza bread" with no sauce or cheese.  Come on, Tony.  Help a loaf-lover out.  So the loaf.. and they have them to go.  And I love them for it.  Get one.  Get five.  They're wondrous.  The ONLY suggestion I have here would be an Italian Mix of herbs on the table if you want for your oil and vinegar dip.  Small preference, might be just me.  Next: I had the calzone my first trip, with a mix of rich cheeses.  So melt-in-my mouth delish... just perfectly cooked.  The servers were so friendly, anticipating my empty beverages.  Our cups runneth over.  It was a relaxing, enjoyable experience.  That was first trip.  I don't remember what my fiance got, but he was thrilled.  That was our first trip, and we used a Restaurant.com coupon.  Second trip we got a little smarter.  Since this is a smallish place (hence the name: bistro) we went a bit after the dinner hour.  The weather permitted, so we picked a spot on the patio and settled in and ordered the Sicilian pizza.  I know from experience (Raffaele's has been a fave since high school) that they take a good hour to cook).  We enjoyed the garlic knots as an appetizer.  They were good but if you're expecting a serving size like that at NYPD you're only going to get about a half dozen - although they are tastier than NYPD.  I preferred the mozzarella sticks that we had previous.  Nom.   We ordered our Sicilian with the white pizza toppings and salami on half.  It was really good although a bit overdone.  They mentioned that they had a new pizza oven and were dialing in on the done-ness of it.  I think they'll get it perfect next time.  I actually prefer the sauce to my other Sicilian fave (mentioned above) which is a bit too sweet for me.  Some will disagree.  NOW... the icing on this cake... is the CHEESECAKE.  Can we talk????  I had THE BEST... and I mean THE BEST piece of cheese cake ever in my whole entire life of all times here.  It was so rich and just the right amount of sour and the consistency was so delicious ... I just inhaled it.  I had my fiance go back the next day and pick me up a piece to go.  They'll do it up with choco and nuts and a drizzle but I prefer mine plain.  OMG I think about it every day now.  My mouth is literally watering thinking about it.    So to top all of that off, we were really scared what it would cost, after all, the first time we used a coupon, and now we were paying full price.  These prices are SO REASONABLE that you can't NOT go there.  It's such fantastic service, they are so friendly and attentive, it's such a fantastic experience and the food is amazing.  You have to go.  They have us as long as they'll have us.

Went to the bar at Black Angus to have some drinks and pubbish food for my birthday.  (remember when it was called Square Cow Fun Bar and there was all you can eat buffet?  Me neither - but my mother does).  Got three apps, six adult beverages for $30 - superfast service - also brought the warm bread (even though we didn't end up eating entrees).  Nice ambiance, squeaky clean, good prices and decent apps.  Will definitely be back! :)

I was so excited when my mother told me about Two Sparks, having done quite a few things in her home, I was thrilled to have a referral from someone tried and true.   I excitedly called (on a Sunday) and left a message explaining what we needed: a light fixture in bathroom replaced with a single gang (?) power outlet, GFCI if possible (this home is old so there are no GFCI outlets at present).  I did not expect a return call until the next business day.  I gave my boyfriend's number since I work late most eves.    Bright and early Monday morning, my boyfriend received a call from Michelle to set up an appointment for Thursday at 4PM.  He works in Queen Creek until 3PM so rushed home to make the appointment only to find....  NO CALL.  NO SHOW.  At 5:30PM I called home to ask how it went.  My boyfriend explained that no one had come by or called, but he was giving benefit of the doubt with traffic, etc.  I then called them to see if he should continue waiting or reschedule and left my number and my bf's number (again - maybe they lost it?)    NO RESPONSE.  My boyfriend then called (thought perhaps that number would be more recognizable since he's been called by them Monday).    NOTHING.  It is now four days later and we've never been contacted.  While I hope nothing serious happened to them (accidents do happen, and that I understand) I find it unacceptable to have made an appointment that was not kept, and then never followed up with any apology or follow up.  It's simply not how business should be done.    While I'm sure their business won't suffer from this negative review, be prepared for a possible no call no show.    JUSSAY'N.

So 10 days after this review posted, Michelle called and let me know that there was a problem with their phone system and let me know that if we still needed the work done (we do) to give her a call.  She was very cordial.  I am so glad that she followed up and that no big tragedy happened!

UPDATE:  Got a referral from another company to call these gals and thought I'd try again - happy to have been called back right away.  Although we'd already scheduled something with someone else, I am so glad their phone system is back on track and all's well!

Holly is a real professional who aims to please, inherently understands what cut, color, and style I want to walk away with, and helps me to continue to realize and define my look over time.  Fantastic products, great location, and fun one-of-a-kind gift shop items, this award winning salon provides top quality service that will keep me coming back year after year.

If ya'll don't keep this place nice and busy and it shuts down, I'm going to go ballistic.  With service as sweet as can be and hefty portions of what I call "down home goodness" it doesn't get much better than this.  It's what you'd make at home but don't because it takes too long, because you're cooking for one, because it's almost cheaper to eat here - I can't say enough good things about it.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  If I lived closer I'd be in big trouble.

A clean neighborhood bar/grill with live music and a decent happy hour.  I have had nothing but excellent bar food here.    Love the outdoor patio when the weather permits.  Wish more original bands would play here.  I can hear cover bands across the street!  **Addendum** grabbed some 99 cent Tacos on a Tuesday and they were OH SO YUMMY!  WIN!

I can't believe I haven't rated this before.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here.  Kool-aid on tap!   NOM!    I do have to say that I don't eat wings, but my bf does EVERYWHERE and this is one of his faves.  His 7 year old said they have the best food she's had anywhere!  She is a picky little princess too!  I get to nosh on all of the other deliciousness they offer... try them all!    We will be back again and again and again!

Why this place wasn't more busy I have no clue but I'm writing a good review in hopes it will stick around!    FRESH... really fresh... I could taste how fresh the beef was and the fries are hand cut and made daily.  Delish!  Margaritas - nom - $2 on Thursdays!    Love the stuffed burgers and multiple (rich gooey) cheese selections, I had a Havarti cheeseburger while my boyfriend mixed up a stuffed burger Voodoo style (blackened,  with bleu cheese and bacon in there somewhere).  If you want greasy bar grub, visit the Reef in the same plaza.  If you're seeking delicious, decadent casual food, this is your place.    We will definitely visit again and again... make sure you sign up to receive the weekly specials via text!   SECOND VISIT:  $1 Margaritas and $1 Pina Coladas!  On a SATURDAY!!! Heaven!  This time we tried the pretzel (omg I want to take one home and put a hot dog on it!) and the wings.  My boyfriend enjoyed the wings and he is picky.  He got this hot this time, and they were HOT - he said next time he'll try the honey hot -- which btw, is what the waitress suggested ;)   We ordered a pizza and my boyfriend could not stop raving about the pepperoni.  They use all Boar's Heads meats so that could explain it but we agreed that next time we are going to have to order sammies (mmmm!)  I also want to try the calzones!    I didn't mention the first time but the STAFF here is soooo sweet and attentive!  The owner came by to see how we were doing and was so kind I just really get the very best vibe out of this place.  I hear there are plans for a TV before football season so hurray!  Not a place that's loud and crazy and drunk but a casual atmosphere that's safe and clean and definitely worth the stop.    Going again this week to have a vegan friend try it! :D

From start to finish this company was as good as it gets.  I could name a few who dropped the ball on even getting me a quote and actually will probably circle back and do just that -- leave a review on their pages to show that they never even showed up or got back to me with a quote.  Mike, the owner of this company was in touch with me the day I first sent an email inquiry, even though it was a holiday and he was sick.   He provided me with an estimate based on my scale drawing.  He was out to give me a hard estimate within two weeks (when we decided it was within our budget) and was right on the money when it came to approximately how far out he was on the books with getting the install scheduled.    When it was time to install, he let me know about a week ahead of time that we'd be having the pavers installed.  I am so thrilled - the photos look just like those posted here already.  I am posting mine too, I put a watermark on mine because I think it looks so nice that some other company would want to use the photo themselves!  I am so thrilled with the professionalism, and would suggest this company to anyone.    The estimate was exact, cost me just what he quoted per foot (granted, my scale drawing was PERFECT) and his crew was hard working and had the job done in one day.  700 square foot winding deck is to die for and I'm just so happy.  Thank you MIKE DISTRUD and Pavers and More!  PS: His business cards are really cool.  SUPER STURDY!
