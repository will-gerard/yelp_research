It's great to be at a place where everyone knows your name!  Service here is unparalleled!  My first trip to Magnums was going to be to just stop in and just get a beer. I was going to check it out, if it was cool, I would go back again sometime for a cigar and maybe a scotch.  Walking into the bar, I felt like a kid walking into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory! Dimly lit, mixed crowd, the fantastic smell of cigars, and a Pink Floyd concert playing on one of their TVs...this was fantastic.  I stayed the entire night, getting myself a nice cigar from their impressive walk in humidor, amazed by their extensive selections of scotch, tequila, and beers.  Needless to say, I have been back to Magnums countless times since.   The staff is extremely knowledgeable on everything they sell, and can easily recommend a cigar to go with your drink or vise versa.  Great music is played throughout the bar/lounge and they even put in a space for live music (I haven't been there during a live show just yet).  Magnums can be pricey, but you can also get away with staying on the frugal side as well.  The drinks are very strong, and the selections are endless, so it is worth every penny no matter what the tab!  This place never disappoints, I wish I could give it 6 stars! It is a great place to grab a drink with friends, and a perfect way to end a classy night out.

We came in for lunch on a Saturday and sat at the outside bar. We were greeted by the bartender shortly after sitting down, and he took our drink order. He brought us back some menus and our drinks very quickly, and said he would give us a couple minutes to decide what to eat. He then disappeared on us, although other people at the inside bar were still being served. We pretty much finished our drinks with no one to take a food order or to check on us. We took this as a bad sign for the service we would be receiving, and just had our 2 drinks before leaving for food elsewhere.

When it comes to Chicago hot dogs or Italian beefs, you cant get better than Portillos!   Sure there are places around the valley to go get a Chicago dog or beef, but Portillos has them all beat hands down.  I got the Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers on top, my wife had their hot dog, and we both had their crinkle fries.  This food was so freakin good, it's like we were back in the windy city.  We went on opening day, and the line was out the door, and wrapped though the parking lot.  This didn't phase us, as the food is well worth the wait.  I cant estimate how many people were standing in line, but it took us about 1.5 hours to get our food.  The staff at Portillos were on top of it though! Tables were being cleaned as fast as they were being filled, cooks were sending out food as fast as possible, and all employees had very positive attitudes.  Bottom line: Awesome food & great service! I cant wait to go back!
