How much do I love this place? I have given myself a weekly allowance on what I can spend here. It is a practice in self control. I can't help myself when I come here. The selection is THAT awesome.   You know when you go to a record store and you see an album by an artist and it's not the one you want? When this happens, go to Tracks in Wax because the one you want will be there. No kidding. I get giddy on a freakish level.   What I really dig is the variety. They have major albums by popular rock bands, singles you've never seen and their alternative/punk selection is pretty awesome. It is super organized in there and they have the friendliest people working there.   Sad admission, due to the self imposed spending limit I keep a mental list of all the records I want to go back and pick up. It's a long list. By the way, the spending limit has nothing to do with the prices, which are awesome. It has everything to do with the fact that this place could turn me into a hoarder.

Add me to the Maria fan club. Seriously, I love that chick. Hand to God, if I ever had to fight in a trench, in a war, the first person I would want on my team would be Maria. She's a doll but she might kick your ass. "For sure!"  We started with the spaghetti calzone. Yeah, you heard me. They take spaghetti and they stuff it in a calzone. In. A. Cal. Zone. It reminded me of when I was a kind and we would make spaghetti sandwiches. No, I'm not kidding about that. It was delicious and I have dreams about it. They have those really thin metal forks that only pizza places have and mine kept bending the dough was so nice and thick and good.   The sauce for the pizza and the calzone is a happy thing. Tangy but sweet, as well. I could eat with we a well bent spoon. The pizza was good but we only got a small due to the calzone. Next time, I want to go with more people and get a bigger one so I can love on the cheese and toppings.  Lastly, the sodas come with that really awesome crushed ice that looks like jagged little pellets. To me, that's a clear sign you're in a good pizza joint.

We ate here once before but I'm a slacker that didn't review until visit number two. But, I am happy to say visit two was just as wonderful as number one.  I came here for one main reason: the first time I came I saw a group of three European dudes enjoying their lunch like it was their last and I covent my neighbors steak frites. So, yesterday I made reservations at 1:30 for a late lunch.   When you order they bring you a baguette for crusty French bread. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It was chilly outside and this was a real treat. We started with some wine. I had the house Merlot which was surprisingly nice for a $8 a glass house wine. Hubby wanted a sauv blanc and the waitress brought two bottles out and had him try each to see which one he liked better. THAT, my friends, is service.   Hubby claimed not to be that hungry and ordered one of the specials: French grilled cheese with frites. Now, this seems simple but it had double cream Brie, arugula, avocado and bacon. It was stupid. Crunchy, ooey, gooey, and rich as hell.   I got the Steak Roquefort. I felt more than gluttonous when I saw the couple next to me share my lunch. Yeah, I can eat. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that my steak was a little colder than I would like. Granted I ordered it medium rare but it seemed a little room temp like it sat there waiting for my husband's lunch. The frites were totally different. Think wonton chip like potato strips. I really really wanted a side of blue cheese sauce to dip them in. I was too afraid to ask for it as I thought that may move me from glutton to heathen.   All in all, a loaf of bread, three glasses of wine and two entrees,one of which involved steak came to $73 and the service was impeccable. Not kidding, I loved this girl. We have no idea what her name was but she was Asian and had cute glasses. She was charming.   I cannot wait to go back. I want to try everything on the menu. Twice. And not in one sitting, though I thought about it.

Stinkweeds, my love of you has lasted decades. You had me at "autographed copy of 10,000 Maniacs' In My Tribe" back in 1992. Regardless of the fact that nearly everyone in the store when I go is younger than that record, I still love you.   Santa missed one thing on my Christmas list - Foo Fighters' Sonic Highways on vinyl. I know I could order this online from Amazon for $21.36 including shipping. I looked. But, I think buying vinyl online lacks soul. Stinkweeds has soul.  Here's how shopping at Stinkweeds goes: Walk slowly through the records. See the name of an artist. Hold your breath. Lunge at the records. Flip furiously. Find Sonic Highways with the New York City cover. Gasp. Cheaper than Amazon. Gasp again. Embarrass husband by shouting across the small store.   Of course, sometimes the above scene ends differently where the artist tab is there and nothing by that artist. Then you hear a slow sad trombone noise in your head. But, it makes you want to come back every week just to see if, by any chance in heaven, there should one day be a record in that slot.   They have a great slection of rare albums, interesting bands to discover and always something playing that makes you have to ask the person at the counter who it is. Nice people, solid prices, great selection, even been vibe.

Why two stars? In a nutshell, it's not Harkins.   Hubs and I decided to take in a movie and this one had a time that fit our schedule. So, regardless of the fact that we have the Harkins Cup and everything we go to AMC. We had gone to dinner but just had a few light items because I am a sucker for theatre popcorn.   The theatre is not bad. Good and comfy seats. Small theatres but that's fine as the movie we saw was new and even on a Friday and 20 minutes before showtime, we're able to get a good seat.   The biggest disappointment? The two stars? The popcorn is horrific. Like crime against humanity bad. NO flavor and they don't scoop it into the bag when you order it. They hand you some pre-bagged popcorn shaped cardboard. I was sad the whole way through the movie. I  never realized I am a popcorn snob.

Dear Wolfgang,   I will dream of the truffle chips with blue cheese until my next return where I plan on dropping my suitcase whenever I shall be staying and beeline for your restaurant some can have them.   The mussels we unbelievable and I now feel challenged to try and master the fine art of cooking them so I can try to relive my dinner.   I would give you five stars much you wine list kind of made me said in terms of variety and price. Did not stop me from enjoying two glasses of red wine.   Save a seat for me.

I never thought it would happen. Guy Fieri betrayed my love and did me wrong. My heart is heavy. **cue woeful harminica**  Hubby, daughter and I embarked upon Piazza al Forno after watching triple D and seeing the menu online. We got there and were seated next to a large group that was incredibly loud. So not the restaurant's fault they were obnoxious. But, the waitress would talk to us in her "inside voice" which made her sound like Charlie Brown's teacher. Project, woman. Project!  The service was just so lacking. If you are clairvoyant, this is a good place for you. Those of us less gifted need not attend. She asked us if we were ready to order several times and saw we were clearly struggling to decide. Never offered menu info or a run down of specials. She didn't even offer a wine list! This week has sucked, so imagine my horror upon thinking this place was dry as no one ever alluded we could have a glass of wine or presented a list! Mama needed some wine. Help a sister out.   Our food came and we got the fried ravioli, baked spaghetti and the Italian Stallion. Nothing was even remotely worth writing home about. The baked spaghetti gave me the sense that they made a whole mess of spaghetti early in the day and threw it in the overn to heat it up when needed. Viola! Baked spaghetti!  When we appeared done she just brought us our check. Apparently, my brain waves caught on with their psychic vibe and told her we wanted to get out of dodge.  She never even asked us about dessert or brought back a menu. So, we went to Gelato Spot and I had triamisu flavored gelato. Done.   Wanted to love this place but it was so lackluster. So many places in the valley are better.

Hubby and I decided to head out for a Saturday bait date. We're relatively new to the whole sushi thing as both of us swore for years we didn't like it only to find out we love it.   First, any place that has a Saturday night happy hour is A-OK with me. Squid Ink's is 3-7 and 10pm to midnight. Every day. And the deals are pretty good. We were starving so we ordered a few apps and spicy yellow tail rolls which were all half off and I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and Hubby had a domestic beer. We were still a little hungry so we got and order of Hory Fook Rolls.  The food was excellent. The crab rangoons had HUGE pieces of crabs in them. Huge chunks and the chili gastrique (what does that even mean?) was yummy. The yellowtail melted in my mouth and the Hory Fook was spicy happiness.   As for service, we were a little hesitant as it took a whilr for us to first be served. But, once our waitress, Crystal, came by she was spot on. She came by at all the right times. Always right when we needed something and not so often that it killed conversation. She was excellent.   All in all our dinner was just under $40 including two drinks each. Nice.

I rarely give five stars but I can honestly say I would like to take the fra diavolo sauce and smear it on my face like some Italian war paint. That sounds totally weird but it's that good.  We've been here twice and the meatball sliders are to die for. Soft, flavorful and a whole side of that fra diavolo sauce. Can I go back to the sauce? I ate the remaining sauce that we got on the side as if it were soup. It is so fresh. I could literally taste the fresh chopped parsley. Perfect consistency, too.  We also got the eggplant rollatini. The crust is so flavorful and the eggplant was cooked nicely and just thin enough. We split a bottle of the Hey Mambo wine which was half off and so just $14. Our whole dinner came to 35 bucks including tax and tip. We may do this every Monday just because it's too good not too.   Yes, the service is slow but they make everything fresh and it's worth it. One lady got so mad and left becuase it had been a half hour and she still had no food. If you want great food and good ambiance, come here. If you want a meal in less than 14 minutes, go to freakin' Applebees. Have a bottle of wine and relax. Trust me.   The only way it could be better would be if it were a little bigger and had a couch that I could take a nap on in between courses. Pretty please, could you get that?

The boyfriend and I headed over there after being alerted by a DJ we like that he would be DJing for Sunday Brunch and they had bottomless bubbles for $10 during brunch. Sign me up!  We arrived around 11:30 after having to wander Scottsdale Quarter for some time trying to find the place. It was already freakin' hot outside and this place is like an icebox. I usually hate that but it was perfect. The first thing we noticed was the really cool decor. Very elegant and posh.  The second thing we noticed was that there was no one there. There were two other couples beside ourselves. I was really surprised. I could not find any reason why people would not want to jump on this. We were immediately welcomed by our server Charlie, who is a doll and we adored her. I asked which bubbles were included and she said that they have a wide selection but they try to work through what they have open. I get that. I'm sure if there was something I wanted that was not open they would have accommodated that but I was thrilled that they had a Schramsburg Blanc de Blanc. At $9 a glass on the menu, having this for the $10 bottomless bubbles is awesome.  We each ordered eggs benedict (short rib for me and tenderloin for the bf). Both were really good, perfectly prepared, came with the best potatoes ever and were a good deal at $12 each. It was just the right amount of food, too.  The only complaint that I had was how dead it was. They really need to step up their marketing for this. Next time I think I'll head there with a girlfriend or two that enjoys champagne. Boyfriend is not a fan and the drinks we're small and steep at $8 each. Of course, I drank more than our money's worth in champagne so it's all good! I hope they do this into the fall when it cools down a little bit!

I'm lazy. I'm lazy and I like wine. What I really like is to be lazy on patios that I don't have to clean up while I drink wine. Therefore, I have found a new happy place.   Ironically, we didn't sit on the outside patio as we had my daughter with us and the patio is 21 and over. I was bummed out but am sure the euphoria that will be induced by lounging with wine sans kids anywhere near me at a future time will make it all better.   Our waitress was adorable and explained that she can take our order with her iPhone and that, no, she wasn't texting. Cool technology, people. We ordered the fried mozzarella after she explained it wasn't like lame fried pieces of string cheese. Oh, she steered us down a happy path. The mozzarella is fresh house made and it was wrapped in thin pizza dough and fried. If I could married it, I would have. The marinara dipping sauce was spicy and tasty. My kid hogged all the cheesy goodness. Damn her.   Next, the three of us shared the small fettuccine with meat sauce with a few meatballs thrown in for good measure. Didn't feel like pizza but that looked REALLY good. The pasta was a little over cooked. More mushy than al dente. That's why they only get four stars. The sauce was yummy and the meatballs were freaking awesome. They had great flavor and held together really well. Personally, I would have dunked them in sauce and then served them. Just serving them baked, no sauce, made them seem dry.   Boyfriend and I had a glass of Pinot each and the bill came to $40, and we had a $10 off coupon. Pretty sweet. Perfect amount of food. We'll definitely be back. The staff is lovely and so is the atmosphere. Looking forward to some unpretentious wine patio lounging.

I just became horrified at my lack of review writing for LLL. Where have I been? How could I have disrespected triple L by not sharing the love? I feel shame. In a nut shell: I love this place, these are my people.   We started going during football season. This is the perfect place to watch football. An unlikely statement but hang in there for this. First, it's not horrifically crowded. Enough people there to make it fun. Everyone seems to end up chatting with everyone else. Second, all day happy hour on Sunday. All day. They have some damn good beer. Preferring wine, $3 glasses of house wine make me overjoyed! Third, they have food specials, too. Let's discuss.  My husband does not like pickles. I order the fried pickles every time. Then I eat the whole thing myself. Fat and happy. The sweet chili wings are to die for. The zucchini fries? Oh, Linger Longer, you got my husband to eat his veggies. Okay, you fried them first but still... The loaded fries are ridiculous but needs to be shared by a large group of people. Two of us can't finish them.   The staff makes this place. I love them. Ryan, the manager is just an all around good dude and great to chat with. He lets me pick on him because I have t-shirts older than him. He makes a mean cocktail, that guy! The rest of the team is equally nice. We went in one day and they were just testing out some new cocktails and lets us have a sip or two and asked our input. Bar consensus building! Yes ma'am!  We're there a few times a month because we just love it so much. I'm not kidding, we go for happy hour during the week and I get that same sigh of relief walking in as I do walking into my own house. Only, it's cleaner there....

Sometimes you need to wash Christmas down with a margarita. Yesterday, I did just that. Both finding ourselves with the day off and nothing to do but mill around downtown, the hubs and I stopped in late afternoon for a little happy hour, which they have daily (sweet bonus!)   We sat at the bar because we're those kind of people and the TV behind the bar was playing National Lampoon's Vacation... The house marg was way tasty. They are served in a short glass, which is good because they go down eaaaaasy. We had chips and salsa and that salsa is spicy and perfect. Amazing. We weren't exceptionally hungry but ordered some flautas. If these little gems are any indication of the level of tastiness of all the items on the menu, I may move in. Literally, like bring a label maker over there and declare a bar stool mine.   We chatted with Kevin who was working behind the bar. Cool dude. Great 'stache. Here's where they made us want to be regulars: Kevin introduced himself and asked our names and then called us by our names to see if we needed another cocktail. I love that kind of service. He gave us some great info about the menu and happenings, too.  They have events and live music certain days and what looks to be a great brunch on the weekends. The outdoor patio looks nice (it was a bit chilly yesterday) and is dog friendly which is another bonus. You can bet we'll be back and bring a huge appetite!

Holy rice balls! Hubs and I stopped in at the tail end of the Urban Wine Walk. We had always wanted to try this place so me figured we'd make it our last stop as we may want to linger. Oh, linger we did! I tried the Chardonnay they had for the wine walk, which was nice. But, I quickly became very distracted by the plates being shared by two ladies sitting next to me.   We were happy to find that we were there during "social hour." Hot damn! Bring me a menu! They have small plates on special from 3pm to 6pm every day. I am an afternoon patio drinker, not a Saturday night, leave the house at 10pm drinker. So, a saturday afternoon happy hour is awesome.  They also had glasses of wine for $5. I had the rose. So refreshing! Exactly what I needed on our first over 100 day. Hubs had the Dos Cabezas Red Blend. Nice size pours, too. We ordered the dirty rice balls and the cup of gumbo. Total cost of the small plates was $9 during social hour and it fed both of us! The rice balls had a relish that went with them that was cool and crisp. Perfect to go with that warm gooey rice ball. The gumbo had a massive amount of smoked chicken in it with a huge scoop of rice on top. I'm not kidding, it was just as good, if not better, that the gumbo I had in New Orleans.   We sat at the bar and all of the bartenders were just nice as could be. One even ran our wine walk glasses through the dishwasher for us. That was just the nicest gesture. They also have a good amount of misters going on the patio so it did not seem like it was 101 degrees. They had a sangria that everyone was trying for the wine walk that I can't wait to try out on that patio. Lots of other tasty libations as well. We will definitely be back!
