It's a good thing I don't work in Central Phoenix - I would stop by Pane Bianco WAY too often. This tiny sandwich shop is like nothing I've experienced before in Phoenix. They specialize in a very limited menu of artisanal sandwiches, served on house-made bread, as well as a few salads. I've had all of the sandwiches and have narrowed the top two down to the soppressata and the tuna.  The soppressata is like an Italian sandwich on gourmet steroids. The roasted red peppers bring out the rich flavors of the Italian meats and provide the perfect acidic balance to the fattier density of the meats and cheese. A perfect foil to the soppressata, the tuna is light and delicate with a strong lemon flavor - this isn't you mom's canned tuna and Miracle Whip on white bread. The tuna, made with red onion, lemon and olives, is topped with wild arugula, which provides a bitter bite and counters the fishiness. My suggestion - go with a friend and order one of each. The sandwiches are large, and I love to order one tuna and one soppressata and split half-and-half.   I've heard nothing but great reviews for the salads, too, but I confess that I'm never in the mood the healthy salad alternative when I can smell freshly baked bread and know that a fabulous Pane Bianco sandwich creation is in my immediate future.

If you're never been to the Rokerij in North Central Phoenix, you're missing out. The tiny restaurant is housed in, literally, a cool old stone house. I hadn't been for a year or so and ventured over last weekend to visit their bar, which, it should be noted, is actually underneath the restaurant (read: basement bar; yes, I know finding a basement in Arizona is rare). The atmosphere couldn't be more charming - picture dark and cozy, a long bar, several couches, and a crackling fireplace with leather armchairs.   Now to the best part - half off wine bottles on Sundays. For all of you wine lovers out there, you know that scoring a bottle for half price is a treat. To make things even better, there wasn't a bottle on the basic wine list over $50, meaning that you can buy a great bottle for less than the cost of a cheap pair of heels. Let's consider the options here - a pair of cheap shoes that will inevitably hurt and be worn twice, or a bottle of wine? Clearly the wine is the best choice. It should also be noted that the half off applies to the reserve wine list, another unusual perk of this hidden treasure.  The fabulous wine discounts are made even better by the Rokerij's $5 small plates. These are slightly larger than standard tapas, and you'll find everything from sweet and sour short ribs and bacon wrapped scallops to my favorite, king crab tostada bites. Order a few to share - you're sure to find something on their rather extensive menu of choices.   The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, making a few recommendations and chatting as appropriate, but not excessively. This is truly a great local hang out. I made a note to myself, upon leaving, that I needed to head back sooner rather than later. I've been thinking about it all week, so perhaps another Sunday evening Rokerij adventure is on the horizon!

If you are a seafood lover, you simply must try Wildfish in Scottsdale. I was an Eddie V's fan before discovering Wildfish (still a fan), and I was thrilled to find another Arizona seafood restaurant that gets it right.   I'll cut right to the best part - the Hong Kong style sea bass cannot be missed. I have dreams about this meal, it's that amazing. First, the fish is gorgeous. I've never seen a piece of fish so white and beautiful, I gasped when I lifted off the Asian-style plate cover and found such a sight. Next, the sea bass rests in a savory pool of soy and sherry broth that so perfectly compliments the fish's delicate and juicy texture that it seems almost too good to be true. I had this the first time on new years eve 2009. When I'm at Wildfish for dinner now, it's the only thing I order. Everything else is, of course, delicious, but the Hong Kong sea bass just can't be topped.  If you're stopping by Wildfish for lighter fare, make sure you're there during happy hour. I would venture to say that Wildfish has one of the best happy hours in the city, based on drink prices and food price and quality. Here are a few gems from the appetizer menu (I've tried them all):  - Chilled avocado and crab cocktail - Spicy shrimp and crab potstickers (another amazing broth moment) - Wildfish chopped salad  Order a few apps to share at happy hour and you're sure to have a great experience! If you're in the mood for something sweet to drink, give the blood orange margarita a shot!

I really, really wanted to love Bacon...but...it just wasn't the whole hog for me.  First of all, you can't fault the d√©cor. The interior is fresh and fun, and thankfully it lacks the typical grandma's-kitchen-circa-1955 look that so many breakfast joints seem to love. The look is clean and modern, with a farmhouse edge that works perfectly. 4 stars for ambiance.  The service, unfortunately, wasn't quite so fresh and fun. Here's where the disappointment starts. I had to ask for a cup of coffee three times - there were only a few tables when I was there, so no excuse for not remembering. The third time, the server told me that he had told his bus boy to get it already, but that he would go ahead and make the coffee for us...thanks, I think? One of my biggest pet peeves with customer service is making an excuse when something doesn't go correctly. If the guy had just said that he had spaced out, I wouldn't be writing this at all. Don't blame your bus boy because you're too busy flirting with the hostess to pour a cup of coffee.   Next, the food. It's just okay. Off the bat, I felt that the menu was pretty limited. Presenting guests with a smorgasbord of options isn't necessary, but Bacon's menu is short and stingy, in my view. I ordered the yogi omelette, which includes egg whites, mushrooms and broccoli. I wasn't expecting much out of a cheese-free option, so no complaints about my own food. The veggies were fresh and I actually liked the cottage cheese and salsa side dish. My friend ordered the BLT and it was fine but, again, nothing to write home about. The potatoes that were served with the BLT were SUPER salty and tasted like they were coated in butter. I love butter and salt, but this was over the top. The meal was okay at best, nothing extraordinary.   I was left wanting more, and wishing that we had just gone to a reliable standby, rather than venturing out of our way to Bacon.

Glad to see that all of the reviews for Over Easy aren't stellar, as I've been consistently underwhelmed by this Camelback corridor breakfast joint. At the base level, there just isn't anything exciting about the food. I could make it at home, so why go out of the way to pay for something that I could find at any random greasy spoon? I know that a lot of the Arcadia set love Over Easy, but it simply strikes me as an okay-at-best, retro-trendy hole in the wall. Also, and certainly worth mentioning, the service was bad - unfriendly staff and I felt sort of like I should be grateful that I could grab a table, rather than feeling welcomed. Skip it - Over Easy is over-hyped and under-delivers.

This new North Scottsdale restaurant and live music venue has great potential, but will need a few minor adjustments and the support of locals to make it work.   First and perhaps most critical, I've repeatedly been impressed by their music lineup. The set up for a live venue works well - I saw Blind Boys of Alabama a few months ago and found that The Compound's high-tech bar and main restaurant area (which was transformed into concert seating that night) made for a cozy yet vibrant and open experience. I felt like I was in the closest section of any other major venue, when I was actually nearly in the back.   Not to be missed are local and house bands that frequent The Compound's stage. I've stopped by for a drink several times and have been surprised to find a great band that struck just the right mix of interesting without being overly loud or distracting.   I can't say I've tried much off of the food menu, though I really enjoyed the house quesadilla with chicken (I know, such a boring choice). I would recommend that they revamp their wine list slightly to offer a few more non-standard choices under $10 a glass. I'm not sure that their beverage menu is set up to appeal to the crowd they seem to be courting, as they have booked some favorites from the jam band scene, which can mean a lot of younger types who won't be willing to pay over $6 for a cocktail.   Overall, definitely worth stopping in and checking out. With a few tweaks and more time, this will be a choice spot on the local music scene.

Every time I go to Arcadia Farms, I like to engage in a little fantasy (totally G rated)...  ...I'm a lady who lunches, knows nothing about the challenges of the daily workplace grind, and has the time to sip mimosas for 3 hours each afternoon (the mimosa element is really part of a broader alcohol fantasy that I should get checked out)...also, you should know that I'm always wearing a gigantic, Kentucky-derby style hat in this scenario.   While the fantasy isn't likely to be my reality anytime soon, I love Arcadia Farms for having created a cozy and charming atmosphere that inspires just this sort of harmless day dreaming. The restaurant itself if small, which adds to the French country/shabby chic feel. The patio is beautiful and has a quaint garden feel. When you're there you'll immediately notice that the "ladies who lunch" fantasy is actually a reality for many of the patrons.  The food is lovely, which is exactly how food should be at this type of place. One of my favorites is the pesto shrimp salad, and the warm vegetable salad is a close second. If you're in the mood to splurge, order one of the mini cakes - you'll be glad you did. Arcadia Farms is as famous for fabulous pastries as it is for salads, sandwiches and tea.   When you're next at the Phoenix Art Museum, keep in mind that Arcadia Farms has another location there, though it is somewhat different. Similarly delish menu, but the atmosphere is much more streamlined and modern to fit the feel of the museum. While I love the original location the most, the museum location is a great treat when you're downtown.
