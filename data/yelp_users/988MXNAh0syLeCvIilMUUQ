From the moment you step into Dr. Krygier's office [The Root Canal Guy], every detail has been organized to make your root canal day an immensely positive and stress-free experience! When you walk-in, even as a new patient, you are greeted by name by a very upbeat staff member, smiling and welcoming.. Within minutes you are taken to a perfectly clean but comfortable room, your chart is already up on the very large and readable monitors, they have everything ready to go, like they have been thinking about you personally all day!! Dr. Krygier's skill is amazing and his  assistant's as well, perfectly in sync with each other, they explain each procedure step, ensuring that you are completely aware and at ease throughout the appointment. If you have had previous root canals, you have to experience The Root Canal Guy for yourself to understand just how good it can be. A perfect 10.

I RARELY write a review, but STAY AWAY from AZ STATE APPLIANCE unless you want to pay big markup prices for parts and charged for service time over and above the time they spent working on appliances. BAD BAD BAD!!!
