One of the best oxymoronic ethnic restaurants in Phoenix. They have some of the most authentic Japanese food but then they're offering Italian food on the same menu?? Don't try to figure this place out. Just go try it and you'll see that good eats, quality and value are all had here.

I fully agree with Bil Z. --- the food is a little overpriced and not worthy of 5 stars, but the concept of this restaurant / movie theater makes up for it many times over.  It's surprising there aren't more of these places around.  The food is on par with typical 4 star hotel (Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) restaurants both in terms of quality and price.  The decor is reminiscent of art deco style theaters.  Sound and projection quality doesn't compare to a large chain, but the intimate atmosphere makes up for it.  Here's a tip -- go to restaurant.com and you can usually find coupons for $25 off which can be purchased for $5-$10.  Enjoy!

It's been awhile since I thought a service business went above and beyond to warrant a Yelp review. Marty is a passionate business owner who takes great pride in his work. Our pool fence turned out to be perfect -- aesthetically pleasing, easy for adults to take on and off, and most importantly it's high quality and will protect our kids. We had a pool net installed about 5 years ago and finally decided it was time to actually use our pool. Thanks, Marty!

Cuban food is not very plentiful in Phoenix, but Havana Cafe does a very good job of making it accessible, tasty, and fun.  If you're not sure what Cuban food is, think of a Spanish and Mexican hybrid.  The seafood paella is delicious and a stand out, but everything I've tried on the menu is at least above average.  The food is always consistent and the staff and atmosphere usually have a friendly vibe.  Check it out!

Very mediocre --- tastes one notch above a frozen Tombstone pizza.  The pizza itself really only deserves 1 star, but their selection of toppings makes up for it.  There are other items on the menu that may be better, but since this is "Pizza" Picazzo, I'd expect better.  Rosati's is a much better option in the area.

Make the trek north as far as Scottsdale Rd. goes and reward your senses at el Pedregal.  The topography around here may make you feel like you're on Mars, and the compound that houses restaurants, shops, and a stage is reminiscent of Morocco.  It's definitely upscale and frequented by snowbirds in the winter, but it's still delightfully romantic and a must-see for all native Phoenicians.

Maharaja means "high king" in Hindi.  Those words absolutely describe how you'll feel after dinner at this mouth-watering Indian restaurant.      I like to consider myself a connoisseur of this historically and tastefully rich cuisine.  A month in India and many dozens of different naans, curries, and tandooris at restaurants around the world have left this palette with an ability to play restaurant critic.  Pick any dish on the menu (believe me... we've tried almost all) and your taste buds will be immersed in a culinary frenzy.  Standouts include the juiciest and tenderest Tandoori Chicken (for those who are newbies), the most creamy and decadent Chicken Tikka Masala (for those a little more daring), and delectable Karahi specialties.      You'll never have to wait for a table, which is a good thing except the owner is thinking about closing.  A bad location (strip mall in the middle of Glendale) and an unimaginative atmosphere don't quite give people the spark to make the trek over.  Knowing one can leave a "high king" should give you that extra push to give it a try and allow the reign to continue...

I was an optimist when the America West / US Airways merger news hit the airwaves.  Unfortunately I was a bit too hopeful.  I've traveled a lot for work (and pleasure) so it made sense to stay loyal to one airline and become "Gold Elite" to take advantage of the benefits, namely lots of first-class upgrades, no lines, bonus miles, etc.      A string of events (I won't bore you with the unethical and deceitful details) that took place last week on what was to be an easy non-stop flight from SFO to PHX cemented my negative feelings.  Since the merger took place prices have risen dramatically,  customer service has dropped substantially, and the sunny Arizona airline has been infiltrated with dreary East Coast attitudes.  The stock has tumbled and the outlook is not good.  Everything seemed to be on the up and up before there was any talk of a merger.      Strangely, America West bought out US Airways.  How did they let this demise transpire?  From now on it looks like Kayak.com will decide my airline and flights.

Hookahs are the draw here. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere quite blah. If smoking sheesha is your thing, there aren't many old town Scottsdale options so this may be your place. My bud ordered lamb tongue and was pretty happy with it. I didn't have the balls to try it, but if you do you may be in for a pleasant adventure.

If you truly appreciate the purity and Zen-line qualities of sushi, then you're in for the best upscale ethnic experience the Valley has to offer.    I'm by no means a foodie or culinary expert.  Take me to a fancy French restaurant and I'm lost.  Bring me to Sea Saw and everything just makes perfect sense.  One gets the impression that painstaking care went into each dish that comes out.  It's hard to take a bite that doesn't leave you pondering the reasoning that went into the ingredients chosen... the multi-layered sensory overload that comes from the layers of taste... the absolute artistic genius that brings the flavor together to create a near Japanese masterpiece.  This Old Town space is small so make sure to reserve at least a week or two in advance.  Be prepared to spend some money -- tasting w/ wine is $125 (yet very highly recommended!).  For the past 3 years the tasting has been my birthday dinner.  This year I'm headed to The French Laundry and until then (and maybe after), this restaurant ranks as my world favorite.

It's rare to find a trendy Scottsdale lounge that mixes good drinks, friendly staff, and a cool scene. Even though this isn't really my scene, every time I end up here I'm pleasantly surprised. The crowd is diverse --- Paris Hilton wannabes and shaggy fake blond Cali guys, fat guys and ugly women, laid back cool peeps, and of course the beautiful people. The bathroom setup is probably worth a trip if only to check it out. They don't seem to discriminate at the door, so all should feel comfortable despite the somewhat exclusive aura of the place.

This place proves that Southwestern cuisine is not dead and there's still room for lots of creativity.  Foodies and wine connoisseurs alike will enjoy just about everything on the menu.  Definitely order the chopped salad and let that begin the journey to an evening of culinary excellence.

Happy Hour might be a winner, but the regular dinner is a disappointment.  Our business meal started with the Maitre D' claiming quite arrogantly there was no reservation (it was confirmed the week prior).  After a 20 minute wait our party was disenchanted with spotty service, uninspired food, and ultimately a bill that was well beyond what the meal warranted.  You may not want to diss this place since others speak so highly of Happy Hour.  But when it comes to full priced dinners... go elsewhere.

Let's start with a couple redeeming qualities first... the entertainment, if you dine during it, creates a fun atmosphere and the energy in the place is high. We had a Spanish waiter who was attentive and quick.  On the other hand, the food leaves much to be desired. I lived in Seville, Spain for 6 months and have eaten at many Tapas restaurants in the states... so, I have enough experience with Spanish food to judge. The food here is uninspired, bland, and borderline gross. We kept ordering more (tortilla, caricoles, pepin salad, pimientos, empanada, salmon) hoping maybe we just made a bad choice. Nothing was even decent! This place has potential but the owner should seriously consider hiring a new chef and completely revamping the menu. I'll be back to try it if that happens, but I won't return nor will I recommend if everything is status quo.

French restaurants are supposed to be a little stuffy, and attitude is the name of the game.  But you usually get superb food and the unfriendly atmosphere just becomes part of the experience.      Not here my friend... the food is very mediocre and when you pay top dollar for it, something is definitely wrong.  I ordered the bouillabaisse (about $30) and was disgusted when several of the mussels were rancid.  The other fish and seafood in the dish tasted like they had been in the freezer too long.      I'd like to say it deserves a second chance, but rude staff and stale food at high prices don't mix well.  Consistency in the restaurant business means everything, and this place doesn't seem to have it.

VERY authentic Japanese in an elegant, clean, and inviting atmosphere. The sushi is always fresh and their exotic specials (ask chef as they're hidden from the general crowd) are excellent. Don't expect Americanized super rolls here. This is the real deal folks.

Think Pei-Wei with a twist.  This place wins the award for best "Thai Fast Food", but remember... it is Thai fast food.  Not worth a trip for ethnic foodies, but definitely a reasonable choice for locals or those curious about the Asian fast food niche sweeping the Valley.  The husband / wife owners are always pleasurable and the food is always good.  Go for any of the curries and your taste buds and your wallet will leave happy.

Some of the tastiest Persian food I've ever had and you will ever probably have in the valley.  Order the "kash-ke-badam-jon" (or something to that effect) for an appetizer and you'll be pretty close to ethnic food heaven.  Their kebab plates are divine... make sure to substitute the dill rice.  Another bonus is the homemade pita... delicious!  Only reason they don't get 5 stars is because of inconsistency --- been there about 10 times and probably half of those times there was spotty service or a minor food-related issue.  If they're on the night you go you're in for a real treat!

The best Ethiopian food in the Valley, and some of the best anywhere for that matter.  If you're a vegetarian you'll be in heaven, and if you're not... well, you'll still be in heaven.  The messob dinner is a best bet.  Also try the refreshing Ethiopian wine.

Old school French not at its best from a culinary standpoint but pretty darn good when all other things are considered. Be greeted by the 85+ year old proprietor and step back in time when you enter this eclectic restaurant surrounded by cowboy saloons and saguaros. The prices can't be beat... a prix fixe meal with soup, salad, entree, coffee, and dessert can be had for close to $20. I had the coq au vin and can say it was good but keep in mind this place is not Zinc Bistro style, but more Paris-esque circa 1945. If you like old style French it's worth a trip up to Cave Creek to check this diamond in the rough out.

To some this is a real AZ hangout.  To others it's nothing but an overpriced tourist trap with bad food.  There's a little bit of truth to both of those statements.  Bottom line... it's a decent place to take out-of-town guests to experience an old West atmosphere and eat fried chicken.  Order any other food at your own discretion!  Oh yeah, the beer is OK to drink as well.

I'd give it 5 stars but the oysters were bad... really bad. Ambiance is really cool in a retro way and the prime rib was superb. The staff is attentive and reminiscent of old school American steak restaurants from Chicago or NY. If you're looking to drop some dough on a good steak dinner with more character than Morton's or Fleming's, this is your place.

Massive Scottsdale scene - fake rich guys and plastic women.  Went here for a business meeting and we both ordered steaks which came out extremely rare and had to be sent back.  The waiter forgot other stuff and the food was mediocre at best considering the prices.  The restaurant is run very strangely ... bouncer type guys with ear piece walkie talkie things come around every 15 minutes to make sure everything is going OK ... but in a harassing way.  This place may be heaven for some, but if gaudy large scale club atmospheres with an annoying crowd ain't your thang... stay away.

This may be the best fast-food place in the valley. It's amazing that Chino Bandido has been around for almost 2 decades and it hasn't been franchised across the country. I guess the location has something to do with it... it's out of the way and just perfect to keep it somewhat of a secret.  Somehow their Mexican, Chinese, Caribbean, and other Asian choices all seem to blend together beautifully. Finish it off with a Snickerdoodle and you've had yourself one delicious, albeit not so healthy, meal.

They have a few different locations, all of which are very good.  I haven't gone wrong ordering anything on the menu.  Everything is fresh and very high quality.  Dinner can be expensive but the lunch specials are a steal.  Check out the coupons on restaurant.com if you want to save some $$$.

Probably the most comprehensive Chinese menu in the Valley.  Pick from well over 100 dishes, but if you want the best order the Peking Duck.  Everything else is very good, but without a wow factor.  You'll see lots of Chinese people in this massive restaurant, which probably means they're doing a fine job in the kitchen.

The only reason Capital Grille gets more than 1 star is because of atmosphere.  I've heard mixed reviews from others, so there is a chance you'll have a fine meal.  My birthday dinner here was totally unacceptable... and fortunately they credited almost the whole meal for 5 people.  The steaks were... no exaggeration... Sizzler quality.  Gritty, overcooked, blah--- ick!  To give them the benefit of the doubt, there was probably an inconsistency issue here.  Maybe they got a bad cow!  Whatever the case, for these prices and for them to maintain their chain reputation, this should have never happened.

I think IKEA is the coolest store in the world. They've pretty much conquered the globe and managed to bring much-needed style to the far reaches of the planet. Almost everyone can find something that fits their interior design objectives. Selection is incredible, staff is usually always helpful, and their Swedish restaurant and grocery store make the trip all the way out to the middle-of-nowhere worth it.

Combine one of the world's nicest physical eating establishments (both natural surroundings as well as the $10+ mil restaurant itself), arguably some of the best gourmet Italian food West of the Atlantic, and impeccable service and you have yourself a winner.  Prices aren't cheap but in my opinion it's a deal considering what this package offers.  Think I'm exaggerating?  Check it out and let the truth be told!

So simple... so authentic... just the type of place to make you feel like you're back in Germany --- that is, if you've ever been to Germany.  If you haven't, check this place out and you can pretty much save a trip over there.  It's hard to go wrong here.  The food is classic German --- sausages, kraut, schnitzels, etc.  Oh, and don't forget about the tall glasses of beer that you can drink in the beer garden!

This place is a mixed bag in terms of style, quality, and consistency.  We used to go for happy hour when it first opened and the sushi was worth every penny.  A few trips back for regular dinners over the past few months has left me pretty disappointed.  The atmosphere, especially in Cave Creek, somewhat makes up for what the food lacks.  But the prices are far above what one would expect for the quality one gets.  A dinner this week resulted in a $24 seared ahi entree being sent back twice (first time cooked all the way through and the second time just touched the grill for about 2 seconds)... they never did end up getting that right, along with a list of many other things the waiter and young staff just couldn't deliver on.  Consistency is key and Ten doesn't have it.  Gamble and you may end up with a decent dinner.

It's a small place and heading over here after a Friday night Suns game (which was also First Friday) left us with little room to enjoy... too many people in too cramped a space. It seems like it would be a pretty sweet hangout if not too crowded, otherwise the sardine can cliche really describes the atmosphere. The area seems to be gentrifying and with the light rail on the way more places like this will start popping up in the area. Good thing for those from back East who appreciate non-Disneylandesque type spots with vintage character.

Chinese buffets usually deserve 1 to 2 stars. This place almost deserves a full 5 but even with 4 it's definitely worth checking out. NOTE: You must go in understanding it's a buffet and not made-to-order and you should be blown away.  We went on a Sunday and for $11.99 you get unlimited sushi (freshly made in front of you), lots of different unique Chinese seafood dishes, and dozens of other Asian delights. It's at the Chinese Culture Center so you can hang out at the market after, which is a trip in and of itself.

Don't get me wrong ... Yasu is a great Japanese restaurant. But, 5 stars is being a little too generous. When all is said and done you get a very good Japanese meal at a relatively high price. Unlike your typical sushi place, Yasu offers some more off-the-beaten-path Japanese delicacies which are all worth a shot.

We are in the process of having a fence installed to replace the net. Although the idea is great and the net is more aesthetically pleasing than a fence, the reality is these things are just too cumbersome and difficult to get on and off.   First of all, nobody will service the pool unless we take the net off and put it back on. We have rarely used our pool (and have 2 kids) because of the inconvenience and time it takes to get on and off.   Overall, we were happy with the service and installation, but buyer beware: it's very difficult and time consuming to use and you won't be able to have your pool serviced unless you remove it.

The 2 stars are based solely on food. I admit I've never stepped foot into this place. A few sandwiches have been brought back to my office, each time not fulfilling my mid-day hunger attack. The main problem I have is the price. You basically get what seems to be a couple slices of souped-up Wonderbread with some Safeway-quality lunch meats then cooked with a George Foreman Grill. I think the prices are about $8 --- if they offer a 50% off special then go for it.

The first time I ate here it was a couple weeks after opening and the poor service and even worse food was going to be given another chance. That second chance many months after opening yielded the same ... probably the worst sushi I've ever had in my life and service that didn't help to make up for it at all!

I used to love this place. It seems to have been spiraling down the past couple years ... This last visit is my last. I ordered the Kobe burger at the outdoor grill. It literally tasted rancid but I had never had Kobe so wasn't sure if it was normal. I then headed in and bought some salmon sushi after throwing the burger out. I go back to the patio, open it up and take a bite ... The same thing --- rancid! This place needs major health dept inspections.

Marcel provided the most competitive quote for repainting the interior of our house. They did an excellent job with the painting, the guys who did the work were professional, and they cleaned up nicely after working each day. The owner of the company, Kelly, came out to check after the work was completed. Great job!

Ughh... the place was a train wreck before it was remodeled and it now looks nicer but the food and service is the same or worse. The staff is just totally disorganized and unprofessional. Everyone seems to be a newbie in the restaurant biz or is just unhappy working there. Even the chef seemed unprofessional and better suited for a burger joint. The food unfortunately doesn't make up for anything -- it's below average Italian that's way overpriced. Surprised this place reopened and is still in business!

the concept and environment are noteworthy, but not enough to get more than 1 star after my experience. i had a 3pm appt and waited over a half hour. somehow they put another guy in front of me without any appointment and didn't even have the decency to apologize when they realized the mistake. to top it off, the owner didn't seem to care whatsoever.

This place rocks in almost every way. The food is fabulous (and cheap!), the service is always friendly, and the location only 5 minutes away is awesome. The only thing lacking is the interior decorating. We always sit outside on the patio so it's not a big deal, but eating inside is definitely not the most luxurious of experiences.
