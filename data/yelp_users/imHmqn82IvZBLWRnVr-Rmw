This is my new fav lunch spot! Oh em geeeee!  I almost didn't come because I noticed the low rating (1.5 stars/3 reviews), but I am SO happy I checked it out for myself.  I'm new to the area, so maybe something serious changed? (management, menu, style?)  So there's 2 main sides - salad bar and sushi. I got salad - $6.99 for a plate! No weighing! Whatever you want on a plate for $6.99!!!! And I loved the options: garbanzo beans, edamame, beets, grilled veggies, house made hummus, etc. etc.  YUM  Plus they have some very affordable daily specials with soup/salad/drink.  TWO THUMBS UP.

Dr. Copeland at Desert Valley Dental is wonderful!  She's a very approachable dentist. Not only is she easy to talk to, she also takes the time to listen.  I appreciate that she's conservative in her treatment plan and truly cares about what's best for the patient.    While looking at my x Rays, she turned the screen to me and started explaining what she saw. No other dentist has ever done that!  That definitely helped me understand my treatment plan.  And she didn't try to "sell" me something I didn't need. When the screen in front of you displays your decay, you can't really argue with that.   The office has a relaxed feel, which I also like. My last office felt a bit pretentious. The rest of the staff is also great! They really made an effort to make me feel welcomed.  Can't wait to go back!

Pretty disappointed with the VIP tickets at this event. GA tickets were around $30 and VIP were $100. One of the main benefits of VIP was the free food. The tent ran out of food hours before the event ended and most people representing the San Tan VIP tent  had a "well too bad, ya snooze ya lose" attitude.  Running out of food is one thing, but the way they handled it really got to me.   And not sure what happened to Melvin Brewing.  They won best in show, #1 IPA, and #1 Pale Ale ... Then decided not to show? Maybe they made an appearance toward the end? Bummed I didn't get to try any.    Overall the event was pretty good. Good music, good venue, and good beer. Just don't waste your money on VIP if this event happens again.

The good- they take reservations The bad- it's still crowded/understaffed  The ugly-not the prettiest decorations  But for more a appropriate tag line, Orange Table is all about "The Missing" -milk -paper towels in the bathroom -coffee   WaitWhat?! Yes! They ran out of coffee. How does that even happen? It's a breakfast joint and people want coffee on a Sunday morning.  And all the extra little things were missing: -spoon with coffee (once it finally came) -cream with coffee (requested when ordered) -Bloody Mary (had to ask for it 3 times) -syrup with pancakes (who eats pancakes plain?)  The food was ok/good, but the road to the food was a struggle. The struggle is real.  Don't think I'll be rushing back here anytime soon.

Reasons to come here: 1- it's a part of DeSotto Market, which is a pretty cool spot filled with several tasty options and plenty of space to hang 2- fresh oysters! Yum! Prices vary depending what kind, but you can count on $1 oysters m-t 3-6pm and $2 oysters w-f 3-6pm 3- the people who work here are pretty legit. I don't always know which oysters to order so they'll explain brininess and size. And they'll recommend some if you ask 4- speaking of happy hour ... $2 off wines and $1 beers. That makes the sparkling rose only $6! 5- clam chowda. Yup. Get it.   Reasons why I'm not giving it a 5th star (if I could do 4.5, I def would!) 1- if you order here, they prefer you eat here. That's tough when you're with a group and they have limited bar seating 2- speaking of bar seating .. The seats are stools and don't have backs. It's not the most comfy thing to sit on long term 3- while the people are super friendly, they're normally pretty busy. You normally have to ask for more napkins, refills on water, etc. (hey I'm really stingy about that 5th star!) 4- parking can be tricky. There's a lot next door, but sometimes the gate is closed. There's a small lot across the alley and metered street parking (the kind that don't take credit cards)
