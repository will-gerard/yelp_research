Really rude on the phone. Hope she's nicer to the pets.

Excellent addition to the north Scottsdale restaurant options. The food was great. We got the charcuterie, French Dip, salmon, and the kale salad. Each dish was excellent.  Cody was our server, and was one of the most fun servers we have ever had. We will definitely be returning, and bringing others along with us. A++
