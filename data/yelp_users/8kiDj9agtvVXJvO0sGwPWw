This place is great! I got screwed over on Amazon for a Wii and called around to local pawn shops to see what they had. Most shops were selling Wiis for $50+, but here, Kat gave me a great deal on a bundle AND I got two games for under $10. They were kind, courteous and even hooked the system up for me in store so I could ensure that it works. Their electronics come with a 30 day warranty so if there are any problems, you can take it back. I plan to go back and scope out their laptops when mine finally takes a dirt nap (which isn't far off). Go see Kat and the team at Super Pawn on Central!!

I came here for lunch on 9/13 with some girlfriends and report the following: Atmosphere - We were there for lunch and arrived around 11:45 a.m. - JUST in time to beat the rush. However, I must say that they do a great job of getting people seated in a timely fashion considering the lunch rush. Noise level was pretty average for that time of day and I can say I've been in louder places. The seating was comfortable, we were at a table right near the door so we had some good people watching. I liked the décor and lighting as well. Appetizers - We got the fried/breaded veggies (forget what they're called) and Kioza (sp?)(pot stickers) They both were really good and not too heavy. It was perfect for three people. Entrée - I got the Chicken Parmesan and I must say, it is one of the best Chicken Parms I've ever had in my life. The chicken was breaded and baked to perfection; the noodles had the right consistency and although they could have done with a little more sauce and cheese, I can't say anything bad about it! Can't comment on beverages because we all had water, but some of the drinks being served throughout the place looked quite tasty. If you're looking for Italian or Asian Noodle dishes, come check this place out and if you're in the mood DEFF TRY THE CHICKEN PARM!

Ted and Bob's is the ONLY place I take my car. These gentlemen have been running this shop for over 50 years! They are knowledgeable about their trade, offer very fair prices and are always very sweet and understanding. When my check engine light came on they spent hours testing the lines and engine to see what was wrong and only charged me for the labor - gave me the replacement part! I refuse to take my car anywhere else. What I like most is that they are a small community business that has been in the area for over 50 years. They are family owned and operated.  If you ever need any car repair done, call Ted and Bob's and they'll fix you up for a good fair price.

Let me preface this review by saying that I've always had great service here. The staff is VERY FRIENDLY and I do not have one bad thing to say about this place's service or their regular pies. With that said.....  When I moved from Michigan it was hard for me to find good pizza down here. Papa John's is terrible, Little Cesar's is also terrible - THEN I FOUND NYPD!  I've only tried their regular pizzas and, this past weekend, tried their Sicilian pizza (which is essentially deep dish). BEWARE: the Sicilian pizzas are HUGE! If you've got two or three people to feed - the half size is PLENTY! ALSO BEWARE: the Sicilian is mostly dough, which soaks up all of the sauce and depending on what kind of toppings you have, ends up being very watery because of veggies. I ordered Da Works Sicilian and was VERY disappointed - which surprised me because I LOVE THEIR REGULAR STYLE PIZZAS THEY ARE TO DIE FOR! Anyway, the Sicilian is NOT A DEEP DISH - it's extra dough, under cooked and they didn't even have the courtesy to warn me HOW DOG-GONE BIG IT IS!  Otherwise, their regular pizzas are amazing! Totally worth $20 per pie. My favorite is between Da Works and Big Kahuna - they know how to do a Hawaiian pizza.   I recommend this place to anyone I run into looking for a good pizza joint!

Never having eaten from a Blimpie's I was excited to try them out and really surprised. I expected something like Subway, but they are blowing Subway AND Jimmy John's right out of the water. If I have my way, I'll NEVER GO BACK TO SUBWAY OR JIMMY JOHN'S AGAIN!  My boss bought me a sandwich-the Ultimate Club-which is one of their warm subs, so I can't speak to the price. But boy oh boy was my sandwich good. No sooner had he laid it down in front of me and it was GONE! The bread was great, they didn't skimp on the meat, the bacon was real and not that floppy chewy stuff-it had a nice crunch to it, but wasn't overdone and I really love their peppercorn sauce!  My boss goes there all the time so they must have good service and decent prices.  I recommend you check it out!

I used to be a huge Pei Wei fan, but the past few times we've gone there--especially last time-- I've been EXTREMELY disappointed.  I go to Pei Wei for the spring rolls and the chicken lettuce wraps. We usually order for lunch, so their lunch combos were always great because they came with an eggroll or spring roll. But recently they've changed their menu so I ended up with Pei Wei Spicy Beef combo which, per usual, had chewy meat, not enough sauce and too much rice. I also ordered the Thai lettuce wraps and let me just say STAY AWAY FROM THESE! It was such a confusion of flavors.. it was tangy and there was the hint of cilantro and mint... MINT! Gross! My boss took one bite and almost puked, he's a bit picky so I tried it and almost puked as well. We also ordered the Steak Lettuce wrap which was gross too. Super disappointing.  This place is way too pricy and now that they've essentially eliminated the ONLY thing I like there... they can close up shop as far as I'm concerned. I'd prolly eat here again if it was thee LAST place open and McDonald's has exploded. But for now, if I never eat here again, it'll be too soon.

This place is amazing! Where do I start? Carlos O'Brien's was my first eat-out experience when I moved here and I have gone back many, many times since. It's a great place to meet and eat - they have a huge restaurant with plenty of seating. The food alone is a reason to go, but the staff is always friendly and the service is very quick. My favorite dish is the CHICKEN FONDIDO! If you like fried chicken, cheese and cream cheese THEN LOOK NO FURTHER because the Chicken Fondido is the end-all be-all of amazingness! Granted that the food is not authentic Mexican, it is very interesting to combine Mexican and Irish food. Coming from a Spanish and Irish family, I felt quite at home looking at the menu and having to choose between corned beef and nachos. And it gets even better when you consider the prices. For the over-the-top portions you receive, the prices are very agreeable.  The atmosphere is clean, friendly and inviting. If you're on a date you can ask for a more intimate table and they will be happy to seat you somewhere you can kanoodle with your date. Drinks from the bar are prompt and put together correctly. Never once have I had to send something back to be remade - even when I've ordered complicated mixed drinks. A couple can go and have dinner, drinks and dessert for under $30. I really, really enjoy this place and highly recommend it to everyone: single people, couples, families and friends!

I called Integrity because my unit went out and I didn't realize how old it was. Integrity was out the next day and looked at my unit. The tech they sent was very friendly and courteous and didn't get frustrated when I couldn't answer many questions about the unit (age, performance history, etc. as I had just moved into the place).  I was hoping for a quick cheap fix, but had no such luck.  Although the estimate was high after shopping around I quickly realized these guys were giving me a great deal. They also turned me on to rebates for my new unit and gave me a discount on the labor and on future maintenance issues. I have recommended them to several family members and friends, some of whom have used Integrity and are extremely satisfied. What made my experience pleasant was the fact that they worked around my schedule and were on time for my appointment and once my unit was installed and I had some additional questions, I had no problem getting a hold of someone from Integrity to explain to me what I needed to know. This is a great company and I won't be using anyone else or recommending any other place to family and friends.

You get what you pay for and for what I paid, I guess I shouldn't have expected much more. The food was good, but nothing out of the ordinary for a burger joint. I liked the fries and the small drinks were HUGE.... but isn't that everywhere now a days. A+ for fast and friendly service. Prolly won't visit again--I'd rather go up the street to Micky D's for a Big Mac.

This Walmart is further from my house than another, but the other never has ANYTHING that I need. I come to this Walmart for everything. It is big, has a wide selection of clothes, electronics, and groceries as well.

I really love this place. Red Robin alone is a good place to eat, but the service here is great too--not always easy to find. We were seated promptly, brought drinks promptly and our orders were on point. Nothing was amiss and the services was very friendly. For the price, this is a good place to go.

This. Place. ROX! I'll never go back to Subway or Jimmy John's again! I had The Kind (Turkey, Bacon, Swiss n Shrooms) on garlic bread with veggies and mayo and BOY was it phenomenal! My husband got the AK-47 (French Dip with red onions, shrooms and provolone with mayo and lettuce) on garlic bread and that did not disappoint either. This place also has great snacks! I sampled a ball of mashmallow melted with fruity pebbles and it truly hit the spot!  I am looking forward to making this my regular lunch place every Sat while I do my laundry (24 hr laundry mat in same plaza) and am going to enjoy tasting everything on their menu.  They are open late AND deliver! If you're a toasted Sammy lover like me, you'll LOVE THIS PLACE TOO! CHECK IT OUT!

This is a good place to go if you're in the mood for something above Whatta Burger, but not as pricy as Red Robin--it's a great middle of the road burger joint. I also like that I can get a good sized side salad for $3 while my husband gets a customizable burger for $10 or $12 (depending on if he's feeling in the mood for bacon). The service at this location is fast and friendly--clean family friendly atmosphere.

This place is great! I was sick on Christmas day and so my family wasn't getting an extravagant home cooked meal. So we went to Denny's instead and I was very impressed with the service and the food. Our take-away meals were put together great and  they were still very warm when we got home. I ordered the Macho Nacho Burger and was NOT disappointed.  I was very happy that there was a place open so I didn't have to cook.

If you're looking for quality, organic foods, DON'T GO HERE! They don't even carry the regular Organic line made by Fry's/Kroger. I moved to this area and feed my family only organic fruits, veggies and products. The selection of organic fruits/veggies consists of three items - it's quite sad.  Not to mention the fact that the store was a complete disaster, like a tornado had ripped through there and tossed things off the shelves onto the floors...  Needless to say, I will not be shopping here again and I think it's disgusting the just because people don't live in an affluent part of town means they can't get access to organic products. I drove to the Safeway about 6 miles south and was very pleased to find everything I needed.

I really enjoy eating here. It's a great place to meet friends for coffee, breakfast or lunch. The prices are a little higher than average; however, the food and drink is surely worth it. I always get a Chai Frappuccino and an order of pancakes. The staff is always friendly and the service always quick. There is also plenty of browsing to do while waiting for your order. Luci's isn't just a place to eat; I often stop in to grab a few items for dinner on nights when traveling all the way to the grocery store is not an option.  I highly recommend Luci's to anyone looking for a good place to eat or find some coffee.

I. Just. LOVE this place! I work in the building upstairs and often grab a sandwich here for lunch. They are quick, friendly and although I think their sandwiches are just a smidge over priced--I buy them anyways because THEY ARE SO GOOD! If you're in the mood for a cold sandwich, I recommend the Little Italy-It's an Italian sandwich and if you're in the mood for something hot, go with the Liberty Bell or the Detroit Roast Beef Dip- Yum-O! They also have wraps and great salads (grab a Greek salad with their amazing feta Greek dressing-I buy the dressing in little cups and put it on EVERYTHING when I cook at home). There is a soup of the day and they also have super large fountain drinks for under two bucks. Their breakfast is great too and if you don't see something you're wanting on the menu, just ask Randy and he'll likely put it together for you if it's not too big a request (My boss often just wants scrambled eggs, bacon and toast, so they whip that up for her in a jiff). Seriously, this place is amazing!

Ok. So I had a review on here yesterday because I was in a pissy mood and kind of upset about other stuff and sorta took it out on City Market - SORRY! But today RANDY came to me and we cleared it up.  IF YOU EVER EVER EVER HAVE ANY PROBLEM EVER, ask for Randy. He is amazing and will do whatever needs to be done to fix your issue. They run a great place here. They have great food, great service and ... what else can I say? Go here. Eat Good. Be Satisfied. HI RANDY!!

I am a huge fan of Julio's! Their menu alone puts Taco Bell and DelTaco to shame. With a wide variety of items to choose from, including dishes with shrimp and fish, it is hard to NOT to find something to eat. What I love most about this place is that it is open 24 hours. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and has even cut me some slack on occasions when I placed the wrong order--they were kind and even made me an entire new plate. Also, the portions are quite large, I often can split a meal with a friend if we're not super hungry. You can also dine in at Julio's. They have a clean inside environment with plenty of booths and tables.  I recommend the Chimichanga--chicken or steak, or the Carne Asada burritos.

I came in on a Sunday to do a week's worth of laundry and was very pleased with the facilities. It's not a huge place, so I can see that on a busy day it would be very difficult to do a week's worth of laundry. Luckily, I came in when there were only a few people there. It was nothing for me to secure the three washing machines I needed for all of my laundry. The machines are clean, which is a HUGE plus because sometimes that's not always the case. I also want to point out that I had some delicate items that came out perfectly intact. The washers do not tear up your clothes. The dryers are very big and I was able to get all three washer loads into two dryers and have everything dried in about 25 mins. All together I only spent about an hour for a week's worth of laundry and spent only about $8 bucks -- very fair prices for laundry. This place is also open 24 hours and the area in which it is located is also nice and clean -- not scary. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere local to do their laundry. They also have a t.v. if you want to watch something (and no one minds you turning the channel), as well as free wifi, vending machines and a couple arcade games.  This place is in a nice plaza with a few eateries in case you get hungry while doing laundry.

This. Place. Is. AWESOME!! Nothing bad to say about this place AT ALL! I've been here on several occasions and the service is always prompt and friendly, the drinks are always mixed to perfection and the food... oh, what can I say?? Appetizers: Try the Cheesesteak Eggrolls. They are absolutely to die for! Entrees: I really love the Lamb Burger which comes with Roasted tomato, Arugala and Tzatziki Sauce. I added feta cheese to the burger and it was great! I also recommend the Grille Prime Cheeseburger: double patties with all the fixings, but have a napkin handy cause it's kind of messy. Their fries are of the shoe string variety and are hard to beat! But don't forget a side of Avocado Ranch for dipping! Sincerely, there's not much to say about Del Frisco's other than how wonderful it is. If you've never been and you're in the area, I HIGHLY recommend you check it out! This is one of my fave Phoenix places to eat!

I am a BIG fan of Priceless. The clothes are not only hip, cute and in style - you can walk out of there with a brand new outfit (bottom, top and undershirt or accessories) for less than $30! I purchase a lot of my clothes here and have always had good service. The staff is always ready to help with opinions if you need someone to let you know how an outfit looks - the last time I went in the sales girl was even nice enough not to lie and told me that what I had on was not flattering and suggested some alternatives that looked much better. What I enjoy is how the store is laid out - color coded so if you're looking for something specific, you don't have to rifle through every rack to find it. The only downside to these clothes is that sometimes they require mending. I purchased a silk over shirt for work and after three wearings and one washing a button came off - but for what I paid, I don't mind spending a few minuets mending a button or two here or there.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for something cheap and quick to wear out on the town.

I absolutely love Sprouts and was so happy when they finally opened a store near my home. First, the location is close and easy to access. The parking lot has plenty of spaces for parking and is easy to maneuver. Second, the service is always friendly. The staff is very knowledgeable about their products and where to find things in the store. Third, their produce is always fresh and they have a great selection of organic meats, veggies and fruits. And though the organic section is not very large, it is considerably larger than that which is found a Fry's or Safe Way. One thing that sets Sprouts apart from other grocery stores is their selection of granola, dried fruits, spices and snacks. They have entire isles dedicated to granola - which I love and make it easy because you can scoop the products into a bag and decide how much you need, rather than purchasing a pre-packaged item. The spices section is great because they allow you to scoop however much you need which is perfect for those odds and ends you don't use often, but may need for a special recipe. Their baked goods are always amazing- I'm a personal fan of the butterscotch muffins they make.  I highly recommend checking out Sprouts if you've never been there, and if you have, you're probably already a fan!

This place is GREAT! My boss took us here for lunch the second day they were open because it is his fave burger joint and since he moved from the Midwest, he hasn't been able to find one down here. I moved from MI so I can relate. Even though we went on the second day they were open and the place was a little packed, the service was fast AND friendly. I got the regular cheese burger and fries meal for $3.99 with a Mint Choco Chip shake that was to DIE for. There is nothing to say about the food other than you can't beat it. Burger Who? and forget McDonald's--I'll never ever eat there again! I have to be honest, I can't wait to go back.  We ordered four meals and two shakes all for under $30! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!  Great experience, great environment, great location (although parking leaves a little to be desired), and AMAZING FOOD! Go here. Order anything. You'll be happy!
