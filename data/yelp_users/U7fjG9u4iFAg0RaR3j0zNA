Great simple and easy fare. It is always tasty and a great quick fix. The triple gyro plate will bust your belly!

A local hot spot in a non-hot spot. The location for this fine restaurant is a little off the beaten path, but many have found their way to this delicious establishment as there is always a crowd from the moment they open. Not your typical Mexican joint. If you are looking for basic burros or tamales or chimichangas don't look hear. If you want a selection of thoughtfully created tastes and food then you will not go wrong here.

First time here and ordered the Bison burger. What a pleasant surprise! The burger looked and tasted great. Awesome selection of gourmet toppings and cheeses for the burgers and they are NOT small!

This is about as good as gourmet burgers get! BYOB takes on a whole new meaning at this growing valley establishment. Build Your Own Burger and that is exactly what you get. You can specify from a vast variety of meat choices. I recommend the Bison! Then buns, cheeses and a plethora of different toppings and sauces. There is no limit to the combinations that one could devise.  The service was very prompt at the Chandler location and friendly enough. The restaurant was almost full and the staff seemed a little hurried but still provided good service.  On the negative, it is not really suitable for children as the burgers are huge and as is always the case with all children, my children never want the same thing at the same time. It would be way better if the offered a combination of their sliders in 1, 2 or 3 for children or even for adults to savor different selections!  So yes I am a fan and we will be back. The children are already asking to go back soon so hopefully the menu options get some more children friendly options. :-)

Bison burger is the best! Tonight on a whole wheat bun, romaine, red onion, goat cheese, chopped garlic, grilled pineapple, dijon and relish. Nom Nom Nom!

I am so disappointed. The Ahwatukee area is always desperately in deed of better dining establishments, so with this new glass walled and open restaurant my hopes were high for a nice new local establishment. While the menu looks pretty good (I think breakfast might be the only saving grace here) the lighting for dinner, the service and the food were all exceedingly below par.  On a positive note the wi-fi and power outlets are a great add on, but they need to fix the food and service part and then they could have a winner.

This place is probably as close to a 5 star rating as it can be without being a 5 star. If you like raw, organic and natural food then this is a great mix of food choices with all sorts of flavors, delicious smoothies, teas, coffee and sundry other treats. Oh and don't forget to make them work behind the counter when you ask for 2 oz wheat grass shot. Love 'em! Yes, the prices are not cheap but well made food with honest to goodness good ingredients does not come cheap. You can eat cheap at fast food restaurants and we all know all to well what can happen in a paltry 30 days thanks to Mr. Spurlock. If you want to eat healthy and enjoy a tasty meal in the process I give Pomegranate Cafe a two thumbs up! Come on by and give them a shot. Of course I meant the wheat grass shot! :-)

Ok, I think I can speak for the majority of new car shoppers that while it is always an exciting process it is equally exhausting and never ending. I have bought two cars from Chapman before already and this is my third. I approached things differently this time and went through Costco to put me in touch with their certified representative at Chapman who is Michael Strickland. I cannot say what an awesome, simple and easy experience this was. Michael immediately sent me an email with what the bottom line was, asked what I wanted, did a search and couldn't find a new 2014 Durango R/T with what I wanted anywhere near by. I went in to see him and 30 minutes later I was out the door with the order placed for exactly the car I wanted at a really fair price. Simplify your life, use the Costco Auto Program, contact Michael and have him help you get the car you want. Done.  Thank you Chapman and Michael.

With 4 years of service performed on two VW's we have always been treated well and taken care of. Warranty issues were always dealt with promptly. Kudos to Neil Brownlee from service for always being prompt in his follow-ups and making sure things get done right.

Jimmy's food is great with awesome prices. The Hot Dog includes crisp hand cut fries and is only $3.35 plus tax. A good mix of menu items make this an ideal local business lunch spot. Come in a bit later to avoid the moon crush.

Certainly not a place for male bonding or a guys night out but this restaurant has the right mix if you need to take the girls from the office out for lunch to thank them for all the great work they do for you at the office.  The food is very pleasant and is a tasty artisanal version of a combination of country and home cooking. Everything that we had from salads to sandwiches and the desserts were delicious.

A fun local establishment that has a dog friendly patio. Busy weekend brunch makes for a vibrant environment. The beers are good and yes it is ok to have one for breakfast. The Grovey goes well the the French Toast.

Much like Sam A. (4/12/2012) we had an incredibly disappointing experience with the food. Our server was better and more attentive, hence 2 stars instead of 1.  To start with we found the Spanakopita to be incredibly salty, like they used a tbsp instead of a tsp. My wife ordered the Broiled Chicken Pita which I have had before and is good, but this time it was a disaster. The chicken was cold and the pita was cold and stiff. It got sent back and we got a new one which was better but still not as good as the Chandler location that I have eaten at before. I ordered a spicy chicken lavosh wrap. Now I love spicy food, but besides being spicy, this had absolutely no flavor. It seemed as if the mix had been marinating for a few days killing off any flavors that the beautiful ingredients should have had. Again very disappointing.  Not sure if it is because this is a new location or a large location for them, but I have experienced much better, and the food quality was so far off their standard it makes me hesitant about ever going back. It is not complicated food so it shouldn't be that hard to get it right.

Ok this is just so simple and ridiculously good. I have only found a few Neopolitan pizza places in my travels that I have enjoyed. Considering the format of Fired Pie with the create your own pizza from the ordering line, my first expectations were really quite low. I have been here a lot now and I can't find much to fault. The variety and quality of the final product is really good. Just go with your gut and order what you want on your pizza. You can put on any combination of any of the ingredients. Be creative and enjoy. I haven't had a bad pie yet. My only recommendation is don't make it too thick with too many toppings.  Give it all a try. I even tried grapes on mine today. Yes grapes! Think of them as an alternate to pineapple. A nice little sweetness, but not too much.
