Two stylists on Friday evening. I've been waiting an hour while chatty Kathy has managed to do 1 1/2 haircuts. The other stylist just had four friends walk in and he skipped one of them alllll the way to the head of the line. Cute. Too late for me to go anywhere else, so I'm going to keep waiting. Smile nicely and let my tip reflect my aggravation.

This place rocks!  I've been a pack of day smoker for over 20 years, and a few weeks ago I was doing some research on e-cigarettes to help me quit, or at least find a safer alternative.  My friend Tom told me about this place, so I went. They were super helpful, set me up with a starter kit and e-juice (the fluid that goes into the vaporizer). They were knowledgeable and friendly and took the time to explain to me how to use the equipment they sold me. Out the door for the price of a carton of cigarettes.  I went back the following week for more e-juice (in a different flavor) and I'm happy to say that although I haven't completely quite smoking regular cigarettes (they call those "analogs", hilarious), I'm on my way.  I currently smoke only two in the morning, and when this pack is done, I'm done.  This isn't supposed to be a review of e-cigs, it's supposed to be about Butt Out.  Simply, they ROCK.

Just stopped in there today, seems like a good spot, it was pretty busy (chaos!). They have a great taste test bar, and the lady that helped me (sorry, I didn't get your name) was super nice. I walked out with a bottle of Bangberry Mist and my oh my, isn't it yummy. $15 for a 20ml bottle of jVapes.  I'll be back.
