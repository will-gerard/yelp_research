Very helpful and friendly. Had problems with my AC and they got me in quickly as no AC in Phoenix summers suck and fixed my car while I was at work.  They worked with me to pick up my car later hours also since I had to work late.  Awesome place will continue taking my car there for any issues I have!

So came here for a friends birthday. Yes we were a larger party (15 people) however we had called ahead and told server ahead of time for the check splitting. The server was not attentive. We sat for extended periods without drinks. Our water glasses were filled though because the busser was amazing.  Half the table waited for almost 40 mins to get the checks and to pay and there was still confusion about who's check was who's.  Will think again before coming here. Over 3 hours for a dinner..no thank you.

I have used Lucky Me Pet Care a couple times.  Each time they were wonderful even when I had an extra pet on my last trip.  Heather and Amanda are amazing.  I have a rotti mix and some people hesitate and it's so great that they don't discriminate and give Aurora love each visit.  The hand written notes on each visit are great and love the Picture updates on my trips.  If it's a trip that I can't take Aurora they are the first people I will call and have recommended them to others.  Know that your pets will be well taken care of Lucky Me Pet Care while on your trip!
