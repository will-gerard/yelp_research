I've been using Future Service for years and I've never had a bad experience.  Brian is extremely honest and fair.  I've never once had to worry that he was being dishonest or trying to make extra money off me.  I recommend this place to everyone.

Working from home and felt like a breakfast burrito this morning.  Not a lot of quick, nearby choices so I was headed towards Jack when I decided I wanted espresso too this morning.  I got so lucky in that, forget about Jack I found out Steve's has breakfast food!  I've been to Steve's Espresso quite a few times since its nearby and their coffee and espresso drinks are fantastic.  My favorite is chi tea with a shot of espresso and soy milk prepared warm (not hot) so I can drink it immediately without scalding my tongue.  Lots of coffee shops offer similar, but Steve's tastes better and the staff actually know how to follow directions and produce a perfect, warm cup every time.  I'm not typically a morning person so this was my first trip to Steve';s in the morning (but won't be my last).  My chi only took a couple minutes for them to make, but while waiting I noticed a large display case with a little sign that read "Everything in this case made here, from scratch daily".  Contained within were a large variety of french breakfast pastries such as brioche.  I asked for a bacon, egg & cheese brioche and was told they had just come out of the oven.  A moment later I was holding a light, warm and fluffy pastry that is one of the best I've ever had.  Forget Jack for breakfast burritos, Steve's is a vastly better choice (and it was less than $3 too!!!!).

Been here many times before but its been awhile. Decided to go tonight and literally expected G. Ramsey to walk out at any moment and shut the place down. Seriously, it was complete chaos. They changed the menu. The guy taking the order kept walking off to check things. There was no ice or clean silver wear. The appetizer came out and was only warm and wasn't as good as usual. You could hear and see customers complaining and getting refunds all over the place. The staff all seemed confused. My entree finally came out, also not hot, but my girlfriends didn't show up for another 10 minutes.  All during this they kept going to the wrong tables with food and looking confused.  It was crazy, finally gave up, got a refund from the manager and went next door for dinner.  I won't be returning here again.
