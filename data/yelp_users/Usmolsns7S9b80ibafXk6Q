I went to Dart Force 1 today looking to buy some flights and shafts. I can say I've never meet a nicer lady than Patty. All the products I needed she had and at a good price. She was awesome to talk to and in the end I wanted to reach over the counter and give her a huge hug. Love to see a small business like hers be SUCCESSFUL! I will be back many times to come! Patty you're AESOME!

Went here for the first time tonight. Very cool place and the guy who helped me out was very nice. Great sandwich and didn't break the bank for something healthier than fast food. Will be back since the food was good and really nice people.

These guys are the best. I have had them do the systems in my last 3 cars. Really quality work and just fun to talk with. I've never had a problem with any of their work and couldn't be more happy supporting the business. They even helped me get my debt card out yesterday when it slide behind my ashtray. Great group of guys that do awesome work. I send my friends to them and everyone is happy. Thanks guys

I just picked up a Arizona burrito. The burrito was cold and the meat was un-eatable. I figure since it was the only thing open I would give it a shot. I feel like it needs to be good since they stay open 24hours. I am very disappointed that I spent 7$ and my time waiting to get a burrito that sucked! If it wasn't 12:45am I would go get my money back!

I tell all my friends this is a hidden gem of Tempe! You can get a great lunch special here and it doesn't break the bank. I love the family owned business and how in the afternoons you see their kids in there doing homework. The owners are so friendly and always say hello when I come in. Most times that hello turns into a great conversation about business. I couldn't be more happy with the food they serve and the atmosphere that comes with such a great little place. Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed!

I stopped here while my car was getting washed and detailed. I ended up talking with the manager of the coffee shop and started chatting about the coffee business and how the coffee beans come from Hawaii. I am not a coffee guy at all but he sold me on trying the coffee and I must say its GOOD! I am excited to see a business in that location that offers good service and a good product.
