So I went in to this place a couple of days ago because my neighbor said it was amazing. I'm not easy to please especially when it comes to Italian food. After dining here it's safe to say that it's one of the best mom and pop Italian restaurants  that I've been too! This is coming from a guy who has eaten at many Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. Arizona had a very short supply of these great tasting restaurants. So if you're ever in town and looking for a great Italian restaurant eat here. Service was great you can get a great sense of the hard work and love that Dino (owner) has put into this place. Wings are delicious  and for you anchovy lovers  you won't be disappointed.

Finally got a chance to go here and eat. When my wife and I first walked in it was packed. I thought  that the waiting time  would be long. That was not the case at all we were greeted at the door and seated  within 8min. The food was delicious , gravy, hash browns, bacon, eggs, sausage the whole nine. There servings are huge so be prepared to take home  a doggy bag. The only reason I'm not giving this place a 5 star  is because it took forever to get our food. Is it worth the wait? I just don't like waiting to long especially if I'm starving.

Oh goodness where do I even start. The customer service was okay, but the food was really not that good. They had a lot of old items out at the buffet bar that looked like it had been sitting out for 3 to 4 hours. I've been to my fair share of Americanized Chinese buffets , but this one was really Americanized and when I mean Americanized I mean it tasted so bad there wasn't even a hint of authenticity was in there. Most likely I will not be back. You would probably have to drag me. The only reason why I did give it 1 stars was because they had a pretty wide selection unfortunately they failed to deliver on the taste. My wife and kids didn't really care for it either and besides you really can not take the kids word for it. Thank God for my wife's cooking though and by the way she is Asian and her food is awesome!

So a group of friends and I went here on a Sunday afternoon after church . To be honest I have seen this place before, but live in the city... Sad  I know. The customer service was great and the food came out pretty quick. The taste was better than most generic Mexican restaurants out in Arizona. I had the cardne asada burrito, but I need to try other things. I recommend coming here.

Love the food here along with the exceptional customer service. I normally get a triple burger with cheese which is to die for. I don't care much about custard, but it tastes great and my wife and kids love it!

It's kinda hard to find it at first, but when my wife and I did we declared that we would come here for a donut and boba fix for life! Lol! . Service is great, boba is amazing, donuts are to die for. They make everything fresh and ready to serve. Oh! Before I forget their Thai tea  was tasty too! Also kinda random, but if you need buckets they sell them for 2 bucks a pop along with the lid.

Not into frozen yogurt, but it was pretty good. We came on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't to busy. The customer service was great too, but they take a  while to weigh the yogurt. Doesn't take 2 people to ring your order up.

The food here is amazing! It's one thing to have great food, but when you have great service too it's awesome. Ryan is the owner and you can tell that he cares about great quality food. They make their hummus from scratch and it's delicious! If you're looking for great tasting Greek food this place is hands  down the best on the west!

Okay so here's the thing these people are very friendly and have outstanding customer service. However I recently decided to change my own oil because I already had the tools and things I needed to do the job. Litchfield Auto has changed our oil for the past 2 runs, but it took me 3 days... Yes 3 days to remove the oil filter. Why? One might ask. I used every single method possible to remove this thing and nothing worked. So I had to remove the oil filter adapter along with the attached filter because it was on there so tight. On the third day I had my own neighbor give it a try and he couldn't get it off. So I went to Auto-Zone which was a waste and they were completely unhelpful. As me and my neighbor drove out of the lot he noticed an O'Reillys auto store which we then proceeded to go to. These guys helped me soooo much at O'Reilly, but it took us another 30min to get it off... They were baffled as to why is was so hard to come off. Turns out after they looked up that oil filter we found that they Litchfield Auto put the wrong filter on my car hence the difficulty in getting it off. I would've given a better review, but it just about ruined the treading for the filter adapter eventually leading to a bigger cost in fixing my car. And no I will not be returning.

So just three days after I wrote my original review I got a call from Phil at Litchfield auto. He was very polite very kind and just wanted to know what he could do to help out with my vehicle. I stated in my last review that their customer service was great and awesome and I stand by that comment. His concern was not about the review I posted, but expressing his concern for the safety of my family. So he ask me to bring my car down so at least he can check it because my family and I were going on a long trip to California . He went ahead and checked everything made sure my car was fine for travel and said if I ever needed anything that I could come and have him check on my car. He even went with me through a catalog to make sure that the correct filter was put on my vehicle at the time of service. So will I be back to Litchfield auto absolutely! Tamra was awesome as well. In the type of work that I do I'm all for small businesses so if you're ever on the west side or live near the area or maybe just passing through and are having any car issues if you're not sure about something go ahead and stop by at Litchfield auto and speak to Phil I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Great furniture store with awesome customer service. I didn't feel haggled when walking  in... Unlike other furniture stores my wife and I have been too. Another great thing is the huge selection they offer with same day delivery . It's also conveniently near the house which is great for us.
