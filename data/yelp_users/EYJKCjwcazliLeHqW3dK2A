Oh nomnomnom I've finally found really, really good Chinese food in Phoenix!  I admit to both a. never realizing this place was even here and b. likely not having gone in when on a Friday evening there were only 3 cars in the lot outside. But a New Times article recommended it so we donned our intrepid explorer hats and went in. So glad we did!   First, there are two menus- one most Americans are probably used to, and another that's more traditional Chinese. Go for the latter and try some of the more popular dishes that are labeled "recommended". The wings are so crispy and tasty- wings!- and the West Lake soup was a good choice on a cooler evening. We also had a pan fried noodle dish of beef and tomatoes, which was pretty perfect.   They even have a few items you have to call a day in advance to order- a neighboring table had a large soup served in a gourd called Winter Melon Soup that looked and smelled divine.   Don't miss this place. Look for the vintage neon sign on the NWC of Indian School & 24th Street.

Oh Saigon Pho, how I've missed you! My favorite of Vietnamese restaurants, so good no amount of scraping off that hateful cilantro will make me stop coming here.   Only losing a star for adding this new egg cake thing to my plate (kind of yucky, really). But the braised beef and shrimp is still great. And no one else has the crunchy pickled veggies I've become so accustomed to. If only you would open a location in Phoenix!  Two years living in the land of zero Vietnamese food was enough. I know where to get my fix now. :)

Met a dear friend I haven't seen in a long time for Sunday brunch at Boa. I'd remembered this place being great when I used to live here (before I left, then came back). While the ambiance was still nice and the food was ok, overall I was really just disappointed.   First request- I need tea. I'm a tea drinker. Any black tea. With honey, preferably, but I'll live without it. I don't even turn up my nose at Lipton. It's Sunday morning- caffeinate me. They don't have black tea. Only green tea. My friend did get her coffee, but when asked for a warm up later, the server refused and said they brew by the cup and she'd be charged for each one.   Food was nothing special, even though they tried. "Fried potatoes" at CB are not homefry-style, with onions and such. They're French Fries. French Fries served in a paper cone inside a spiral-shaped holder, which was a very awkward presentation next to the too-many-eggs omelette. It was what you'd get with a burger or hero sandwich. They were good but you know, just call 'em French Fries for heaven's sake.   Our server was rude, interrupting us a number of times while we were mid-sentence to check in, rushing to remove my plate before I was finished. I think she was just bored- there was still only one other table occupied by the time we left.   It sadly was not the experience I expected for a brunch. I tried to make up for it with a mimosa, but even that was not what I expected. And really, who isn't pretty easy when it comes to a mimosa?  I think they would do better to at least not call it Sunday brunch, since people have a certain expectation of what that means but they aren't trying to meet that.

I know, I've been remiss in my yelping. But this one is worth making the time to write for.  Quite possibly my new favorite restaurant: FEZ. We tried it on recommendation of a friend and I'm so glad we did. It was difficult to make a choice from the menu- it all sounded interesting and fabulously yummy. Since my recent discovery of a dairy allergy eating out has become something of a pain for me, but on this menu I had trouble finding stuff I *couldn't eat. The waitress was really nice and on top of things- even came back to suggest I might want to grill my chicken instead of leaving it fried since there's a tiny bit of cheese in the breading. (Good catch! And appreciated!)  The food was presented beautifully and there was enough to keep both of us full and happy. And did I mention how amazing our dinners were? I can't wait to go back and try more from their menu.  Definitely as good as it gets.

Yes, the macaroons are to die for. And yes, we love that it's locally grown and super-fresh - always. And, of course, the people there are welcoming and really nice to us and give great service. And it's even terribly convenient to get to.  BUT HAVE YOU TRIED THAT BURGER?? For us happy carnivores, a small slice of heaven.

We've been trying out Cosmo dog park for a few years now. We actually took a break for about a year, though, because the park was always so disgusting that one of my dogs was getting skin infections on his feet after each visit. We also had a ton of problems with smaller-dog owners not watching their dogs and being generally really stupid with their animals, endangering both their own dog and mine. More than once I had dogs who were unknown to me run straight for me and leap into my arms to escape being chased by a larger dog. Sad when the dogs come to me and not their owners!  I did talk to the town parks people about the small-dog issue, kids playing in the lake with the dogs (eeeeewwwwww!) and other issues, and they told me about their plans for the park. They do now have the timid dog area in place and more trash bins. Since we now have a second, younger dog, we decided to try it again this past week.   My dogs really liked the exercise and playtime, but the park is still really gross with dog crap everywhere. I didn't see a single person other than me pick up after their dog the entire time we were there. The small dog area gets used and I didn't see many issues with the little ones, so that was positive. But I am very concerned about health problems; both of our dogs got major soapy baths when we got home from the park. The parvo outbreak is significant this year and I don't think we'll chance going back.   I also don't think people should be bringing their little kids to the dog park- there was even at least one family there with a baby and NO DOG. One guy made a comment as I walked by that "now she won't ever be afraid of dogs!" Some of the dogs were literally nearly as big as me, and I saw some near-stroller-misses and some scary things for the kids- you may as well leave your baby sitting in the middle of the running of the bulls.   Cosmo is rated the best dog park in the country, and it could really be that if it was clean and if people had more common sense. It's not the dogs that are the problem....

update: after the last visit to Cosmo that I wrote about, first one with new dog Cody, he did in fact get a skin infection on his feet- a nasty one too- despite the major soapy bath he got when we got home.  We'll really just not ever go back. It's a shame, but I'll pay for daycare when he needs to burn off some energy- it's a lot safer.

Best NY style pizza in the Valley! I lived around the corner from the Chandler location for a few years and went all the time (delivery was always on time and arrived hot too). I still go out of my way to get pizza there.

Just had a meeting here and it was great. Nice big cup of tea and a great environment. Too early for food but I'll definitely be back to try it out!

First of all, thank you fellow Yelpers, because I found this great mechanic from you!  Gene was great- he checked out my car thoroughly and made recommendations. He didn't try to hard-sell me  and he didn't just "fix" what I was guessing might be wrong - both of which have happened to me plenty in the past. He also didn't rip me off, which I really appreciate. His pricing was totally fair and he had all of the work done in one day like he said he would. Not at all like the Hyundai dealership who kept my car for three days and never did fix my gas gauge!  But you guys - after checking my car and before I even knew when I'd have a day I could leave it with him for the repairs, it overheated on me and I was stranded at a gas station. HE CAME TO ME IN 10 MINUTES and got me back on the road. It was a seemingly simple fix but he dropped what he was doing and came straight over. WHO DOES THAT?? Customer service FTW!  Thanks to Gene (and a new set of tires from Discount) my 2003 Hyundai Elantra GT runs like a brand new car. I'd thought I might have to replace it this year but now that I found Gene I'll be able to keep this one (which I like!) much longer.   And his daughter, Kelley, is a sweetheart. Thanks for the lift, Kelley!

Wanted to leave a very big Thank You! to Dr. Evan Ware at University Animal Hospital.   We had boarded our dog for a few days (at a different place) and when we got home realized that Cody was whining and in pain. We couldn't see any obvious reason but where can you go at 7pm on a Saturday evening? UAH got us right in and did an exam and x-rays. Turns out there was a big mass in Cody's tummy and he needed surgery to figure out what it was and what to do about it. Dr. Ware did surgery the next day (Sunday!) and really managed Cody's pain both before and after. We hate to think what might have happened if we'd needed to wait two more days before getting Cody to a vet -  he would have been in agony and his spleen might have ruptured before then.  We can't say enough about Dr. Ware- his knowledge, communication skills and manner made us feel very confident having him take care of our smallest family member. He really cares about the animals. And he can handle our Google-centric questions. :)   I see a lot of comments about their pricing. My thoughts: look, having pets can be expensive. (ALL healthcare is expensive.) We had *great* vets out in the east valley before we moved to Tempe and while they weren't quite as expensive, they also weren't open nights or weekends, which is typically when Cody seems to get into trouble! The price difference between them and UAH isn't very much - I'll pay for the extra hours and services they provide. And when we move into CenPho soon, I'll still drive Cody down here to see Dr. Ware when he needs it.  As for the front desk staff... yeah, I'll agree. Not happy little rays of sunshine. Fortunately I'm not leaving Cody in their hands. The five stars are for Dr. Ware and the hospital's hours and services offered.

In my experience, Dr. McComb and staff are the best vets in the EV. Really caring, knowledgeable, always remember us and the dogs, and don't try to get you to do all sorts of expensive stuff that your dogs really don't need. They are really concerned with what's best for the animals. Also, the separate dogs and cats entrances are really helpful since my Jindo really does not like cats!  I've been to other vets- and one really, really bad one- and the experience here is totally different. You'll love Dr. McComb. Highly recommend! They're at McQueen and Pecos Roads in Chandler.

I have to agree with everyone- Loveland is a terrific boutique. Althea finds pretty and fashionable clothes, and I love that they don't look like they're from the mall. The kids' stuff is entirely too adorable, too.   Bonus- they have a doorway leading directly to Solo Cafe!   Plus, easy-to-get-to location and easy parking! Definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.

I wanted to see what parking options I had for a recent business trip so of course came to Yelp (my fellow Phoenix Yelpers are always so incredibly helpful!) I had an early morning flight out and late night flight back, and just didn't think I'd feel very safe in the airport's long term parking areas - they've always been a little scary for me when traveling alone.  Enter Blue Sky. I'll admit - my first thought when I saw all of the great reviews was that perhaps, fellow Yelpers, you've been lead astray. 5 star reviews?   For. A. Parking. Lot.   This native New Yorker wasn't having any of it.   Well you showed me, and for that I thank you because these guys really are that good!     From the happy smiles at 4am (happier than me, I admit) and instant pick up AT MY CAR - no dark, scary walks across sort-of-deserted lots here! - they really helped to start my trip off more relaxed than I've ever been when starting a trip. And no joke - I was at the airport in 10 minutes.   On my return, I easily found the shuttle back and even with a full load of other people, still got back to my car in maybe 15 minutes. Other customers were so nice - it's like the great service from Blue Sky rubs off on everyone! Drop-off was right at my car door, and the lovely driver even helped put my bag in my car.   Super clean and nice shuttles, excellent people - I'll never go back to regular airport parking again.

I spent a few years telling Craig at every session - "this shouldn't work".   I have fibromyalgia. I've done everything to manage it, including pretty radical things like up and moving to the desert when doctors told me there was literally nothing left to try or do except live where there's no cold weather. I was better, but I only got so far.  Then I was in a car accident and messed up my back, which set the Fibro all off again, too. Rather than try back surgery (which doesn't have stellar results), a friend referred me to Craig. To say I was skeptical is an understatement, but Craig explained what we know, and don't, and made me feel comfortable enough (needles!! ack!!) to give it a try.   I can say I've done Everything for the Fibro, and honestly, Craig is the only person who's ever really made a difference for me. No drugs, no "therapists" - just relief. And bonus - my dreadful allergies went away entirely, too! I wasn't expecting that, but there is no other explanation for it.  And yes, I also got relief from the back pain from the accident, although I still have a herniated disk that acts up from time to time. I'd still be going in for tune-ups if I still lived in the state. I felt so relaxed and good after a session!   Plus, Craig is just an awesome guy and I'm lucky to call him a friend now. Really, it doesn't get any better. :)

Joe is, hands down, the best realtor I've ever worked with.   What makes him so great? Start with excellent communication and people skills. You'd think that would be obvious for someone in his profession but trust me - it isn't. Joe is a true pro - quick responses to questions, great follow-up and knowledgeable as all heck.   Looking for a new home can be so stressful - I really felt like Joe genuinely cared about helping me find a perfect house and was a partner in it with me, which I needed. (I think he was as disappointed as I was when I got outbid on the first home I'd wanted!)   After not getting that house, we were really getting short on time if I was going to avoid moving to another temporary place and then moving again into a more permanent home. (Just typing that stresses me out. Imagine if I'd have had to move another time ... ack!) Joe eased my concerns and worked to help me get into a place before my deadline. His referral to Lizy at Prospect Mortgage was the perfect compliment, and between the two of them made a house happen in just a few weeks. Amazing.  Plus, he's just a super nice guy who you actually want to talk to. I've already referred him to family and friends with real estate needs. Seriously, I couldn't recommend him highly enough!

I just moved back to Phoenix and am now in the neighborhood - what a sweet find! They had way more (non-cow dairy) cheeses than I'd realized and fresh breads baked on location, a cafe and omg the wine! The gentleman who helped me was super nice and walked me through all the cheese options, of which I bought a couple because hello I can eat almost everything in this place (!) Prices are about what you'd expect for these lovely cheeses. The cafe menu looked very reasonable - can't wait to try it out. I'm reserving a star only because he told me in February they'll be licensed to *serve wine and when that happens I'm all over it!  Hooray for Another fantastic spot in Phoenix!

best. sushi. ever. The food is amazing, and prices reasonable. The owner was friendly and just, really lovely. First time here we brought a well-traveled family member who was also duly impressed with the quality and selection of food.

Lizy and her team were a referral from my (equally stellar) Realtor, Joe Maggiore at Desert Dimensions Realty in Scottsdale. They're a terrific group of pros who are also incredibly nice people.   Lizy was totally available to answer any questions I had, let me know exactly what she needed up front and the team's follow-through was perfect. They have great communication and were always easy to reach. They pushed my financing through in no time at all, saving me the aggravation of having to move to another temporary place before getting settled down again. It couldn't have been easier with Lizy's team.   I wish I'd known Lizy when I bought my first house all those years ago, and when refinancing the second. She was definitely the best lender I've ever worked with!
