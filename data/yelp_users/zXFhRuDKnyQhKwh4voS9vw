Excellent pizza and great service.  The Mediterranean Pizza and Moscato wine both get 5 stars.

I could not give this place a higher recommendation.  Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  The office is gorgeous with great views of the mountains.

Very inconsistent food and service. Sometimes good, but 80% of the time they screw up part of my order.

Had a burrito, but it wasn't very good.  The first half of it tasted like all beans.  The 2nd half was better, but still left a lot to be desired.  I was really hoping I'd like this place because it's so close, but I don't think I'll be back.  When I went, the place was packed full, but I was still served quickly.  Friendly staff.

Do not give these guys your real phone number!  They have probably called me 30 times and sent 5 emails in the last 2 weeks.  I have asked to be removed from their list several times, I keep blocking their numbers, but they keep calling from various numbers!

There's a Subway across the street, but after discovering this place, I will never go back to that Subway.  They have high-quality, fresh, and sliced-in-front-of-you food.  Prices are slightly lower than Subway.

Good food and value.  Have tried the Carne Asada Burrito and a Chicken Burrito.  The Chicken Burrito is massive!  Both were tasty.

A must-try-burger-joint in an unassuming spot; delicious, affordable, and a unique atmosphere!  Be aware of 2 things: - CASH ONLY - Be ready to yell your order at the guy well before you get to the front of the line.

Good food and reasonable prices.  -1 star for charging a 10% tip on takeout orders.  I also wish they had a happy hour.

I've been here about 10 times and am always pleased.  We always get great service and the food is always outstanding!  The chicken enchiladas are my favorite in the valley!

After shopping around, Discount Tire gave me by far the best pricing on new tires I could find.  I had an issue with my Lexus-branded valve caps going missing and replaced by black plastic valve caps.  However, when I brought this to the attention of the manager, he handled the situation professionally and promptly.  Although I didn't get my original valve caps back, things were made right.

This is my least favorite sushi place in the valley.  I think gas station sushi would have tasted better.  The edamame wasn't cooked properly and had too much salt, the tuna in the Alaskan roll tasted like it came straight out of a can, and the soda was flat.  The only thing that tasted okay was the water.

Went there for Taco Tuesday and was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservations.  We got a seat right away in the self-seating bar area, but it was the last table available.  Cool atmosphere and decor.  Only had the margaritas and chips and salsa.  Chips and salsa was good.  Margaritas were a bit sweet, but they were large and only $3.50.  Seemed like a fun little place, but I hated my date.  I'll go back there and explore a little more when I'm with people I like and I'll update my review accordingly.

I have been here many times and I couldn't believe I hadn't written a review yet!  If I'm a snob about 1 thing, it would be sushi.  I have a difficult time finding sushi I really like in Arizona, but this place never disappoints!  Sushi always tastes fresh and it is delicious regardless of whether I get a basic roll or a specialty roll.  If you come during happy hour, you can fill up, get drunk, and get out of there ridiculously cheap.  For example, I went yesterday for happy hour and got a carafe of cucumber lemongrass infused sake (probably about 10 shots) for $4.25, and 2 cali rolls w/ smelt eggs (highly recommended!) for $5.75, for a total of $10 + tax and tip.

All the pizzas I have had there were delicious.  They are all "build your own".  I really wish they had at least a few pre-built options to choose from for those days where I don't feel like being a chef.  -1 star for their sangrias.  Had a red and a white one.  Neither was very good.

The service was pretty good, but the food was mediocre and overpriced.  Also, they didn't have gluten free soy sauce, which almost all sushi places have.

I just got into mountain biking and yesterday I bought a new high-performance full-suspension bike.  I went here because I wanted to learn about my new bike and have it adjusted to fit me. They were really friendly, answered all my questions, and even answered the questions I didn't know I had.  They did the necessary adjustments to the shocks, brakes, seat and got it all done quickly.  They gave me tons of good advice, I learned a lot about my bike, and it was very affordable.  Will be back in the future and will recommend to friends!  Thanks guys!

Went on a Wednesday night around 8.  The guy at the front desk was very welcoming and friendly.  They had a special going on that I didn't know about for unlimited bowling until 10 (close) for $7/person.  The place is cheap and clean.  It's not the most technologically advanced bowling alley or the nicest one I've been to, but it works.

Excellent Pizza!  I had the Kosmic Karma and the Buffalo Chicken, both were delicious, but I preferred the Kosmic.  Happy hour was 3-6 (only mon-fri I believe) with half price drinks and appetizers.  I got a margarita for $3.50 on HH and it was pretty good.  Service was okay.

Cool place to try craft cocktails.  I tried 3 of them, but I don't remember which ones.  Far from my favorite drinks ever, but they all had a unique taste and were all very strong.  I enjoy trying new drinks and I never expect to like every drink, so I'm okay with this.  However, everyone else at the table liked all their drinks. They're a reasonable price ($5) if you go before 5 o'clock.  I went for a late breakfast (served until 1pm) and had the chef's special omelette which was excellent!  It was made with mushrooms, feta, spinach, and turkey this time, but it sounds like it changes daily.  -1 Star: I saw 3 female employees, all of whom had the hipster look which I'm not into, and I wasn't attracted to any of them.  Get better-looking women working there and you'd get 5 stars.  This is a nice place to go for drinks, but at similar restaurants the women always seem to be attractive.  Does this make me a jerk?  Maybe.  But Yelp is a place for honest reviews and I see nothing wrong with having standards.

Been here a few times and the burgers are always amazing!  Unique combination of ingredients on some of the burgers, but they haven't disappointed me yet.

Good food and good service.  Had the sausage pizza and fried ravioli, both were good.  They had some type of plumbing issue that made the restaurant smell bad, but we ate on the patio so the smell didn't bother us.  We will probably return in the future.

Delicious food! It's a weird menu so I was a bit apprehensive. Had the fried cauliflower for an appetizer, it was perfect. Had the chicken sandwich which was almost as good.  Edit:  Came back for a 2nd visit and I had to lower my rating by 1 star.  Had the Fried Cauliflower for a second time.  It wasn't as good this time, because it had more buffalo sauce and not as much blue cheese as the previous visit.  I also had the brussell sprouts which were OK, but I wouldn't order them again.  Pita and hummus was outstanding.  On their happy hour menu they have "premium mixed drinks" for $4.  However, they charged us a $1 up-charge for our standard drinks such as Vodka OJ and Vodka Grapefruit.

Positives - Very friendly staff, good food, fair prices, nice restaurant with a good atmosphere.   Negatives - Rolls need descriptions on menu, pictures would be even better. Instrumental music plays which is fine for the atmosphere, but the music is too loud. It's not a party restaurant and the music needs to match the atmosphere. Would give 5 stars if not for these negatives.

The Good: Grilled fish tacos = Delicious   The Bad: Margaritas (yes, at "modern margarita" the margaritas were terrible)  Okay: Pork Tacos Guacamole Chips & Salsa = pretty good, but they were out of the chipotle salsa so we didn't get to try that one even though we paid for it.

I used to like this place until I got food poisoning the other day (3-9-16).  I can't say for sure if the food poisoning came from Sushi Style or from a previous meal.  I understand this can't always be prevented (especially when preparing a dish with raw fish) and the food poisoning itself is not the reason for the 1 star review - the reason for the review is the way the manager handled my phone call the next day following the single most miserable night of my life.  I started feeling uncomfortable about an hour after my meal.  2-3 hours later I was either on or hugging the toilet the rest of the night.  The manager chuckled when I suggested it may have come from this restaurant "because food poisoning doesn't happen until 12 hours after a meal."  Wrong, it can happen as little as 30 minutes after a meal and almost always occurs within 12 hours.  She tried deflecting any and all blame, didn't take down my information, and almost didn't even ask what I had to eat.

Great value & delicious food!  Been there quite a few times now.  I have only tried burritos and the wet burrito.  Setup is similar to Chipotle, but Santos Lucha Libre has more options and better food.  I love Chipotle, but to compare Santos to Chipotle is a slap in the face to Santos.  They have a sign out front that reads "1 pound burrito".  My burrito was massive, so out of curiosity I weighed it...1.5 pounds!  Cons: - Their restaurant is themed around professional wrestling, so they have masks all over the place, and it's creepy as hell!  Because of the decor, I could never eat there; I always get my food to go.

This place is a ton of fun, even if you don't know how to golf!  Check it out, I doubt you'll be disappointed!  Go on weekend nights for a party atmosphere or during the daytime for a chill vibe.
