These girls here rock... Not super cheap for drop off... But sometimes? A nec treat!  They r so nice, professional n quick !  Also a great place for the over sized items. So lucky they r close!   hate that i have to go to laundromat sometimes... but, at least there is a decent one when the need arises!

If less than one stat were poss  the service was horrible, the wait...outrageous,.. the manager was so inappropriate to his employees in front of the public.. when i called to complain  he was a jerk and cared less about the service that was provided and satisfying the client WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!  which is a shame, literally around the block from my house... if he would of made right by me, i would have been a loyal patron.  his/their loss

okaaaay...!  freaking yumm!  skeptical...just cuz i am... and i'm not a big sub person... too much bread in a carb addicted world w a 5ft bod... took me almost 2 months to check this place out... took awesome advice...order the "#9 mike way"  they cook their roast beef on the premises daily.. i'm a sucker for a good roast beef... won't eat if not worthy... sooooo good!  ate the whole frickin thing... my friend got the philly cheese steak w jalepeno...darn tasty.....and a peanut butter cookie that i wished would never end.,.  top that off w yummo iced and great service w an affordable price(don't know where other peeps think too high.... for what you get, i'm down w it!)  only problem....  i need to go back daily to sample whole menu....and i'm already craving another #9 mikes way...see my prob? def b back sooner than not!

All around awesome experience!  Took advice from other reviews and ordeed the very popular bisquits n gravy (w hash browns &eggs).... ok, so I'm picky, I will admit this freely!  If I'm going to pay for a meal w my money AND my hips...it had better be HOW I like it...and damn good!    One word....YUMM!  They did my eggs and hashbrowns just like I requested (yes, there is a little meg ryan in me...harry met sally...) and the bisquits n gravy were as good as people said!   Service was great.. Sunday morning...wahoo!  No wait!!  Ben was our server.....very prompt, very personable, friendly and a great server!  can't wait to go back!!   yay!   love new finds, thanks yelp!!

This place makes me sing my happy food song!  (Yes, I am that dork that humms happy happy joy joy when the yummy-ness occurs!)    I went last week to meet a friend and was treated like royalty...we tried 10 dishes including baklava and rum cake! 1st of all, the eggplant app... omg!  then the Kabbobs were so full of flavor served w fragrant rice.... saffron rice!! Almost cried!  Childhood favorite....amazing... AND THEN... the specials... WOW!!  Pomegranate  Chicken... and Barberry Rice and  Chicken!!!!!    The owner is so personally involved, everybody seems to know him  (better than Cheers!!)  and seek him out w greetings and hugs.... and he seems to find newbies and welcome them all.    The kicker... all this @ an affordable price!!!   Love it and can't wait to return!!!  Ya'll gotta go try this place n SING! Tell em Synia sent you!!

we love love this place!!  Found by fluke on yelp if course... Not wanting to drive back to Scottsdale to our former fav pho place.. Looking for one closer to our neighborhood.   Rice paper was a wonderful surprise!  Cute lil old house turned into restaurant.. Atmosphere is awesome casual.  Full bar w interesting drink menu (although I haven't tried any cuz I don't think to drink besides water w my pho!) appetizers awesome.  Pho amazing and the service too. Wahoooo. Dominick was sup sweet & attentive the 2nd visit.. But since then James has become out regular server and we adore him!!  Thx James n see you soon!!
