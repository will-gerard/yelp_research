PHX is a smooth running, efficient, clean airport I actually enjoy flying in and out of.  Kudos to everyone at PHX International for their great work. I don't ever encounter other airports that have hired representatives to answer your random questions in suited coats along your way to your gate, Phoenix International does though!  The purple suited representatives are always so pleasant!  I happen to be fond of a select few airports in the U.S. based on my traveling experiences over the years.  My reviews take into consideration the airport's work attitudes, level of work quality, cleanliness of facilities & efficiency of operations. Among the top rated of these facilities include (but are not limited to): Burbank (BUR), Omaha (OMA), Phoenix (PHX).  Some of my worst rated include (but are not limited to): Kansas City (MCI), Chicago Midway (MDW), Salt Lake City (SLC).

I absolutely LOVE THIS PLACE.  My cousin and I waited at the door for them to open at 9:00 AM.  When we entered, I was in heaven.  Guns filled the walls and they practically have ANY gun to rent- From a Glock pistol to a mini UZI and the AK-47.  My cousin and I rented an AR-15 and a Beretta 9 mm to start.  Both great guns and fantastic to shoot on their range, which features the most up-to-date target retrieval technology.  Since it was our first time at the club, I asked that they walk us through everything thoroughly and they did a great job.  The staff was extremely accommodating and I can't say enough great things about them.  High honors for the Scottsdale Gun Club- Highly recommended!  Also if you're wondering, you DO NOT need to be a member of the club to shoot at the club.

I love The Good Egg and especially this location. Ever since Melissa became the manager, it has gotten even better.  The food and service is always consistent for my family and I.  They have an extensive menu of traditional American breakfast choices in addition to healthy options for the health conscious.  When you get sick of being served dessert for breakfast (aka PanCAKES), give this Good Egg location a try.

Sometimes it's really hard for restaurants to find good employees.  I have found that MOST of the time, as long as a restaurant has a responsible, most likely older manager on staff for all shifts, even the youngest employees will work to the best of their ability - sometimes even surprising themselves.  So when I first visited this store and saw the cashier texting on his cell phone (he claimed he was texting his manager), instead of preparing my transaction, it made me very frustrated!  I would go back to this store if my guests wanted to have subway subs, however ONLY because they are the nearest location within a ten mile radius or so.  Chances are the help will have been fired or quit and then rehired the next time I go.  This is the nature of the restaurant business.

MTM is a GREAT place to ride!  Patty and the gang really give you five star service.  They really go out of their way to make your experience the best ever.    The last time my Family and I went, one of our Family members was weary about riding and they were very accommodating.  On the ride, the guide did a great job easing the mind of our weary rider and gave us a fantastic tour of the area!  Thanks MTM, we will definitely be back soon!

Purchased a Salsa El Mariachi Ti from Flat Tire a couple months ago.  All of the guys were incredibly easy to work with & very friendly.  Each of them was a wealth of knowledge- amazingly keen on mechanics & bike fit.  I can't wait to see their new store location as well!  Thank you Manny, Joey & Kaolin!!  Highly recommended!

I would give Flapjack's five stars because of their enormous variety, originality and wonderful service HOWEVER, I do agree with other reviews that this place is overpriced.  Despite this, if you are looking for a good local meal & you don't mind a higher price, this is a good option.  Their food is pretty straight forward diner fare; Pancakes, eggs, what not.  The atmosphere is a bit rustic and fits the feel of the cowboy town.  The diner is a bit small, so get here early if you have a bigger group and don't want to wait, especially on the weekend mornings.

I've been going to Bonnie's for awhile now.  In addition to numerous dog & cat food options, they also offer doggie teeth cleaning.  When I brought my dog here for her last cleaning, I was very pleased with their work.  The Dr. is a traveling doggie dentist that makes his rounds to Bonnie's on a monthly basis.  He was very gentle with my dog & did the work without the use of anesthesia, which is crucial for me given my dogs small size.  Overall, given their prices, selection, level of service and expertise, I give them a 5 out of 5 rating!

Went with my family for New Years Eve.  The drinks were weak and they left the doors open so we were freezing!  Overrated!  This location lacks a personality- it a cookie cutter version of Buffet's tropical locations.  On the plus side, the bar food was great but I wouldn't probably go back... Definitely not for New Years Eve!

This location is a great place to get your coffee and go.  They have a drive-through!The staff is consistently friendly, for the most part, as is the coffee consistent.    Beware however, on a peak time, 7:30-8:00 AM, you will be waiting for a very long time & may not be able to cue for the drive-through line due to lack of waiting space.  A bonus about this location is that, because they deal with so much customer volume, they are a "designated open" Holiday Store.  Want coffee on Christmas Day?  No problem, they will be open here!

I LOVE this place!  They've got some greasy delicious eats!  Their burgers are fantastic & flavorful (I can tell their beef is fresh & never frozen).  They have a large variety of different treats but their burgers are their feature flavor!  A little history... In 2013, this restaurant was featured on a reality TV show called "Restaurant Stakeout".  The show involved setting up hidden cameras & catching employees in unruly acts.  SPOILER ALERT.... The Earl's "saucy" episode featured a waitress being naughty with someone in the bathroom... Absolutely hilarious.  Just in case you haven't figured it out- "reality" TV shows are scripted & actors are hired. Waah-Waaaah.  It was all staged... BOOOO!!!  Although, it was one hell of a restaurant plug!  It got us talking about it, right?  Now go there, eat their awesome burgers and do naughty things in the bathroom, people- we've got to make this "reality" TV more real!

I love to shop here!  Don't get me wrong, it's called the "Purveyor of Fine Foods" for a reason, it is expensive.  "You get what you pay for" is not ALWAYS an acceptable or applicable philosophy, however with AJ's it is.  Their store presentation and departments are often impeccable and most definitely aesthetically impressive.  Top five reasons that AJ's (this location specifically) qualifies as a "Purveyor of Fine Foods":   1.  Sit-Down or Pick-Up Sushi Bar with a Professional Sushi Chef... Fresh sushi and sashimi made daily on site. 2.  Gourmet Meals To Go... Choose from meals such as Marinated T-Bone, Fresh Alaskan Salmon, Marinated Pork Loins (menu varies daily).  Individual plates or group order Thanksgiving & Christmas Meals served every season (Pre-Order for group orders required). 3.  Large Wine Department w/Wine Specialist On Hand For Pairing Recommendations Or Special Orders... Their wine specialists are superior in job experience and expertise. 4.  Artisanal Floral Department...  I have never seen any other floral department in any other grocery store compare to the arrangements at this AJ's.  Only a floral company such as "Cactus Flowers" compares to their talent. 5.  Exceptional Produce... They have so many different options.  Also, if you need a fruit or vegetable not on the floor, they most likely can order it for you!  Honorable mention- the Bakery Department.  Small, but fantastic!

I am very impressed with this store!  It's consistently clean and the staff have always been helpful and kind to me.  In each department, I am impressed by the selection of products they have to offer.  The produce department has always been well stocked for my trips, with only the exception of one occasion (due to a national lime shortage).  I appreciate that there is a bank location and a Starbucks location within the store as well, not to mention a gas station with reduced fuel prices for Safeway Card holders.  For the most part, the entire store is well lit and the products are almost always well stocked.  Overall, I think this store deserves five stars because of the quality it consistently offers it's customers.  It's no AJ's, but it's also more reasonable in price!

Had an AWFUL experience with a server named Justin & his manager Phil the other night.  My family and I received awesome service upfront & then were ignored, pretty much the rest of the movie.  All we wanted was the server to followup with us, get us refills and some ketchup.  Not too much to ask right?  We ended up getting a wrong drink, the wrong bill and being ignored, all for a total of $130 (three of us).  To top it off, the server Justin and his manager Phil refused to apologize.  A surreal, miserable experience I never want to endure again...my advice to others, go to the Studio Grill!!!  This place doesn't deserve your business.

Okay, let me just start out and say that rarely do ANY of my reviews go from 1 Star to 5 Stars in the course of one visit.  However in the instance of my recent visit, this is definitely the case.  Please preface my earlier review before continuing...  So after enduring my last miserable experience with iPic, I was contacted by a customer service rep, then I was put in contact with a local manager named Lawrence (Larry).  Larry apologized for the instance and said he just wanted to make it right & I was very appreciative of that.  He offered to have my tickets reimbursed, for which I was also very appreciative.  He took down my information: address, phone number.  I then waited for my passes in the mail, but to no avail.  Many months pass by, still no passes.   Because I have recently been making a transition to the valley, I was in town last week checking up on my new home build.  I then, once again decided to readdress the issue with the hope of some final resolution. I called during the day and reached a manager named Brian Vogel.  I explained my situation about my "lost in translation" phone call with Lawrence and my previous horrible experience with Phil & Justin then Brian said he would call me back.  5 minutes later Brian called me & apologized for Larry's mishandling of the situation & my previous experience & offered to make it right with passes.  Brian went above and beyond and provided me with his direct number in the case all was not satisfactory on my next visit.  Fast forward to later on that week.  I treated my family to the new Farrely Brothers movie, "Dumb and Dumber To".  There were six of us & I used the three free passes on the event.    My other two family members that hadn't been back since our incident with Phil & Justin (Heckle & Jeckle) were present with me and were very happy with the renewed experience.  Our waitress Alesse was very kind and tentative with our drinks and food orders and we ended up having a fantastic time!  Unfortunately I wasn't able to meet the fantastic Manager Brian Vogel in person that night (because the movie played later in the night), but I definitely look forward to it in the future.  I want to shake his hand & tell him thank you!!!!  Also, if you get a chance Yelpers, if you've also enjoyed a great experience at this theater, Brian deserves props.  Please let him know.  He's a kind, fantastic Gentleman that genuinely cares about his business and his customers & that definitely deserves a pat on the back!

Gabe definitely deserves 5 stars!  I recently moved into the Phoenix area; in addition to getting me really good rates on my home, auto & rec vehicles, Gabe helped me get in contact with some recommended professionals in the area (house cleaner, pool cleaner, landscaper).  This has saved me a lot of time & I am very grateful for that!  Also, what other Insurance Agent do you know gives out their personal cell phone number to clients to call or text if they have questions or concerns regarding their policies?  Gabe does!  I initially found Gabe on Yelp, actually & decided to give him a shot on a quote.  He was very persistent and dedicated to acquire my business.  He explained how the policy offered at a discount recommended by my builder could potentially put my home liability at risk due to the limited coverage it offered in that area.  I quickly discovered his way of doing business to be honest, caring & confident.  I, without a doubt, recommend Gabe & his team to anyone looking for a reliable go-to local Insurance Agent that authenticity cares about the welfare of his clients.

After reading all the negative reviews from fellow Yelpers about the service & seeing a "help wanted" sign on the door when I drove by, I decided to give this place a try.    Probability has it, if they are seeking new servers, they must have fired the bad ones.  Right?  I have to say this is a likely possibility.  When my family and I decided to eat lunch here yesterday (Dec. 31, 2013), I believe the service has gotten a lot better (based on Yelpers past experiences).  Our waitress "Daniele" was on top of things & very kind.  She even had a good sense of humor when I asked for a wheelchair...  (I stuffed my face with the $5.50 giant pizza slice & soda rather quickly).  So anyway, if you're like me & want to take a risk on good food and possibly bad service but are willing to be surprised, give this place a try.  I think it deserves better than 3 stars based on my experience yesterday.

This cafe got off the ground 3-5 years ago.  It had a change in ownership I believe.  Since then, they have been going strong, and for a good reason.  Their coffee is VERY good, not to mention they have a large selection of various beverages (beer, wine, tea & smoothies) and quality food options.  The Grotto is a great place for breakfast & lunch.  They offer some fantastic menu items, some healthy, some not so healthy, but definitely a good balance of both.  Wi-Fi is free, so you are welcome to make it your "comfort space" if you have the option of working outside of your home.  For a more detailed look at the menu options, see their menu posted in the Yelp photo section of this business.

Gyros are awesome!  Owner is Greek American!!!  Not a fan of the waitress Nancy though- she is straight out of Ed Debevics. Insulted me for ordering a reubin and a pancake on the side.  Ask to NOT sit in her section.  Seriously, she's THAT bad.  A good indication of this is, when you ask her her name, she never gives you an honest answer.  She literally lies to your face so you won't complain to management about her.  I'm surprised she's still there!  Good wait staff and highly recommended is Greg.  He's very attentive, kind and quick on his feet!  Just look for the big burly muscular Dude- that's Greg.
