This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix. Cannot wait to go back. Service, food and ambiance and price for what you get ( price fix menu) were great. The only small issue was that it was really packed with people & some of the people in wheelchairs/walkers had a tough time getting through. They even have a cookbook!

Ok I will be short but what I have to say is not so sweet. I am astounded that this place is still in business.  We went this last Saturday night and were treated horribly. After an hour of waiting for our food and not having been acknowledged by our waitress. My husband & I got up to leave. (The people next to us had fininshed thier meal and they had been seated 20 minutes after us.) We asked to speak to the Mgr. He did not come, only sent the bill for our food ( that we never had recieved) and said that he would have it wrapped up for us to go. When we stated that we wereonly going to pay for what we had been served the Mgr (then suddenly appeared &)   said that he was going to call the sherrif. I think everyone has expereinced bad service but this place literally takes the cake.

Was good. I liked the tacos and they were a great price. I just liked my husband's meal -the chicken enchiladas much better than the tacos. The waitress was very nice and and let us use our coupon from the money mailer even though techinally we didn't order 2 entrees. It is close to home and was a good experience. The only real issue that I had was they only carry pepsi products and I prefer coke.

I really liked this place. Not pushy w/ the sales aspect of things. Very nice artsy little shop with top notch products that are not too pricey. Roxanne is great got a fantastic cut, hand written thank you in the mail and a call on the specifics of how to use the mouse I purchased. Impressive customer service- I will go back again. Victoria

OK this place is a nice break from the work day. We love going here for lunch or dinner. Great decor, staff  and fabulous food at a good price. I mean 3 huge tacos for  5 dollars is a deal (esp. because nothing is fried). My favorite thing about this place besides thier buffalo chicken sandwich (on special days) is thier frozen lemonaide. They come with an umbrella and I love the cheery feeling I get  walking back into work w/ my to-go unbrella drink.

My husband and I loved this place. It keeps things simple by telling you that all the items on the menu are 475 calories or less. This way you can just order and relax and noot sound like " could you pls just put my dressing on the side, grilled instead of fried pls, ect."  Our waiter james was awesome-  prompt and funny. Last thier piano bar singer was phenomenal. Will be back as soon as we can convince a family member to watch our kids again.

I was really impressed. I believe the man's name was Mike ( he did the work a few weeks ago). He came out and installed a chandelier in my bathroom. The kicker was that I needed a trim peice to go over the wall/box in the ceiling. This man went to lowes and picked out the perfect one and chandelier light bulbs. Also he informed me prior to the install that the ight bulbs i needed were from france and would have to be specially ordered. I had him do the install anyway. For everything it was $120 and what a nice guy. The next day I got a call from him that he found adapters for the bulbs so that I wouldn't have to order bulbs from france. He came by & put them in and the charge was miniscule. Very Happy w/ my chandelier that I have waited a decade to put up.

We are Super grateful for being able to be part of CLS. My oldest son was in a well known accelerated program in PV school district and to say it lightly that was a hot mess. I went to the tour at CLS and was so amazed that I asked my Mom " are we being Punked?" From the piano music coming out of the chapel to the specialized attention and care my boys receive I couldn't be more thrilled. My oldest son is a bit ahead of his grade in some areas but his teacher went out of her way to create a secondary curriculum for him in these  areas so that he stays challenged and excited. The level of character building and accountability that exists at this school is unparalleled. It takes a village:)
