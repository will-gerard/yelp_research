i luv how u can get pretty much everything u need for a carne asada grill session.  they got real hardwood charcoal for cheap.  i'm not really in2 sour cream, but the fresh creme con sal is so good i really have 2 stay away from the stuff or i'll go thru a tub a week.  they have a great selection of cheeses, ne kind of meat ur lookin 4 and they will put it in a marinade that tenderizes perfectly, fresh juices, salsas, and an awesome made-to-order deli.  if they have the bacon-wrapped hot dogs, highly recommended with the worx!  from the deli, i like pretty much about everything.  tortas to chile verde, tacos dorados to menudo.    their produce is crazy cheap, but not the best i'll admit.  of course, if u're lookin for a one stop mexi-shop, this is the place.

me WUVS this place! great food, great service.....   their sake steamed clams r awesome if ur a fan of the clam!!!  i heard their ramen is good too..... but haven't had the chance.  been here about 3 times and can't wait 2 go back.  there is nothing i've had that i didn't like.  o yea..... and the shrimp lettuce appetizer..... mmmHmmmmMmmm............ pad thai.........uh huh.  apparently japanese do italian very well and i'm interested in the chicken marsala.  srsly..... ne place that serves soft shell crabs is A+ in my book.

this time around i got 2 try the ramen.  i got the hakana.  prob woulda been better for a colder day.  the broth was too salty for me but the noodles were good.    still got the clams so i was satiated.

I've come here various times, with the service varying also.  I don't like the females work outfits of 'japanese' dresses either.  the late-nite sushi is the 1 thing this place has goin for them next to the trendiness.  never had any of the kitchen food, but the sushi has gotten progressively worse.  i had some toro one day that smelled and tasted really fishy and oily.... meaning it was old.  if you're cheap, u can sit in the bar, have drinx, and free rolls.  haven't been back since the toro incident.  i think sushi chefs should have a standard of what they serve, so i don't trust the judgment here.    if you like paying for atmosphere, go here.  u won't b paying 4 what the sushi is worth.

most authentic japanese i've had made by real japanese people.  (if u don't know, most sushi restaurants and japanese restaurants are actually owned by koreans lols).    the guy is an old-skool asian guy, not grumpy, but not nice.  he does what he does.  atmosphere needs some music, but food makes up 4 it.    if u order a dinner, u get a yakitori skewer and OMFG it makes the meal.  lightly crunchy outside, juicy flavorful chicken on the inside.... srsly.  the only thing i don't like is how sweet some of the japanese sauces are.... but that's my own personal preference.

I've been goin here off and on for years thru 2 different owners.  It's just kinda far, but the drive is worth it just for 1 of their baked mussels.  Fresh sushi and katsu.  What else do u want?

I've only had take out from here so i don't know about the service.  all i've had is the food and i'm always extremely happy with that, even if it does put me in2 a food coma.    things i've had from here include:  chicken (fried or smothered, i want 2 swim in a pool of their gravy) fried okra greens (these r so good, better than the greens i've had from Roscoe's) rice/beans cheesy eggs  the cornbread is kinda dry 2 me, and i'm not a fan of waffles or grits neway.  but i will say this is the best fried chicken in town hands down!

The new spot is pretty nice. Definitely enjoyed the patio with the beautiful weather.   Long story short: I've dined in plenty of times now and the food is consistently awesome and the service is always spot on.    Only request: I miss the greens from their old spot when they used to be spicier with red pepper flakes. Either way greens r still tasty and I get the spice from the hot sauce.

Better lunch prices than the fast food chains. I've been coming here for years.  Actually, back in the day when I still lived on this side of town, I ate here 3-6 times per week.  My favs include the antipasto salad, steak special + jalapenos sub, and fried mushrooms.  You can't beat the 2 slice lunch special for like 4 bucks i think.  The pizza &  wing special is classic.   Family owned by Italian guys with humor.  Sheck 'em out!  I wish they had one of these on the Eastside and then I wouldn't have 2 wonder what I'm having 4 dinner everynite.     ;' (

Mos def one of the better korean restaurants in town.  I've frequented the OG one in Glendale since i was quite younger.  I'm glad they're doin well enough to even expand to Litchfield!    Always had great service here too.  Can't say I would know anything about the sushi though.....   oh well.  I'm always satiated with the K-food.

the Bento boxes are awesome, as well as the cheap sushi. the yakiniku is by far my fav, next to the Spam onigiri.  : D

the whole dinner thing took about 2 hours........ so come with patience. when i went, i think on a tuesday nite, a gentleman was playing some jazzy songs.  in fact, i think he was singing too!  the salad was pretty simple but tasty.  my plate was delicious.  grilled berkshire pork tenderloin w/red wine sauce and fingerling potatoes and apples.  mmmmMMMm black pig....... the way it's supposed to be....... xtra fatty delish marbling!  the goat cheese cheesecake.......... makes me wanna sing that jenny craig song....... u know..... the one that goes "yummy yummy yummy i got love in my tummy"  well..... i think it's the jenny craig song........  i understand about the bathroom thing.  it's kinda like intruding on someone's dinner space.  i just hoped that they couldn't hear me peeing.....

neh.  nothing special 2 me.  they have a good beer selection and many different pasties.  that's about it.  not so awesome service, and i was told that the waitress was their regular waitress, hilarious.    if u like stuff wrapped in pie dough and baked, go 4 it.  this stuff is too dry 4 me, but i do know sum people who like comin here 2 drink their huge cups of beer and eat pasties (that prob only taste decent cuz they're gettin tipsy).

hrm......... tortas........   so i'd been hearin bits n pieces about this torta place in central phx.....   one day.... hungry me and david decides 2 check it out....... he wuz pretty happy they had a vegetarian torta...... and i gots me the Cubano.  (milanesa is like fried heaven)  they're pretty good, but not as good as Los Reyes de la Torta (formerly Torta La Pressa, the OG one on 7th st. and dunlap)  i'm still curious as to the other mexican food offerings besides the torta.   o yea..... and i'd like 2 also mention, their fresh juices r tasty!!

So i've never been here before and wanted to try the sushi.  i got an Omakase deluxe sushi combination, which was one of Kabuki's recommended dishes.  It wuz NOT VERY GOOD!  The spicy tuna roll was extremely sloppy and the fish was not very fresh in any way, shape, or smell.  The next day I ate at Pacific Seafood Buffet and the fish was better there.... and lunch buffet is only $8.39 or so.  I used the yellowtail nigiri from there to compare the fish and I wanna say that the buffet's fish was actually more palatable.   If  that's the fish they're serving, the prices really need to reflect the quality.  This is one of those places that you should probaly only get the rolls at because the sauces and other crap cover up the actual taste of the fish.    I will admit their hot food is pretty good... I'd give that 4 stars...  and it seems they have a very extensive cocktail, sake, and shochu menu.  The service was good, even though we had a 2 year old eating rice and miso with his bare hands (thus throwing rice grains all over the place).  Summary: 1. crappy nigiri and sashimi 2. decent hot foods 3. good service for families
