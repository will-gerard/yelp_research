Hired these guys to fix my Rinnai tankless water heater.  After some shipping mishaps from Rinnai, themselves, Larry from Armor came out on a Saturday (his day off) to take care of us and get us some hot water which we hadn't had in a week.  Great guys, Dan, the owner, is a very nice guy.  I would highly recommend this company.

I read the reviews on both google and yelp before coming here.  The moment I walked into the building I was curious how they were going to take to me and my Labrador.  Our vets in the city of Maricopa are really the worst and we had less than satisfactory service with them so I was guarded.  However, there is something about this place that is just so warm and inviting and you can feel it.    I've been to other vets who acted like they cared - some even had this accusational attitude toward me when it came to helping me dog (yes, those vets in Maricopa); like I was neglecting him.  Country side will forever be my vet.  The staff was so friendly and really did care.  They provided me with the best options.  Now, I'm driving all the way from Maricopa because it's worth it.  If I could give them more than 5 stars I would.

We were taken in by the friendly service...*ahem* lip service...  Welp, we were from out of town, and in a bad situation.  About 4 hours from Las Vegas and in the middle of the desert we discovered our van was losing power. Luckily, taking it slowly we made it to Las Vegas.  I don't believe in putting a bunch of useless editorial, nasty comments, so I'm sticking to the facts.  Our was the car was losing power and spitting out some error codes which resulted in Fletcher Jones properly diagnosing and fixing the Issue.  Kudos on that part.  Apparently the issue stemmed from a computer within the van misreading what was cupping on the tires into thinking the pistons were misfiring.    All four tires replaced, tires balanced and rotated and before even stepping foot into a casino we blew 650 bucks.  What a way to start your three day vacation in Vegas.  Well, I took the car to a reputable shop, RC2Automotive.com when we got back to our home town and they told me the tires weren't even balanced.  Yet we were charged big time for it.  They brought me back into the shop and showed me -- said this happens a lot from dealers.  I would say, be aware of all dealerships, because this isn't the first one that I've had this happen.  However, I can say it will be the last.  I've found a more honest shop that deals less in the almighty dollar and more on honesty and ethics. At the end of the day one star is speaks volumes about how I rate honesty.  All I ask is ready my review, and make your own decision.

The staff was very at tentative toward us and our children.  We had to go after hours and actually had a very pleasant experience.   I would certainly recommend this urgent care for your child.

One of the best buffet I have ever been to in my life. Those that give this place a two star or one star really need to explain what other buffet they've been to in their past that better.  Ya the line is long but just like others say: the wait was worth it.  I've been here three times now and it's never a let down

Closes without notice.  Meh, I'll  just go somewhere else more reliable.

I prefer this place to Tacos N More because they are actually open when they say they are plus their food is OUTSTANDING. Try the Carne asada burrito, fully loaded.  Place is always super clean and super fresh ingredients.

The cool thing about this place is they actually can make a really good cup of coiffed no matter how you like it. Love that Maricopa has a great coffee joint like this. Seven cups was laughable in comparison.

Everything I have ever eaten here has been great. I would consider this place one of the only upscale areas of Maricopa thanks largely in part to the cities red rape.  I'd be nice to have other places like this.  Also the staff has always been really nice. I have zero complaints!

One of the great things I love about this company is that they don't harass you like those smaller operations do.  "Oh you offer a week cruise to the Bahamas which will never ever work with my schedule... No thanks keep your cruise I'll stay with safelite" They were very professional, arrived on time, and were very nice.  This is the second time we have used them and we won't use any one else; sorry to the other companies-- your gimmicks and continual harassment has run its course.

We hired this company to build a patio and acid stain it.  It took months because we discovered this business was a part time hobby of the owner whom had another full time job; ergo he could only come out at night and do what little work he could before it got dark making a relatively simple project span months.  Nothing ever got done unless we called them to come out and continue the job and even then they would often times not even come out when they agreed to.  I can't imagine my expectations are so high-- maybe that's normal in this business?  We then discovered they sprayed stain all over the side of our home and then refused to clean it while blocking our requests on Facebook and ignoring weeks of phone calls and emails.   This leaves us to buy paint and fix it ourselves.  Guys just stay clear of this business. It's just not worth it.

My wife and I never get out due to kids. So, when we do we expect standard service from our server.  Rarely do I get what I would consider standard service and trust me when I say my expectations are not that high.   This mellow mushroom exceeded our  expectations, specifically a server named Tamara.  This girl was constantly checking in on is to ensure our drinks were always filled and we were ok.  I can't even recall a time in the past that I was treated like this.   It was refreshing to actually be waited on knowing you don't have to go flag your server down.  She is setting the standard and the service at this mellow mushroom (because we've been to a couple)  should be an example to other mellow mushrooms.
