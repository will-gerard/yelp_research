Chopped salads are simply amazing! It's my absolute favorite lunch spot! Only reason I knocked one star is because of customer service, however it has been improving! I highly recommend this spot!

I am not a vegetarian but my cousin is so I took her here. I was a little hesitant at first but the food here is delicious! I got the BFF, which was messy but delicious, and she got a rice bowl which was also amazing. Cute little place that has a hippie chic feel to it!

Never had shaved snow before, but it's incredible! It's almost like frozen cotton candy, I got fruit with mine! Small, clean little shop and the lady working found my friend and I very amusing with our excitement over the shaved snow. Great cool snack for a HOT day!

I had really high hopes for this office, I was referred here by a coworker who spoke very highly of it. However, as a lot of these other reviews have mentioned, they are terrible at answering their phones, their customer service is not good, and they always run late.   I went in three separate times hoping that I would get good results, but each time I was called back 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment time in addition to having to wait another 15-20 minutes for the doctor to actually see me.   The doctor I saw is very sweet and caring, however the level of care that she gave me I was not satisfied with resulting in several follow up appointments to treat something that should have been taken care of with only one visit. Needless to say I am very disappointed.
