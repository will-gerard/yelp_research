Got here late and computers were down. Spent about 45 minutes getting checked in and we were all quite tired. Room was extremely nice, bed was comfortable, no complaints within their control. The screaming kid in the room next to me at 12am, well that is another story. All in all I would definitely stay here again.

Cheap parking, got me to the airport quickly. I have not yet picked up my car, but I do not foresee any issues as the place looks to be well secured.

I try to always stay at La Quinta when on business trips. Price is great, suites for the cost of standard rooms in other approved hotels. Since these are independently owned they are not always the same quality. This location is one of the best. Staff is nice, rooms are nice, and it is in a good location.

It's easier to count the things right than wrong with this place. 'Free' birthday brownie cost $5 on the bill, waitresses response was 'sorry' as she walked away. Food tastes as if it has been sitting all day then microwaved. The taste in my mind was this, think of a catered lunch at work and you miss out when it is initially served. Go back a few hours later, pick up a few soggy pieces of chicken parm and throw them into the microwave. Presto, you have our experience tonight. Portions are good, but good portions of crap is still crap. After coming here for my wife's birthday and us all leaving feeling less than satisfied I will not be back here, and would not recommend this place to anyone. For less than half the $100 bill we could have went to Olive Garden and had better food with less of a headache.

You people giving one star reviews for the pizza, are you kidding? This place is not for you, it is for YOUR KIDS.... The pizza is dry, the prizes are terrible, the price is high, its a great Chuck E Cheese's. We come here often for play dates with families in our group and always leave happy.

Was here for a corporate meeting, it was definitely meh. I would not expect to see cracks and water damage to drywall in a Hilton, especially starting at $160 a night. Cannot comment on the rooms, but the common areas were not all that nice. The bar and atrium was chill, and that is where I spent most of my time, hence the 4/5 rating. Had this area not been as nice as it was it would have been a 2.

I went to AJI again this afternoon to give another chance after reading the (flagged) reply from the owner of AJI. It was quite a different experience than the previous times I was there. While looking over some tactical stocks and foregrips or my Remington 870 I was greeted by two separate employees who offered info on the two stocks I was looking at. When I asked them how difficult they were to install they informed me that the gunsmith in the store would install them for me free with the purchase if I have the shotgun with me. Sadly, I did not, but I will be going back tomorrow with the shotgun to take them up on the offer. I hope that they will make good on the word, I would love to do business closer to home.

This state park is fantastic. The views are great, the staff is great, the cost per night is great. I have not a single complaint. We stayed a few nights on site 19. We awoke every morning to more quail than you could ever possibly count. Our daughter was in heaven watching them run around. One of the nights we heard some coyotes coming through the sites which was pretty cool. This is very close to our home so we will be staying many more times to come. If you are close you should really come and check it out!

Okay, this is hard for me, but the service this time was bad enough to warrant this. I have always been a fan of Big Wa. I have been eating here for five years, perhaps a bit longer. Today may keep me from going back. The food was great, always is, service was TERRIBLE. The server rushed us out as if our business was not important. Before we were done eating he literally came to our table and said "Okay" and picked up our plates. To be fair, mine was empty, but my fiance and my 2 year old  daughters were not. That is totally unacceptable, and it is not like we were there for an extended period of time (around 20 minutes). To take my 2 year olds lunch without asking when we are spending $25 at your establishment is not acceptable.

After my dogs nueter at another vet, some swelling, and a receptionist telling me that basically my dog is going to die from internal bleeding I rushed to this office after a recommendation from a coworker. Dr Carr and his staff were incredible and eased my mind quickly. They took great care of me and my dog, and sent me on my way with the medicine I needed right from the office, no other stops necessary. My dog was fine as the staff had assured me over the phone. I will not take my dogs to another vet again, this office is far superior.

Randy back in the hitch install bay is great. After another shop torqued my hitch down to 120ft lbs (really?!?!?!) he was quick to get it right and ease my mind. Work was quick and efficient, I would highly recommend Randy and the team here for hitch installation and service to anyone. Great job guys!

We love Dr Steve!  --update 7/24/13--  In all the years we have been coming here we have not had a single issue, until they hired the new woman up front. I believe her name is Siri. Today took the cake, but before that a little back story. We have called for the 6mo appointment for Lily Mae for the past few weeks. Every day she answers and gives whatever excuse she can think of. Computers down, no appointments for two weeks, she is too busy right now, I have heard them all. Finally my wife gets us an appointment today at one two four zero, yes, one two four zero. Seriously, who gives the appointment time like that? Siri does, that is who. Then gives you an attitude and acts like your ignorant when you clarify. After making the appointment she asked what the appointment is for, and when she hears it is for a six month checkup (daughter is now seven months, took that long to get in) she gives my wife the third degree for getting her in late. Remember, we are only late because their have been "no appointments, computers down, I don't have time for this right now" for the past three weeks.   So, we get to the appointment thirty minutes early. Those with two or more kids know, its thirty minutes early or thirty minutes late, there is no happy medium. Check in and get things going. Siri (first time I have met her in person) informs me that my insurance is cancelled. I advise her that it is not cancelled, there has been an ongoing issue with my insurance and they had to remove and re-add Lily Mae as her birth date was incorrect in their systems. She gives me an attitude and tells me that I will have to pay the bill if the insurance company does not pay. I let her know, again, that they will pay the bill and I am already aware of the issue. Most would leave it at that, but not Siri. Oh no, she must seek the "truth"! About ten minutes later I hear her blurting out my insurance ID number. She was on the phone with my insurance company to verify my insurance before she would let us go in for our appointment. Unbelievable! So the insurance company, who has not yet been informed by my employer of the changes to the birth date (all of this transpired this week) tells her that Lily Mae is no longer on the plan (duh, I just told you all of this). She tells the agent "thanks, I knew there was something going on, we'll put a stop to this" and hangs up. Giving me a dirty look she calls me back up to tell me that the doctor cannot see me unless I pay for the visit. Game over, no more being nice. After giving her a piece of my mind another woman up front came out and I stopped addressing her. Within a few seconds of talking to this other woman she understood the situation and got us back on track. Siri was not having any of that and started her mouth back up, glaring, and LAUGHING at me.   At this point I was done speaking with her and informed them I would be leaving their office and would not return. As I was getting the girls things packed up and watching as Siri sat in her chair watching us and smiling as if she just did something grand I chose to stay in spite of her. She is not an accurate reflection of this practice, everyone else is great. I jump on the phone with my benefits department at work and they confirm Lily Mae is insured within a few minutes. I have NEVER had a claim not go through at their office. My kids have both went there their entire lives. To treat someone that loyal like they are the scum of the earth is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. To call a patient a liar that has been with your practice since the start and go as far as calling in benefits for a wellness checkup is far beyond excusable. My advice to Dr Gentile and the rest of the staff, get rid of this CANCER before you lose more patients. If she is here with this attitude when I come back for our nine month checkup, we will not be back.  Now, to be fair, the star rating is down based solely on this person. Without her, this office is still a five star. With her here, the positives do not outweigh the negative she creates. Dr Steve and the rest of the staff were quite apologetic for her actions, but they should never have to be put in such a position. She has no business in the position she is in, she needs to be tucked away in a cubicle somewhere handling TPS reports and speaking to no clients of whatever business she is working for.

I expected a lot coming in here. Real NY attitude, RC Cola in a can, pizza looked amazing. For some odd reason I ordered chicken parm. Odder still, it came out on bread rather than pasta. I decided to take it to go and grab a Yoohoo on the way out, the cashier edited my ticket to include a $5 tip rather than ringing it out, thus messing up my expense report. Upon getting back to the hotel I was eager to tear into my food, which was terrible. Thrown into the trash, nothing good about it. They get 2 stars because the pizza looked amazing. I might give it a shot on my next trip for the pizza, but I do not know just yet.

I am sure our experience here was not as good as the employees were checked out, but this definitely did not hit the mark for what it is priced at. Doesn't matter anyway, this place is now permanently closed.

I worked with Mike Conway here and the sale could not have been easier. I started my search at Earnhardt RAM where I was less than impressed, but that is another review. A buddy of mine purchased his new 2500 here a few months ago. After reaching out to him after my experience at Earnhardt he passed along contact info for the GM of the dealership. A late night text to this contact followed by a phone call from Mike the next morning got the ball rolling. I am very specific with things I am looking for when it comes to the sales process. Doing sales for a living I do not want to negotiate. I understand the dealership must turn a profit, but there is a balance between the customer and the dealer. I found the truck I wanted on the Chapman site and provided Mike with the stock number and the deal was underway. We worked the deal on my new Cummins 4x4. Mike provided insight on the rebates off MSRP using Chrysler Capital's financing versus the rebates if I provide my own. No negotiations needed, Mike provided great pricing the FIRST time with no need for negotiation. We were on the phone and I checked his offer versus various other dealers and TrueCar as he was making it.  While I could save a lot more as far as rebates using my own financing, the 0% financing offer from Chrysler negated any additional rebates taken (Earnhardt salesman said that the dealer retains ALL rebates if I chose 0% so I would be buying the truck at MSRP, this was not the case, but again that is another review). I sent over all of my info for my trade in as well as the trade in offer from a competing dealership that I do a lot of work with. Within the hour we had agreed on the trade in value of my truck (within $500 of the dealer that I normally work with and purchased six vehicles from in the past few years, and on the FIRST OFFER). Mike stated that we can probably get more in trade after they look at my truck, but I did not even ask about it at delivery as I got what I wanted for my truck and was happy with the pricing on the new one. I would say I spent around 30 minutes TOTAL on this process. I was working and wanted to get the deal done before someone bought my new truck, issue was that I worked until closing time of the dealership. Mike stayed after hours to meet me and had us in and out in 23 minutes, no joke, we set a timer on my iPhone at his request. My time is valuable, Mike made it feel as if it was and made this a painless experience. A few items slipped under the radar before we took delivery, but Mike and Scott have promised to take care of them (a couple scuffs and a dent, nothing major so I felt I should clarify). I will update after these items are taken care of, but as it stands these guys are a perfect 5 star. You really do not find service like this much anymore with the domestic dealerships. I HIGHLY recommend dealing with Mike, Scott, and everyone else at Chapman.

The hotel itself may be nice, but the "service" I received from Tim at the front "sea bar" jaded me from returning to this place. After throwing $100 into the video slot at the bar he approached us for drinks. We ordered two vodka and cranberries. To my surprise, he came back with a bill for $20. No problem, we will just blow the money  and head back to the casino floor. I noticed that the drinks were unusually dark and upon tasting I found little to no vodka. Isn't the point to Vegas to liquor you up so you dump more money into the games?!?! Guess this guy missed Vegas 101. I told him that the drinks were way to weak, to which he replied "I already put a fucking double shot in there" and yanked the drinks from us. He went and actually poured two doubles while staring at us, dumped them into a new drink and slammed them in front of us. Even though he was being a complete jerk, I threw down $6 for his tip. As the money landed on the counter he SLAMMED a shot glass in front of me with a receipt in it for me to sign ($0 total, I suppose he was doing it for effect). I hit cash out on the machine, picked up the $6 tip, and got the hell out of there. I will probably not go back to the Excalibur based on this. I would recommend walking down to New York New York. Much better service, and no "Tims" working at the bar.

Stayed here on a weekend for work. The tower suites are fantastic. Killer view of the golf course. The best beds I have ever slept on, hands down. You can buy them for around $3000, worth every penny. This is pretty far from where we like to be on the strip (New York, New York is our spot to gamble) but it was worth the walk. Lobbies are all fantastic, rooms are super nice. When gambling on the floor we were drinking Grey Goose, not the cheap stuff that other casinos bring you. Only complaint I have is that the rooms facing the strip are loud almost all night. I know Vegas is loud, but for $250 a night on a corporate discounted rate I expect a certain level of quiet. We would stay here again if for nothing else the beds.

We did not stay in the hotel so this review is based off the Casino.  GREAT! We left Excalibur (see my review) and came here based on the recommendation of a buddy. Fantastic recommendation. Within five minutes of sitting down on the slots the drinks started flowing. I got fairly drunk and dumped quite a bit of money into the slot machines here. Funny how that works isn't it?  There were half naked dancing women behind the poker tables, great way for the house to win LOL. All in all, we will definitely be back, and may never wonder anywhere else on the strip. New York-New York is about the best we found in our walk of the strip.

We did not stay in the hotel, so this review is based off the Casino floor.   Lots of cigarette smoke, I know its Vegas, but at our hotel (Aria) they seemed to do  a lot to keep the smell down. Luxor did not. Overall it was a decent experience on the casino floor, but not a single drink in an hour and a half there. Would I go again? Probably. Would I expect much, not at all.

One word for this place, EPIC!  My (now) wife and I have been together ten years (to which Elvis said "well we really don't need to be here then do we" and laughed) but finally decided to legally tie the knot. We are not traditional and wanted to do something fun. An Elvis wedding was right up our alley. After doing some research on Elvis chapels we decided on Viva Las Vegas and jumped online to book.   From start to finish, VLV made the process easy. We worked with Olivia online who went over various options and made sure we had everything we needed. We went for the "Visions from the King" package. I can neither confirm nor deny that this package was chosen due to the Elvis glasses I received, especially deny.   Once arriving in Las Vegas we contacted VLV to provide hotel information. Our limo driver contacted us the morning of to provide our pickup time, and was not only on time, but early. The limo was nice, had complimentary water, and the driver was a good sport with our 3yo daughter who decided that this hour window of time was the best to have an epic meltdown (more on that later). All the staff at the chapel were amazingly accommodating, and also understanding of said 3yo's nuclear meltdown.   As awesome as Elvis was for us, once he arrived my daughter turned into an animal. This continued for the duration of the ceremony. This didn't stop the rest of our party, or the staff with VLV from having a good time. Our photographer did his best to get good shots, Elvis kept the singing and positive energy flowing, couldn't have had such an event at a "traditional" wedding and continued.   All in all, hindsight being 20/20, we would have probably had the ceremony first thing in the morning to avoid being anywhere within a few hours of nap time, we would have went back into the hotel for our 3yo's "blankie" which would have diffused the situation, but absolutely no changes would have been made from the VLV perspective. These guys are AMAZING and deserve every bit of the top chapel in Las Vegas name they have earned. We would not hesitate to recommend them, they made our day awesome and I'm confident they will make yours awesome too!

New owners, 'old recipe' (per the new owner), NOT the same. I will give this another go, but today I was thoroughly unimpressed. Guess I'll make the drive on down to Casanova Brothers again.  --thoughts after initial update to review--  Here is the thing. The place was a dirty, hole in the wall, REAL New York pizza joint with a just shy of rude owner (which is what you expect for the place). Walk in, "whaddayawant", throw some gigantic slices of cheese pizza in the oven and continue the phone conversation in some other language. Now it is cleaned up, big A frame sign with smilie face drawings that reads "Prima Pizza Bistro", and pizza made with cheap ingredients. People did not come here for a "bistro", we came here for some grease to your elbow NY pizza.  I have eaten here since the place opened, I will not be back.   For Yelpers looking for a good NY pizza joint, I no longer recommend this place.  Cruise on past and go to Casanova Brothers. They are better than Prima was before, far better than now. I am really sad to see this place change hands and change the quality. You should not change what is not broken.

We have purchased three new Toyota vehicles from this dealership this year. Mark Broughton was our salesman and he is great, I recommend asking to deal with him. Overall the dealership is squeaky clean, organized, and no high pressure sales. Brian, the owner of the dealership, is also quick to help where he can. We are customers for life.

I have been purchasing vehicles from Mark Broughton at Avondale Toyota for a few years now. Mark, and everyone else at Avondale Toyota for that matter, are extremely professional and not your typical car buying experience. Working in sales, I expect to be hassled and haggled any time I work with anyone else in sales. You simply do not have that problem here. There are no "key keeping" games (where your salesman keeps the keys to your trade in "hostage"), there is no price haggling, there is simply NO hassle. After purchasing the first vehicle from Mark at Avondale I knew that they had my business for life. Five vehicles later, they still have it. I have the confidence in the staff and in Mark to send all of my friends, family, colleagues, and customers of my own in to purchase their new vehicles. Living 380 miles round trip (yes, you read that right) and still making the trip to see Mark is a living testament to the service you can expect at Avondale Toyota. All of my immediate family now drive Toyota vehicles from Avondale Toyota, as well as most of my close friends. If you are looking for a new Toyota, or any used vehicle, you really owe it to yourself to check out Avondale Toyota. Ask for Mark Broughton, and buy from the only dealership you will want to give your business to.

Aside from breaking a lug stud making me late to get out of town on a road trip (pulling a camper, not willing to risk with a broken stud) these guys were great. Matched Tire Rack (less shipping costs), got my truck in and out quickly, and everyone was really nice. They did not, however, road force balance my tires so I had shaking in my steering at over 60. They quickly fixed the issue, but had my office not been close by I would not have been happy to spend time there twice for what should have been done the first time. I would have thought that with a 32" tire a road force balance would be a given. Overall, these guys get 5 stars from me. We all make mistakes, and they made up for them beautifully.

Best Pei Wei I go to. I order a weird meal, and they always get everything right. My fried rice has chicken, beef, and shrimp. Most other Pei Wei's charge extra for "extra protein" and there is far too much in the bowl. This one rings it up at the same price and splits the meat into thirds so you are not getting a bowl of meat. Service is always great, lines are long (because its good), we will keep on coming back again and again.

Stayed here on a business trip in a king bed high room. The room was super nice, made me feel right at home. If I am traveling in this area for work again I will certainly stay here again. One odd thing is that this hotel was louder than many that I have stayed in on the Vegas Strip, not really sure how that works, but it is. That is the only complaint I have, and its a stretch.

Would be a five star, but the ambience is all wrong here. In other Benihanas I have been to the lighting has been much lower. Here we kind of felt as if we were in a spot light all night (hibachi tables). Our server was great, our hibachi cook was very entertaining, and they made our five year anniversary one to remember. For that, we will be back, but turn down the dang lights!

If I could give negative stars, I would. But it isn't necessary. Overpriced "BBQ", small portions, terrible tasting food, and lack of service already drug this place into the ground. Don't waste the drive, this place is closed, and I wouldn't expect to see it relocate any time soon. If you really want to have the worst BBQ imaginable, look at their website and find another of their locations before they too close their doors.

This place rocks! I started eating much healthier earlier this year and Sprouts has been a key to sticking with it. Fresh fruits and veggies, AWESOME sandwich deal in the deli, happy and knowledgeable employees. The only negative is how many snow birds crowd this place out in the winter. I do not know why they cannot follow instructions and write down the sku numbers for their bulk items, or why they deem it necessary to sit drinking coffee in the deli for hours so there is no room for those actually eating the deli lunches to sit, but that is neither here nor there. I love Sprouts!

If you give this place anything less than a four star for a cheap pizza place, you really need to do some thinking here. It is a five dollar pizza. You can get this, or Little Caesars, you choose. Some people need an adjustment to their standards for what they are getting.

This place makes you feel like family. Tony brought out our pizza and some garlic knots that were on the house for our first visit and a handshake. Find me another place local that the owner greets their customers with a handshake and I will gladly go. The pizza, there is not enough room to describe it. It is the best in AZ, period. Garlic knots, superb. Prices, way too low for what you get. They are well worth our commute from Queen Creek.

This place is ridiculously awesome. We have been coming here for awhile and never had a bad meal or bad service. Cheaper than nasty chain mexican food, and 50x better tasting. If you are in the area you need to stop here. I recommend a few of the bean tostadas, they can't be beat!

This is really hard for me. Really, really hard.   I have been eating here since the place opened, have loved it. Recently, things have been changing. Ingredients, prices, items on the menu. Food has gotten bland, expensive, and on this last trip has made me sick for going on five days now. I do not believe that the kitchen staff is handling meats the correct way, thus giving me food poisoning.   Jims, if you are reading this, STOP! You guys were AWESOME. Go back to quality ingredients not crap we can buy in the frozen section at Frys. Stop changing the menu. Stop increasing your prices while decreasing your costs by using cheap ingredients. Have some pride in your work again. Bacon is supposed to be crispy and fried, not limp and tasting like it came from a microwave. I will not even comment on the burrito that made me sick because it will just put me back in the bathroom. When something is good, don't change it. I cannot tell you I will be back here again, food poisoning is not something I an inclined to risk again. I would sure hate to see the place close down, but you make your other regulars sick, they likely won't be coming back either.

If you are buying a Toyota, head on up to Avondale Toyota. The service at this dealership was sub par in the service and parts department (which is the only interaction I have had). I was not impressed, I will stick with the long drive out to I10 and 99th and have stellar service no matter what I am in for.

Came here on a business trip, its a tough life. This hotel is FANTASTIC. NO smoke smell on the casino floor, the room was incredibly nice, the service was nothing short of phenomenal. We did not spend much time on the casino floor here as we wanted to head out and see more of the strip.   We had dinner up on the promenade in one of the conference rooms with our party from work. The food was great. I cannot say I have had better prime rib on the strip. We will definitely be back to stay here again in the near future.

I did a ton of researching before choosing a buffet on this trip. Last trip the buffet was terrible, I did not want a repeat. Studio B was not a repeat of the bad buffet experience. The buffet was HUGE, tons of great food, service was excellent from the time we started checking in to the time we left. We will be back on our next visit.

I came here with no intent of buying a mattress, just lay on a few. Faith was a huge help and wound up selling me one. Got a killer deal, and same day delivery. If you are looking for a mattress, come see Faith!  --update--  Delivery guys were on time, quick, and even set up the frame so we were ready to go. To my surprise I found my frame and the mattress protector for half price on the Mattress Firm website. I would think that the website and stores would be in sync, but they aren't. I will be going back to see if they can make good on that tomorrow, I do not foresee an issue but if there is I will surely update. Called around to a few other mattress stores and I got my mattress and box springs for around $600 less than everywhere I called quoted on the phone. I feel I got a great deal on that part, just not stoked about the $150 extra cost in the add ons.   I am out of here, time to go get a good nights sleep on my new Stearns and Foster!  --update 2--  Manager promised to credit the difference in cost on the add ons. After calling a couple days I felt that he was avoiding me as he kept giving me excuses of how busy they are. On the fifth or sixth day I went in as it is harder to avoid someone face to face. He seemed to be avoiding again, but I got him to give me a dollar amount to be credited. He said it was posted on the second day after purchase but may take two weeks. When I checked my account the following week it was there and sure enough was sent on the second day after purchase but took a few days to clear. I am unsure why he was acting so dodgy when he had already posted it. Point is, they keep their five stars. I would not hesitate to deal with them again in the future.

After multiple times coming here crossing my fingers for help, today Jim came through. After a few minutes he had me sized for some new Ariat boots and a new MHT hat. He did not pressure me, was very knowledgeable and kind, and understanding about my three year old daughter trying on every hat and boot in her reach. I found the boots and hat I bought online for $75 less than I paid here, but it is all about the service. I do not mind paying more to deal with a person that gives honest answers and takes the time to get to know the customer they are dealing with. I left here feeling happy and $350 lighter. If you are here and see Jim walking around, take the time to talk to him a moment and see what he has to say.

This company is the worst. They send coupons all the time. We try them online and they work for the products selected. We go to the store (to keep the damn thing open and people in their jobs, online is feeding the unemployment in the country) and the cashiers always make an excuse why the coupons will not work. It is ridiculous. If it works online, it works in the store just the same, you're just being lazy.

Pretty nice hotel and casino. I got a great rate on the room. Only complaint is the beds are not all that comfortable and there was no toothpaste in the room. Seeing as I sleep on a Tempurpedic at home the bed thing is expected, but having to make a rush into town for toothpaste wasn't. I will be back in the area next month and I will likely stay here again.

Okay, I have been an Android guy for YEARS. I have worked for Verizon for ten years and sold against the iPhone for the bulk of that time. About 6 months ago I made the swap over to Apple and have not looked back. Visits to their stores always tend to get me spending money. Accessories stacked to the ceiling, nonstop flow of non pushy sales people that (for the most part) are always helpful. This place is pretty awesome.

If I could give negative stars I would. This place sucks. We have eaten here a few times and the service has always been subpar, but this trip takes the cake. We left after 15 minutes standing in line while the only two employees on the floor were making passes at the Pepsi vendor working on the soda fountain. We will not be back to this location, I would rather make the trip to Gilbert were their food is actually fresh and the service isn't terrible.

Good prices, fresh produce, and normally low gas prices. When the carts are put away its not a bad place to shop. Seems lately like they have let some cart attendants go, the place is a maze of carts. Probably be better if lazy people would put their carts in the corrals, but people are lazy. Those extra few feet of walking to put the carts away would probably help our obesity rates here in the US, but, I digress.

This review is for the company in general and for the guys that work the donations area. I cannot speak for anyone on the floor as I have never been inside.   Employees are helpful, the company does a great thing for the community. Donations employees are always helpful in unloading boxes and bags. We come through here to drop items off about once a month and never had a bad experience. I used to drop my items at another local Goodwill and the experience was quite different so I drive about ten miles more to come here.

Worked with Ron here. Quite knowledgeable about different mattresses, and more importantly he LISTENED to our sleep style and offered accordingly rather than just let us lay on everything. Went in "not buying anything" left with a wallet $3000 lighter. Cannot wait to get our new Tempurpedic tomorrow and get back to sleeping good after another mattress store stuck us into a mattress that is far too soft.

If I could give zero stars I would. This restaurant is by far the least efficient fast food restaurant in the area. Unfortunately for me my fiance loves their burgers. Spent 15 minutes in their drive thru last night with only ONE car in front of me (who had already ordered and was sitting at the window when we got there) before leaving without any food. This place sucks, everytime we come here they are slow but this was beyond understandable.

We have eaten here for years, and man has this place went downhill.   First, to start with what seals the deal, the woman "serving" us was TERRIBLE. She actually put a piece of pizza fresh out of the oven in front of my three year old daughter. Before I could move it the hands went in, and my daughter was burned. Rather than being caring, apologetic, or anything else she could have been she chose to roll her eyes and walk away as my daughter screamed hysterically. I touched the pizza myself and it was way to hot to have served period, much less sat in front of a toddler.   The pizza, man has it changed. It tastes as if it has sat out all day. Odds are it has, so no surprise. My wife got two slices of veggie pizza, and to my surprise there is now (maybe always been there just not charged, who knows) a 55 cent PER TOPPING PER SLICE charge. Her two slices were almost $15 by herself! Sure, it is on the menu as such, but what other pizza joint goes to the literal number of toppings on a specialty pizza?   Needless to say, we will not be back. The lack of common sense and sympathy by the waitress alone would have sealed that deal, the pizza tasting like a cheap take and bake was just icing on the cake. Don't be fooled by the 4 stars this place has, they have really gone to isht....

Decent location, and super cheap tax rate. I tend to favor this location over Rittenhouse for big ticket purchases to save on tax, and put the money into Pinal County rather than Maricopa. Employees seem less than knowledgable in most departments, but come on, its Walmart, if you need that much help shopping there then you have a personal issue LOL.

The one time I have dealt with this company I was not impressed. The girl up front was nice (Jessica was her name I believe) but seemed to be way over her work load. She was the only one answering phones, trying to get the order I was there to pick up for my wife, and juggling other paperwork. If it were not for her busting her butt like she was, this would be a one star. Quite a pity as a few in my immediate family work for this company, I wanted to give this a better review.  --edit--  There is a new Jessica up front, but this one is my wife (the family member previously mentioned). Just thought it necessary to add as they both have the same name.

Awesome pizza, awesome atmosphere, great prices. This would be a five star if they would figure out when their specials are. I call in to find out because I forget when the 6.99 large pizza is and I am always told "not tonight". A couple of times we have went in anyway and sure enough they 6.99 large pizza was the first thing offered. All the employees should probably be on the same page with this as they are probably losing walk ins from the lack of communication. Outside of that, we will be back again and again and again.

Been going to Saba's for years. Ran across a Boot Barn on a camping trip in Colorado and was super impressed with them. When we got home I looked for one here and was surprised to find one within 40 miles of my house. Headed out for the first time today and found their prices to be WELL below the prices at Saba's. I purchased an MHT hat for $39.99 here that sells for $79.99 (no, sadly, I am not kidding) at Saba's. This price was not a sale, it was the same price at the Boot Barn in Durango, they just did not have my size. The man working the counter was quite friendly and knowledgeable. Sadly, for Saba's, this Boot Barn location has earned my future business.

I eat breakfast here at least once a week, and they mess my order up at least once a week. It gets old to have your hot coffee so cold that you can drink it like a soda, no bacon on a bacon sandwich, items completely missing or incorrect items given. If there were a Wendy's closer, this one would be out of business. The staff here should be retrained or fired, but judging by the fact that the manager is the one working the drive thru every morning messing up the orders, perhaps its the later.

Aside from things that Sea Life Aquarium cannot control (strollers in the way, morbidly obese blocking exhibits talking while a crowd of children are trying to look at them, etc) the aquarium is awesome. My daughter and nephew had a blast. A ton of great exhibits, decently priced admission (currently $18 for adults), and a knowledgeable staff.   And for you out there expecting this to be some world class aquarium, get real. It is in a shopping mall, why would you expect it to be?   For what it is, its really great. I would recommend this to anyone with kids as something to kill a few hours.

Came here in the middle of the night fighting a kidney stone. The only negative I have is how long it took to get seen. I spent about 30 minutes to be seen, which is an eternity in the pain I was in. Outside of that, the staff was genuinely caring. I saw Dr Page and he was quite helpful in helping me understand what was going on and getting me medicated so I could start feeling better.

I was unsure about this place but decided to give it a try. Price was not bad, service was good, but holy crap were they busy. Took us thirty plus minutes to get seated, the place is tiny. I had the combo fajitas, no complaints. More than enough food, not stingy on the tortillas, and the taste was fantastic. I will give this a few more tries before I make a final review, as the majority of the reviewers have had inconsistent results here.

This place rocks! I started eating much healthier earlier this year and Sprouts has been a key to sticking with it. Fresh fruits and veggies, AWESOME sandwich deal in the deli, happy and knowledgeable employees. The only negative is how many snow birds crowd this place out in the winter. I do not know why they cannot follow instructions and write down the sku numbers for their bulk items, or why they deem it necessary to sit drinking coffee in the deli for hours so there is no room for those actually eating the deli lunches to sit, but that is neither here nor there. I love Sprouts!

Complimentary fried raviolis while we wait? Sure! From the moment we stepped into the front door it was as if we were family, and hey, thats their slogan. I would say they are making true on that promise. Food was awesome, our server was a bit odd (popped up out of nowhere and gone just as fast as if we were in some movie) but friendly, and the management staff made sure everything was good before we left. No complaints, and we will be back for sure.  A hint for you parents, there is a McDonalds that can be seen out of the windows. If your kids are anything like mine, try to steer clear of the windows (unless you want to hear about chicken nuggets and fries your entire meal LOL)

Great sandwiches, great staff, great prices. Why someone would go to a Subway or Quiznos in this area when there is an establishment this much better baffles my mind. The meats are phenomenal (Boars Head), the cheese is unbeatable, the bread is fresh, a few selections in teas (black sweetened, black, green sweetened, and raspberry), AWESOME brownies, and snack cakes only found back east. This place is great!

I have had Kyle install headrest monitors in my previous SUV, and now an overhead monitor in my current SUV. Service has been top notch on both occasions. I am a customer that asks a lot of questions and does a lot of homework, typically playing out multiple scenarios for what I am doing. Kyle had no problem answering all of my questions, and answering truthfully not just to make a quick buck. I would highly recommend Streamline Audio Video for any car audio installs.  Another great thing is that these guys are mobile, my headrest monitors were installed right in the parking lot at work!

A diamond in the rough. You cannot get any more manly than big trucks and off road equipment. This doesn't always equate to places that are good to shop. These guys LOVE off roading and the vehicles to do it in. This place is a one stop shop. From installing my weight distribution hitch to fully built long travel suspensions, they do it all. Best part about this place, you ask a question you get an answer that is true, not what you want to hear or what makes them more money. Cliff and Will have became the first out of my mouth to friends, family, and everyone I meet looking for parts, installs, and anything else 4x4 related. If you are in the area, swing on in. This place is an overlander's paradise!

Fresh meats, fresh cheeses, fresh bread, how can you go wrong? The employees here are phenomenal. Every time I am back in the valley I will be here.

Brian was extremely helpful in setting up HIDs in my new RAM 2500. Previous setup flickered and had issues, he informed me immediately that I needed a canbus setup to avoid issue. Price was fair, installed extremely fast, and a pretty good warranty on the equipment. I will definitely be back here for some trail lights and will be sending some buddies in for lighting as well. If you're looking for lighting of any kind, this is your spot!

Eat here at lunch quite often and never had a bad experience. Chipotle is pretty much the same at every location, and that is a big win for them. I will keep coming, and I know they will keep giving me great burritos.

Worked with Billy Hermann  here. I cannot type much as my forearm is freshly tattooed, but these guys kick ass. I will update later.

Huge selection of glass pipes and other smoking accessories. I am not a cigar smoker so I cannot comment on that, but this place isn't bad. Owner checked my ID twice, must have forgot, but at 30 I happily show my ID nowadays.

If you go to Coach at the mall you are going to pay 2-3x more than here. This place is my wife's new favorite. I am pretty happy to have found this place! Will save me a ton of money on my wife's purse habit!

Typical QT. Fresh, cheap fuel, and tons of junk food.

So glad that Circle K came to our area. I fill up here at least once a week. I am happy to see many others doing the same. The Chevron across the street has been raping us out here for years, so I am happy to give someone else my business.

Update -  First trip was a fluke, bad sandwich. I would say steer clear of the patty melt. We have eaten here a few times since and it has been stellar. The custard is out of this world, the kids meals come with a free custard which is a nice touch. I still like the burgers at In N Out better, but I have definitely eaten here quite a bit more than I have there in the past couple of months so that may change.

This is right next door to my urologists office. They got me in quick without an appointment for a STAT request from my doctor. While in the waiting room I got really apprehensive of this place drawing my blood from the previous reviews, I am kind of a baby about that type of stuff, but contrary to the reviews I had no issues.

This shop is great. I had them install a leveling kit and overload bags on my Tundra about six months ago. The service was great, was done quickly, and had no issues. This week I decided I would lift a bit higher. After a couple conversations with Mike I narrowed down the lift and we got it ordered. I got the call this morning that it was in and they got me right in. A few hours later I got a call that the truck was ready to go. Pulling into the parking lot I found my truck sideways in front of the shop as if on display which made me that much more excited. A slight misunderstanding had the differential drop removed, but George was quick to get it back on the lift and put back on even after closing time. There are not many shops around anymore that would do this at all, much less without having a lot of push back. These guys are great and have awesome prices on everything you will need to customize your truck, whatever your flavor. If you are looking to lift, level, lower, or just add some flare to your ride, look these guys up. You will be glad you did!

Okay, so my first thought was dang this place is arrogant. Only offering their sauce, no bbq, no ranch, etc. After a few bites I was floored. This place is epic! The chicken was amazing, the sauce with the chicken is unbelievable, the service was awesome. I will definitely be back, too bad its such a drive for me :/

I did not have good luck with sales here the first time around. Service on the other hand has so far been AMAZING. I have moved to northern AZ and was in town on a business trip when the ball joints went out on my RAM 2500. I brought it in right at close and The service department got me set up quickly with a rental car and got to work. After leaving I got a call that there were also various software updates that needed done and they wanted to be sure that I did not have custom software on my ECU before doing them and I lost an expensive tune. While I am sure this is also to make sure the truck has not been modified and I do not mess with my trucks tuning, I can appreciate the fact that they we're cognizant of the fact that some do tune and that a reflash could cost them a lot of time and money. We are looking for a 4x4 for my wife now that we have moved to snow country, we will make the trip back down here to make the purchase as with a service department this good my first experience here had to have been a fluke. I would highly recommend Earnhardt for your next purchase or to handle your service, it's quite obvious they care about their customers here.

Pizza is really good for what it is. Reminds me of Hungry Howies and Little Cesar's back when they were good. Butter Cheese crust was great. We will be back.

Came here battling my third kidney stone in two years. Have had my PCP and another doc tell me I have high blood calcium as if it is not a big deal. This has likely been a contributing factor to my stone production so I let Dr Shaba know. He quickly pointed out that high blood calcium is not normal and we need to address my parathyroid. I have brought this up to two other doctors now that have acted as if I am trying to do their job and not explored the situation any further. Dr Shaba called it on the first visit, as soon as I mentioned it. This tells me that his knowledge spans far beyond others in his field when it comes to my condition. If you have ever had a kidney stone pass you know how bad the pain is, Dr Shaba and his staff made it quick and easy for me not only in getting me through this stone, but taking strides to stopping them from forming. I highly recommend the staff at Southeast Valley Urology, especially Dr Shaba, for any of your needs in this field of medicine. You guys/gals are awesome!

Came here to get a gift for my wife. The ladies here were helpful, patient, and made the process easy. Why people pay this much for a purse I will never understand, but I am one of them so I guess that makes the question easy to answer. I, and my wallet, hope to not shop here again, but if I do at least I know I am going to get great service!

This place was a surprise to me, honestly. A coworker brought me here for lunch, and this is not at all my style of food. I ordered a gyro burger and hoped for the best. HOLY MOLY was I surprised! Absolutely amazing! I will definitely be back here when I am in the valley. My recommendation, get the gyro burger!

This place is pretty awesome. I am not this type of foodie, and being a good old red blooded 'merican I was kind of out of place in my cowboy hat and boots, but I enjoyed the experience. Will I come again, not likely, but it still earns a solid 4 stars.

All of the service on our Toyota is done here. Our service writer is Ken, and he is always on point. No complaints at all from this dealership.

Camping World is a big kid playground. While more expensive than online competitors, it is nice to have some brick and mortar. Employees are helpful, prices are good if you join President's Club.
