Took my friends little daughter here last Saturday for the Christmas lights and I didn't expect this place to be so crowded! I thought there would be more things to do but when I looked around it looked like it was the carousel and train ride to see the lights which you have to pay and get tickets for those rides. They also had a museum which you had to pay separate to get in.  It started at 6:30 PM and we got there around 6:15 PM and the line for the train was already SUPER LONG! We rode the carousel first since the line wasn't that bad and the little one seemed to enjoy it and it was actually fun for the adults too! They had Elmo, Cookie Monster, Tigger and Piglet characters hanging around so you can take pictures with them. They also have a little convenient store where you can get coffee or hot coca, ice cream and little snacks. Anyways we decided to go wait  in line for the train ride and we were walking over towards the line and the line got even LONGER!  It went all the way towards the parking lot (APPROX. wait time 1 hour and 45 min.) I felt like I was in Disneyland waiting for rides, the wait was so longggggg and it was cold, but we were all just telling ourselves it's not for us it's for the little one so she can enjoy it! We were talking to a few parents that were in line and they said they come every year just for the train ride and last year they waited around 2 hours but they said it was worth it for the kids. The train ride was probably the best attraction that they had there, it was about 10 min. long and it was enjoyable (Better than that lame drive through Christmas lights I went to last year in Phoenix). This place had lots of lights and cute little characters, they even had Frozen which was cool since that's the big thing right now. They even had fake snow blowing in the air towards the end. My friends little daughter kept yelling out "Best day everrrrrrrrrrrr!" so I guess she had fun LOL. I don't think I would go to this every year and wait in line for almost 2 hours but it's definitely a place you should come with your kids at least once.

I've been on a "vet" hunt for awhile now and been to a couple of places around the area but they did not please me until I came across this place! The doctors here actually "LISTEN" and "EXPLAIN" just about everything so that you understand what's going on with your pet. And this makes me feel so much better and at ease knowing the fact that they actually take their precious time with each patient because to me that shows me that they actually care about their patients and the well being of our pets! All the staff members here are nice and very informative and they will treat your pet like their own and that's what I love about this place.  They get a 5 star =)

So my friend from Tucson said when she's in PHX she always likes to stop by at this restaurant called Bandera. She told me how good it was so I went on Yelp to do some research because I haven't heard of this place, which to me was shocking. I'm not sure how I missed this place because it's right in Old town where all the restaurants are at. O_o  So what grabbed my attention from the pictures on yelp was their Cornbread... let me just say that I LOVE good cornbread...Bandera serves their cornbread on a skillet, it came out right out of the oven, hot, fresh, crisp, and my golly it so good! (Yes, I said "Golly" lol...)  I could  taste the corn and jalapenos all together in my first bite. If anyone has tried ZTeja's skillet style cornbread, Bandera has got it in the bag! I just wanted to eat that as my main entree...it was that good...!)  I got the Prime Sirloin Tri-Tip and Enchilada Platter with cucumber salad (this seemed the be the popular choice on yelp). The portion was good, although it was plenty it wasn't too small or gigantic. Everything went well together, the sirloin was cooked to medium rare, the enchilada was delicious with the perfect amount of their special enchilada sauce that was drizzled on top, and their cucumber salad was refreshing! My bf got the Aged Prime Rib which is slow roasted on the bone with mashed potatoes. He was surprised on how big the rib was, it was literally the size of his hand haha! It was just way too much meat for him, if you like a lot of meat then this dish is for you!   So everyone said that they were full and had no room for dessert but I insisted on getting something! It was either between Banana Cream Pie or their homemade Oreo Cookie, they both looked so good but we choose the Banana Cream Pie with caramel and crushed chocolates to share and guess what...we all killed it!   I would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance was great, service was fantastic, food was good, check it out. =) I'll be back to try their Oreo Cookie Sandwich next time and of course their Cornbread.

Cute place to bring a date. Our waiter was awesome he had a thick Italian accent ..it was a bit hard to understand when he told us about the specials but I thought that was pretty cool because it just adds to the whole experience you know? He recommended the  Portobello anitpasta, the Linguini with shrimp (with lemon zest) so good!!  & I believe it was the Linguini with ham (forgot the name of it). Everything was excellent and very tasty.  Went here on a weekend and it was pretty packed so make sure you make reservations!

On our anniversary night we finally made our way out to Scottsdale just to give this place a try.   For an appetizer, we had the grilled artichoke with aioli sauce (which was recommended by the waitress, supposedly it's one of their popular appetizers). we've never tried a full artichoke before, but it was actually good..you could smell and taste the wood grill in the artichoke and it was even better with the aioli sauce. Just wish there was more to eat because towards the middle it was mainly just the leaves so there was not much to eat.   For dinner we had the Rotisserie chicken crepes with mashed potatoes topped with mushrooms!! lots of mushrooms!! and their signature gravy. This was truly amazing! Their gravy had such great flavoring that it made everything just taste so good!  (we couldn't finish it so we took it to go, heated it up the next day and it was still THAT good!)   We also had their Balsamic Ribeye with Israeli couscous. They could of used a bit more balsamic for their ribeye just to add a bit more flavor to it, but overall it was good, not bad.   and last but not least the white chocolate banana cream pie for dessert!!!!!!!!! I was mainly excited for this particular dessert and it was soooo yummy!!!! One of our favorite! and we wanted to order more and more and moreeeeeee! we would drive 45 min. just to go eat more of that banana cream pie!

My roommate has been telling me about this awesome place and their amazing Ahi Tuna Sandwich. She's been talking non stop about it so last weekend she decided to take me. I immediately liked the place because it was surrounded by so much green grass lol. It just had that different feel to it like your someplace else and not surrounded by the lame desert... So of course I had to try the Ahi Tuna Sandwich and instead of getting fries with it I substituted it with the beets salad and got myself the strawberry lemonade. At first I was a bit skeptical about the sandwich just cuz I don't like the idea of fish in my sandwich but all I gotta say is just WOW! The sandwich literally just melts in your mouth! and the wasabi mayo they used in it gives a little kick to the taste. Their bread is a bit glazed on top and it tasted so fresh like it was right out of the oven. Their beet salad with pecans and blue cheese was good too and their strawberry lemonade was great! I like the fact that there are REAL strawberry chunks in there and no artificial flavors.   I wanna try the fontina burger with sweet potatoes next! with a banana milkshake! MMM!

Ordered take out for this place for the first time just to try their food and the food was meh. We ordered: chicken tortilla soup, pot roast with fries, chicken pot pie (came with salad with ranch dressing, and peach cobbler.  When I went inside to go pick up the food my first impression was like whoa...it's so country in here..Decor is kind tacky. They have displays of their pies at the front and it looked like it's been sitting in there for days. I kinda almost wanted to tell  someone there to take our peach cobbler order out but by that time one of the servers came out with our food. Chicken pot pie was OK but nothing amazing. It's kinda like the ones you could get from the frozen section at Target or something. Pot roast was my least favorite...it had a weird flavor and taste to it and the veggies were hard! Also, the fries were really soggy. Salad was just salad, it was just chopped up lettuce, cucumbers and carrots....with ranch dressing...WHOO~! The peach cobbler was definitely a couple days old and not fresh. You can tell by just looking at it. Overall, the best thing I would say was the chicken tortilla soup but they forgot to give me tortilla chips ugh! I dunno about breakfast but dinner here is definetly not somewhere I would wanna go.

I was craving Greek food for some reason and decided to give this place a try since it was nearby home. We made it for happy hr so we ordered a bunch of things thinking that their portions would be small but we were wrong...it was like whoaa we ordered way too much! We got the  Spanakopita, Greek fries, Greek nachos, Falafel Mee Tahini that came with pita breads, & Hummus which also came with pita breads. Lots and lots of carbs!!! Mmmmmm! It was so filling! .The happy hour prices for these are well worth it. Greek fries or Nachos for like $4 bucks? Everything we ordered had feta cheese on top with big slices of tomatoes and everything was tasty. Especially with their Tzatziki sauce. Next time I stop by I want to try their Greek salad and something on their dinner menu.

This is the best Pho restaurant ever!  I've became a regular for months! And never gone to another Pho restaurant except this location.   The first thing that came to my mind about this place was how clean it was unlike most pho restaurants...and it's even in a nice location & it's affordable...not expensive at all.  I have tried almost everything on their menu except for the chinese food that they serve which is on the back of their menu. And everything is SOOOOOOO delicious! Most importantly their veggies are all fresh!!! YAY! I hate it when i go to some pho restaurants and they give me veggies that looks like its weeks old... do they really expect me to put that in my bowl of pho? NO THANKS!   Their service is fast & great! Staff is real nice and friendly. Since we became regulars they even know exactly what we want in our pho and how we like it.   Everyone should definitely go check this place out! if you like veggies like me try their chicken veggie pho with tofu! or #S2 if you like seafood.

We come here every Sundays after church for breakfast! it's one of our favorite breakfast spots ever! It's usually busy that day so I suggest you call and reserve if you don't want to wait.  This place is a cute little cafe, the staff is awesome, the food is great and you get pretty big portions for breakfast for a good price. My all time favorite would have to be the California Benny and my boyfriend always gets the Princess Omelette. My boyfriends dad is in love with their Country fried steak. He said it's better than Cracker Barrel's and I would have to agree on that.  We tried almost everything on their breakfast menu and I can't really think of a dish that I was disappointed in so I say go check this place out!

Everything I ordered from here was way too salty! I left the restaurant dehydrated and I found myself drinking loads and loads of water....Their miso soup was terrible...I felt like someone just added 5 cups of salt into that soup.Their sea weed salad was not even fresh...apparently it's been in the freezer and they didn't defrost it all the way so I could feel the little ice chunks and frozen bits of seaweed as I was chewing...just horrible! Ugh...

Love this place!!! Went there for lunch and George the owner made our Greek salad and Southwest Sandwhich. It was amazing!!! Even their ice tea was yummy!  When we were about done eating George came over to our table and asked us how the food was...and he was real friendly.  I would definitely go back there again and maybe see how their breakfast menu is like.

I always ask for Jade when I come here and she's great! The other staff members here are friendly as well and acknowledges you when you come in. I always ask for Jade though and I love talking to her while getting my nails done. I've been going to her for awhile now and she already knows the style, colors, & design I like. She does an excellent job every time I go visit her so I would definitely check her out! Make an appointment if you want to see her!

i gave this place about a couple tries only because it's close to home...Unfortunately I was quite disappointed each time. Every time I went in it seemed like the crowd was much older...I felt out of place but that didn't stop me from trying their food.   Their service was okay but sometimes it took forever. I think they are too focused on the older crowds then the younger crowds...? or maybe that's just how I felt the past couple of times I've been there. I know that they have an open salad bar and it's all you can eat per person if you order an entree. (Which I did not know and they did not go over) & just the last time I've been there I shared the salad with my bf and the waitress saw that and came up to our table and told me they will have to charge me for that which I thought she could of politely have told me after I ask for the check...not while I'm trying to enjoy my dinner....Couple min. later she brought out the wrong entree and didn't even apologize. In my head I was thinking to myself hmm...she better have that salad on the house since she messed up on the order. And guess what she did but yet she still didn't get an apology for that wrong order. lol....  I tried a couple of their entrees and honestly it's nothing special. Their pasta is good but how can you go wrong with pasta? Nothing really seemed to stand out for me to go back once more unless I felt like eating pasta & their bread.

I've came across this place on Yelp before and always wanted to give it a try...But I got lost somehow and couldn't find the location and just gave up lol. Well I  finally found Yoli's on Google maps one day and I guess I know why I missed it the first time because it's in a run down area of Chandler and the restaurant is actually an old house. I ordered the garden skillet with raisin bread toast and their famous Morning Monte Sandwich. Presentation wise, the food didn't look really presentable. There's a hype on Yelp of their Morning Monte and it's basically french toast with eggs and bacon (BTW the bacon looked like it's been left out all day, definitely not fresh). The garden skillet was OK but I had better breakfast skillet elsewhere. I just felt like something was missing. The service? Um...OK as well. Our food took forever and I was just sipping on my coffee...next thing I know I was sitting there with an empty coffee cup for about 10 minutes or so. I had really high expectations for this place because of the yelp reviews, but I was a bit disappointed and I honestly thought the food was comparable to IHop or Dennys IMO...

Finally a decent sushi restaurant near home! I went to their soft opening for dinner and as soon as I walked in I was actually pretty surprised on how nice & big it was, the decor, fine dinnerware, the whole setting. Whoever designed the place did a pretty good job. And I like how the bar is in the middle of the room and there are sections of places you could sit around the place. I noticed how some of the waitresses were wearing their fake Gucci pouches and staff members were using ipads. It seemed like a fancy sushi restaurant. I was just hoping it wasn't another one of those RA/Roka Akor like sushi restaurants. Their sushi is horrible!   Anyways got seated by some waitress and she freaken took forever to get our drinks, then moments later she came back with our appetizer which was the Otaku spicy tostada. This was good!!!! She even suggested to try their kitchen food instead of sushi so we did and I got the seafood tofu hotpot & boyfriend got the curry chicken. The curry was rather watery kinda like curry soup which was eh.The seafood hotpot on the other hand was actually pretty good with lots of flavor. Mine didn't come with rice so I was waiting on our waitress, but she was seriously missing the entire night! Thankfully my friend actually works there and she came to check up on us & I told her I needed rice she was brought it for me. Even one of the manager came over to our table and asked us how our food was. Overall, I had a good time, most of the staff was pretty friendly.  I understand that during that time since it was their soft opening some things were a bit unorganized but still the our waitress sucked. My friend even had to go look for her in the kitchen to let her know we were done and was ready for our check! GRR  I also went here for happy hour just yesterday and it seemed to be a bit more organized & in place. YAYYYY! =P Tried their tootzy roll, spicy tuna, & vege roll. It wasn't GREAT, but it was good. And service was good too. I say their kitchen food is probably a bit better than their sushi. But overall I like this place definitely would go back again.

I just recently discovered this place only because of Living Social and they had a deal going on. $50 ($100 value) for a three-hour BYOB painting class for two. Materials included are: 16x20 canvas, acrylic paints, brushes, and an apron for each student. You can go on their website and check their event calendar to see what the instructor will teach that day. Each week is a different theme and they show samples of the instructors artwork on the calendars to show you as well. I choose the "Tree of Love" theme since I was going with my bf and thought it be a cool experience for our first time. You have to make reservations online or by phone.   We got there pretty early and was greeted by the instructor and she had us sign in and then told us to pick a place to sit. We were talking to her briefly since we were early and she was so sweet. Once everyone was in we got started and she goes over everything step by step to make it real simple. During the class, she will make sure that everyone is at the same pace and then she will proceed with the next step. Her assistance was out that day so her husband was the assisting for the night and he was taking pictures and helping people out if it was needed. When she announced that I was like awww, that's too cute! Her and her hubby teaching her class together!   Since this was a BYOB painting class, it really made the class more enjoyable with your significance other or friends. It just makes the activity more exciting since you're a little tipsy. I noticed one lady that came in and she even brought a big huge icebox for her BYOB lol. Now that's SMART, I am going to steal her idea and do that next time so my drinks are cold and ready! =)  Overall, I enjoyed this fun little activity a lot. My bf liked it too and we want to go back. We loved how our painting turned out so we got it framed and now it's hanging in our room. It was a good date night, and I would definitely recommend this place.

One night after watching a movie at AMC, I whipped out my iPhone and launched my trusty Yelp app because I was craving some sushi. Lo and behold there was a spot right next to me! After reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a shot, even though one of the reviewers said Costco had better sushi, haha. Thankfully, some other Yelpers pointed out that it used to be an LnL so finding the joint was a snap.  The atmosphere upon entering was very welcoming. The hostess/waitress greeted us with a big smile and said we can sit where ever we liked. Like the other reviews here I have to agree the customer service was amazing. And the food was very fresh and excellent quality, beautifully plated and came out in a timely manner. If you're going here for your first time I recommend trying the "What the Heck?" roll. Oh and Costco? Really? Do they have a place where you can get your taste buds examined?  Since that day I have been back here multiple times. I have tried most of their entrees and sushi, and have yet to be disappointed. One thing that stood out to me over the countless other sushi spots around the valley is the Chicken Katsu Sandwich. I don't think there is another place that offers this unique dish. Chicken Katsu with lettuce, tomatoes, and mayo in-between slices of thick, soft Texas Toast? Yes, please! Oh and their complimentary Miso soup is one of the best I have ever had.   I believe this is a small family owned and operated business, and with today's economy I have to give them props for opening up. To all the people that like to support our Locals, this is a place you need to check out. Also, don't forget to check in on yelp to receive your free Tempura Ice Cream for dessert!

Love this Pet Club location! I recommend this place if you want high quality food for your pets. The staff is really friendly here and customer service is excellent. They really help you one on one with questions you might have and they know their stuff! They have been a great help for my little pups! :)

ok so I read the bad reviews on here but I still wanted to give this place a try since it's a new place for revloving sushi. Also, I wanted to compare and see if it was better than Teharu Sushi in Tempe.   Well I was not impressed at all...They really need more variety of sushi rolls! The whole time I was there I was just waiting and hoping to see if different rolls would be coming my way but NOPE it was the same california roll, salmon roll or vegas roll just rotating in circles! I don't want to be eating the same rolls over and over! So because of this...my friends and I ordered sushi off the menu. Each roll it took them more than 30-40 mins to make! And this place wasn't even packed! There were total of 3 sushi chefs in the kitchen making sushi too...ugh...I think I was at the restaurant for a good 2 and half hours...  The sushi itself was nothing special. I only liked one of their roll and I only saw that type of roll rotate around once...  Honestly I would not go back here ever again....If you want the whole "revolving sushi" experience go to Teharu Sushi... just sayin....

Wanted something quick and easy and found this place thanks to Yelp. My husband and I shared #20: thinly sliced turkey, crisp bacon, fresh avocado and tomatoes, shredded cheddar cheese, Zookz sweet heat mustard sauce. The sandwich comes with a side of your choice (kale salad, potato salad or garbanzo bean salad) and a drink. We picked the garbanzo as a side and pomegranate iced tea. The sandwich came out hot and toasty and the first bite I had was pretty tasty! They bake their bread in a special cylindrical pan so every bite had a lot of flavor and it was so crispy! I love cheesy crispy bread! Reminds of me grilled cheese sandwiches but better! The garbanzo beans was also a good choice! I choose this side because it was different. I've had many kale & potato salads before so thought giving garbanzo salad a try and it was very good. I actually want to try making this at home. The pomegranate ice tea was a refreshing choice and just what we needed since it was so HOT today! While we were eating, the owner also came up to us and asked us how everything was and was really sweet.  We really enjoyed everything we ordered here and definitely want to go back to try some of their other sandwiches especially their breakfast ones!

I remember when they first opened and I tried their Cobb Salad...I was not impressed for some reason. I'm not sure why... maybe because they just opened and it wasn't good before? A Couple months later,  I started to give this place another try and then another and then another....Then I found myself going here like every week! I tried most of their salads on their menu and I tried their kale/banana & strawberry/kale drink which was surprisingly really good. I must say that I am a big fan of this place now and on days where I don't want to cook but I want something healthy, this is the go to spot for me. I'm actually glad that this place opened because instead of fast food drive thru's there is now a salad on the go!  I'm a little bummed that they don't have their special anymore though...it was the butternut squash salad. That was my all time favorite but their special right now which is the kale caesar is also very tasty!  Their salads are fresh and for the price they give you a lot! Go check it out!

OK i did a review for this place when it was called Way Sushi and that place SUCKED. Now...this place is called RYU Sushi with new ownership and needless to say, my sushi experience there was one of the best I've had in the Gilbert area. I went with a few of my girlfriends for GNO (girls night out) night and I was so surprised on how tasty everything was and every single time I took a bite I was just like "WOW, this is so goodddd!"  Their specialty menu is what got to me. All of them seemed so creative and delish! The specialty rolls I ordered was the Boo Ya Ka Roll (My favorite), Surf & Turf, Chimichanga, Basil, and their Spicy Tuna Pokie Salad. Everything was fresh and thoughtfully made. The ingredients for some of their special sauces they used in some of their rolls were well balanced and made it flavorsome. Their sushi rolls are pretty big too so it's definitely worth what you're paying for. Oh, make sure to leave some room for dessert and try their Pizookie! Yes...I said Pizookie! I was surprised too when I heard this. My girls and I killed it and when I went there again the 2nd time I took my bf and ordered the Pizookie as well and we devoured the deliciousness.   Ryu, also has great happy hour drinks or specialty drinks! So that is also a plus! Their customer service was beyond superior. The lady owner there is super sweet and you could tell she really cares about her customers. She takes the time to talk to every table and makes sure you are enjoying your experience at Ryu. ( I love customer service like this)   By the end of the night after 3-4 hours. Our GNO night ended up to be a Food Coma night...LOL. We were so full but happy full =)  I highly recommend this place for sushi! I am planning to be a regular here not only b/c I want try everything they have on their menu but because they really truly do have great food. Go see for yourself. =P

I came here before heading to IKEA one day because we were so hungry and this was one of the places that was rated well on Yelp and was close by. I should have read the previous reviews before coming here because several people have mentioned that their food was salty. Well I didn't realize until only after I have ordered my food and sat down waiting, reading the reviews on their food thinking "oh great, our food is going to be salty!"  I ordered the chicken swarma plate with rice, salad, cilantro hummus and pita bread and my fiance ordered the gyro plate with rice, salad, pita chips and some other sauce (forgot the name). Well, I took a bite out of a small piece of chicken by itself and OMG that thing is loaded with salt! I tried a piece of gyro which was not as bad as the chicken but still it's pretty salty if you ask me. I had to make sure I was balancing it out with more hummus and salad when I was eating the salty chicken so it would be more tolerable. Everything else that came with the plate wasn't so bad but it's just the meat that kinda gets at you. Anyways  the first 10 minutes of walking around at IKEA and through the whole night, we were pretty much dehydrated and dying of thirst. I would only recommend this place if you really really really really really enjoy salty foods.

So I've been meaning to try this place and when I stopped by the first time they were still under construction so I waited for a couple of weeks and they were finally opened. I went here during lunch to get something quick and easy. I went in not expecting a whole lot from this place since I haven't really been too impressed with a lot of the revolving sushi restaurants here in AZ. It was really slow when I went during lunch, which I understand since sushi isn't really an ideal place to eat or have for lunch anyways...  The outside and inside of this place is actually pretty big and they have 3 main tables where the revolving sushi rotates around. I sat down and just looked at all their sushi rolls that they had and I can immediately tell that they weren't really that fresh. It looked like they've been sitting out for awhile and the avocados on some of the rolls were just looking a little too dark. Their Las Vegas roll was super cold, some of their rolls were just kind of falling apart and didn't really look like rolls anymore. I was not impressed and I was not satisfied with my lunch that day either so after approximately 30 min. of being there we just paid and left and I ended up getting Chickfila nuggets after =/  Service was ok, I can't really complain about our waitress really since we were the only ones in there but she was nice and she kept asking if we needed anything. There were also 3 young sushi chefs that were in the sushi bar area right across from us where we sat and when we walked in they just starred and didn't even acknowledge us and said hi or anything.

First time here for lunch over the weekend and it wasn't that busy. I ordered the tacos duo & my fiancé ordered the bb burger. We sat down and the server asked us what we wanted to drink and she didn't bring it out until like 10-15 minutes later...it was just lemonade and iced tea! I was getting thirsty... I took a bite out of the bb burger and wasn't really impressed. The bun is just too thick for the patty and makes everything too dried. We did end up asking for ketchup to help with the dryness but it just still wasn't as tasty.  The tacos duo was a lot better and actually pretty good with the tortilla chips but I wouldn't say it's amazing. I've been to a lot of vegan places that serves the tacos & black bean burger and they were just more flavorful then this place so I don't know if I would come back here. The food was just okay IMO and the customer service was eh...

This girl I met kept raving about this place so I finally came to check it out for dinner. Worse experience ever!!! As soon as we walked in the door everything just started to go downhill. I tried to be reasonable and understandable that things like this can happen but I don't know....it was just bad. First I asked for water with lemons. I got my water then 30 minutes later the waiter brought us new water cups with lemons in them? I asked the waiter what's the difference between Cornish hen kebob and the other chicken kebob dishes they had he said corn hen isn't chicken and he's not really sure that usually people get chicken breast kebob. Obviously he does not know the menu and apparently hen is not a chicken! Lol! We ordered the combo plate (chicken BREAST & beef) and waited for awhile. While waiting we noticed that a lot of customers were just disappointed in the lack of service. One family even left saying this is redic! So we even watched our order go to a different table & and this little girl put her hands all over it and the waiter brought it back to our table saying it's ours! We told him we don't want that...can u please take it back and make a new one....! He gave us this look like why? So it took 15 minutes and we got our new chicken & rice and the beef kebob came out separately 10 minutes later. It looked like there were only 2 cooks in the kitchen so the food was not great. I definitely felt like they were in a hurry to make our dish. I even over heard the girl waitress getting the orders messed up with another table and she asked them their order again saying sorry I'm new, it's my 4th day here. Now...I was just reading some previous Yelp reviews and someone mentioned the same waitress using this same excuse like 21 days ago!!!!!!!! Overall this place was so disappointing I would not go back!

I have been searching for a good grooming place in Gilbert and I finally found the best place!  Lisa and her family (the owners) are such great friendly people and I can honestly say I trust them with my little ones! I never feel bad for leaving them here because I know they really take good care of them and they are all really good to each single pet there. They also always ask to make sure what type of cut you want and it's always perfect every time! We received many compliments and I've been telling all my friends to take them here! What I really like about this place is obviously the customer service, the staff but also the fact that they let the little ones run around & play with other dogs (usually the smaller & behaved dogs). They are not locked up in their crate for hours like most pet groomers. They do ask for vaccination papers and the place is always clean so that is another big plus. They also provide boarding service for $20 per night per pet which isn't bad either. My dogs love it here and I love the staff here so I'm not going anywhere else! I'm really really happy I found them and I highly recommend them! Please go check them out and support them :)
