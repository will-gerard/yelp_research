Not only do the freaks come out at night, they come to Arizona Mills.   This place is ghet-tttooo. It's okay tho. I've got some hood in me. The discount outlets are great. It's the people there that scare me. It's like one of those places where you walk around with your purse zipped and held tight because someone might try to swoop it.   I swear, don't EVER go on a weekend. Good luck moving around all those damn diddly daddler people just strollin around the mall for some free air conditioning. WALK WITH A PURPOSE PEOPLE! Don't even get me started on the degenerate teenagers roaming around those parts. Where are your parents? Busy flipping burgers and cleaning houses to keep a roof over your house so you can be a punk ass kid at the mall?  The Off 5th is the only reason to go to this place, and thank god they have a separate entrance so you can be in and out in a flash. Oh, and the Forever 21 in this place is absurd. It's almost too much to handle.   But if you're feelin brave and you've got some mace, check out these outlets, you can generally get some decently priced name brand things.

I'm super disappointed by this place. I go to Side Door Corner Store (owned by the same people and share a kitchen) and love it. I've been meaning to try Uncle Sal's because I always hear great things about their food.  I came here last night for dinner with a group of girls and it's obvious we were out of place - everyone in the joint belonged in the geriatric department...not that I'm hating on it. Great food is great food and I don't care who eats where but if you're looking for a posh happenin spot to dine, this wouldn't exactly have the best vibes.   I think the biggest disappointment was the service. Though I'm sure she is nice lady, I felt like maybe she was overwhelmed because she seemed confused on just about everything. They were out of a tortellini dish and that's what my friend wanted to order so it's not rocket science that if you're out of one stuffed pasta, just replace it with another. My friend asked for the ravioli instead...shouldn't be that hard. The server acted like we were speaking martian. My friend was the first to order and as that whole bit was going down, I looked around at the rest of the table and you could just see the look of frustration on everyone's face...like for fuck's sake, this server is gonna be the death us. Bear in mind, many of us have worked in the industry so we know our shit and aren't usually overly critical. The check comes out and they charged my friends so much extra - like if you get a Caesar salad vs the house salad with your entree, there's an upcharge. Don't you think as a server, you would say something to your guest as a warning? She couldn't remember which wines we were drinking...it was just a clusterfuck and totally ruined the dining experience.   I ordered the steamed mussels and a side of the meatballs. The meatballs were cold...but the sauce was hot and the dish was hot. IDK if they just warmed up my food in the microwave or what, I didn't speak up because the server was already on my nerves and I didn't want to have to interact with her any more than necessary.   Another annoying thing is they don't do separate checks - the vibe when I saw that on the menu screaming at me was irritating. I get it. Split checks are so annoying, but guess what - so is your antiquated order taking system. She must not have a POS system to ring up on because the check came out and it was on the old school hand written checks. Seems like the restaurant owners aren't looking to get up with technology, but it's effecting the service and that needs to change ASAP.   Other than my meatballs being cold, the food is great which is why they get 2 stars. I really want to give it 3 but I don't think I'll come back unless I'm sitting at the bar, there are just other Italian options out there where service and food make for a better overall dining experience. Sorry Sal. Not into it.

You are most definitely allowed to have a dog in a restaurant if it's a service animal. By law, you are not allowed to ask me anything other than if she's a service animal. Doesn't have to wear a vest. Check the ADA laws before you offend someone.   Probably should also make sure the hostess doesn't give people a look like we're crazy. It's offensive and there are plenty of other sushi options in Old Town that won't be so judgemental.   I haven't eaten gotten my food and I'm turned off to this place right now.

Chances are that Chances Are is legit. Forget all these naysayers. They obvi don't know what they're talking about.   Btw, It's not Chances Are anymore it's Chances on 6th. Let's get this ish right.   I almost don't wanna review it because I don't want all the Scottsdale douchers to go here. I doubt they will. Chances Are has the same crowd as Grapevine. It's geriatric. There's no fist pumping, there's no crazy music. There's just an open space with cheap drinks and cheap food. I think I just love this place so much because of the people I'm with. Obvi. I'd write a five star review on a padded room as long as I'm rollin with the right crew.   So I've been here a time or two. And every time we're the youngest group in the place just goin ham. They see us coming, they bust out the Fireball. The owner/cook is the nicest guy ever. He once came out and did a round of Fireball with us. That's a business owner right there...he knows how to appreciate his guests. Don't expect grandeur or anything classy. Expect a cheap tab and stiff drinks. Don't expect to pick up on anyone here...unless of course you're in oxygen tanks and walkers. My boy Steve J knows all about that stuff. I'm sure he can reccommend a good walker.   My advice - stay away. Stay far far away from this place so we can keep it to ourselves. See ya never peeps.

I always come here for happy hour and yet I never make it for happy hour! I always miss it  by like 30  minutes! There seems to always be a wait around 5:30 or 6. A sign that this place must be good! The place is kind of off the beat and path - you'd have to know where it is to find it. You definitely wouldn't just stumble upon it out of no where.  Anyhow - I've been there twice and have loved it both times. The first time I got the Kiltlifter - I think its their most popular bc I work in a bar and everyone always asks for it. Then once we got our table, I got the beer sampler. I love those things...you get a little bit of each beer and it's wonderful! My friends and I shared the Nachos. Probably some of the best I've ever had. And I LOVE nachos.   Last night, I got the Peach Ale - delicious. Kinda girly, but it's what I was in the mood for. I decided to try something new and I got the quesadilla - also delicious. So good that I had a dream about quesadillas last night. hahah.  This place is a definite one of my fav's in Tempe. Amazing. Fun, laid back atmosphere.

YUM! I went here for lunch today with my roommate and everything was delicious. They have the best iced-teas in town. I always get the green tea with a little lemonade. My roommate got the berry iced tea which looked really good too. We shared everything today - we started with the jalapeno hummus. It's so good, they put a little pico de gallo in the center which gives it just the right kick. We split the small order and it was plenty! We also shared the classic greek salad - I love the lemon vinaigrette - so light and refreshing. Then we shared the pesto pizza. It normally comes on pita bread I think, but we got it on lavoush and it was huge! We definitely had left overs. I don't know why I don't come here more often but everything was delicious! I love it. I wanna try their breakfast too - the crepes sounded amazing.

First and foremost, I can't believe it's taken me this long to come here. A friend and I came in for lunch yesterday...if that's what you want to call it. I'll call it grown up Sunday Funday. I say grown up because we were super classy and drank wine. So we order a bottle of the rose, we're sitting at the baron the outside enjoying the fine Sunday afternoon. The place is relatively busy considering it was that awkward time between lunch and dinner.   We ordered the deviled eggs. um. duh. Of course they were great. Kinda hard to eff up a boiled egg. But there's is real good - bacon on top. Anything with bacon on top is better. Well you know, after some girl gabbing and a few glasses of crisp wine, and some eggs, we just had to order another bottle of wine. The bartender was a gem. So attentive to our glasses - were never empty for more than a minute. She knew what she was doing that's for sure. Then we ordered the baked mac and cheese with bacon on top - so damn good. I might have been buzzed eating but that was some preeetttyyy good mac. And I know mac. I guess the reoccuring theme here is bacon and wine. I don't hate it.   There were these three douchey old men that insisted we scoot over so they could sit at the bar...he kept calling the bartender honey sugar or some name of endearment. I threw up in my mouth a bit.   The only reason it's not 5 stars is because there were like a billion flies. Okay, I get it, I was sitting outside, and they were doing their best with the high powered fans but that shit was still nasty. Flies in or around a restaurant is a big no no. Go get one of those blue zappy light things and exterminate those little fuckers cus I'm pretty sure one ALMOST landed on an egg and that would have been real gross. Flies throw up or poop or whatever every time they land. Yeah think about that. Real appetizing. I'm fairly positive I'll be back for plenty more grown up Sunday Fundays because that outside patio, sans flies, is the perfect little relaxing spot to get a good Sunday buzz.

A friend of mine was having a birthday party at the Valley Ho last weekend and we decided to come here for breakfast before a day of debauchery at the pool. I ordered the California Eggs Benedict (can't remember if that's what it was actually called, but there's only two on the menu and it wasn't the traditional one). HOLY MOLY that ish was delish. Legit might be one of the best benny's I've ever had. I asked the server if they had wheat English Muffins and she said no, just homemade. "Just Homemade" - best English muffins hands down. I don't even wanna think how it contributed to my own muffin...muffin top that is.   Anyhoo, we came back here again the next day for breakfast. I didn't wanna be the freak that orders the same thing twice so I ordered the special...breakfast veggie quesadilla. It was good. For sure good. But it wasn't the benny. However, this time around I decided to go with Bloody Mary Bar. GREAT choice. Fantastic choice. It was only $5 and they have a great selection of items to build your own bloody and I'm not gonna lie, I made a damn fine drink.   I love me some good breakfast joints and this might be up there as one of my new favs. I think I'll just be the freak that always orders the same thing. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And that Benny ain't broke.

I went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with my bosses. It was packed on a Friday - we sat at the bar and our cook was fantastic! We got to sit and chat with him while he worked away at the orders. I had the chicken pesto pasty and it was wonderful! the bread used is similar to a pastry dough type...but not as sweet. The pasty was so filling, I could barely finish it.  My bosses have been there before and have always wanted to try the peanut butter and jelly pasty - so we all split it as dessert and it was so good. They put bananas in it and drizzle jelly over the whole pasty. It's definitely rich and gooey.   I would totally go back here again and have told my friends about it too! Amazing place.

The review is for the Marina boat rental business. Not for the lake. The lake is great! It's beautiful and on a nice day, being on a boat on the water is near nirvana. But why the heck do these people continue to run Groupons??!?! Good luck reserving a boat. I bought a Groupon a year ago and I haven't been able to book it!! Every weekend is booked from now until mid-August. Oh wait, they're running another Groupon today sooooo that means everything will be booked until October. I don't know about you people, but I work every day of the week and I can't go out on the lake during the week. There isn't enough supply for these people to be running so many damn Groupons.   My friend bought a Groupon the same day we did and fortunately enough, she called at the perfect time and was able to book hers on Memorial Day weekend (I have no clue how. She must be a miracle worker). We got there and everything ran relatively smoothly except for the 12 year old working the Marina Office. Aren't there child labor laws in AZ?   The best part about this lake are the otters that live under the Marina!!! Supposedly there's a family of three. I only saw one of them for brief second but it was the cutest thing I've ever seen. Plus 1 star for cute critters.  I wish the Boat Rental biz would stop running Groupons or buy more boats so they handle the influx of business. I've never been more frustrated. All I want to do is go on the lake and drink some damn beers on a boat! Get it together!  UPDATE: I received a call from them just now. I feel it only fair to explain it further. My rating still says the same. After trying to book this damn Groupon when I first bought it, I gave up when all that was available on the weekends was dated out until October (I bought it in June). So I tried again in April of this year, every weekend was booked until the end of June. I don't know about you but I can't plan my life two months in advance. Maybe for a vacation or something big - but a day on the lake? The Groupon was expiring so I called the Marina and they said they might honor it past the expiration date. Great! That's awesome. Still unsure of when to use the damn thing since I don't want to go out on a boat alone and need to coordinate with friends, I held off on making the appt on the phone. I emailed twice, maybe even three times to the gentleman I spoke to to book it in August (since there were no more weekends open). No reply. Finally, I call. He tells me that they'll only extend to July. Well, F. There are only weekdays open. And not even that many Fridays. Obviously, I can't use it on the 4th. Strapped to make a decision I just give in and say the 5th. Which I will probably now cancel and eat the $170 I paid for the Groupon. I still think the situation sucks and they're overselling themselves. A. Don't promote a deal in the summer if you're gonna booked until Winter. and B. Don't take into account the availability you have during the week as most people WORK. So after this fiasco, will I ever rent a boat here? No. My mom rented one from Lake Pleasant and it was awesome. So maybe that's where I'll take my money. Full price no less.

This review is very long overdue. It's been a year and a half since I've been back to Gene's. But it's one of the best auto shops I've ever been to. I was heading out of town for the 4th and was driving to SD so I needed to get my car checked. I was convinced I needed new brakes since my car kept squeaking and my check engine light was on too. I was fully prepared to drop some major cash on getting my car fixed.   I called up Gene's and made an appointment. The chick that answered was super helpful and really nice. I let her know I found them on Yelp and that they had an offer for a free tire rotation and she said it'd be no problem. I drop my car off with a pit in my stomach and a heavy heart knowing I'm losing major money fixing the stupid thing. I get a call from Gene later that day and he tells me i have about 60% on my brakes!! And that he changed my oil, ran a diagnostics test on my car and rotated my tires. Said I didn't need new brakes. 1. I couldn't believe he was so honest and 2. I spent less than $40. Best experience with a mechanic. Hands down.  I just wish it was closer to where I live so I could take it back there for service. If you're in the area - definitely check it out. I've told anyone I know to go there.

I don't think there are enough stars for how amazing Goober is!   Someone had recommended them to me a while ago and I checked out their Yelp page and was convinced that I needed to use them. They have sooo much stuff on their website to choose from. But the MOST amazing thing they offer is free delivery. It comes the next day and is always delivered with a bag of treats. My dogs aren't usually biscuit dogs but they love the ones from Goober. It's weird. I know. Idk how they know the difference.   I compared the prices of Goober with big name pet stores and Goober is cheaper. Have I mentioned the next day free delivery? Sometimes if you order early enough in the morning, it'll even come that day.   I hate lugging around 30+ lb bags of dog food so I'm so happy I only have to drag it through my living room.   Oh!!! And you can choose which rescue org you want 1% of your purchase to go. Pretty amazing.   Thank you times 100 Goober!!

Moving is a complete pain in the ass but Camelback Moving definitely made the process a lot easier for me. With 94 reviews and 4.5 stars, I knew this was the company to go with. I'm sure there are cheaper companies out there but I'd rather spend a little more money and keep my sanity with a company I can rely on.  Anthony and Paul were amazing. They wrapped everything up and made sure there was no damage to any of my stuff. I have a lot of crap and they took care of everything with ease. This is the first time I've hired professional movers and I'm glad I did.   Movers aren't cheap but they're worth it. I'd definitely suggest anyone considering hiring a company to use these guys because they're professional and trustworthy. They even called me the day after my move to make sure everything was satisfactory.

I'm so unbelievably annoyed with Macy's. Particularly this Macy's and the absolute lack of knowledge by their sales people. You would think people dealing in fine jewelry would know what the F they're talking about.   My mom bought me these diamond hoop earrings for Xmas and I took them to exchange for a pair of diamond earrings. The sales lady was nice (kinda pressured me..but in a nice way..she dealt with all my going back and forth). Ultimately, I opted for some diamond earrings that were on clearance (they were still $400 so it's not like I'm not droppin bills). The lady convinces me to buy the extended warranty specifically saying that it covers my earrings being converted into screwbacks - a necessity for earrings. So I finally said okay. I told her I'd bring them back to get them done since I wanted to wear them on New Years and my bday.   So I take them in last week and the ladies working the counter were nice enough to help me out. I'm pretty sure she even confirmed that my earrings would be taken care of FREE of charge since I already purchased the extended warranty.   Fast forward to today. Joyce calls me (I'm not sure if she's the one who took my earrings when I came in to get them serviced) to tell me she has an estimate. What?  Estimate for what? My earrings?!?!?! Well apparently Macys will only cover the screwbacks if the earrings are over $1,500. Why the F didn't anyone tell me that before? So no. I don't want to pay $130 for my earrings to be serviced. I'm sure I can find somewhere far less expensive to get them done. Oh wait, so now I'm not going to have my earrings back for another week. FUCKING A. I'm beyond irritated.   Macys has been steadily declining over the years and this has just been the icing on the cake. This is why I will always shop at Nordstrom. Their customer service is far beyond any other major retailer. Macys can keep their stupid sales and their stupid customer service. I'm over it.

The company I work for just moved here and while it's all beautiful and brand new, their dog policy is awful. Our company let us put together a calendar to schedule when we each would bring our canine companions to work. We're in ad tech sales and the ability to bring our pooches to the office has always been one of the best perks of the job. There's numerous studies that have been conducted that prove overall productivity and morale is up when pets are around.   The office we came from was full of lawyers, accountants, and all around boring businesses but that property management company still allowed our small team to bring our dogs in. We're not heathens, we looked after them and picked up after them. Other tenants loved us having them around.   I can't speak to anything other than their general disinterest in working with us to amend the policy. All I got back when I inquired into the rationale behind the policy was "it's always been that way". Great. Well that's not what I asked. I asked WHY. Get it together Skysong. This is supposed to be a new hub for tech type companies, but if you don't let your tenants dictate their own company policies, I can't foresee you being able to recruit as many big time tech companies as you'd like.

I went to The Mission for lunch with my bosses and it was great! I've been wanting to go for some time now and I really want to check out their brunch on Sundays which I heard was amazing.  The ambiance is really laid back and mellow but in a cool, retro hip way. We sat at the bar for lunch and everything was great. I had the skirt steak tacos which were absolutely delicious - I was so full but I wanted more! We also got the basket of french fries...a combination of traditional fries and sweet potato fries. OMG. so good.  You should definitely go check it out if you haven't already - the food and drinks are great!

I almost don't even want to write a review for this place. It's so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just don't know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So I'll attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:  A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that we've spent thousands of dollars here over the years. You're welcome Lodge.  B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said.  C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I haven't seen him around much lately and I'm pretty sure that's why I've been at Kelly's more recently) D. Black-outs D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above.  E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea.   The only reason why there's not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way.   Oh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces.

I came here for Mother's Day Brunch. The food was fantastic and my mom and grandma were very excited. I've been to Kai before and was hoping they'd be open for brunch, but sadly they weren't.   It was $65/person for brunch - pricey for a 4 course meal. It wasn't your standard Mother's Day Brunch buffet but was really good food. I have no complaints about the food at all - I think it was amazing. My only issue is the vibe felt off - it didn't feel like the ambiance of the place matched how much I was paying for brunch. The servers weren't the most knowledgeable about the food...he recommended queso fresco for my grandma's filet because she doesn't like goat cheese. queso fresco?! NO. He was nice, don't get me wrong. But if I'm about to drop $400 on brunch, I want someone with some knowledge. Also, we went for awhile without refills on water or tea. That's annoying. Those are the major reasons I deducted a star because otherwise the food was really good. The presentation was gorgeous. I'll upload the pics. I def took a lot.   Overall, I wouldn't come to Ko'Sin. I'd rather just spend the money and go to Kai where the servers are super knowledgeable and the ambiance feels more upscale...the pricing matches. I'm not articulating myself well. Here's an example, say you walk into a diner and you pay $20 for a burger. While it's still a great burger and definitely probably worth the $20, you still feel like you overpaid just because you're in a diner. I hope that makes more sense.

This review is a little late. But so necessary. Earlier this month, I was going on a week long vacation to Mexico and needed someone to watch my two boys. I thought I had everything squared away and was going to have some friends stop in and check on them. Then I realized I don't necessarily trust my friends on the weekends and would feel better having a professional come by, especially because one of my pups is a wee bit skiddish (and by wee bit, I mean a lot).   Tim was great. I literally called probably 4 days before my trip and he came by to do the registration meeting. I felt fully comfortable with him watching my babies. While I was gone, I got emails updating on their status which is always assuring since I was in another country! When I got back, the boys were happy and healthy and I had a wonderfully sweet note left on the counter.   I cannot express how grateful I am that Tim came to my rescue. As long as I'm in his service area, I'll always be using Absolute Pet Care. Call him now. Don't hesitate and tell him Tiffany and General and Nino sent you!

Time to write a review on the grocery store of my people.   First and foremost, it's an Asian Market - it's gonna stink. So the reviews that mention the wretched smell...DUH.   The produce is here is so cheap. I can walk about with two huge bags and pay less than $20. It's not going to necessarily be all organic or the prettiest looking, but it'll go in and out of your body the same way that AJ's $4 apple does.   There's a nice assortment of different types of Asian food here from Korean to Indian to Thai. You've definitely got your pick.   The seafood department is where its at. It's where I go to pick up seafood whenever I'm making Cioppino. The seafood is pretty fresh and really inexpensive.   Winning.   I just started juicing too so I come here to pick up a ton of produce for cheap! Kale is all the rage these days and I can get a big bunch for $.99. People are paying $4 a bag! Yet again. I win.   Final win - you get 10% off your whole purchase.

I'd been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time - then out of no where, the bf decided to grow a romatical bone and took me here for dinner one Sunday night. The place is tiny - but it's packed full of good food and good people. We sat at the bar, which is awesome because we got to watch the chefs do their magic. I can't remember what we started off with. But we split the Chicken Jidori and spicy broccoli. The broccoli was delicious, it had pistachios on it that I kept picking off with my fingers. I couldn't help myself! The chicken was juicy and served with spaetzel. I'd never had it but I could definitely hear my boyfriend moaning over how good everything tasted.  Little did we know that on Sunday nights, they do a late night special - this particular evening it was fried crawfish with a thai fish sauce served over rice. AMAZING. It was a heaping amount of Crawfish, for less than $15. I thought we would only get 6 or so. And there was a giant mound. This place was great. The server was a gem, the chefs hook it up with great food and I'm sure I'll be back on a Sunday for the Late Night Special. Apparently, if you follow them on FB, you'll get updates on what they're serving up for the special.   Next on my list from these great people is Baratin - they just opened up a little wine bar cafe and I'm sure the food is going to be just as amazing.

How have I never reviewed this place? Oh wait. I know. Because I don't want all you Old Town Douchers crowding my spot.   I love this place so much. It's a definite escape from the regular Old Town bars. I def feel a lot more classy when i walk into this joint...as in I'm not going to get my ass grinded on by some fool sweatin out his molly.   They have great drinks. The bartenders, excuse me I mean, Mixologists know their stuff. I decided recently that I love gin. And they have such an amazing gin cocktail. It's called the Goule. There's fresh basil in it. bomb.com. Have a few of those in a night. Be careful, they go down real easy but they pack a punch.   I haven't had a full on meal here - just a bunch of shared apps and drinks and that's more than enough to keep this girl happy. The grilled cheese has prosciutto. Winning.   So there's a secret room in the back where the book case is. I haven't been in there and I feel like I'd look a little silly tugging on all the books trying to figure out which one opens the secret door, but get enough Goule's in me and I might just do it. I know you can rent it out privately which I'm sure could be a real good time. Could get a lil weird. But I don't hate it.

I love this place. I know I should be supporting local businesses but they do such a great job. They're located inside the Petsmart which makes it super convenient to pick up treats for the pups as well.   I do the optimum wellness plan which is amazing. I pay a monthly fee and it includes all the annual vaccinations, a comprehensive exam with bloodwork, and a dental cleaning. For the amount that I pay for the optimum plan, I'd probably spend just that amount on ONE teeth cleaning for only ONE of my dogs.   They always call to remind me about scheduling appointments and they even call the next day to check in and see how the dogs are doing after they've gone under. I've never had a problem with the staff. Especially since they started to remember to put my dogs' name on the welcome list! **picture uploaded**.  The fees are relatively inexpensive and they're always answering my dumb questions.

Third class here this morning. Second time doing Xtreme Barre.   Let's just say this. I don't think I'm going to be able to walk for a week.   I'm not by any means a super fit person. I maybe work out once a week. Maybe. I work out my liver a whole lot more....  I decided to go straight for the jugular the first time I came here and started with Xtreme Barre. I died a little, but in a good way. I did Ballet Boxing a few months later, died a little then too. Both of those classes were with Brooke. Today I think I had Shandi as the instructor for Xtreme Barre. Both of them are great. They help and they're motivating - not like some other gyms/classes where you want to slap the instructor.   Everyone there is super in shape and it's obvious these classes are working for them. I've never done Barre classes elsewhere but I can imagine that these are the hardest. I feel like almost throwing up, but at the same time, I don't feel like an outcast. Everyone is just there to get their work out in and feel great afterwards. It's a great small studio and all the equipment is there for you. Hopefully, I can start going more regularly and build my muscles because I'm pretty sure I'm really weak right now.

So I bought a LivingSocial to this place because I've always heard people saying how amazing it is. The deal was for two weeks unlimited and I went to 8 classes in those two weeks and I can say I definitely noticed a difference.   I love this place. Let's be honest here, I HATE working out. But I actually enjoy these classes. They go by quickly and the music is great. The classes in the evenings are usually pretty full and you have to register in advance but the waitlist moves pretty quickly. My favorite instructors are Abby, Jasmine, and Shayla. I think I've only ever had two or three other instructors but I make it a point to choose these ladies because I feel like they're the best at helping with your form and motivating you to keep going when your thighs are shaking and you think you're gonna give up.   This studio is connected with the Arcadia and Chandler locations too so if you purchase a membership, you can go to all three studios which is convenient if you have friends in other parts of the Valley.   I did the new client month unlimited after my LivingSocial expired and I've done a total of 18 or so classes now and I can totes tell a difference. I've been super busy and haven't gone to class in a week and I feel like a slob. These classes are addicting. They're super pricey so get  ready to shell out $23 for a drop in class or pony up $175 for the month unlimited. It's worth it.

How the heck have I never written a review for the boxx?   How do I rate this place? At times I want to give it a -17 because I can't believe I let myself get roped into this dungeon of a hellhole. But then other times, it's a definite 5 star all around because you just danced your ass off  and you're def not mad at it.   I don't think I would ever plan to start my night off at Smash but I def have countless stories of somehow ending up there to close out the night. When you see someone check in here on any night you know it's rage time. You don't just casually walk into this place for a drink and little dancing. You come here to get fucking weird. This is where your memories come to die and your black outs thrive. Turnt up to new level.   I would definitely not recommend you come here if you're faint at heart or are prone to seizures. I probably wouldn't recommend ladies coming here unless you're in a big group. I would never do a girl's night here to prowl for men because I think the only ones I've ever seen were questionable...my company excluded. obvi.   I have such a love hate relationship with this shit hole. I hate that I love to come here. And every time I do, I don't regret it. I dance my face off and make great life decisions.   Extra point because I came here once and somehow my ratchet self lost my wallet. They found it and the VIP manager or whatever looked me up on Facebook to tell me it was there. So legit.

I like this place. The boyfriend doesn't. He's partial to Harkins. But I prefer this theater because it's typically pretty empty and we don't have to listen to bratty kids talking through the whole movie. We've been here a couple times - tried their food from the cafe. Ehhh. It was just okay. But the big leather seats are comfy and I really want to try their DBlock seats. They move around with the movie so it's almost like you're on a ride! We sat in the row right behind the DBlock seats and I was so jealous, I just wanted to kick the guy in front of me and steal his seat. Obvi, I refrained.   They have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the tickets are only $5. I'll take that over the super expensive tickets at Harkins any day.

This has to be one of my most favorite restaurants in Old Town. I bought a Groupon or Livingsocial or some deal to try it for the first time. Went with the bf on a Friday for a date night. We got there around 7 or so and the place was relatively empty - I was slightly nervous but I'd heard so many good things about this place, I knew it must've just been early.   We started with two dirty martinis, more like filthy martinis - just how i like it. Then we ordered the Chicken and Waffles appetizer, so good. It was mouthwatering delicious, I probably could've eaten 5 more plates. Then we had the Chopped Salad. It's effing amazing. I dream of this salad - I mean it does have its own FB page. Writing this makes me want it in my belly this second. For dinner, the beau got the scallops and I got the short ribs. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh don't forget to have a moscow mule while you're there too.   By the time we left, the place was packed and I was so full I thought I needed a wheelchair.   I'm sure I'll be back for that salad and to try just about everything else on the menu.

I really like to hate on this place. It's so easy (cue Staples Easy Button) - it's douchebag central. Ladies, if you want to find a roided out meathead, bro-tank wearing, Scottsdale doucher fist pumping the night away, you've come to the right place. Fellas, if you're looking for two-bit skank with hooha's hanging out of her child-sized wifebeater, you're in for a treat. So why the 4 stars? Because, when you're blacked out, this place is fun. Not gonna lie. It's the type of place you go to when you're already 5 shots deep and you're just lookin for trouble. I, personally, am a fan of house music so I love the loud, in-your-face music blaring overhead. Some people can't stand house, so preeettttyyyy sure this ain't the spot for them.   Those of you looking for a mellow spot to sip on a marg should probs walk over to Cien Agave and relax there. But those of you looking to make some bad life decisions and who might want to make out with strangers should def head to good ol' Hefe.   If it's not absurdly busy with people stomping on your feet with their 8 inch hooker wedges, def get a bulldog margarita. It's delish and can def help kick start your buzz.   Proceed with caution friends.

It's clearly time for me to write an update since I am the duchess and all. What can I say. I love this place. I used to hate it and judge on it hard core but let's just say I'm going through a phase where I'm reliving my younger early 20's. (If you thought to yourself, but wait! Isn't she like only 24? Then bless your heart and we should be BFF).  I mean I'm pretty much here at LEAST once a week. Most likely 2-3 times. Mostly to rage face on the weekends. Sunday Funday? DUH. I'm usually pretty hamskied by the time I walk over here but I'm pretty sure you can find me dancing somewhere around the bar.   I can say that now have actually eaten the food here and it's def better than I thought it was gonna be. I've had brunch here before...they don't do bottomless but they do like a $15 schooner and then penny refills. Not mad at it. I can't remember what I had for brunch but I'm pretty sure I didn't eat it bc I was hung over and about to vom. But I think the bite or two that I did have were pretty tasty. The tacos are pretty good too - I've had the steak, chicken and beef cheek. Beef cheek is probs my fav. Get it. Don't be a puss.   Hefe is in my little hot corner and I do love me some of that hot corner - it's always packed! but I think with Bottled Blonde opening up, there's been a little more breathing room.   Hefe..hefe..hefe..**sigh** so many blurred memories. All of which I'm sure were a great time.

This might be my new favorite breakfast spot. Went here a couple weekends ago with some girlfriends and the food was bomb.com. I got the chorizo skillet and it was amazing. I wasn't even hungry and I ate the whole plate. (It's a problem, I know I need to work on not eating when I'm not hungry but food is so GOOD!)  The service was average - I can't think that anything was wrong. But even if it was bad, I'd go back. I def have to try some other things and I'm sure I'll update when appropriate. I've been craving that damn skillet since I've had it. Isn't it a little odd to crave chorizo and eggs? Idk. Seems a lil weird to me. But clearly it made an impression.

Okay. This is my second landscaper review. Weird. But I think these guys are great. I bought a LivingSocial deal and they were prompt in getting out to do my yard work. Within a week, they were here cleaning up the nasty weeds in my yard. I asked for a quote because I was curious about how much monthly service would be and Sandra emailed me the next day. It was reasonable and about what I had been paying with my previous landscaper but Clean Service Pro did a better job.   A few weeks later, I finally pulled the trigger and had them do a heavy duty cleaning to start and then I signed on for monthly maintenance. I emailed Sandra on Monday and she got me scheduled for Wednesday. The guys are still here and it's been about two hours. My yard looks brand new!   Maybe the other reviewer had a one off experience - I'm not sure. But Clean Service Pro has been amazing. Sandra is prompt with her emails back and even sent me an email last night reminding me the guys are coming out.

I really like the vibe of this place. Been here a few times and it's always a good time. They have some awesome beers and you can create your own sampler since they're only $1 or $2. The food is decent. I've had the brisket sandwich and I tried a salad once. The service is kind of hit or miss at this place. Sometimes it's great and sometimes you sit there waiting forever.   They have a pretty big patio out back, I haven't been out there yet since it's hot as balls right now. But I'm sure I'll be hitting it up once the temperature drops. The inside is pretty legit too, bar atmosphere, but they have this back room area that's got some couches for lounging...that part is kinda dark and relatively sketch but I could def see myself getting loud and tipsy back there.   Overall, it's a good spot and one that I'm sure I'll visit often.

Words cannot describe how much I adore this place. Over the past month, I think I've been here at LEAST once a week. John and Dave are the best bartenders around - always so accommodating and friendly. My friend is Italian and has grown up drinking negronis (I'm not a fan, but she is) and is pretty picky about how they're made. John does is perfectly. I always get either a Moscow or a Gin Fizz - they're always delicious. The tots and duck fat fries are delicious. I mostly drink when I'm here but I've had a few things. I've tried their pork belly BLT too...preeetyyy damn good.   It's not a super busy place and I'd prefer it stay that way. I probably shouldn't even be reviewing this place since I don't want a bunch of people there crowding my space and I really don't want the Scottsdale douchers coming through here.

I've been here twice now. I came once for a team lunch for work - the lunch specials they have are amazing! $15 for an app and an entree and a beverage. The guac is delicious! I had the mahi tacos and they were pretty good too. The tacos are real small but pack tons of flavor. The second time I went, I bought a Livingsocial deal for two margs and two entrees. The margaritas were really good, they taste fresh. I didn't get a flavored one, but I'd be interested next time. I got the shrimp and chorizo tacos and the boyfriend got the duck fundido. I don't think it was what he expected, but it was good. There's a good amount of duck in the dish too, it's just really greasy. To be expected, duck and cheese? I mean come on. We got the plantains and corn rice as sides and they were pretty good too. We just were so full we couldn't finish everything.   After dinner, we sat at the bar and talked to the manager and the bartender about all the different kinds of tequila they have. Super nice people. The best part about this place is the glittery tables! The decor is really fun. Personally, I like the food at the Mission better but this place has a really fun vibe. And I mean, come on the owner is Iron Chef Garces! That's pretty amazing.

So obviously everyone that left anything less than 5 stars for this place is looney. I almost don't want to write a review because I don't want more people to find out about this place. It's a hidden gem and it needs to stay that way.   It's a legit spot for sure. Yeah, it's a little weird that you have to wait at the bottom of the stairs and call a number before you get up there. But that's the whole point. It's playing into the speakeasy vibe they're going for. Get with it people. If you can't appreciate what they're doing - maybe you should walk over to RockBar and grab a drink. Sounds like it's more your kind of place.   R+D is for people who can appreciate the art of mixology. They have crazy ingredients that you're just not gonna find at any ol' bar. I tried a couple drinks up there and they were delicious - unlike any cocktail I've ever had. I can't remember the names of them, but one was gin with crystallized ginger and muddled blackberries. The other drink I had was some kind of pink martini. It could possibly be one the prettiest drinks I've ever had. It has shaved pearl in it!?? Like who thinks of this kind of stuff? The pearl gave the drink a gorgeous iridescent sheen. It was like too pretty to drink. haha. jk. I drank it. All of it.   Shout out to Chris, he dealt with my friend and I last Thursday. "Um. Sir, have you read 50 shades of grey? Because this place has a Christian Grey vibe going on". Ladies, that should be enough said.

First to review? CHACHING!  I've been going to Dr. Allan for a few years now. My whole family goes to him. He's super nice and friendly. However, I hadn't been to the dentist in over two years - needless to say, I was a bit nervous. I knew that I was going to have at least one cavity. I'm glad that's all it was, let's be real, I was pretty certain I was going to need a root canal. I kept telling all my friends I could feel the hole in my tooth with my tongue.  Anyhoo, I got over the anxiety and made an appointment. I probably was the worst patient ever with the no-shows and reschedulings because of work schedules. But I finally made it in and they were nice as can be. I was taken to the treatment room right away and they got to work my 18 xrays! 18! EFF! That's what happens when you don't go to the dentist for two years. The dental assistant was really sweet and kept making sure I was okay. I got the xrays, teeth cleaning, and two cavities filled and was out in an hour! With no need to come back for at least another 6 months for my next cleaning. BOOM! Talk about an efficient appointment. Dr. Allan's gentle and let's you know what's going on and their office is gorgeous. I definitely was feeling the upbeat music, made it feel a little more young. Def not your typical stodgy dental office.

I was here the other night for a networking/mixer event. I'd heard this place was overrated and and expensive so I probably would never have come here if the event wasn't held here.   Couple things that are okay. -Bar (better be okay or they'd be screwed) -decor (the place has a fun vibe for sure hence why they get an extra star)  Couple things that suck big time: -IDIOT cocktail server (someone asked for a hoppy beer, she said right away she didn't have one. but not because she knew what he meant, but just assumed they didn't. then when he went through 5 different types of beers, she didn't know them. Come on chick, your job is to get people drinks. Learn what you have and what you don't. There were other things she did that blew my mind - my friend ordered a glass of wine and then gave the server her CC. After which, she asked for water. The girl was like "water on the card?" OMG. I almost threw my drink in her face for being so dumb) -Food - they had some happy hour specials. (Mediocre at BEST. My friend got the chicken tacos. I had a bite and they were okay. I wouldn't pay for that. They weren't god awful but they sure as well weren't something to write home about. Rather, they're something you wish you didn't eat because the calories just weren't worth it. We also ordered the buffalo dip. It was good! Thank god. But how the hell could you mess up cream cheese and buffalo sauce. That's just win win.)  Aside from the people there for the event, I really don't think anyone else was there. And I'm pretty sure it wasn't a closed event. Will I be back? Chances are highly unlikely. I'd rather spend my hard earned cash at a place with better food and better drinks and servers that I don't feel like smacking up side the face.

This was such a great dinner. First, a friend and I started at the bar. They have a great happy hour, $5 drinks and half off their cheese plates. I had a couple of their Gin Tom Collins. Yum. Never thought I was a gin girl until recently. We shared the mozzarella plate. It was sooooo good. It had carmelized onions, bacon bits, and a balsamic reduction drizzle. I'm salavating just thinking of it.   Once we got into the main dining room, we sat at the oversized community table. Definitely a really cool, mellow vibe going on in there. They have a 3-course meal for $35. We went through the courses and picked out 3 each so we could taste a little of everything. Perfecto. A few of my favorites were the squid ink risotto and the butterfish? I can't remember which fish course I enjoyed more. But overall, everything was delicious and I'm sure I'll be back.   They're tucked away so you can't really see them from the street. I hope it stays that way so it doesn't become over flooded with people, because I'm sure once they get the experience, they'll be coming back time and time again.

I honestly have no idea how this place has as many stars as it does. It's been awhile since I've been. I went once with a friend for Brunch on a Sunday. The first sign that a place is less than stellar is when you're the only guests in the joint. I chalked it up to being a newer place.   The decor and ambiance are def on point. But the location makes it feel super out of place. It should be in Old Town if it's gonna be decorated like that, not on McDowell and Miller.   I ordered the corned beef hash and it was bleh. Nothing special, and my friend ordered a different hash and hers was just not good. Plain and simple not good. The cheese was cut into little squares and all sweaty looking. I mean the presentation of both dishes definitely deserve an A for effort. But you can make a piece of rubber look pretty but it ain't gonna taste good. That's for sure. Another concerning factor was that my friend ordered grapefruit juice. First, she asked if it was fresh squeezed and they said yes. Ummm. No way no how this was fresh squeezed - it was def out of a can and it was def spoiled. You know when juice has been left out too long and it starts to get fizzy because it's fermenting or something? Well that was her juice. Gross.  Needless to say I've never been back and I will never go back. Their burgers look and sound amazing but I'm not willing to spend money on this place. I don't know how they're even open still. I'm seriously questioning how these people have left great reviews because it sucked.   And Marius E.'s review saying it's similar to the Vig, St Francis, Windsor or Postino?!!??! Are you on crack fool?

This might be my new favorite restaurant...it's made the top 10 list. The past two Fridays, I've been here for dinner and everything is amazing. The second you walk up, you can just tell this is going to be a great dinner spot. The patio is just about the cutest thing ever - it's like you're transported outside of the Valley into this magical little courtyard with twinkle lights everywhere (what girl doesn't love twinkle lights?)  The only cocktail I've had there is the Watermelon Cooler (I'll add the pic). It's a refreshing gin cocktail equipped with fresh watermelon juice and effen cumcumber vodka - everything I love in a cup. The food is amazing. Both times I went, my girlfriends and I shared everything. Some of the highlights are the Burrata with leeks, the berkshire pork belly with udon noodles, and the Duck Confit meatballs. We also tried the lobster fried rice, crab legs, Pork Ribs, and Halibut. Everything is good but my favorite is the pork belly with udon noodles. It's just so GD good.   They've only been open about a month so they warn you that they're working out the kinks in service and what not. It doesn't matter. They could make me wait a year and I'd still sit there and sipon my cocktail among good friends to wait for their amazing food.   Hats off to you House Brasserie. I'll be back soon.

Heck Yes. First to review. I always forget to review service businesses. It's just not nearly as fun to review as restaurants/bars. But these guys deserve a review.   I called them and another company to get a bid on getting my yard cleaned up. It was ridiculous back there. Legit jungle status. The weeds were getting to be as tall as me and the bushes were out of control. I called and spoke to a very friend woman. She sent me an email confirmation and had Scott coming the next day to give me a bid. They were significantly less expensive than the other bid I got (a company I also found on Yelp with FAR MORE reviews than Greenstar). I scheduled for their first available day and they did an amazing job. My backyard is a whole new place and we're on monthly service with them. I wish they had once a month service because my yard is mostly rock and doesn't need to be upkept too much. But their prices are so reasonable.   Not only is the customer service great, but they're green too! They take the trimming and yard debris and compost it instead of filling landfills. They have a really simple online payment system too. Great job guys! I'm sure my dogs are happy to have a clean yard to tromp through.

I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place for $45 for two hours of cleaning. I know I didn't specifically request deep cleaning but I really wonder what the hell the girl was doing for two hours. I recently moved out of a house and called on these people to do a move out clean. I figured with no furniture and nothing to dust, it wouldn't take that long to clean the kitchen and bathrooms. I didn't go inside to inspect the house until after the girl left but when I did, I was sorely disappointed. First off, she was 45 minutes late (okay, I get that things happen, but at least give me a call so I'm not sitting there waiting). Secondly, the bathroom cleaning was a joke. The microwave wasn't cleaned. The ceiling fans weren't cleaned. I mean I think she just cleaned the floors and vacuumed. She maybe ran a dust cloth over the counters. It was a joke. I've vacuumed my house before and it takes a total of 20 minutes...MAYBE 30 minutes. I have no idea what this chick was doing for 2 hours but I know I'll never call them again.   The thing is, I told the people when I scheduled that I was moving out and obviously I understand I only paid for 2 hours and didn't necessarily expect it to be in 2 hours so I was prepared to pay the difference. I'm irritated that I bought this deal. I should've known better and just paid full price to get it done. Now I have to go back and clean up. Beyond annoyed with these people.   They get +1 star because they have an automated email that confirms your appointment...but it doesn't matter because she'll show up late anyway.

I've been going to this place for awhile. I'm going to be honest. I could probably lose the weight on my own but I definitely couldn't do it as fast. It's a regimented diet that includes appetite suppressants and supplements but it works. If you follow their guidelines, you will definitely lose weight.   I started in November and in 6 weeks, I lost 15 lbs. I stopped going just before the Holidays because I knew I wasn't keeping an accurate record of what I was eating but I just started back up again 3 weeks ago and I'm down 5 lbs. So I'm back where I left off.   The staff is great and knows your name. The appointments are very quick so you can definitely fit it into your busy schedule. If you're like me and are impatient and want to lose weight quickly and not by fasting or juicing, I highly recommend giving them a shot. I'll be pool party ready soon!

This place is awesome. I don't often go furniture shopping but I just moved into my own place and purged a lot of my old stuff so I needed to get a new couch, dinner set, and tv stand. I hate feeling like I'm getting hustled but I definitely did not feel that way at LivingSpaces. I walked in and was browsing around when Jason approached me and asked me if I needed any help. He was awesome and definitely did not try to upsell me on unnecessary expensive pieces.   I think I spent an hour and a half in the store tops. And most of that time was just me being indecisive about things. It was such an easy process and my furniture was delivered 2 days later. The guys who delivered everything were efficient and able to get the couch through my narrow entryway without and scratches.   I'll definitely be back to this store because everyone was super friendly and the prices really can't be beat. I'm excited about my purchases and even sent my friend to the store and she got a couch too!

This place just opened up about a month ago and is right across the street from my office which is like a saving grace.   I was super bummed when our company moved from our office in Old Town to Skysong because there aren't a lot of good walking distance lunch options. But then Fate opened and it's definitely very much welcomed!  They hosted a happy hour for us last night and we were in the private back room which I didn't even know existed! Would be a cool spot for private parties for sure.   I've also been there a few times for lunch and their food is great. I've tried a few of the pizzas and something else that I can't remember but I definitely haven't been disappointed. I heard their grilled cheese is bomb.com so that's next on the list. I have a feeling the patio will packed when it isn't a million degrees out.   The location is slightly off the beaten path but it's worth it. I'm all about it.
