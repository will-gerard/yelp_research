Go here for happy hour... which I believe is until 6:30pm? Great deals on drinks and the food selection isn't too shabby either.   We (me & the  BF) ordered the chicken quesadilla per recommendation of the bartendress- great recommendation. That lil pocket of deliciousness is STUFFED with chicken and cheese plus you get all the naughty fixin's on the side (guac, sour cream, salsa...) as well.  All of the other food is still your standard, delicious Mexican... still very reasonably priced.  Ditching your vehicle is very convenient, plenty of parking in the back. Air conditioning is always 'full-blast.' Can order pitchers of margs frozen or on the rocks during happy hour.    Couldn't ask for more on a 115 degree day :)

Love the S-Bux. Would give this place FIVE stars since it does have expanded hours and ample seating accommodations BUT....  Parking here is terrible, awkward, and sometimes dangerous. When things get crazy in the am sometimes the drive-through line can actually gridlock patrons in the parking lot... hard to describe but once you see this place you will understand.  REALLY wish this place would go 24 hrs... its only closed for like 4-5 hours so why the heck not?!?!?!

Reeeeeally like this airport- probably the most efficient airport I've been to considering its size.  The lines for check in are very time-effective if not non-existent. Go upstairs and security is usually a breeze!  Yoshi's is delicious for quick, fast-food style asian cuisine ( Noodles with broccoli and chicken is da bomb!) Plus, you can access all of the other concourses and there is quite a few tequila hang-outs and sports bars along the way.  Only thing is parking is EXPENSIVE (went on a trip for 9 days = $90!) I guess most airports are but I'd recommend trying to use one of the remote parking lots (3rd party) or have a friend drop you off :)

Home Depot USUALLY rocks. I feel a personal responsibility to report my experience at this location.  Went to purchase some boxes and a dolly for a move I have coming up. Boxes- check. Dolly-check... wait a second!  Why is this thing wobbly and hard to pull?? OH, because there is a HOLE in the tire I could fit my FIST into!  This was probably due to the fact that Home Depot accepted a return from a customer that used or ABUSED this dolly. Either reject this person from making the return OR take your losses and demote this thing to be used on the floor. Do NOT try to resell it as NEW?!?  I posted a picture of this dolly, FYI, in case you can't believe what I'm saying.  Just a little advice, from now on I will be making sure my merchandise is NEW when shopping at this Home Depot and probably the other ones as well.

WAS expecting the deliciousness of In-N-Out times two plus the options of Five Guys.... NOPE. Pretty much glorified cafeteria food. Hard store-bought bun, white iceburg lettuce, and limp pickles.  No unusual hamburger combos (like blue cheese, arugula, etc). No juicy beef patty. No fresh, ripe ingredients. No like!  Plus the sodium on their fries is enough to cause a person to contract acute pitting edema :)  Why all the hype??

Pretty standard Starbucks. Friendly staff. Hot/ cold drinks....  Right next to Midwestern's campus and it closes at 9:30?!?! NINE THIRTY. Where the heck is the closest 24 hr Starbucks??!!

Ma and Pa restaurant on the middle of Bell? Pigs, cows, and 1950 are the only themes in this restaurant... a nice change from all of the generic chains that dominate Glendale. Did I mention they have deep-fried twinkies? Rattlesnake appetizer? Drool inducing BBQ sauce? Only negative is that the portions are very modest for an American diner. Definitely a down-to-earth BBQ place that is worth checking out.

Place is run by gossiping high-schoolers.  And what's even greater is you get to listen to all their petty drama while they hang out at the bar after their shift.  Name literally translates to "Garlic Al's" however its really named after a city in Arizona... not the herb, very disappointing.  Other then that, pretty standard Mexican.

I've been to this location 5 times and I'm yet to see the same special presented twice. They have them made up in the lobby area so you can see if they tickle your fancy.  The lunch portions are VERY generous and diverse (include miso soup, asian salad, crab rangoon, and the entree).  Also, if you like Kirin beer- every Kirin you order allows you to choose an appetizer add-on for $.50 - $1.00. There's seating at the bar, which surrounds the personable sushi chefs. And every meal is concluded with complementary orange pieces served with toothpicks.  Fresh wasabi upon request.

Merchandise and set up is Typical Aldo. Usually the staff at Aldo is annoyingly persistent about trying to get you matched up with a pair of shoes for $49... seems like ALL their shoes are $49....  Anyhoos, I had to track somebody down to assist me... then I had to persuade them to let me buy the shoes. If hadn't NEEDED these shoes I would have just gone to another shoe store.

Pretty much all nail salons in Arizona are pretty similar. Feet soak, scrubbed then painted. Not alot of attention to callouses and rough skin  included with the base price which is kind of BS... but like I said, that seems to be the standard in AZ.  What set this place apart for me is that she asked me WHY I was getting the pedi. I disclosed that I was departing shortly for a family trip to Hawaii and she suggested a FABULOUS festive nail idea.  I have attached a photo of this master piece for your viewing enjoyment :)

Blah to the extreme. The McRib at McDonalds is more flavorful and priced much more economically.  I ordered the surf and turf special. Steak volume was decent but there was TWO scallops. Wanted to complain but... where's the waitress?   It was also hard to cut my Medium-Rare steak with their DULL knives. Was like sawing through a brick with a chop stick. Boo!  PLUS it was irritating to wait for 40 minutes and then be seated in the far back... while passing dozens of empty tables along the way.  Thank goodness their liquid medication (martini) selection was decent. Maybe a good place for drinks??

It's an All American BBQ joint... with an adjunct, weekend Latino dance club.... Yeop.  What you MUST order:  Appetizer: Q- Roll Side: Mac n Cheese Main Dish: Anything  Alcoholic Beverage: Shipwrecked.... only need one for the WHOLE table  Try to sit outside, really nice atmosphere.  Fish Fry Fridays during Lent (comes with Two sides for $10.99)! And don't forget to tell the waiter about the Yelp 10% off Discount! AND you don't even need to order dessert because they give you FREE Cinnamon and Sugar Donut Holes!  Unusual thing is that on Friday and Saturday nights there's another side of the bar that opens into a club. Does NOT affect the dining experience.  Our Cabbie told us it was SUPER GHETTO, we'd probably be mauled immediately upon entrance, and possibly beat up by thugs- not the case. Very safe.

BEST LUNCH NEAR MIDWESTERN:  1. The food is extremely tasty  2. Lunch portions are perfectly sized.  3. They give 10% to students and faculty, make sure to bring your badge.  4. Every 9 lunches equals a free lunch.  5. Every meal comes with a beverage, make sure to ask for a "to-go" cup so you can take your drink to your afternoon classes

Sedona and Payson are beginning to tolerate other dogs thanks to THIS dog park. They're 5 month old rescue doggies and they were terrified of other dogs. It has been my experience that the dogs here are very playful, tolerant, and accepting of most any dog, even my puppies!  There's even a dog park click it seems, regulars that come just about everyday and let their dogs socialize together. Do NOT be intimidated, I wasn't. If you just grab an open chair and sit down they will soon engage you in the conversation.  I LOVE that there is GRASS! Can you believe it? And there is actually TWO separate dog parks. One for large (any) type of dog and another for ONLY small dogs. There is water available but it's a good idea to bring your own water container. All of the entrances/exits are double gated to prevent any wild pups from escaping.  It has been my experience at the small dog park that the owners are very diligent (and judgmental of others ;) about picking up pet's feces. It seems like there are more "land mines" in the 'large dog' area but this is probably because it is soooo much larger and it probably difficult to spot a hurried, squatting dog.  FYI: Beware though, I was told that a number of years ago there were people bringing their dogs to the dog park just to fight other dogs?!?!! I know terrible. BUT just like most circumstances in life, you must be AWARE of your surroundings and PAY ATTENTION to who is coming and going.   I have NOT had any problems personally and have REALLY enjoyed letting my doggies tire themselves out!

Discovered this gem on my peds rotation. Usually have 45 minutes for my lunch and cannot be late! This place is super speedy. Between being seated and walking out the door- done in 30 min, BOOM!  The lunch specials are definitely the best deal. Most food and variety for the best dollars spent.  They have all of your favorite Chinese classics. Casual. Dependable.

Movie theaters will never be the same!  I am not sure if all of theaters come standard with the reclining, magic chairs... But the one I sat in did! I was satisfied with the comfy accommodations long before I saw someone else utilize the "recline" function.... I used to think the chairs that slightly rocked were great...  The chairs and rows were clean and looked new. The staff was very pleasant. Standard concessions. Bathrooms were tidy and stocked. I also liked the ticket kiosks they have outside. No one seems to use them so it's a great way to bypass the lines.   A+!  Also convenient all of the surrounding restaurants to grab a bite before or after your show!

Had to give this place FIVE stars because it is IDEAL for a pre-game and post-game hang out.  It could basically be considered part of the ball park, it is that close. I got the Chicago dog... because the Cubbies were in town! Came out super fast and they even remembered the Celery Salt! A small detail that is usually overlooked by many restaurants.  Negatives, not a lot of options besides the standard beer and mixed drinks. No frozen Margs. No Mojitos... but whatever! I was able to get those drinks at Chase Field (def creep into the Club level at the Stadium- that's where the full-bar is kept secret!).  After the game its a full-blown beer garden with happy people talkin' smack in their huge outdoor seating area.  I will be going HERE before and hopefully after each game at Chase Field.

Was VERY pleasantly surprised with King's Fish House!   I was expecting this place to be very mediocre BUT I was in the mood for SEAFOOD so we wandered in...  We went later in the evening, around 8 o'clock or so and we could basically have our pick of the place. For your reading enjoyment, we settled on a booth :)  We ordered a sushi roll, the Rainbow Roll to be specific, and it was hands down the best Rainbow Roll I've ever had (and I've been around the block a couple times when it comes to sushi...). I usually put a touch of ginger on every roll I normally consume. This dining experience-ZERO ginger was used! There was no 'fishiness' to the fish and everything tasted so fresh.  We got the Clam Chowder too. AMAZING.   I got the Cioppino. Definitely a GREAT value for the money. The boyfriend got the Fish-n-Chips. The Fish-n-Chips were a little pricey for what was presented, but no real complaints.    For drinks I got a glass of red and the BF had two on-tap brews. The waiter clued us into a special that was going on at the time. Buy a $100 gift certificate and you received a $20 gift certificate complementary.  We were able to cover all that food, drink and tip with the $100 AND we have TWENTY dollars to go back again.  It's like they want to pay me to stuff my face. Thank you Mr. King Fish house :)

Lame-O! Many Nasties flock to this bar to... hang out ?  What is with this area of Glendale?!?  AT LEAST you can go with your own crowd of peeps and seclude yourself outside with a game of 'Bags' or 'Cornhole' or 'Beanbag Game.'

Glad I stumbled upon this place. There really aren't that many casual, unique restaurants downtown but this one, luckily, happened to catch my eye.  Real unassuming front, interior-  typical, gaudy Asian decorations BUT this place is MORE than your standard Thai food.  We were allowed to sit anywhere we'd like. Our server was immediately at our table. If anything, we had too much service! (Something I rarely ever complain about!)  Everything we ate had such fantastic balance in the flavor palate. It was a joy to taste so much delicious food.  I had the glass noodles with shrimp. Amazing.  The BF had the Drunken Noodles with chicken prepared spicy (you can request your desired level of spiciness). Since I didn't even get to sample any of his meal before he woofed it down, I'm going to assume he was well-satisfied with the dish.  Remember to leave room for dessert. So many Asian restaurants don't really offer dessert options BUT NOT Thai Elephant. They have quite a few delicious sounding sweet indulgences.   Next time I go I'm leaving room for dessert!

The atmosphere is "so-so" but the food is surprisingly delicious for the money. The chicken broccoli cheese pasta is light and flavorful. The goat cheese bruschetta is also worth checking out it you like earthy, acidic flavors. Lastly, the pizza is good but not amazing. The crust is VERY thin- almost cracker-like, would recommend as an appetizer. They also serve beer and wine which is a definite plus.

IF, you are 40-60 and looking for a "double-date" location, this is your venue.  It's awesome because it is located in Kierland Commons - an up-scale, outdoor, shopping district with plenty of places to spend a buck.   NoRTH has indoor sitting but it's absurdly noisy. Therefore, I would recommend the outdoor patio. Our waitress was amazing and on top of her tables. And for our Arizonian delight, they have outdoor heaters just in case the temperature should drop below 85 degrees. ;)  The trio of spreads appetizer was good (goat cheese=awesome, humus=great, olive spread= ehh?). I had the Buccatini (short ribs with tomato and pasta) for main course. Flavors were there but the presentation was not. The BF ordered the Grilled Ahi and I immediately had entree envy (seared but still very tender- I highly recommend). And if you like Tiramisu, order their Tiramisu.  All of that with a house bottle of Red, $90.

Driving 4 miles out of my way to go to THIS Starbucks. Why? Because THIS Starbucks is Larger, more table tops for homework, and open MUCH later than many of the Starbucks in the surrounding area.  I believe this was some sort of old Fast Food restaurant before... you can tell because the bathrooms are totally.... crappy :)  AND it is true what is written in some of the other reviews- this place spends a large fortune on the A/C... Brrrr! You can go sit in their outdoor area but there are misters out there and they will turn your pages all wavy. I say, bring a Northface and tough it out!

The food really is exceptional. Its like the chefs create these perfect little bites, and they literally are bites, of food that are so interesting to taste.  I'd recommend the sampler dinner. I want to say it runs about $40- $50 but its worth it as long as you like what's included.  IT IS EXPEN$IVE. BUT the BF and I have been dying to try out this restaurant due to all the rave reviews it has been receiving on Yelp. LUCKILY a Groupon appeared for NOCA and we jumped on the opportunity. Turned out the fab deal was only marginally helpful. Even with the Groupon it was still a $150 dinner (plus the cost of the groupon...).  Granted we did get a bottle wine (but the cheapest we could find), espresso and a french press cafe... It's like you analyze how much everything costs as you're ordering and are still shocked when the bill comes- I hate that.  Our reservation wasn't until 8:30pm at night, no big deal. The restaurant was still PACKED! AND people kept coming through the door!  It is not a large venue. And the tables are CRAMMED, uber close together. I know that the four-some sitting next to us are going to Isreal next month, right after their family vacation to Minnesota....

***Appetizer: Pineapple Poke!  I have actually dreamed about this dish- that resulted in me returning just to savor the delicious tuna creation.  Both times I have gone I have just shared an assortment of appetizers... because they're so good! I'm looking forward to returning in the near future. Perhaps I will advance to an actual entree??!  My BF loves the assortment of Micro brews on tap and they're served by very personable staff-complimentary.  There is ALWAYS a wait after sporting events so I'd recommend sneaking out of the game early to grab a spot or weather the wait while sipping your favorite cocktail at the bar and hope to snag someones spot.

NEBRASKA FANS UNITE!!!  This place is straight legit NE. Best place to watch CREIGHTON & Husker games as this place is owned by the same midwest family that owns the Clancys' locations in Omaha.  There's a group of Creighton alumni that get together for most of the basketball games... a rare finding in the wild wild southwest.  Parking is a kind of a problem in this strip mall.... so be prepared to circle the lot a few times~!

Soooooo gym expectations have flourished over the past few years and THIS LA Fitness is waaaay behind.  I have been so MANY LA Fitnesses and it seems like they have either been recently updated or they are from 1991. This one is from 1985. I don't know that that is an actual fact but it just seems like it :)  It is so hot in Arizona. The last thing you want to do it go work out where it is 90 degrees... but that's exactly what you'll get at this facility. Before you even begin your workout you will be sweating. It is a gym so I guess this is acceptable but there are some nasty smelling people and the moist, stagnant air really isn't helping anything.  I will most likely continue to go to this location just because it is so close to mi casa but I wish I didn't have to  :(

Considering what is considered the 'norm' for workout facilities... this place is WAY behind the times.  This place would be amazing for 1952- it would then be considered clean, tidy, and cutting edge. There are some actual perks about this place- they do have daycare and plenty of mirrors for me to watch my fat jiggle while I run on the treadmill ;)  It's just an utter disaster. When the BF and I originally signed up, we got a couples membership at a newly redone Glendale location and it was worth the monthly membership fee.  This place does not need a 'face-lift.' It needs to be gutted and TOTALLY renovated. You just feel a nasty moistness when you walk in the door- which just gets worse the longer you're there... and is even MORE WORSE during the summer. Guys always have the weight benches dominated. There's never any availability for machines (any kind) from 4-7:30pm, then it starts to thin out. Blah bla bla blah bla.  Considering this is the "Biltmore" location... huge disappointment. Fact.

A pitiful representation of the other McFaddens that spot the country. At CHICAGO's McFadden one can dance on the counter top, bargain shots with the bartender, and dance to Journey until you slip on the beer-slicked floor....  NOT the case at Glendale's pathetic "irish pub" creation. The happy hour is the ONLY time worth going to this establishment. Any other time is a WASTE of your time. I literally wasted a whole hour at McFadden's watching a tramp-stamp competition at 10:30pm on a Saturday...  The bathrooms are nasty. The music is the worst... usually just techno and trance crap that is NON-danceable!  Additionally, there is no dancing allowed on the counter-tops...WTF.

Sometime you just NEED A FREAKIN' HOT DOG! And this would be the place to go to satisfy the urge.  The atmosphere is simple and the seating is somewhat limited, probably not the best selection for your wedding reception BUT it definitely will pace as a great joint to hang out at when you just want to be laid back.  They also have a great assortment of french fries and other snack. When I went they actually had these items cooked up and set out for demo- me likes.  I was disappointed in the 'Chicago dog' though. It really doesn't follow the blueprint for a TRUE Chicagodog and should therefore be termed the "Chicago dog" or the Chicago-esk dog.... Guess I need to head to Wrigley to get one of those, darn ;)

Meeh. For some reason this place always looks full... It's ok.  Typical, trendy Scottsdale bar... just like the typical Snotsdale guys with designer jeans, Affliction shirts, pointy leather shoes and large belt buckles.  This is a place you can go, look cute and have skee-zoids buy you free drinks all night- but that is all. Can't dance crazy, get freaky on the bar top... or even LAUGH.   The people here ARE pretentious and they would JUDGE you if you tried ANY of the above.  We had a few drinks here, got bored, and went somewhere else..

Well... Richard was very generous with his 3 stars. Truth is, this place ONLY stays in business because there is NOWHERE else to go in Historic Florence, Arizona.  Went here for a Groupon package deal... everyone in the restaurant was there for the same reason. I overheard the people next to us inquire as to where their food was since they had been waiting 30 minutes. The waiter replied, "Oh, I think it might still be FROZEN. Let me check, I'll have it right out."  FROZEN??!?! I guess its a decent solution for an empty restaurant to be able to serve a variety of foods- since it really would be expensive to prepare everything fresh everyday and have no one to service it to...  But don't admit this aloud.   Advice to ALL restaurants: At least pretend like your food is fresh. :)

WhatsaMATTA wit chu?!?  Had to write that... Now, on to business.   I have absolutely no complaints about Mattas. Was on my way to grab a matinee viewing of a movie at Cinemark and this restaurant could not be any more convenient.   There's a slight price reduction for 'happy hour' on the combos. $1,$2, and $3 for combos 1,2, and 3, respectfully.  I got the 2 combo with my choice of cheese enchilada and pork tamales. The cheese had amazing oooey-gooeyiness. The pork tamales was done well but it is spicy. If you don't like spicy, I would not get this.  The portions were huge and the food came out right away. There were chips and salsa while I waited (2 different salsas... I liked the chunky one!).   Very standard Mexican preparation.  I would very much like to return to this fine establishment!

This place is my NEW FAVORITE place to dine in Phoenix. The food is delicious and guilt-free. The staff at Seasons 52 guarantee that every meal is under 500 Calories... I'm sold!  The whole menu changes four times per year... with the seasons... ;) and there is a side menu that changes every week.... hence the "52."   I had scallops with asparagus. They were perfectly cooked and I knew I could eat the whole meal without reservation because it was within my daily caloric intake :) But then again we had to get an appetizer (their cheese breads are like flat pizzas) and dessert!  This is now THE place I recommend to out of town guests and to the boyfriend for date night.

Whaaaa??!?! Free Miso soup and salad?!! I will have to remember that next time I go... were not offered to me :( I guess those are perks that must be specifically requested....  I DID Order the shrimp tempura and a few rolls. They came out Super fast. It was like a quarter before 5 and there was no one else in the restaurant...  I was surprised by this as they have a pretty decent happy hour and it is in effect 7 days a week!  The staff is very Friendly. The items are well priced. And overall, the whole place felt very Clean.   Will definitely go back ~ A nice change from all those huge sushi chains.

HUGE portions. AMAZING salsas (especially the green...). FISHBOWL-SIZED margaritas. Menu contains all of the Mexican essentials- but nothing innovative or unique. We had a great service experience and definitely plan on returning.

Such a subjective topic to Yelp about- but to score a "First," I will do it.  Currently, I am a student and it has been amazing to live so close to school but yet be able to leave the campus every day.  Several of my classmates live on-campus and  have to be 'at school' 24 hrs a day....  For perspective apartment seekers- I'd say 70%, if not more, are Midwestern students. I'd consider this a plus because we are all a bunch of book nerds trying to get through school so we are very QUIET. Additionally, we don't want to get into trouble so we are very reluctant to vandalize, steal, or liter on premise. :)  I have Loved having all my appliances "in-unit" (having moved from Chicago, W/D in-unit was a myth to behold), zero-entry (pool has a sand bar that you can pull a recliner onto, have your feet in the water, and study Biochem all at the same time), and the Price. I have a two-bedroom and pay $950.   The staff is pretty normal. They do the courteous, hand-waive-salute thing when you drive by. They are really great at getting any complaints or broken things dealt with in a timely manner. San Lagos does host a few parties throughout the year with an open bar and free food which is pretty tight.  I have also been fortunate to have a view that faces one of the several ponds. There is the potential to have a hideous view of Home Depot and the rest of 'that' strip mall. There are also a few resident ducks that waddle around and add a little character to the grounds.  As I approach rotations I am considering moving- only because most of my rotations are scheduled at the VA, AZ Heart, etc. and are located in downtown Phoenix. Also, I'm considering getting a doggy and San Lagos prohibits dogs. I believe they allow cats... but WHO wants one of those?!? ;)  BUT I really hate moving so who knows.

Came here on a Monday- BONUS- it's trivia night!  The hubby found this killer find next to our hotel. Lots and lots of brews on tap! They bold and italicize the local ones to make it easy to discover new favorites.  Our party of four sat at the corner of the bar and was indulging in beer and appetizers. I have a new favorite, Hanger 24. A local wheat beer that is phenomenal. We ordered the pretzel with mustard- very tasty but nothing crazy. The brisket nachos did not quite live up to my expectations but I would order and eat them again. I can't articulate why they were kinda 'meh,' but they were.  The trivia game was a real game changer. Suddenly tons of people started pouring into the establishment, eager to snatch a seat... And no one left until a victor was made. This was around 10pm and then it was just us again. Strange but true.   We ended up scoring below 3rd place...  We were in first before that third round of brewskis...
