OMG OMG OMG Korean BBQ!  This is the first place I ever tried any sort of Korean BBQ and it's by far my favorite.  I think based on the fact that everyone else in the restaurant except for my wife and son were speaking Korean that this is a pretty authentic place.  Oh, and the menu is mostly in Korean too, and even the parts that are English don't really make much sense and some of the descriptions are horrifying to my uneducated ignorant eyes (you'll know when you see them).  Fortunately there's lots of pictures and I picked the simple Chicken BBQ plate and whooo boy it's super awesome fantastic.  The serving staff all speak English and are really helpful in telling you what is what, but all you need to know is to order BBQ Chicken, Pork or Beef and you'll be happy.    After ordering the server will bring over 8 or 9 little dishes each filled with some sort of Korean appetizer.  There's lots of Kim Chi which I'm told is excellent, but I'm a coward.  The potatoes, though were excellent as were several other things that I tried.  If you finish any of the little bowls you can ask for more at no charge.    When the meal comes out you're in a for a great treat!  Each plate comes out sizzling like when you get fajitas.  They're piled high (really high) with your choice of seasoned meat and onions.  And they also give you a big bowl of rice.    Each bite is heaven.  Oh man, just thinking about it right now just before lunch is driving me insane.  I think I'm going to have to drag Lindsay down there tomorrow night.  We love bringing our friends here.  Hodori is tucked away in a strip mall full of other Asian stores and restaurants.  Its decor is blah, but the staff is nice.  If you're not Korean, don't be surprised if you're the only non-Korean there.  I can't wait to go back.  I must go back.

Sea Saw is the home to my best meal ever.  The combination of Japanese-inspired tapas plus an uber-awesome bottle of sake recommended by Nobu created the best tasting evening I've ever had.  My wife and I have eaten at Sea-Saw twice now and we are counting the days until we can come back.  It's absolutely 100% fantastic and a great experience in every way.  I think the other reviews pretty much have it nailed so I won't make this one too long.  It's great.  Save your pennies and go have an awesome night out.  Ask Nobu-san to recommend a bottle of sake and take a taxi home!  Don't forget to get reservations!  We lucked up on our second visit on a weeknight, but it's such a tiny place that you'll want to call ahead.

Four stars for the lunch-time buffet.  My team at lunch likes to eat here for lunch sometimes and I have to say it's pretty great for lunch.  The buffet is much smaller than your typical Chinese buffet place, but everything in it is much higher quality.  The dish with the fried fish is super-duper great.  G&S has better-than-average atmosphere for a Chinese restaurant and their wait staff is attentive and fun.  George himself is often there as well.  My family has eaten here a few times for dinner as well.  I can't give G&S 4 stars for dinner, but I'd definetly give it 3.5 if I could.  The portions are pretty big, the food is tasty, and the menu has a lot of stuff in it.  I'm not sure how authentic G&S is, but I think it's one of the best places for Chinese lunch buffet in this part of Scottsdale.

This is one of the very few food places near where we live.  While it's not a particularly great pizza place, it's not bad either.  There are tables inside and the staff is generally friendly.  They have a nice-sized LCD on one wall where patrons can watch whatever game is on.  The pizza is serviceable, though not remarkable.  They serve lunch and have quite a few specials.  We probably get pizza from here once or twice a month.

This is one of my favorite lunch places, and they've recently improved!    The wife and I stopped by here today for lunch and I was impressed with a new menu.  They're offering pizza now and for the first time I noticed that you can get an Italian Sausage Parm Hero.    That's what I got and it was SO good!    The same guys run the place, but they've ramped up their friendly service to an even higher plateau.  One of the owners was greeting every group of customers as they came in and the staff was doing a great job finding tables, etc for the huge lunch crowd that was coming in.  This is bare bones, fantastic Italian lunch food.  Not a place to go on a date, but a place to get an extremely satisfying lunch during your busy day.  I highly recommend stopping by, eating lunch and saying hello to the boys!

This is NOT a Japanese restaurant.  I wouldn't eat the sushi here - not saying that it isn't safe, but the tuna rolls I had (just about the simplest thing to make) weren't tasty at all.  I would best describe this place as "Asian Inspired."  It's a real hodge-podge of food styles and you KNOW you're in trouble when your "Asian" restaurant has a section in the menu for "Sandwiches."  Ugh.  I guess I'm being kind of snobbish, but if I'm going to pay $8 for sub-standard tuna rolls then I think I have a right to be.  Our total for 2 adults and one kids meal was $60 including drinks.  I would have been perfectly satisfied with the visit if the check had been half as much.  As is usual for North Phoenix/Scottsdale/Cave Creek restaurants they way overspent on decor and ambiance and totally scrimped on food quality.    This is a very bland place full of uninteresting food.

Yasu has quickly become my favorite Japanese restaurant in town.  The first time we ate there, my wife and I had the sashimi lunch plate.  I was totally blown away by the quality of the hamachi.  Absolutely the freshest yellowtail I've had in Phoenix.  Since then, we've eat there several more times for lunch and three times at dinner and every time it's been incredibly good.  Just the simple tuna roll is the best I've had in Phoenix also.  Super fantastic food.  As for price - any good sushi restaurant is going to be expensive, but we've spent as much or more at lesser quality restaurants like Sakana.  Also, $1.50 for soda nowadays is fantastic.  And, having Echigo beer is a definite plus.  Yasu has a great atmosphere, though I wish they had a longer sushi bar where you could watch the chefs do their thing.  We regularly bring our 11-year-old son who loves sushi and that's no problem.  The noise level is acceptable, though expect long waits if you show up on a weekend night without reservations.  If you like Sushi at all, please make your way to Yasu - it's well worth almost any drive.  I can't wait to go back!

My favorite North Scottsdale drinkin' place.  You can't beat $3 Harps.  I'm a huge fan of the food too!  I love the standard stuff like the Fish and chips and the Beef Stew, but the Salmon Entree is fantastic!    Make sure that if it's an option on any meal that you order that you get the Scalloped Potatoes.  They're extra yummy.  Very nice, relaxed casual atmosphere.  Lots of seating space.  Huge projected screen for watching sports.  A few cute waitresses.  Yummy beer.  Overall a great place to hang out and have a few drinks or dinner.  And like other people have mentioned it's an older crowd (meaning generally over 30) which is perfect for me.  :D

I needed new tires for my Acura TL this weekend as I'll be driving the car to California soon.  I called around to several local tire shops, and none of them had the right size in stock.  I did some research on TireRack.com and decided on a brand and style of tire and decided to call a couple more places to see if I could find just what I wanted.  I called Discount Tire.  They had the exact tires I wanted in stock and could install them on the same day.  Dude gave me a quote over the phone and I made an appointment.  He told me they'd have me in and out in 45 minutes.  When we got there for the appointment, they had the tires, they were the exact price quoted and they did get me out in 45 minutes.  Can't really get much better than that!

Best damned Lasagna in Scottsdale, and probably in Phoenix-Metro.  I think the secret is the sauce - same sauce that goes onto their awesome spaghetti.  Really, really good.  This is by far the best little pizza joint I've visited.    The pizza's pretty good too, but for goodness sake, eat the lasagna!!

We've eaten at Taneko twice now, and while we like it, it's awful expensive for what you get, and I prefer a more authentic Japanese environment.  Taneko starts off wanting to be a Japanese-style pub restaurant, but ends up throwing way too much Scottsdale into it creating a rather pretentious yet still yummy restaurant.  The food is excellent - I enjoy the pork meal that has the stupidly spicy mustard sauce.  My kid likes the fried rice, though it is a little too much on the ginger side.  There's a gimmicky hot-rock appetizer where you cook pieces of steak on a super hot rock.  It's way too expensive for what little meat you get, but it's an awful lot of fun.  The service is excellent as well, though maybe a little too servile for my tastes.  The wait staff go WAY out of their way to make you comfortable and quickly take care of any needs.  I just don't care for all of the introductions - I'm not going to remember the names of the 4 or 5 people bringing me stuff.  Still, I think that's the Scottsdale influence.  Not bad, but not really my thing.  Overall, I've enjoyed both of the meals that I ate at Taneko, but with better places to eat real Japanese food like Yasu, Sea Saw, Hiro's and even Sakana, I'm probably not going back real soon.

We've used Pet Butler for the last year or so and we've been 100% satisfied with the service. We have two dogs, so we have them come out once a week to pick up after them. Absolutely no complaints at all. The guy that comes out always does a very thorough job. I 100% recommend these guys to anyone who has dogs and a fenced in yard!

My friend Joy Li has her store here at The Mix.  My wife and I built her website for her.  http://www.joyli.net  This may be VERY Scottsdale, but all of the store owners and employees are really nice people.  We came at the big opening event and had a really nice evening.    My wife has some of Joy's clothing and she looks stunning in them.  Check out her shop and tell her Terry and Lindsay sent yoU!

We ate here last night and really enjoyed it.  We'll be adding Ling and Louie's to our restaurant rotation.  Think of this place as a step up from Pei Wei and you'll be just about right on the money.  We started with the potstickers which were definitely better than what you get at Pei Wei.  My wife had the meat loaf which I tasted - it was excellent.  I had the sizzling chicken and pork which was also quite good.  She had a Mai Thai and I had Kirin Ichiban draft.  Both drinks were great.  Fun atmosphere.  Casual.  We sat next to the kitchen and really enjoyed the smells.  Cons:  The fried rice wasn't anything special, though it was ok.  The brown rice wasn't *good* brown rice - was dry.  Next time I think we'll be happy with the white rice.  If you're sick of the same few places like we are, and you're looking for something a bit nicer than Pei Wei with full wait service, a full bar and better food, this is a great spot.  The prices are a bit more than Pei Wei as well, but not much.  I'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes.

We've used Camelback Moving twice in the past month during a hectic move from one house to another.  In both cases we had fantastic experiences.  The three man crews moved our heaviest stuff so much faster than we ever could have.  Paying by the hour instead of by weight makes everything a lot more affordable as well.  No complaints at all.  We will be using Camelback Moving the next time we move!

If I could I'd give Blowfish 2.5 stars.    We ate here on Thursday, June 19th 2008.  We sat at a teppan table.  Amongst my wife and kid we had shrimp, chicken, NY Steak, and calamari.  We paid a total of around $95 before tips for dinner plus 2 soft drinks a bottle of warm sake and a beer.  First the nice stuff.  Blowfish is brand new and the owners went all out with the decoration.  It's a nice looking place with 5 or 6 teppan tables, a long sushi bar and a good number of dining tables.  There's also a very nice looking patio in the back.  It looks like Blowfish was designed to appeal to and cater to the wealthy in the far north valley.  My wife's sake was very good for warm sake - definitely not the cheapest stuff.  My Sapporo came out super cold, severed in a chilled glass.  The wait staff was very friendly, attractive and professional.  The teppan chefs all seemed very professional and very skilled, but that's about where the good stuff ends.  The rest wasn't bad - just not at all impressive.  We ordered 2 orders of tuna rolls.  They were just a bit below average.  The tuna wasn't particularly fresh.  If Yasu's tuna rolls are a 10, these were a 4, maybe.  Like I said, the teppan chef was great.  I'm just afraid he was given mediocre ingredients.  The shrimp was just ok.  I expected calamari steak when I ordered, but instead he cooked the suckers, etc that you get when you order a calamari appetizer at an Italian restaurant.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't awesome like a good calamari steak.  The NY steak was ok.  Not great and not bad.  The chicken breast looked pretty pathetic.  It was probably the saddest looking chicken I've ever seen on a teppan grill.  It wasn't gross or rotten or bad - it was just cheap.  I paid $17 for my kid's chicken plate and they cooked him a $2 chicken breast.  In summary, Blowfish looks like a Japanese restaurant that someone threw a LOT of money at.  They have Japanese teppan chefs and the sushi bar was at least staffed with a bunch of Japanese looking chefs (I didn't get to listen to them talk).    The problem is they've scrimped horribly on the quality of their food.  If places like Yasu, and even Sakana can procure and prepare decent quality food, then Blowfish should be able to as well.  Other than its location way far in the north valley there is nothing else to distinguish Blowfish as a good or interesting Japanese restaurant.

5-Stars for the best Soul Food in the Valley!  I'm from the Deep South (Mississippi), and I've been craving soul food for years, so when a group of friends suggested we eat at Lo Lo's yesterday, I couldn't say no!  The Lo Lo's in Scottsdale is a nice, open restaurant that was VERY crowded at 2PM on Saturday afternoon.  Every group had a wait of at least 20 minutes.    I had the special which included two pieces of fried chicken - a breast and a wing - a waffle with syrup and I ordered a side of cheese grits.  First, the waffle.  No one at waffles with fried chicken in Mississippi.  I think this soul food extension is an invention of Chicago, though I may be wrong.  The waffle was tasty, but nothing spectacular.  It was aight.  The chicken, though, was by far the best damned fried chicken I've had since I ate at a family-owned Cajun fried chicken place in Gonzales, Louisiana 15 years ago.  It was THAT good.  Generous pieces.  Fried to perfection.  The grits: these were REAL grits.  Not instant.  The good stuff.  The kind that takes a good while to cook.  It was perfect.  Man, I haven't had honest good grits in more than 15 years.  We'll be going back to Lo Los just because of grits if nothing else (though I really want more chicken).  Everyone's drinks came in gigantic glass mayonnaise jars.  Not too many of us needed refills.  A friend ordered fruit punch kool-aid (which they have ON TAP).  I could SMELL his kool aid from across the table.  He sad it was so strong, he probably went home with diabetes.  :D  They don't fool around with their kool-aid.  Service was fantastic.  Our waiter had an awesome shirt that said "Scottsdale, but Hood forever"  lol  We'll be going back as soon as we recover.  :D

Service: 5 stars! Best waiter we've had in Phoenix in a while. Also, the happy hour margarita was one of the best I've had in the Valley.  Every person from the valet to the hostess to the guy who drove us back to the valet in a golf cart was incredibly nice.  Ambiance: 5 stars! Wonderful gem of a restaurant. Not too crowded, not over themed. Just right. Elegant without too much pretension.  Food: 4 stars - excellent food, very well prepared, decent sizes, but it didn't blow either of us away.    Price - surprisingly decent for a fancy restaurant with 3 drinks between the two of us.  I wouldn't call it inexpensive or affordable, but I was surprised that we didn't pay much more!  The five star review is mostly for the service. I can't say enough good things about how warmly we were welcomed.  We'll be back for sure!

We ate here last night to celebrate our 16th anniversary.  I used open table to set up the reservation and also ordered flowers through FlowerPetal.  Eddie V's set up the roses and made a rose petal heart around the vase.  :)  We both had the filet mignon which were cooked perfectly to medium rare.    Our waiter, Brian, was attentive, helpful and professional.  He helped suggest a wine that suited both of us perfectly.  Get the banana Foster butter cake.  OMG it was AWESOME.  Dude.  The manager also stopped by our table and wished us a happy anniversary and stayed and chatted for a few minutes.  Every time we've been to Eddie V's we've been treated like VIPs.  We love it!

When I made our reservation, I jokingly added a note that my wife and I were celebrating our 16.5 wedding anniversary.  Eddie V's, though, took it seriously and pulled out all the stops - rose petals on our table, signed Happy Anniversary card, and free dessert.  I mentioned several times that it wasn't really our anniversary, but they would hear nothing about that!  LOVED IT!  We will be going back as often as we can!

We ate here on September 8 to celebrate my wife's birthday, and I have to say this was, without doubt, one of the best meals we've ever had in the Phoenix area!  We were lucky enough to get a seat at the chef's counter and got to watch the masters at work.  We both ordered the 4 course omokase meal and let the chef decide what we'd have.  We also shared a bottle of amazing sake.  1st course - white fish carpaccio - OMG delicious!  2nd course - trio of tuna sashimi salad(?): sashimi with pine nuts, oyster with sea urchin,  forgot the third piece :(  But it was all fantastic!  I was a bit scared of the oyster/urchin but it was AMAZING.  3rd course - washu style beef - we grilled the beef on a hot rock.  Was delicious!  4th course - the best damned nigiri sushi either of us have ever had!!  OH MAN!  This was almost worth the full cost of the dinner.  I've never had any sushi come close.  Unbelievable.  We also had a complimentary japanese custard desert that was also outstanding.  The service was perfect.  The atmosphere is super high end Japanese - simple, zen, wood, cool.  Classical music played.    This was also one of our most expensive meals here in the Phoenix area.  Pricier than Mastro's even, but it was worth every last penny.  Dinner could have been considerably less expensive if we'd tried one of their rare Japanese beers instead of the sake, but we were really happy with the sake.  For the money, this place is worth 6 Yelp stars if that was possible.  I haven't eaten at Nobu-san's followup to Sea Saw, but Shinbay was at least as good as Sea Saw if not better, so it may well now be the best Japanese place in the Valley.

We've eaten here twice - once for lunch and once for dinner.  The food is very tasty and the service was fine.  The place is certainly a welcome addition to an area chock-full of boring, regular ole Scottsdale restaurants.  If I could give 3.5 stars, I would, though since the restaurant was completely dead each time we've gone and the food, while quite delicious seemed overpriced.  We would go back to eat more often if the food was 15-20% less expensive and it would be even nicer if more people visited.

We used Tru Cab last night to take us to our 16th anniversary celebration dinner and back home.  I used their website to schedule the pickup and they communicated with me and helped make sure we had a great night.  The cab was clean.  Our driver was awesome.  Nicest taxi service I've used in Phoenix.  We will be using them again in the future!

This was my best lunch in any airport restaurant ever. I had the rotisserie chicken with cannoli beans and green beans (the veggie of the day).   Both the green beans and the cannoli beans were cooked perfectly. The broth in the beans was savory with a hint of lemon. The chicken itself was exactly as moist and tender as you could want from rotisserie chicken. The entire meal was delicious.  I was also surprised to see that their pretty short beer list had some really interesting choices! I really enjoyed my Belgian Karmeliet Tripel. It was quite tasty and potent. The wine list also looked small, but interesting.  I think I heard my waitress say it was her first day at Chelsea's, but if so they did a great job in bringing her in. She was perfectly attentive and knew exactly when to stop by the table. She also told me about the free chocolate chip cookies that are available on the way out.  Before tip, my lunch came to $30. Not at all cheap, but worth every penny, especially  after a week of poor business travel eating.  If you're flying any of the airlines out of Terminal 4, check your bags and grab a bite to eat at Chelsea's!
