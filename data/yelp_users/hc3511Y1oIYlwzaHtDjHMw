Food was unimpressive, but the staff was even worse. Poor attitudes, no smiles, drive through guy was very rude and made everything feel rushed. Way to welcome your customers

Food was great, unfortunately the service was pretty terrible. Our server never introduced himself, greeted us with "can I get you a drink?" Pace of service was very slow, which we understand that he might be busy, but it wouldn't hurt to smile and be kind to us. So if that's the experience you want, come eat at Valle Luna Phoenix!

Went in as a new customer to this location, asked for a simple men's short crew cut, barber acts like I'm inconvenient and does a half ass job cutting. I had told the guy I wanted it shorter and he just smirked. Looked like shit when I left so I just went home and fixed it myself, but I still tipped the guy $7, hope he learns to put in honest hard work. This location wasn't even busy, and now I can see why. Shit quality! Won't be coming to this location again.

Service sucks, and the bartenders have shit attitudes. Food is good, and love the games and billiards. I guess bring ten of your drunk buddies, maybe they'll acknowledge you as paying customers then. Bottom line: Don't come here for good, friendly, welcoming service.
