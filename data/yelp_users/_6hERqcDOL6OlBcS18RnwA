First off I would like to say that the overall layout of the restaurant is appealing, very cleanly, seating arrangement isn't too close together and depending on the weather the patio is always nice. The staff at this location is always very helpful and friendly, ordering online for this location is always awesome because your food is waiting for you when you get there. I know it's a minute detail but the front desk set up was a nice touch as well, makes it fairly easy and efficient to get people seated or on their way with a takeout order.  If I had to suggest anything as far as food goes, Thai Dynamite Steak Wok, Steam it, Extra Spicy and Extra Vegetables. Couple with an order of the Chicken Salad rolls or Crab Wantons always work! Don't be afraid to grab a handful of fortune cookies, the staff here won't judge you, they just turn a blind eye to your addiction.. ;D

I've been going here for a good while now and can honestly say I haven't had a bad experience as far as the service or drinks were concerned, tuesday nights are always entertaining, but the weekend is obviously where it's at.  Food is great and the drinks are moderately priced, the selection is always top notch. The general layout and decor of the bar is amazing, though I tend to find myself at the bar for the most part.

Wow.. The service here is deplorable, I don't know if I've ever been so disrespected  before at any bar. One of the bartenders spilled a bottle of j√§ger and doused me with some booze without so much as an apology. Not to mention it took maybe 12-15 minutes just to get a beer after sitting down at the bar.. The only thing that brings me back here is that I have no choice with the lack of arcades for the kids.. Once again, poor service from a poor location.

Went into this particular branch for the first time, mostly because of the convenience, being located near the on/off ramps to the Loop 101. Initially found the atmosphere pleasant due to overall cleanliness and presentation but, then I decided to interact with the employees there. The teller that helped me came off as rude, abrasive and ignorant of the idea that their job is to relay a good customer service experience while helping me with my request.  Needless to say I won't be coming back here anytime soon and was happy when my business had concluded, left more annoyed than anything else.

I've been to a lot of comic book shops in my life and I can easily say this is by far the best comic shop thus far. From the moment you walk in, the staff greets with a warm welcome, to the time that you leave after shaking your hand and sending you back out into the world better equipped to "geek out". The inventory is most impressive and anything that you can't find? Well, just ask the knowledgeable staff and they will be happy to help you in your quest to find that particular rarity that you're after. Need a drink? They've got that too, coffee, slushies, soda etc. The lounge area is by far one of the best attributes in the store, if you have some time, sit down and unwind reading a few new titles, you just might find a new line for yourself to enjoy!    Comics, graphic novels, action figures, games, just about anything your heart may desire, they have it.

A first time customer I recently had one of the best experiences in a long time as far as haircuts go, I should mention I had not cut my hair for five years. Referred to by a friend I entered Brush, a very comfortable, personal environment and sat down with Brynne Dubin. Needless to say I won't be going anywhere else anytime soon! It was a great experience, cut, style, even if you need a quick trim on your beard/stache, I would recommend Brush and Brynne Dubin.
