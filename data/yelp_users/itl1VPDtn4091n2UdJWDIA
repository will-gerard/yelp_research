I love this place!!!! I moved here just over a year ago with my kia and they've acted like I bought it here to begin with. A+service!!! I got an insane quote for brakes at a local tire place a year ago (who also put the fear of God in me by telling me I'd die if I didn't get new brakes THAT DAY along with rotors i would die on the way home. The perk of being assumed to be a dumb female) I took myself over to mark kia where Brandy took me into the garage and explained to me what needed to be done by pointing out the problems (which were not immediately dangerous). I scheduled my appointment and got new brakes (and not rotors because they weren't needed!) For less than half of the other place! I have since brought my car in about 4 times and always experience the top notch service, reasonable prices (not just for a dealership but for anywhere in the area!) and enjoy the Starbucks coffee in the lobby. I wouldn't willingly bring my car anywhere else at this point.  Thank you , Mark Kia, for the superb service!

I thought I was alone in my negative experience with Dr Henry but clearly not! Prior to visiting this office, I had an inconclusive melanoma in situ biopsy on my knee that resulted in surgery with a bunch of other suspicious moles on my body. I went to Dr Henry because my previous dermatologist was no longer covered with my insurance and I wanted my moles mapped and a couple biopsies of moles that had changed recently. He did a quick skimming over my body, no mapping and no pictures of moles for comparison at the next visit. I had to coax him to biopsy 2 moles that had changed drastically, where as he preferred to wait it out for 6 months (after 1 cancer scare I refuse to wait anything out). I told him anything that looks suspicious cut it off (in a joking tone, but seriously. I joke when I'm nervous)! And he told me I was being inapporpriate. Um. OK ease up buddy. You're the one who's about to cut into me. So bedside manner is non existent and he really didn't take time with me to do a proper cancer screening. You should see a trend in these reviews and find someone who is actually concerned with your health.

I was turned away from Walgreens take care clinic after waiting over an hour to see seen for a small infected cat bite. (They dont treat animal bites, just insect bites. Good to know AFTER waiting..)I was in and out of nextcare within a half hour with an antibiotic prescription and no unneeded drama.

I was skeptical of Lucilles being just another fake bbq joint and it took me over 2 years to get around to going. Wow! So surprised by how delicious it was! Cheesy grits were so good! Best biscuits, great bbq sauce selections (my favorite was the hottest!) We had the beef brisket and southern fried chicken sandwich. It was enough food for 3 adults, a baby and leftovers for lunch the next day. It is quite possibly the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The only thing i wouldn't suggest was the fries. Shoestring fries don't do it for me. Service was friendly and the ambience was charming. I'd definitely go back!

Went here to have my shellac removed but didn't care for for manicure because I'm going home to clean my house. Manicurist did not seem happy I didn't care for mani and used the drill to remove shellac, scratching my nails. I asked if she could use the "shine" side of the sponge thing  to smooth out the top of my nails and she said she'd charge me $5 for that . So I left with gritty dull sandpaper textured nails with scratches on them. I know I was a "small job", but when I choose to get shellac again (as soon as tomorrow) I will not bring my repeat business here.

Everything was sooooo good! Panang curry with chicken, mango sticky rice and crab wontons! The wontons were super crispy and not doughy. Just a thin wrapper! MUST HAVE!

I just moved here a few months ago from chicago and have been craving a big awesome burrito like the ones back home.. filled with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, meat, maybe some guac all rolled up in a tender tortilla...mmmm....big glass of horchata...  ...I was not expecting this taco bell sized burrito stuffed with nothing except for the meat I ordered. A little lettuce and whiteish red tomato on the side was all I had to pretend it was veggie stuffed. :-( and to think I passed up the delicious shrimp tacos at rubios for this? AND paid over $7 for this :'( no bueno.

Cautionary tale to follow when I have more time...but do not trust them with your ac install! I have had 3 ac professionals check out farnsworth's install and they're all appalled and say it's companies like this one that gives them all a bad rep. Communication is terrible as well and i have been waiting a week to hear back from the owner/manager but am giving up hope because I wouldn't trust them to do it right anyways.  Fixing their crap install will cost me around $2000. Terrible company.

My friend got a cold pressed coffee. Good flavor but no almond milk offered? Just soy and cows milk. I find that odd. Also, no stevia or raw sugar. Probably would never go back

I have now been to Sunny's Diner 4 times in the last month and I cannot say enough good things about it! The biscuits are completely heavenly and a great alternative to a toast as a side. I have gotten the Greek Skillet twice and I am so in love! It is not greasy like you would think it would be and the homemade tzatziki sauce is fresh and delicious. Today I got a side of chocolate chip pancakes with my Greek Skillet. Yum! My friends have gotten biscuits and gravy and eggs benedict and The Supreme French toast with bananas and strawberries and whip cream and all of them are exceptional. There has been a wait each time we've gone which just goes to show you that it is worth the wait! Today they were obviously short-handed but everybody maintained their composure and delivered friendly service with a smile. Even the manager was on the floor helping and was Incredibly courteous and kept his cool during the rush. the portion sizes are generous and we've always left with leftovers! I am so happy that it is right down the street from my house!

Everything here looks delicious! I got the pitaya bowl. BEAUTIFUL presentation. I wish I had the option to blend protein into the pitaya though because it was just basically a smoothie in a bowl.

French toast was delicious but... Deep fried? I didn't expect that.  Coffee was good.  A little pricy for breakfast but overall good experience.  I'd love to go back and try the fresh baked items!

Oh my goodness....the pilgrim is the best savory thing I have ever eaten in a pastry crust. It was thanksgiving, perfectly executed and tucked into a flakey, not at all soggy, pillow of heaven...served with gravy and cranberry sauce. If youre doing it right, you slather both all over your pastry to get a bit in every bite. I want to try every pasty and cant wait to go back!
