After several bad dental experiences, I have finally found a dental office I can trust and enjoy!  I have been going to Dr. Lester's office now for a year and I am consistently impressed with their service! Stephanie is an amazing Dental Hygienist and treats her patients with care and respect. I finally have a dentist I can trust and know that they won't try to perform unnecessary procedures.

Finally getting around to writing a review for one of my favorite local new mexican grub spots.  I highly suggest starting with the chips and salsa and a house margarita, for an entree I HIGHLY suggest the Osso Bucco! Some of the most tender, roasted pork I have ever had! Servings are well sized, and typically come with rice and beans.   Overall pretty good service, however every once and a while you will get a slow waiter (typically when sitting outside).   The happy hour is descent; however I think the Margaritas should be $1 or 2 cheaper based on quality and size.   I love the outdoor seating and when the weather is nice you can't beat a margarita and mexican food next to the waterfall.  Keep up the good work!

My go to bar in south scottsdale! The people that work here make this place special. My first visit, almost a year ago, the manager Adam made us feel right at home and even provided some drinks on the house. Being a poor college student at the time, I thought this was the greatest thing since Ramen noodles.   Then we meet Flicka! The owner of this bar is the nicest most interesting person I have ever meet. Anyone that goes to Flickas on a regular basis knows Flicka. He is always a great host to us and he makes this place more than just another bar in Scottsdale.  With the projectors and multiply TVs this is a great place to catch a game and the food is amazing. The dollar tacos on Tuesdays and Thursdays are unbelievable, but my go to meal are the chicken fajitas!! Oh man they are delicious.

This whole in the wall joint has filled my belly and put a whole in my wallet because I can't resist their traditional gyro. The price is right for these large gyros and sandwiches. Don't go here if you expect the typical elegant Scottsdale dining experience. This place gets down to the point and makes good food, while not worrying so much about decor and presentation.

My beagle Sidekick has been to Tailwinds over 50 times and we have never had a problem!  I used to take my dog here daily for day care and I have never had a bad experience. He is always in a great mood when I go to pick him up and he is typically tired which makes me think he gets plenty of exercise. I am always hesitant of services I don't get to monitor, such as doggy day care, but Tailwinds has never gave me a reason to question their services.   We have also boarded Sidekick here for up to 4 days and we have never had any problems. He requires special instructions due to allergies and it seems everything was followed correctly.  The facility is very nice and it seems like there is plenty of room in the kennels and play area.   My only suggestion is to provide a little more feedback in terms of daily activities completed and dog behavior. When my dog was a puppy it would have been really helpful to hear how he did during the day. I think it would be refreshing to learn about his day, so I can be more confident that my dog is receiving the proper care.  Keep up the good work and I am sure we will be back soon.

Going off of the positive yelp reviews I chose Angel Eye Services to come in and clean a home I was moving out of. However, I was rather disappointed with the results.  The people cleaning were professional and kind however they must have been moving at half speed because 4 hours later it seemed like the house should have been much cleaner. My landlord provided me with a checklist of items to clean, which I provided to the crew. The carpets were cleaned prior, eliminating one of the larger tasks. One of the crew members spent close to 3 hours cleaning the kitchen which quite frankly wasn't very dirty to begin with. I understand that cleaning takes time but 3 hours later I still found several areas in the kitchen that were looked over. Also she didn't have oven cleaner and had to run down to the store to grab some. I would think a professional cleaning service would always come equipped with oven cleaner since I would imagine that is a pretty common item to clean.  Overall the experience was so-so and the results were below par. After 4 hours there will still items that had to be done; however I didn't want to continue to pay them so I finished myself.   Hiring professional cleaners I expected them to show up with professional tools, vacuums, and cleaners; however they had standard equipment that yielded less than professional results.

My go to bar in college and still one of my favorite spots.  Everyone knows of the infamous Thursdays nights and gameday madness that makes Devils Advocate the go to college bar but I have a new found love for this bar as my go to lunch spot! By far the BEST lunch happy hour I have come across! Buy one get one burgers, $1 tacos, BOGO pizzas, and $1 domestic pints. All the food is awesome especially the tacos, and a cold beer is a great addition to the work day. Adam, the manager, always makes us feel welcome and typically the bartending/waiting staff is quick and friendly.  If you don't like crowds avoid Thursday nights, especially during school.   Keep it up DA!

El pastor Burrito, a cold Tequila Fresca, live music, and top it off with a hot churro! My favorite music venue in AZ by far!  Been here on several occasions and every visit has passed my expectations. The food is delicious and affordable. The specialty drinks are unique and kickass; however slightly more expensive. There is ample seating both in the lounge and music venue area, and there really is no bad seat in the house.  The scene is very diverse but leans more towards the hipster side; however this all depends on who is playing.   The audio quality is above average in the music venue area, and the small setting makes for a very intimate show.  Highly suggest this place and I hope it is here for as long as I am!

By far my favorite coffee shop in all of Arizona! I think I have been to pretty much everyone in the valley.  This place has fueled my temptation to quit the 9-5 and do freelance out of a coffee shop all day! Nothing better than a dirty chai and an evening chilling on a chaise lounge chair! I almost lost all faith in Cartel after attending the Tempe location several times and getting bad vibes from the employees every visit. However I am glad I got over my "cartel" fear and checked out the old town location. This place is a 180 deg difference from the tempe location. I was greeted by a helpful, friendly staff that doesn't come off as coffee snobs, because their is nothing worse than a barista with an attitude. Keep up the friendly staff and great atmosphere and I will be a life long patron!  Plus they have a small but great selection of craft beers!  Prices are on par with all other coffee shops in the area. Wireless internet is free and consistently works well.

Great food, atmosphere, and beer selection however a couple details are missing.   Me and some friends went and checked out Brat Haus in the afternoon/evening on a Friday night and overall it was a great experience. I was impressed with the menu and love the concept of beer first, food second. I had the spicy brat with an assortment of toppings which came out to around $7, which I would say was worth it.  We also got a large fries as an appetizer and I was very impressed, especially with the dipping sauces.  Why not 5 stars? I have run in to this WAY too much from places like Brat Haus. They set a great German mood with their Brats and import craft beer selection, so you really start to get into a German pub mindset then......Nickleback comes blasting onto the speakers. You put all this effort into making me feel like I am in a German, craft beer, easy going environment, but then you play a pop station that plays Nickleback and Lady Gaga. Take a couple days, make a playlist that goes with your atmosphere, this is important! The crowd here isn't the typical Scottsdale crowd, so they shouldn't play the typical Old Town Scottsdale music.  Other than this, great place and I will definitely be returning to play that strange washers game!

Still not convinced.  Went to check out this newly opened grub spot expecting more. We took some people out of town talking this place up, since we are huge fans of The Grind. We stuck with don't judge a book by its cover and went ahead got a table despite the outside appearance. I can tell they put some time into improving this spot but the inside still has a dive bar feel which I was not expecting. The beer selection was good and overall we all enjoyed the drinks. We ordered the chips, salsa, and guac. and were not impressed, so we finished up our drinks and headed out to eat dinner else where. The girls in our group really enjoyed their Moscow Mule in the metal glasses, so definitely got that right.  I think if I came in with a different mind set, and was in a dive bar mood I would enjoy this spot. Once I do this I may come and up the star count.  (I enjoyed the Mad G House Brew; however I am not sure it is fair to call it a house brew if isn't brewed in house)
