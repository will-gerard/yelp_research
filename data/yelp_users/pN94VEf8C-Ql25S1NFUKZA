I never feel like I am NOT being ripped off or leaving the store with even remotely satisfied with the random few dollars they will you not be 100% on what they are taking. Make sure you see what they take and aren't sneaky: the feel like the clothes and turnover amount is overpriced and not 30% or anywhere close to what they buy it for. I have also been told to give to goodwill and not to let let that store rip u off  blatantly. That's the WORD around town.  F - FAIL review from word of mouth & personal experience

I have heard great things about Pearl Sushi and have wanted to check it out for quite some time. So I finally went there and was very very disappointed. When I first arrived was not greeted or directed where to go, I went and sat at a high top that was the only one open besides a table that was dirty from the previous guests. When I sat down they asked if it was just the 2 of us and told us it was reserved for bigger groups. So we asked to sit at the dirty high top and they Said that would be fine and would clean it off. We stood at the bar for 10 minutes before they got around to clean it off. The table was left wet. When we finally sat down our server didn't greet us and was extremely rude when taking our order. She was the worst waitress I have ever had and couldn't Believe she even have a job as a serving because she had the worst attitude and obviously wasn't happy to be there. The sushi was average and slow service. Finally we left and were bombarded by people coming in and had a hard a hard time getting out the door because of the way the restaurant was set up. All in all was this place had the worst service, worst set up, and was not worth the money.

I have gone to pretty much all the clubs and bars in Old Town Scottsdale and Firehouse is definitely my favorite place to go when I go out. The reason I like Firehouse is because its a very relaxed environment as well as a fun upbeat atmosphere. You can go casual or done up and there is a wide variety of people. There is a huge patio which is nice during the day and night. I really liked the theme of the entire bar and the creative artsy set up.  The first experience at Firehouse I had a reserved table for my friends birthday party and the tables have couches that were SO comfortable. Our cocktail waitress was fun, prompt and made sure we had our drinks filled to the top! A+ I don't know how much the bottle service was but the drinks I bought from the bar were significantly cheaper than other bars that I have gone to. Other times I was out day drinking and the bar staff was very friendly and seemed to enjoy their work. And believe it or not Firehouse has the best food ever... Especially the Spicy Chicken Pita. I highly recommend it. Everything I have tried I loved but Im addicted to the pita! Firehouse is also open after hours so its a great place to end the night, sober up, meet up with friends and get your late night food! All and all I have had great experiences at Firehouse every time I have gone and its def my favorite crowd and environment.

Spanish Fly is finally open!  The set up is beautiful and welcoming.  Love the day beds and cabanas with Tvs. I didnt try any of the Mexican food but did order a roll that was delicious and served promptly. One of the bathrooms didnt have mirrors which I dont like but were clean. The drinks are a little over priced and the crowd wasnt my style.  Loved the place, wouldnt go in the pool or go to at night but def a fun place to chill have a couple drinks poolside.

I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.
