Wow, decent Ballet in Phoenix...pinch me.  I have not been in the last year or so to one of the productions, but Ballet Arizona has been a treat under Ib Anderson's direction.  I'm a fan of the classical ballets and have loved their Swan Lake and Giselle productions.  This year's season is ending, so I must repent and make a few shows next year.

This review is for the current production ending 4/5/09, Masters of Movement.  Wow. What a great program.  They led w/ the classic Les Sylphides, but it was the 2 modern pieces that blew my socks off.  Polyphonia choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon had some incredible movements of balance and dexeterity that I turned to my sis, who was attending with me, and commented, "I bet you and the Irish Hubbie do that in the bedroom."   The final piece was The Golden Section from the Twyla Tharp ballet The Catherine Wheel. Twyla Tharp collaborates with David Byrne (Talking Heads) = FUUUUNNNN. The energy of that number with the dancers flying and the beat of Byrne's music made that piece my favorite.  David Byrne ROCKS.

Dearest Abbey, you lose a star because the price for the Ceremony of Loveliness is too high.  Granted you have included tip and tax in the individual price so I don't have to bother w/ the icky math, but $23 seems high for sandwiches, a few savories, scones and some desserts.  Didn't you also use to include fruit?  However, you still rock a great tea, the food is good and it is so girly fun to browse and linger...I will keep coming when I want to let my inner maiden out.

We tried Gelato 69 or whatever it is that opened on the NE corner of Dobson and Warner.  No way it can compare to Angel Sweet.  Angel Sweet puts them to shame.  The staff is more than willing to let you sample a variety of flavors.    My only gripe:  make the Valentine's special, Hugs and Kisses, part of the regular offerings.  I LOVE IT.

I tried Kisses this last Friday because a friend gave me a coupon.  $17.99 for a pedi.    They were busy...too busy for my taste.  What do I expect on a Friday afternoon?  Most salons are probably busy because of the weekend...chicks got to get their toes spiffy.  It's not a large place and is crowded with equipment and tables.  I did not like the fancy pedi chairs either, if you do the roller on it, it makes your body jut out almost a good foot when the rollers go by.  Because of the crowd, it felt like a rushed assembly line.  Not a relaxing environment at all.  My pedi...eh.  She talked me into a callus treatment, which I did need, but she was a little to boisterous on the right foot, I had an open sore a day later.  I also had some blood residue on the sides of both of my big toes.

Good food.  My daughter and I like the Relleno.  The chicken chimi is STUFFED w/ chicken.  Don't know if they still charge for additional chips and salsa after the compliementary serving.  They give you 3 different salsas:  green, red and a sour cream with chilis.  Yum.

Man, this place cost me a ton of money and did crappy work.  The brakes they use are metal, so the crud on my wheels was nasty and the life of the brakes was fleeting.  When they would fix one thing, lo and behold something else needed to be fixed.  Mainly my fuel pump, which caused my car to have major start issues once replaced.  The fuel pump was because my gas guage suddenly stopped working after they had replaced my struts.  They could never get my tires balanced.  I regret the money they took from me and think about 1/2 the work they did on my car was not necessary.

I don't get Cold Stone.  My daughter once got the mint flavor w/ mix-in, it tasted like toothpaste, the mint flavor was so strong!  The mix-ins give ice cream w/ so-so flavor some zip, but that adds too many unnecessary calories.  If I'm gonna blow bucks on ice cream, its either a special stop to Angel Sweet where the flavors of the gelato on its own make it yummy, no need for mix-ins, or I'll pick up some Ben & Jerry's, Blue Bunny or Breyers from Fry's.

Went to Flancers the first time this last week.  I got the Prickly Pear Caesar Chicken.  I was not a fan.  The dressing didn't taste much like Caesar and while the Prickly Pear flavoring was tasty, it seemed odd for a Caesar.  I got the salad when we could not get a wheat crust pizza larger than 10 inch for the hubbie and I to share.  He said the pizza was okay, but it didn't look appetizing to me.  The bread that came w/ my salad, loaded w/ parmesan cheese, was tasty, but for a carb watcher, too much.  Now that I think about it, I don't remember the taste of parmesan on the salad.  My biggest knock on the place:  the lager beer selection.  American lagers only.  I don't care for American lagers.  Bud Light makes me burp, a lot, and American lagers to me lack the flavor of a Stella, Phuket, Corona, Peroni, etc.  For a restaurant that offers beer pairings, they need to overhaul the lager selection for those of us not into ales.  I'd visit one more time if I could have a Stella w/ my meal, but with the lager selection, I can scratch them off my list.

My mom took my daughter here under the previous ownership.  I went twice and was kinda meh.  Then she took the daughter back recently and told me it was under new ownership.  Decided to check it out.  I've had the spa pedicure and a color change, both times very happy with the results.  Amazed my color change only has chipping on the big toes, and this is after hiking all over Sedona.  Granted my Keens have protected toes, but I was impressed.  Toes held up much better than my backside which has lovely bruises after a nice slide down the Harding trail.  This place is fantasically clean.  $22 for a spa pedi w/ hot rocks.  Not a bad deal at all.

We ordered 2 couches from Lazy Boy and I am very unhappy with the quality of the upholstery.  Esp on the arms.  I have never seen arms with puckers in them before in my 50+ years.  I even had Lazy Boy out to look at them and the tech said that is the way they work and that I should push the fabric to take out the lumps.  I can tell with my untrained eye, too much fabric was installed.  The couch that faces out, also has spots underneath where the webbing is lose and can be visible.  I will never order anything from Lazy Boy again.

I'll chime in.  We had AZ Exterminating do a full-out caulk of our house because we have scorpions.  My husband wonders if we were seeing more scorpions after that because they were trapped in the house when we caulked.  Needless to say we switched to Assured Pest Control when we found a record 4 scorpions alive and kicking in one night in our front foyer and living room.  Since switching to Assured [(623) 877-0726], we still see scorpions outside...dead or dying.  Haven't had any in the house in some time.

I saw the Dunkin thread and felt I had to do a review for my favorite donut place.  I was introduced to Bosa by my church.  They have a Cafe between services and when they made the switch to Bosa, I noticed a big difference in quality and taste from the previous supplier.  The texture and creaminess of a simple glazed is similar to a Krispy Kreme.  The fritters are excellent and I like their bagels.  If I am going to pick up donuts to bring into work, I make a stop at Bosa.  To me, Dunkin is not as good as Bosa.    Bosa is unique to Chandler and we are lucky to have them.

Outside of the patio, not much to attract me to this place.  It is way too pricey for food that isn't any different or any better than any other Mexican place.

This store is NASTY.  The hubbie will shop here, but after my last visit about 4 months ago, I am proud to say I have not gone anywhere near it and am committed to never set foot in it again.  The parking lot is horribly lit, very dirty.  Gee, nice you have a security car, but why not put up more lights??  Once you walk into the store, the place has an odd smell, kinda chemical, like everything has been dunked into some odd preservative or de-louser.  The shopping carts are covered in a greasy grime; I would hunt for one that I could stomach putting my purchases inside.  Wal-mart's lack of cleanliness makes it easy for me to pay a little more to shop at Target.

This is the only sitdown Rosati's in the Valley.  The rest are takeout facilities.  We have only tried the pizza.  It is for strictly Chicago-style pizza lovers.  Love the deep dish.  If we do take out, we get the thin crust.  Tried Oregano's in Tucson and I liked the fact their thin crust was wavailable in wheat, and I liked it a little better than Rosati's.  Deep dish was similar, both are very good.  I feel like I'm cheating on Rosati's because it has been such a long time favorite, but I liked Oregano's pizza a little more.  And could someone explain to me the popularity of Nello's?  Yuck.

Prices...schmices.  This is still the place for me to go for pizza.  I'm raising them back up a star.  Ate here in Oct when the brother in-law was in town and their deep dish is still the bomb.  Loved the brother in-laws leftover thin crust too.

I feel like a wet blanket giving this place 2 stars, I know its popular, but its definitely not for our family.  The hubbie and I tried Guedo's YEARS ago (try over 10).  He didn't care for it...no chips n salsa to go w/ the meal?  No sides?  With him out of town, I figured it was a chance for me and the kids to try Guedo's since I didn't have any real issue with it when visiting it w/ the hubbie.  It was annoying that they do not take debit or credit cards...only cash.  Which I found out after they had rung up our ticket.  Fortunately they had an ATM machine in the place, so I was able to get cash along with a $2 fee.  The kids did not care for Guedo's.  Similar reasons to their dad...no chips and salsa, even if you pay extra for it at places like Rubio's?  My daughter didn't think her chicken Guedo burro was that good and my son wanted to get a refill on his drink, which he figured was not allowed, so he didn't ask.  For similar pricing, the son looks more favorably on Filiberto's where the burros are huge.  I did like my shrimp burro.  The indoor seating is cramped.  Tables are small; there really was only 1 table that could sit 4 in the space that was open.  I think there is additional indoor dining that may have been closed off, not sure, but it was too windy for me to eat outside.  No way I would eat outside too when the triple digits start hit.  So if you want a simple burrito, taco or torta w/ no sides and just a beer, I would re-visit Guedo's; however, to do so I would have to go alone or w/ someone that is not a family member.

Honest and reliable auto service.  Not sure how their prices stack up, because honest and reliable is more important to me.  I started taking my Olds to Dana after the recommendation of co-workers who have been taking their cars to them for several years.  They will assess things for me and let me know what I can and cannot wait on.

I'm seriously dropping Dana Tire big time!  When I last had my car in, they told me my brakes were at 30%...I interpreted that to "fix brakes with next service."  They replaced 4 tires for me and we discussed changing my shocks and struts, possibly with next service.  Not an urgent thing for me to do.  More of a nice to have.  Weeelll, I held off on next service, so finally had to get it done and went to Brake Masters because I figured I would let them do my brakes.  Brake Masters told me...your brakes are fine...it's your struts.  And I don't have shocks.  Additionally, my tires were significantly out of balance.  Something I was suspicious of after Dana replaced the tires, but wasn't quite sure because I figured shocks and struts needed to be done...but I don't have shocks!  Anyway, Dana clearly did not balance after replacing my tires and I don't know whose car they were refering to when they said the brakes were at 30% and that my struts had shocks and could wait (my right front strut had a nice leak in it).  Brake Masters got a ton of money out of me...I also had to replace a fuel pump...but they appear to actually check my car and know which one they are talking about.

Bleck!  Chips that taste funky, like the oil is rancid.  Salsa, Macayo's used to have awesome salsa, but now it seems water-downed.  This place looks like it needs a power-washer and a deep clean.  And the food was meh and really not very good.

Joe, I like your prices.    My daughter LOVES your packaged salads. I like your turkey sandwich meat. We both like your horrible looking but tasty green plant food juice, yum. I love your jojoba oil, esp. the price. My son loves the banana granola bars.  Sprouts has me for their vitamins and coffee.  But maybe, just maybe next time visiting Joe's I will price the coffee and if you have organic decafe at a reasonable price, Sprouts will have another reason to be 2nd best behind Joe's

This review is for the stadium as an NFL venue - Cards home game.  Nice stadium.  Traffic flow in and out is pretty well managed.  Caution to the women, do not bring a big purse.  You will be walking it back to your car.  They have addressed the hideous women's bathroom, long-line  situation that made ASU stadium so annoying.  Decent concession offerings...but very expensive.  Have only tried pop and water...its that expensive. (churros are 4 bucks???)  Excellent lawn for tailgating on the west side.  That area is totally cool, usually has a band, lots of people who have mastered the art of tailgating (flat screen tvs w/ satellite dishes!).  If you have season tickets, it sure is nice parking before the game in the W or Orange lots where the lawn is.  Not so nice getting out.  We preferred getting out of the Brown over by the high school.  The stadium has a well run bus service that gets you to and from the Brown.  Definitely a lot easier getting out of that lot.  Dig:  put a stinkin' plaque up by the outside memorial for Pat Tillman.  In a few years most people are going to be wondering who is this statute of a guy w/ weird hair, wearing a 40 on his shirt?  Best of all:  the place rocks when the crowd is into it and the opposing team has the ball.  WE DO THIS TOGETHER!  LET'S GO CARDINALS!!!

The salad the hubbie and I split (antipasto) was different from others in that it was mostly lettuce, but we liked that.  It was swimming in dressing, so I would order it again w/ the dressing on the side.  The pizza...tried the thin crust and I did not care for it because the dough was too tough for my taste.  The hubbie who is from Chicago said that it was true to a Chicago style where the dough is more chewy.  I couldn't even cut it w/ a dinner knife.  My favorite Chicago style pizza is deep dish.  Since there is no Gino's East, I will continue to get my deep dish craving taken care of by Rosati's dine-in location on McQueen and Ray.  When I want thin crust, it's gonna be either Rosati's or Oregano's wheat crust.

The best place still to watch football is at home in front of our big screen, but this place is a nice diversion.  I love the golden wings, the greek salad, the french fries...I like Zipps.  Wings are good enough to discourage the husband and son from going to Native New Yorker, where the only real good thing on the New Yorker menu is the wings and very little else.

I just got back from dinner w/ my mom and sister.  We took our time, sampling several items from the menu.  We loved this place.  5 stars on Yelp was our consensus.  Mom felt it was one of the better restaurant experiences she has had in some time.  We started w/ an appetizer platter of spring and fresh rolls, and shrimp bruscetta.  After that we split a bowl of the Chicken, ginger and rice porridge.  YUM.  Next time I'm sick, I'm stopping in to get some for takeout.  We ordered #23 (beef, shrimp vermicelli), #28 (lemongrass chicken)  and #39 (vegetable yellow curry) for our meals and could not pick a favorite.  They were all very good.  For dessert, the owner recommended the banana pudding w/ tapioca. and coconut milk.  I will be getting this too the next time I'm sick to go w/ my chicken/ginger soup.  We will definitely be back to try other items.  I got the pho ga to go for my daughter and she gave it a thumbs up.  The owner noted we did not really eat the rice that came with our dishes and told us next time we are in to ask for veggies on the side instead.  The average dinner menu price seems to be $8-$9.

I took the daughter and this time I tried the Pho Ga...it is yummy.  They give you a tray of condiments that you can add, I chose to add the spice paste/sauce to give it a little kick.    I have also made it back to get my take out of ginger and chicken when I was feeling a little under the weather...bought 2 orders and the hubbie got to try it and enjoyed it.

I agree w/ Heather, the Evil Jungle Princess is a great dish.  My daughter gets it w/ the noodles, I get it with the rice.  Facility seems cleaner than the norm for most of the Asian restaurants in my area.  For dessert I like the fried bananas or Angel Sweet gelato (which is on the opposite corner).

I got engaged after eating at Macayo's many, many, many moons ago (hubbie figured a fancy night out would tip his hand).  I used to dine at this location nearly every Friday in the mid 90s when I started at Intel.  Since then, I have been underwhelmed each time I have visited.  Last visit:  toilet had overflowed in the women's bathroom, living one stall availalble for an 'ick' experience.  Couple that with the out-dated, disheleved looking front lobby and I washed my hands of an old stand-by.  Adios Macayo's.

Tough menu.  A lot of choices, so I was vacillating a lot.  I finally decided on the Ahi Tuna sandwich with sweet potato fries.  I also ordered the beet salad just to try it.  I liked everything.  Including the onion rings the hubbie ordered.  This would be the place I would go for onion rings.  Very tasty.  We sat outside. Not sure if it would be enjoyable in summer, but mid-Feb, with it finally hitting the upper 70s, it was wonderful.  Several people were there w/ dogs because it is really a picnic area.  We will go back.  I want to try the ahi salad...maybe stick w/ the ahi sandwich.  I think it will be the way to go when I'm craving a burger.  W/o a doubt, if you go, you HAVE to check out the bathrooms.

Ok, family-style review.  We ate there recently with our teenagers on the patio outside.  I like the atmosphere.  To me it's a little touch of a bar atmosphere, but not too much, a chance to give the kids a feel for more adult atmosphere w/o feeling like we are too permissive by exposing them to drunks.  I had the relleno.  Whatever it was coated in was too cruncy and fried.  I love rellenos and I did not care for the Gringos version.  Rest of the family liked their food and we will probably return.  Is it the best Mexican food, no, and it probably wouldn't be the first place we would think of when we are hungry for Mexican.

If you were going to build a shopping center next to a dry river bed, over former garbage dumps, Tempe Marketplace would be the result.  The Hastings and Hastings of architecture firms must be responsible for this one:  "We specialize in parking lots surrounded by stores.  Our idea of curb appeal is big, honking steel signs to attract the eye of  people in cars moving 70 miles per hour.  We also work with your community to ensure the drive to our facility is not a straight shot.  If our shopping center doesn't look significantly dated in 10 years, we haven't done our job."  My family is tired of me mentioning how much I dislike Tempe Marketplace everytime we pass it on the 202.

My mother and I tried this place out in December and really loved it.  It's hip, the Poached Pear Salad was very good, tea good.  Definitely will head back.  Worth a trip to downtown Chandler. ********************************************************************* We returned on a Friday evening (4/25/08).  We stuck with our salads that we both like (Poached Pear for me).  The dinner special that night was a tuna steak and another cut of steak for $23.  Another table was having that.  It looked good and I was tempted to try it.   For my beverage, this time I opted for an ice tea that was a special concoction for the night, a mixture of white teas that I cannot remember, that I really liked.  The owner, sadly I did not get his name, was asking diner's if they wanted to sample some wine from the Jerome winery that he is considering for the Loft's house wine.  We enjoyed the Chardonnay and Merlot, and enjoyed talking to the owner.   They also had a little 2 piece band playing.  One was a guitar, can't remember the other instrument....  I still really dig this place, but the service is spotty.

This place is close to where I used to work, so it was on the list of places to go for lunch or staff happy hour.  For some reason, it always seriously underwhelmed me.  Very dark, like it might be hiding dirt, the food passable and the service spotty.

Hadn't been into the Greek in quite some time.  Went in tonight and got the Greek Salad.  Fred, the owner, stacked my salad with chicken kabob, grilled chicken and gyro meat.  It was a high protein, low carb treat.  All 3 of the meats were flavorful and nicely cooked.  He also treated us to some complimentary hummus, enough that I brought leftovers home for my daughter, who loves hummus.  The hummus was yummy.  Fred makes the place.  It was also nice to see the place humming w/ some business on a Friday night.

The food was okay, but both the hubby and I prefer the Greek's Grill.  Spices chicken shawarma is much more salty and didn't seem to have as much flavor.  Plus the owners are like night and day.  Fred at Greek's Grill is a large part of the reason why we go there.

I guess I am one of the few that doesn't care for this place. It's busy, small, and a loud kid is very noticeable.  The hubbiend I had made our quarterly get together w an old friend at Sekai a few weeks previously, so we went non sushi. Got king crab soup. The base of the soup reminded me of the evil jungle princess at Thai Rama, so yum.  But for $6 I would have liked more crab. The chicken and shrimp fried rice, not so good. (I was wanting a comfort dish).  Hubbie's chicken teriyaki kind bland w a nice helping of vegetables. The rest of our group got sushi. Portions looked large, but it just did not look appetizing to me. This was our second visit to Sushiya and I don't believe I will go back. Sekai is first choice and I wouldn't mind another visit to Masa.

I'm gonna review this as a Cards season holder, eating at Yardhouse about 2 hours before kick-off.  It was odd that they put wrist bands on you when you walk in the door.  Not sure why.  We had to wait about an hour for our table.  Only gripe about the wait...I'm a football fan and a Fantasy owner...we stood outside, so I had to keep going in to check out the games on tv.  If you are interested in watching the games the entire time you are in a restaurant, the New Yorker is the place.  They typically aren't as busy in the restaurant side a couple hours before the game and they have tons of tvs.  Food at the New Yorker is not as good as The Yardhouse.  Hubbie and I split the french onion soup and it was tasty.  Lots of cheese and I liked dipping the sourdough bread on the side.  I got the cajun chicken ceasar salad and it had a nice kick to it.  The Yardhouse dressing is egg-less and still pretty tasty.  It was an ok ceasar.  Hubbie got the club sandwich and liked it.  The fries are more shoestring, and have that burger king coating on them, making them more tasty...but I would prefer no coating.  Son liked his sliders.  His girlfriend got the brownie dessert since she had eaten already.  It was huge and sweet.  We got into the stadium in time to watch the opening kick-off as we climbed to our seats.  Best of the entire day...Cards clinched the NFC West Division title.  Yay!

Based on the reviews, I figured I would like this place.  Maybe it would be a cross between Saigon Pho and Anise, wouldn't that be nice.  My fave is Anise for the quality, but its on the pricy side.  Saigon Pho is okay, always busy, but the quality can be hit or miss and they tend to use dark meat chicken instead of white, which I prefer.  Anyway, this is about Pho Chandler.  I won't return since it's out of our way (we were going to a play at Hamilton High).  Hubbie got a beef soup that had the gelatinous beef in it (w/ brisket too) that you either tolerate or will make someone like me gag.  He much prefered the beef soup he can get at Saigon Pho.  Daughter got the Pho Ga and she liked it and thought it was comparable to Anise but I was thinking no way just looking at the dish.  I got the lemongrass chicken and it was waaaaaayyy too sweet...and I have a tremendous sweeth tooth.  I much prefer the lemongrass at Saigon Pho.  The place is clean, service excellent.  Anise still remains my gold standard and Saigon Pho my fallback for when I want to go cheap.

The bagels aren't bad, but boy are their salad offerings yucky.  The caesar appears to be that processed chicken w/ its perfect grill marks, spongy look and funny taste, like it has been injected for flavoring.  The club has a sandwich sliced turkey that to me has that I'm-starting-to-turn-bad taste.

Definitely a pricer place to get dinner, but the food is excellent.  I noted too based on the menu that they have on their website they have dropped their prices and have added some cheaper items to the menu (pulled pork sandwich, fish and chips).  We got the calamari appetizer.  The plum/cilantro dipping sauce was great...a little sweet, but not too sweet, the calamari fried nicely...not overdone and chewy.  I got the tenderloin, which was $28 and is one of the items that has seen a price drop.  It was grilled to my specifications - medium rare.  I liked the sauce that came on it, the asparagus and potatoes that were sides.  My sister's chicken breast was tasty and my brother in-law liked his pork chop.  Hubbie thought the fish and chips was fine, but on the pricey side.  Bro in-law and sis split the creme brulee for dessert and loved it.

I LOVE Teavana and found their pricing comparable to loose leaf teas I was buying either thru mail or store.  Like Lindsay, I do not see Teavana as a drink shop for sipping and hanging a la Starbucks.  It is a retail shop.  I have loved Let's Do Tea's White Peach @ $14.95 for 1.5 oz + tax and shipping.  The Octavia White Ginger Peach I picked up at Urban Tea Loft for $14.95 is also a 1.5 oz size.  So Teavana's White Peach already has them beat in my book because for the same price I am getting .5 oz more and unlike Let's Do Tea, no shipping.  That pricing is also competitive with Republic of Tea's loose peach/ginger.  The teas are delicious because they are premium blends and all loose leaf.  Since it's summer, I went with the black peach tea to save on my costs icing the tea.  My daughter guzzles it like I do, and adding a packet of stevia, a good white tea iced was getting expensive.  I was able to do the black peach/ginger @ $3.50 for 2 ozs.  Worth it in my book to get a better grade of tea than anything I can buy off the grocery shelf.  So I did not buy the Teavana White Peach, but when the clerk pulled back the lid and showed me their White Peach, I could see it was a gorgeous tea with chunks of goodies in it.  When winter starts coming around, I will be investing in their White Earl Grey and the Chai blend they have been sampling.  That chai will be expensive...but dammit I'm worth it!

Okay, I am now climbing on the over-priced bandwagon and I think Teavana's white teas lack body, texture, creaminess??  As I have shifted to white tea, Teavana's pricing is much too high compared to Harney & Son's teas.  I was shocked that I paid 1/3rd of Teavana's 2 oz pricing to buy a hot tea in order to sample their Lavendar blend.  $5 bucks for a cup of tea?!??  Are you kidding me?  I could swallow 1/5th of the 2 oz price.  So I am done w/ Teavana.  I really like the Harney's mutan white peach and mutan white and am waiting for their Jasmine Pearls and White Earl Grey. I am getting away w/ using my Harney white tea satchets for 3 cup brews.  Not bad.  That drives their price even further down.  Harney's website:  http://www.harney.com/index.cfm  heh

Wow, reading the other review, guess waiting for your food to be served can be an issue at this restaurant.  Try waiting an hour and 1/2.  Other diners were so perturbed they left in frustration; the intrepid restaurant staff then offered the departed diners plates to those still waiting for food - TACKY.    By the time our food was served, my mother in-laws hot beef was COLD.  They supposedly were short 2 cooks. Since they had a large group of women and a Red Hat society that seemed to get their food in good timing, maybe the cooks walked out mid-shift.  My husband wouldn't let me make a stink, but after a wait that long, with a hot dish being served cold, there should have been an offer at comping a meal or taking a certain percentage off.  How on earth does this place survive?  Salsa was good, shredded beef chimi I had was below average and over-fried.  At least I know now if ever antiquing in Glendale again I can avoid this restaurant!  So far the downtown Glendale restaurants I have tried have been sub-par and not worth trying again (Kimberly Ann's Tea Shop was the other).

Oh so very sad we did not discover this place 3 years ago and thousands of dollars earlier.    My Olds Intrique is the descriptive picture in the dictionary next to the term 'money pit'.  After Brake Masters putting expensive crap work into my car, Greulich's has been doing decent but expensive work.  With the amount of money I have spent on my car, I could have bought a 3rd car or put 2 1/2 kids through orthodonture.    With Chuck at Family Auto Care I have found a mechanic I can trust who is willing to knock his labor down in order to keep my business.  He has it.  Thanks Chuck for operating an honest, hard-working business that is willing to give the customer a break.

Raul did a tremendous job on our garage cabinets.  They look awesome.  He hit a snag with a built-in dresser for a bedroom closet...the wall was bowed.  He worked out a solution, an entire dresser unit that would not be part of the wall.  The dresser is awesome.  Looks like a built-in.  We looked at 2 companies and were impressed by what VIP could offer and the variety of solutions as well.  VIP will get our repeat business.

Last Cards regular season game, kids in attendance w/ the parents, and we decided it would be a good time to try the SR Chop House.  We left a little earlier than usual from our Chandler home.  Got to the Chop House by 10:30ish.  On game days, they have an abbreviated menu with breakfast items, sandwiches, salads, burgers, and 2 steaks.  The non-breakfast items they do not start serving until 11, so we enjoyed our beverages.  I got the Ranch Club, hold the mayo and it was GOOD.  Sourdough bread was lightly toasted, the ham, bacon very tasty.  I upgraded to the sweet potato fries...holy cow are they generous with the fries.  The son and husband got huge burgers and enjoyed them.  The daughter got the club wrap and enjoyed it as well.  We were in a smaller room and able to see several games on the TVs.  I will definitely re-visit this place over the Yardhouse.    Our server was friendly.  There was a slight wait for our order, but not too bad.  Either way it scored us a free dessert surprise from mgmt.  I LOVE proactive mgmt.  Maybe the owners/mgrs of SR Chop House can buy out the horrible ownership/mgmt of Bitzee Mama's.  See my review of that restaurant for my dining in hell story of 2008.  Bitzee's doesn't hesitate to make you wait...and for crappy food no less.  After a full season, my choices for dining pre-game:  Chop House Native New Yorker (if hankering for wings, yum) Yardhouse Cracker Barrel Johnny Rockets McDonalds Waffle House Quik Trip Bitzee Mama's if someone puts a gun to my child's head or gives me $10K

Went here prior to the Cards v Broncos game w/ my daughter.  She has not eaten at Bitzee Mama's, so this is her least favorite Mexican restaurant in Glendale.  Bitzee's is still mine.  First, I've been programmed to the free chips n salsa basket at most Mexican restaurants.  Odd that there was none here and it was not listed as a menu item either.  Options appear to be nachos or a layered dip.   We ordered the shrimp ceviche which is marinated in lemon, garlic, the chef's spices...it was very bland.  I think the Chef left out the spices.  It wasn't the only thing he left out.  He left stuff out of my burro.  We didn't finish the ceviche.  The daughter got the tortilla soup and did not like it at all. She wanted to give them her grandmother's phone number to call for a good recipe.  I tried it and it was okay.  Tested kinda like watered down queso.  We didn't finish the soup.  My burro was missing its key ingredients of sour cream, guacamole and oaxaca cheese and the drizzled sour cream on top.  That should have been the first clue to the waitress that something was up w/ the dish.  Plus it wasn't chimi-style like I ordered.  Rather than send it back to have it fried, I decided only to say something when the bill came if I was charged for chimi-style...I was not.  W/o the cheese, I had more of diet burro, so I guess it was okay cause I saved calories for later.   I saved more calories eating only 1/2 the burro.    Haven't tried the Irish pub yet that went in where the Fox Sports Grill is.  Places to go prior to games remain in preference order:  The Yardhouse, Saddle Ranch, Native New Yorker.  The place was not busy...it picked up the closer it got to noon.  This is 3 hours before kick-off.  I don't think diners are lining up to get inside here like they do The Yardhouse.  ******************** UPDATE:  5/14/2011 Sometimes I like to look back on my Methinks not reviews to see what other diners are saying after my visit.  I'm amazed Jack's is still opened.  To be in the Westgate, which sees probably meh traffic when there is no event, and then not be busy when an event takes place, how do you stay open??   Based on my experience at Bitzee's Mama and other diner reviews on that restaurant, I can only surmise that the offerings for Mexican in Glendale are so slim that its citizens are very forgiving.

This is separate (not the same owners) as the Ray & McQueen location and the Warner and McClintock...has to be because the  method of making the deep dish pie was totally different and even the crust was different.  Cheese on top, so it was OVERDONE.  No where near as good as the pie at the original dine-in location at Ray & McQueen.  If you are craving deep dish from Rosati's, go to Ray & McQueen.

The cookies rock.  That's all I got to say.  When browsing Glendale, stop in and buy one.     Avoid Bitzee Mama's mexican restaurant a few doors north of there.

Average sushi, not the best or most abundant pieces of fish on the rolls.  Ambience a nice change up.  Service, meh. Took too long to get waters and drink order, but after that, service was okay.  Just felt like we sat a little too long from the initial seating til we got some attention from wait staff.  I did like the hamachi popper, calamari and goyza (potstickers).  Unagi sauce a little too sweet.  Don't think I will go back unless we are dining with folks who want to go there.  I prefer Sekai in Mesa or Masa in Gilbert.

This place is not closed.  They are still in business.  We had them install 28 windows in our house 3 years ago and the quality of the installation has not held up.  While they have come out at various time to address issues, there has been nagging ones that I cannot get resolved:  1) They never did follow through and do a post-installation inspection  2) Never removed the screws the installers put in the base of my windows and caulked the holes; this is a no-no because the screw is a channel for water run off into my wall  3) I have had my bedroom windows re-caulked twice because of major cracking/separation from the wall and am now doing it a 3rd time; in fact I have several windows with major separation/cracking and my handy man will be doing the recaulking...inside and outside  4) Never came back and rehung 2 family room windows that were not installed correctly (flush to the wall) and that have leaked twice, majorly, during heavy rainfall.  Both times the windows have had to be recaulked on the outside.  This summer I had an additional window pour water into my house, my single pane windows that were on my house for 15 years never leaked in the amount these 3 windows have  The owner, Jeff Caruso, was rude to me regarding rehanging my family room windows; he was the one who suggested that it needed to be done...he apparently did not want to do the actual work.  So steer clear of this company.  The product may be nice, but good windows are useless if the installation is poorly done.

We got bids from several landscape companies, 2 won the responsive sweepstakes: Landscape 20/20 and Outside Living Concepts, with Landscape 20/20 being the winner. Sean made numerous trips to meet with us, traded numerous emails, was very responsive to texts. Revised his plans several times.  Big plus in our book.  Once we got our act together and let Sean know we were ready to start, the job was completed very quickly.  So different from our experience with Poco Verde who did our front yard.  It seemed like that job drraaaagggggged and it took 2+ weeks.  The backyard was done within a week.  We are thrilled w/ our backyard.  Love the plants Sean suggested and are happy with the work his team did.  I finally have my dream backyard patio.

I like this theater...because of its proximity to home, stadium seating, convenience of the mall for eating, shopping.
