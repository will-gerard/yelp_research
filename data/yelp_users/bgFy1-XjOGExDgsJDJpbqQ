So far I have not had any problems here. All the doctors I've talked to are very nice. I'm going for migraines and currently receiving Botox. After my first set of shots I did have extreme neck pain for weeks. But found out they probably gave me too much in my neck. So after almost a year they talked me into doing it again. The second time much better. I'm here again today to get another set. They say it takes a few series of shots to really start working. Here's to getting better. Will update later on results.

Very good one of my favorite Mexican places, you can't go wrong here. Prices reasonable. Even if it's not on the menu they do their best to get it for you. Never had a problem here.

Really like this place. Good food, decent prices. At lunch time I always ask to be seated in Nina's section. She has to be one of the nicest waitresses ever!

Love Teds hotdogs! Love that you get to watch them make everything there on the grill in front of you. I usually always get the all beef hotdog and they let you pick what toppings you want at the end. The onion rings are great!

Always come for breakfast. Really good. Weekends are always packed. We've come for other meals and I didn't really care that much for them so we just stick to the breakfast.

First time... Well see how it is. this was a very nice restaurant. the owner himself comes out and talks to you. wasnt very busy the night we went. they try hard to get you what you want even if it isnt on the menu. i cant remember exaclty what i ordered but it was very good. my husband got a pizza it was very good as well. maybe we'll go back if we are ever in the area again.

I am only giving this place a 2 star because our waitress did her best. It started off ok with putting in our names. we were told we would have a 10-20 min wait, I'm ok with that.it turned out to be 30 min with people who came after us being seated before us. we were a party of 2, pretty easy to seat. I got a migraine while waiting outside so long so when we were seated at a table in a noisy area I asked for a booth because they were a little enclosed, I was told we would have to wait another 10 at least. I told them I need to order a drink to take my medicine and couldn't wait any longer. we were told once we received something we couldn't change seats. so when our waitress came and I expressed my opinion she went to find the manager whom I told what happened. they gave me my drink then let us move tables. the food was just ok, the prices a bit high, I liked the burger bar at NEW YORK NEW YORK much better. we went there twice and perfect both times!

My husband and i went there last night using our homerun certificate. i bought 2 homeruns, the one we used last night was worth it because it only cost a dollar that included cover and 1 draft beer. the other coupon i bought i should not of because we will probably be getting there when cover charge is free,which i did not know before i bought the coupon. anyway it was a fun place, very loud where we were sitting and i dont know if the air was broken or not but we were sweating like crazy and we were just sitting and not moving around. we will be going back as i still have one more homerun to use, going with friends this time. hopefully we will sit down front and it will be cooler.

Went there for lunch buffet, what a disappointment. For 5.99 you get pizza breadsticks and pasta. They will give you one small bowl of salad for an additional 99 cents ( what a deal ) I guess if you've lived in Phoenix your whole life then this is what you expect from their buffet. The pizza hut buffets we are used to for 5.99 include pizza, breadsticks, salad bar which includes salad, cold pastas, fruits,deserts and pretty much what you'd find on most salad bars plus 2 hot soups. All this for the EXACT same price! Wow.. Guess if we ever get a craving for pizza hut buffet we will wait until we go back to IL. to visit because it's a scam here.

They usually do pretty well here. This time our wings were a little on the cold side, they replaced them immediately with some hot ones. I wish they would go back to half price appetizers instead of just 4.00

Just came from another visit at our native grill. We asked to be seated in Robin's section since we found out she was working tonight. Her impeccable service never ceases to amaze me. There were 7 of us altogether including 2 small children and she took care of us without skipping a beat. Everything was perfect and drink refills on spot. If you ever go there look Robin up.

I'm only giving 2 stars  because the only reason I come here is for the green chicken chile soup and they got rid of it. Plus our server was kinda slow, took other orders while just staring at us. Even tho he was nice.. U need to be a good server too

visited on  5/4/2012 . The 2 stars are because we did call ahead seating and when we arrived they didn't have our confirmation number but the girl remembered my name. Was told it would be about 15 minutes but was seated in about 5. Was given a table for 4 with a party of 5. Don't know about everyone  else but the table gets very crowded with 5 people sitting at a table for 4 with a  5th person at the end. Can't move at all no room for your food. Asked about a differant table and was told we'd have to wait 25 minutes .., really? We told you half hour in advance we had a party of 5. Was not happy this time around.

2 ice teas in a row so far and brought with lemon when I asked for none. Starting today waitresses get no tip if their listening skills are lacking....

Only been here one time. Went for my in-laws anniversary. I had the small filet and I have to say it was the most tender filet I've ever had in my whole life. Yes this place is very expensive, but it was delicious. Everyone in our group loved their meal. I can't remember what else I had as I'm making this post months after our visit. One con that I can remember is that the tables I thought were too close together. Made it hard if you needed to get up and go to the bathroom.

I've been going to Deyna for 5 years now. She's a great person, not once has she ever made me feel uncomfortable. Her prices are reasonable. Most of the time I call her last minute and she always does her best to fit me in.

Pizza was good garlic knots good. Waitress seemed a little preoccupied had to finally call her over to place order. When we left the tables right outside door had smokers at them, a real turnoff for me. Thought the law stated they had to be 20 away from door.

Just ate there tonight and it was pretty good. Husband and I both just had burgers, they were cooked how we asked. Mine had lots of bacon. Onion rings were good. Kids had hot dog and chicken tenders. Hot dog looked uh.. But he ate it. Chicken tenders were big, got 2, looked good. Were served lots of fries with their dinners. Service was good too. All in all was a good place.

We also tried it and did not like it. We were seated right away and given our drinks. I asked about happy hour specials and was told they only had drink specials, only to find out about a half hour later they had free appetizers around the corner. After our drinks  came we waited about 20 minutes for our order to be taken, the waitress never came back. Finally a manager (I think)saw the look on my face and asked to take our order. Food took awhile to come out, food was fair. Saw some customers getting taken care of regularly but we sure were not. It was an awful experience.

NO STARS FOR THIS PLACE!!! We wanted to eat here only because they had charging stations for our car. But guess what 2 suv's were parked in the spots and the sign clearly states NO PARKING UNLESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE  thought maybe the manager would help us out but he basically said F U... Not getting my business guess I have to at least give one star but can't make a review with no stars

Ate there last night for the first time. it was pasta night. for 9.95 you get the salad bar and a chef prepared pasta dish. it was very good. taking friends and parents there next week. chef was super nice and very helpful in helping you decide what you wanted. he wasnt pushy and didnt try to hurry you. i even got a free creme brulee (my favorite dessert) from him. he created a strawberry one. very yummy. they have a chicken bufett on tue. (have not tried it yet but want to) and prime rib on friday and saturday. dont know what took us so long to finally go to this place but im sure we will be regulars now. much better than the duke i think.

Went there last night with 2 toddlers. They were so patient with them because they didn't know what they wanted on their pizza. Love this place, have been there many times and it's always great and great service!

This is our new McDonald's to go to now since its closest to our house. I like that it's not crowded with kids running around because there's no playground. Which i never let my grandkids play in anyway because the kids in there are way too rough and most of the parents never seem to be paying attention to their children. We've never had a problem any time we've went, whether it's been inside or in the drive thru. Everyone has always been nice and accommodating.
