I've been taking my 2 english bulldogs to Alma School Animal Hospital for about 4 years.  In fact, my boy was born here, delivered via C-section.  They have been great with the care of my dogs.  And they are experts when it comes to the bully breed.  If you have a bulldog, make sure to take them to Alma School Animal Hospital.  They have the friendliest staff and I feel very confident with their care.  Thank you Dr, Junger and Dr. Christian for always taking great care of my pups.

I'm a huge fan of their coconut soup with shrimp.  And I love their Thai Iced Teas....best Thai food in AZ!

I've been to other Danny's Family Car Wash locations where the service has been fine.  Not here!  I got the "works", and I don't think they even vacuumed my car.  I have doggy fur and debris all over.  I'm very dissapointed and will never return to this location! They need to hire more people....it is understaffed and they can't keep up with the lunch crowd.  Everyone there complained about the wait and the quality of service, not just me.

Came here for passport picture.  Horrible!!!  I had them take my picture a few times...and when printed the photo was blurry each time.  I finally gave up....they seemed bothered that I had them retake my picture.  But, hey, who wants to be stuck with a bad passport photo????

Awesome food!!! Great prices!  Good quality!  If you're looking for a place that is healthy and delicious, this is it! They also offer gluten free options.  Even if you're not a vegetarian, you should give them a try! And they grow their own herbs right here!

I have been going to Chaparral Dental since 2010 and I can't believe I have not written a review.  Dr. Martin Tricoli is the best!  I brag about them all the time and everyone I've referred, loves him and his wonderful staff.  Chrisi, the first person you see when you walk in, is great!  Super friendly, sweet and remembers little details about you.  You're not just a number to them. I highly recommend Chaparral Dental!!!!

Complimentary salted chocolate chip cookies!!!!!  OMG!!!!  Tuna sandwich, kale salad, Mother Earth on toast and the shattered potatoes with lebni are mouthwatering awesome!  I have yet to try their egg salad...it is always sold out when I get there!!!!  Anyway, great food, friendly staff and great atmosphere!  Will go back over and over again!!!

Let me start by raving about the salsa bar!!!!  OMG!!!!  Pecan Salsa, strawberry salsa, YUM!  I had their La Condesa veggie taco...it was delicious.  And we got there around happy hour, so, the cervezas were only $2!  Everything about this place was great...food, drinks, prices, decor.  I'm giving them 4 starts because even though they only had one other couple there, the service was slow!  Speed it up...and you will earn 5 stars!!!  Please don't change the menu.  This is truly gourmet mexican food with a twist.  Gracias!!!!!
