I bought gift certificates for my girls here for Christmas. I thought I was going to pass out in there from the fumes and couldn't wait to get out...but maybe that's one of those suffering-for-beauty things you girls do.  I DO NOT recommend bringing a young person here.   My 10-year old daughter tends to peel her toenails back, so when she went to get the pedicure, the lady working there starting going off on her. "I can't work with these!". She went on and on and ON about how horrible her nails look.  Kids are fragile at this age, and even though she doesn't cry very much, the experience brought her to tears.  I don't care how well you do nails, don't treat your customers like crap.

Be a man. Go to a real barber shop. At Joe's, you'll rarely get your hair cut by Joe, though you will see him every once in a while (this guy has been cutting hair for over 65 years). Instead, you'll choose from one of 8 barbers there to try and find your favorite one. Plan on seeing a lot of manly men who talk about sports and politics. Don't plan to see any fashion magazines, don't plan to pay with your credit card (cash only), and don't plan to get your scalp massaged before your cut. Do plan to get your neck and sideburns shaved with hot shaving cream and a straight razor. What else would you expect? You're a man.

These guys are great. From the moment I stepped in, they treated me with care and concern, which is what you want when you're injured.  That's all you need to know, but if you want to hear why I love them so much, read on...  I had been training for a marathon when an IT band injury struck on one run at mile 16. I could hardly walk when it struck. I rested, then tested it out a few days later, but couldn't get past 3 miles before it came back. I was devastated. I figured all my training was for naught as I only had three weeks until the marathon.   I decided to try PT, and I feel lucky I found Preferred Rehab. After going to them three days a week for three weeks, I asked them if they thought I should go for the marathon. I had done a few 4-mile runs without pain, but I was not sure at all if I could run longer distances.   They didn't give me a sure answer, but they said I had made progress and didn't tell me NOT to do it. They taped up my knee and wished me luck.  I went through the evening before the marathon going back and forth about dropping out, but eventually decided to go for it.   I finished in 4 hours and 14 minutes.  Thank you Preferred Rehab.

Cook was great like last time. Kids loved the fire, the fish, and the food. The service was friendly, but mostly absent, even though we were one of the the only ones there at lunch. Maybe because the gratuity was already baked into our bill? I took the whole fam, and with 6 people or more, they add 18% for a tip.

Sometimes it's hard to tell how good a company is until something goes wrong.   We had a commercial door installed at my carpet cleaning company. Everything went great from the quote to the installation. Good communication and good service.  Unfortunately, the chain pull on the door has given us issues.  FORTUNATELY, this is a top-notch company that responded quickly to my complaints and fixed the issues, even though it was a year after we did the installation of the door. Great customer service.
