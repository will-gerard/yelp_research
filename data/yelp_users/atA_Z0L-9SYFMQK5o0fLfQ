If you are in the area this is a great hidden delight, The ingredients are the freshest I have had before the "Lettuce, tomatoes, Onions" etc are worth trying even if you do not normally care for them.

Bad customer service, only go here of you have to. Buyer beware.

This has been my corner store for years. 20 years ago it was Manuel's. It still has that great small town store feel. And great fountain drinks. This is a great highlight of the community, I am happy to have grown up a mile from this store, Growing up I have seen some celebrities film movies there, Alan Alda, Luke Perry, Lilly Tomlin, Great place.

At one time I was a frequent visitor to this location, I work the graveyard shift so my lunchtime happens when everyone else is closed. I only visit this location once a week now. I always order the Southwest Salad,this morning 9/19/15 around 1 am I pulled in and ordered my salad, the girl lets call her (lil smiley flacka) not her real name but she sounded like she had never worked in public before but I made my order and pulled around to the window and she just put her hand out to take my card, and gave it back and said "here you go" I was like okay? So as I waited a male voice "sounded like a young kid" was shouting things at random, I could hear another customer placing an order thru the speaker when they finished the girl that took my card and would be handing me my salad soon "yelled"out to someone sitting in the office and a guy standing behind them "WHAT THE F***" except she said the actual word. The guy that I am guessing was preparing my food never stopped yelling things from the back.   I worried that if the people are obviously too immature and under qualified to do their job then they are probably the kind of people that would mess with your food. And sadly I saw what looked like a manager was sitting in the office while this was Happening.

I have been a CVS customer for years, I moved close to this pharmacy, Honestly at first the pharmacy techs upset me but now I am used to the awkward lack of customer service. I am happy that after months of asking they now apply my 25 dollar discount card. Well I don't take no for an answer anymore, I could change locations but [why I am having laser surgery done to my back so hopefully I will not need to go there every month.  Maybe try another place, But if it is best for you, Just stand your ground.  ***update*** I dropped This place. The jerks finally pushed me over The edge months ago. I moved My scripts over to Walmarts pharmacy . I have not had an issue since.

This has been one of the worst Circle K's since the day it opened years ago, the parking sucks, the floor is always sticky, the countertops are always disgusting covered with soda spills, old straw wrappers, used napkins and all of the condiments that splattered everywhere days before. The clerks are I have dealt with over the years are either too old or look like they are fresh out of prison and have no customer service skills. Expect a line every time and don't expect other customers to use common sense, I have never been there without the store being crowded (I have lived out here for 36 years) it was terrible when it was Elmers' Across the street "if you know what that is you are awesome"  My advice is to use the QT across the street, they are always busy but the parking is free flowing and plenty of it. Great customer service and never a wait. Same riff raff but they move you thru so fast you hardly deal with them.

Scam alert! Don't trust the warranty! Once you own it Its yours. The quality is not that great especially if you plan on sliding it in and out of your pocket l but that is not even my complaint today, I was told multiple times that if I bought a new phone to save the old skin and they would put on a new one for the labor of 10 dollars a side. I brought my phone back after changing to a smaller iPhone the first salesmen at the NW Ghost Armor Kiosk told me it's a lifetime warranty but only for the same phone type. I guess you're expected to keep the same iPhone for life. Like that is going to happen. Don't refer anyone to them ever!

Best Gas Station in the area, it's always clean, they have great parking, easy access to the fuel pumps, they take care of the simple things like always having a squeegee/water/paper towels in the fueling area, the bathroom, floors and countertops are always clean. If you are in a hurry you know you will always be in and out quick with a friendly employee.   Go here and avoid the Circle K across the street at all cost.

I don't know how else to put this but I picked up a burger here after a little gambling at the casino and when I got home and unwrapped it............  There was a very long black hair in between the bottom bun and meat. Thank goodness I add extra mayo. So gross. Love the franchise but could never eat at this location again.

Terrible service even with an appointment. I expected the customers to be "ghetto" and the lobby to have crying babies with mothers more worried about their cell phones then telling them little abominations to shut the hell up. But the employees are just as bad. No respect for the customer. You are just a number to these people. Make an appointment, come early as possible to avoid the trash and bring earplugs.  Don't be surprised if the lady with 15 kids gets preferential treatment over you. And protect your valuables.
