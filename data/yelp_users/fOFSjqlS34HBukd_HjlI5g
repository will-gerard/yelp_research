Went with the family for something new. Ordered the house special Molcajete, all I can say is WOW.  It had shrimp, octopus tomatillo sauce, beef, chicken and fried fish. Every food group you could possibly imagine! :)  We go the green sauce, the red sauce is a LOT spicier than I expected. If you want delicious Mexican food you can't beat Moriscos Play Hermosa. Don't be afraid of the location, my wife and I were a bit worried as it does seem like it's in the middle of nowhere and in a shadier area but well worth it!.  Make sure to check is as well and get that free slice of cake (we grabbed the coconut one mmmm).

Went to this place because we had heard they had some of the best roast pork/roast duck. Well people were right, the wife and I picked up a roast pork plate and roast duck plate. Both were delicious. They gave us a lot of rice (which was flavored we think).  The decor was lacking but hey the food is what makes the place right?  If you're looking for authentic roast pork or roast duck, this is the place to get it at.

Saw this on a Groupon offer awhile and decided to give it a shot. Had the Teriyaki beef with rice. It was awesome: tender, juicy and flavorful. The slaw that came with it was also delicious. However the true star of the meal was the dessert. They had a macadamia nut cake with coconut pineapple ice cream *DROOL is all I can say. A perfect ending to a meal. Will absolute be coming back!

Great customer service and I'm usually in and out pretty quick with any appointments etc. The place does need a quick renovation as the tables and furniture is starting to look worse for the wear.

Had been to this place awhile ago (probably previous owners or before they remodeled) and was ok with the food but it was a bit dated (and there was a bug on my table).  Years later came back with a coworker and wow have things changed! They've since redecorated and it's super clean now (no more fear of bugs).  The pad thai I had was delicious and coconut ice cream was awesome. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to get a Thai fix.

Went here for my birthday. Tried the margarita pizza, chocolate cake, and the caramel salted bar. Let me start with the pizza. It was absolutely delicious and was cooked perfectly (nice golden brown bottom, and the crust was awesome). The chocolate cake was honestly the highlight of my meal as it was oh so chocolatey and moist. The ganache that it was layered with was rich but not too rich. Lastly the famous salted caramel bar is my only lowlight (I know people will not agree with me). The bar itself was a bit too salty for me and wasn't that good. I might try it again in the future but dented an otherwise perfect meal at Liberty Market.

Some of the best dogs I've had in Arizona. Tried out the regular hot dogs, and all beef jumbo.  Both had great flavor and a crunch to the outer skin (good char). I also ordered up the Loganberry shake but was not really a fan (especially for the price).  Had the onion rings, and they're delicious. They don't really feel oily etc.  Overall, will definitely hit up this place again.

Have used multiple pest control services as well as doing it myself throughout the years and through a recommendation decided to try out Bryant Pest Control from a friend.  Decided on the month to month cycle several months ago (no contract and no pushy sales). Bruce came out and was awesome in explaining what chemicals he was using and what to expect after the initial treatment and follow-up treatment (used to break the breeding cycle).  I haven't seen much activity outside since I've started using Bryant (similar to when I did it myself) and we I see and uptick in activity outside the in between services are no charge (awesome!).  Bruce even took down cobwebs and webs we have sometimes and is very punctual.  Will continue using Bryant Pest Control as they're awesome and Bruce is fantastic.

Went with my wife and son to grab some pastries. We ended up getting the earl grey and green tea cakes as well as curry pan. The earl grey/green tea tasted wonderful and was not overly sweet at all. The best part about both was that they really emphasized the flavor of earl grey tea as well as green tea and was not just an overly sweet cake.  The curry pan was light fluffy and has a very tasty curry inside. They tasted so good that we brought home more so we could have some later on :).   Overall, Arai Pastry is awesome and will definitely return. I think the only thing that may be a con is the pricing (it's pretty pricey for the amount you get).

The Lotus of Siam is hard to find as it's in a plaza that's indiscriminate and no clear signs on the street side. It was worth the scavenger hunt as the food was delicious. I ordered the Garlic Prawns, Drunken Noodles, and Coconut/Sticky Rice Dessert. The Garlic Prawns were fantastically garlic ridden and crispy/crunchy. The fry was perfect and the prawn meat itself was juicy. The Drunken Noodles while small in portion, had a great flavor and "dragon's breath" flavor. The noodles themselves were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewiness. Lastly, to round out my meal I had their dessert: coconut/sticky rice. The coconut flavored ice cream tasted fresh and the steaming sticky rice gave the perfect contrast to the ice cream. Overall, a great Thai food restaurant and next time I'm in Las Vegas, I will definitely be hitting this place up again.

Since I was short on time during my attendance of CES 2016, I decided on Burger Bar as it was close. I ordered the Baguette Burger and Skinny Fries. Ordered my burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly (nice and red on the inside). The juices were literally oozing out of the burger when I took my first bite. It had a great flavor and the baguette gave a perfect crunch (I love crispy bread). The skinny fries while they were tasty did not really wow me as much as I expected (especially after reading other reviews). They were cooked well but weren't as crispy as I thought they would be. They felt a tad undercooked in my opinion. Overall, a good experience at Burger Bar and wouldn't really hesitate to come back.

This place never fails to impress with the sandwiches they serve. I order either the #1 or the #5 without pickled veggies (not a huge fan of pickled veggies).  The bread is usually baked fresh and delicious. The grilled pork and various meats taste great. I also end up ordering the Lychee smoothie with every meal.  Even though you have to pay in cash (they have a on site ATM), it's worth it.  I would seriously give this place a shot if you have not already.

A good quick meal that tastes pretty good as well. I end up usually getting the jerk fried rice, and jade red chicken. Grab the black beans you'll thank me :).  The snicker doodle they give with your meal is delicious as well (love the after meal treat).  The only true downside is you'll be in a food coma by the time you're done with the meal (unless you get the bowl which is about half the amount of food).  Overall, check this place out. It's worth the visit.

I'm not sure if I'm jaded from the lack of truly delicious thai food after trying out so many different places only to be let down.  Yupha Thai did not start out good for me as the soup and salad they provided for lunch was bland and tasteless (like soy sauce mixed with boiling water).  I ordered the Pad Thai with beef and while it did come out piping hot (a good sign), the portion size was a little lacking. My dish had more veggies than actual noodles...  If you're looking for authentic Thai food that will truly hit the spot...you're likely to have to keep searching...

Seriously what happened Sushi Ken!?  Went in for lunch and got the Noodle Combination: Tsukemen and Dynamite Don. First off the Tsukemen tasted pretty awful, like dipping in tasteless soy sauce (that was just plain salty). Secondly, the noodles and sauce were both ICE cold...I didn't order cold soba noodles...  The Dynamite Don looked like it always did but this time, there was VERY little rice on the bottom. It tasted more like I was drinking mayo sauce with some seafood...  Not really coming back anymore, it would seem that Sushi Ken has been going down as of late. Will have to get my lunch fix elsewhere from now on.

One of the coolest places to watch a movie in comfort. Full reclining chairs and the on call food service is a huge plus. The only downside is if you're shorter (like I am), the seats sit too low and the divider walls get in the way of the bottom quarter of the screen. No way to adjust seat height so my wife and I were kind of stuck.  Your best bet if you're shorter is to grab one of the side seats (you have to reserve seats) that allow you to see the screen at a bit of an angle to avoid the divider wall.  Overall a good experience with the only thing keeping this place from getting a 5 star rating from me was the lack of height adjustment :).

Went with the family for some dim sum and wanted to see if Phoenix Palace had gotten better since our last visit. Ordered some shrimp egg rolls, har gao, shu mai, chow mein and Baked BBQ pork buns. The egg rolls were really oily, the har gao had an odd flavor to the shrimp, and the shu mai didn't taste meaty (more fatty). The Baked BBQ pork buns were good though. The worst dish I had was the chow mein. It was severely overlooked and had no "dragon breath" flavor to it. If it were only the dishes I might have just given them an update of 2 stars but their customer service was horrendous.   Before we were seated my wife asked about an open table (4 seats) and why it was given to a party of 2 (we were a party of 3) that came after we did. All the person at the door directing people to tables said was WAIT A MINUTE in a very unapologetic and rude tone. When we were finally seated we waited a very long time before we even got our water. Many of the waiters and waitresses which we asked for water/tea either ignored us or just looked at us in disbelief.   Would highly recommend you look elsewhere for dim sum, unless you want poor dim sum quality and rude service. Looks like our time away has just given Phoenix Palace he opportunity to get much worse.

Ordered the diamond ice small with my wife and son. The fresh fruit toppings were absolutely delicious and combined with the fresh mocha as well it was refreshing on a hot summers day. They also put a heaping helping of red beans gave it just the right amount of sweetness.  For the price, the diamond ice dessert is a steal and very tasty. Will definitely be coming back in the future for more.

Seriously, the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona. This place is like a diamond in the rough. We had the Orange Chicken, Beef Chow Fun, and the soup of the day (daikon and pork I believe). Absolutely delicious! The place was constantly filled with people. The service was spectacular.   Will definitely be back!

So I have been going to Teharu for about 2 years. I remember when there short lines and delicious sushi for a great price. At some point and time they started counting on quantity over quality. The portions got smaller and smaller, to the point where I went this evening and the salmon was literally paper thin. So essentially prices are the same but you get less. What?!  Service was not great as it felt like it was understaffed (big difference from the first time I went there).  The worst thing was the cleanliness. Tonight was the first time that I saw plates on the conveyor belt without covers on them, which was a big gross out factor for me.  I will not be going back until they fix the quality of the food and the service to the old standards of the past.

The wife and I ordered a few things from this place based on some reviews from friends. The boba milk tea was good. We had the fried smelt, some fried tofu, the pork rice and a beef roll.   The Beef Roll had good flavor but was definitely too oily. The fried smelt was good at first but then all of a sudden some of the pieces were very bitter...not sure exactly why...  The fried tofu was good but the pork rice did not have much flavor and was was dry :(.  Overall, I would hit up this place for the milk tea boba and some fried tofu, but that's about it...

Ordered the basic house Pho and egg rolls. They were delicious. Service was great and it was very fast. One of the only downsides is it's a bit more expensive than other places I have been to that taste just as good.  Look forward to hitting up this place more often in the future.

Ate here for lunch before a movie and was craving some food. Picked up the lunch combo (almost $10 yikes) with chicken katsu and mandoo. The katsu itself had a nice fry but the chicken was pretty dry. The mandoo (only 4 small pieces) wasn't that great (again good fry though, just flavor wasn't there). They provide 4 sides which I had their Japchae which didn't taste very good (no sesame flavor). Their marinated bean sprouts also didn't taste that great (again missing sesame flavor). Lastly their potatoes actually tasted pretty good, great marinade.   The workers seemed very disinterested in serving, and honestly just didn't seem happy.   I wouldn't recommend really coming back to this place unless you're looking to overpay for not so tasty food.

Had happy hour at this place with some coworkers. Ended up having the teriyaki boneless tenders (99 cent special!). They were juicy and fried to perfection. Also picked up the hungry monk nachos which were gone before I knew it. Lastly great beers on draft. Ended up having the Black Market Hefeweizen, deliciously fruity. Will definitely come back!

Stopped by to pick up some dinner on the way home and was craving some curry. Ended up grabbing the yellow curry with tofu. It was absolutely delicious with just the right amount of kick and good amount of tofu. Will definitely hit up this place again when I have a craving for Thai. Just make sure you're patient as I believe it's a one man show with the owner acting as the waiter and chef.

Really good froyo. Had the original tart and it was great (topped with Mochi that wasn't stale also a good plus). I think the only downside was the gelato (didn't look really fresh...). All in all would come back for the froyo.

I actually prefer this Harkins now over the one at Chandler Fashion Mall. Less crowding and you can dish out your own butter from their dispensers.   Clean bathrooms and theaters were great and the food selection is better than that of Chandler Fashion Mall's Harkins.   Only downside is be seats are a bit uncomfortable for those of us who are shorter (5'7").   Overall, this is going to be my goto theater for watching the latest and greatest movies that get released.

Probably the best hand pulled noodles you can get in town!  I usually order the XO Sauce Beef Noodle Stir Fry (Shaved Noodles always shaved noodles!). Their pan fried dumplings and salt and pepper fish dish is also awesome.  They do have a viewing window where you can see the incredible skilled chef pulling the noodles apart.  Lastly, I normally finish the meal with a Boba milk tea (delicious).  All in all, you're not going to be disappointed with this place!

Recently purchased a Groupon in order to try out the Chandler BBQ Company.  I had heard good reviews of the place so thought I might try it out.  I ordered the sampler platter while my coworker ordered a BBQ salad.  The total ended up being approximately $22 (incorporating the Groupon).    When I got my plate I was shocked to see that not only was my sampler platter approximately the same quantity of meat as my coworker (who had paid half the price for the dish) but my 2 sides of fries one was normal size while the other was half the quantity of the first.   The food was also not that great (my sampler platter meat was pretty dry).  Will never be going back and honestly if you are looking for a good deal and good food this is probably not the place for you.

While at CES 2015, went with a friend to check this place out. I ordered the "gold standard" burger and the sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the sweet potato fries were cooked perfectly as well. Ordered a side of garlic aioli for dipping (wonderful taste). I skipped the shakes but have had it once before (believe it was the grasshopper), they are a bit pricey (about $10 a shake without alcohol).  All in all would definitely return, but probably do what I did this time around and skip the shake.

Had to try out Cyprus Grill finally. Ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and Greek Fries combo meal for lunch.  The chicken was cooked well and it was surrounded by fresh veggies and a great sauce. The Greek Fries were different than the ones I have seen in the photos (crinkle cut fries instead of straight). They still tasted pretty good and with a heavy lemon taste (pretty refreshing instead of feeling heavy).  Overall, would definitely hit this place up again in the future.

Tried out some pizza at Spinato's this afternoon with some coworkers. Chose the "thick crust" Mama Spinato's pizza. Absolutely delicious is the only phrase I can really utter haha.  Spinach, garlic, and a sweet sauce covered my pizza in just the right amount. The crust was crispy on the outside and slightly soft on the inside (just the way I like it). Literally no burnt areas at all or undercooked sections.  Service was great (the servers kept asking us if everything was ok, always a nice touch). Will definitely be back!

Wanted to bring home some food for the in laws over some dinner and decided on Chou's Kitchen. Ended up picking up the spicy pig intestine stir fry, some frozen soup dumplings and the beef pies.   All were absolutely delicious (my favorite was the spicy pig intestines). I was surprised that the soup dumplings were so good after being frozen but they definitely know how to make them. Just like they told me, 15 minutes to steam it, and it's ready to eat.  Overall, one of the most authentic things I've ever had. Hit up Chou's if you want to grab some soup dumplings or spicy pig intestine stir fry. Oh and the beef pies were deliciously juicy too :).

Sometimes you need that pick me up at 4:00 AM and what better and cliche way than to hit up a Starbucks. I usually grab a Iced Coffee in the morning and the friendly staff always greets me and makes the event personable.   After a few times, everyone there will start calling you by your first name (crazy with the amount of customers they get).  Overall really enjoy coming here and grabbing a morning wake up call.

Hit up this place with some coworkers since it was relatively close. Had the Chicken Sandwich and onion rings.   Was not really impressed with the sandwich. The Chicken was dry but at least the ingredients tasted fresh.   The onion rings were good, but not anything too special. My ending bill without having soda or a shake was around 9 bucks. For the price it was a decent meal but I probably wouldn't come back to this place. Smashburger is definitely a better choice and around the same price.

Seriously the best Gelato I have had ever. I have not been to Italy yet so once I go there this statement will probably be retracted but for now it sticks.  My wife and I tried the Pistachio and Roasted Almond flavors and loved both. The pistachio actually tastes like pistachios (instead of most Gelato places making it taste like almonds). They do have somewhat of a line most of the time but it's tolerable. I would say that the way the counter is setup does not really help customers as it only lets you see the flavors right about when you are expected to choose. I wish the counter setup was different.  Overall if you want delicious Gelato this place is the shop to hit up, just expect a line and some frustrated individuals behind you as they can't see all the gelato they'll have access to.

Ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Samosa Chaat. The Paneer Tikka Masala was creamy but a bit too spicy for me (not enough Paneer as well). The Garlic Naan was deliciously garlicky and toasted quite nicely. The worst was the Samosa Chaat, it was soggy and tasted odd...  Overall, probably would be coming back to Bay Leaf Cafe unless I'm REALLY craving Indian food and no other Indian places are open.

Probably some of the best wings I have ever had. My favorite sauce is the Honey Habanero.  My wife and I ended up going when there was a special (60 cent wings), delicious and cheap :).  If you want to try out multiple flavors they do have a rule that a flavor can be applied to every 3 wings which is pretty good and allows you to try a lot of flavors quickly.  Overall the wings were crispy, and delicious and will definitely come back.

Some of the best BBQ I've had (other than my trip to Texas). I love the Cutter's Choice and Moist Brisket. The loaded potato with chopped meat is killer (on your diet as well if you're on one).  All the staff is friendly and attentive. Overall great BBQ if you're looking for it, just make sure you're not counting calories when you come to this place, it'll absolutely destroy your diet haha.

Wanted to stop off real quick for some dessert. Ended up grabbing some pistachio and coconut gelato. It was delicious! The coconut was especially good, the pistachio I have had better at other places but it was still good.  Make sure to check out the chocolate water fountain cause it's huge! Next time I'm going to grab some chocolate desserts (cupcakes, pies etc.)

Seriously a tasty crepe can be had here. Ordered the Papa K savory crepe and it was delicious. Also picked up the chocolate chip cookie (theoretically given the size it was practically 2 cookies). It was flaky and oh so chocolaty.   Service was excellent and the waiters/waitresses were super nice. The only downside is given that this place is so popular, expect a wait for your food. My only suggestion is try and beat the rush, your stomach will thank you.

A hidden treasure in the area, my wife and I decided to try this place out after seeing the menu on the wall.   Our fish soup that was given to us was delicious. You could really taste the fish and thank you for not just making a soup with just a powder base.   Secondly we ordered the Preserved Meat Clay Pot (extra crispy make sure to request for that). It was delicious, obviously not the healthiest thing, but tasty nonetheless. It does take awhile to make and they warn you (25 minutes), but it's worth the wait. The rice comes out nice and crispy and the preserved meat give the rice and veggies a wonderful taste.  Overall, will definitely come back.

Wanted some authentic Thai cuisine and had heard a lot of good things about Chanpen Thai Cuisine. Ordered the Thai Tea, Yellow Curry, Pad Thai, and Drunken Noodles. All were delicious. The Drunken Noodles were the only spicy dish I ordered and it had great flavor and texture. The Pad Thai also tasted great and the noodles were cooked wonderfully. The Yellow Curry had a great consistency and flavor, something that I would liken to making a great coconut curry without using too much coconut milk.  The Thai Tea was excellent and given the price was a good serving size (unlike other places I have been to where I literally have paid $3.00 for a cup of ice).  Would definitely come back for Thai food, only issue is it's so far away from where I live haha.

Went with a friend cause we both thought it would be cool to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We weren't disappointed. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with assured cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, and avocado. It was cooked to perfection and tasted really good. For my side I had the Truffle Parmesan Fries which were really tasty but thought the price ($10) was a bit steep for what I got. Lastly for dessert picked up the Shake #4 Creme Brûlée pudding + Oreo Shake + Oreo Cookie. It tasted fantastic :). All in all the experience was really good and the customer service was great. When I come back next time I'll probably skip on the Truffle Fries as they weren't really that good to warrant the price tag.

Had a Five Guys open up and wanted to try it out (to see what the fuss is all about).  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with cajun fries. The burger was overly oily in my opinion but had a good taste to it.  The real shocker was the amount of fries you receive with your order. There were TONS in just the regular size order. They were too undercooked in my opinion, but the spices were good.  Now that I've given it a shot, I'm not sure I'd go back unless I was in a bind or SUPER hungry...

Have been hitting up Rubio's for my fish taco fix, but the wife wanted me to try out this place. Lucky I listened to her cause the food was awesome. It's fresh cuts and fried well. The prices are comparable, but the thing that stood out to me was the delicious selection of sauces they provide.  I personally like the Chipotle and avocado sauce. It's unlimited so make sure you don't overload on it :).  Will definitely become a regular at this place.

Ordered the Crab Puffs, Duck Fried Rice, Singapore Style Noodles and Walnut Shrimp. All of the dishes were pretty flavorful and delicious. The Singapore Noodles really hit a note with me as it had that great "wok" flavor and were the drier style stir fry. My wife really like the Duck Fried Rice as well. Overall, great place for food and the only reason why I dinged the place one star is because the prices were a bit higher than expected.

Landscape maintenance is a pain especially when you're like me who's gone through several with varying results (and in one case the guy took my check I left on the front door and only completed half the work).  Found Chris through a neighborhood Facebook page and I was wary at first due to past experience but I was proven wrong.  Chris did a great job clearing out my front and backyard (I'm leaf free for the time being).  What's awesome as well is there's no language barrier so communicating exactly how I wanted things was easy. He executed to exactly how I wanted things (detail oriented).  If you're looking for a landscape maintenance company, I highly encourage you to consider Chris from RealTree Landscaping.

Stopped by cause I was craving some Tsukemen (we don't have really anyone in Arizona that has this). When the meal came out my expectations were immediately met from a look standpoint. Pretty thick and flavorful broth and the noodles were nice and firm. The Chasu slices had a good amount of balance between fat and meat and once you placed it in the broth it instantly became a melt in your mouth texture.  The soft boiled egg was a little overdone but I'll forgive Ramen Tatsu just because it still tasted good.   Overall, a great experience at Ramen Tatsu and the closest I can get to true Tsukemen.

Wanted to hit up a new Indian food place and decided on the Curry Garden. At first glance, the inside is not exactly glamorous but again it's about the food right?  I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhatura, and Garlic Naan. It was delicious! There was plenty of Paneer in the dish (deliciously fresh) and the sauce was great. The Bhatura was made very well, but make sure you eat it when it's hot (so good for dipping). The Garlic Naan was good as well, with a generous amount of Garlic.  All in all this place had great food and service, although the design inside was not great, it was clean.  Look forward to coming to this place again if I need my Paneer fix :).

Was craving a dessert and decided on shaved ice cream. Ordered the Green Tea with Red Beans and it was absolutely delicious. I noticed a strong Green Tea flavor from the shaved ice cream and the red beans gave it a nice rounded sweet flavor (Green Tea tends to be lacking on the sweet side normally so by adding Red Beans it sweetens the deal, great combo).   The dessert was served in a clean cup(which is normally difficult given the nature of shaved ice cream) and it looked beautiful. Service was fantastic and would be hitting up this place again next time I'm in town.

Ordered the half Hawaiian and Meaty Italian. Service was great and delivered very quickly. The 11" size is perfect for 1 serving and the one price with unlimited toppings is a nice touch. It is pretty much like a pizza place that is done Chipotle style.  At $7.95 it's not bad at all for what you get. My pizza was cooked beautifully and tasted delicious.  One of the only true downsides is it's a thin crust pizza (essentially a pita pizza really). Would be great to have a pan option, but that would probably take much longer to bake.

Tried out this place as it's close to work. The inside is nice and clean. Ordering was a breeze as the menu is quite simple.  Ordered the dry vermicelli with beef. The noodles were cooked well however the beef was overcooked and too chewy. The portion size was not very large especially given the price of the meal. Normally at other restaurants if you order without vegetables (the bed of veggies on the bottom of the dish), they tend to give you more noodles. However it was not the case here.  Overall, it was too pricey for what you get and the flavor was lacking. Will likely not return.

I had high expectations for this place based on previous reviews but they seriously fell flat once I tried it. Ordered the signature nachos and three tacos with carne asada. The steak inside the tacos were cold (really cold). The tacos themselves did not have much meat in them at all :(. The nachos were better but still with cold meat sprinkled over it, ruining the taste for me. The taco shells which I thought were fresh, tasted cold and a bit stale.   Overall, would not really recommend this place...really wish Rienda's had not closed down :(.

Always wanted to try this place out with my wife. We ordered the crawfish (fresh) boil with the most popular sauce ( a trio ), and fried shrimp with fries. The crawfish were delicious and had just the right amount of spices and flavor. The best part was that the sauce that was left over went awesome with some white rice afterwards. The fried shrimp was also perfect fried and juicy. The Cajun fries were just the right amount of spiciness and taste, while not being overpowering.   Overall, I will definitely be returning but will try out the shrimp boil instead (crawfish while tasty, doesn't have enough meat for my taste haha).

Quite possibly the best Thai food I have had in a long time and at a buffet no less! I tried their pad thai, panang curry, red curry, thai basil chicken, and flat noodles. The flat noodles and thai basil chicken were probably my favorite. The flat noodles were cooked perfectly and had a slight sweetness to them. The thai basil chicken had a kick that was awesome and went really well with plain rice.   The Panang Curry was deliciously peanut buttery and the red curry was pretty spicy but had a great amount of flavor as well.   Overall, given the price tag combined with the amount of choices provided at Reign of Thai it's a no brainer to 5 star this place.  I will definitely be back and with a bigger appetite so I can try even more of their selection.

Decided to visit this place because my wife and I heard it practically had a cult following.   With a 5 star average review it has to be good. I ended up getting the Tony Soprano and my wife grabbed the Bella. First off the online photos do not due justice to the size of this sandwich. It may be 8 inches but it's practically 4 inches across. We both could have done with sharing one sandwich. They both were delicious.   We also had their fries of which we were much less impressed. There wasn't really any seasoning...healthy though since they're baked.   Well definitely visit again but recommend skipping the fries.

I saw that this place was opening up and decided to try it out with some co workers. Ordered the peach iced tea which was good and had the jalapeño burger. It was quite a large burger but overcooked in my opinion. Sadly they do not allow you to order the burgers medium. The fries were standard.   I would say this place is ok to try once but not likely a place that will visit again.

Henry's Private Kitchen is the pricier version of Henry's Kitchen. They serve some "fancier" dishes that usually have a bit of flare (not really street food).  I ordered the fried tofu with pepper and the minced pork rice bowl with my wife. The dishes were quite large and seriously tasty. Service was quick and the restaurant itself was clean and tidy.  My only issue was the price which is higher than I expected when I first saw the menu.   I actually prefer Henry's Private Kitchen over the regular Henry's restaurant which serves more along the lines of street food type dishes.

One of the best places for Boba in the area. Not only do they have boba but they have pudding milk tea!  Boba was cooked perfectly and the pudding was delicious. The milk tea that I had there was delicious and the boba was soaked in honey and brown sugar I believe.   The place used to be Lollicup but I think they got a lot better after switching and losing the franchise.  If you're looking for great tasting boba milk tea or even better, pudding milk tea, the Yes Cafe is hard to beat in the area.

Went today with the family as we were craving indian food. Ending up doing their lunch buffet. They had a great selection of the usual lamb, chicken, and vegetarian dishes. My personal favorites of all the ones I tried was the Paneer Shahi and the Chicken Tikka Masala. These two dishes accompanied by their Garlic Naan was delicious. Very garlicky and not too oily (some other restaurants make their Naan with quite a bit of lard).  The only thing that I could really ding this place on was the cleanliness. The linens looked like they hadn't been laundered in years (and were quite dirty) and some of the "clean" dishes I grabbed for on going to the buffet table wasn't actually clean.  Overall, I would definitely say give this place a chance based on the Indian cuisine but would really recommend you bring some wet wipes to clean your table beforehand.

Ordered the Thai Tea and basic house pho while here. Service was great and attentive and the pho was out of this world delicious. The noodles were cooked perfectly and there was a good assortment of tripe, and beef. The soup itself was hearty and filled with flavor. I did get a bit thirsty after eating the pho but that's to be expected as I believe they use MSG.  The Thai Tea was made well and had a good ratio of ice to tea. Will come by again when I'm in town.

Heard a new Boba place opened up in the Chandler Fashion Mall and decided to hit it up. On the surface the place looked trendy and expensive. A massive collection of flavors and available choices...a bad sign normally in my book.  I ordered a large (smooch I believe it was called) milk tea boba. The boba itself was overcooked in my opinion and there was something odd about the after taste to the tea itself. It oddly made my throat scratchy.   It is overpriced for the size of the boba milk tea (almost $5 for a large) and was not impressed with the tea or boba.

Made my first trip to Butcher Block Meats in order to get some quality meats for a get together. Tim was really nice along with all the other employees. The cuts of meat they had were quality (I grabbed some pork and ribeye). The only thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars is the price tag. I can grab a quality cut of USDA prime ribeye for about 14.99 a pound at Costco whereas it costs 19.99 here...For smaller amounts of meat I'd go here for convenience but if I'm looking for larger amounts and a better price I'd go Costco. Now the one exception is for specialized cuts like Hanger which Costco does not carry. All in all a good experience but still can't quite be my goto place for all my meat needs. If their prices would come down a bit more, they'd even beat out Costco in my opinion.

Sadly wanted to support a local business and Thai food is one of my weak points in the area. Had high hopes but this place let me down. Ordered the Pad Thai to go with mild spicy choice.  It wasn't so much the spiciness that I had an issue with, it was the lack of flavor...that's all I can really say sadly. The price was ok for the lunch special but will most likely not return due to the lack of flavor...  Time to move on and hope for another Thai restaurant to open up in the area...

Stopped by as I was curious on ice cream created via liquid nitrogen. I have went to stores like this previously and it didn't taste good.   I chose Green Tea and the flavor was subtle but tasty. It was very entertaining seeing how the ice cream is created. Honestly the only complaint I have about this place was the price. I picked up a small and they literally shaved the ice cream off the top of the cup to make it level. Being that stingy wasn't very welcoming and the price was expensive.  Overall, I would return but probably go up in size to get more for the money.

My wife and I needed out Indian fix so Lotus Deli was chosen. We tried the Paneer Butter Masala, Dahi Puri, and Bhatura. The Paneer Butter Masala deliciously creamy and flavorful (spicy too!). The Paneer was fresh and it went well with Roti and Bhatura we had. The Bhatura itself had a great fry and wasn't oily at all (another great sign!). Lastly, the Dahi Puri was probably my favorite, as they were filled to the brim with delicious yogurt/potatoes and a great sauce. While the Dahi Puri was very filling, it still gave you a lasting feeling of freshness when you finished.  Overall, will definitely be returning to try out some more Indian food goodness.

Had their donut holes and buttermilk donut. Both tasted just as good as the first Bosa I went to years ago. This new facility is larger and more spacious than the original so it doesn't look as "hole in the wall," but it still retains the same great taste. Truly the only downside is that with this new location being so close to home I'm going to need to dig deeper for the willpower to resist going here often lol.

Happy that a snow place opened up near where I live. This place was packed and I can see why. The Green Tea Icicle that I ordered was delicious with the red bean and mochi. It was very fluffy and airy which means the shaving is fine well. Honestly the only reason for the loss of a star was the price. My Green Tea Icicle was almost $7 for not so much shaved snow. The toppings was also small in comparison to other snow places I have been to.   Overall, like the place and recommend people try it out but don't be surprised with the high price tag.

Ordered the Cuban Pulled Pork sandwich with the wild mushroom soup. Both were deliciously tasty and even got a chocolate dipped strawberry to boot. Food feels fresher than Paradise Bakery but the lines are kind of crazy at lunch. I was also not thrilled with the portion size compared with the price. Seemed a bit more expensive than I thought other places were for the food.   All in all it was a great experience and will definitely return but maybe slightly earlier to beat the lunch crowd.

My wife and I decided to hit up one of the only Malaysian restaurants to have FINALLY graced the area. We were super excited and order the following: Roti Canai, Chow Kway Teow, and the Tea Tarik.  The Chow Kway Teow was delicious and had a good amount of wok hay or "Breath of the Wok." The flat noodles were very short in length probably due to the fact that they hand pull apart the noodles.  The Roti Canai was cooked really well however the curry sauce was a bit watered down, but the flavor was there. The Roti was cooked well but the piece was pretty small.  Lastly, the Tea Tarik was pretty good and but had a bit of a bitter aftertaste most likely due to being steeped for too long.  Customer service was really good and our waitress was very helpful.  Overall, BP Street Cafe is very authentic, but a bit pricey for the amount of food portions you get which kept them from getting the last star.

New buffet in the area and tried it out with my wife. Price is $9.99 and includes access to a Mongolian type grill, sushi, and the regular selection of Asian buffet items like Mongolian beef, sweet & sour chicken etc.   Since the place is new its in good condition and customer service is decent. The regular Asian food was ok with some of the dishes being warm, but most were cold. The sushi selection was good for a place like this including the standard nigiri but rolls were a bit scarce when you wanted  something that wasn't stuffed with raw fish.   They had plenty of desserts but they did not taste very good but looked nice in the presentation. They also had ice cream albeit not self serve. Had to wait for someone to come by to scoop some for me. After several minutes of the sever trying to scoop the hard ice cream, I ended up getting what looked like half a scoop and a sorry that he couldn't scoop more. I also noticed he did not wear gloves and his fingernails were dirty *shiver.   The Mongolian grill had a good selection of items to grill but their sauces were lacking in choice. I was only asked spiciness level and that was it. The sauce was lacking in flavor but the items were cooked ok.   All in all a good place to try out once but I wouldn't be returning for the price.

One of the best donut places I have ever been to in AZ. Their selection is vast and their standard glazed donuts taste delicious. But what truly sets them apart is that Cronut. The delicate layers that are included in each Cronut provide a unique new texture that is to die for. They have a variety of Cronuts with different toppings etc. My favorite honestly is the Cronut holes, they are like bite sized texture and flavor bursts.  If you're looking to try something new and tasty, definitely give Rainbow Donuts and Smoothies a try.

My favorite boba joint in Chandler. The tea is always made fresh and the boba is always perfectly made (awesome chewiness). My usual order is Honey Milk Tea Boba with 1/2 sweetness (full is too sweet for me).  If you're looking for great boba milk tea, Tea Street is the place to go.

Seriously let down by this place...  I ordered two Chicago dogs and they were pretty lackluster. The buns themselves were soggy, the peppers were HUGE and awkward to eat. The fries were decent and the shake was ok (strawberry).   Sadly this place is supposed to be known for their hotdogs, and they fell pretty flat here.   I won't be coming back to this place anytime soon...

One of the best places I've eaten in in a long time. The waiters/waitresses were SUPER kind and attentive. We grabbed the pad thai, drunken noodles, and Chon Thai rolls. The pad thai was delicious and cooked just right. The drunken noodles had a good amount of "wok" flavor and lastly the Chon thai rolls were very tasty. The rolls themselves were unique to Chon Thai. I haven't had that combination of chicken and what I believe was potato in a crispy roll before.   We also had the pleasure of trying that sticky rice and custard combination. It was wonderfully sticky sweet and salty. The best part was it came out nice and hot (just the way the dessert should be).  Overall, it was a excellent experience and will definitely be returning. If you're looking for a great new place to try look no further than Chon Thai.

Had family over and decided to grab some takeout and try out a new place at the same time. Ordered the whole Padak Chicken and the half Honey Butter Garlic Chicken. While the fry was decent the flavor was really lacking on both dishes. The Honey Butter Garlic Chicken lacked the most flavor but was juicy while the Padak Chicken had a decent flavor but was dry.  The family I had over really weren't impressed at all with the taste and the way the chicken was cut up made you really have to guess whether what you were biting into had a ton of bones or none at all.  The last nail in the coffin for me was the price which was pretty high for the amount of food you get and the flavor of the chicken dishes themselves. Overall, I sadly will not be returning based on the experience.

Went during the soft opening but visited again today so I could officially provide a review. Ordered #3 and #10 ~$10 for both. The #3 Awesome Trio was pretty tasty but very heavy (red and white beans). The #10 that my wife had was actually my favorite as it had a great combination of jelly, tapioca and grass jelly. It had this unique crunch that reminded me of water chestnuts. Overall happy to see that Bambu opened up in Arizona but the one thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is the price. For the size of drink you get the price seemed high. I'll likely still return but just not as often ;)

Had to try this place as it's brand new to Arizona. I ordered a Ham Deep Dish pizza (which they're known for) and I have to say it's a really tasty pizza. I would say it ranks higher than most of the other chain pizza places nearby. The staff was really nice and customer oriented.   The pizza itself was cooked perfectly and had a great crunch. Overall, would definitely hit up this place again for deep dish pizza. I think next time I'll have to try their jet bread...

I seriously had high hopes for this place. I went for lunch today with my wife and son. We ended up ordering the French Toast, Beef Pancake Roll, and Baked Fish Fillet and Cheese Rice. Once we ordered that is when all the troubles started. The dishes took forever to come. We asked twice for the status of our food, even as other patrons who came after us received their dishes first. After a long extended wait, we finally got our Beef Pancake Roll which was not oily but lacked flavor. The Baked Fish Fillet and Cheese Rice was hot but also lacked any flavor whatsoever (really just tasted like congee. Lastly, the French Toast that came out while pretty good flavor wise, was cold. They tried to give us food that was not even for out table (apparently it was curry meant for another table), insisting it was ours until another employee corrected the waitress. Overall, tasteless food and extremely long wait times really killed it for me at Asian Fusion Cafe. I would highly recommend not coming back unless you want to spend endless time waiting and then eat some cold, flavorless food.

This place opened up nearby in South Chandler and wanted to try it out. Ended up ordering the Caniac Combo for the family which had 6 strips, fries, two sauces, and coleslaw. The chicken strips were really good having a good crunchy coating, while also having a moist inside. The fries themselves were a tad soft but it was tasty. The sauce is where Canes shined really well combined with the chicken. It had a good tang to it that reminded me a bit of chic fil a sauce but actually tastier in my opinion. The coleslaw was good but nothing special. Overall, you should definitely try out Canes if you're in the area.
