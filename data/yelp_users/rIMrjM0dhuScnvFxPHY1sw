I don't know if it's worth wasting my very first ever 1 star review on US Airways, but I feel pretty slighted!  It's been two months and I'm still compelled.  ;)  I bought a 2 leg itinerary with US Airways operating the first leg through their Star Alliance.  My flight was delayed by an hour and late into Denver.  The connecting flight to Vancouver on United was two terminals away and I had no boarding pass yet (can't print boarding passes for connecting flights on a different airline, so I hear).  Needless to say, I was unable to make the connecting flight and needed to reschedule.  The folks at United got me rescheduled for the next morning but referred me to the US Airways desk to see about my hotel since US Airways' flight into Denver was late.  I'm still agitated that the CSR at the desk was on the phone for about 30-45 minutes "checking" on a hotel for me and then came back to inform me that they wouldn't be providing any accommodations since I had a 10 minute window to run through 2 terminals about 1/2 mile with my luggage to the United gate.  The 1/2 mile luggage run through 2 terminals wasn't part of my Crossfit routine and I'm out $80 for my own hotel room.  I give you one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.

CPC is a fantastic niche restaurant that will put your grandma's pot pies to shame.  I've ordered the majority of their pasty menu over the years and haven't gotten something I didn't like...  The only drawback is the time it takes to prepare the food.  Busy or not, if you didn't call your order in, you'll wait 20-30 minutes for your food.  This place is both meat-eater and vegetarian friendly, so it's a safe place to bring your group of hipster friends who disagree about diets.  Pricing is more than fair at about $10 per pasty.

Miles is the real deal.  Called iMobile around 7:30PM fully expecting to reach voicemail and hope for a visit tomorrow.  He answered and after a quick discussion of my phone damage he let me know he's finishing up a repair about a mile from my home and he came straight over 30 minutes later.  He's super friendly and repaired my iPhone in about 20 minutes right in front of me.  Repair came with a 1yr parts and labor warranty for the work done, which sealed the deal on my decision to go with him.  Definitely use his services rather than re-upping your carrier contract on a replacement!

My door spring broke this morning and locked my car in the garage.  I read a couple reviews on Yelp, including a bad one and decided I'd take a chance on their $25 off Yelp deal.  Zach was my technician. He was able to get me scheduled for a visit the same day between 4-7pm. Doorbell rang at 4:15 and Zach went to work. He did a full checkup on the door and gave me feedback about it's condition and performance.  He then replaced the broken part with no pressure to buy or fix anything else and charged exactly what he quoted in our phone call.  Solid service and friendly technician.

Thank you so much for your prompt and honest service.  I had installed my own thermostat after my previous one failed and I did an awful job.  Authority HVAC was able to expedite my home visit and the technician was very friendly.  After doing routine checks on my equipment and confirming there was no other issues, he corrected the wiring on my thermostat and my home is toasty warm now.  They billed exactly what they quoted over the phone to me beforehand.  I'd highly recommend these guys to anyone.
