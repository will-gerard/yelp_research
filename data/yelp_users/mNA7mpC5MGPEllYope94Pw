The restuarant was moderately busy when I first got there.   I did have to wait in line for five minutes before making it to the staging area.   They were out of chicken and it would be two minutes turned into about five.  I turned back and the line was now out to the door......   The manager was nice he comped my meal for the long wait I had to wait.....

Although the atomsphere was nice and quait, the wait time for a meal was long.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our food after we order it.   Also, I had the chicken quesadilla the chicken was so dry and overcooked I had to chew for ever to break it up.  I would not reccomend getting the grilled onions on it, makes it soggy

Honestly! Popeyes, is much better than what I had this evening.  The dirty rice was blah, and the chicken you don't have a choice between mild or spicy.  Needless to say the chicken left my pallet spiced out!   The combo was suppose to include Leg with a thigh or wing.  I got a breast and a leg.  Now to some people that's bonus but I'm not a white meat person.  I love my chicken dark.......  The dinner roll, feels that it came out of the package of a Kings Hawaiian Rolls  compare that to Popeyes, buttermilk biscuits  I'm dissappointed that if you want mac and cheese as your side you have to buy  that side.  It's not an option available for combos.     I'll have to try the mac and cheese next to see if it worth going there for that, but I would prefer my chicken from Popeyes....
