I love the blackberry bread pudding. It's addicting so careful. I'm all about the carnitas/chorizo skillet. Bring your appetite.

Service Department is a joke. Some guy named Roger, who's apparently the Service Manager but has the appearance of a carwash guy, was not only inept at dealing with a customer concern (a $43 DOLLAR OIL CHANGE) but had the customer service of a machinist. Worse, the General Manager (COOK) doesn't give 2 sh*ts about loyal customers - only new/used car sales. That's the biz. Rather go w/ a competent auto mechanic like Gene's where they don't screw you over for every last penny they can snake out of you. So long Freeway...

Actually, the service department showed me the price increase was due to labor cost increases, not oil. Nice try.

I was recommended to Dodge Electric by my sister. I'm happy to say that I was highly impressed by Dodge Electric and their expert services and fair prices. We hired DE to install our alarm system (they also provide monitoring), misc. electrical issues, and low voltage lighting for us. I can't ask for a better electric co.!  By the way, I do think its odd that "Joe M's" review of Dodge Electric is the ONLY review he's ever made.

Just about everything was overpriced except for my favorite dish- Filet de mi Tita! I've been to BC at least five or six times and I seldom wander from this dish. It's a must have!   The Horchata and agua de Tamarindo is smooth and cold. At least half the time, they've run out so better get there a little early.

I'm from Mexico where real Cochinita Pibil is from. Not gonna lie - it's pretty damn good. MG is pretty eccentric with it's guacamole (not a huge fan) but i somehow keep eating it. Don't ask... Anyhow, awesome patio off University and friendly service. Glad to have a place like this in Tempe.

Awesome flavor found in big juicy chicken strips coupled w/ an order of fries and you can't go wrong. Awesome little joint!

This might be one of the most unethical practices in the valley.   I originally contacted them regarding a small port wine stain that I have and asked if that was a possibility to be removed. They asked I come in and after a brief 3-4 minute "observation", they informed me they didn't provide that type treatment or "laser". Upon leaving, I specifically asked how much I owed for my 5 minute visit (mind you, they could've simply told me over the phone they were unable to treat my stain due to lacking the proper equipment) and a response of "oh, don't worry, you don't owe anything" was given. Months later, I received a $100 "exam" bill in addition to my medical insurance co. confirming a charge of service. When re-visiting the office, we were told we were incorrect in our view of my visit.   Sadly, I will never return and will advise any future patients to guard against costs stemming from this practice.   This type of unethical medical practice is a reason costs have escalated where they are today.

Update:   I went back and had one of the guys in the first two chairs fix my cut. I'll be going back just because of them.   Definitely expecting a better quality cut but then again I went with the chubby dude in the back who blamed the light on the cut. The other two guys cutting hair did a good job from what I saw.

We've been there for breakfast and dinner. Can't argue w/ the good reviews as we haven't experienced anything wrong yet. It's our neighborhood joint so we welcome it w/ open arms.

Finding a reliable and honest plumber is like winning the lottery. I was lucky enough to have found Simplex from a friend. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great plumber!

First visits to a new dental office can always be a bit nerve-racking. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease with the friendly staff. Even though I was running more than 20 minutes late, they didn't act like they were doing me a "favor" by still keeping my appointment (is it me or does it feel like most dentists think its a privilege for us to visit them instead of the other way around?). That actually meant a lot to me. The attentive staff were courteous, gentle (as much they could be with teeth cleaning), and friendly. They all seemed genuinely happy to be working there. I left feeling like a found a great dentist and facility I can keep going back to. And by the way, I watched Anchorman during my teeth cleaning. A more entertaining teeth cleaning session I know not!
