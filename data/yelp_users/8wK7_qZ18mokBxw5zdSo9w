An Arizona elite institution.  High academic and artistic standards. Quite challenging for students. Teachers are unusually highly communicative.

I only went because I had a coupon for a free Bacon Clubhouse Burger which was as expected... blah.  With all the wonderful Non Fast Food places to get a burger these days (at a fairly competitive price) why ever choose fast fast food?  Really?  Why?  I haven't been to McDonald's in about 5 or 6 years and no reason to ever go again.

Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).  Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.  Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)  Oh and order off the menu the "Cannibal Fries".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)

One of Phoenix's hidden gems!  No longer do you have to wait 2 hours to get Phoenix's best pizza at Pizzeria Bianco. Now you can go to Pane Bianco and get either pizza or a wonderful home cooked meal.  And, I do mean, a Home Cooked Meal... Old world Italian style with a kick!  One of my favorite places in all of Phoenix.

Never will you find someone who is better at this profession than Dr. Nemanic! He is the Total Package when it comes to health and well-being. I have been adjusted by over 75 chiropractors in 25 years and never have I encountered someone who is as good an adjuster, focused, able to solve the most difficult problems (acute and chronic) in the most intelligent and creative ways as Dr. Nemanic. Oh, and Dr. Nemanic happens to possess a trait that no one can learn in school (something you either have or not)... and that is, he actually CARES! So if you are looking for a chiropractor that can Really help, I honestly would look no further.

5 years and still going.  Dr. Nemanic is simply the best.  (See my review in 2011)  Newsflash... Not all Chiropractors are good, never mind great... And Dr. Nemanic is Great!  Brilliant mind and brilliant adjuster!  Just go and see for yourself.

Been here many times through the years. Warm atmosphere and enjoyable happy hours.  Often live entertainment on a weekday or two and on weekends as well.  Food quality is good and most meals are prepared well, served hot and commonly very good service.  Like any restaurant, some dishes are better than others... and a select few are pretty wow!  Overall, very good Italian for Phoenix... yes, I am from NY NY so I have been Super spoiled when it comes to truly amazing Italian food.

One of my favorite traditional (more NY style) Italian food here in AZ.  A total joint just like a mom and pop pizza place in NY.  My son's absolutely favorite place.  Service always very good.

Make no bones about it, there truthfully isn't a whole lot special about this place (in terms of food) but the empty peanut shells coating the ground, the vibe (it's often crowded), and the casual, inviting nature of the place is worth one star on its own.    Key advice: stick to the wings (excellent) and the burgers (pretty good).  Wander too far off the path and you may not feel the urge to come back.  No, not even with a trail of peanut shells to help you find your way.

Simply the hippest most fabulous coffee joint in Phoenix!  Jeff (the owner) is Passionate about his coffee (roasted fresh from raw beans every day - you can even watch them roast through the glass door in the back) and Katie (a truly gifted pastry chef) is equally as passionate about all the home-made (on-premises) pastries and delectables.     If you haven't been, you will all thank me!

Wow-A-Palooza!  Talk about a metamorphosis!   Jeff, you had the greatest coffee joint in Phoenix... now after this move/renovation you may have the coolest joint in the country.  Talk about hip, cool, and perhaps the warmest most comfortable place to hang out.  Nooks and crannies, little rooms, sections, all with their own vibe, feel and energy.  You have completely outdone yourself and everyone else man!  If you are someone who either has never been to Lux or haven't been in a long while, then you MUST GO (and go again and again and again to take it all in).    And oh, by the way... besides the comfortable atmosphere, both the coffee and food is over the top.  Katie (the chef), you're talents, passion and energy are appreciated by so many.

Michelle at the bar is a freakin' Savant!  I swear.  I think the last time I was here was about a year ago and she served me a meal that unfortunately had to be returned. I don't remember why because every meal I have had here has been excellent!  Seriously.   Anyway, she was so gracious about the problem I think she charged me 1/2 off the newly served dish (or something like that).    Well... I walked in today (again a year or more later) and she greeted me with a Big smile and said, "Andrew is it?". I mean, holy schnikees Batman!  How the heck?!?!  So, come to the bar and introduce yourself to Michelle.  Never mind the smile and the great service... she obviously won't forget your name.   Thank you Michelle!  You are appreciated.

I LOVE AMC and going to the movies however, theatre number 14 (can't speak for the other theaters inside) might have the most uncomfortable seating I have experience ever!!!  The seats are so upright that it is almost surreal.  And NO, they don't recline back.  I mean seriously folks... something is wrong.  Someone made a terrible mistake in installing these.    If you have a bad back or neck... Don't go!  Oh, and ALL the seats in #14 have this problem... I checked!  So my review for AMC is 5 stars but this theatre in particular... 1.  You guys gotta do something about this.

Healthy, nutritious fast food.  They even have a "500 Or Less" menu (500 calories or less).  Might be lower in calorie but I assure you not in taste or yumminess. I LOVE you ZoÃ«!  Will you marry me.. (Jeopardy music playing in the background).  5 stars for what it is... Fast Food.

From 25 years of experience frequenting Japanese restaurants... this is the best, most authentic place in Phoenix.  And, if you don't want to take my word for it, then take the entire Phoenix Japanese population.  They ALL eat here!  If its just the food you care about, this is the place.  If you are seeking a warm, inviting atmosphere with great service then this is clearly not the spot.  One last thing... while my review of Sushi Ken's food is terrific, Sushi Ken himself is unfriendly, never smiles, has less than zero personality, ignores children (while making sushi at the bar), and flat out does NOT like to be asked questions nor be spoken to.  Weird!

Tried something new today... first a Roast Pork Egg roll and then Spicy Korean Chicken. Now perhaps I am a bit of a Chinese (Asian) food snob being from NY NY however one thing you can take to the bank is this... DO NOT GET THE ROAST PORK EGG ROLL. Hands down the weakest by far I have ever had!  So surprising as I have never known Pei Wei to have anything terrible and this my friends was terrible.   OK, now the Spicy Korean Chicken.  Really just OK. While beautiful looking and presented, flavor wise... just mediocre.  Left feeling that something was missing... like perhaps a tinge more sweetness.   While tonight's meal will by no means preclude me from coming back, I certainly learned tonight what Not to order.

Can't say that I have dined at every Indian Restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area but I sure have dined at many... Yes, it's true I LOVE me some good Indian food.  We'll anyway, the point I was making (yes, the point!) is that so far, The Dhaba is the best of the best.  Perhaps the most expensive too but like they say, you commonly get what you pay for.   4 stars not 5 because I have been to London and the Indian food there is just off the chain!  If this was rated in comparison to all of London the folks at The Dhaba would not be happy with me as there would be one less star.  However, in all fairness... Best of Phoenix!  Thank you guys!

What a classy Yoga studio right in the heart of (mid) downtown Phoenix!  Wonderful choices of classes all throughout the day (some simultaneously - yes there are two very zen like rooms) and some very challenging and loving instructors. If you try it out you will not be sorry.

Not a bad thing on the menu and extremely reasonable (price wise).  And ironically, maybe the best pulled pork sandwich in the valley!  Atmosphere is rather dive-ish however in my opinion, it adds to the charm.

Classy joint. Great coffee however NOT conducive for laptop/work.  Very few outlets and the work tables they do have (WITH outlets) are uncomfortable/poorly designed.  Still, a hip, classy place on a beautiful/quiet street downtown.

The location of this little hot spot is in perhaps the hippest, most beautiful section of downtown Phoenix. Almost a European feel for the sectioned town and courtyard it is in - right next to Pita Jungle.   Love everything about this place except for one thing... If you plan on staying, it is perhaps the noisiest coffee spot on planet earth.  Still, that said, you need to go... Great coffee and wonderful homemade food.

I rated this "as good as it gets" because when it comes to vending... Automated Food and Beverage really is... as good as it gets.  Fresh foods, healthy alternatives, and... if you want to be bad, there are some delectable choices in that arena too.  And...purchasing these items are as easy as scan and swipe.  Seriously.  I can think of no other better vending system for an office/company and their employees.  Just fabulous!

Perhaps this was just a BAD night but I don't think so.    When we first walked in we there was no one to greet us.  We waited, and waited, and waited and then after about 7 or 8 minutes a young man dressed in jeans (under his but with his boxer shorts showing) without smiling said "how many."  No joke!  We wanted to sit in the dining room but apparently there was some private function going on so they sat us in the bar where the lighting was brighter than the sun.    We then (after about another 5 minutes) were greeted by male server who placed chips and salsa on the table.  And HE TOO was wearing his jean below his but with his underwear in plain sight!  I kid you not!  Overall, the service was poor at best... they were under-staffed and we had to get their attention for everything - water, more chips, more salsa, etc.  Oh, and we ordered a soup appetizer that they served at the same time with our entrees and thought nothing of it.  No apologies, no nothing... whoop, there it is!  Now the food... Wow... so salty and so bad.  I mean so bad that I can't even talk about it.  My meal, the "stacked enchiladas" was barely even edible.  I mean so salty it was almost sickening.  Honest.  Perhaps there was a fill-in chef this day because there was clearly a mistake.  And I could go on about the soup and the other meal but it really isn't worth it as it was all poor.  So very disappointed as we were told how great this place is/was.

Beautiful little warm spot in the Foothills.  Comfy, cozy... but still have yet to try the food.  Coffee was delicious but then I am not really a coffee connoisseur so take that for what it is worth.  Air temperature inside however is ridiculous!  The owner is obviously trying to keep his/her electric bill down; unfortunately however, at the expense of the customer.  The two times that I have come to drink coffee, work and hang out, I was dripping wet from sweat.  Honest.

Ok, you need to understand the meaning of what many of us lovingly refer to as a Shi!hole.  To me that means it is extraordinarily unimpressive visually but extraordinarily impressive in how good the food is.  While there is of course some variance on both of the factors the perfect place, again to me, is one that truly is a Shi!hole (like really not good) but the food may be off the chain. Made with talent, love and a gift to your mouth.    This place is textbook.  A total dive and tiny TINY but...  the BEST Thai in all of Phoenix.  Yes, you heard me right.  The BEST in Phoenix.  (They have a nicer location - not quite as good but very very close) same name - on 48th st and Ray in South Phoenix.    Go.  Just Go!

Sat at the bar on a busy Monday night and ordered the balsamic vinegar roasted Carrots and Broccolini.  Good not wow!  Nicely roasted but rather simple which is nice too.  Didn't get much of the balsamic but still enjoyable.  Then the Meatball Pizza. Please keep in mind that I have been incredibly spoiled when it comes to pizza being from NY and having traveled throughout Italy.  Overall, very good and a premium product. Sauce could have a bit more Pop however the understated tomato sauce let the very delicious meatball and caramelized onion flavor sing!  Crust/dough, also very well done but not the best I have had either.    Overall, very enjoyable and great service from Josh at the bar!  Well done guys.   Your Truly,   The Official Pizza Snob : )

Love LOVE this place.  You will too!  Same owner that owns St. Francis on Camelback.  Two tips:  1. Why wait an hour at Matt's Big Breakfast if you can get an even better breakfast here with no wait (yes, I have had every menu item!).  2. While the lunch and dinner menu has at least one item that will wow you, so too will the homemade desserts!  Order at the counter and then find a place to sit.  The beautiful food will somehow find you.

Now you may think you're not a hot dog person, but think twice. This place will convert just about any uninterested non-hot dog eating human. Who knew hot dogs cud be as creative & gourmet as this?  And like are you kidding me!  "The Bear" has peanut butter, cracker jacks, bbq sauce & gouda. How could this possibly be as delicious as my taste buds are telling me?!  You gotta check this place out!  Creative genius.

I've been a member for almost 5 years now and have absolutely no reason to ever stop paying my annual fee.  In fact, I LOVE Fill-A-Seat!  And yes... while their website is quite antiquated both visually and functionally, don't let that fool you!  The value here is immense!  Sign up and you will thank me.  P.S.  I would give 5 stars but holding back only a little because their website look, feel and functionality is very dated.  The service however (as I mentioned) is tremendous!

Very popular, upscale and somewhat pricey seafood joint that was very honestly mediocre.  Yes, I grew up on the east coast (literally the ocean - I lived in a beach house on Long Island for 4 years) so I have had amazing seafood and this was genuinely far from it.   I had the lobster bisque for starters because there were so many overwhelming reviews here in Yelp as to how amazing it is. Well, just as I expected, Arizonans unfortunately do NOT know amazing seafood (yet!) and the bisque was decent in flavor (not great) and definitely a little too heavy (too much cream).  If you really want the best lobster bisque in Phoenix go to The Kings Fish House in the Tempe Marketplace. Compare and you will notice a BIG difference.   For my entree, I went with the Gumbo hot bowl.  I ordered it with oysters added in at their suggestion.  Unfortunately, I received my bowl of bisque and the Gumbo at the same time however besides that there were NO oysters in my Gumbo - which we waited about 45 minutes for.    Now listen here folks... Perhaps this was a bad night but this was literally the worst gumbo I have ever had.  It was the right thickness and texture and it even had a nice smokiness to it however, there was almost no flavor. I even had my party of six taste it and everyone said it was tasteless.  Sooooo... If you like Gumbo or creole food, go to the Ocean Trail restaurant at the Talking Stick resort. Best gumbo and creole food in Phoenix!  Yes, way better than Pappadeaux!  Trust me.   P.S. My cousin ordered the Cioppino hot bowl and while that was much better, tastier (yes, I did sample some) it also was not anywhere near the best I have had.  My cousin and another guest who ordered the Ciopino said the same.   In sum... Yes, this place is amongst the best we have in Phoenix for seafood however, in comparison to honestly what is out there... It's nothing to write home about. Kings Fish House is genuinely much better.

Truly EGGceptional!  If you want your cake and eat it too (aka large portions without compromising one smidge of quality and deliciousness) (Ummm, of course you do!), then mosey on down to Eggstacy.  Many wonderful breakfast standards including just as many proprietary creations.  Speaking of which, just reading the menu alone becomes an exciting experience simply to learn of seemingly endless, delectable ideas your remaining brain cells have not ever contemplated.    Oh, and for those of you who focus calorie consumption... what you too have here is yet another form of having your cake and eat it to.  Quite a large healthy conscious selection that is surprisingly sizable, delicious and also... creative!    Move over Matt's Big Breakfast.  Your days are over easy.

In one of the most beautiful retail centers in all of Phoenix, this stylish, cozy lounge type restaurant offers some pretty decent Asian fare. Speaking of fare (in this case only fair) was the sushi.  Good not great.  If you want the best of the best (sushi) in Phoenix try (and see my review) for Sushi Ken in Ahwatukee.  With respect to the Korean, Chinese-ish fare that remains... Thank goodness it's better than fair.    In sum, the song ("Rock Lobster" by the B-52's) is better than the food - https://youtu.be/ofkzvM7Skxg (am I right or am I right or am I right?) however, it's worth a visit for the vibe and the Korean BBQ.  It's fun and decent.

Beautiful, classy spot outside and in, in downtown Gilbert.  Heard great things and after our experience for the most part this is indeed a place you'll want visit.  Some very good dishes here.    * Octopus appetizer was very good, * meatballs appetizer was excellent, * Big eye tuna excellent, * smoked duck breast was also delicious * rigatoni with sausage ragu was just ok * pappardelle pasta with pork also good not wow  Only complaint... Might have been the loudest restaurant I have ever been to!
