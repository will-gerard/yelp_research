MacAlpine's has such a great old school diner feel, it's like a nostalgic blast from the past in the heart of Phoenix. The ice cream is BOMB. I got a salad and my friend got a sandwich and they were just fine, nothing special but not horrible. Service again was fine, not great but not horrible. I would come back here for a dessert though, any day!

Ambiance - crowded on a Sunday morning, but it was a very short wait to get 3 breakfast burritos and a horchata. Tortillas were amazing, we got chorizo, eggs, and potato with sour cream and guacamole. The burrito was very big and filling. Horchata is creamy and delicious. Only drawback, there is no where to sit if it's busy, however, the food came out fast so that's not much of an issue. Green sauce is lacking spice but the red sauce was bold and spicy, just the way it should be. Definitely coming back here to try more off the extensive menu!

The doctor was very friendly and helpful, (we didn't see the main doctor but one who's last name started with a B, I think it was Berman but not 100% sure), and my little chihuahua was at ease around him. The visit was very affordable (used their Groupon!) and convenient. The office is nice as well. And hands down, the best nail trim my dog has ever had! I will definitely be coming back here.

I have been going to this Fry's for years and until today have not had any problems.  The ladies at the pharmacy were rude and not helpful in refilling a prescription I have been taking for 4 years now. I will not be returning to this pharmacy, which is quite an inconvenience as it is right near my house and have been going there for years.

This gym is a HOT MESS. No one re-racks their weights and there are water bottles/cups/paper towels/god knows what littered all over the floor. Seems like staff/cleaning don't care to pick up the garbage, either. Yes, it is ASU bro packed between 4-7, that's expected. I haven't really dealt with the staff, I was given a year membership as a birthday present so I never went through their sales pitch. No one on the staff is incredibly friendly or nice, but no one has been rude to me either.   This facility and their weight room equipment just needs to be updated. 3 squat racks is simply not enough. Granted, this gym is pretty small - the 24 Hour Fitness at Mesa Riverview is much bigger. I'm not even sure where LA could put another squat rack in their overcrowded weight room. Enforcing the re-racking of weights needs to be a policy. This place serves its purpose and I can get a good workout here but the minute my year membership is up I am going to another gym.   That being said, Diane's yoga class (I attend the Thursday evening at 8pm session) is amazing and she is a fantastic yogi. I will miss her classes.

Very disappointing office. Front office staff was rude to me, then made me drive to a different office location because of a scheduling error. I saw a PA, not a doctor, who did absolutely nothing to help/diagnose with why I went into the office in the first place. No transparency from administration at all about costs/billing, and when I called to inquire about my account about a month after my visit, was shuffled around on the phone and on hold for 20 minutes before someone finally answered my questions. Found this office on ZocDoc, never going back to them again.  Update to my review...just got off the phone after 2 hours of back and forth with my insurance and this god awful doctors office. A flu shot  here costs $106 and a useless visit with a PA costs $276...NEVER, EVER, EVER GO TO THIS OFFICE! oh and if you do happen to get someone on the phone after waiting for 30+ minutes, they will be rude. Crystal and Priscilla, this is directed to you.

The people at American Dry Cleaners are friendly and professional. Price is super affordable as well! I brought in two difficult fabrics, a velvet dress and a cashmere jacket, and they came back in perfect condition with all the stains gone. They were also able to rush the dress for me to be ready the next day since I was leaving on vacation and needed it ASAP, at no extra charge! I highly recommend them and will continue using them for all my dry cleaning needs.

Jon is amazing! Highly recommend him to anyone looking for a relaxing and affordable massage. He is very friendly and professional and is clearly passionate about what he does.

I've been here a few times now and it has always been a pleasant experience, I usually get a normal mani/pedi regular polish. This time I decided to go a little more crazy and I got a full set acrylic tips, almond shape, in a nude matte gel. Jimmy was doing my nails and he did an amazing job! I arrived around 6PM on Friday without a reservation and was seated right away.  My pedicure was great, as always (I just get the basic), and Jimmy spent a lot of time on my nails, making sure they were shaped how I want them, and giving me the exact color I was looking for. Definitely recommend!

Great customer service and my car is very clean! They were cleaning the drive through when I arrived so I had to wait about 5 minutes but the weather was nice so I sat on the little patio in front of the cafe.   I've never gone through a drive through hand wash car wash, but they did a great job. I got the $10 magic+ wash and a stamp card. The price included an air freshener (they gave me 3 choices, which was nice) and self vacuums. Something had dripped on my car and the drive through Cobblestone wash wasn't able to get it out, but the guys at Wash Wizard got it out! I also have some dried hard water spots on my car, I had no idea what the spots were but one of the employees was able to tell me, which I appreciated, unfortunately he said I would need to get the spots buffed out/detailed and they don't do that at Wash Wizard.   For the price and the customer service I will be coming back for sure. They also use recycled water which is a huge positive!

a large pizza is $5 here, and it was delicious for that price, but of course I've had better tasting pizza that cost way more than that. I'm rating the delivery service; I placed an order via Yelp and it came only 5-10 min past the expected delivery time. I had already pre-paid and tipped though Yelp. The delivery guy came DIRECTLY to my door; I live in a condo complex and no other delivery person has done this while I've lived here so for that alone, 5 stars from me. Food was hot, yummy, cheap and fast. I would definitely recommend for late night deliveries in Tempe.

If you're on a budget and craving sushi, come here. It's not the highest quality, but it will suffice. Fun atmosphere in a large well lit room, I came on Easter Sunday and there were still a good amount of people there. Service was attentive but not overbearing.

I recently came into MomDoc for my annual checkup and to get an IUD. The office itself is decorated nicely, and the staff are usually sitting in the waiting room to check you in; there is no typical check in reception desk.   I had my annual exam with a certified nurse midwife, I cannot remember her name, but she was very nice and got through my exam quickly. They told me I had to wait for my STI test results to come back negative to schedule the IUD appt. I was under a time crunch and needed the IUD placed the next week, and I was able to get an appt for the following Monday.   I had Colleen for my IUD appt. She did a great job in reassuring me, because I was very nervous. Unfortunately, she could not implant the IUD (my cervix was difficult and wouldn't open is what I was told) so she prescribed me meds that would soften the cervix and I scheduled an appt for the next day.   For my second attempt at the IUD, I was with Dr. Rowan. She was also very kind, and luckily, the meds worked great, and she was able to get it implanted quickly and in one try.   The reason I am not rating MomDoc a perfect 5 is because if I had not done meticulous research into the IUD myself, I would have been very misinformed about the product. I was not given very much info about anything when I told the first lady I saw that I wanted an IUD, but I told her I wanted the Mirena and why, so she obviously knew I did my research, so she didn't go into much detail. Same with Colleen and Rowan. My suggestion is to give the patients more information about the product itself, how the procedure and insertion will go, and post care instructions (I had to go find Dr Rowan after the insertion to ask her a few follow up questions)  Other than that, this office was great to deal with (no scheduling/insurance issues) and I will be scheduling future annual exams with them!

Nadjege is now the only person I will go to for waxing services. She is efficient, friendly, and extremely affordable. Her new studio is convenient and comfortable and did I mention she is the best waxer I've ever been to? Give her a call! Or a text, she's very accessible for scheduling appointments. Love her!

Pomo is awesome. Much better value than pizzeria bianco with a larger menu and bar options. I like the atmosphere better here than bianco as well. Our server was attentive and recommended us a fantastic bottle of wine paired with two pizzas we got - and this was at a birthday dinner with 20+ guests at one table. Great experience, I can't wait to go back!

Jason was prompt (arrived early even!), very friendly, and affordable. He was able to get our fridge up and running in a couple of hours. I highly recommend him and will use this company again in the future.
