I have been shopping at the Men's Wearhouse for a little over a year now.  It's been my go to place for business casual clothing that is required at my job.    The staff has always been very friendly and not too pushy, even when they are working on the upsell to get me to buy a couple more ties or shoes.  Being neither Big & Tall or Short & Stout, I appreciate being able to go in find some slacks and get fitted to my exact inseam.  Add to that a guarantee on the tailored items, I will probably continue to go here.

Wow, I will never be coming back here again.  Ordered a crab salad sandwich and then proceeded to wait for 50 minutes.  When my table's food arrived, I had no sandwich. I was not about to wait another 50 minutes for my food so I left.   The table next to me was complaining that they had to wait 20+ minutes to see their server to get their checks to leave.

I actually stumbled upon Chandler Eyecare through a Google search.  I was looking for an eye doctor that was close to where I was living at the time. The entire staff is always friendly and helpful.   I've seen two of the doctors (Van Over and Carpenter) and they are both very pleasant, thorough and informative. A few weeks ago, I had some irritation in my left eye and I was able to get an appointment a couple hours later the same day.

I had heard quite a few good things about this restaurant, specifically the items that they had on the menu.  Showed up with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday.  We had reservations so there was no surprise big group showing up.  Our server was kind of spacy and not really with it.  He did not respond to our questions about items on the menu and when he did he mumbled.  Now normally I wouldn't care about this but add the rest of his service and this made for an annoying time.  When we were done eating we asked for our checks.  Thirty minutes later he finally came with our checks; where we proceeded to promptly provide form of payment.  Then we waited....10 minutes, 20 minutes.  We were being held captive since Malee's had our cards.  When he came to us again he had some of the receipts for us to sign, but not all.  They signed and he came back and said he needed all of our cards again.  After waiting for over an hour just to close our tab out and leave, I complained to the manager and he simply brushed aside my concern. It should never take over an hour just to get your bill, pay and leave.  If the food wasn't so good, this review would have been a 1-star.

I will probably return to Bison Witches ONLY because of the quality of the food, however the service that we received was pretty bad.  When we walked in we were advised by one of the servers to sit anywhere. We selected a booth right by the bar and waited.....and waited...and waited.  We figured out after about 15 minutes that the guy fiddling with quarters and dollar bills and staring off into space at the bar was our server.  Finally he came over and asked for our drinks.  At this time, we had already had sufficient time to order our food as well but he cut us off and said he could only take our drink order.  He returned several minutes later and we ordered our sandwiches and chili.    Now I do want to point out that the food arrived very quickly and was quite good, especially the chili bowl!  When we were finished, he eventually brought our bill to which we promptly added our cards to pay for lunch.  Then we began the waiting game again while he stood up at the bar doing NOTHING.  After losing our patience because his lack of attention was going to make my co-worker and I late for work we had to ask another server to run the cards for us.  He was not a very good server to have representing your business and is the reason for the 2 star rating.

I like this particular location because the tellers are always very pleasant and quick.  I rarely go into banks since I prefer to deal with direct deposit and electronic transfer.  However, there is the occasion where I get a check from somewhere and need to deposit it.  It also gives me a chance to ditch work for a little bit; just don't tell my manager!  The big bonus for me is that when there is a line waiting for the regular tellers, they have the person at the front desk take your deposit if you don't need any cash.

I've been enjoying doing my grocery shopping here because they are in the final stages of remodeling the location and making it much more appealing to be in and not worry about catching something due to how dirty it had been. I'm also a fan of how much natural & organic food choices they've brought in as well

There are clearly a lot of mixed to negative reviews of Grigio Tempe Town Lake.  While I agree with some of the various factors that cause the lower rating, I feel overall for me that this is a great place to live.   1. Staff - I moved in November of 2011 and since then I have dealt with 2 different management companies.  The current staff seemed distant at first but then again they were thrust into the job without any notice at all.   Since then, they've been helpful and friendly without having any issues.  2.  As another reviewer mentioned there does seem to be some shady behavior over the availability of the Sky Lounge on the 4th of July.  I've heard from several other residents that it was management involved in this "drama".  If off base, I'd love to hear from management about this.  It was not reserved so there should have been no issue for residents and guests to go up to view the fireworks on Mill.  It certainly appeared that the cop had no business being there since after he was questioned as to why residents were not allowed he left, rather grumpily. The Sky Lounge is an amenity to the Grigio lifestyle (the high rent allows me to consider it one).  3.  The rent is higher than you can find at other apartments in the Tempe area, however high speed internet and DirecTV with HBO is included in the rent so to me that justifies some of the higher cost.  Other amenities included are affordable housekeeping services and convenient dry cleaning drop off/pickup.  4. Security does seem to be doing their job right now as I have not been disturbed too much at 3am when drunk kids are heading home from a night out.  I haven't seen much of them so I'm not sure what their presence is.  5. Grigio is located in a great spot for those of us that happen to work/play on Mill Ave. It is also a reasonable cab fare from the bars and clubs in Old Town.  Having  lived in Gilbert prior this is a VERY big plus for me.  6. As you can see I'm trying to sandwich the negative aspects of Grigio in between the good ones.  The parking garage can be rather treacherous as there are some of the residents who love to drive in the dark garage without headlights and at unreasonable speeds.  Oh and by the way, you do realize that it's a two way garage so you're going to have to move your damn car to the right or you're going to hit me!! The repair of the speed bumps has improved things slightly as the cars are going somewhat slower now.  7.  From all of the complaints I've read about the neighbors, I have to consider myself extremely fortunate.  My immediate neighbors are quiet and friendly so I've never had to worry about extremely loud parties going on all hours. Sure it can get loud some nights but I've only really ever noticed it Thursday-Saturday nights and I'm usually a late night dweller on two of those nights so it's a moot point.  8.  Being a single guy I opted for the studio apartment.  No normally when I think of studio I think of a boring box of a place.  With mine it does not have the traditional straight lines but a lot of angles that give the impression of a much larger space and it creates separation from the different areas(living room, office area, kitchen and bedroom).  I love it!  9.  I've had a couple of maintenance issues where I've had to open work orders.  The work has always been done in a timely manner and I've never had to have work redone.  To give you an idea of the type of work orders: running toilet, bath tub had to be refinished, shower head replaced, AC broke down (repaired within 2 hours).  10.  Last but not least I have to mention the gym.  It has several treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes for cardio on one level.  On the lower level you have dumbbells, weight machines, cable machines.  One of the other perks is the opportunity to pay for personal training services from a fitness company called Epic Fitness.  If paying for training is not your thing, you can do a boocamp every couple of weeks for free since you're a resident.  Overall, there are some negative things but you've got to understand what you're getting.  Convenient location to ASU, Mill Ave, Old Town and the light rail.  With the convenient location, it creates an optimal place for the younger crowd who will typically have a more active lifestyle of going out and staying up late.

I had been in meetings all day so having a healthy lunch went out the door due to the intense hunger pangs.  I decided I'd might as well go big or go home and just get a whopper slathered in mayo and ketchup. Figured it would be quick since there was one person in front of me and no one in the parking lot dining in....WRONG.  After 22 minutes, I finally pulled up to the window to give the person my debit card.  I waited some more and finally got my meal 10 minutes later.  Only saving grace was the whopper and fries were piping hot; however it should not have taken over half an hour.  This is not what I call "fast" food.

I've been coming to this place for quite awhile because of the Philly Whiz.  There is something about rib eye steak grilled up with onions and cheese whiz!!  Only downside is if you want the value meal with the regular sized sandwich you are going to pay $10+.

The Tempe Marketplace Cine Capri is supposed to be a rendition of the historical one opened in the 1960's.  I've enjoyed the movies I've watched in the specific screen designated as Cine Capri.  It is a spacious screen with a lot of seating.  All of the seats are not necessarily a bad view; although I have not been seated in the very front rows, otherwise that opinion might change!  The concessions here move surprisingly quick.  There have been times when I get into the queue with a ton of people and have my food/beverages within 5 minutes and then off to the show.  Some of the men's restrooms could have better working towel dispensers because I always have intermittent success with them.

This location in Mesa Riverview is one of the smaller ones that I've been in before to get my hair cut.  That said, I have gotten the most consistent haircut from all of the stylists (4 to date).    For me that is something to be said since I enjoy having some stability in how my hair is going to look every 3-4 weeks.  I like wearing a baseball hat but not because I'm embarrassed to have my hair be seen.  With the ability to check in online or via their mobile app, there is no longer any waiting in the cramped waiting area; of which there are only 8 seats I believe.  With the checking in option, I can wait at home or run other errands before showing up and getting my hair cut as soon as I walk in.

This is one of those hole in the wall spots in an industrial park setting.  Basically you may not even know they are there until a friend or coworker tells you about it.  I'm glad that they did! Aside from being in a nondescript location they have tremendous sandwich options!  For my first foray into their offerings I went with the Sparky, a mouth watering sandwich with turkey, bacon and avocado.  Since I'd gotten the sandwich in the Shorty Combo I was able to get some macaroni salad as a side.   If you don't like a heavy mayo taste in your macaroni salad I would advise against it as a side.  The potato salad or chips make an equally appetizing side.  If you're going there for lunch be sure to go early or later than 12 since the seating is limited inside of AZ Sandwich Co.  I will definitely go again!

I just had the most phenomenal pizza here. It was like potato skins on a pizza.  Figured I would be brave and try something crazy off the menu and it was delicious.  We were seated right away and had our drinks within less than 5 minutes being seated.  Very good service as well.  Too bad I was on the clock or I would have sampled some of their very large beer selection!!!

This place has apparently been open for about 2-3 weeks.  I headed here with some co-workers for a late Friday "meeting".  Otherwise known as happy hour!  They have a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  I had a New Belgium Super IPA that they had on draft and one of their sausages(Chicken and Apple) topped with some sauerkraut and mustard.  It was quite a good combination and was recommended by our server.  If you're looking for food, then you may be disappointed in the small amount of options, however, when you realize that their kitchen is the size of a small closet, it kind of makes sense.   With the cooler weather right on the horizon here in the valley, their very large patio area should come in quite handy.  I will definitely try them out again.

2 miles away from home and on the way to work.  What better place to pick up some fruit and a post workout protein shake?!  Ah who am I kidding? It's usually for a donut and coffee since I'm too lazy to make coffee at home.  Plus I'm in and out in less than 5 minutes and on my way to work.

Met up with a friend for lunch here since we both like to try out different restaurants around the Valley. At first impression, you have a fairly nondescript building and a very narrow driveway to the parking in the back.  Do not let that deter you because inside you will find a menu with some pretty phenomenal and high quality food!  To start off, we had hot & sour soup and the egg flower soup.  The carrots and peas in my egg flower soup were so fresh.  For the main entree, I had a Sichuan dish of twice fried pork with various grilled vegetables served with rice.  My lunch partner opted for a vegetarian dish of mushrooms; which I admittedly stole from when she wasn't looking!! It was pretty damn good.  Our server was very helpful in identifying what was in the various dishes and the food was promptly delivered.  I definitely recommend you try this place if you want some authentic Sichuan and/or Cantonese style cuisine.  To recap, this is definitely a place that you want to try

I have to say that I'm thoroughly impressed with the service and quality of the food here.  Having just opened up here in Tempe, I assumed that when my co-workers and I decided to go here for lunch that we would encounter issues:  - No Parking - Massive Lines - Waiting forever for food that would be cold by the time we got it  I was rewarded for my pessimism with parking attendants who directed us right to a parking spot.  The line was long but we all had our food in less than 10 minutes.  The staff was smiling and very helpful.  The food....It was awesome.  I got the Italian Beef with hot peppers and it was phenomenal!  I'm pretty sure I inhaled it without chewing enough it was that good.  Contemplated getting another sandwich but then thought the better of it.   I will definitely be coming back, but it will be difficult to try the other menu items since the Italian Beef was so good
