Gross  I think the meats are boiled and not smoked.   Everything was loose and chewy and over cooked to a mush.   Don't eat here. It's living off hype.

Picked up my dry cleaning and there was a baggy attached containing $55 and a credit card I had left in my pant pocket !  Love this place.

Because I was running late I left work without eating lunch.  Yelp on my iPhone pointed out Haps as being an excellent place to eat on my way to I-17.  Food is awesome.  Everything I had, (sampler) ranging from smoked chicken, ribs, pulled pork and brisket was really, really awesome.  And not that I'm into it but the sampler plate (to go) must have weighed 5 pounds.  No way I could finish.  One of those little hidden gems that you have to go find.  HIghly recommend and will gladly go back again.

For starters I should say that I travel all around the US and make an effort to eat Thai food in every city I visit and Siam Orchid is by far the best, best, best Thai restaurant I've been too.  It's not glam or glitz, it's more like if you had a Thai aunt that could run into the kitchen and cook you up some that tastes amazing.  The staff (a family owned business) is incredibly friendly and personable.  I've never seen more customers come in and get hugs.  Ask a couple of questions about Thailand and you'll be the next hug recipient when you come in.  The food, off the charts good.  It isn't often that you take a bite of something and wonder how they manage to make it taste so good.  Recipes, as described above, are a family secret that the owner Pimpom isn't sharing with anyone.  So if you're in the greater Phoenix area and looking for a Thai place I would recommend that you look no further, pop in and give Siam Orchid a try and you won't be disappointed.  Lastly, the review below is a shockingly different story from any experience I have had .. and I've eaten there more than 50 times.

It's hard to be a Debby Downer because after all, it's a puppet show for kids. Having said that there's something about the shows that falls flat, almost like they are adults without kids who are trying to relate to kids. For example, the first 20 minutes of all the shows is all about the "rules" which involves keeping your kids in check. I get it, but they're kids, they're going to blurt things out and jump up and down.   Ive seen 3 shows now amd the best one is the 3 little pigs which includes some audience participation. Up until then it's been kids watching a show and encouraged to be quiet.  Refreshingly, the wolf puppeteer seems to be more experienced, he engages the kids and annunciates so you can hear him clearly unlike the squeaky Puppet Director that uses the same voice for every character.   Maybe it's me but her range is totally annoying and actually distracts, especially when she's constantly humming while other characters are talking,   Room for improvement: Better writing. It currently reminds me of bad improv. Some scenes are totally awkward leaving the kids and parents totally quiet when the curtains close.   I'd like to say better audio but the equipment I'm sitting near is actually pretty good but most people (aside from the wolf) seem muffled or distant and as mentioned lady's voice is hard on the ears.   Continue working with the kids and not fighting them. The more audience participation the better.  The kids were loving it when the wolf asked them which way the pig went.   Maybe some pre recorded background announcements with different voices?  There's like 6 to 8 individual characters in a show, all sharing 2 voices.   I appreciate their efforts and would love to see it be way more kid friendly and entertaining so I wouldn't have to burn in hell for bashing a children's puppet show done on a shoestring budget  If you are thinking of going, give it a shot, maybe I'm wrong. .

In a word, pathetic.   I can only comment on the brunch they presented on Sunday.  Took a relative visiting from New England that wanted to eat at a Beau MacMilan restaurant and boy was it disappointing. Here's the low lights:  1. Menu. You can pay a lot of money for the brunch or a lot more money on top of brunch to have an entre. No option available just to order an entre. Already strange.   2. Selection. Seems like whatever was left in the kitchen over the weekend turns into brunch. Maybe Kitchen Confidential  was right. Rice and miso soup in the left corner with a small bowl of hummus (no pita) in the right corner. Omelettes on the west side, Greek orzo on the east side.  If you are suffering from an identity crisis, you may as well serve up some classics (roast beef or ham with eggs) and take the hit that you are boring.   3. Service. Abysmal. Our smarmy French server Daniel had an excuse for everything that he failed to deliver. After 10 minutes of waiting for soy sauce for the white rice I walked into the kitchen myself and within 20 seconds came back with soy sauce. Just a thought but when you take a plate with utensils it would be wise to replace them.  I can steal them from the next table over myself (which is what he did). Unlimited sparkling wine comes with the buffet, if you could get a refill. Eventually we tasked one of   the more helpful bussing staff to fill in where the server failed, which was at nearly every task and its a buffet !   4. Management. At one time, the  manager made a stroll through the dining hall but never stopped at a single table to ask how things are going,  Probably because he already knew. His major accomplishment was getting more Coronas from downstairs.   5. Bill. Kids under 7 eat free until the bill shows up. Now I've got to go track down the non existent server to dispute the bill.  In the end, someone spent millions of dollars to build a beautiful restaurant on the side of Camelback Mountain, only to fill it with unqualified staff to create sour memories for eager out of towers, but at least it's expensive.   Highlights, the table bussing staff and valet. Both very nice and hard working.

Its official, Biancos has "jumped the shark".  We used to eat at his place when he was in a strip mall on Camelback and watched his business "grow" to what it is now.   I jokingly say "grow" because he probably has less tables now than he did before.  The only difference is that he didnt have a wine bar to send his customers to wait for 2 hours.  If you've been to Biancos then you already know the game but for those who dont, here goes:  1. You won't get in unless you stand outside for about 90 minutes before they open.  (Please)  2. If you get there when they open, you'll be waiting for 2 hours. (Please)  3. To make your 2 hour wait better he has a wine bar, which miraculously accommodates all the people he cant seat, where you will probably spend over $100 in booze as you wait.  Sort of like the beverage equivalent of the slot machines in the Vegas airport.  4. When you jump through all those hurdles, you'll get some awesome food.  You'll also notice that he only has a few tables which is why the wait is so long.  I can appreciate the fact that he wants to maintin the quality of his food, resulting in limited production but is it "all that"?  For outside visitors with time on their hands it's probably worth it to go once and check the box.  For locals like me, go somewhere else.  For smart locals, start another, larger pizza place across the street;

Cute place with a nice vibe but littered with want-to-be homeless pretenticons.  Lots of seats open but this troll is using it for his laptop bag or ratty jacket. Kind of like a small version of the Seattle airport terminal. Hey, he's paid his $1.75 for an Italian soda, he got a right to loaf across the sofa for a couple if hours to read Kafka. I'll give them credit for not going to Starbucks but they probably tried and the furniture was too hard.  If it were in a real city it would be regular, because it's near this lifeless cluster of buildings called "downtown" it appears to be avant-garde.    Great music and great coffee.  Clientelle, not so much. Will try again to compare notes.

I should preface this review by saying that for the past decade, it has been very hard to find consistently good NY style pizza in Arizona.  For whatever reason the Chicago transplants started up restaurants to support their own but the New Yorkers were late to the game.  So having Grimaldis show up is a breath of fresh air and if I wasn't for that I'd give it 4 starts instead of 5. Because it's a chain.  If you are in AZ and want good brick oven NY style pizza then this is hands down the place to go to.  They only serve salad, calzones and pizza so don't come here for a romantic date.  On the flip side, it's not a dumpy hole in the wall it's a nice looking place with a modest decor and as a previous reviewer commented, they even serve Robert Mondavi for  us stuck up Scottsdale residents.  I have probably been there 20 times and each time the staff has been friendly, the service has been good and the food has been excellent.

Used to come here a lot and always found the food to be good but the service to be horrible.  Lo and behold, they listened to the complaints and really upped the service to beyond good, it's actually amazing.    Great food, great service.  Didn't give it 5 stars because it's expensive.

For starters, I love Pita Jungle and although the food here is top notch the service is annoyingly bad.   The past two times the servers have disappeared to that magical vortex called "server land".  Where on Earth do they disappear to ?   I'm not sure how there can be 5 people in the restaurant and the server(s) can't seem to handle it. At times there are servers walking around, literally right past your table, ignoring the fact that you've even sitting there for 10 minutes with a menu and they don't stop and ask if you need anything due to some strange server boundary rules.    "Have you been helped yet?" Seems to be a common theme in this location.    Long winded way of saying food 10, service 0.

Worst business I've ever dealt with. My refrigerator was broken and after three months of dealing with them they still don't have it fixed.   Incompetent scammers that will call you a "f$cking asshole" and threaten to "beat your ass" when you tell them that you'll have to take legal action unless they fix the problem they promised to fix.   Do not use at all costs.

How this place gets any more than one star is beyond me.   The first concern is the appetizers (falafel, hummus, baba ghanousj) are the furthest thing from Ethiopian.  If I wanted Middle Eastern food I would go to Pita Jungle.   The main courses are like "pseudo-Ethiopian".  The meal descriptions are like written in a way you'd trick a child into eating something a little weird.  And no "doro wat" on the menu !  That's like a Thai restaurant not having "Pad Thai". The main dish Americans eat.   The food. Bland and boring.   Don't bother going.

Last three times my family and I have come to Vegas, we've stayed at the Trump and it's been great. This time it's been a joke for the following reasons:  1. Checked in at 4 and they said my room wasn't ready but they would upgrade me to a corner suite, it will be inspected in 20 minutes and they will call me.  After roaming around Vegas for TWO HOURS, no call.  I return to the hotel to inquire and they tell me the room hasn't been cleaned yet.. Then they offer me my old room back.   2. Nothing works here. Remote controls, in room telephones, everything is broken.  3. Valet.  When you take a taxi from the MGM to the Trump the fare is about $11 which goes to $15 because you end up sitting there waiting in a cab for 10 minutes for the valets to clear the driveway.    4. It's filthy. Rooms are starting to look worn out, carpets are stained.   5. Clientele.  Trump seems to be a haven for groups of thugs that, because the rooms are large, can pile 5 to 8 people in a single suite and have room parties with cases of beer and coolers.  Major shame, used to love staying here but I'll be finding a new place to stay.

Ok this is hard for me beause the food is 6 stars.  I take my friends, family, clients here and everybody raves about it ..... but.  The smart ass kids at the counter have got to go.  I don't know their names but  one in particular should retire and become a lawyer because when you ask if you can have your sandwich on Italian (roll) instead of focaccia he says "Focaccia is Italian" and then looks at you smugly.  I took the high road and neglected to point out to him that a baguette he offered was French.  He should  pay less attention to geography and work on his note taking skills because after all that, the sandwich still came on a focaccia.  So I hope the owner hears this, your front line of sales at the counter makes me want to go somewhere else.  Your six star food, averaged with your zero star staff puts you at a 3.  And yes Guiseppe, I want to drink diet coke and I don't need a lecture on how it has "echemica that is a bad for your brain". If you feel so strongly about it, then don't sell it !  I'm sure your meats contribute to heart disease but you're not grimacing when I order a porchetta sandwich (which is unbelievably good by the way)  So Andreloi, please get someone up front with a smile and who, at a minimum, has read a pamphlet on the basics of customer service.  Hate having to write this one.

In a nutshell ... boring.  For some reason my friends like to come to this place and I've been several times so this review is actually a culmination of all my experiences.  For starters, ever time I come here they only have one server.  I'd like to say the service is terrible but that wouldnt be fair because there's only one person handling the whole restaurant.  The real key here is that the management/owners (whatever) don't ever get up off their asses and help out when the poor girl is swamped. Look around, you'll see lots of parched people sitting in front of empty glasses.  And speaking of management, don't think about bringing a kid here unless you're interested in dirty looks from the old hostess.  Believe me I hate kids in restaurants too but it's 6:00pm and if it wasn't for my friend and his kids eating these mediocre $20 pizzas the place would be dead so sweetheart, yes, you with the grimace, lighten up.  You're bringing the whole dining experience down.  And speaking of down.  I've seen several, several, several kids spill full cups of milk on the floor in this place because the owners refuse to stock plastic cups with lids and straws for the kids. You can find stupid metallic covers for your goofy menus but can't stock a lid. Talk about being obstinant.  OK, on to the food.  Not bad, not great.  Not quite convinced it's Tuscan but if you're lost in North Scottsdale and can't find Grimaldis and you stumble into this place you'll walk away with a mediocre Italian meal.

Bad news SR has been hit with the ghostly, unsolvable "sulfur / egg / sewer / hair salon" stink that attacks all Scottsdale businesses that don't complain to the city. I swear there's a valve the city opens and closes to push the odor to the next business when the previous one complains.  I've smelled it from Frank Lloyd Wright to Shea.   Make no mistake about it, when you walk in it smells putrid.   Service - Older lady working all alone that can only do one thing at a time complaining about how her arm is going to get a good workout today. Slow to say the least and theres hardly anyone in here.   Ice Cream - Delicious, original, something that sort of makes the comments above worth it.    Please, remove that funky air you got up in there.

Pathetic, especially when the concierge says its "one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in the nation".    The food, even if at half the price, would be considered uninspiring.  The service was just as bad .. but at least it was expensive.  $100 for three bad meals.  Do not eat here, it's worse than bad, it's boring and expensive.  You can pay the same amount and eat at Nobu and have a much better experience.

This place is a con-job rip off !! Beware !  Beware Beware !  Scary enough all i would have to do is reference the prior review about the woman with the train cake. Our experiences were identical as was the response of the company.  We had a birthday party planned for our son, coordinated the cake for weeks.  I had a graphics person make a great image to print on the cake and sent it in. The owner Liz (who talks a good game on the phone) takes my order, tells me how great its going to be, coordinates the delivery weeks in advance and then shows up to the party late with 100% the wrong cake!  The bad part here is not like someone else's cake, she just printed something totally different and basically tells you to take it or send it back leaving your kid (and their 30 friends) without any cake.  I've seen mobsters in New Jersey operate with more ethics.  So here we go, another botched party due to a lazy, incompetent, ignorant woman who thinks she knows how to run a business but can't. Now I have to call my credit card company to dispute the entire order.  Trust me, let the internet do the work for you, RUN FOR THE HILLS.  Go to Costco, at least you'll get what you ask for.  I wouldn't buy a cake for my worst enemy at this place.

My friend and I stumbled into Red Bird as we reluctantly joined a group of co-workers to our local "Bertos" taco shop.  I guess my initial short review is that his place has "substance over form".    The lady behind the counter was extremely nice and she convinced us that they had the best burger in town.  For background, we've seen four different Burger joints come to our neighborhood, claim they had the best burger in town, only to pack up and move on 8 months later.  One of them was run by an Indian guy; I thought cows were sacred!  Anyway, we took her up on the challenge and ordered the burgers and I have say, in the immortal words of Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield)   "that IS a tasty burger".  Good quality meat, nice bread and the amazing part .. fresh condiments.  Anyone in AZ knows that tomatoes suck here but for some reason my slice was excellent, a rare treat in this arid environment.  Also, the fries were really well done.  So as our buddies at "Bertos" strolled over and saw how good our food was we agreed to come back soon because the best feature about this place (in my opinion) is that they'll serve you anything on the breakfast menu .. for lunch.  So if you want a nice, clean, unassuming place to get a quick, relatively inexpensive breakfast or lunch, this is your place.

I travel extensively and have eaten Thai food in restaurants all over the planet so I know how good or bad thai food can be.   Having said that, I don't agree with some of the mediocre reviews on the site, the food here is excellent. The dishes are always delicately prepared and the produce is always crispy fresh and extremely flavorful.   The staff is excellent and very accommodating towards special requests and the atmosphere is unique in the sense that its progressive with live contemporary music (not your stereotypical Thai "atmosphere" tapes playing)  To put it in perspective I eat here at least once or twice a week and there are many other Thai restaurants to choose from.   If you're teetering, give it a shot I think you'll find it to be excellent.

Just to clarify the other posts. The guy that ran Thai Pan (Thai Basil predecessor) pretty much catered to the typical scared American that wouldn't want to order from a Thai only menu.  For example, on top of his Thai selections he had dishes like "Tai-Yaki" which was just chicken teriyaki dressed up and an "Atkins" section.   Under new ownership those things are gone.  The staff, like the menu, appears to be all Thai. They all certainly speak Thai and a lot of the basic Thai accessories are there. Because of the name change, I ate there for the first time and the food was actually pretty good, service was decent and the staff was extremely pleasant.   I'll definitely be going back to try some more dishes but won't be ordering sushi.

Don't believe the hype.  Fad food.   Service is abysmal. Club kids comparing notes about the prior night on the town and a sushi chef comparing different rolls to the size of his, and his coworkers penis. His co worker is the shorter but fatter roll in case you were interested.  I'd rather just have a server that pays attention.    Food is a cool idea of fusing Mexican and Asian but the execution falls way short and diminishes the concept. Why put two great things together if they outcome is going to be sub-par?  Kind of what like Martin Sheen would say.     Had a bagel with lox fusion concept that was just a straight up mess on the plate. Somehow it remained boring even though It was complicated and overdone.  In the end it's a gimmick and doesn't have legs. Scottsdale people will think it's awesome for about another year and they'll come up with a new fad for you.   I say go somewhere else.

Feeling a little deceived by the high ratings.  Duck wings were chewy beyond belief. Order of four, hardly ate one.   Steak was cooked via sous vide which would be nice if it wasn't so bland.  Grilled onions are supposed to compliment the flavor, not lead.   Fried chicken was so-so but not inspiring by any means.   Conclusion : I'd definitely go back for drinks but would not eat here again until the food improves.

Rip off alert. They claim to have big name stars perform but it's a con job.  Tickets say that Joe Nichols starts @ 5. Internet then says 7. By 11 the cover band they have "opening" can't stall any more  I left after 5 hours and never saw Joe Nichols.
