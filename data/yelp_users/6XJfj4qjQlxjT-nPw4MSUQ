Don't let this place fool you. To keep the story short the server, Erica, said there was no merlot. Okay. Ordered a couple Malbecs ($8 each) instead. When we got the bill she charged the order as both Merlots ($10 each).  She never told us she had it on stock. It was more like...surprise! Let's charge them more bc either the server is thinking a) I don't know what they ordered or b) I'm gonna charge more so I can get a bigger tip. For that we gave her $3 for lying to us!! Btw def didn't taste like a merlot.  Checked my credit card charges for 2 separate receipts few days later. The server gave herself more than 20% tip when I clearly put zero on one and $3 on another receipt for 3 drinks -- purposely!!! She doesn't deserve it!   Called the manager a few days later and short story was the manager, Adam was trying to sound professional but totally sounded annoyed. Yes it's only a few dollars but the whole principle behind their service was shady to say the least. Adam said he would call back a couple days later. Nope!! One week went by and no one called me back. So guess what? I called back. Spoke with another manager, Francisco. He told me that Adam said it was an INCONVENIENCE for him to reverse the charges and that it will cost them!!!! Hahahahahaha really??!!?? You have to be kidding me! What kind of service is this!?? They're worried about a few dollars rather than their reputation??? Wow!! That really says a lot about them. He told me the only way to get credit back is to come back for a free drink. How about NO!! Why would I go back to a place that is shady? Anyway he said Adam will call me back. We will see about that. Maybe they will when they see this.   Also I agree with the other reviews from Rick and Rich. Going cheap on the Moscow mule by serving it in a smaller glass. Classic.

This is one of three locations to enjoy bruchettas, pressed panini, and salads. I like to order the half salad and half sandwich. Italian picnic and raspberry chicken salads are my favorites. Chicken & mozzarella and the nine iron panini are my 2 faves.  You can't go wrong with any of the Bruschetta choices such as warm artichoke spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. Come early to beat the rush hour of happy hour or you will be forced to wait a while. Come here on Monday and Tuesdays to enjoy the $20 bruchetta board and a bottle of wine! All locations have valet parking.

A place for lunch pick up for the team if you're looking for authentic mexican food. They are known for the Goliath-size tortillas. I've had the chicken enchiladas and the beef chimichanga with sour cream and guacamole. If you're in the need for for some greasiness then this is the place for you. It's all goooodddd!! Yum! ;)

This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants. Can't go wrong with the beef bulgogli, spicy BBQ chicken, spicy BBQ pork, kalbi (short ribs), chap chae (clear noodles appetizer with red and green bell peppers, onions, and bits of bulgogi beef), kimchi tofu soup. Expect 6 little banchan side dishes. The BBQ dishes are just under $20 - which comes with rice. Chap chae is about $14 and plenty for an appetizer.

Found another hidden pocket of goodness- to make you sleep within 7 minutes of finishing your meal!! No kidding! If you're having problems sleeping at night make sure to check this place out for dinner! ;) Your taste buds will enjoy the food and your brain will enjoy its "powers" to put you to sleep (like a food coma). But really- the dishes were delectable.   This is in the NE corner if 101-N and Broadway. With the outside sign a bit tattered, this little market still boasts a dining experience to talk about. Staff immediately greeted and asked whether it was dining in or ordering to go and chose to dine in. To the right there were several tables and booths to choose from. Immediately was given menus and asked if ready to order. Waitress was attentive. Chicken shawarma sandwich was around $4 and the kabob combo (kabobs of chicken, beef, and lamb) with rice, salad, hummus and warm pita was about $12. When asking the waitress what kinds if meat was in the combo she said she doesn't know- and just works there. That was odd because I would have thought that if she wasn't knowledgable about what was on the plate that she could have at least asked the other staff. A skilled worker should at least be knowledgable about those basic popular dishes. Maybe in time. Minus that part everything was exceptional. Baklava was super sweet and delicious. Ended up buying a few more baklava to go! Once you're done just check out with the pleasant cashier at the front, and off to get some powerful coffee or to that comfy bed awaiting. ;)

The best Vietnamese food on the east side! My fave dishes in no particular order are: Appetizers: -Pork egg rolls not like Chinese egg rolls but 10 times better! Comes in 2 with the romaine lettuce and mint leaves to wrap it all up ready to dip in that pungent yet flavorful saltiness fish sauce -nig mum sauce.  -Vietnamese shrimp & veggie rolls made of shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint leaves, cilantro and sprouts. This is dipped in the peanut hoisin sauce. Yummy!   Rice dish: - charbroiled beef and shrimp with egg cake over rice dish. The beef is marinated really well and tenderized to anyone's liking. Comes with their pickled shreds and slices of cabbage, cucumber and carrots. Again, the nig mum sauce to pour all over the dish.  -charbroiled curry chicken and lemongrass over rice. Strong flavors make this dish tasty! -house special fried rice was an all around great staple for those that are afraid to try anything new. Mix in a bit of Siracha sauce for a little kick.   Pho (soup) -Saigon beef rice noodle soup aka pho. An assortment of beef and its counterparts. Such a nice comfort soup especially on a rainy day!  4 stars because the decor has been the same for at least a decade. But the food is definitely a 5 star in my book.

I've come to this location many times for lunch, dinner happy hour and reverse happy hour. I believe you will be able to find something good to eat here. They have a nice patio out in the back and plenty of tables inside. Weekends they have live bands come in to entertain the crowd. "Do I not entertain you??" Just kidding.... No Braveheart here but had to throw that in there!!   Anyway, my favorites:  Starters: grilled chicken and hummus. You can have this to dine in or as a good to go order. And you can even have this as an entree because it is that good. You'll have the regular hummus with an olive and a couple cucumber circles.   Featured Specials: Mahi Mahi entree. "Instead of the Mahi Mahi can I just have one Mahi?" Sound familiar? Comes on a bed pea sprouts greens, 4 small crunchy paprika looking sprinkled pita chips, and a nice creamy green sauce. Spritz it with lemon. Delicious!   Healthy Burger: chipotle black bean burger. House made black bean burger (made with corn, cranberries, garlic, onion, carrots, oats, variety of peppers) with onions, tomato, pea sprouts, and a side of garlic potato.   Happy Hour: drafts are a couple dollars. White or red Sangria $3. Margaritas, mimosas, martini, cocktails are also on special. Tapas style starters such as falafel, grilled lemon chicken, mussels, hummus and pita are $3 and under. $5.99 for the mix of 3 of the following: chicken slider, beef slider, chicken paco or ribeye paco (pita transformed as the taco shell). Otherwise they are $2.50 each. Happy is from 3-6pm or 9pm to close.   A place to eat, enjoy, and entertain. See you there!

Great happy service from the cashier guy. Very friendly and knows how to talk to his customers about anything like other coffee shops! Ordered an afternoon green tea latte and a chocolate croissant for an afternoon snack.

Argh!!  Dear Apple,  I've been to your store a good handful and a half or so for several issues over the past 3 months. As of tonight I just got my phone replaced (for the 3rd time). Yay! This time it was for the touch screen not working for periods of 20 minutes or so. However, as soon as I got home it already has another issue. Now, there is a rattling noise every time I get a text when the sound is on- whereas it didn't do that before! Argh! I foresee another hour wasted for my phone issue. "Why me??"  Every time I came in for my appointment whether it's 20 minutes early, on time or 5 minutes late, I have always had to waste time waiting for at least 30 minutes!!! That is not the way to handle customer service. It's a downer in my books. Suggestion: Why not text back using technology (and like restaurants) of when a technician is ready??? (Assuming phone is somewhat working).   Anyway, after the wait tonight the technician was kind and handled the replacement of my phone well. And he followed through with the iCloud backup. We have yet to see if the touch screen does not react. (Fingers crossed that I don't have that issue going forward). Now it's the noise rattling. :( Let's wait a week to see what else happens.   Help...Please fix my phone for the final time.   Sincerely, Me

Feeling like breakfast for a late lunch? Here's a good place to eat for breakfast and/or lunch. Egg whites and veggies omelette with potatoes and English muffin is great ($9). The short stack (2) chocolate banana buttermilk pancakes for $9.50 was more than enough for one person. It was literally the size of the plate - bigger than my face. At first I didn't think it was going to be good because it looked a little bit burnt but it actually tasted really good! And then endless coffee was $2.50. Overall good food and good service.

Wow!! The WORST service ever. I rarely go to this store bc it's primarily for teens but $25 jeans sounds like a steal!! Why not check it out.  I got to the cashier counter and saw 3 teen workers. One girl assisting  a customer, one on the cash register "typing away" and one guy also on cash register and putting away the security pieces.  Stood there looking at each one. None of them seem to be acknowledging that customers are waiting to check out.  Do any of the workers even know how to open their mouth and say something like "thanks for patiently waiting. someone will be with you in a moment"?? They all must be oblivious to what working means.  The one girl that was "typing away" doing who knows what was in the middle and left. Leaving the guy and the girl who was done with the customer. As soon as she was done she was asking another worker to help her get to the top of the stacked surf boards because her co-worker put it at the top. Um hello!! Do you not see a customer with a stack of pants to purchase???  The one guy was waiting for a customer to come back with more items while the other girl was somewhat apologetic thinking that the guy was helping me. Clearly not the case. As soon as she got her phone back she was all about what text messages she got and giggling to herself instead of adding to the bottom dollar for the company.  All those teen workers must be working for free or interning for free because they clearly are not doing work. Can't expect too much from teens - so who knows. Anyone have teens that want to get paid to do almost nothing can pretty much apply to this store!!  Sadly, I bought about $120 worth of bottoms. I thought about it and for all this, I decided to return $100 worth back to Hollister a few days later - keeping one yoga pants. The jeans weren't that flattering after all. No wonder it was $25. Thanks but no thanks.

I came here for my cousins wedding and loved the ambience. The wedding view was towards the golf greens on a beautiful day- minus pool area lined off with bushes. An older couple (with the husband's  disturbing belly view of a shirt-off attire -- should have been a younger cut version view ) were enjoying the ceremony too while hotel guests watch from atop their balconies.   Cocktail hour was outside the Arizona room and reception in the Arizona room. If you are wanting to arrive straight to the Arizona room it's best to go there from the outside in. The inside path was a confusing maze - maybe fun for hide and seek.   Enjoyed a poached pear salad with mixed greens, crumbled feta cheese and candied walnuts, and a crusted trout with asparagus,  baby carrot on a small mound of mashed potatoes and a type of béarnaise sauce.

It has been a long long time since I have been here. I'm glad I made it to a dinner here to remind me of the goodness tastes of the platter!!   For a table of 10, we were seated in the upstairs area- which is common for a large group. Reservations can be made through OpenTable or calling in. A bar sits at the top along with a couple more large groups and small 2-4 off table seatings.   Appetizer: Persian Room Appetizer Platter to share with the table. Combination of dolmeh (stuffed veggies in a grape leaf) , hummus & eggplant, yogurt & cucumber dip, and torshi (pickled veggies) a fun shareable platter. $15.95  Combination Platter: I shared the Chefs special platter (serves 2) but really could be made for 3-4 depending on your appetite. This includes the chicken filet, chicken kubideh, fish kebob (mahi mahi) sabzy polo ("dirty rice"- sprinkled with some cooked scallions and dill) and basmati rice. We subbed the chicken kubideh with beef kubideh. Both rice were large mounds of rice sitting on half the platter. Other half of he platter were aligned with a row of each meats and 2 grilled Roma tomatoes on each side. My favorite was the beef kubideh, then the juicy chicken filet and then the fish. $36.95   Because gratuity is already added the server wasn't as attentive as he could be. Waters were not filled until the very end of dinner.

In search of similar and different cultured tastes, I came across this place. Walked in for a late lunch. Ordered the Chicken Shish Kabob Soltani with grilled onions, tomatoes and salad and a side of rice for $16.95 as a lunch price since it was a weekend. Plenty for leftovers. Another good dish is the Chicken and filet combo dish for $15.95.

I love trader joes!! It's been a long while since I've frequented here. I picked up some frozen indian food which in my opinion is almost as good as going to an Indian restaurant; power of 7 organic juice, mango mango yogurt gummies, chocolate tamales, beer hummus, eggplant hummus, organic carrots to name a few. I could buy a whole lot more but didn't want to buy the entire store! I'm glad I came back for stocking up. Fridge love.   One star was deducted: When I was looking some cherry tomatoes there were some that had mold on it. Yuck!

Croissants, croissants and more croissants! This place is packed with baked croissgoodness of all kinds. For lunch I ordered the Philly Bastilly - roast beef, provolone, green peppers, onions and mushrooms served with a pile of crisp potato chips. Because it was so buttery good I ordered the feta and spinach croissant to go. Tastes great for breakfast. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu.

Would u like a cup of small frothiness for $4? I was a bit disappointed with what I got. I ordered a small chai tea latte and i believe they forgot the liquid part of the drink.  I have had their mac n cheese with jalapeños and that one was not too bad.    This place is good for studying, eating and chatting with different rooms to cater to those needs. Opens late too.

First time coming here I drove into the parking lot with what looks like more than half of the parking lot filled with cones for valet parking. The parking lot doesn't look like it would be difficult to get to the front door - so in a sense seemed a little pointless. I found a shaded parking luckily.   Patio seating was available. Walked in and was immediately greeted. First couple impressions was that it smells good and that the ambience was trendy and fun! The place looked pretty packed and I can tell I already want to come back for a second visit.  I was deciding on their huevos rancheros, the chiliquiles, or their brunch special: baked egg and green chilies. The server suggested the chiliquiles for $14, and boy am I glad I got that!! It's chicken and hard fried egg topped with pico de gallo and a red and green sauce. OMG!! Delicious!! Ate every single bite. And then enjoyed a couple mugs full of French press for $3. Maybe more than one is not suggested because I became jittery.   The whole time I was a bit hot. At first I thought it was the tiny spiciness of the food but I guess the ac wasn't turned down enough or something. The women's bathroom has 3 stalls and the first one was doorless!!! How?!?! Kinda weird for a place that has valet parking.   Overall I enjoyed my experience there and would come back for the food and ambience!!

It's been a while since I've been here until recently. Enjoyed happy hour with Blue crab cakes (2) on a bed of greens and special mango salsa sauce for half price of $6. A friend ordered wings for $5 and we shared the trio dessert for $9 - mini chocolate soufflé, mini lemon soufflé and mini peach apple cobbler with ice cream. That was the order of best to least-best. I need to come back here for the missed adult mac-n-cheese filled with chicken, bacon, mushrooms and other bits of stuff with a side of truffle oil. Mouthwatering just typing this. You know what means. Yes-time to go back there soon!   Good for watching sports and good for group dinners and for beer lovers. All sorts to choose from.

Coming here on a Friday night will be a for sure wait of 30-45 minutes- with no reservations taken. Luckily their grocery next door is stocked with trinkets of all sorts (i.e. La grande orange t-shirts, phoenix t-shirts, 7 year pen, candles, soap, books and all kinds of goodies). If you're looking to pick up food, the grocery store has pre-made salads, gelato, desserts and to-go menu items available. There are cheeses and wines to purchase to go and at the table. If you're not into the browsing of items then there is an open bar area to grab a drink.   Within 30 minutes the hostess found me and said the table will be ready in a minute! Purchased a Pinot noir for the table of 5. Henry the waiter grabbed waters and lemon for us at the start. We did the family style and ordered 12 piece wings (which we were jipped by one lonely wing) and they were darn good with a bit of char; shrimp ceviche with chips; chopped salad with pepperoni; and roasted corn pizza.   Wings came out first with celery sticks and radish halves. Full of meat on those bones. Then the roasted corn pizza was next with sprinkled roasted corn and sliced tomatoes all over the pizza that was married to the cheese with floating leaves of basil. Ceviche was served in a goblet drink ware filled with chunks of shrimp, chopped onions and tomatoes topped with avocado pieces. Add a squeeze of lime to enhance the flavors.  Salad looked like for a serving for one. We were not quite full and went with another half order of wings and another roasted corn pizza. Done.   Not quite yet. Made room for dessert: mint choc chip scoop and salted caramel scoop of gelato. Yum!   Only part to not getting the full 5 stars was our waters were never filled. I drank my water to the last drop with not even an ice cube to melt. Overall, dining experience and food choices were a 4 star. I'll be back very soon.

So far Essence Bakery has been my top fave for macaroons in AZ! Vibrant colors and a punch of flavors, such as grapefruit, chocolate espresso, lemon, raspberry, and vanilla bean rum.   Breakfast goods: gruyere Cheese croissant (3.50). Quiche Lorraine with a cup of fruit ($8.25). Essence French Scramble eggs with Dijon mustard and chives and a side of toast with butter and jam ($6.75).   If you're on their mailing list you will always get the week's specialty menu.

Don't let this simple hidden treasure keep you from coming here. This is tucked in a grocery store with authentic spices and cooking for an affordable meal! It's like having street eats! :) You just grab one of the yellow sheets and mark what you want and then leave it in the basket. The staff will take the order while you sit. Sip on some water while waiting.  The last time I came here I ordered the Aloo Tikki Chaat. This is vegetarian dish made of the  Tikki (potato patty) made of potatoes, green chili, corn flour, lentils, chili powder and other spices) served with chopped onions, green chutney (spicy sauce), tamarind chutney (sweet sauce) and yogurt. I also ordered Special #1:  rice pulao (mixed veggie rice), bhatura (equivalent to a Mexican tortilla), matar paneer (cheese-like curds) and pickle (pickled veggies that probably the inexperienced palate will not be able to master).   These dishes have so many flavors!! Give it a try! :)

An all time favorite. I remember when it was first opened by the original owners and now it has flourished and sold off to new owners who also have another location in Gilbert.   I love the variety of flavors such as seasonal flavors, the chocolate based flavors ( rocky road, bacio, German chocolate cake, tiramisu, etc.) as well as their fruity flavors (mango, strawberry, lemon, etc.) But my ultimate go-to is the ferro Roche.   The gelato shop has a nice simplicity to it and has it colors of orange, blue and white. They have options of a small, medium and large size cups where the medium cup can have 2 flavors for just under $5. I like eating with the tiny colorful spoons. And then they top off the gelato with waffle cone triangles. Deliciousness.

On a whim went here for dinner. Sits in the Pollack Tempe plaza close to the cinemas, comic store, etc. the restaurant is decorated with large Thai art like the huge floating market painting and huge faces of the Buddha and notes of bamboo dividers between some tables and the entrance walk-in. Smells of the food resonated from the nose to my tummy.   So much to choose from: March specials and regular menu items. I had to try the Drunken Noodles and the Panang Curry which are my Go-to dishes.   Drunken noodles: Mild. Chicken. Onions. Bell peppers. Tomato. Napa cabbage. Thai basil. Flat noodles. Sweet. Savory. $10.50  Panang Curry. Medium. Chicken. String beans. Red bell peppers. Lime leaves. Coconut milk. One small bowl of rice. Sweet n savory.  $12  Fried Banana with ice cream. $7.50  Small bowl of rice: $1.50. Disappointingly a little overpriced especially since the Panang curry came with only one small bowl to begin with. I personally think the Panang curry should have at least come with 2 small bowl worth of rice. The rest of the curry liquid needs the rice to complement the dish.   I originally wanted the March special dessert: mango and blueberry stuffed crepe for $5.99 but unfortunately they were out!!   Waitress and staff were smiley, polite and helpful!

Terrible slow service. No line concept. Sloth-like working service. Literally stood in line for 10 minutes while everyone behind decided to cut to other registers without any concept that people are also in line.. None of the workers are working together. Condiments were not stocked. Area is dirty.

I had a strong craving for ramen noodle soup so I came to my favorite authentic Japanese restaurant!! Just in time before they close at 10pm. Always great to see and be greeted by the owners who are so delightful. The tonkatsu ramen pork based broth noodle soup with 3 large slices of pork, half boiled egg, sprouts, and greens was so flavorful and comforting to me. Comes with salad or edamame and California roll- all for $8.75.   They have new drinks called so-chu for $5 with different flavors such as strawberry and mango for those that enjoy those kind of drinks.

Minus this place being so crowded you can always buy a large quantity of items for a decent price. Be prepared to spend more than what you expected on your debit card or Amex credit card. To be methodical and logical start by ordering a super large pizza cheese/veggie/supreme pizza for $10 to go -it's the best deal.  Oh but be sure to take advantage of the scanners for a faster check out - accepting cards only (mentioned earlier).  Look at the electronics, and pick up photos if you have any. Check out the jewelry area if you're so inclined to really shop.  Food trial stations throughout the area for you hungry snackers. Scan for some reasonably priced basic seasonal clothing, furniture and other items. Maybe if you need to pick up medicine from the pharmacy or need an eye check up you can definitely come here. After you have loaded your shopping cart with tons of items go straight to the scanner check out. Pick up your pizza and then head straight to the doors with your receipt ready.  You made it!!  Sometimes you have to come here often just in case your fave foods are not in "season." Also, you can come here for replacing tires and gassing up your car. One stop shop for almost everything here.

My favorite Thai restaurant in AZ!! This place has a drive thru to pick up your food!! This is so convenient when doing take out!  Friendly  owners and staff. You can customize dishes by meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu) and by spiciness. Favorites are:   -Paht Kee Mow with chicken noodle dish mixed with stir fry variety of sprouts, carrots, onion, and broccoli.  -red curry with chicken with bamboo shoots, broccoli and other veggies. -seasonal mango over sweet sticky rice and coconut milk to dress the whole thing for a sweet treat!

Finally made it out to brunch!! Wait was around 10-15 minutes. Sign your name on the yellow pad and take a seat on the bench or porch. Since the weather is nice a table outside was most appropriate. Took a taste of the quiche (which was not as well seasoned but topped with bacon) with a salad with strawberries, blackberry, grapes and pineapple; warm tuna melt on sourdough sandwich with fries; and buttery Apple pancakes. (I think this is an entry to making my own Apple pancakes!!)

The tuna melt melted in the mouth with the crispy toasted bread to catch the melt, while the apple pancakes was a nice sweet dish that was considered as my brunch dessert.  Every bite was worth coming. I'm due to visit again.

Yummy yum yum! This is one of my favorite Korean restaurants to eat. First, if you have never explored korean food you're missing out. Okay - I agree service isn't always the best in many asian restaurants but it can be overcome by the fulfillment of their food.    For you first timers you definitely have to come with a group to share family style. As a basic starter - which is very unique than any other restaurant - is that they serve about 6 to 8 mini side dishes of various sorts to accompany your entrees. Examples might be kimchi (spicy sour fermented veggies usually cabbage), pickled spicy daikon (a white carrot), dry seasoned seaweed, garlic seasoned potatoes, seasoned bean sprouts, and pickled cucumbers to name a few. Not to worry!! You'll only have to try a bit of it and if you don't like it at least you can say you tried it.   On to the main entrees!! You will for sure like a popular dish: BBQ beef bulgogi served with grilled marinated onions on a cast iron hot plate. Dak bulgogi (BBQ chicken) and galbi (short ribs) are also great options or additions to enjoy, and are also served the same way. You will be asked how spicy you like it too. If in a group, you might as well try the kimchi beef tofu soup served in a stone pot. Say yes to the egg in it. Let it sit and sizzle for a few minutes prior to eating. Eat this with rice. Rice is served in a mini silver looking bowl with a lid. Another dish to try is the bibimbap which is sliced bulgogi, sautéed veggies, an egg on top over a bed of rice served in a large stone bowl. If you like noodles then you might try the japchae - clear noodles with seasoned veggies and meat.   After all has been said and eaten, you'll be super stuffed! At least I was! Let me know what you think! ;)

Great service! For a table of about 12 for a retirement luncheon the servers topped off all drinks at a consistent and frequent basis. Rare to find these days. Maybe it helps that a couple loyal guests knew the manager and have been always kind. The manager greeted the locals and the rest of the team with smiles and laughs. Always good to see a manager interact with his customers for a short moment.   Before ordering the sever asked if we wanted separate checks or one bill and someone on our group made the executive decision to go with one bill. 2 servers started asking each person for their order.   Their menu items show calories per entree. It is rather daunting that my decision for selecting a plate had changed when I saw that the garlic Alfredo pasta was around 1840 calories!! Sheesh I believe that's roughly almost a day's worth of caloric consumption for a lady my size! I'm not a person to count calories on what I consume but that number was too astounding for me to even order it. Sadly, i didn't choose it and went with their chimichurri garden burger- which was half the calories. The "bad fried" parts was the fried onion strings and my choice of fries. (Other choice is salad).  Kind of defeats my choosing this instead of the Alfredo pasta. Oh well. The garden burger was pretty decent. I'm a firm believer of trying new foods.   At the end of the lunch we received our check. Everyone contributed equal payment which was easy and painless.

A major sweet tooth requires a major sweet treat: Sprinkles cupcakes and its intensely sweet frosting decorated with their signature dot and other cute designs.   My favorite flavors include: dark chocolate with sprinkles, chai latte, ginger lemon, lemon, lemon coconut, mocha.   I like their cute and lightly wooden-like forks and knives, stamped with the Sprinkles logo. Cupcakes are best eaten on the day of.  If you choose to eat half for whatever reason the cake part will dry out. Do not put in the fridge. Also they sell different flavored cupcake mix,  mini dog treats and other items.

I've been here a couple times and enjoyed both dining experiences. The first time I participated in the $5 olive mill tour which was about 15-20 minutes. They let you tour their olive press and the making of their oils. Should be good for the kiddos.  You order your breakfast (before 11am) or lunch and pay at the cash register. They have a display of their cupcakes made with olive oil. (I suggest the lemon Meyer and chocolate cupcake). Go for the Manzi panini. Then you wait for your order and grab a table. TVs are available to watch your sports for you sports fans out there. ;)   This place has taste testings throughout the place for olives, olive oil and BBQ sauce and more. They have gift packages of their popular items and other non-olive oil items.   Sometimes the olive mill has events going on which makes it even more fun. Outside seating is also available to enjoy the nice weather. Good times.

If you like variety then this is definitely calling your name. Not only can you grocery shop for wholesome foods you can also dine in/out for some happy hour and regular menu items. They have a deli area with a side selection of cold foods to take home. There is a Japanese section like sushi and udon noodles. Other areas like the sandwich shop, pizza, burger, salad bar, olive bar and grill area, hot bar and a colorful dessert section!  My most recent tastes were the udon noodle soup (more of a light broth for you salt lovers) from the Japanese section, vegetarian sandwich (definitely salty) and chicken sandwich (was a bit on the dry side) from the grill.   They have colorful macaroons that are just okay. Still nice to have but I have had way better else where.  Their bear claws were stale.   Their grocery item,Thai coconut curry hummus is definitely one to try! Salivating for it!  Still more to explore and will be back many more times!

Oh boy....I hate to do this but I have to.  For a table of 8 with 5 November birthdays, this would be a place NOT to come back to. The "enticing" $30 birthday certificate allows you the $30 off their teppan specialties with a purchase of a full price teppan dish Monday through Thursday.   Cocktail: Benihana Plum Wine - from Berkeley (me thinks) $7.50 for the glass. This is a regular plum wine.   Specialties:  6 course meals comes with: Onion and mushroom soup, salad, sauteed shrimp, zucchini, mushrooms and onions. Served with their mustard sauce and ginger sauce. Steamed rice. Hot green tea. ice cream or sorbet.   My pick: Deluxe Treat $38. - Filet mignon (medium rare) and a cooked lobster tail with garlic butter and lemon. This is a normal surf and turf meal cooked before your eyes.   The teppan chef first started with cleaning the teppan top. Oil, then made the beating heart fried rice (which is an optional for an additional $5). Next up is cooking the zucchini, mushrooms and making the onion volcano and choo-choo train. Then was the chicken, steak, filet mignon and lobster tails.   Menu books changed from the nicely bounded one to the economical thin and easily replaceable, cleanable menu books.   Overall: 0-star rating Minus a star: Server failed to provide the hot green tea.  Minus a star: Server forgot about the ice cream.  Minus a star: Server didn't take, nor offer the birthday pictures Minus a star: Server never refilled waters Minus a star: Server messed up the checks  I doubt the birthday recipients enjoyed the birthday experience. Better dine on a non-birthday.

Waited for about 20 minutes for dinner but they do make use of technology by texting you when your seats are ready!! A plus!! :)  Soft Shell Crab appetizer: Uhhhhh what happened??!! This time around the portion was mini me size!! The waitress advised that it was the time of the season.  I remember around summer  time it was twice the size!! That was a downer for me.  Albacore Crunch Role: This is similar to eating ahi tuna but a cheaper grade. Filled with mix of bits of shrimp and imitation crab and ponzu sauce. I could eat another one of these.  Yellowtail Toro (belly fat): Ummm.....thought this was supposed to melt in your mouth kind of texture?? Wasn't pleased with this one as I'm used to the tuna toro.  Lotus on Fire Roll: Spicy tuna with the same shrimp and imitation crab mix and a lotus root chip.  Dynamite Roll: Baked onions and mushroom and scallops also with the imitation crab and some spicy mayo sauce.     Enjoyed the atmosphere.  My belly was super 3 month prego-lookin! ;)

Today I was just plain tired or just a hungry monkey drained of energy and cold. The hunt for Chasu ramen was found here!! Found some slices of nice marbled fatty sweet pork, bean sprouts, oodles of noodles, sprinkled green onions all in the light based broth. Mmm hot soup in the belly was comforting. :)  also came with a choice of side salad or miso soup. The spider roll is also a great choice if you like soft shell crab. Veggie ramen was peppery salty with a kick of spice and lots of greens. Service was super!! Merry Christmas Eve!

For a dinner at the Hyatt Regency this restaurant did me well. It's a swanky place where you can dress for an occasion- as we have seen the next table over celebrate 35 years of marriage!   A starter menu of mini finger foods to select is given along with the regular menu. Knowing what we all wanted for dinner, we dove in for the entree because we all know that we have to save room for dessert!  The server first asked if we dined with them before and since it was our first time he asked if we had any questions about the menu. I had to ask about the confit crispy duck leg and pan seared duck breast since it is one of my faves. My other to-eat-wish-list item was the baked ziti with braised short rib. I decided to go with the dual duck plate to try the different cooking style. The pan seared duck breast looked like cut slices of a beef filet with a hint taste of liver undertones. Paired with the sweet and sour glaze and toasted pine nuts complemented the taste quite well. Cutting into the crispy confit part was delicious and easy. Biting into the crispness of the skin and soft parts of the meat worked well too. Brussel spouts, pearl onions and other winter vegetables gave an earthy and comfort side to the dish.   Dessert: knowing me I had to choose the dessert that seem like the not as popular: white chocolate panna cotta. I love panna cotta if made right. This was categorized as rich and decadent! Aka made to share with others. This was presented in a giant saucer looking plate. At first glance it looked like the dessert was missing but it was a small bowl sized dessert with 2 slivers of circle cut honey glazed pear, brown butter whipped cream and bits of dried cut apricot. The texture of the panna cotta itself was thick and creamy. For some reason it had an orange undertone to the panna cotta -which I'm not opposed to because I live oranges.   The only star that was docked off was my water refill. At the beginning of the meal my water was filled to the rim. By dessert time I didn't get a single refill.

How about some veggie type dishes? Here is a great place to make your kids or adults eat some type of veggie - with a couple notches of spiciness! This time around I ate the masala dosa which is a crispy like crepe filled with a potato mix $8, a paneer dosa - rice crepe filled with layers of paneer and onion $8. Also Paneer butter masala curry made with tomato onion in sauce with homemade cheese (the paneer) $9. Ended lunch with carrot halwala dessert made with shredded carrots, dried fruit and milk and sweets less than $3

Ooh! Another jewel found! I have a usual place for Vietnamese food but they happen to be on vacation. Luckily I came here! And luckily I have a couple Yelp friends' reviews to confirm the tastiness!!   I was looking for a rice dish and found #41!! The "lip smackin' good BBQ pork"! If I could give words to describe the dish it would be those exact ones: lip smackin' good BBQ pork!! Comes with 3 grilled shrimps, a side of pickled veggies and of course the jasmine rice and fish sauce. Drooling for another dish. $8.95  The chicken curry noodle soup is just as delicious with a kick of spice! You can sub the noodles with jasmine rice or toasted bread. Chicken chunks (with bones) and rice noodles, sweet potatoes and bell peppers bathed in the creamy coconut curry soup. Boneless would have been nice. $7.95  The lunch experience was delicious. Prices were a bit higher than what I expected but the decor compensated and the food was lip smackin' good! ;)

I've been here a few times and always enjoy each visit. First of all, when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles  and courteousness of the staff. You get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor. And of course, the many flavorful dishes that they offer! Their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled. That's an A+ :)  This time around I tried papadum which is a  starter. It looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder, rice powder and some different spices. You can practically eat these non-stop!   Favorites/Chicken/Tandoors/Bread/Dessert: - Rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices. You can eat this with their saffron cumin rice.  - Gudaspuri Mutter Paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices. Great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake! ;) palak paneer (spinach and cheese) is also good.  - Gazab Ka Kadahi Murgh which is a BBQ boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt. This is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay oven. Once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt sauce and mixed with onions, bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce.  - Tandoori Murgh (chicken) cooked in the clay oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon.  - Pani Puri which is small finger foods. "Street food"  Little chip-like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick peas. Pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce.  - Garlic Naan is hands down my favorite garlic naan I have tasted!! If you're wanting garlic naan then come here to eat it. It's soft  ,airy, fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top!  - Ras Malai (sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks) homemade dessert. Think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture. Really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream sauce.  - Halwa which is a Carrot fudge (sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios, cashews, and golden raisins. Really innovative for a homemade dessert!   Overall I loved this place because I can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and I can always expect great friendly service from their staff. Gotta come check this place out! Mmm mmm gooddd! Only thing I regret was not taking pics of the delicious foods!! Next time. ;)

Deliciousness all the way! Portobello picnic was very savory with the arugula, roasted tomatoes and zucchini, and ricotta cheese, and the cinnamon French toast was sweet and wholesome with melted butter and warm syrup on top.  It was a bit crowded with tables so close.  Then, I saw a guy just put his whole hand in the bread bites and made it kinda nasty especially when there was tongs available to pick up the bread. Yuck! Makes you wonder how many others did the same.

Like cheap eats? Then this one is sure to keep your wallet/purse/card in shape. You can dine in or order out and your order of a few dishes will take about 15 minutes to cook for under $20 for 2 people, plus leftovers. :)   I love the beef roll which is beef rolled in an onion pancake. The steamed rice bowl is a bit of minced pork with chopped cilantro and a nice savory sauce over a bowl mound of gelatinous rice. Give it a try! The house special basil chicken is sure to please anyone. And the chicken noodles is colorfully made with a spicy flavor.

Came here with a large group and waited about 15-20 minutes for a table of 15. The  hummus with grilled chicken $10 and the mahi mahi with pita chips $11 are my 2 favorite dishes. "Instead of a mahi mahi, can I get just the mahi?" Lol anyone recognize this line?  Good for kids because they have a kids fun kit filled with crayons and a fun sheet.  As usual, all pita jungle locations have local art work on the walls for sale.

First off when I went to the drive thru I had a crazy lady in a hurry and cutting me off. At least she was quick about her order. I was at the pay window and for some reason they took a bit longer for one of 3 of my drinks. They offered the drink carrier. I wish they had drink stoppers as I was cautiously driving to prevent any spills. Finally tasted my mocha latte with almond milk.....uh....tasted watery and not as good. This place had mediocre coffee. Maybe I'll just stick with the donuts.

Been here a couple times for lunch pick up. Outside patio looks inviting to enjoy lunch. Quaint area. And next to a coffee shop!  The second time I decided to get the Chipotle Black Bean Burger. I was in the mood for vegetarian healthy food. Super flavorful black bean patty mixed with onions, garlic, cilantro, corn, bell peppers, carrots, oats, cranberries, jalapeño peppers, chipotle peppers and a blend of spices on a bun with chipotle hummus, lettuce, pea sprouts, tomatoes.  Paired with cut garlic potatoes.    I'll be back again! :)

I have not been to a Panda Express in a long time- over a year. I love their orange chicken and chicken with string beans with noodles. Service is fast. Fortune cookie comes with your meal. My 2-entree meal with noodles was about $7. Was out the door in about 4 minutes.

Any of the Sumits location is great to fit in an 80 minute session of hot yoga. All of the staff is awesome and really help you out to perfect yoga poses during each session. And they have hard wood floors and not the nasty carpets. Ugh!   I re-started again after a year and half being busy but am glad to be back! You really get to sweat out all of your pores - as if I don't already sweat enough!! So for those of you who are lucky non-sweating people you gotta try this. ;)  Aside from leaving all the mental stress of your daily life at the beginning of the class, the first half is about getting used to the basic poses, breathing correctly and being at peace with yourself. Second half lets you go through the various flows and raises your heart beat. You really get a good wholesome workout! And then you end in a shavasana pose aka the resting "dead pose." This allows the circulation to flow throughout your body and return to resting heart rate.   Just make sure you wash all your towels and clothing and yoga mat immediately after class. You don't want that gross mildew smell. Blah!  Drink lots of water before and after. Don't go on a full stomach because you don't want tummy issues. Enjoy what the class has to offer! And feel good about yourself because you got a really sweaty workout and relieved all that stress! ;)

After being absent for around 4 months or so I came back to a newly managed Sumits Yoga. New beginnings for a new workout regimen. The setup was changed up with a couple high tables and chairs, as well as a table for retail goods immediately when you walk in. I appreciate the cozy look of the layout but I just wonder how often yogis are actually hanging out on the high tables and chairs.  I prefer an open layout. Change is good so maybe people might like it more! :)   I noticed that the Monday 530pm class was highly sparse than the last time I attended months ago. What happened?! At the same time it was nice because it wasn't too crowded and you can have lots of space around you.   The instructors from the past 2 classes I attended this year were friendly yogis. I'm looking forward to more hot yoga classes! Who wants to join? :)

Yummy for vegan all natural organic eatery. I've been here before but didn't get a chance to eat so I finally made a point to do so for a late lunch. Where to start? Menu: food menu and drink menu (healthy drinks) were plentiful! I had no idea what to choose for either of them. I finally decided to go for the supreme burrito and the blue lagoon smoothie.   Supreme burrito = grilled spinach tortilla stuffed with brown rice, kale, carrots, zucchini, other farm veggies, beans, cheese and guacamole and cashew sour cream. Smothered with enchilada sauce with a side of purple cabbage ginger slaw and a couple slices of oranges. Not sure if I could really taste that but sounded so unique! This can definitely fill a hungry man's stomach if he's not the type to eat healthy food. $14  Blue lagoon smoothie = blueberry. pineapple. Spirulina. Chia. Kale. Coconut h2o. Brain on (helps focus. de stress. Lifts mood). Topped with a couple frozen blueberries and a couple squares of pineapple. This was surprisingly  blue-licious!! $14 - yes $14 for a drink!! Better have had given me all those health benefits!  Baked goods = seasonal pomegranate cake and their thick chocolate chip with oats, walnuts and choc chip! $8 and $3 respectively.   All in all this place was quite delicious and healthy. Servers were nice. Waters were given in jars and to go cups. You can enjoy eating outside as well as inside. One part of my food had a possible hair but I think I will try to ignore that part..  Minus that tidbit of un-welcomed thing I will give it another shot. The desserts and drinks are begging me to come back.

For a fast food place this one is a top pick to go to. It has everything chicken and tastes so good. I've eaten the Asian salad with honey sesame dressing, the chicken biscuit, the chicken egg & cheese on sunflower multigrain bagel, chick fil a deluxe chicken sandwich, their classic chicken sandwich. All of them were definitely meant to be how it is sold as. Crispy chicken and tender. Smells appetizing.   I like that they have the drive thru lines alternating style so the orders can be taken as it comes and in queue. Except for one time that I went the employee had a hard time hearing me to the point that someone who came after me on the other line got their order first while I was still ordering mine! And the other customer was confused as to why I was still ordering and didn't move forward in the drive thru line. Ha! If she only knew.... :/  I wish they were open on Sundays but I respect the resting day! :)

What's magical about this place? It's the actual making of the noodles and its authenticity! Oodles of noodles!  The skilled chef and the art of noodle making can be seen in the back of the restaurant as you are eating. My fave dish is #22 minced pork noodles with julienned cucumber slices, on a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with scallions. You're able to select the type of noodle but I always go with the hand pulled noodles. It's a great take-out item. I've also tried the beef noodle stew with the hand pulled noodles. If you're dining in you will most likely be served with a plate of steamed peanuts lightly salted and de-shelled. Try picking it up with your chopsticks for those of you that are chopstick challenged. ;)  This place is awesome because it's considered a cheap eat! Who doesn't love that?

For a weekend night it was a 45 minute wait maybe because it was First Friday going on. Suggested by a friend.   Took the first available table and ended up inside. Bliss Rebar looked small with large mirrors inside to make it look more roomier.   Appetizer: Cheesy Mac Balls. This is a good comfort food and can easily order another one.   I really wanted to try the Black Bean Burger but they were out! So I ended up getting their 4th Street Tacos which comes with 3 small tortillas filled with chicken, onions, queso, lime, cilantro and all the good stuff  and chipotle sauce. This dish is something I could put together but was still good. Not the best. If only!! I had gotten the black bean burger.   Sweets: Bliss Brownie a la mode topped with a strawberry and a couple blackberries. Ehh it was more like the bottom edges of the brownie was literally stuck to the ramekin and had to put so much force of the spoon to etch off the ramekin. Lots of arm work to eat this one.   Service was mediocre. We didn't get a refill of water until we asked for it. It was a self service for some ketchup for a friends fries.   And the check was a jumbled up.

Just steps away from the escalators up, an open entry for an outdoor dining and an accommodating bar and dining area awaits a booth of four. The booths felt like a table for 8 or a table for 4 big guys! The adjoining wall  had a "open view" just enough to see the booth next to us of what they're eating and the hands moving across the table.   We began with a mini sampler of the prosciutto, cheese, and truffle oil on a crostini. It was so good that we went with the Parma sampler for about $30 with 3 meats of prosciutto, salami and Hot Coppa that had a kick to it. The rest of the platter came with goat cheese, fontina cheese and grana padana cheese, spiced figs, roasted red peppers, braised escarole, and rosemary mustard with more crostini. Already getting full I managed to finish the 5 of the 10 ounce filet mignon with fingerling potatoes and asparagus for about $30.  Medium rare is the way to go.  My water was never filled until I had asked for it at the very end and then I received an over abundance of water refills later. Better late than never I guess. Hehe.  The evenings dinner was delicious and filling but didn't have room for their bread pudding - which should be a yummy on my list! :p

Brunch at The HerbBox was overall tasty!! Smoked salmon hash was perfect for a great savory dish. The portobello manchego burger was unfortunately burnt/charred around the edges. The bourbon ginger peach brioche French toast was equivalent to a dense bread pudding - a nice brunch dessert! To top it off, l enjoyed outside seating, great weather while listening to live music!

With 777 reviews how could you pass this up? I finally made time to come here and I am so glad I did! :) I'm a really big fan of pork belly and look what I found: Pork belly pastrami starter!!! This place has surpassed any other pork belly I've tasted thus far in AZ! The pork belly melted in my mouth and matched well with the brussels sprouts. The truffled grilled cheese meshed with the white truffle mashed potatoes. Ended with the Cocoa Jar with chocolate crispies and cookie and whip cream in a jar.  With an eclectic menu I'm sure to come back for the short ribs - another of my favorite entrees to try. There was a mixed crowd of people here. Service was great and my water was always filled. Great job guys!!  P.S. So sorry that I forgot to take pics of the pork belly pastrami and grilled cheese. Devoured it all. Next time though.

Second time here was not as pleasant as the first visit. This was during restaurant week. I loved dining the first time and was excited to dine the second time. This time around I tried the Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn for $5, their Fair Trade Short Ribs which is prepared with a coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veggies for $30; and their Bread Pudding for $6. The Bacon Fat Heirloom Popcorn was regular popcorn with bacon bits and fat. If you're a bacon lover you might want to taste this. It's a simple snack to munch on while reviewing the rest of the menu.  Hmm how shall I put this ....... I can only equate the entree dish to nothing but "Fair" - exactly as it says!! And I didn't get a fair trade at all either for $30. It was coffee rubbed so dry and over cooked that my jaws  were gnawing on each piece pretending to like that darn meat! I dipped each piece in the cherry BBQ sauce but it was still parched and punishing experience to the mouth. Luckily I had asked for the bread pudding which was well hydrated served with strawberries and cream. This is a restaurant week dessert not in their main menu.   The final straw of the evening was the check for a party of 9. At the bottom of their menu it states in fine print: Split checks unavailable for parties larger than 8. First of all, the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own separate check leaving 8 people left. If you allowed one person then you must do for the rest at the same table.  Was she afraid she wouldn't get her 20% or more gratuity? If the waitress allowed one person in the group to have their own check the group becomes 8 people or less. Which means we CAN technically split the check any which way. Instead the waitress proceeds to tell us she can't do that. And on top of that she proceeds to tell us that we need to calculate our own tax and tip!! You mean to tell us that a nice sophisticated restaurant lacks a POS system with zero capabilities of generating the math for you?!?!?!  Here's another kicker: At the bottom of the original receipt the waitress hand wrote herself a 20% gratuity. Again, the POS system lacked being able to incorporate the added gratuity on a receipt and the total cost. I find that a shocker. After the whole fiasco and doing our own calculations and making it inconvenient for us diners we were glad it was over. The experience overall was a disaster but the bacon popcorn and bread pudding made up for a bit of it.  Maybe a hit and miss type of deal. :/ Never dine here with a group more than 8.

This has been an all time favorite dining that I haven't visited in months. Glad I came back. As we walked up to the host area a slew of people were sitting and waiting for their tables. Of course the wait for a table was 30 minutes-ish. The hostesses luckily had square sampling of thin crust pizza to calm the hunger. While waiting we went over to the bar area where I sipped on a moscato.  Cold crisp sweet adult grape juice! One seat at the bar was so close to the dusty register that it was a good thing that we didn't eat food there. Kind of awkward to be dining with wires from the register in front of your face and no room to eat.   Table finally arrived and with so many choices we picked the Oreganos favorite salad, Parmesan line wings and Alfredo the dark. The waitress asked if we wanted one of the plates to come first and I suggested that the salad come first. ....... Nope. Didn't happen. All the plates came out at the same time - as not suggested and waiting so long for the salad that should not have taken 15 minutes-ish.   The salad is always great because it's reasonably packed with kalamata olives, romaine lettuce, feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onion rings, pine nuts and honey vinegarette. The pine nuts tasted stale and old. Luckily those dropped to the bottom of the plate. Wings were great. The pasta dish was supposed to be composed of the poblanos pasta diced Roma tomatoes and cream. For some reason I didn't get much of the poblano punch in it. This was more of a vanilla dish for me.   Leftovers were packed in front of the table - which is how every restaurant should pack. The night was overly stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey but enjoyed the many bites.

Ehh this place was okay.  Didn't impress me. Only came here because Santan brewery had a 1.5 hour wait!! Anyway this place had TVs around the restaurant. I was looking for a lighter than usual meal and was deciding between Baja Power Bowl and Grilled Steak Cobb. The deciding factor was when I saw the next table order the grilled steak Cobb. It was a piled high neatly layered cylindrical and colorful salad with arugula on the bottom, chopped red onions, chopped tomatoes, avocado, cheese, grilled steak with a 2 inch high pile of fried shoe string onions. So hey! Why not try it!!  Oh what a disaster. When I received my plate it was nothing like the one I saw in the next table. First off I did not even get any shoestrings piled high - only had a few soggy breaded onion strings - like three or four pieces that were smashed to a smidge of the top. The grilled steak was super chewy. There was an overdose of gigantic chopped red onions. There was not any Gorgonzola cheese - instead I got chunks of blue cheese.  Looks can be deceiving. I didn't like what I ate but ate it anyway.   Too bad I didn't have a good experience. :/

Nami goodness for $5.  Chai tsunami, O ginger snap, rocky road and Coffee Coco Loco are all pretty phenomenal. Great for those that are lactose intolerant. Tastes light. These treats are tasty even when melted from the summer heat. Parking is limited.

Think upscale barn meets trendy decor. Started with the Italian farm salad for a mix of Molinari salami, roasted red peppers, red onions, olives topped with thin slices of provolone cheese and just enough Italian vinaigrette. The fork kept coming back for more bites!! Then had a slice of traditional margherita pizza. And then devoured the ricotta gnocchi with small chunks of soft braised beef short rib, lightly covered with horseradish cream, and wilted arugula for a full flavored dish. And wait.....not done!! I know- I have an appetite for foodie food. Finished with the beignets that was complemented with a lemon cream sauce for dessert. All in all, the dinner was scrumptious, the ambience was lively and the place is telling me to come back for more! :)

Hands down phenomenal service with a smile along with the best dishes - not leaving a single bite left in the plate. Started with steamed mussels $12, then the Italian farm salad (salami, green olives, roasted red peppers, tomato, cucumber, mixed greens, provolone cheese and Italian vinaigrette) on a bruschetta board $12, and finished with the medium rare NY strip entree $34. Too full for dessert. I love coming here!! Valet service was great!

Table was ready for 4 and a baby. I've been here for dinner and drinks but never been here for Sunday brunch so decided to give it a try. Actually the original intention was to find chocolate banana pancakes from the day before but noticed it was only a brunch for Sunday- not Saturday. Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija  cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork. Others ordered the Bear Republic (chicken breast sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bacon with a side of dill mustard like potato salad) for $12.50, and the Picadinho (diced NY strip steak, peas, rum sauce, Brazilian rice, 2 eggs made how you like and a side of seasonal fruit) for $16. A list of cocktails are also available like sangria and mimosa. Cool place for brunch.

Great place for bruschetta (4) full slices for $14 and Italian picnic salad for $9. Since this place is always packed we took the first available seating out the patio on an after-rainy day. Although it was humid there were misters to help cool down. Water glasses should be a bit bigger because I was a thirsty lion slurping on the ice- shaking the ice to help melt for drips of water. Finally I asked to refill on water. Saved!! It's a necessity for AZ.

Receptionist Cesily (not sure if that's spelled correct) was friendly. Jeff took my vitals and made my visit as fast as possible and was extremely helpful. Jason gave the the final news and gave me my post op shoe for my broken toe. Super nice. Went home with a cd of my X-rays and a list of podiatrists. What a day! Must be the almost-full moon. Sigh. :/

Waited in a long line for a tropical rush smoothie with mango, pineapple, banana juice and yogurt. After 10 minutes-ish got my drink. First sip had plastic wrapper bits in it. Thought it was a one time thing. Nope. Got another bit of plastic wrap or something. Brought it back and it looked a bit different with seeds in it. I was right!! I ended up with a different drink: strawberry tango. Ugh. Forget going back!! I might get spit in it. :/ although the drink was refreshing the incidents set this review back a few stars.

This is a mid-size farmers market. There are a couple rows of tents featuring handmade soaps, home-baked goods, crêpes, fresh produce, knitted goods, and other items.   The thing I love about going to the farmers market is getting fresh produce. I like getting the different varieties that you don't see in the grocery stores such as the red colored carrots and the orange colored beets and green tomatoes. The last couple times I went they had various sizes and colors tomatoes, fennel bulb, colored beets, cucumbers, squash, Zucchini, carrots, bell peppers,spring mix salad, herbs, jalapenos, strawberries, duck eggs and regular farm fresh eggs and many others. It would be nice to see even more items and more variety of fresh produce. But I think for the owners they have done a splendid job with the amount at their tent!   My intention this time was to get the Persian cucumbers and orange beets. This time around they didn't have the Persian cucumbers so I went along and bought the orange beets, fennel bulb, leeks, and the green tomatoes.   During this time of the year the farmers market opens at 8 AM and closes around 12 PM. Credit cards and cash are welcomed.

Right when you walk in you can already feel the vibe. Great vibes that is!! Some music, attentive staff, and customers enjoying the crepes galore!   All you have to do is order at the counter where all the assorted off-menu pastries are and pay using the square attached to the iPad. You can have the receipt emailed or printed. It gives you a suggested tip too!   The staff brought out their homemade CB cereal made of granola and dried fruit served in a teeny tiny bowl (the size of a sake cup) with whole milk and baby spoons to use all presented on a slate board. And then came their porridge with some barley and oats of some sort served cold in a bowl that was a bit bigger. A sweet sensation.   Now comes the crepes!! Savory: Shared the Chicken Pesto with white cheddar, skinny caramelized onions and slivered circle red onions; and the Smokey (with turkey, smoked gouda, avocado and chorizo) each encased in a the thin crepe. Both were accompanied with a mini simple greens. Smokey had a more robust flavor from the smoked gouda while the chicken pesto was searching for more of the pesto.   Sweet: Pick Me Up-- this is very innovative as far as infusing the coffee into the crepe with a shiny coffee glaze alongside the espresso mascarpone waiting on the sides of the plate dusted with the 5 spice crumble. This will pick you up if you didn't get the coffee already!   I would love to come back here again!! There is more to try like the Grand Prix, 13mi, and Lemon Drop! This is an appealing hang out place to eat, chat and sip on coffee!

Such an unfortunate experience this time around. Met up with a friend for lunch where this was her first time. I raved about how delicious this place is and how it's always busy!   We each ordered the 13 mile vegetarian crepe and I also ordered the butter toast. When I ordered the toast she said they only have marmalade - which to me is fine because it comes with marmalade. It wasn't until I was given the toast that it looked like it was missing the cultured cream. Now I see what was missing! Well...the toast definitely didn't taste as good as it should because it was missing the coolness of the cream.   Prior to receiving the toast we were given a kale bite salad to munch on. This was a lift bite. We were also given fried cauliflower bites.  Looking around the place a customer before received his plate and so we were soon to get ours. After another 15 minutes or so we noticed tray we still have not received our plates. Tables around who came after us received theirs too!! What the hay?! We inquired about our plates and one of the workers told us it was on its way. Another 10 minutes go by and still no plate. My friend went up to the cashier to ask about it again and they said it was on its way. The to-go order of the dessert crepe from my friend came. But still no 13 mile vegetarian crepe!!! Veggies should not be taking this long to cook!!   Almost an hour wait from the time of ordering the server came to our table with 2 to-go boxes! She asked if we would like to eat it here or have it to go. The whole point was to eat it while it's lunch time! Not sure if they confused my friends to go dessert crepe with the rest of the order especially when they brought my toast as a dine in plate. We said we will have a plate. We essentially had to plate the meals ourselves which was kinda weird. The server apologized for the mishap. Unfortunately I ended up only eating half of the crepe and re-boxed it because the whole experience of waiting almost an hour just shut down my appetite.    Also, this place is busy but not busy enough because a line was not forming and it was closer towards closing. A table of 4 behind us (who also came after us) also had 2 orders of the same dang plates! The servers gave away our plates!! No bueno!!   We walked away smelling like we have been the ones cooking in the kitchen all day. I felt bad for my friend because I told her this place was such as awesome place but I don't know if she would agree. What a bummer. Although the food is great the service for this time around definitely lacked. :/ Probably an off day?

Looking for a quick dinner I ventured to try a sandwich place. It was recommended to go there in which I've been hesitant to go but in surprise it was actually good! For a first timer I immediately ordered the seasonal special: gyro! You pick a paper sandwich bag that coordinates to your sandwich and mark any listed special requests on the bag.  Varies from bread type, meats, sauces, veggies, etc. For shakes and cookies you mark a different card. Pay at the cash register to the nice worker. My authentic gyro was around $8. I never knew crinkled French fries work well in a gyro! Great comfort food. The paper sandwich bag was hung up at the line with a pin sturdy enough to hold the wich.  Write your name on the bag so they can call your name when the order is ready.  The cookie was warmed up on the open toaster and nicely warm for the winter that's soon to arrive. Oozing chocolate came at each bite. Yum!  They have a loyalty program card. For every 10 sandwiches bought you get one sandwich free! Eat up!

What an interesting piggy place!! Haha / I mean that in a food sense and not in a selfish sense.   Anyway, the giant branded P&P pig on the wall just jumps out when you walk in.  The staff wore shirts with the phrase "Chicks dig the belly." Pretty funny! Friendly staff. TVs near to watch sports.    Then comes the food. :)  Starters: pork belly, chick pea pancake, Harissa, blue cheese n fig.  -This was a great combination put together. The pork belly was good but I've had ones that was more prepared to melt in the mouth.   Soup & Salad: golden beets, watercress, frisée, blue cheese crema, candied pecans, pomegranate, grape molasses with a side of pork belly. - Yummy in my tummy! This gives a balance of light but filling plate.   The Big Show: grilled hangar steak with fingerling potatoes, spinach, pickled beech mushrooms, chimichurri sauce  - Made medium well. Slight red. A little tough but probably don't wanna send it back just in case - ya know?   Sammies: smoked pot roast, caramelized onions, havarti, horseradish cream on white  hoagie bread with side of dump truck fries - Pot roast tasted like any other pot roast. Some pieces were moist. Others were dry. Caramelized onions are always a must. The fries were like any other fries too. Overall content. :)   Sweets: chocolate pecan pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - This is new for me and a win. Delighted with "new."   On the way out I just noticed a cute little piggy bank sitting on an entrance barrel. (Don't know how I missed that. Oh yeah- the gigantic P&P pig on the wall!!). Almost wanted to take it but of course I won't!   A place to enjoy pork belly!! ;)

Nori = seaweed. As a child I remember eating nori as a snack and to this day still love it. It's kind of funny seeing it evolve and have become the healthy form of chips and even sold in Costco. Eating nori solo is an acquired taste for some. Anyway, nori is what you see in your sushi, the part that wraps the main ingredients, just inside of the rice layer.   Going for family style for a table of 5 we chose the following: Cold and raw sashimi:  - Toro (tuna belly) - 5 pieces of sashimi. This is my favorite because it's a firm piece of the tuna belly yet melts in your mouth. You almost have to savor the bite or bites while eating it. When these types of fish are bought in a bidding war at the fish market they are well worth the battle. $28.  - Tako (Octopus) - 6 slices of octopus tentacle with lemon slivers. This probably is not my favorite because it was just too chewy. The penetrating white color against the yellow lemon looked nice on the bed of ice. $12 - Ika (Squid) - a mini bowl filled with squid decorated with masago (those tiny little orange fish eggs). These were better tasting than the octopus by far and were more edible to chew. $5  Cooked and warm sushi: - 2 Vegas rolls - this puts the American spin in 2 ways: the cream cheese and the fact that it's fried. This also has eel, salmon (I think) imitation crab, asparagus. If not salmon, then the imitation crab replaced it. And if not asparagus then some places use cucumber. Then the batter on the outside with some eel sauce.  - Shrimp Tempura Roll - another fried favorite. Shrimp tempura with imitation crab and asparagus. $10 - Soft Shell Crab Roll - fried soft shell crab with the same contents of the shrimp tempura. $13  Noodle dish:  - yakisoba - stir fried Japanese soba noodles with shrimp, red and green bell peppers, onions. A favorite noodle dish that anyone would love. $14  Then we decided to eat more.  So we ordered a handful of nigiri raw fish on a little mound of rice.  - Tuna (maguro) = red color fish which is the basic of all fishes. It is firm in texture and robust in taste. $6 - Salmon - light peachy color with some white. This is your omega 3 fish!! Semi-soft in texture and a mild soft taste. $6 - Yellowtail (hamachi) - light white with hints of red flesh. This is considered an oily texture and intense in flavor. $6 - Mackerel (Saba) - silvery-shiny fish that is delicate and flakey in texture and salty, cured in taste. $5 - Sweet Egg (tamago) - an egg cooked to a sweetness in a rectangular form. $5  - Salmon egg (Ikura) - large translucent dark orange salmon eggs toppled into nori and glazed over rice. Light bubble in texture and salty in taste. $5 - Fresh Water Eel (unagi) - Soft fish with a sweet taste because of the eel sauce made of soy sauce, rice wine and sugar. $6  There were a couple Kirin Lite and a large sake to show the spirit of the American way: Sake Bomber.   The waitress and the owner/manager, as well as the bus boy were all spectacular in service. Our waitress always had a smile and was helpful. The owner/manager was also helpful and professional to our table. The bus boy did his best to fill waters attentively. Nori hit the spot for a Friday evening!

Starting a work out after slowly somewhat in a recovery process from a back injury these small movements but yet powerful moves really make you shake, sweat and tone like you never would have imagined!! Well - at least for me.   My first visit was when I came in to ask about the classes over a month ago and even met the owner - who was really sweet and energetic! This franchise is next to the Organic Sip store which is fitting after a good workout! Schedules and info about Pure Barre is available outside of the Pure Barre entrance.   I started with the $100 one month unlimited new client special after going to a promo with Real Simple over the weekend. First of all the instructors and staff are energetic and friendly. The first three instructors, Sara, Lauren, Brianna (hopefully I got all their names correctly) all introduced themselves to me and to other new students - which is a real approachable way to make a newbie like me feel welcomed! :) i prefaced them with my back issues and each instructor all made sure to correct me and others in the class with the correct postures. Each class has been fun and all vary in exercise poses, and really hone in on the hard-to-get areas. So far the classes seem very promising especially if you're shaking like crazy!   The exercise room is carpeted with 2 mirrored walls and a bar around 4 walls. Bring a towel if you're a sweaty type of person like myself, a bottle of water, socks and dress in yoga capris or pants and a tank. A small red ball, stretch bands and mat will be provided during class. Don't worry - the mats do get cleaned after each use at the end of class.    I can't wait for the next class and for a month of a fun workout! Give it a try and you will be hooked! :)

Came here for happy hour and enjoyed the daily bruschetta (which had some pork butter that was very awesome and savory to the point where I would take the corners/pieces of the bread that had no pork butter and dip it back on the plate for the fallen drips of pork butter!), funghi pizza with various roasted mushrooms, pecorino cheese and mozzarella and sauce, and the BB&T cocktail out on the patio. The waiter was a very happy-go-lucky and hilarious guy! Had a great time and will come back again!

Came here twice in one week! These are thin crust pizzas made to your liking. You can also choose one of their creations. I chose a combo of their creations with my own twist. Start with the garlic butter and then he Pesto chicken creation with onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, olives, artichoke hearts, peppers and viola! Tastes so delicious! You can also pair it with a salad too!  Lunch time gets packed. Dinner time varies. Could have been more efficient in their assigning of workers so the wait time for pizza assembly could have been reduced.

Good place for late night cappuccino and to hang out. Patio out in the front. Entertaining to see a guy being "booted out" because it looked like he was over his drinking limit. Things that make you go hmmmm....;)

I never knew this place was right across the Postino's and LGO!! How I got here was due to eating at a sister restaurant, Chelsea's Kitchen. I received a certificate to dine in and I finally made it a point to come in for a bite or two. Today I came in for a super late lunch - at 4:30pm-  or you could call it an early dinner. Parking lot was a bit sparse but so is the rest of the other restaurants' parking. (Would be such a pain but luckily we came at such an odd time!)   I accidentally walked in the employee door where the staff forgave me and allowed me to enter. Otherwise, you should enter at the front double doors facing the street.  There are tables outside with heat lamps and then an inside bar that can seat about 16ish or so. 4 of us chose to sit inside since it was bitter cold outside. The area was shaped in a circular shape so that patrons can view the chefs. 2 chefs were working behind the somewhat covered kitchen while a couple staff members (maybe one was the owner) took orders and held the fort indoors.   The menu was limited as the space. Everything is a la carte style. I started off with drip coffee with cream and sugar to fend off the cold weather. Then I tried the freshly cut and cooked seasoned potato chips with skin-on with a sour cream-like sauce on top. Chomp chomp! Then I tried the Ingo's Cheeseburger made with grass fed beef, black creek cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo, dill pickle in between soft brioche bread. They cook their patties medium pink but of course you may choose to alter the making of that. This was quite juicy and delicious. The "No.1 Tuna Burger" was a tuna party, lettuce, avocado and a Siracha-mayo sauce (to give it the kick) in between a pillowy brioche bread. This actually seemed like a No.2 burger compared  to the Ingo's Cheeseburger just because it didn't seem as flavorful although both were juicy.   I was getting quite full but had to get something sweet so ordered a couple sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Found out that those were complimentary! Yummy for a Cookie Monsterish chick like me. My eyes became not full but my stomach was.  I ate 2 small cookies with the rest of my coffee.   The server was energetic and always checked how we were doing. Overall I enjoyed the freshly made meals and the comp cookies. I also saw that they make fresh juices too! I'll have to give that a try for next time! They have happy hour drinks from 11am to 7pm weekdays. Cheers!

For the most part the times that I have come here I have had good experiences.  There was only one time where the potatoes were undercooked and then this recent time that they didn't have mussels!   The know: This place is high prime time during dinner time on the weekends with wait times up to a couple hours!! If that's the case they will take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready. If you come during lunch then you are better off with no wait time. You get a bib while eating and yours to keep. ;) a bucket to dump the shells.   The Area: Picnic benches and tables are out on the patio area with misters during the hot season. Inside has graffiti walls and seats for you and your guests to write your mark that you were there. TVs are along the walls to watch the sports that's going on. When it's someone ones birthday they ring a bell and announce for the entire restaurant to hear.   The Food: For a table of 2 I recommend getting a pound of snow crab legs (around $16)  and a pound of mussels ($14) both with the trifecta sauces (garlic, lemon pepper and Cajun) and mild spice. They have a new sauce, coconut curry which is a bit spicy. Then add 2-4 small red potatoes ($0.50 each) and a couple 1/3 - 1/2 sized corn ($1 each). A little rip off on the corn and potatoes but still worth the eat with the sauce and just a good combo meal with the seafood. Sweet potato fries ($4) are a good "health" food to add if you are still hungry or need options other than seafood.   The Food (part 2): haha! I had to add this for separating my usuals and the other parts of the menu. Along with the main course of seafood (clams, king crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, blue crab, etc.) you can always get some fried foods like the po boy sandwiches, alligator, frog legs, and fries.   The Price: Seafood prices vary during the seasons. Prices above indicate summer prices. The food is reasonably priced.   The verdict: 4 out of 5 stars. Great casual place for a couple or for a group. Good for sports watching. A place to pig out on seafood and to get messy. So pull your hair back ladies and put out all 10 fingers men and chow down.

Fox concepts restaurant. Made a reservation ahead of time for a late brunch. Wait time was about 30 minutes. The look and feel of the place had elements of an office and other unique pieces.   Servers were dressed in a light pink button up shirt, striped ties, vertical striped aprons; and the men seem to be wearing oxfords to complement the look. Spiffy. I asked Seth, our server, to do a run through of the menu of the favorites.   Some of the breakfast/brunch favorites are the quinoa burrito, carrot cake pancake, chicken fried chicken,  smoked Norwegian salmon, roasted turkey french dip and CB and Rye. I opted to go for the Le Pig which had diced potatoes  and scrambled egg, ham and gruyere cheese squished between a pillowed toasted croissant. The chicken fried chicken had biscuit halves with fried breaded chicken on each and 2 sunny side up eggs with gravy sauce surrounding the set. Every bite of each plate was scrumptious.    I'm not a day drinker by any means but I had to try the Henry's Private Island drink made with some acai liquor and some acai juice and other juices. 1/3 of it was just enough for me!   Had to try bread pudding since I'm a huge fan of it! Vanilla bean ice cream scoop sat on top of the bread pudding with large golden raisins sprinkled throughout. Paired with the Cleo which is almond milk, hazelnut and espresso.   Super service from Seth and the staff. Seth was helpful, cheerful and had an amiable personality. I'm planning on coming back here to try the rest of the menu!!

Where is the 2nd Story Liquor Bar?! Ahh yes...up on the 2nd floor next to the Gelato Spot! Reserved for a table of 9 the hostess brought us upstairs to the 2nd floor where a huge chandelier hung above a table for 2. Booths and tables all around and a bar at the top. A server immediately asked if we have been here before and educated us of their drinks, as well as recommended a couple drinks. Good job. And then came back with waters.   This place has a few of the "weird" plates that the general crowd will not normally eat so I of course had to go for it!   Social Plates:  - Bone Marrow - this in hindsight is one of the peasant part of the cow...the throw away parts you throw as a treat for your dog - but is becoming the beginning attraction of the show. With a bit of decoration to liven the dish it becomes a beauty to devour. The bone marrow - which is high in fat- is eaten like a spread over some toasted buttered bread and garnished with some baby fennel dressed in red vinegarette, literally a couple micro cress, garlic-grape marmalade. The combination of everything jammed like jelly. $16.   Opening Fare: - Foie^2 - this is the cold strawberry-like pate and a little fatty sac atop the same rectangle buttered toasted bread, cranberries, barley smacks (which I didn't think go well with the dish) (there was no Brie and no winter squash and I received the white bread instead of the brioche).The dish was very odd as if they didn't have all the ingredients listed on the menu- but was at least presented and hidden well. $23  Dinner Fare: -Chicken Fried Brisket- a fried battered large square cube of the beef brisket was deep fried with a side of horseradish mashed potatoes, shallot gravy, baby white and yellow carrots and broccoli. I liked the presentation of this dish especially with the cubed fried brisket. $25  Sweet Side: -Banana Foster Bread Pudding - bread pudding with ice cream and coin pieces of banana $10  Cocktail:  - Corpse Reviver - a citrus like drink. $13  Too bad they were out of the bass and only had salmon. Overall the dinner was likable but a few ingredients were missing. Water was not there after the first glass was given. I give this a 3.5 stars but will bump it up due to half stars.

I have not seen the previous establishment but the new ownership did a great job with the new look and decor.  I sat in the comfy large booth and shared the Chopped salad (beautifully packed with colors of grilled chicken, diced cucumbers, sliced red bell peppers, bacon, mixed greens, corn, and pork bits) and the Pink Pony burger (website description: WI cheddar, crispy pork belly, avocado, garlic aioli, slow roasted tomato, bibb lettuce and butter bun - minus the fried egg) with fries. Too full for dessert. Since it was restaurant week they had a panna cotta dessert which is not on their regular menu. Asked if it was possible to sub that for their regular dessert and the waitress said they ran out and keep them for the restaurant week menu. What a bummer. I would have ate that one even when I was super full.   It would be nice to add that to their dessert menu as a regular.

The whole concept is similar to another pizza place I like however this one didn't do well in the department of putting ingredients on the pizza. Not sure if it's supposed to be like this or if the pool girl just didn't receive proper training.  I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. She barely put any sauce or cheese on the pizza nor did she put any chicken or basil. It was as if she was suffering an economic downturn by putting scraps of ingredients on the pizza. No good! Where did the ingredients go???  Unfortunately it was disappointing and starved of the actual main ingredients. :/

What and specifically where am I to eat in the Scottsdale area? Found it here - at the northwest corner of Rose and Scottsdale road! This is the new american cuisine to ease my curiosity of Paul Martin's style and techniques, and to ease my craving palate for different flavors. Oh the joys of summer has shineth upon us.   Our table was ready as expected with a reservation. Beginning beverage was the Raspberry Martini. House made infused raspberry vodka, lemon juice and sweet vermouth. Does indeed pass the sweet drink test! :)   Let's get straight to the food: Cedar Plank Salmon  - From the Classics. comes with shallots and bacon to give the powerful dominating flavors to best complement the cedar notes of the salmon, along with organic bloomsdale spinach, and crimini mushroom jus. This was a nice delicate dish to finish every last bite of.   Marinated Skirt Steak - thinly sliced with a pink center cut for the medium, with hearty mound of spinach on top.    Lemon Meyer Crème brulee - a seasonal dessert. Bits of lemon rinds in the crème brulee and 4 mini slices of lemon on top, and a couple biscuits. This is one of my many favorite desserts. I could just come back for this alone!   A phenomenal place for dinner, drinks and dessert.

Finally!! Some fun entertainment that we can rave about in AZ!!   Prepare yourselves with a golf glove instead of coming here on a whim (aka me) to avoid the possible blister on your thumb from gripping the golf club too tight. Came here before the 5pm rush for $35/hour. This place is great for groups. With your lifetime membership for $5 plus tax you can save every score that you ever made and check up on your scores. Waitresses/waiters will be at your bay to take your food/beverage orders. There are tv monitors if you really don't want to play golf too. Plushy couches to sit comfortably on for a party of 6. And there are misters to somewhat cool you off in the summer heat.   Immediately got a bay in less than 5 minutes. Took the top view and awfully attempted to score points based on accuracy but failed miserably. Let's just say I would not want to share my score. I just have to come back and practice more. Also played pool downstairs and virtual darts. This entire place is busy on the weekends. You don't have to be in golf attire. Comfy clothes like flip flops, tank and shorts are good enough.    Can't wait for the San Tan location to open up!!

Looking for something light and healthy, the crave was found here at the Original ChopShop Co., in the downtown part of Chandler. Menus were readily available at the front of the door on the table with various non-food merchandise to look at while waiting in line. Food items were available too. Tables and chairs were available inside and outside the establishment. 2 cash registers ready to take your order.   Choices from the Chops, grilled protein bowls, Breakfast, Superfruit Bowls, Parfaits, Between Bread, Protein Shakes, Pressed Juices and pastries.   The breakfast menu is available on extended hours on Saturday and Sunday 7am until 2pm instead of 12pm. I made it! :) The Zen Bowl included egg whites, spinach, sautéed onions, mushrooms and melted white cheddar over brown rice. Something very simple to make and delicious to eat. $6  Thai protein bowl included grilled chicken, broccoli, (found a brussel sprout), carrots, cauliflower, cilantro sprinkled peanuts, coconut curry sauce with a choice of brown rice, sweet potato hash, quinoa or forbidden rice. Forbidden rice was chosen for a bit of crunch bite to it. $9 + $1 for the forbidden rice  Muscle Malt - 24 oz protein shake filled with banana, chocolate whey protein powder, natural peanut butter, malt, sugar-free choco syrup and substituted with almond milk  $5.75 + $0.50 for almond milk. Thick and filling with great tastes of pb and chocolate!   A crafty and trendy place for the health goer. Many more visits to come!

Strobe lights and music outside upon arrival of the restaurant. That's a first! Happy and greeting staff when we first walked in the restaurant. Menus are colorful and loaded with pictures for each dish! Great job!   Miso soup and salad was provided prior to ordering! Awesome! Shared special combo 2 plate: #6 Palm Springs which included salmon rock 2 pieces (salmon with thinly sliced cooked onions and a yogurt sauce of some sort) spicy tuna roll 5 pieces and Fuji roll and eel roll. The eel pieces were a bit burnt as of there were no eel.  Grand opening special: thinly sliced apples with caramel drizzled on too with half orange cut up into chunks with whipped cream and 2 choc pretzel sticks. Yum!   Full at the end of dinner. Not bad!!  They all said goodbye with happy faces! That's how it's done! ;)

I was definitely in the mood for French cuisine and reserved a table for lunch. Tables began to fill half way into eating.  A bread and butter starter was given after taking orders.    Everything looked so appetizing and ended up selecting the Crispy Duck Hash. Very French I think. The dish was beautifully presented with the duck meat pieces hidden underneath the watercress salad, and potato squares ( the hash). Let the egg over easy yoke runnith over the hash and duck meat to soften some of the hash. Some pieces could have been cooked a little bit longer. The duck vinegarette enhanced the taste of each bite. I finished every bite til the plate was clean. The plate portion was just perfect for lunch.   Service was good and water pours were on par. If I come back to Vegas I would definitely try more items on the menu or the pre fixe menu. You can add bottomless mimosas, bellinis for $20 more, or Bloody Mary for $25 to your meal for brunch. Bon appetite!

A little dubious coming to small Chinese owned restaurants I was actually surprised by the authenticity of the Shanghai food here! Typical restaurants like these are not the best in decor nor ambience but probably closely resembles that of the crowded Los Angeles inner cities asian-owned restaurants.   We asked the cook for some recommendations and was recommended the following:  Cold dishes: - spongy tofu with peanuts. This is an acquired texture for those that are not so adventurous with foods. - Shanghai style cold simmered duck. Cooked like it was hot this is the cold version of it. Tastes the same but there is an inclination to the cold taste of cooked duck. You just have to try it for the sake of it.   Hot dishes: - fish filet noodle soup with pickled cabbage = this has a bit of spiciness. Simple noodles with the white fish fillets and pickled cabbage in a spicy-based broth.  - xiao long bao (steamed buns) = 8 pork filled soup dumplings encased with a thin bun wrap laid on a steamed cabbage to keep its moisture. Dip this in the soy sauce, vinegar and ginger sauce to give it the complete taste. One of my seeking foods to find and devour.  - capsella wonton soup = wow! This is quite delicious due to the translucent wonton with pork meat inside. With each bite the flavors burst throughout. These translucent wontons swim in the seaweed based soup with just enough seasonings to drink the whole bowl of soup - of one wanted to.   I would definitely come back for the capsella wontons and the xiao long bao. And of course, I'm down to try new dishes! Happy eating! :D

First visit review: Yummy! I have had this bookmarked for a while and finally ate here!! Yay! Choices of breakfast items, hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads and soups, Peixoto (local coffee) and pressed drinks from the chalkboard menu.   GRAZ Grilled Cheese:  - Green Goddess: ooey-gooey mozzarella cheese. Ripe avocado. Pesto. Fresh Spinach. An herb spread. All between a couple 9 grain buttered and grilled bread poked with a sandwich toothpick so that every bite gets a toasty crunch to it. With a pickle on the side. $8.35.  Paired with soup  - tomato bisque: chunky tomatoes. Turkey sausage andouille (I think). Cannoli beans. Kidney beans. And probably some other goods. A side of croutons. Very hearty filled wintery soup that I wouldn't mind eating by itself.  $3.25 if paired with a half or whole sandwich.   All in all I enjoyed the meal as I was overly content and wishing my stomach could try the pressed juices and take a coffee to go. :) would love to try the other items.   Owners/staff were great and helpful! Seating capacity looked to be about 15 count or so. Stool seats. A couple outside tables.   Open Monday-Friday 7am-6pm Saturday 7am-3pm.  Sunday closed. Would be nice to have Sundays open but everyone deserves a day off! :)

Raw Organic used to be Sip Organic - which the owner decided to take the reigns and part out on their own! Way to go for entrepreneurship! Anyway you will notice that all the names have changed but the ingredients are pretty much the same. Thank goodness they are here to stay!  My favorites are the First Date and the Nutty Monkey. Both are very similar except First Date has the good greens: spinach. Your folate, iron and fiber!! Oh yes...this is the one to boost your health!    First Date: greens, celery, rice milk, banana, dates, vanilla, maca, hemp seeds, almond butter.  I love a as a smoothie snack. Great flavor and enough greens. A way to feed your kids some greens maybe?? 16oz $7.75, 20oz $9.75.   Nutty Monkey: like the First Date but with no greens and no celery. This is considered a meal replacement. It's thick but I don't know if I can justify it as a meal replacement. Maybe a meal additional. 16oz $7.95, 20oz $9.95.   Many other options to choose from, as well as their fresh juices, acai bowls and elixirs. Love there colored chalk writing menus. Good staff and location.

Your server writing their name upside down on the paper "table cloth." Special bibs for all ages. Sports ready for the football games. Welcomes messy eaters. Paper tool box. All fun features for a good eating!  This marks the 3rd location of all the Angry Crab establishments - located in the same plaza as Starbucks. (3 down and one more to go). It's the Angry Crab and BBQ. Even though the BBQ part is "newer" addition to the original restaurant I was only looking forward to seafood!  Walked in through a mini hallway entrance to the hostess podium and the hostess walked a couple to their table. Waited for less than a minute and another host came out running to greet us and brought us to our table. One half of the restaurant was completely empty while the bar was slim and the west side of the restaurant was 80% full. All the booths were taken so we took at seat at the regular tables. Like the other 2 restaurants there was a washing station, TVs, paper "table cloths"   What to get??   ......BOLD signifies my faves........ Choose It: (by the pound) - MUSSELS. SNOW CRAB LEGS. Lobster. Dungeness crab. Shrimp. Crawfish. Clams. KING CRAB LEGS. Blue crab. Catfish. Salmon. Vegetables. $5-market  Sauce It: - Cajun. Lemon pepper. Garlic. TRIFECTA (all 3 prior). Traditional Boil. Pacific Rim (like a sweet coconut curry sauce). Sweet N Tangy (haven't tried)   Spice It:  - no spice. MILD. Medium. Hot. Angry Ghost. Scorching Scorpion. ( I never went beyond medium)  This time around our top picks for the day were King crab legs, mussels, shrimp, corn on the cobs (half sizes) $1 each. red potatoes ($0.50 each) all with the mild trifecta sauce, and an Angry Basket: fried soft shell crab that comes with seasoned fries $12.   Samson was our smiley and super server who perfected his name written upside down and gave us our "toolbox" on out paper table cloth. Love that! A+  Fried Soft shell crab breading was a bit much for me. Everything else was yummy! Mussels were of decent size at this location.    Overall 4 out of 5. Can't be angry with the Angry Crab.

Pretty good! Ahi tuna burger with tomatoes, cucumber lettuce, Siracha aioli, caramel soy sauce, avocado on a cute sesame toasted bun for $10. Perfectly shaped as if you didn't want to eat the nice presentation! Ordered regular sweet potato fries for $3.  Prepay at the register. Grab a number. Find a table and wait for order to come to your table. Pleasantly surprised with the taste of this combo. They even had about 10 different kinds of sauces such as Thai ketchup and chipotle mayo. Variety is key!! Inside seating was blasting cold air. Too cold for me. Optional outside seating was great for some fresh air for this time of year.  The only horrific experience was when I left I ran my hand through my hair while driving to my next destination, and something weird was in my hair. Some crustationlike texture. Then some legs of some sort. And then as I was driving I see some weird bug!!!! Ughhhhh!! Screamed and drove to the nearest parking area as the bug ended up crawling from my waist seatbelt. Parked and ran out of the car and brushed that creepy weird looking bug off of me!! What a relief. Outside seating gave me an unwanted friend.  Lol....despite that bug scare (meant for a bug's adventure elsewhere), I did enjoy the presentation of the burger and fries and loved the taste. Will be back soon to try more and the shakes.

Pay show tow  = Peixoto. That's how you pronounce the family name who discovered this Brazilian coffee family business! And I'm glad they continued the local art of coffee!   The gentleman behind the counter was very very knowledgable with each drink listed on the menu for each one that I asked as they were unique than the usual corporate coffee makers.  The entire area of seatings all were unique pieces and varied with a couple cozy couches, small coffee tables, large picnic like table and some high bar stools, etc. if I remember correctly. The Lighting was great during the day time.   Their peppermint chocolate mocha was absolutely delicious and topped with their house made marshmallows, a sprig of fresh mint and a heart designed by the barista!! This dreamy beverage will capture your heart and soul!!   Knowledgable and family-like staff and nice atmosphere to lounge around. Have to try the rest of the menu for the new year!

Refreshing and balanced meal. This restaurant is about eating well and caters well to vegan, gluten free and vegetarian - which are none of me but I appreciate the variety. Sister restaurant of sumo maya, local bistro and central bistro.   Nature colors of sand, green and white filled the ambience. Natural looking plates and bowls.   Jambalaya - brown rice, turkey sausage, black beans, bell peppers topped with scallions and piquante sauce. This was a pack of flavor and a pinch of spice for a filling dinner. $12  Karma juice is available in bottles to go. Smoothies are also available. I would come back to try their other plates and bowls and hand helds, along with the other items on their menu for breakfast!

First off I received a postcard mail for this new place. 50% off your entire dine-in meal. What a great deal! And if you make it to the first 50 customers for certain days then you get a $10 gift card. Too bad I wasn't one of those first 50.   When you walk through the doors a worker greeted each person and provided a menu. The menu is nicely done with pictures of each item, with descriptions and prices. It also shows available house-made sauces, house-made dressings and spice blends. Everything looked so appetizing! The decor was a fresh look of lime green and deep red. Tables and booths are plentiful.   Since I love variety I went for the 2 combo which is regularly $8.79 for a choice of 2 items: whole sandwich, half soup, or half salad. It comes with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry!!! Wow! That is a very nice complement to a meal and a rare complement for any meal that I've seen! This deserves a major star!! For the kiddos (10 years and younger) they also get a combo deal for a 2-choice of baked chicken strips, fruit cup, grilled cheese or small soup for $3.99. They even get a choice of bread or a chocolate dipped strawberry and small drink!! You lucky kids!!   If you're not into the combo deals you can always get whole sandwich, salad or soup for $5.49, $7.59 and $6.39 respectively. And halves of salad and soup for $5.59 and $4.39 respectively. And the great part is that you'll receive the fresh french baguette and the chocolate dipped strawberry!   There were at least 15 people ahead of us but Cafe Zupas did a phenomenal job in efficiently handling the line quickly! Probably took 7 minutes-ish. At the end of the line before you get to the register to pay they have a nice display of some desserts!! More deliciousness to add to the meal. This time around I passed on it but I foresee me getting one next time.   I ordered the combo of pesto chicken sandwich and the roasted red pepper and lobster soup.   Pesto chicken: had sliced almonds, roasted red peppers, muenster cheese, tomato and sprouts. This was a new kind of pesto sandwich for me because of the almonds. For me it was a bit too much almonds. Maybe it wasn't spread out evenly. The size of the sandwich was a bit smaller than most places hence the whole sandwich.   Roasted red pepper soup: "Rich and savory" it actually had real lobster meat! Yum! This had a little bit too much saltiness for my taste buds. If you're the type that seasons your dish with loads of salt or soy sauce then you might be okay with it. I dipped the bread to tone down the saltiness.   The chocolate dipped strawberry ended my meal with a sweet note.   The variety of the foods and the price points were pretty decent. I really enjoyed the complementary choc dipped strawberry. And the service for the grand opening days were pleasant.

Excellent trails and a popular one too! Start on the Telegraph Pass Trail for about 500 feet in elevation, 2.3 miles round trip. This is considered an easy hike even for your kiddos. First quarter of the mile is paved and then the rest is some rubble terrain.   If you're feeling like hiking more, then you should prepare for some water. You'll need a minimum of 50 fl oz to barely be good in the sweltering heat and no clouds in sight. And you'll want to take some salty and sweet bars, trail mix or the like.   If you continue on you can take the National Trail West and the Kiwanis Trail. This one has plenty inclines and declines that makes a round to the Telegraph Pass Trail. You can also mountain bike here too! You will easily trek about 8 miles here.   Ample parking lot, a picnic table in the center and a water fountain.

Having only been to the Mesa location it was time to try their sister location. This location I heard from fellow locals said this location has been overturned around 6 or 7 times.  But I think this one is here to stay.   There were the usual graffiti walls, booths, bibs, tvs, a and then the weird part - high top tables. The one the hostess seated us was at was a wobbly high table. And then there was a section that was empty due to no server available. Then I spotted a booth that was almost done eating. I asked the hostess if I could take that since they were done. And she said that other people were waiting 20 minutes for it and would need to go on the waiting list. I look around me and there were plenty seats available. Not sure what she is talking about. We decided to sit at the bar facing the 4 tvs puzzled to one.   Glad we sat at the bar. Great view of the tv and center spot. Bartender was good and told us about the new items on the menu from the other location. New items: bbq meats, catfish, veggies $5, salmon with veggies $16.   Went for the usual trifecta mild sauce with snow crab legs. The best!! Always pair it with corn $1 and potato $0.50 each. Tried the clams - which was okay because these were the heavy shells and tiny meat. Skip on this. Also tried the salmon with the lemon pepper sauce. Sauce was good with the veggies but bland on the salmon. Use the trifecta sauce for the salmon. Veggies included bok choy, squash, mushroom, fall veggies. I'd say the veggies were well over cooked.   The couple sitting next to us were a fun couple to talk to. And btw, the bar seating was now full. When someone orders a spicy level of 6 the staff yells and announces it to everyone. Same with birthdays. A slice of dessert like double chocolate cake or red velvet cheesecake or root beer float to name a few is given to the one turning a year older.

A new place for brunch. Driving here was an unknown because you're in the historic part of the area and it looks like a neighborhood area. Just past the roundabout you'll reach a small parking in the back and more parking across the street.   We came in through the back door. The way to work this is order your food and pay first. There are tables inside, 3 outside in the front and plenty in the back. Water jug with cups are near the cashier.   For one cook, I think, the food took longer than usual but for the now part it was worth the wait.   Breakfast: savory crepe. Delicious creamy. Filled with cooked veggies like arugula, portobello, artichokes in a creamy mushroom sauce. $7.50   Lunch: The sandwich is made your way. You choose the meat, cheese, sauce, and any extras. Chose: Short rib, smoked gruyere cheese on an open faced one slice bread, with romaine lettuce, a side of red pepper sauce. Presentation on this was simple as well as the overall sandwich itself. $9.   Server: a put together server who offered to move the umbrella to block the sun. Thanks! Surprise dessert and a candle lit up twice by the same server.   Would come back again to try the other dishes.
