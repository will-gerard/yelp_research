Great friendly front office staff. I had to wait 20 min for my appointment but that is normal at a doctors office.  Dr. Shay was great and very easy to talk too. Someone did walk into the room during my exam which was discomforting but pretty impress with their office overall

NOT bad! A bit pricey and they ran out of ribs right before we ordered but we got the ranch burger and it was sure filling! I recommend trying this place sometime!

Great down to earth people, not intimidating but they will still kick your butt into shape! I've lost 12 lbs already! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is ready to be healthy again!

So much for Sunday Funday the waitresses are more interested in the guys then taking care of you
