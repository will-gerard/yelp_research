I love the atmosphere at the Farm (when it's not too hot) and the food is pretty darn good every time I've gone.  The downsides are it's a little pricy and gets pretty crowded when it's nice out.

Went for dinner and the food was delicious! We tried the yami roll, caterpillar roll, and tempura udon - everything was great. Fresh ingredients and flavorful.  Ambiance was nothing special, no music, but the place was clean.

This is my sister's restaurant, so I am a little biased but the food is great and the owners are great!!! :) I recommend the wings, Gyro, turkey BLT, or cheese steak.  I also love the zucchini sticks.

Would give this place zero or negative stars if possible.  Service was awful, drinks were mediocre and they don't tell you that they charge "for seating".  So we ended up paying a lot of money for a very negative experience.

My favorite brunch place in Ahwatukee. Food is consistently very good.

Chopped salad is amazing but bananas foster French toast is excessively drenched in syrup and butter, and served with syrup and butter on the side!! Environment is great.

We took Whiskey, our recently rescued dog, to Dr. Oetke for a check up, vaccines, and treatment for an allergic reaction and ear infection.  The team at Animal House was wonderful! They were great with Whiskey, attentive to his conditions, thoroughly answered all of our questions, and took the time to show us how to properly clean his ear and apply the medication.  We would highly recommend this clinic.
