I really love places like this. Actually I love pretty much any coffee shop that is not Starbucks. After reading a few reviews on Yelp, I decided it was time to try the Mexican Mocha.  Oh.... Mexican Mocha. How I love thee.  I love you iced. I love you hot. And I love you blended.  This is easily the best coffee drink I have had in Arizona.  I'm sure there other coffee drinks are delicious, and maybe if they run out of Mexican Mocha I will try one. But for now I'm hooked.  It is a perfect blend of coffee and spicy chocolate flavor.  Jolta Java is also a super comfy caf√©,  the salads and sandwiches are delish, and the staff is super friendly.  I also just signed up for their frequent customer program, and it's great that they use your phone # as your ID instead of having to carry yet another card on my key ring.  Do yourself a favor, drive past Starbucks tomorrow morning and support a local business. You won't be sorry.

I only went to one bakery to taste for my wedding cake - my new hubs actually is not a cake fan so I knew I had to be selective as I really wanted him to come and I knew he wouldn't make it to more then one tasting so I had to nail it!   I selected Honeymoon Sweets because I knew that Whole Foods offered their desserts, and Whole Foods and I are good friends and I trust his opinion. There are some poor reviews out there, but we decided to roll the dice and wow was I glad that we did.   We had nothing but great service from them - the phone service was a little sketchy like they were multi-tasking while talking to me, but really I can't fault them because I do the very same thing at work. What matters is that they nailed our cake. I actually came in with a sketch of how I wanted my cake to look, which is I think kind of a risky proposition versus going with a tried and true design. The sales lady checked with the cake designer and they said they could do my design, and best of all, with just buttercream frosting to support the design, which is great because fondant is nasty and $$$. So we tasted all the flavors and decided on lemon cake with raspberry mousse (yum) and chocolate cake with coconut cream (double yum). I actually changed the chocolate flavor to red velvet a few weeks before the wedding because unbeknownst to me a lot of people don't like coconut, and the red velvet was a total hit.   So how did the design turn out??? ( I will post a photo). AMAZING. I was so nervous as I arrived at the venue and we were taking pictures my thoughts kept drifting over to the cake. I was a little freaked out thinking how it would look, again, only because of the few negative reviews, not because of anything I experienced. So finally I grew some cajones and went to look at the cake. Holy cow it was awesome. It was better then I imagined. After a few friends posted pics on facebook tons of people commented on how cool the cake was.   So huge high five to Honey Moon Sweets. We did not have a cake with our package so we had a choice, and we are glad we chose you. The cake vendor is one you don't get to see or thank at your wedding, so I want to thank your staff and your cake designer for knocking this one out of the park!

Forget the lettuce for my to go lettuce wraps once, shame on you. Forget them twice, shame on me. The third time and Pei Wei is officially dead to me. Awful service and I was promised a credit for my jacked up un-lettuce wraps that has yet to happen. And I tried to call. Three times. And all three times some airhead hung up on me. Unacceptable. Stay away!

So I got married downtown at the Icehouse last month - prior to that I have to say I had actually visited downtown Phoenix zero times.  I live in Scottsdale/PV so never thought there was a reason to go "downtown".  Boy was I wrong.     While vetting out a location for our rehearsal dinner we dined at a few cool spots downtown, one of which was Cibo. Coming from Chicago I consider myself a pizza snob/aficionado so it takes a little bit to impress me.  I was drooling over Cibo's menu before we even arrived, and they did not disappoint.  First of all, the restaurant and patio are just freaking adorable. I had no idea Phoenix offered neighborhoods such as the one Cibo is located in. Rows of cute bungalow homes just like back home! And located in one on the corner, there is Cibo!  What a romantic, special setting.    On my first visit, the server was knowledgeable about the menu, ingredients, as well as the vino.  I like that they use local and organic ingredients mixed with authentic Italian items that are imported and impossible to duplicate.  We started with the Ostia salad which I am now obsessed with and have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate at home.  The chickpea dressing was so well balanced, and the crispy parsnips on top were such a creative was to add crunch.  We ordered both a red and a white pizza, because we just couldnt decide. The pizza crust was just the right mix of crunch and chew, and the toppings and cheese were fresh and flavorful.  Ahhhhh and the Nutella Crepes. So simple yet so divine. Warm crepes stuffed with Nutella with a scoop of ice cream. Hard to find anything wrong with that.  So midway through my 3rd glass of vino the decision was made - we were going to host our wedding rehearsal dinner here.  We asked them to show us the location, which could not have been more perfect. Private parties can be hosted in what is basically a guest house converted into a party room. It was just too cute for words, needed little decoration, and has a bar, private bathroom, and a great patio. They told us they were planning to host small weddings in the space as well.  The service that I received with regard to our rehearsal was great. Michelle was quick to respond to my questions and I really appreciated her guidance on the menu as we had a few vegan/vegetarians in our party.   The value of hosting our dinner there was fantastic.  Our $20/pp package included house salads, a trio of bruschetta choices, a variety of pizzas, and those Nutella crepes I had been dreaming about.   To keep costs in check we decided to serve soft drinks and a selection of a couple of beers and wines for our guests to chose from . All in all, with gratuity and drinks included the bill was around $1000 for about 30 people, which I felt was a great value. The bartender and wait staff made sure everyones waters and drinks were full, and the timing of the service was great.   Our friends and family raved about the location and food, and had a blast enjoying the beautiful evening weather on the private patio.  Cibo will always hold great memories of a fantastic night with friends and family, and I look forward to my next visit to this little treasure. I have yet to go to Bianco despite all I have read, but honestly would have a hard time justifying waiting in line and dealing with all the hoopla involved with dining there when I know Cibo is around the corner and well deserving of my business.

OMG the pina colada. I have quite a bit of experience with Rum, and the pina colada at Breadfruit is the most balanced and delicious rum drink I have ever tasted. The fresh flavor with just the right amount of sweetness will make you completely rethink your perception of what is typically a sugary frozen concoction served with an umbrella.    Vibe was downtown cool with fun jamaican beats playing .Our service was excellent, so as far as the negative service reviews, either they have gotten it together or we dined on an "on" night. Our server was knowledgeable and made great recommendations, even suggesting drink pairings to complement out entrees.  The scallop appetizer was yummy - a little on the small side with 2 scallops so dont plan to share if there are more then 2 at the table. The jerk seasoning was yummy and had a great kick. I had the prawn curry and really enjoyed the entire dish - a generous helping of prawns with sauteed veggies and perfectly cooked rice and peas (again, many have complained about the rice but it was cooked nicely).  Our server suggested a mojito as a paring with the curry, and I took her suggestion. i get nervous ordering mojitos because some bartenders use mint syrup vs fresh mint, which is totally nasty, and many tend to over sweeten the drink. Not the case here. Again - perfect balance between tart and sweet and the best mojito I have had outside of my secret recipe!  For dessert there was a deep internal struggle between ordering the sweet potato pudding and enjoying another pina colada.  Since I was the driver the puddin won out. It was a unique dessert - not very sweet and nicely complimented by whipped cream flavored with even more rum.   I read a few poor reviews for the size of the desserts - OK people this is not the Claim Jumper.  The size was perfect for sharing and a completely appropriate size for a dessert.  If you want a ginormus hunk of cake you can go to Chilis or Claim Jumper and enjoy the side of diabetes. Seriously what is wrong with America. Soapbox.  All in all an amazing experience, and will definitely be back. Bill was about 90 for 2 of us, the food was very reasonable but with 2 cocktails each there was no way we were getting out of there under a hundy, That being said, the quality, flavor, and service made it more then worth it.

I found Karve on Yelp after doing research into Ballet Barre / Berk Method workouts.  Due to a few back injuries, this workout suited my need of an effective, low impact toning workout that would strengthen my core and back.      Now let me start out by saying I had never been to a group exercise class.  Classes freak me out.  My tendency to trip and fall for no apparent reason and overall lack of coordination had up until this point prevented me from setting foot into any environment with potential for embarrassment.     I turned 30 last year and am obsessed with stopping the hands of time both externally and internally.   I had set a goal for myself of getting a six pack by 2011.  Hell I would even take a four pack.  It was time to man up.    So I pulled the trigger on Karve, signing up for a  "Karve Basics" class. Like a good little student, I arrived 15 minutes early and filled out the needed paper work.  That night's teacher was Casey, who I affectionately refer to as "Throw up lady".  This nickname is a result only of what I did when I got home from my first class, it has nothing to do with Casey personally, whose classes I have come to enjoy.  Other then the projectile vomiting and nearly falling down the stairs after class due to my legs shaking violently, I loved it.  She ran through a few of the moves we do in class, and a nice stretch, class began with a few minutes of marching in place coupled with different arm movements to warm up.  For the next hour we did arm work, planks and pushups, ballet inspired stretches at the bar, thigh and the dreaded seat work, and the most intense as well designed ab workout I had ever done.  When the lights were turned off at the end of the class and we cooled down with some yoga poses and stretches, I felt both misery and bliss at the thought of it ending.    I now am a loyal "auto pay unlimited month" client and have been going for about 6 months, and am so glad I found a workout I love and am committed to for the long run.  I'm sure many of you reading this are debating giving it a shot, and I urge you to do so.  But I also feel it is my duty to bring you up to speed on a few things that I wish I knew , because I want everyone to enjoy Karve as much as I do.    So #1, Karve Basics is NOT an introductory class. All "basics" means is that the focus is on holding the correct form. I actually think it's harder because instead of transitioning moves every 10 seconds or so, you hold them for 20 plus seconds. Brutal.    #2 Don't expect a miracle.  I thought within 3 months of 3-4 classes a week I would look like Gisele in a bikini.  Not so much.  After 6 months I am almost at my goal, so I think 6-9 months of consistent classes will have most people in pretty decent shape.    #3 It takes about 5-10 classes to feel like you are doing all the moves correctly.  What's great about Karve is no one judges you because we have all been there, so if you can't complete a pose or drop to your knees on pushups, no worries. When you get it right, it feels amazing.    #4 Another reviewer on here commented on only wanting to go to Alli's class, because compared to other instructors she seems the most encouraging.  I have to agree, but don't make that an excuse to not go.  If you need help, any of these lovely ladies will go above and beyond.  But Alli overall is the most patient with newbies and I enjoy her class immensely.  I think Tara, Michelle, and Danielle are also good choices for your first class, they will take time to show you how to modify moves if you have an injury or are new to Karve.  Casey is a great teacher and is very creative. She just got a bad rep around my house because of the projectile vomiting I mentioned earlier, but she is awesome and her class is always a challenge.  I pretty much only can attend the 7PM classes or weekends, so I can't really speak about the daytime teachers.  Kendra is the owner, and I've only been able to go to her class once or twice, but she is so graceful to watch you can't help but want to stick it out so you can look like look like her! Gina is like a damn drill sergeant. No joke her class is hard and she moves quickly.  Her class is a challenge for seasoned Karve students (a good thing), but I personally can't say I would send a friend to her for their first class.  One Saturday she taught Karve Basics, and I watched a girl there for the first time practically break into tears of frustration trying to keep up with the quick pace.  I felt compelled to say hi to her after class and tell her it's not always like that, and I hoped she would come back.  Let's just say we never saw her again.   This is MY opinion, all the teachers are great in their own ways and you need to find the ones that suit you. But DON'T let a teacher you don't jive with be your excuse not to get your butt in there!  So thanks Karve - you've done me right and I look foward to a long friendship! If you are thinking about trying it, do it!

If you are considering chiropractic as part of your health care routine, I highly recommend meeting with Dr. Steve Hruby.  Having previous spine/back injuries I had seen other chiropractors regularly in the past with mixed results  but after 5 years as a patient I have never felt better then I do under Dr. Steve's care.   Dr. Steve is thorough and caring and takes a genuine interest in each and every one of his patients. His adjustments are as good as they come and he offers the best technology available to support his manual adjustments.  I also have taken advantage of the other wellness services offered at Kai-Zen, including acupuncture, stretch therapy, and massage.  Annette the acupuncturist is the absolute best and her treatments have helped me to nearly eliminate allergies and several other medical concerns.   The Kai-Zen team treats you like family while providing an exceptional level of professional care. Appointments are easy and the hours are very flexible!

OK, realllllly did not want to write a poor review of this place.  I even thought about it for week before I did, but they have done themselves in here! My honey and I went last Saturday for "happy hour".  I love tapas and haven't been able to find a great spot since Sol y Sombra shut down, so we thought we would give them a try.  It was a beautiful evening, and they offer a 2-4-1 happy hour on the patio or in the bar.     So we spent two hours enjoying their delicious tapas, wine, sangria, and even dessert and coffee.  Food and drink were both amazing, and the service was attentive and gracious.  Sadly, thats as glowing as this review is gonna get because they have royally pissed me off.   Where they really went wrong was with what happened after.  So we got our "happy hour" tab, signed the receipt, and left.  I have to admit this was partially my fault because I tend to sign credit card slips with reckless abandon and utter disregard for the total(denial is not just a river in Egypt people), which was in this case, $93 plus a $20 tip.   So we get home, still talking about how delicious everything was, and I casually throw the receipt on the counter.  The sangria has now worn off.... $93? For happy hour? Yikes.  So apparently our server neglected to price our drinks out at happy hour pricing.  And the servings had been pretty small, even for tapas, certainly not the double portions that are supposed to arrive between 5 and 7.  So I called the restaurant immediately.  Having worked in restaurants before, I usually pick my battles, but since we had gone for happy hour intentionally based on what we read on Yelp, this called for attention.   SO I called the restaurant right away, and was apologized to profusely. Yes, I was correct, we had not received the happy hour portions that we should have ( which was probably why we ordered so many tapas) and we were charged double what we should have been for our drinks.  The sweet guy on the phone informed me that there was no manager available as it was a busy time on Saturday night, but that they would certainly make this right, and a manager would call me tomorrow.  Seemed reasonable so I gave them my number and waited.  Sunday, no call.  So Monday I called and left another messgae. Tuesday, still no call.  So I emailed them.    So a week later, no call, no email, nothing.  Like I said, I really don't want to give these guys a bad write up, but this is just about the worst customer service I have encoutered in a while. I personally will not return, despite a craving for their crab stuffed peppers.  If you want to chance it, go ahead, you will have a great time but will certainly pay for it!   It's really a shame because stuff like this is why otherwise great places seem to cycle in and out of this area way to fast.

Ummmm OK so what to say about Morgan Hope.... she is an amazing stylist, fun to be around, and you will never leave her chair feeling anything but hot! Morgan has taken me from blond to brunette, long to short, and curly to straight.    She does the absolute best hair extensions in town.  I had mine in for 6 months with only one touch up and they looked so great and natural, they even scored me a new boyfriend. She took the time to match my hair perfectly and was super careful with my fine hair.   Morgan has also treated my hair with a Brazilian Keratin treatment.  It made my hair so shiny and straight it was probably the healthiest it has ever looked.   She is so creative with color, so you can either show up with a picture and she will duplicate it or you can let her do her thing.  Most recently I let her color my blond hair reddish brown with a few hi-lights (totally unplanned) and no joke I have NEVER gotten more compliments on my hair.    Morgan is a blast to talk to and the time in the chair goes so fast! Steven Paul is also a great salon with a cute shop and cafe, so you can pratically spend the whole day there.

Figured it was time to update the Yelpiverse on how things are going with Morgan Hope!   She continues to WOW me every time I sit in her chair.   I highly recommend that if you are thinking about extensions, talk to Morgan!  She has done full extensions for me 3 times and each time they have lasted upwards of 6 months.  The hair she uses is such great quality and the way she matches color and blends the hair blows my mind.  I have really fine hair that breaks easily, but the technique she uses is very gentle and my hair is left in great condition when the extensions are removed.  Morgan did my extensions and also styled my entire wedding party for my big day. My bridesmaids all said they had never felt more beautiful and loved their unique styles. When my extensions lost a little bit of shine after me beating them up on my honeymoon, Morgan did a Brazilian Keratin treatment and literally brought my hair back to life! This is a great option if your hair needs some extra shine and smoothness.   I have slightly longer then shoulder length hair right now, and really wanted to give the gradual ombre trend a go. Since my hair is so fine, Morgan recommended adding a few light blond extensions to give the illusion of ombre instead of bleaching my hair.  This was one of the best suggestions I have ever received from a hairstylist!  I love it and she nailed the ombre!   If you need a change from your boring snooty hairdresser, give Morgan a try and you will have a blast and leave looking your best! Thanks Morgan!

A few weeks after our wedding and we are still getting rave reviews on not only the food, but the service provided by Copper Square Kitchen.   We tasted with Copper Square and one other caterer, and there was no comparison, and the other caterer's food gave me such a belly ache! If you want a simple chicken or beef choice, you can pretty much go to anyone (although I'm sure Copper Square rocks this out too) but if you want a truly unique meal that your guests will be talking about weeks later, go with these guys. At our tasting they really pulled out all the stops. Griselda (the Catering Manager I think is her title) is just so warm and accommodating and I felt like whatever we asked for, she would make it happen. Susie, the Head Server is also the bomb. She made me feel like a princess not only at the tasting but on the big day.  First the service - on my wedding night every time I turned around my champagne was topped off and my drink was filled. Susie even placed a plate of food at my seat, knowing that I would be rushed saying hello to everyone (she was right!).  Many of our guests commented on the high level of services from both the servers and bar staff - and the stiff pours were much appreciated by our guests (we provided the liquor which was a huge cost saver). Griselda was also there to make sure the night was a success.  I also want to mention that we used the Hyatt Downtown Phoenix(Copper Square is part of Hyatt)  as our hotel of choice for our guests and they were beyond thrilled with the service, location, and rooms in the hotel too. We received a complimentary wedding night room as part of our package, and Griselda gave us an amazing room for our first night as a married couple! We plan to come back to Hyatt to celebrate our anniversary in the future.  On to the food ... like I mentioned, we did not want the "chipper chicken" nor the "vale" (OK if you haven't seen Father of the Bride that makes no sense). We wanted a unique variety of flavors that would please all of our guests. We really wanted food stations to remove the wedding stuffiness. I have to tell you that the presentation of the food stations by Copper Square is the coolest I have seen at any event. They use really cool tables and unique set ups to make the food look appealing, which trust me it does pretty well on its own.   So here is what we selected:   We had the Dippin Station at cocktail hour, which I pretty much missed, all though I did pound a few bread cubes dipped in Spinach Dip while lining up for the reception, and it was really good!   The Sonoran Street Tacos: Tacos for wedding food? Yes please! Our guests freaking loved it! They served chicken, carne asada, and pork carnitas tacos with warm shells and the most amazing homemade salsas and guac for toppings. They were all delish, as I learned at the tasting. Mid way through wedding planning I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, poultry, and pork. Griselda immediately offered to check with the chef on subbing shrimp tacos which I thought was really sweet, but I stayed with the original 3 choices.   Sushi Station: So we originally were going to do the Bisbee mini Kobe burgers, which were amazing at the tasting. They were a casualty of my newfound pescatarianism, because, I should get to eat at my own wedding right? And we were originally serving a lot of red meat. I was glad I switched it to Sushi, which anyplace else would have been risky, but it was SO GOOD and gave our guests another variety of flavor to experience. The presentation was awesome and the fish was so fresh and just the right amount of heat.   Roasted Beef Tenderloin w/Cheddar Mashed: This was for my meat eating Chicago family. Again, it was so good when I had it at the tasting, and the guests said that it was so juicy and tender - one actually said it was the best meat he had ever had! I enjoyed a heaping pile of the mashed potatoes, and I'm pretty sure that they serve those in heaven.   Mac'n'Cheese bar: Presentation wise, this was the only slight miss by Copper Square (nobody's perfect) because I had requested they be served in Martini glasses, and put on my menus "Mac'n'Cheese Martini Bar" so the guests were probably wondering where the martinis were because they just had small plates, but no biggie. The cheese sauce was soooooooo good and I loved that there was also a vegan option of soy cheese and eggless noodles for the few vegans in the house. They offered chorizo, bacon, veggies, etc.. as toppings and this was the hit of the night!  All in all, a HUGE thank you to Copper Square and the entire team. I couldn't believe how they basically threw down a kitchen in the side alley and everything turned out 5 star A+++++. Griselda was an absolute doll and I hope we stay in touch, and we will see you all when we hit up the Hyatt for our anniversary (unless of course we can afford to go to Tahiti where we went for our honeymoon, yeah, prob not gonna happen!)

Went here for dinner with the hubby on a Friday night - it was really empty which is a bummer because the hotel this is located in as well as this restaurant space have changed owners/names/styles/etc... like 4 times in the 5 years I have lived in AZ. Sadly, this may be the destiny of Saguaro and Distrito as well.  The hotel is weird . This isn't a review of the hotel, but since you walk through it to get to the restaurant I thought I would mention how it really distracts from the fun decor and vibe of Distrito. The color scheme is just cheap looking, like they are trying too hard to be funky.  There is no comparison to Valley Ho so why bother trying.   Distrito - really what what a fun design. Very Nacho Libre without being to cheesy and/or featuring wrestling masks on the wall.  I liked the vibe it has the right noise level for a chill happy hour or dinner.  I want to address a few things I read in somewhat negative reviews here on Yelp.  Most of the negative remarks seem to stem from a complete misunderstanding of what small plates means.  Tapas/small plates are just that. Small plates of food. Our server was very clear on this, so I'm not getting why someone would complain about the portion size.  Our server recommended 2-3 dishes per person.  We ordered 7 items and ended up taking at least 2 home, so he was pretty dead on.  I get that its a little pricey, but its a restaurant in a hotel in Scottsdale, so if you didn't expect that you probably shouldn't be eating here. The quality was A++ and worth the price. Also, lots of moaning about slow service.  Tapas/small plates meals are meant to be savored, and such a great chance to try a varierty of flavors. The dishes were nicely spaced out, and all in all I think we spent about 1 hr 45 minutes there.  My only feedback as far as service is that the drinks came out super slow, but other then that our server was very attentive.  The drinks are bomb. I had a pineapple margarita that is probably top 3 margaritas I have ever had, and trust me this girl likes her tequila. $13 was a little steep, but again for a hotel restaurant not much of a surprise.  If they have a special on these for happy hour I could definitely toss more then a few back.   The food was delicious and flavorful.  We started with guac and the Octopus ceviche. Both were fresh and tasy, and the guac had just the right amount of heat. The ceviche was the only dish that I felt was shockingly small. Maybe 6-7 pieces the size of a large paperclip. I wanted more!   I ordered the mahi mahi tacos, which we street taco sized ( again, server descibed the size well as we ordered). The mahi was lightly fried and the baja sauce was so yummy. Since America is totally disenchanted about the size of an adequate meal, I can see why people complain the size, but after the guac, ceviche, and marg I was stuffed but the time I put away the last taco. If you want a huge taco go to Filabertos. Tell them Hi for me and thanks for the raging case of food poisoning I got from my last visit there.    Hubs had carnitas tacos, duck queso fundido (yes - duck meat in queso - genius!looked so good) and a half roast chicken. They all looked amazing ( no meat for this girl so looky no touchy) and he ended up taking the chicken home.  We shared the ejotes (green beans) and they were flavorful and fresh.  We ended the night with the churros with crema and spicy choc sauce. I was stuffed but I have a minor obsession with cinnamon/sugar desserts so had to try them. I brought a few home and they were tasty reheated in the oven. I wanted to pour the vanilla crema all over my husband (hey, we're newlyweds ok?) and do very bad things with it but I resigned myself to dipping the churros in it. I am a chocolate lover so for me to ignore the mexican choc sauce in favor of vanilla, trust me its good.  Can't wait to go back here - granted at $130 for a Friday night dinner it was pricey, but we totally overordered and indulged. Will be back for happy hour and special occaisions as long as this gem is able to stick around.

Veggie burger is for sure one of the best I've had, delish avocados and smeared with a cilantro sauce that was out of this world. As non-meat eater I definitely appreciate a home made veggie burger vice defrosted garden burger.  Hubs said his classic burger was very good but not unlike others he has had at burger focused restaurants.  To drink I went with the Caramel Sea Salt milkshake after 4 separate employees recommended it to me. A milkshake is something I order maybe one or two times a year and this one was so freaking good I can see myself packing on a few lbs just from wanting it again and again and again. Were talking rocks of sea salt in my mouth. Oh yes.   Fries were just right and spicy chipotle ketchup was a great accompaniment.  As for the line / corral nonsense, we arrived at 5PM for Saturday dinner so we really didn't wait, but by the time we left there were a good 30 people outside and at least 10 empty tables inside. I really had my doubts if Scottsdale peeps would line up at this place as I heard they do in TX .... Turns out they will but curious how long that will last. I can see your standard Scottsdale escalade driving frappucino drinking my-shit-don't-stink train wreck  group of guys trying to work the line here thinking they are all special and I don't think they will have much luck.   The "excuse" for the line is that you are waiting for a table to clear but it's pretty obvious they line you up to create an appearance of demand and exclusivity like a night club. You have to follow the rules like a good little sheep I mean customer or you won't get your delicious burger. Personally I find it annoying if tables are open I would rather wait at a table and chill with a drink vice lining up like cattle (Pun intended) but I have to give it to them it's a smart tactic and they are hustling you to buy a drink from the moment you walk up so they clearly have a lucrative setup. And considering I was balls deep in a $6 milkshake before I made it to the cashier to order their setup works. The only benefit is you don't have to play the game where some fat ass is saving a table for his friends who are still parking their cars and you are standing there like a schmuck with a tray of cold food waiting for a table to open.  I will definitely be back but if I see more then 10 people in that damn corral and can't snag a bar seat I will just go to smash burger.  I will try to stick to early dinners or lunch to avoid waiting needlessly. Time is clearly money here and I would prefer not to offer to much of either up if I can avoid it.  Everything was great and so was the service- based on the accents they must have brought TX employees in for the opening and I will be curious to see if local employees can keep the service levels as high.

Well I wish I could say the rest of the reviews here about the delivery experience were incorrect but unfortunately they're not. My store experience with Barbara Walters, yes that's her name, as my sales person she was absolutely wonderful and patient as my husband and I shopped for over 3 hours. In the end I purchased over $7000 of furniture at the Scottsdale location.  My delivery window today Sunday was from 12 to 6 PM. At 9 AM I received a call from the delivery driver to let me know he was ahead of schedule and would be at the house in 45 minutes to an hour. I was actually okay with this because I'm a huge Chicago fan and the bears are playing the Packers today which for anybody who knows anything about football is a huge deal. With the new delivery time I would miss maybe half the first quarter, that I can handle. So I rushed out of my current home to my New home where the furniture is to be delivered to meet the driver. Well it's now noon and still no driver.  I believe living spaces outsources their furniture delivery. They should seriously consider bringing this in-house even at a higher cost. Because of this experience I will not purchase any more furniture from living spaces. I have a large line of credit and a nearly empty home so this is a loss for them.  The quickest way to piss off a Chicagoan is to cause them to wait for hours in a home with no television during a Bears Packers game. Once my furniture arrives  I will update the review if I feel any differently. Considering it's now noon and I was called almost 3 hours ago I highly doubt anything will change unless this guy shows up with an iPad with 4G and the game on SundayTicket already streaming.

You guys. File this one under "you had one job."  I've ordered take out from here a couple times and the food is decent, mostly I chose this location because I'm a vegetarian/pescatarian and they offer Tom kha without meat.  So tonight I'm feeling under the weather and my sweet hubby offered to go get me tofu tom kha, along with pad Thai for himself.  He returned with a huge bag of food and just as he walked in the restaurant called. Apparently he had the wrong order. He said he asked the restaurant ten times if it was right because the total seemed high, but they assured him it was right and he didn't really know what I ordered. Sure enough we got the wrong order and were charged $50. So my being ill and dying for soup, my husband drove all the way back to pick up our correct order.   He walks in the door and I'm starving. Ready to eat my soup and go to bed.  So I dump my soup into a bowl and what do I see? Giant pieces of fatty gross chicken. Well you can imagine my husband is furious at this point but he maintains his composure and calls the restaurant receiving barely an apology. He drives now for the THIRD TIME to pick up a simple order of two items.  If you decide to order from this place double and triple check your order, or better yet stay away entirely!

Maybe everyone that wrote a five star review had a great experience, or maybe they just buy into the pretentious Scottsdale BS that this place has down to a science. I get that they took a high-end restaurant and turned it into a brunch spot but honestly the decor prices DJ the whole scene was totally over-the-top and they seem much more concerned about appearances then actual quality of service and food.  What's right: - Great Diverse Menu  - Great Drinks - Awesome Bloody Mary Bar - Clean  What's wrong: - Overpriced- we each had one drink and an entree and the bill was $90 for 4 people. For BREAKFAST - Awful staff - the manager is a total ass. I saw him yell at staff in a completely derogatory and condescending manner multiple times. He did literally nothing except try to look important when clearly his staff needs coaching on service. And the hostess had on booty jorts and a 2.99 tank top from forever 21. Not knocking that outfit in general but it seems kind of tacky considering the image they're trying to portray. Plus the gross manager was all brushing up on her. - No specials - not everyplace has to have unlimited mimosas but some sort of deal would be nice, like 2 for ten or something  - THE FREAKIN HASH! - i'm going to go out on a limb here but if you're going to put the word hash into the name of your business your hash should probably be pretty decent right? I ordered a hash with fresh lump crab on it and was pretty excited to try it. Unfortunately the sweet potatoes in the hash were completely undercooked and disgusting. So I sent back the hash and it came back out with cooked yet flavorless potatoes but now there is no egg on it. So by the time I got my food everyone was done eating and finally I got my complete meal about 40 minutes after I ordered. My sister ordered another hash with regular potatoes and was equally unimpressed. You just need to do something special if you're going to base your menu around something.  And the cardinal sin of all breakfast places as well as number one indicator a breakfast place will go out of business..... Drumroll please... They did not keep our coffee cups full. Each of us had coffee and it was only refilled one time and that was after sitting empty for at least 10 minutes. The server brought the check and never asked if we wanted more but we did so we asked for more which turned out to be a good idea because we waited about another 15 minutes for our credit card to be run.   I give points for the menus creativity but the execution is bad and the service worse. I give this place 2 stars and 6 months!
