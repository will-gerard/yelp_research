Definitely one of the finest restaurants in Phoenix, and I'm picky!  The food is incredible, the service is delightful, and the prices are reasonable.  I have been blown away every time I've come here.  Woohoo!  As good as it gets!

I'm shocked that this place doesn't have more 5 star reviews!  They really go so above and beyond!  The food is exceptional with tons of delicious choices on the menu, and the service is so warm and friendly.  A very nice Italian family that knows what they're doing:)  Also, this place is in no way overpriced!  I always feel like they are losing money off of me!

By far the WORST wash I have ever received anywhere, and this was a $70.00 service.  I still have stains on my passenger side carpet (which was the reason for getting the shampooing in the first place).  I don't think that they even washed it as they were supposed to.  I had to tell them for 20 minutes major areas that they had missed.   I need to clean all of  the windows myself since they are dirty still and have water spots and fingerprints on them.  The guy I arranged everything with was nice and assured me everything would be perfect.  I told him if I was going to pay so much I was going to be very picky.  He understood and guaranteed it would be perfect.  However, he was not the one doing the work.   I would be upset if I had only paid $12.00, because there are plenty of places that do a much more thorough cleaning for that.  But having paid far more, I feel the need to alert my fellow yelpers to this scam of a car wash.  My car reeks of mildew and the wet seat with whatever they used to clean stained my shorts a yellowy brown color.  Thank God I didn't have somewhere to be after the car wash.  This place is a nightmare!

I used to like this place a lot, and was a very frequent customer.  I have become increasingly irritated with their mistakes, however, and now will not return.  They don't pack the food up properly so every time there is a huge mess to clean up with sauce everywhere.  It gets all over everything because it is not packaged in a way that prevents leakage. They frequently forget to include sauces or make mistakes by sending the incorrect item(s).  My most recent order was very different from the menu descriptions and when I called thinking they would want to bring me different dishes to make it right, they were very unaccomodating (even the owner).  They have lost a regular customer due to their poor customer service and lack of accurate menu descriptions.  Also, I am always shorted on rice. If I order two dishes, I expect to get two rice containers, not just one.  This is always frustrating, and even when I have asked for extra rice, they don't seem to include it. Isn't rice cheap?  I don't know why they are so stingy with it.

This place is FANTASTIC!   The food is truly top of the line.  My favorite German dish, the sausage sampler, is done better here than at any other German restaurant I have been to in the U.S., and I have been to a handful, and always order the same thing(s).  The salad bar is exceptional  as well.  It always has some of the best potato and macaroni salad around in addition to fresh fruit and a variety of salad ingredients and dressings.

This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant anywhere!   The food is incredible as is the atmosphere!  The service is also top notch!  I highly recommend their Pad Thai and Tropical Pineapple, but everything I've tried from here has been very memorable!  The portions are large too, which is good since you won't want to put your fork down!  Just beware, once you try Malee's you will start to crave it ALL the time - it's that yummy.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!

I would've been totally satisfied with my " to go" mocha experience if my bank statement didn't reveal that I was charged an additional $3.00 above the price on my receipt.  WTF?!  I will not be returning here for my coffee fix!  I would recommend cash only if you choose to go.

Stingray used to be my favorite place to go for sushi but after numerous poor experiences during the past year or so, I don't intend to go back, at least to this location.  It is difficult to believe that the restaurant is owned by the same people that own Geisha.  The sushi at Geisha is equally as good, but the service is much much better.  At Geisha they are super friendly and welcoming, and check on you to make sure you don't need anything, and like the food.  At Stingray they are rude,  very unwelcoming, and not helpful at all.  I personally don't enjoy going to eat where the waitresses are completely bitchy, which has frequently been the case at Stingray.  There is no excuse for this. Cute atmosphere and good sushi do not make up for the mistreatment of their patrons.  I was very loyal to Stingray for years, always recommending it to others, but everyone I've taken there lately has had negative experiences with the service from rude waitresses to empty glasses to messing up the orders.  If you want good sushi just go to Geisha which is across the street from Stingray.  It is open til midnight just like Stingray and the staff has been properly trained there, a very nice touch:)

This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area and beyond!  The service is always great, and the food is always absolutely perfect.  The portions are gigantic.  I always have to share my meal with at least one other person.  My favorite dish is the Gyro Dinner.  It comes with gyro meat, pita,  lemony potatoes, rice, and grilled vegetables.  It is AMAZING!  Also, the  Marinated Chicken Breast is another favorite, and comes with the same things.  Their Pizzas are delicious too, and the Avgolemono Soup is out of this world.  The Dolmades have also become a recent favorite MMmmmmmm!!!!!!!  This restaurant is one of the very few that has never disappointed me.  It is consistently fabulous, and I recommend it 100%

This is the best dog park I've been to in Arizona!   There are multiple fenced in areas for passive and aggressive dogs, and everything is very well maintained.  I also love that it is just down the street from a lake to combine the dog park outing with a nice walk.

How every Post Office should be!  Extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and upbeat staff!  Open until 9:30 pm M-F and until 5 on Saturday.  There is even a drive-thru mailbox if you don't feel like going inside and are mailing something small with a collection time of 9 pm!  A+++++++++

My FAVORITE place to shop!  I like this location better than the one in Tempe Marketplace... even though they supposedly have the same stuff, I always find more things to buy here.   They have all sorts of cute clothes, from dresses and jeans to shoes and sweats, all at great prices!

This is currently my absolute favorite place to go for sushi in Arizona, and as an avid sushi connoisseur,  I have pretty much tried them all.  It consistently tastes extremely fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere is lively and fun, and the menu offers more than just sushi for people who aren't big on the eating of raw fish.  The service is also very friendly and welcoming.  It is a great place to go for a drink, a meal, or of course both.

Everything I have tried here is delish!!!! I don't care for most Mexican food (it's the one type of food I try to avoid aside from chips and salsa) but this place has become one of my FAVORITE restaurants! I've been twice in one week and have been telling everybody about it! The atmosphere is fun, the service is great, and the food is unbeatable! They have delicious chips and salsa! The salads are phenomenal, with all sorts of fresh fruits from pumpkin to pomegranate mixed in, and the seared ahi tuna torta is incredible! Their iced tea even tastes special, and so far all of the desserts are out out of this world!  I especially liked the smore one!  I love that they have a wide range of choices, definitely not just typical Mexican options here.

I was excited to try this place since it has lots of reviews and 4 stars. I figured it must be good!  It is a rarity that I find Yelp to be inaccurate based on the ratings of others.  I was extremely disappointed!   The lady who seated us and waited on us was blatantly rude.  I have never had such terrible service, anywhere, ever!  She seemed angry at us just for coming into the establishment.  I figured at least the food would be good, based on the reviews of my fellow Yelpers, however, it was NOT!    The Pad Thai noodles were overcooked, and the dish was bland.  There were no sprouts to help offset the sogginess.  The dish was not served with lime.  It was easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had, and Pad Thai happens to be my favorite food, so I eat it all the time, and from lots of different Thai restaurants.  I didn't care for their lettuce wraps either, but something like Pad Thai should be a staple at a Thai restaurant, and should certainly not disappoint as theirs did.     The atmosphere was nice enough.  It looks like the location used to be a Wendy's or something, and they've fixed it up nicely.  It lacks a lot of Asian flare, but that is the least of their worries based on having experienced their food and service.    What a shame - they even have a drive-thru!  I certainly would have been back, had it not been such a negative experience.    Recommended Thai Restaurant alternatives: Wild Thaiger, Malee's, and Soi 4 Bangkok Eatery to name a few of my faves.  Wild Thaiger has my favorite Pad Thai and is also in the Phoenix area as opposed to Scottsdale like Malee's and Soi 4.

Dr. Yu is the best Doctor I have ever seen!  He takes a special interest in his patients, and is very thorough.  He diagnosed my Vitamin B12 deficiency several years ago, a test that most Doctors don't test for, and because of that I will always be so grateful.   I continue to commute to his office from Scottsdale when I have any concerns about my health, since no other Doctor that I've been to can compare.  I highly recommend Dr. Yu to anyone looking for an extraordinary Doctor.  He will do everything in his power to figure out what is wrong and make you feel better.   I know I'm not alone in my feelings about Dr. Yu, since he has received countless awards.
