Avoid this place if your new to paintball. I went her to buy all my paintball equipment and was sold a paintball marker that was leaking air. i was told it was supposed to leak a little air but after contacting another shop and manufacture i was told absolutely it should not leak. and also bought a air thru stock for the marker and remote adapter which was missing  critical piece and could not be used and the remote line was wrong also so that was 100  dollars of waist of money they they will not let me return.   Remember All sales are final. just another place that lies to ,make sales

I liked Joe's Crab shack; the waitstaff were always friendly to us and made sure the food was good and the drinks flowed.  I thought the crab was delicious and plenty of it.  The crab pots are fun and full of good non crab food as well.

I was hoping this was going to be Great. but right off the bat as we were being seated we asked for a booth (there was only 2 of us) we were told  we could not have a booth because it was busy. it was only half  full. after we were seated  we noticed many couples  being seated at a booth.                the food was Average and side portions are tiny.  my wife asked for a side salad and  did not get the salad till just Before she brought us the check
