I seriously can not believe I've been wasting my time/money/hair anywhere else.  This place is amazing.  I don't go to a stylist - I'm a man who relies on a strong jaw and deep, dreamy eyes for his presentation, not fancy hair perms. When I get up in the morning, I maybe have time to rub some wax through my hair before I'm driving cars and flexing muscles and being generally masculine and handsome, so I go to simple hair places where they can just cut my hair, and I can get on with my day.  My pet peeve is when I go to get my hair cut, and the hair cutter person asks me what I want, and then has a bunch of questions. I don't have time for that mess - just cut the hair! I don't care if you use clippers or scissors or a weed eater, just do the job and make me look good so I can get back to things. My experience at V's is just that - "How do you want your hair?" Just make it look good.  Boom - job's done.  But wait...  Finishing up the job with a straight razor shave on my neck, ears, and sideburns? Uhmm... yes please.  A quick trim of the eyebrows, a brief neck and shoulders massage, and a hot towel?  Awesome.  And I was in and out with no wait.  I'm not going anywhere else from now on.

There's not a lot to say about this place.  They have an enormous amount of pots.  I'm not good at estimating numbers this large, but I'm going to say they have about 15,000 pots, from tiny plastic pots, to several-thousand-dollar planters.  The pots appeared to have a variety of origins, qualities, and styles.  We bought several, and they're great.  I found this place because I was at Home Depot, trying to buy two matching pots, and I noticed the tag on one of them said it was from The Plant Stand of Arizona.  So I tracked it down, and indeed this seems to be the supply point for a lot of pots.  It's in the back of a shady neighborhood - just keep driving.  They also have a selection of plants.  There weren't many when we visited, but it looks like seasonally, that probably changes.  Still, they had enough to be interesting.

I've been here twice.  The people are very friendly, and that counts for something, but the actual quality of the wash is somewhere between 'Not good' and 'Unacceptable'.  I have a sports car, and both times I've come, I've asked for a hand wash, and both times the guy at the entry said something to the effect of "Hey man - let's just run it through the machine.  I promise it won't hurt it!" which was true - it didn't hurt it, but it also didn't really do a good job of washing it either.  If it's convenient to stop here, go ahead - I don't think you're in danger.  But if you want a good car wash, this ain't it.

I don't really have to say much here: This place has snow cones. What else do you want? Water? Ice? They probably have that too. In fact, I'm pretty sure they do. They also have a small, but very quality selection of candies and sodas. Whoever is doing their purchasing is incredibly knowledgable. I've eaten a friggin' TON of candy and soda in my life. I'm basically dead on the inside. So when I say they've got a good selection, you know it's a good selection. It's a good selection.

This is the 4th Melting Pot I have been to, and the experience is very standard compared to what I am used to.  We were treated with respect, the experience was very smooth and fluid, and the food was delicious.  Don't come here if you're on a budget, as most of the dinner options are fairly expensive, and make sure you don't have anywhere to be afterwards, as a full meal can take over two hours.

My girlfriend and found Rubio's because we were new to the area and were looking for a good Mexican place.  This was not it.  But... it's still amazing.  It's a chain, and a fast-food joint, so don't expect something else, but their food is really pretty spectacular for the price.  They have a bar full of different salsas and lemon slices and lime slices which is nice to add to your meal, but the food itself is really fresh and healthy-feeling.  I don't know if it's actually healthy because I'm not a doctor but I can tell you it 'feels' healthy.  I recommend the shrimp tacos.  Delicious.  That's all I can say.  Finally, another reviewer (Michelle N.) said there's a drive thru here.  There isn't.

If you've not been to a Waffle House before... well... that's pretty odd, but this is a good one to start at.  Basically, they have delicious breakfast foods, and then a variety of other lunch/dinner options, but if you're at Waffle House and you're not eating breakfast, you're doing it wrong.  It's a diner, so the atmosphere is great.  Sit up at the bar and watch them prep the food and enjoy the delicious smells, or grab a booth by the window and stare out into the parking lot while you try to ignore your hangover.  The people working here are friendly, and the establishment is clean.  The food is prepared well, and delicious.  I recommend the biscuits and gravy.

This is a great place for ice cream or just desert in general. I have been here many times, and they are always friendly, the ice cream is always plentiful and delicious, and it's a clean, modern place so you can bring the kids or family or whatever, and feel good about it.  Here is my personal recommendation: Get an Oreo ice cream sandwich. This is Oreo ice cream in between two giant Oreos. It's kind of a mess to eat, but they give you a cup with it so you can catch your crumbs and eat them at the end. It's delicious. I could eat 4 of these things except I'm not a freakin' pig!

I don't understand the people who have caused the rating of this place to be so low.  I am not a Thai person, but I know delicious food when I put it in my mouth, and this place is great.  First the atmosphere: This is a fairly small place with a warm, pleasant feeling.  It's usually not crowded, so it's not a bad place to go to have a little dinner conversation, and maybe get a little bit romantic.  Maybe move in close with your lover and get some kisses in before you order those spicy dishes.  The food is great.  Fantastic flavor, good spice (I order 'medium' which is just enough to make me keep reaching for my drink), and reasonable sized portions.  A hungry person can go away fed but not bloated, and someone with a little appetite can have a little to take home!  I pretty consistently order the Beef Drunken Noodles (without onion, because I am a lover and have to keep that fresh breath) which have incredible flavor, and are a dish which I haven't been able to find at a lot of other Thai restaurants.  I definitely recommend it, and if you don't like it then you probably don't know what good food tastes like!

This is a great location, with great customer service. The food is exactly what you should expect from Sonic, and very consistent, as are the beverages. Their outdoor seating is usually not occupied, so it's a great and cheap place to just swing by and grab some food and chill out for a few.

One day I was making some chicken, and when it was done, I looked at it and said to my wife, "Damn - we can't eat that. That's disgusting."  So she threw it away and I drove to KFC, because we already had buns with mayo and lettuce, we just needed the chicken. They've got this new menu, and one of the things on it is called "Tenders and Wedges for Two" which is awesome, because that is exactly what I want. Now I haven't been to a KFC in like, 8 years. So how did I know the menu was new? Because when I ordered it, the guy at the counter had no idea what I was talking about. I mean he was cool about it - he wasn't an idiot - I was just apparently the first person ever to order that. So he called up two other guys and they all tried to find the item on the register so I could order it, and eventually the first guy found it, and everybody went back to chicken making.  And the chicken was pretty dagone good.  I totally recommend you make your own sandwiches, but then toss in a couple of chicken tenders. Delicious 'tendies' as some call them. And the potato wedges were great too.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.  So why not try it out? Chicken?!

This place is absolutely amazing.  The service is incredible, and you can tell that they really care about their customers and the food they provide.  It seems to be family-run, and they are extremely attentive and helpful when a dumb American such as myself is trying to order things he doesn't know about or understand.  The food is awesome.  I like spicy food, and I order a '7' out of '10', which gives me some real heat and keeps me reaching for my Kingfisher beer.  Everything is amazing - perfectly spiced, cooked, and portioned.  The atmosphere is wonderful too.  I don't know what a traditional Indian place is supposed to look like, but it's authentic enough for me.  The last time I was here, there was a large indian family sitting near us, and they kept talking about how wonderful the food was, so apparently it's the real deal too.  I confidently give this place 5 stars.  There is nothing I would change.

I just got glasses AND contacts from this joint, so I'm going to give you the inside scoop. I know that is why you come to me.  This place is in a strip mall attached to a Fry's. It's not facing the same way as Fry's though - it's over to the side of it. I hate it when I can't find a place and it's like, around some little corner of the strip mall tucked behind a Subway. It's a good location though, and there's always space in the parking lot there, so it's pretty chill.  Inside this place it's like every optometrist, with lots of glass and mirrors and lights and pictures of people wearing glasses and a bunch of glasses to buy. The front desk seems to usually have a couple of ladies there and when you walk in, they kind of let you make the first move, so you should be ready to explain why you're there, like say "Hey I'm here to get some glasses." and probably you should call and make an appointment ahead of time.  Getting your eyes examined is pretty standard. They don't do anything that hurts, which I really appreciate. Whenever a doctor does something that hurts, it's like... what the hell.  They have this machine they charge extra for that takes a picture of the inside of your eyeball. I paid for that and it was ok. It would have been really sweet if they printed it out like a poster for you, but the doctor just looks at it to make sure there's nothing going on in there that shouldn't be. Thank freakin' hell there wasn't, right?  Doctor Pratt then does the real examination and does things like have you look through the thing with all of the lenses that they flip around and say "This one" or "This one" or sometimes they say "Number one... or Number two..." Here, I will tell you something really great about Doctor Pratt. Sometimes they give you two options, and they're really freakin close. Like, you basically can't tell the difference. But if the goal here is to figure out what's best for your eyes, give me some time to try and sort it out, you know? And sometimes with eye doctors, you feel like they're trying to rush you. Like slow down damn it and let me look at the corners or the edges or the curves or something. Doctor Pratt was really relaxed with that.  He also uses some machine that basically shines a light that's as bright as the freakin' sun in your eye, but again, it doesn't hurt, and I guess he's looking for things in the eye that the photograph wouldn't capture or something? I'm not sure. I'm not the eye doctor here, but it seems like he knew what he was doing.  Anyway, I ordered contacts and glasses through Lifetime. I usually order contacts and glasses through the place where I get my eyes checked. It's usually hella more expensive, but to me, it's worth it to be able to have the whole thing in one company's hands, end to end. With the contacts, it was great because they actually showed me how to put them in and take care of them in an hour-long session. Now, I didn't need the full hour because with my hands, I'm basically a magic man, but it's nice to have that time set aside for questions that someone might have, or practicing putting contacts in, because honestly it's hard to learn to poke yourself in the eye.  As for glasses, the selection isn't bad, but it's not great. There are a lot of very similar looks. I need some glasses with attitude. If you want glasses that look like what other people are probably wearing, then they've got something you'll like. If you're a hipster or need a look that says "I will choke you" or something like that, you're gonna be limited here. They seem to be a little restricted on their lens tinting options also. The darkest sun glasses I could get here are probably fantastic for UV, but I need dark lenses, so that my foe can't see my eyes, and these aren't those. The lenses themselves they're able to get fairly thin, but their lab doesn't roll the edges, so they still look a bit thicker than they need to.  Overall, fantastic place, and I definitely recommend it. I do wish they had a wider selection of frames, and better lens options, but if you don't like what you see there, just go somewhere else, you turkey!

By most measures this is a pretty standard sandwich shop. I actually think their weakness is their bread, which is pretty uninspiring. That said, the meats and cheeses seem to be of quality, and the menu has some interesting options. Anybody who puts cranberry sauce on a turkey sandwich gets a vote from me.  When I was there, the place was almost empty, and service was fast. It's a little divey, which isn't bad for a sandwich shop, so that's not a complaint. I might come here again, but I don't anticipate craving it.

I came here with my fiance's family for dinner and a little casual celebration.  The food was fantastic and the service was good.  The only down side is that the place is a bit noisy, and a little crowded.  People kept bumping into my chair as they passed, and while it's not overly loud, forget about holding a quiet private conversation.  I had one of their specials that day, a shrimp ravioli, which was exceptional, with nice sized pieces of shrimp cut up into the sauce.  The chef seems to really know what he's doing.

When I was a small child, I had a butcher of a dentist, so I developed an irrational fear of them, and am extremely picky about the dental care I receive. I don't tolerate pain, and I like to be informed - not treated like a common rube. I have tried several dentists in the area since moving to Phoenix, so when I rate Dr. Ito and his crew 5-stars, that's a pretty serious thing.  I came here because I needed to have a crown replaced after it cracked in half. The staff here is very efficient - friendly but down-to-business, and in the 3 times I've been here, I've never had to wait past the scheduled time of my appointment. Michelle is efficient with paperwork and scheduling, and I've no complaints with the process whatsoever.  The rest of the staff is friendly and informative. I'm not a dentist or a doctor, but I'm also not a moron, so I like it when the hygienist explains what's going on to me, so I'm not surprised by anything, and so I can make my own evaluations of what's happening. Everyone here is very informative, and they let me know what's going on at every step of the process, and why.  As for Dr. Ito himself, he seems like a really nice, friendly guy, which is very strange. Most doctors I've met have some fairly strange personalities. I guess that goes with the territory of poking people with needles and scalpels and drills, but still - weird. Dr. Ito seems perfectly normal. I'm not going to say that he's not a real dentist, because he is, but if you were to pay an actor to pretend to be a dentist, you'd end up with something like Ito.  Finally, the most important part: The actual dental work. Ok, like I said, I'm not a dentist, but here's how you numb someone: You rub a little topical anesthetic on the gums where you're going to stab them with a needle. This is so that when you stab them in the mouth with a needle, it doesn't hurt like hell. Then, once the spot is numb, you pump them full of novocaine - a little first, then a bunch, and then they don't have to endure that exquisite pain of having the nerves in your teeth drilled away. Most dentists can't get this right. Dr. Ito did it perfectly.  No pain whatsoever.  Additionally, a lot of dentists use a drill like they're working on a piece of wood or stone, just grinding away at you like hell until inexplicably they determine they've done enough damage and they patch you up. Not so with Dr. Ito. Even with my mouth numbed up, it was obvious that he was very intentional with his actions while using the drill. He's not just grinding a tree stump out - he's removing specific areas for specific reasons. That's a very different feeling from what I experience with most dentists.  Anyway, the joint is clean and quiet, and they have TV's if you want to watch those while you get worked on. I'm always too terrified to pretend to focus on anything else. The people are nice and they talk during their work to distract you a little bit, which is nice.  I'll be returning for regular checkups and maintenance!

Guys it's Cracker Barrel - if you're not having a good time you either didn't know what Cracker Barrel is, or you're ordering the wrong stuff.  It's a breakfast place, so as soon as you sit down just give them the lunch menu back, because you don't want anything on it.  Then, open up the breakfast menu and find 'Uncle Hershels Breakfast' and order that.  Then eat it.  That's pretty much all you have to do.  If you actually haven't been to a Cracker Barrel before, then know this: There are about 1000 of them, and they're a country restaurant and a store that sells candy and beanie babies and a whole bunch of garbage that only an old person would want, but nobody's forcing you to buy the stuff, so just eat the breakfast and get over it.

I came here because of the good rating on Yelp, but when I arrived, I was kind of put-off by the interior. This is not a fancy place. But... that's not why you're here. You're here because they have awesome pizza.  The service is good - nothing to rave about, but friendly enough, and they kept my drink full. The pizza on the other hand, was incredible. I didn't go off of the menu - I created my own, so I won't just brag about my incredible sense of taste, but the ingredients were very fresh, and the pizza was cooked to perfection.  A little bit more atmosphere could kick this place up to 5 stars easily, but hey, if you want atmosphere go somewhere else. If you want awesome pizza, stop in here.

The wireless router I rent from Cox was getting flaky, so I packed it up and headed over to this location to get it replaced.  There were tons of staff to help, they didn't ask me a bunch of questions, and I was in and out with a new wireless router in literally, 3 minutes.  Great experience, particularly compared to Comcast, where I almost killed myself once.

I am not Vietnamese, but this food rocks, this place rocks, and the staff rocks.  First off the food is awesome. I don't know what authentic Vietnamese food tastes like, but as far as I'm concerned, if this isn't authentic, then I don't want authentic. Fresh ingredients, good spices, and fun options.  Secondly, the atmosphere in here is modern and really fun.  Apparently a Cyclo is a type of Vietnamese bike-cart type thing piloted by skeletons, and they're all over the place, along with cool modern art.  Lastly and most importantly, the staff is really fun. When we came in, the lady who seated us and took our order (I think she's the owner) harassed us for taking too long to order, and then started hitting on one of my associates because he was from Utah and thus probably a polygamist to her. It was super fun.  I've been back only once since, but I can't wait to go again!

Considering it's at the mall, this is a pretty reliable location for a quick treat, whether it's after shopping, after lunch, or whenever. The staff is friendly and fast, and the location is clean. They have very limited seating, but the front of the store is all glass, so it gives you a fun view of mall and movie theater patrons.

BJ's is a pretty great place.  It's a chain, but don't let that turn you off.  They have a large, delicious menu, and a selection of both on-site brewed, locally-brewed, and general beers.  It's got a nice atmosphere, so would be suitable for a business lunch, date, or just a trip with friends.  This location is in a plaza with a large mall, theater, and a ton of other places, so it's a great place to go, have a couple brews, and then do some shopping or see a movie!

Let me be clear and direct in this review: I am a MAN and when I go to Chipotle I do not order a salad or a hand full of chips.  I order a BURRITO, with MEAT.  I have eaten at over FOUR Chipotles, which basically makes me an expert of Chipotle, burritos, and all food in general.  One of the greatest things about Chipotle is consistency; you can walk into a Chipotle in anywhere in the world and you know that your food is going to be fresh and delicious.  What you don't necessarily know though, is the attitude.  Is this a Chipotle where everyone is happy and burritos are being tossed joyously from one person to another in celebration of food preparation?  Or is this Chipotle run by a dirty, filthy man who hates you simply for being alive, and will follow you out to your car and mug you?  Nobody knows.  Except me, because I've eaten at this one several times.  This is a magnificent Chipotle.  The people are good spirited, helpfully construct your burrito quickly, and pleasantly.  Sometimes I go into this Chipotle and I'm like, "Eh, not having such a great day - maybe a burrito will make me happy" and do you know what?  I go into this place, and everybody is happy and working and it's like, "Yeah... yeah now I'm feeling a little better.  Maybe things aren't so bad.  Maybe she still loves me."  So to summarize, this is a great Chipotle.  It's bright, friendly, ample parking, and the same fresh and delicious ingredients you expect.

When I lived in Pittsburgh, I would go to Pipers every weekend for brunch. Brian was always manning the bar, ready to serve up a Strongbow from the tap, and the boxtys were always incredible.  Well - things change. I've moved away now, but I still stop by Pipers when I come back to town to visit. They use ground sausage instead of real bangers in the Irish Boxtys now, which is a bummer, but it's still the most incredible brunch place you could wish for.  The people are great, the food is delicious, the beer list is fabulous (they usually have at least 2 cask beers available, and the tap list is extensive).  Basically, if you live in Pittsburgh, you should be eating here.  If you're just visiting town, stop in.  And if you ever meet someone who doesn't like this place, push them to the ground, and hold them there until the police can arrive, and then explain the issue and that the person is insane, and the police will probably lock them up for the good of society.

I went here with my wife and her family for her birthday. The entire experience was incredible.  First and foremost, I had a dry aged steak, and it was the best steak I believe I have ever had in my life.  Cooked perfectly rare, and paired with potatoes and truffle mac and cheese, it was the perfect dinner.  The staff was incredible from the moment we arrived at the complimentary valet, and every single person we interacted with was professional, but not stuffy or stuck up, making us feel perfectly at home.  Everything was perfect, from the ambiance to the wine. I could say more, but seriously, 5-stars.  Just go.  If you're looking for a romantic evening, I'd definitely suggest Lon's, and we will be headed back soon.

I am probably not the most experienced individual to judge steak, but I can say my food was delicious, and the atmosphere here is something unique that I have not found anywhere else.  You enter through the kitchen, which I know people trash as being a bit of a novelty, but whatever - I'm here to have a good time so the novelty is just something fun!  Relax for the love of Todd.  It's like stepping back in time when you enter here, but not in a dirty way - in a classy way.  The waiters are very formal and super polite.  The decorating is like something out of an old mobster movie.  In fact if you're going here, make sure you're dressed up like an old-timey mobster or dame.  And it's a steak place, so order some steak why don't you?!  They have everything from petite fillets to massive monster 96 ounce beasts of meat that you get your name on a plaque for actually finishing.  When I went, it was busy, so the service was a little slow, but you're not here to rush in and out - you're here to sit around and have a good time and enjoy some drinks and delicious meat.  Also, even though the service was slow, it wasn't 'rushed-slow', it was 'relaxed-slow' and attentive, so we never felt neglected.  It's 5-stars, so just go take a look why don't you?!

Hold on to your spare ribs because there is major competition for delicious BBQ in the Chandler/Ahwatukee region. Famous Dave's is one of three different chains which I rate quite highly around here. Great meat, great sauces, and great sides. So what's the difference? Famous Dave's is more of a sit-down place than most of the other options, which offer more of a cafeteria-style situation. This has its benefits, as the service is good, and the atmosphere is a step up, but you'll pay slightly more than you might at Rudy's or another BBQ joint. Still - 4 stars, and this is a great place to come for lunch specials.

Let me start out by saying despite the low rating, this Hilton does have some redeeming qualities: the people are friendly, it's clean, the rooms are nice, it has a decent pool.  But you can get that a lot of places.  The "On The Las Vegas Strip" part of the title of the hotel is very misleading.  It is technically on the strip, yes, but it is a 20 minute walk past abandoned construction sites to get to anything other than Circus Circus.  I ended up taking taxis to get anywhere most of the time, and learned that the large building across the street had been under construction/abandoned since 2008, along with several other properties around this hotel in similar situations.  This is not "On The Strip".  There's a pool bar with a menu and drinks, but there's no restaurant in this hotel.  You can go down to the first floor and order a $15 frozen pizza that they heat up for you, or have one delivered to your room, but if you want to sit down for a nice meal, you're out of luck.  This I find completely inexcusable.  I'm in Vegas for the love of Todd - I'm there to either gamble (can't do that at the hotel), eat (can't do that at the hotel), or see a show (can't do that at the hotel).  Total disappointment, and a poor representation of Hilton.  It actually seems like they're using this hotel specifically to coerce people into timeshares, although I can't believe they have good luck with it given the lack of amenities at the property.  I'm just assuming that based on the number of people I spoke with who were there on 'free' vacations if they listened to a presentation and high pressure sales pitch on timeshares.  Anyway - like I said.  If you don't care about being 'on the strip' or don't mind taking a taxi every time (ranged from about $10-$20 for a one-way trip depending on traffic), and don't care about close by food options, and don't want to gamble at your hotel, this is probably fine.  But if you want the Vegas experience, head south more and actually stay on the strip.

Wow what a great place for freakin' good BBQ. When you walk in to Joe's you might think you are in a woodland area where the beasts of the forest are having a meat smoking and grilling festival because the place looks crazy, like it's built out of trees and it's all decorated for halloween or christmas or whatever season it is, but nope - you're just in Joe's REAL BBQ, and I can promise you first hand that THE BBQ IS ACTUALLY REAL, LET THERE BE NO DOUBT.  The service here is good, and they are friendly enough, and you can see all of the food which tempts the mind and taste buds, and if you're like me, you're going to end up ordering almost everything because it all looks so good.  The one down-side to this place is it's not always the cleanest joint, like sometimes you'll want to sit at a table but then you'll say "Oh buddy, wait - not this one, because it looks like someone else just ate here and I don't want to get some other person's BBQ sauce on my arms." but you can just go to another table. It's not like it's unsanitary or anything.  This place is right across the street from another incredible BBQ joint: Rudy's. Which one is better? Here's how I decide: Do you want the focus of your meal to be the delicious meats? Go to Rudy's. Do you want the focus of your meal to be the delicious sides? Go to Joe's.  I'm not saying either place doesn't have good meats or sides, but Joe's wins the sides contest, and Rudy's wins the plain ol' meat contest. Heck, these places are so close you could probably just walk across the street and get the best of both. I am honestly surprised that these two places have not gotten into more of a bitter competition. In my youth I was involved in a similar situation where several young people lost their lives due to the BBQ war that occurred, so I guess it is for the best that you choose one place or the other, and not tempt fate by visiting both.

Let me say that I do like the atmosphere of Sushi Ken's.  It's friendly, casual, and feels like what I think a sushi place should feel like.  That said, we ordered some tuna sashimi in order to get a feel for what the quality was like before ordering anything else, and I'm pretty sure that what we were served was shipped in frozen.  It was not good.  We ate it out of respect, and left.

I started going here instead of the Safeway across the street because I was tired of purchasing stuff and then getting home and finding out it was expired. Fry's is much better about keeping their inventory current, and I think that's because they have a lot more people shopping there. The prices are slightly better (usually), but the place is a lot more crowded, which is annoying. Their produce selection is slightly better than Safeway, meaning most of the plums and pears and stuff like that is rock hard, and the berries often are beat to hell or have some mold on some of them already, which isn't cool, but sometimes you get lucky, like today they had avocados that were just perfect.  This location also has some toys and cleaning supplies and gardening and auto supplies and things like that. It's not like going to a Walmart or Target but it's nice to be able to pick up some extra things without making two stops.

Seems like a lot of people have a lot to complain about when it comes to urgent care, but I'm going to get right to it. There's only one thing that matters when it comes to urgent care: Do I think they'd let me die in the waiting room. If not, then we're talking business. Urgent Care is never gonna be fast, because whatever idiot thing you did to end up in there, like shooting yourself with an arrow or being a filthy dirty sick hobo, there's somebody who walked in before you and did something even stupider, and the doctor has to deal with that, so just calm the hell down. Or not, maybe they're banging back there for all we know, but the point is, they'll help you as soon as they can.  We came in because my wife had a swollen lip from an allergic reaction, and everyone was friendly and helpful. The doctor who saw us said something like "You just tell me if he hit you, and I'll hit him back." and it was funny because he was being cool about it, but also I bet he could have beat the crap out of me, so I've been working out since then.  This place is super clean, and seems really modern. They basically just built it, so it better be, right? But yeah, it's in good shape. You could sleep on the floor here even though I'm sure it's already seen horrible, horrible things.

If you've been in a drug store before, you pretty much know what to expect at this Walgreens. It has a 24/7 pharmacy, which is really convenient, and a pharmacy drive-through. They have 24/7 photo processing, for when you need to print out photos for a school project and your printer inevitably is out of ink. It's a clean store, large, with lots of miscellaneous items like peanut butter and hair dryers, and the staff are friendly enough.  Added bonus: This Walgreens has a clinic inside, so when you come down with strep or something, it's convenient to just stop in and see the doctor. Depending on your luck, you might wait anywhere from 15 minutes to a couple hours though, so you might want to schedule ahead online.

I've only been here once, but they were friendly, fast, and inexpensive for my shipping needs.  I will return!

I went here with my wife to find some kind of hair serum that keeps little stray hairs from poking up on your head. It's honestly kind of neat stuff, and she ordered it online from Sephora before.  Ok, so first off, whoever organized this store was a crack head - and by that I mean they had to have literally been pumped full of crack cocaine in order to think anyone would be able to find anything in the maze they had created. Half of the store is organized by brand, and half by type of product, and then half of it seems to be stocked at random based on what sale is going on at the moment. I realize that is three halves, which doesn't make any sense, but I wasn't the one who organized the store.  Add to that, the place was completely packed. Probably because it takes people a long time to get through it because they have no idea how to find what they want.  Add to that, the Sephora employees are easy to spot because they're wearing black and red, and standing around in groups of 3-4, ignoring customers.  Basically, if I owned a store like this, I'd burn it down and become a hermit. We left without getting any help, and without finding what we wanted. We'll shop Sephora online next time.

This place is really good. Really good. I don't know anything about Korean food, but a friend suggested we go here, and it was incredible. I had the spicy beef, which wasn't very spicy, but was very delicious. It was served with these six little dishes of various things I couldn't exactly identify, like some apples in a white sauce, and some kind of noodles, and some kind of cabbage, and a couple sauces, and then some seaweed paper. I don't know what they were, but trying them all made the experience really fun.  Don't let the exterior dissuade you - this is a great place to eat, with some really awesome options on the menu. I don't know if I'd suggest it for a date since the atmosphere isn't very romantic, but it'd probably be fun for a family dinner, or eating some some friends.

This is a fairly large art supply store.  They do custom framing, which was what brought me in.  With a large selection of frames, friendly, helpful staff, and quality work, I'm very satisfied.  I'm not much of an artist, but if you are, and you're looking for supplies, I can't imagine anything that they either do not have in stock, or can not order for you.

If you are in the mood for delicious shrimp tacos or fish tacos or a big burrito filled with lobster, and you are also standing in the middle of the mall food court, then I have wonderful news for you, because look around you big dongus, you're standing right by Rubio's Fresh Mexican Grill and it is THE place to go to get the aforementioned food items.  Don't get me wrong, you're still at the mall foodcourt, but this is pretty much the real deal as far as Rubio's goes, and it's gonna be delicious. It takes a little longer than Panda Express or the pizza joint but that's because they're making the food fresh and not just serving you something that's been hanging out under heat lights. As soon as you put the food into your mouth hole you are going to taste the difference, and it is delicious.  Best thing about Rubio's? You can eat it and afterwards you don't feel like dying. Just don't order too much, you big hog, and you'll be energized and ready to go back into the depths of the mall and do more shopping or whatever it was you were up to. That's because fresh seafood is good for you, and Rubio's has it, so get to eating already what are you wasting time for?!

This is a great, affordable place for a lunch or dinner on the strip - something that is delicious, will fill you up, and won't break the bank.  For $20 you can get a pretty generous serving of fish and chips, and a beer.  What else do you need??  Vinegar?  Tartar sauce!?  INCLUDED!  The atmosphere here is pretty great too - it's a welcome escape from the lights and sounds.  It looks like they have a live band in the evenings, but during lunch time it was busy, but still reasonable volume, and quiet enough that you could just barely make out the vibrations from the roller coaster floors above.  Stop in and tell them Dave sent you.  They won't know who I am, but maybe I can get a reputation there for the next time I'm in town.  I appreciate it.

$5 for a single piece of tuna sashimi with that terrible pre-frozen texture, and minimal flavor.  This might be a good location for hibachi/teppanyaki, but stay away from their sushi/sashimi.

So get this: I'm driving to work, and a big wooden pallet falls off of some idiots pickup truck, and smashes on the highway and splinters everywhere, and me and like, 800 other cars drive through it, because you're going 70 miles an hour, so what are you going to do?  Well, 5 minutes later, "LOW PRESSURE" flashes across my dash, because of course I have a piece of wood jammed through one of my tires.  This place is just down the street from where I work, so I stop in, and they tell me they'll take a look at it.  I sit on a nice little bench outside while I wait (because it's a nice day, because it's Phoenix, and it's a nice day every day), and like, 40 minutes later, they pull my car up, hand me my keys, and tell me it's fixed and thanks for coming in.  No charge or anything.  So moral of the story: Secure the stuff in the back of your truck, and go to Discount Tire because they're awesome, and I'll be buying my tires here in the future.

I've taken my car here half a dozen times for hand-washes, which normally run about $20.  They offer you a discount on gas if you buy a wash, but don't factor that in, because their gas prices are terrible to begin with.  That said, for $20, they do a very decent hand wash.  The attention to detail varies of course, depending on who is actually doing the work, and I don't recall ever seeing the same face twice, but over all, I can't complain, and a few minutes of touch-up myself once I get back home are all it takes to make things look as good as new.  I had a chip in my windshield repaired here, and they did a fabulous job.  I can't even tell where the chip was anymore.  The inside is spacious, cool, has snacks and drinks, and a small market is attached to the building near where you would wait for your car to finish being cleaned.  If you're coming here during lunch, I recommend you walk across the street while you're waiting and pick up a sandwich from Subway - it's super convenient.  They have little picnic tables to sit at while you wait for your car, and a hand-wash takes almost exactly the same amount of time as picking up and eating a 6" sub!

This is a review for the fellas, but ladies - pay attention: Guys, there is only one reason to go to the mission, and it's to take your lover there and show her that you are a man of distinguished tastes and also that you have slightly too much money, but not too much that you're frivolous - just enough extra that you can afford things like expensive tiny tacos and fancy drinks.  When you go to the mission, maybe it's best to eat inside, because the lights are low, and the wood is dark, and it's moody - do you understand what I'm saying?  It's a romantic atmosphere.  So first get some drinks, and I recommend their margaritas, or their tequila mojito, but if you're a guy only order the tequila mojito if your lady already knows that you are a strong lover, because you don't want to send the wrong message, but it's an amazing drink.  Next, it's time for the tacos.  Their menu is pretty thick but it's mostly the cover that's thick, and there aren't actually a lot of pages, so focus on the tacos.  They're sold three at a time, so your will order three tiny tacos, and your lover will order three tiny tacos as well, and then maybe once the food comes, you have an opportunity to swap one.  Or maybe two.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Finally, desert.  Hey, get another drink and get some fried bananas - that's both a suggestive dish, and something delicious, and it lets you both set the mood for what happens after dinner.  That's it.  If you don't like the food or drinks, you don't know what good is, and if you haven't set the mood right, then you have nobody to blame but yourself (or maybe you need to be more discerning about your choice of lovers).  The Mission.

This place is pretty strange. Basically, if you want a place to come work, either alone or in a group, or you want to meet some people who are working on technology or business type things, this is a great place to go, and it seems like it's totally free. It's clean, got a fun atmosphere, people are either quiet and keep to themselves or friendly, and there's basically whatever you need, be it a desk, couch, meeting room with a projector, some books, a vending machine...  pretty nice deal.

Holy cow this store is full of bras. I'm not going to claim to be a bra expert because quite frankly as a man I usually don't wear one, but I can tell you that this store has the bras that you want. Basically any size boobs will find a home here. They've got bras in every color, size, and shape. They've got bras for when you're working out and bras for when you're wearing a t-shirt and bras for strapless dresses - it's the damnedest thing.  Anyway, I wasn't here shopping for me. I came here with my wife, and a word of warning: They only seem to have one chair to sit in while you wait for your special lady to have her breasts holstered. It's bright pink and it's got cushions stuffed on each side of it so that you kind of have to sit there with your legs together awkwardly while people run around waving bras and panties. It's mildly entertaining, I guess, but it's hard to make conversation when you're just a single guy in a bra store.  This location also has some extras. If you want a bright pink cell phone case, they've got those. They also have wings like somebody cut them off of an angel - not sure how expensive those are but like I said, nobody seemed to want to chat with me or ask me if I wanted a pair, so I just stayed quiet. They also have some perfumes and body lotions and face salves and that kind of stuff - pretty good smelling stuff, to be honest.  In closing, if you're a guy, don't expect much here. It's pretty much just ladies clothes and smelly-goods. If you're looking for sexy lingerie for your special woman, then eh - they've got some decent stuff I think.  It's a little hard to gauge that kind of thing when it's on a mannequin with no arms or legs or head and there's some kind of decapitated angel mannequin watching you from behind. I didn't want people to think I was weird or anything, so I didn't study the inventory too hard.

This is pretty simple: These guys have really cheap baked goods. I'm talking buns and hotdog buns for a dollar. I'm talking tiny hostess pies for like, 50 cents or something like that. This place is great. The stuff is close to expired or sell by or whatever but hey, I always look really closely at what I eat, and the stuff we buy here seems to be every bit as fresh as the stuff we pick up at the store, so that's a fact, son. Get your bread and buns and tiny pies here because this place is great, and the people running it are friendly too.

I'm always wary of seafood in land-locked states, but Bluewater Grill is classy and delicious.  This would be a great place to take your lover, or your family, or just get together as a bunch of friends and enjoy the food and some drinks!  The clam chowder is very respectable (I think they have both kinds, but I had the New England) and the fish and chips is nothing to scoff at either.  My lover had the scallops and they were done to perfection.

This place is incredible. I hadn't been to a Wendy's in like, 5 years, and they've completely changed. They used to be fast food places where you walked through the amusement park poles, back and forth, then ordered at the counter and then waited a few steps away, and then the place was basically a shit hole. This Wendy's is completely different. This is seriously the future.  First off, this is probably the most modern building I have ever been in. It's super classy. Like, when I was standing and waiting to order, I felt like I was trashing the place up. People were trying to enjoy their meals and there I was standing around like an idiot because I wasn't even sure if it was a fast food place anymore or if I was supposed to sit down. Anyway I did figure it out because I'm actually pretty smart, and after I ordered, they had this big tv screen that has your name on it, and tells you when your order is up or something like that. It was so incredible I actually don't think I figured out exactly what it was for, because they just give you your food when they're done with it, so there's really not anything else you need to know, but anyway. It's great.  As for the food, I've always found Wendy's to be consistent and delicious, as long as you don't order chicken, and this place is no different. It was great. One of the best times I've had in a long time.

I ordered the ribs, which were featured on their menu as one of their specialties.  They were undercooked to the point where I wasn't sure I should keep eating them.  Don't think about 'fall off the bone' ribs - think about 'gnawing on a piece of raw meat' ribs.  So why did I give this place 4 stars?  The 7 other people in my party all had food that was awesome, and their pretzels and provolone appetizer is worth it.  They seem to hire only attractive, blonde waitresses, which I'm not going to complain about, especially since everyone was very helpful and friendly.  Our waitress helped us choose drinks, food items, and skillfully shot down the table next to us when they tried to hit on her.  Service was prompt, and my glass was always full.  As I said, my ribs were bad.  Really bad.  But again, balance that against the pretzel and provolone appetizer, and amazingly, it was a pretty good meal.  My girlfriend had a sandwich, which was incredible, and the rest of the table really enjoyed their meals.  The atmosphere is fun, although not overly exotic.  They have some large, comfortable booths, great for kicking back in, and they have a lot of outdoor seating with misters to keep things cool.  I'll definitely go back, but I'll order something a little less risky next time.

This is a Starbucks - they have coffee.  I do not drink coffee, as I consider it homeless food, but I do drink tea, which I purchased on this visit.  It was not bad.  Also, the scoundrel who took my order said "May the force be with you" as I left, which I believe is a movie reference.  I appreciate his joviality.

Coming here is a lot like going to the MVD: You get greeted by the people who are unhappy to be working there, and the people who are unhappy to be waiting. You take a seat and have no idea how long you're going to have to wait. Eventually you get called up, and they ask for papers you don't have, or don't understand, and then you get treated like an idiot.  The people who actually performed the service were competent and efficient, and not all together unfriendly, and I sympathize with them, but in the end, I can't imagine anyone going here unless they absolutely have to.  I will not return unless absolutely necessary.

I was very skeptical of this place after my aunt suggested it.  Don't get me wrong - I love music, but how interesting can a museum full of instruments be?  Sure there are a thousand different ways to make music, but most of them I don't really care about, right?  And how do you convey the knowledge of sound and music to someone through an exhibit in a museum?  Well... this place is awesome.  They give you a headset (which is clean), and a receiver, and as you walk up to each exhibit it plays you a clip or 4 that pertain to that particular instrument, artist, or exhibit.  Usually there is a bit playing on a TV that goes along with it, so over the course of an hour, you're watching 20 different clips about tribal dances, Alice Cooper, how pianos are made - whatever.  It works really well, so it quickly becomes very seamless and immersive to experience each exhibit.  This is a great place to take a 6-year-old, because it has a room where they can play, hands-on, with a variety of drums, xylophones, mechanical pianos, etc., but the main part of the museum is entertaining enough that a child seeking knowledge can entertain themselves for hours.  Speaking of hours, I think this is the kind of place you honestly need 2 days to fully explore.  Again, I was skeptical when people told me that, but it's true - unless you just walk through and ignore the clips playing, you're looking at spending two 4-hour days to get through the bulk of it.

I am a programmer, not a painter.  When I walk into a paint store, I am an idiot.  I do not know what gloss I want, or what tools I need.  I only know what colors my designer told me to buy.  This is why Dunn-Edwards gets 5-stars from me.  They don't treat me like a moron.  They help me figure out what I need by asking me what I'm painting, how much, what I already have, showing me options, and helping me figure out what to do.  I've been to this store 4 times now, and each time the experience has been the same.  Helpful people, a short wait while the paint is mixed, and during that time, they help a hand full of (what appear to be) hard-core professional painters, and husband-and-wife do-it-yourselfers.  I come here exclusively now, even when my designer tells me to get a Sherwin Williams color.  They just pull out a Sherwin Williams color book, match it up for me, and boom - job's done.

Buffalo Wild Wings (B-Dubs, to those of us in the know) is my go-to place for wings. Yeah yeah, don't tell me about the hipster joint you frequent that has way better wings - I'm not interested. B-Dubs has consistency, and they have over a dozen sauces. Add to that Tuesday wing nights, and Boneless Thursdays, and you've got a pretty good setup.  This location is at the mall, which is convenient if you want to swing by before or after shopping, and they have a nice outdoor seating area. The restaurant is clean, and service is pretty fast. The last time I went here was with a group of 12, and I thought for sure that would be a disaster, but it was actually very fast and there were no issues.  If you're into sports, they have a ton of televisions, so enjoy that, and if you're not into sports, try to avoid nights with sporting events, because the place will be packed.

Hey everybody, sorry it's taken me so long to review this Panda Express but what can I say - I've been busy lately. If you're not familiar with Panda Express then let me give you the low-down and fill you in on the scoop:  Panda Express is a chain and I personally know that they have locations from Philly to Phoenix because I have been to them first hand and definitely know what I am talking about, but this review is for one SPECIFIC location so listen up. This place has Chinese food, and basically everyone who works there is Chinese I think, so by definition that's pretty authentic. The food quality here has a pretty big range, depending on when you show up. If it's a busy time and lots of people are ordering then it's pretty fresh and delicious, and there's a lot to choose from. If you come at an off-time, then expect that the food has been sitting under their little heat lamp glass armor fort thing for a while, and might not be up to your high standards, but if that's the case I guess you're the one who screwed up because I already warned you about that in my review, you big dungus!  The atmosphere here is actually pretty nice for a fast food joint. It's on the corner of a shopping center and there's lots of windows and good seating so if you're going to hang out, you can just look out the window at the people walking by, and there's a McDonalds just outside and you can make faces at the people in the drive thru.  As for the service, it's pretty average. The people are nice, and they let you sample things if you want, but nobody's ever been particularly excited to serve me Chinese food there, which I guess makes sense because I wouldn't be excited to do that either.

Let me explain something to you: I am a man. I like to eat MEAT, and I don't want some fru-fru ingredients that I've never heard about. Don't try to serve me brocolini - just give me broccoli. Or better yet, just give me a small tree because I am a man and when I eat, I mean business.  Due to this, I avoided the Pomegranate Cafe for a long time, because what am I going to do with a tofu burrito? That's not real food. And a taco made with walnut meat? Walnuts aren't meat - they're wood. I don't want that.  Anyway, my wife talked me into coming here, and I have to take everything back. This place has serious flavor - flavor that would scare lesser men. I had a burrito without any meat in it - not even eggs, and it was both filling, and really, really delicious. Also, they have some pretty wild deserts here, so even if you're not willing to try bread made of cauliflower, try the chocolate cake, or even better - the banana cake.  Do know that they are slow - like... extremely slow. If you have the time, it's worth it, but don't come here if you've got somewhere to be afterwards.  Also, they have fake bacon, which is nothing like real bacon. I'm not saying it's bad - just don't order it if you're like me and expect what you're used to.  Other than that, enjoy! And I recommend sitting outside - they've got a lovely patio and a basket full of squirt bottles to ward off any adventurous birds.

Ok let me start this review out by telling you like it is: This is a great place to come.  They even figured out how to make the building correctly, because the 'IN' door and the 'OUT' door are separated so your dog that's crazy from being at the vet and having a thermometer poked into its butt doesn't have to interact wtih dogs that just got there and don't know about the thermometer thing yet.  Also, I only talked to one vet, but these guys know their stuff, and they don't try to sell you a bunch of extra junk or smooth talk you into leaving with a bunch of doge food and putting flea medicine on yourself or anything - it's all on the level.  The vet we visited knew how to handle dogs and how do I know?  Because my dog is a great dane and she weighs 120 pounds and if you mess with her she'll eat your face!  And the vet was playing with her on the floor within 5 minutes and nobody's face was being eaten!  He's like a pro!  And he looked at her and checked her teeth and even her blood and everything went smooth.  Basically stop wasting your time if you go to another vet - why don't you do some research first and figure out where the best place is because it's here!

I work a block away from Salem's, and I eat there twice a week.  Don't be fooled by the cheap, cafeteria style seating - everything at Salem's is incredible, whether you want a burger and fries, or more traditional Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  They have a large menu (posted above the counter) to order from, as well as about 20 feet of hot food waiting to be dished up from the counter.  Vegetarians have options such as vegetable curry, spinach, chickpeas, and hummus, but if you're like me, you want some meat!  Go ahead and try a lamb gyro, beef gyro, or some chili chicken.  They also have a great beverage selection, if you're into specialty sodas, juices, milks, or Snapple.  Salem's isn't the classiest joint in the strip, but like I said, I'll take it multiple times a week!  The prices are great when you consider how large the serving sizes are, but healthy eaters can get smaller dishes as well.

I have been told that in Spanish, the name 'Secreto' means 'The Secret'.  I can tell you first hand that this is absolutely true.  I have driven by this place probably 100 times, but had never bothered to stop because it simply didn't have the curb appeal.  Well let me tell you something - this is the best Mexican I've found in Ahwatukee, and I've tried them all now.  It's getting 4 stars, because there's nothing extraordinary, but at the same time, everything is good.  The margaritas are good, the food is fresh, with large portions, and the prices are reasonable.  Our waiter seemed very comfortable in the joint, so I'm assuming he was the owner/manager, and he was attentive, friendly, and fun.  This is our new Mexican place.  We'll be back soon!

This is a sushi joint in an airport, so you have to drop your expectations just a little bit. Now normally I am fine with low expectations, but the prices here are what you'd expect to pay for pretty decent sushi - not frozen fish. No disrespect to the chef, since the menu was fun and the rolls were creative, but charging $15 for a roll made with frozen tuna isn't gonna earn you a high review.  Expect grocery-store sushi taste.  This is a great place for people watching, which almost earns it 3 stars.  But not quite.

This is a pretty straight-forward joint.  Walk in, self-serve from a dozen different flavors of frozen yogurt and a couple dozen toppings, from Nerds candy to chocolate to fruit, pay by the weight of your food, and either have a seat at their bar, outside seating, or take it with you.  I give it four stars because the staff was very helpful, and the flavor of the frozen yogurt was actually pretty good.  This is probably a good place to bring the kids, but I wouldn't recommend it as a stop on your date night.

Barro's is fast-food pizza.  Step up to the counter, order a slice or two, maybe some wings, and you're good for lunch.  It's cheap, delicious, and fills you up.  The staff are always friendly, and seating has never been a problem.

Do not come here for lunch.  The atmosphere is modern and fresh, and the people are nice, but you will not be able to eat real food for any reasonably price.  They were selling shaved ham for $35 an ounce.  I don't know about you guys but I am a fully grown adult and that means I would have to spend over $350 for a real meal here.  Yeah, there are other cheaper options, but I didn't come for tiny strange dishes of things I can't identify - I came because they were famous for their black footed pig.  So much for that.  I tried it, and it's good, but at those prices, I hope you enjoy it a lot more than I did.  Their dinner options might be more 'normal' or filling - I don't know, but like I said, don't show up for lunch.

TCBY stands for 'The Country's Best Yogurt'.  Is it really?  I do not know, because I have only had frozen yogurt at 4 or 5 different places in my life.  But, is it good?  Yep.  This is an appropriately small shop, tucked away in a location surrounded by other delicious food options (Chipotle and Jimmy Johns, anyone?  Also Indian, breakfast, hippy, etc), so it's a great place to stop by after dinner if you're looking for an inexpensive, cool, desert.  There are a few little tables, or you can just take your food outside and hang out in the shade if it's not the heat of summer.  The guy working there was friendly, offered samples, and had suggestions.

Let me address this first: Where the heck are all the herbs?! I don't know - but the food is still great.  We came here for brunch, and the atmosphere is perfect for a lazy morning in Scottsdale. The seating is large and comfortable, and there is ample outdoor seating. Even if you're indoors, it seems they like to open the place up, and the sounds of shoppers and birds outside really add to the experience. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food, which is excellent, and they come up with some fairly unique offerings for brunch, but also offer traditional options if you're just in the mood for eggs and bacon.  Regardless, if you're in town visiting, want to take the family out for a meal, are having a lazy day, or want to take your special lady somewhere classy and fun, this fits the bill for everything.

I have only one thing to say about this place: They have a pretzel fondu. Get that as your appetizer, and don't order your meal until you've tried it. The discerning palette will, after tasting the pretzel fondu, decide to place a second order of pretzel fondu for the main meal. Nothing quiet finishes off a meal like a desert of pretzel fondu, so I recommend that for desert as well. Each course of pretzel fondu can be paired with a different beer from their ample selection.  Follow these instructions and you will not be disappointed. I can not speak to any of their other food since I have not wasted my time trying it.

I am not a fan of baseball.  I think it is a terrible game, and a waste of time.  I have been to three baseball games in my life, and it's basically just a bunch of guys standing around wishing they could go home.  It amazes me that people will pay money to sit and watch people standing around when you can do that for free at any government work site.  That said, Salt River Fields is awesome, and I had a fantastic time here.  All kinds of food options, drink options, shade, sun, souvenirs - and all in an environment much less crowded than stadiums I have been in before, and much cleaner.  You could drop your food on the ground and then pick it up and eat it.  My only word of warning, I ended up parking pretty far out in a rock/dirt field, so don't bring your new Lamborghini.

This is a fantastic place. The flavor is real. The combinations they work into their sandwiches and breakfasts are a delight to the palette. The atmosphere is modern and clean, and the people are pretty nice. Two words of advice:  1. Don't get the buffalo chicken wrap. It's average - maybe even below average. Everything else here is above average or awesome. If you really are in the mood for a buffalo chicken wrap, go elsewhere.  2. They usually aren't fast. If you're on your lunch break, and want to make it back in an hour, you might want to look elsewhere.  Not saying they can't do that, but when they get busy, they get slow.

I live near this joint, so I've both eaten there at least a dozen times, and ordered delivery a few times.  Let me tell you something: this is both a pretty good pizza joint, and not a bad Italian joint in general!  First off, they have a sandwich which I believe is called the Grilled Da Vinci - it's awesome.  It's enough to fill up even a seriously hungry dude (like myself) and delicious from end to end.  The bread is perfect, the meat is fresh and tender, the italian dressing is fantastic (ask for some extra italian dressing to dip the sandwich into).  Ah!  Mamma Mia!  The pizza is pretty fantastic too.  All of the ingredients, fresh, plentiful - what else do you want?  The atmosphere in here is good.  It's not too classy that I feel like I have to dress up, but it's classy enough that you can take a date here or show up for a couple drinks and just enjoy yourself.

I don't like breakfast places.  When I sit down at a table and someone asks me if I want coffee, I'm immediately disgusted.  If I wanted dirty bean water, I'd sip the mud-sludge out of a gutter on Via de Ventura.  I also don't crave eggs or grits or toast.  I am a man, and I am powered by steak, and burgers, and alcohol.  I also hate the atmosphere of breakfast places.  Sunny, and open, with weird art on the walls - no.  So that said, my co-worker talked me into going here, and it is awesome.  Yeah you go in and it's all sunny and there are a bunch of families there, and grandma and grandpa took little junior to get some waffles, and they try to serve you coffee as if you're a dirty hobo, but the food... hoooooly cow, man.  The food is delicious.  I'm talking about thick strips of bacon - as thick as a strip of beef jerky, and cooked to perfection: crispy, but not burnt.  I grabbed an Eggs Benedict with hash browns, and the entire plate figuratively slid down my throat.  Nothing was greasy or oily, but it had to be unhealthy as delicious as it was.  But it did not feel unhealthy! The orange juice was freshly squeezed (I had a seed in mine!  That's authentic!) and delicious.  The service was fast (for a breakfast place), and reasonably courteous.  I'll be back.

I'm going to keep this review short because I have no other cheese shops to compare this one too, but I can't imagine anything else I'd want.  On Saturdays they have bread from some local bread place that's great.  On every day, they have just a ton of cheeses and meats and they're always really willing to let you taste things to figure out what you like or what you need.  They're really knowledgable about wine and cheese and meat and beer, but they don't act superior or anything, so when I walk in there and have NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING they are super helpful and everything ends up great and I walk out of there happy.  You can stop in for lunch or dinner or whatever but most of the time I'm just coming in for some bread and cheese and meat, but it's a good atmosphere either way.  It's nice to enjoy their outdoor seating and look at the people going to yoga or whatever and just have a good time.

Every time I shop here, I swear I won't come back, but I always do, because I don't want to deal with the crowd at Fry's. The people here are really nice and helpful as well, so I don't fault them for anything. This place can NOT keep their shelves stocked appropriately.  I assume it's because they're not moving product fast enough due to the Fry's across the street, but it's extremely common for me to not be able to buy something due to it simply sitting on the shelf, expired. I just got back from this store 10 minutes ago, and their pre-packaged tomatoes were expired by 5 days (all of them), and of the yogurts I tried to buy, two kinds were all expired as well.  I check everything now, but I've purchased tortillas, pickles, and cheese here multiple times without realizing the products were expired, and not just a little bit expired - months.  They also have the worst produce. Bananas are terrible here - either totally green or too far brown to last through the week. Sometimes they have good avocados, but sometimes they've got 2 full displays with just bad fruit in them.  As I said, the people here are great, and the location is clean and orderly, and I keep coming back because it's quiet and relaxed, unlike the Fry's across the street, but seriously, if you don't check every item you put into your cart, you're going to be buying something expired.

This place has good food, and a great selection of beers. They even had a Hefeweizen on tap that was brewed in-house!  Do you have any idea how rare that is in this day of hipsters and IPA's?! Rare.  The big thing to know about this place is that it is more than dog-friendly. It is actually dog-occupied. Like, if you go here, you will see some dogs. Obviously this is a good thing, and there were some pretty good dogs when I went. There was one dog that was a bulldog and he was really round and stout like somebody put legs on a giant meatloaf. There was also a skinny dog that was wide-eyed and crazy looking. I give each of those dogs a rating of 4-stars as well. If you have a fine dog, I suggest you bring it with you, and I think they even had complimentary dog treats.

This is my favorite place to order lunch from during the work week. To be clear: Their delivery people are disrespectfully fast. I have ordered two sandwiches, hung up the phone, and had a delivery person waiting for me in less than 5 minutes. If you want to witness this behavior yourself, I suggest you eat in. There are delivery drivers literally running in and out of the place like somebody dropped it in the middle of an olympic relay race.  As for the food - it's exactly Jimmy John's. Good sandwiches, with the focus probably being their unique bread. It's not fancy, but it gives them their signature taste. The ingredients are always fresh, and as I said - unreasonably fast.

I don't care if it's a chain - America's is fantastic.  First off, they have beer, margaritas, and tequila. That's great. Secondly, they're fast.  Like, bring a group for lunch at 12:00 and get back with time to spare before your 1:00 meeting. Third, they're friendly and helpful.  Don't get me wrong, if you go in there like a big fat jerk and start complaining about things, I hope they punch you in the throat, but if you place your order with a smile, they take it with a smile, and check in you while you're eating to make sure you don't need salsas or chips, and get your garbage out of your way. Finally, the food is pretty good.  Incredible?  No.  But tasty and fresh, and they don't charge you an arm and a leg.  I get a burrito, chips, and salsa, and spend about $6.

BBQ is not generally a classy man's meal, and Rudy's does not look like a very classy joint, so I was skeptical walking into the place.  There are lots of picnic-table style seatings, some red and white checkerboard table cloths, and a trough full of bottles of beer and soda, surrounded by ice.  We walked up to the counter to order, and from that second, it was a 5-star experience.  The girl at the counter was really friendly, and gave us samples since we had never been there before, so we could figure out what we wanted.  The cook/bbq'er/meat cutter behind the counter was having a good time, yelling back for help whenever people were waiting, and getting excited whenever someone new came in and wanted to try samples.  The food was absolutely amazing.  I mean, don't get me wrong, it's BBQ, so don't expect exotic plating, but if you want delicious meat on a bun or baked potato, and want to walk away full and satisfied, this is the joint.  It was too hot when we went, but in nicer weather it looks like they open up all of the walls to the outside, which I'm sure makes the atmosphere that much better.  I can imagine returning when it's nicer out, grabbing a few brews, and killing an hour just sitting in the breeze and getting fat off of pulled pork.  There was only one thing I didn't like about Rudy's, and that was the country music playing the entire time, but hey - if you like country music, then YEEEEE HAAAWW GOOD BUDDY go ahead and enjoy that, and even if you don't, it wasn't enough for me to knock a star off of the rating.

The flavor is real.  I'm giving Del Frisco's Grille four stars, even though I doubt I will return.  The food was absolutely fabulous, and the wine selection was epic.  We were there during a slow time of day, and the waitress talked to us a little and was fun.  I would definitely say that this is a 'classy' establishment, however, and had it been a busier time of day, would have felt very under-dressed.  Check out my picture for a pepper burger and fries, which I highly recommend.  Their tuna taco appetizer is also perfectly done - crispy shells that almost make it a messy explosion, but somehow manage to keep all of the deliciousness together.  All in all, I would recommend Del Frisco's Grille for a classy date or to announce your engagement, but I wouldn't just stop by after shopping.

A trendy roof-top bar atop a trendy hotel with a pool either in or next to the bar (I assume for hotel guests only, but am not sure).  There is a lot of eye candy up here, service is slow, and it's a beautiful view in a clean, cool environment.  There are a number of large booth/couch type tables which face the rest of the bar for people-watching.  If you want to relax, have a few drinks, and people-watch, this is a great place.  If you're in a rush, or expect somebody to wait on you, go elsewhere.

I come here every 3-weeks or so for dog food. It takes me less than 5 minutes every single time to get in, grab a giant bag of food, and get out. Nobody ever hassles me, and checkout is quick and painless.  It's not a huge store, but they seem to have about a hundred kinds of dog food. They also stock lots of pet pillows, cat-tower-things, and pet treats. I can't speak to anything else.

This place is almost an hour from my house, but I would never take my dog anywhere else, for daycare or boarding.  The staff is very friendly, and they obviously like what they do there.  The facility is very clean and modern, and they offer rooms with actual beds, which is important to us since our great dane doesn't fit particularly well on most dog beds.  You're going to pay a little more here, but I'm comfortable leaving town knowing that my dog is in good hands, and having a good time.

This is one of the strangest places I have ever been in my life.  Let me cut to the chase: The food is on a conveyor belt and it moves around and if you want it, you have to grab it off of the conveyor belt. They have normal tables too and a normal menu, but it seems like that's just for people without the agility to get the real food, or maybe they came in and were too embarrassed to sit at the conveyor belt, but also too embarrassed to leave so they just acted like everything was normal and sat at a normal table, but guess what people: IT ISNT NORMAL AND EVERYONE KNOWS IT.  Also, when we went there was a lot of smoke in the place, and the lady running the joint was very appologetic and said that the fan in the kitchen had broken and that they were getting it repaired immediately, but honestly I think she was trying to distract people and increase the difficulty of getting the food. I don't know why she would do this because she seemed like a very nice woman, but I just have a feeling. Either way, it's gonna take more than some smoke to keep me from getting food when I'm hungry! We sat at the conveyor belt bar thing and the food came around and before I knew it I had snagged 7 plates and was feeling kind of funny from all the saki and smoke and it was a great time. To make things easier every plate was $2 so the math was east to do to figure out if I should keep eating more food or not.  So this place was pretty fun. It's not sushi like at a really good sushi place, but it's not stale old sushi either. I'd say it's a step above sushi you'd get in the grocery store, and the price is reasonable, and holy cow what a time.

Ok, so let me tell this like it is.  This is a food truck.  To me, the only thing that means is that I will never be able to find it again because it's going to drive off somewhere else obscure and that's the end of things.  I know there is a lot of hype right now with food trucks and how cool they are and how they're trendy and they're better than traditional food establishments because they are run by independent people trying to make a living and owning land is a sin or whatever LOOK BUDDY I'm just here to put the food in my mouth, so that's all I'm judging this based on, ok?  So I walked up to the food truck and took the food and tasted it.  I got their signature dumplings, and Imperial Chicken (which the guy then proceeded to call 'Street Treats' which simultaneously made it much more appealing, and much less appealing).  The dumplings were pretty good, especially considering that it's hard to find good dumplings these days and most people's are just those frozen packaged ones that they then reheat.  I'm talking about lots of meat, tender dough, and seasoning that sticks with you for like, the next 12 hours whether you like it or not.  The Street Treats weren't as great.  Basically it was chicken with seasoning and a little bit of marinade that left a bit of delicious oily-style juice in the bottom of the tray.  Not that they were bad, but I am a man who likes to eat pieces of the chicken that I can identify, like the wing or the thigh or the breast or the face.  It wasn't immediately apparent to me that the chicken was strips of thighs, resulting in some inconsistency from bite to bite.  The service was good, the people were friendly, and the prices were decent.  I'm giving it three stars (A-Ok!), because it FELT like a 4-star experience, but only because it was novel and fleeting.  If it were a restaurant that I could just walk back to for lunch today, would I?  Eh, maybe.  Maybe not.  So I guess what I'm saying is if you happen to see this food truck (which is probably why you're looking at the reviews), give it a shot and try the dumplings.

As a lot of other reviewers have said, the location of this place is a big part of what makes it great.  There aren't a lot of sushi options in this area, so it's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  There's a lot to like about Ginban.  It's a new place, so the staff isn't quite seasoned yet, but they are friendly, and do their best to make you comfortable.  They have a very reasonable selection of drinks, and about 10 different varieties of sake.  The sushi was outstanding.  This is the first place I have had tempura banana on a roll, and I highly recommend it.  Try the 'Banana Mama Roll' and you won't be disappointed (unless you don't like banana).  I also appreciate their desert options, including tempura banana ice cream and mochi.  We had the mochi, and it was served at perfect temperature.  The only thing I'll speak poorly of at this place, and what kept it from being a 5-star review, is the music was terrible.  Country music I'll accept at a BBQ joint, but this is a sushi bar.  Either give us some modern music, or something with asian flair, or just ambient music - anything but country!

Since my original review I've become a regular here.  The music situation has improved a little bit, but what makes this my 5-star sushi place is definitely just the delicious, quality food.  Whether you're going for fish, shrimp, or sea urchin, the freshness and taste can't be beat in the Ahwatukee area.  Check out their website for happy hour times if you want a real deal, but stop by any time for delicious sushi, sashimi, and saki.  I particularly recommend the sushi bar salad, which is a simple and delicious pairing of cucumber and crab, or any of their roles which include banana tempura, which are all excellent!

If you've been going somewhere else for sushi then what the heck are you doing?!  You're going to the wrong place ya big dungus!  Ginban sushi is the place to go and let me tell you why.  I've been here over a dozen times now and that's a lot of times considering I've only been in the area for like 8 months.  Before I came to Phoenix I've been all over the world and I've eaten sushi meats from coast to coast and let me tell you something - I don't know a lot about sushi but I know when I put something in my mouth if it tastes good or not, and that's why I'm writing this review because if you want some sushi meats that you put in your mouth and you like the way it tastes then just come here, what are you waiting around for?!  First let me tell you about the owner, ok?  He's a great guy and he's a sushi master.  The menu has a lot of great sushis on it.  Maybe you want some rolls, right?  Well then what the heck - just get one of the rolls with banana tempura in it and you're gonna love it!  Or maybe you want some fresh fish so just order some fish or ask them what they recommend and he'll give you the best that he recommends.  I don't know why I have to explain this to you, just do it already.  Or maybe you're a guy and you're like "Oh I don't want some sushi because I like cooked food" ok then big man, just order off of the kitchen menu and they'll bring you some sushi meats cooked and some rice and some tempura shrimp or whatever you order, it doesn't matter because it's all good.  Ok finally maybe you're here already and you're looking at Yelp because it's time for desert.  And maybe you're at Ginban with your special lady and it's a romantic evening, so you want to know how to close things our and seal the deal (Ladies this is a good place to take your man also if you want him to know that you're the boss and you wear the pants when it comes to picking where to eat and you're not going to settle for Wendy's or Taco Bell anymore) so just listen to me and do what I tell you: order the mango salad, and a peach saki for desert, and share it.  The Mango Salad isn't on the menu and I hope the owner doesn't get pissed about me saying it, but order it anyway.  I don't know how much is costs all I know is that it's real sushi (like maybe it's crab salad and tuna salad inside of a mango wrap) and it's delicious and it's real food, not some fru-fru desert that a gypsy tries to sell you when it's checkout time at an Italian restaurant.  And the peach saki is the perfect sweet way to end the meal so that when you give that goodnight kiss you taste like peach and not like whatever else you ate, and just have a good time, ok?  Because it's a great place to eat some sushi.  Stop going somewhere else you're wasting your money and you look like a big dringus!  Look at the pictures that's actually what the food looks like and it tastes as good as it looks!

America's is a chain, and it's a good chain - don't get me wrong, but this place gets 5 stars for a different reason.  There's a guy here (I assume it's the manager, but I could be wrong) who just really takes care of people. Like, he's friendly, comes to check on you while you're eating, gets you things if you need them - it's just a higher level of service.  Hell - it's better customer service than I get at many classier places.  I've only been here like, 3 times, but he's always there and helpful!  Anyway, America's is awesome (try the chips and guac, and an Al Pastor taco), and I recommend it, and this location is awesome.

The customer service at this b-dubs is unreasonably good.  They're quick, friendly, and frequently check to make sure you don't need more wings or drinks.  From any seat in the house you can see at least a dozen TV's.  Unfortunately, they're all showing various types of sportsball, so there's not much to watch.

We sat outdoors, which was very nice. I don't know what my wife had, because I was too busy devouring my bacon-filled macaroni and cheese to look at anything or talk to anyone. It was incredible. And I know cheese+bacon is just a no-brainer, but it was seriously better than expected.  The service was good - nothing fantastic but good. The waitress tried to pawn Blue Moon off on me as a hefeweizen (which it is not), so don't expect the best beer selection, but still a great time. It looks like things might get fun in the evenings outdoors, with some kind of outdoor games.

I have only found two sushi places in Pittsburgh which I consider acceptable, and this is one of them. For starters, these guys really know what they're doing. Yeah they have some American-style rolls that are just deep fried and sauced all to hell (not saying that's not delicious), but they also have a lot of really fresh, interesting menu options, and their sashimi is exquisitely fresh and delicious.  Ooh - they seem to have a reasonably large selection of saki too, so that's nice.  It's not a very large place, and when we stopped by for lunch it was pretty packed, so maybe plan around that - I'm not sure.  But service was fast and everybody was exceptionally friendly - nothing arrogant. I'd definitely stop in again!

I have been looking for a good burger place since I moved to Phoenix and this is the first one to fit the bill.  Let's just talk about burgers for a minute: When you're burgin' (meaning you have an insatiable hunger for a burger which comes from within), what do you want?  A third of a pound of meat?  Half a pound?  A pound?  These are all options at Notorious.  What about a turkey burger?  Well, then you're probably a communist, but they have turkey burgers too!  What about a bun?  Do you like a standard, bun?  Or maybe you're a healthy person and you want a whole wheat bun?  Or maybe you're in the mood for something more exotic like a pretzel bun?  Notorious has these varieties of buns.  So you've got your meat, your bun, and it's time for the toppings.  At Notorious I'm talking about some premium toppings.  I'm talking about aged cheddar, bacon ketchup, rich chipotle pepper sauce to spice it up, and avocado to cool it down.  We're not done yet people, because don't just bring me a burger on a plate because I need some SIDES.  Now a lot of people don't like cole slaw, and I respect that, because it's usually not good (PRO TIP: Load it up with pepper and you can get your daily helping of slaw and pepper at the same time, even if the taste isn't so great).  At Notorious, they have some magical slaw.  Is it the best cole slaw I have ever tasted?  Probably.  And they give you a nice helping with a burger.  Hey maybe throw it on your burger and go Pittsburgh style!  But also give their fries a try.  They're not perfect, but they're delicious with a side of bacon ketchup.  All of that for maybe $13, which isn't bad for a fancy lunch, and is damn good for a delicious dinner burger.  So what's the catch?  This place does get a little busy, and it's usually full of square looking bankers in awful suits.  But hey they're just loving their burgers just like you, so get in line and chow down.

Cuttlefish does three things perfectly: 1) Food - just outstanding.  We sat in the bar area and just picked things off of the happy hour menu. The Fish Tacos? Perfect.  Big pieces of fish (but appropriate for the tortilla size), crisp, fresh cabbage, perfect seasoning... mmm.  We tried the three types of oysters they had, and they ended up being so fresh and delicious that I wasn't adding horseradish to them - just fresh delicious oysters.  We had the smoked fish board, which was equally incredible, with this rich creamy mascarpone that just made every other soft cheese I've ever eaten feel unnecessary.  And the surf and turf skewers.  Just awesome.  I recommend every bit of it. 2) Atmosphere - Cuttlefish is the sister restaurant of Notorious Burgers/Kitchen next door, and both of these places are just super classy, with really interesting, engaging (but not distracting) decor, that makes the entire experience just fun.  The oyster bar is surrounded by chopped-off bikes, which I will absolutely be back to sit on and consume unreasonable amounts of oysters.  The divider between the private dining area and the rest of the restaurant is inspired, the booths are comfortable, large (I'm a skinny dude but I like a lot of space), and feel luxurious - not cheap.  And the music really sets the mood.  This would be a great place for a date (ask and make sure he/she likes seafood first, of course). 3) Customer Service - I stopped here yesterday after spending all day traveling.  Just looking at the place from the outside, you know it's a classy joint, and after spending 6 hours cooped up in a plane, I'm still wearing jeans and a t-shirt, I kind of expect to walk in here and be treated like a second-class citizen.  Totally NOT the case.  I might be a common man, but I had nothing but smiles, service, and help from the moment I stepped through the door.  I've been to their sister restaurant many times, so I don't think this is the result of good management and smart hiring - not a one-off experience.  The people who work here are helpful, respectful, friendly, and generally just pretty damn cool.  Everybody seems to be happy, and that makes all the difference.  Anyway, if that was too long to read: It's a freakin' awesome place.  Go there.  Preferably with someone you want to impress.

This is a very chill place, and when the weather is nice and you can sit outside, or they open the place up - it's excellent.  They have a respectable variety in the brews they carry, and the menu isn't huge, but it has enough options to satisfy any palette.  BUT... that is not the big reason to go here.  The real reason is...  They have freakin' birds all over the place!  They have all of these big cages outdoors, and inside them are these giant birds, like a parrot, and a big white one with crazy eyes, and then a bunch of little birds come to hang out with the big ones! It's a bird party what are you missing out for, you dingus!?  Go check it out!

The portions are small, the food is expensive, and the seating options could be pretty bad.  The only up-side to this place is that you can grab a beer before your flight.  The quality of the food isn't bad - but it's an airport.  They're charging you a lot for a little, and it's because they can get away with it.  Also the person who waited on me seemed grumpy, which I can understand given the setup they have there.

Papa Chevo's is the real deal. I went there early in the morning to get some breakfast burritos. Not a lot of places are open early in the morning but Papa Chevo gets out of bed early, and you better believe it. I got two burritos - one with sausage and another with chorizo!  The lady behind the counter asked me if I wanted any sauce, and I said "I dunno. Ok" and she gave me two different sauces to try, each one was like a spicy salsa but different flavors - they were pretty good.  The real question is how were the burritos though, not the sauces.  They were pretty good. Not dry, not too messy - pretty freakin' good.  I don't know what Papa Chevo looks like, but I assume he made them by hand - it didn't look like they had the kind of machinery around that they'd need to do it automatically.  So here's the deal: just go and try it out - what are you sitting around for?!

Guys I'm here to tell you that Firehouse Subs is a great place to go if you just want to eat a sandwich. The place was made by firemen so of course they know how to make a good sandwich because these guys aren't messing around! My dad was a fireman and I know that when you're putting out a fire or trying to help a guy that was run over on his motorcycle, you don't want to be hungry because you had a Lean Cuisine for lunch! You have to eat like a real man!  They've got a ton of sandwiches with basically anything you want, but they have mostly hot sandwiches, so if you want a cold sandwich maybe you should go somewhere else.  Also this location has a selection of over 20 hot sauces, and they're labeled with numbers so you know which ones are the hottest! So put a bunch of hot sauce on your sandwich and eat the whole thing because that's what you need to do to be ready for a fire!  This place is right across the street from a firehouse too so maybe if you're lucky you can see the fire trucks go on a mission but even if they don't, there's a mural on the wall that shows the firehouse so you can look at that too!

This is a great place.  Good atmosphere, good food, decent prices, and friendly people. It's not the best sushi in Ahwatukee (Ginban is still number 1) but if you're in the area, this is a great place with chefs who know what they're doing and offer some creative options.

To be clear: I did not eat at Sir Veza's The Big Restaurant Attached To The Mall. I ate at Sir Veza's Taco Garage The Place In The Food Court Because I'm Cheap.  I'm not a business analyst, but what it looks like they've done is built their restaurant right next to the food court, so they share a wall, and then carved out one of the food court sections so now it's like the restaurant has a closet that they take orders from and bring you food. You can sit there, in the food court, with the rest of the food court eaters. The food wasn't super fast, which is great because that makes me believe they are making it fresh, and "ho doggy" it did seem to be pretty fresh. It wasn't slow either though. I didn't feel like I was sitting around waiting or anything. It took the appropriate amount of time.  I ordered a Sir Noran Hot Dog or something like that. I think the name is supposed to be a play on words because the name of the place starts with 'Sir', but I don't get it. It doesn't really matter though. I'm ok if they want to call it that. Anyway, I ordered it, and it was delicious. If you like hotdogs, you'll either like this, or you're a liar.  The ambiance of the food court in general is a wonderfully grounding experience. One of the things I love about the Chandler Fashion Square Mall is how diverse the shoppers are. You can sit in the food court for an hour, and absolutely make things up, and they'll inevitably walk through the place. Ugly kid on stilts. Totally overweight woman with 3 children. Guy who looks like the monopoly guy. Just any kind of person.  Overall I'm giving Sir Veza's Taco Garage a total of four freakin' stars, because the food was delicious, and the service was great, but compared to the cool taco-garage feel of the counter, going back and sitting in the mall food court means you don't get that full-on Sir Veza's experience. Well then, why did I eat at the food court instead of going to the restaurant? Well I'm not a genius, so I don't know. 4 stars is still really good, so don't worry about it.

Have you ever fantasized about being trapped in a room with your friends or coworkers and having to solve puzzles in order to escape while you're monitored on camera and timed? God knows I do - all the freakin' time. Well if so, this is the place to go. It's totally awesome.  I can't say a ton without giving things away, but basically it's this: You go with some other people, they 'lock' you in a room (you're not really locked, for safety reasons), and then you have to solve puzzles to escape.  If they see you're getting stuck, they might ask you if you need a hint. The puzzles are both mental and physical, and it's a blast.  As of my writing this, they only have one room, so you really can only go once, but they're working on a second room which I think they said has a log-cabin feel, which would be cool.  The entire thing is very well done, and it's moody, and super cool.  Definitely go.
