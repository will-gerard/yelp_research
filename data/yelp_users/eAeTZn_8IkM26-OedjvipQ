We live right up the street from Arrivederci and while it is way too nice to eat there too often, it is a treat every time we do.   The staff is great. Real old school nice service.   Warning, like any good Italian restaurant ... They love to get you liquored up :)   Luckily we can walk home from here and so we do indulge from time to time in a wine fest here.   The food is great. All the sauces are fresh and homemade. The eggplant rollatini is delicious ... The gnocchi is the best I've had and you have to love the drinks.   Great place to take a date or just pop in for a nice dinner on a Tuesday. You will be welcomed with a smile and always leave with one on your face.   4 out of 5. It really is closer to 4.5 out of five.   Jason

This is my favorite place to eat in Arizona and I'm a native. I've been here almost 32 years and I just love coming here.  I came here once with my wife and then several months later with some coworkers. I had the same waiter (great guy with the pony tail) and he remembered what my wife had ordered months back. I couldn't believe it.   The bar is top notch. They make the best Manhattan in the valley.  This is real Italian food folks. Of course there are some negative reviews because well, some people just like The Olive Garden. You can't please everyone. If you like going to The Olive Garden, this place isn't for you. If you like to feel like you just discovered a gem in Sicily for the first time, definitely come to Tomaso's.  It's nice enough to celebrate Valentine's Day or an Anniversary here, but also cool enough to go with a group of guys to get some drinks and eat for a few hours ... Yes, you can literally spend hours here eating and drinking. They always make you feel like family.   Jason

Great hidden gem for vegetarians + the best service in town.   While we veggie folk know that most Asian places will substitute tofu for any dishes in lieu of meat, we also know it is hard to find a place where the tofu isn't a crappy tasting substitute that they don't really want to serve ...   This is not the case at Ling and Louie's. The fried tofu in just about everything and in every sauce is delicious. I kick it way up the spicy meter with 2 or 3 dishes of chili paste and mix that in with my (off the menu) Evil Jungle Tofu. It is so good that I am actually happy that the portions are too large for me to finish. I can nosh on this dish all night ... well after I've left the restaurant.   I'm a pretty simple beer and whiskey drinker, but I my wife loves the great drinks that they make here. They come in blue, red, purple, and green ... I don't know what's in them, but she loves them.  The servers treat you like family and are always extra nice to our little one. They don't put a hot plate in front of a 2 year old like most restaurants and have a vast selection of items for the mini me in your life. The staff is always quick to grab a high chair a few crayons and a fun kids menu.    Every time I've been, it's busy ... but not uncomfortably so. We're always sat quickly and never rushed. The decor is cool and it's casual enough for the entire family and nice enough to impress a date.   Don't miss out on this one. A real 5 out of 5.   - Jason -

"I can't move the sun."   Second time here. First time we just had very rude service. This time it was one of the worst I've ever experienced.  We were seated in the bar area. Restaurant not too busy. Plenty of other seats. The sun was blinding my friend's wife and it finally was too much. We very politely asked to be moved and it was an ordeal. 5 or 6 people involved and ultimately the short haired blonde woman said rudely,   "We can't move the sun. It will be gone in 5 minutes."   Wow. I know, right? I can't believe we stayed after that. There were so many empty seats not in the sun. Just her attitude was really unusually bad and I'm as laid back a guy as they come.  Then one of the 4 entrees was wrong. Not a huge deal. They were nice and quickly brought out the correct dish.  At the beginning of our meal I ordered a jalape√±o cucumber margarita. Supposed to be delicious. Once our meal was over I figured they just forgot about it. No big deal. As we were about to get the check, the same short haired blonde women brought the drink. This is 15 minutes later mind you. She knew I was going to ask her to take it back.  "Really???" she said as rude as they come with a loud gasp and a sigh.   She did take the drink back.  Then I asked the same short haired blonde woman for our check. She said ... "GOOD." - Wow, I know. She said good when I asked nicely for our check. I said, "Excuse me?" and she then said quietly, "Sure."  I can't believe it. Still left 20% tip as the main waitress was nice and it wasn't her fault that her surrounding staff were all the rudest people you'll meet.   The food is great , but I will never go back there again. You couldn't pay me to go back again. I love mexican food , like to tip nicely, and live up the street. What a shame they couldn't put people in the restaurant who even had a mild interest in being there.
