BLOWN. AWAY.  The words "we will be back, we will be back" are marching through my brain like a chant! Marlee's Thai Bistro was amazing.  Between 4 of us we ordered a pot of Tom Ka Gai soup (best soup I've ever tasted and would go back tomorrow for this alone), shrimp pad thai, chicken panang curry, jalapeno fried rice, crab rangoon, and the burma gai. Everything was outstanding and so full of flavor. The only weak dish was the crab rangoon, but I'm also pretty picky about my rangoon. The rest of it though....fuggetaboutit.   Finally found a Thai place in AZ that I can rave about. Yummo!

Good coffee....just tough to wait in the long line to get it. Place was packed, but I expected that on a Sat morning. Cute ambiance and friendly staff.

I am ecstatic to have discovered such a gem in the neighborhood!!! I'm just sad it took me this long to eat at Hana! My husband and I went on Saturday night and had the best time. We waited a bit for a table...probably around 25-30 mins, but once we were seated, the service was quick. Our food came out fast and our server was friendly.   We ordered a tuna tataki roll and a spicy tuna roll...they both melted in our mouths. The tuna was so fresh and I am salivating now as I write this review. Also we ordered the gyoza which was good, but standard. My husband partook in a ramen noodle bowl and he loved it. The bowl was HUGE though. Order with caution...must be hungry or plan on sharing.   We will be back VERY soon and I cannot wait. It's so rare to find a solid sushi spot in PHX, but now we have our "go-to"...YAY.  BONUS: It's BYOB!

As soon as we walked in the door, we were carded by the hostess and given wristbands to wear so our waitress would know we were legal drinking age. I have to say that was a first for me at a restaurant. Bizarre, but ok, I get it...Tempe is a college town. They must have been busted previously.   Our server was very attentive and friendly. We liked her a lot. It was "interesting" to see 3 college aged guys behind the sushi counter rolling maki rolls. They probably went to ASU. This is who was making our sushi.   The garlic shrimp appetizer was amaze balls actually. I mean, really really good! The sushi however was below mediocre. Not much flavor and tasted like something I could purchase at a grocery store. A for effort, but not good. At. All.  Definitely will not go back, but once again the service was great. The sushi, not so much.

Great happy hour!! Free valet service. Very spacious place.  Traditional wings- Thumbs up! Awesome!! Pastor tacos- Decent. My husband liked them more than I did. Flatbread- Meh. Wouldn't order again.  The people next to us ordered the sliders with fries and the portion was huge. Looked really good.   Great spot. Food was decent, but nothing to write home about. Lots of energy and nice centralized location in Phx. We'll be back!!

We eat at Los Taquitos once  a week! I always get the same thing...3 shrimp street tacos, hold the pico. They are so fresh and full of flavor. The shrimpys have perfect grill marks on them. My husband gets the street tacos, but loads up on the meat ones...pollo, asada, barbacoa and carnitas and he devours them. The verde and red salsas that we pour onto each taco have a kick and great flavor. Don't pass on a Happy Hour margarita while you're there either. For $4.00, you get one of the best margs of your life. They are from scratch and contain zero artificial sweeteners or nasty sweet & sour mix.   My only complaint so far is weak guacamole. It makes me sad to type that, but it's true. The guac is kind of watery and flavorless. If they would improve the guac, this place could take over the world.

If you're going for brunch, skip it. Cool atmosphere, but the food wasn't impressive. Bloody Mary's were weak as well.

I'm a first time customer and I have to say it was pretty damn tasty! Don't let the outside fool you- the neighborhood is so-so, but the burgers are delish. I had a basic bacon cheeseburger with pickles, chipotle ketchup and mustard - SO good. Messy, but the burger held together well. My husband had their 'special' burger of the day which was a concoction of beer battered bacon, green chiles, celery, blue cheese and fried onions. He loved it! We also ordered the seasoned french fries and dipped those puppies in the chipotle ketchup and it was perfect! We will be back!

This place is the bomb dot com. Wow. Possibly the best pedicure experience I have ever had. Not only did Tracy massage my legs and feet with a sugar scrub, she proceeded to then massage with warm lotion and then topped all of that off with an oil hot stone massage!! What?! Is this real? The polish was painted on perfect...she didn't have to scrape any off of my cuticles which was a relief because sometimes that can really hurt!   Bonus: Tracy ended the appt by giving me a neck and shoulder massage for a few mins. I don't know if I went for a massage or a nail appt today?! $33. LOVE!

Decided to venture out for Chinese food on Christmas and chose this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews. Thank you, yelpers...it was delicious! It wasn't greasy and everything was fresh & hot. We had the general yang chicken, house fried rice and crab puffs. Everything was awesome- especially the crab puffs which are a hit or miss at most places. We will definitely be back very soon!

I've been here a few times now. I love the ambiance and music when I walk in. The food is amazing as well as their notorious macaroons...come to mama. The macaroons are so decadent and naughty but worth every morsel. The cappuccino is gorgeous upon arrival and delicious to the last drop.   Only negative- No wifi. What the heck?? It's 2015...get wifi already :)

Cute spot in Biltmore. Limited parking. I believe the drink I purchased was the 'Digest'? It was their cold pressed green juice. It was tasty. I love the sample tub and the woman working there walked me through each juice sample. She was helpful and friendly. Decent spot. The ambiance is meh...kind of uninviting. With all that said, I'll stop  by again when I'm in the area.

Sheila is a doll and an amazing esthetician as well. I left her office feeling like my skin could breathe again and I felt so refreshed. She explained the products she was using on me and was so gentle with the extractions. I highly recommend her services!

Randomly decided to stop and grab a pint of the baked beans after reading about them on Yelp and how good they are. They did not disappoint! Probably the best baked beans I have ever had! They are meaty and flavorful and paired well with the rack of ribs I had cooking at home in my oven. I can't wait to go back and give the brisket and pulled pork a try. If they taste anything like the baked beans did today, they will be dynamite!
